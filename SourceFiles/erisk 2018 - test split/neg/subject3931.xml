<TEXT> Were you the Shaman? You bought Shadow Blade, Dagon, Diffusal, and a Hood. That's really dumb.

Were you the Ursa? I mean he's the poorest one in the game but he ain't a support.

Were you the Lich? Your items look fine to me (except the Aether Lens seems kinda strange?), but you died 12 times. Don't die. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In quite a few prize winning authors I've read - thinking particularly of Marquez and Saramago at the moment, however there are more - the narrator will soon enough force himself into the narrative to say "Hey, here's what this passage *means*."

I don't really get it. You think writing so good that it wins an award would be subtle, something where you can derive your own meaning from it. Why are these writers so afraid their readers can't understand what they're trying to say? </TEXT>

I want to try out League, I really like how a lot of it is based around skillshots and that each champ has their own unique passive - but I'm back to square one, just as confused as when I started Dota.

Is my best bet just keeping a separate tab open on somewhere like champion.gg? Or is there something in-game that can help me that I've not discovered? </TEXT>

For that matter, what's the easiest way to take half of your mineral mining SCVs and send them to a second base? I'm always accidentally selecting the ones who are gathering vespene gas along with them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, normal mode is ... pitiful. I can stand right in the middle of a mob and not even take a scratch. I know when the game was released, you couldn't choose harder difficulty modes until you'd beaten the previous ones - is this still the case?

As for skill builds, are you ever forced to make a choice? I'm kinda wondering what is the point of creating new characters within the same class if you can respec at any time, any skill or any rune. 

And this isn't about difficulty, but what exactly is season mode? I've only ever played the Torchlight games so I'm not used to the concept of seasons in a hack and slash game. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The weird thing about reading One Hundred Years of Solitude is that the characters don't really have anything to them. There's Rebeca who eats dirt for some reason. There's Aurlieano who is soooo physically pained by seeing Remedios, a 9 year old girl he doesn't know, just because.. he's a pedo.. I guess..? There are so many moments where Marquez expects you to accept a character is feeling sadness or happiness or whatever, just at face value, without giving you a reason why.

While I'm really elaborating on this one book, I feel like it's a problem with a lot of capital L literature, which is a shame because the writing, line by line, is gorgeous. I'd love to read something with the composition of Marquez that has characters I can actually love and hate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is something I hear a lot in Dota, but at least it's true in that case. You can farm experience and items and make up for your teammates who die over and over. This is simply NOT possible in Overwatch. There aren't items to farm. If you have great aim, that's cool, but your entire team is still dead and you're 1 v 6. Slark or Phantom Assassin might be able to do that in Dota. You *cannot* 1 v 6 as Soldier or Tracer in Overwatch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't ever find a group of people I like to play with consistently, so I usually play alone. I used to be 1900 and fell down to 1100. I feel like I'm being punished. The most noticeable thing is I feel like there are a LOT more leavers, so it's incredibly difficult to win. On top of that,  my teammates are doing the dumbest things, like five DPS, and of course there's your typical Widow/Hanzo players with a 25% win rate. Also, it's very rare anyone talks on mic, and if they do it's usually to complain.

Is there any way to win these games as solo queue or do I have to find a group? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I can aim fairly well. At least, 40% is decent in my eyes, and on Zen it's often 50% or more. The reason I play Mercy is my teammates always overextend and die, so I can revive them and HOPEFULLY something good will happen after that. It's honestly a gamble. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just now finishing the Dark Tournament, episode 66. I've mostly been watching just to watch Yusuke finally kill Toguro, yet everything felt very anticlimactic. All these powerups just coming out of nowhere, the only one that felt earned was Yusuke absorbing Genkai's energy in the cave.

There's just not much story here, honestly. For like 30 episodes, it's nothing but a tournament. I like fighting, but there has to be a narrative behind it. The first part of the story where Yusuke has to nurse his spirit egg and interact with his friends through dreams, stuff like that, is quite a bit more captivating than what the series become. I especially like how the first storyline is quite emotional making me cry a few times. Nothing after Genkai's tournament really has any emotional impact.

And when the characters did fight in those early episodes, they used their cunning strategy (bouncing his Spirit Gun off a mirror to defeat Hiei, for example, or when Kurama pinpoints the heart of the stone beast Genbu in the Maze Castle) instead of their monstrous power.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've heard particularly from Unit Lost's Overanalyzed videos that it's terrible to defend anywhere the enemy can see you from their spawn. And this totally makes sense in theory, I try my best to tell my team to get to a better chokepoint and they'll rarely listen.

The thing is... when we're on attack and the enemy does the same thing to us, more than often, it's a success. Am I getting unlucky or is this a valid tactic as long as you don't die? Most players really don't seem to know how to deal with it, myself included. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ana/Widowmaker zoom sensitivity for scoped aiming - what "should" it be, and is it ok to make it the same as unscoped sens? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 22:17:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm honestly pretty new to snipers in shooters, but Ana appeals to me since she's a healer, and I guess if I get the hang of her I'd want to learn Widow eventually (though realistically I'd rather play Tracer or Soldier)

One thing that really hangs me up is the lower sens for scoped aiming. Now, I've already lowered my sens from what it used to be - a ridiculous 33 - down to a 10, with a DPI of 1000. This is still high according to some, however it's comfortable for me. 

I've currently got the scope sens to 20 and that feels too sluggish to me. What number do I use to make sure it's the same sens as my unscoped sens? Or should I just get used to it?  I've been doing unscoped in general, especially because I hear scoping gives you tunnel vision, but I like to scope to shoot Pharah/Mercy out of the sky.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like this is TOO MUCH of a team game, if that makes sense. Whether I get a 4-man rez with Mercy or 65% kill participation with D.Va, I don't feel like anything I do affects the outcome of the game. It's random chance if my teammates are going to do anything.

At least in Dota, I can farm for items if my teammates are bad. In Overwatch, most of the time it feels like "gg, hope you have better luck next time."

But surely that's not the case. There has to be some way to have a big impact and win more consistently. I know many will suggest communication, but most people don't seem to listen to anything said in the voice channel. You can warn about enemies coming to flank, your teammates are still going to die. So is there *anything else* I can do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is Reinhardt is incredibly boring, just holding a shield most of the game. At least that's how I think he should be played. So many Reins at my level just charge into the enemy team to die, and I really doubt you're supposed to be charging that often. They're probably getting antsy that holding a shield is so boring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I certainly don't pick her *specifically* to kill Pharah. But at the level where many Soldiers cannot aim, just as many Pharahs seem to be oblivious to the fact that a D.Va is slowly killing them. It's weird.

I do like the idea of eventually learning Zarya because of her bubble shield. Seems like a great way to get my teammates to actually break through chokes or to make sure someone like a Pharah doesn't get killed during her ult.

So do you think I should start learning Ana instead of Mercy? I've been wanting to lately, anyhow, it's mostly the difficulty of landing a sleep dart that's scaring me away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah this is really great, thanks. A lot of it is indeed obvious in hindsight, but seeing it written down makes it more tangible. I think the only downside to playing more D.Va is gonna be she's quite popular, so I'll have to instalock if I want her. 

The other downside being, of course, it's sometimes like pulling teeth to get anyone to go healer.. in which case I guess I can do it, but after 100 hours I'm not really seeing much progress on Mercy. Feels like an absolute gamble if your teammates are going to be able to deal damage or tank for you. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've played a LOT of Mercy and when I don't get her, I go with D.Va. I'm actually thinking about just not playing Mercy anymore because the last few times as D.Va I've got gold elims and like 55% kill participation. I feel like she's good hitscan for Pharah (though obviously not as damaging as others), her shield is absurdly helpful for the entire team, and my playtime on Mercy has really helped me learn baby D.Va's projectile pistol.

The one thing I'm REALLY bad at is using her ult. I feel like killing anyone with it is blind luck because, of course, most people are smart enough, even in silver, just to hide. Communication isn't really an option, either, in most games. Usually I try to talk on mic and no one responds, I'm really convinced a majority of this community plays without sound. So trying to combo with Zarya or Rein or something is a no-go (again, usually, sometimes you do get a great teammate) </TEXT>

In 90% of games, at least in silver, it's not like anyone is shotcalling. It's constantly this whining about their teammates. And I don't think the majority of them even listen to others, because I'll tell them "Reaper is behind us killing me," they make no attempt to do anything about it.

<TEXT>  Lastly, it is worth noting that many players do think "This is my skill level and I'm having fun here." It's just that those types of players aren't seeking out smallish DotA subreddits dedicated to improving at the game, so you don't hear from them as often.

Well, that's the thing. In the ideal scenario (and again, I know I don't always adhere to this philosophy) you think wanting tips and tricks would be solely for self-improvement. I don't necessarily care if that translates to higher MMR, I just want to know how to play my favorite heroes to the best of their abilities. 

And it really is human nature, because lately I'll try my best in either Overwatch or Dota to say "Ok I made a lot of mistakes here, I need better positioning." I'm absolutely fine with admitting I suck. But then the logic in my head will be, "While I made a lot of mistakes, my teammates made even MORE mistakes." Like.. I don't really care about the rank, I just don't enjoy losing, if that makes sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lucio, Tracer and Pharah all had their ult and we kept losing every team fight because they refused to use them until overtime. I don't understand this. You could use that ult then start building up for a new one. You could probably use two or three ults in the length of time you waited for the perfect time to use the one you had all match.

Am I thinking about this the wrong way? Is it a good habit to hold your ult? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, so I'm right in taking out the pistol during Mei or Zarya ult? Just seems to make sense, the thing does a "surprising amount of damage" and there's no need to heal anyone at that point. Is it safe to assume I should also pull out pistol for Orisa ult? That's what I usually do unless someone is desperately needing heals. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A few questions about Mercy's damage boost </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-28 22:35:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The more I play her, the more I realize Mercy is a deceptively complex hero. First you have to figure out who to prioritize on heals; then realize holding down space for descent is actually pretty useful (I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't use this for like a month or two); then you need to learn when and where to hide; then when and why to use pistol.

Now I'm finally following the advice that you should damage boost at any time you're not healing. Before I'd put it on healing even when they didn't need it, because I never trusted my teammates not to overextend, so they'd always have insurance to live. I've realized they don't really need this so much when the enemy is already dead because they put out more damage.

So I've got some questions.

1. Ult charge works off how much damage you do, right? I think? Does damage boosting your allies make them build up ult any faster?

2. If I damage boost Ana, does she heal teammates for 30% more of her normal healing? 

3. Is it worth it boosting a Rein or Winston or whoever that's already nanoboosted? Is the boost negligible at this point or is it always going to help?

4. Is there anything else important I need to know about damage boosting? </TEXT>

But Junkrat... I get tilted every time I see him. He doesn't seem to *do anything*. I main support and I can't think of any way to help him. Damage boost him as Mercy in the hopes his random grenades actually kill something? Discord as Zen for the same reason? Use an Ana nade so they can't heal through them? 

I just don't get the point of Junkrat or how I can make sure he's not a liability.  </TEXT>

At silver, everyone always stays on point. They say "Don't overextend, stay on point." I'd never been able to articulate why until watching that video, however this tactic always seemed stupid to me. If they can jump on you from any direction while on point, why would you stay there? Why wouldn't you move up to the chokepoint where there is less unpredictability?

<TITLE> Why is the formatting of many Kindle books still so bad? </TITLE>

<TEXT> This is my second time trying to use a Kindle, and while this time I lasted a few months instead of a couple weeks, I'm not really much happier with the state of things. So many books - and I don't mean indie books, I mean professionally done books from Random House or HarperCollins or wherever - still have hideous formatting. 

Whether it's a space after every paragraph, books that still don't have properly aligned typesetting, or other smaller issues that I can't recall, I don't understand this lack of polish. The space after every paragraph is what disturbs me the most and has single handedly made me start going with used paperbacks again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, the way this community treats "off-meta" heroes is so obnoxious and frustrating. And before you say "lol Hanzo main", no I'm a healer/support main. The condescending remarks to EVERY Hanzo, Widow, Torb, etc, is to the point I'm tempted to stop playing. I've never seen such aversion to certain heroes/classes in an online game. In Dota, the only heroes I know that trigger people into saying "what the fuck, why?" are Techies and Io. Two heroes out of 100+, whereas I'd say half of Overwatch's roster has its players whining like bitches.

I have to talk to my team like children in each pre-game, "Now guys, we've not seen them play yet. We have no reason to assume they're bad or throwing the game. Give them a chance." More often than not, I do get them to calm down, and hey what do you know, that Hanzo or Widow is actually making great plays throughout the match because the team didn't tilt them out of their minds!

It's just honestly the most goddamned stupid thing that people assume the worst before anything has even happened. </TEXT>

But since they have no intention of killing Symmetra, what the actual fuck can I do against her? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thing about sentries at 1k or 2k mmr, is that it's not uncommon the enemy "supports" will buy only 3 or 4 wards for the entire game. That's what the scoreboard tells me at the end of the game, anyhow. It's often a waste of money to buy a sentry unless you KNOW there's a ward because you just saw them walk up and put one down. And I guess being dewarded once breaks their little hearts and they just... stop buying any for the rest of the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't ever hear someone say "This isn't pro basketball, don't expect it to be." If you're playing a game of basketball with friends or random people, everyone knows roles like center and point guard, even just for fun when you're not very good, and the teams work out amongst themselves who's going to fill each role.

So isn't it a little absurd that Dota, a "sport" in its own right, doesn't work the same way? If everyone knows the positions to any other sport, why don't Dota players? Is it the fault of the game's tutorials, the community, what is it? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For those who don't know, OW has a system that factors in your individual performance as well as if you're on a winning/losing streak.

While I really like OW, personally I think the way this is handled is a joke. I asked their sub why this makes any sense and someone replied "Because you can perform extremely well and lose or perform badly and get carried." But in my opinion, all that matters is you lost. Who cares how well you did if you didn't get your team a win?

The other thing this does is really hurt support players. If you're not "on fire" (and as a support, you typically won't be), you don't earn as much SR at the end of a match. Imagine if Dota had the same, where supporting can already be miserable enough in some cases. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> People really like to complain about fetch quests, but I don't think they're all bad.

One example of a fantastic series of fetch quests is obtaining the Masamune in Chrono Trigger. You have to go up Denadoro Mountain in 600 AD to fight Masa   Mune in a physical form, then you must go back to 65,000,000 BC to find a stone that can aid in tempering the blade, all the while talking to Melchior the blacksmith a few times in between - but never does it feel like padding. Everything feels like it's building up in anticipation. Every new quest brings you closer to finishing the sword, and in your bones you can feel that something pivotal to the story is going to happen because of it.

<TEXT> The average carry at low MMR is also shit.

I'm actually convinced the reason players don't want supports is because games at low MMR tend to go on REALLY long. The longer you go, the less impact a support will have. Four or even five carries begins to sound more logical when you know the game is going to last an hour or more. </TEXT>

OK, I don't mind this on its own - the problem is if you try something that's not in the 1k-2k meta, they'll flame you. Forget trying to go support Riki, as an example, because they'll laugh and tell you it can't be done.

<TEXT> When you're listening to Tool, just remember that they're not like other bands. Their music is incredibly artistic, almost to the point where you have to be paying complete attention to them to even remotely understand them. I remember listening to a song on Lateralus (though I can't remember what it was), where I thought a song was absolute bollocks during the listen. Then, I closed my eyes for a second, and all of a sudden the song had an entirely new meaning. It was insane the way Tool could just become something so different when you take a look into the music.

Another thing you should note about Tool is that it's easy to get a headache listening to them. Not because they're a bad band, but because of how many ideas their music is riddled with and how complex they are. Soon enough your head will fill to the brim and the rest will just sound like noise to you. Just turn it off and give it a listen the next day.

If you don't like the music, you'll definitely at least enjoy reading through the lyrics, and picking apart the song itself and all of the artistic values that go into making it the complexity that it is. </TEXT>

edit: Something this community does not understand, that the Dota community has understood for a long time, is that counters ONLY matter at high levels of play. Sure, one hero counters another *on paper*. If you outplay your opponent, you're going to win even if they have three heroes specifically to counter you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Complaining about team comp when you're in solo queue is a little absurd, honestly. You cannot control your teammates. All you can do is play around them. You have no right to whine about any of their picks because that's what you signed up for by picking solo queue. If you think there are too many dps or tanks, or no healers, or whatever, you are just as capable as anyone else to make the switch.

You should expect the unexpected in solo queue and find a way to deal with it. Fussing about "team comp" for players that don't want to play nice is a wasted effort. Either find a way to win in solo queue or find five other players you can consistently team up with. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How many of you would name Undertow as your favorite Tool album? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-16 05:31:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The production on Undertow is so good, everything is so cavernous and echo-y, it feels both enormous and suffocating at the same time. Or maybe that's the compressed mp3s I'm used to listening to for them, not 100% sure... but I love it.

The lyrics are more down-to-earth, too. Lateralus got a little too mystical and preachy for me. I'd say the only thing I miss from the later albums is Maynard's more peaceful moments, but in general I'd say Undertow remains their best. </TEXT>

<TITLE> When you're listening to Tool, just remember that they're not like other bands. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-16 01:52:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [this is from the GameFAQs Music: Rock message board, always thought it was fucking hilarious]

When you're listening to Tool, just remember that they're not like other bands. Their music is incredibly artistic, almost to the point where you have to be paying complete attention to them to even remotely understand them. I remember listening to a song on Lateralus (though I can't remember what it was), where I thought a song was absolute bollocks during the listen. Then, I closed my eyes for a second, and all of a sudden the song had an entirely new meaning. It was insane the way Tool could just become something so different when you take a look into the music.

Another thing you should note about Tool is that it's easy to get a headache listening to them. Not because they're a bad band, but because of how many ideas their music is riddled with and how complex they are. Soon enough your head will fill to the brim and the rest will just sound like noise to you. Just turn it off and give it a listen the next day.

If you don't like the music, you'll definitely at least enjoy reading through the lyrics, and picking apart the song itself and all of the artistic values that go into making it the complexity that it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Put me in my place, tell me why I'm wrong.

So I'm a Mercy main. Started off at 1900 SR, had a huge losing streak and dropped to 900 SR, now I'm back to 1500 SR. I've noticed that DPS players *seem* to be less effective as I climb, like their accuracy or positioning or *something* is lacking.

Is this just a case of being on tilt from a losing streak and *perceiving* their lack of skill? Because it doesn't make sense how they'd be worse at 1500 than they were at 1000, yet that's sometimes what it feels like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not saying you shouldn't also make some attempt to shut down her jungling, but in my experience, Legion players have really bad positioning. If you put up wards around where you think she'll try to sneak up to you, you'll be able to avoid her long before anything happens. 

And the bracket that has poor Legions will typically also have poor (or nonexistent) support, so they're not going to catch on what's happening. All they're going to do is blame Legion for having no duels at 20 minutes. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This might be luck, or if it's not, it might be obvious to a lot of you. But I used to lose a lot of games and I felt a little useless as Mercy despite keeping my team constantly healed. What I find is that my team doesn't really make any attempt to target the enemy Mercy. So when everyone is top health and the enemy healer is out of position, I'll take out my own gun and kill them.

I don't know for how much longer this will work, but for right now it's really helped me win a lot of games, instead of just HOPING my teammates will kill the healer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have kids of my own and don't really plan on it, so it's possible I'm overreacting here.

My sister is 22 and she has two twins that are 2 and a half years old. She doesn't really talk to them unless she's yelling for them to "Quit!" fighting or if she says "eat? do you want some food?" She puts TV shows like Power Rangers or occasionally something educational, which I guess is better than nothing, but SHE doesn't read to them, play with them, interact with them.

I wonder to myself, sometimes, why she didn't just get a couple extra dogs or cats if she's going to put in the bare minimum for parenting. Like I said, am I overreacting here? I've been around a few other kids around their age, and they could talk more than my nephews. I try to read to them every now and then, but I don't think that's enough if their mom or dad doesn't want to do the same. </TEXT>

He was Mercy and his friend was Pharah and he barely healed anyone else all game. Scarred me enough that I don't ever want to give someone Mercy again if I can help it. What is the most polite way to tell someone I've already locked in my hero without getting them to throw the game or whatever?

And does Pharmercy ever actually work? I've played a shit ton of Mercy and I've never actually seen the point. For me, Pharah is largely a great target to fly to, so I can remain ever more elusive. Pocketing her doesn't ever seem to work, whether it's someone on my team or the enemy team. This is partially due to players doing what this guy did and ignoring the rest of his team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But it shouldn't tilt you. I know it's a cliche that you hear so many times on this sub, but it's a cliche for a reason: you are the only constant player on your team and you need to focus on YOUR play. Next game is going to be four brand new "idiots" for you to deal with, while the fifth player will always be you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're on a huge winning streak and you lose - well, so what? You're never going to achieve a 100% win rate, not even pro gamers have done something so ludicrous. Instead, you need to brush it off as just another game. Whether it's because you played poorly, your entire team played poorly, or the enemy team was much more coordinated than you - or a combination of all those factors - you lost and there's nothing you can do. 

Examine what you did wrong, fix the mistakes, and then remain optimistic for the next game. And if you lose your next game as well, it's the same thing: sometimes you have losing streaks just the same as winning streaks. Don't assume it means anything, other than the fact you're possibly tilted and need to take a break. </TEXT>

One of the best scenes in BrBa is when Walt talks to Crazy 8 in the basement, it's so well done. By contrast, the writing of Saul feels like nothing is at stake. Part of this is probably because it's a prequel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because there is such a lack of reports, players are much more rude and troll-y. And hey, why shouldn't they be? There's no repercussion. No one is going to stop them because *there aren't any reports*. I'd honestly rather play low priority at this point, but I can't even do that, because no one can report me!

So.. yeah.. this has been a cute little experiment, Valve, but can we get our reports back? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find him annoying and that's what is so fascinating to me. Salinger is an excellent writer in that he can write a teenager so convincingly. When I read more contemporary stuff that tries to do teenagers (John Green as an example), that doesn't at all feel like a real person. At least with Salinger, even if I don't like Holden, I'm very impressed by his ability to create a character.

In fact, I was so impressed that the first time I read Franny and Zooey, the writing floored me. For a second I confused the character with the writer and said to myself, "The guy who wrote The Catcher in the Rye can write like *that*?" </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never read anything from Austen, partially because there's this reputation about them of being the "chick lit" of classic literature. The synopses of them all seem to suggest there's a lot of marriage and love in them, which seems to explain the stereotype.

Now I don't necessarily hate those things. "Chick lit", however, implies to me that the characters are one-dimensional and don't have much to them. Is this true at all or are her novels just as good as any other classic? Northanger Abbey in particular sounds pretty neat, in that it's supposed to be metafiction/parody about Gothic novels of the 1700s. </TEXT>

Perhaps he didn't specify that offlaners in particular should focus on harassing? All I know is I feel like my decisions (with his help) really helped me win that game 10 or 15 minutes more quickly than I would have otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aha, so that explains a scene in the recent series starring Benedict Cumberbatch where Sherlock is quite annoyed a magazine got a photo of him in the hat.

I really need to get around to reading the actual novels/stories. As far as I know, most/all of them are written by Watson, right? Reminds me of how Nick Carroway narrates The Great Gatsby, a side character observing the "main" character. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a quote from n0tail, a pro Dota player. I've always wondered just how serious he's being here, but joke or not, there's a bit of truth in here and I think it can apply to Overwatch just as much as Dota.

If you are a Winston, for example, and see that your team is still at the first chokepoint on King's Row and you're frustrated they're not taking the point... you aren't actually doing anything helpful by charging to the point to "contest" it. The only thing you're doing is helping the opponent build ult charges with your every death. So honestly, if your team isn't listening to your demands on mic to follow you - stick with them instead, get a couple picks, and find your opportunity to push.

Because if you do "the smart thing" on your own, you're only helping the enemy team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's the thing. As a support, I hold on to my stun until the end because I know the average teammate is going to blow all their spells too soon, not even attempting to chain stun.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Modern stuff, I can read that just fine. With classics, there is this strong desire in me, at first subconscious and now I've fully realized it, that I must have a physical copy. The way I see it, if it's something good enough to re-read over and over, I should have a copy that will last. The reason I find this a bit ironic, of course, is that you can easily read these for free in the public domain... but it's hard to really pay attention to something when you don't have a physical copy, at least for me.

Anyone else feel this way? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is partly venting, partly asking how to remember them. This is one reason I tend to stick to the same heroes so I have a very good feel of their attack range. When I try a new hero, and the range is shorter or longer, I get disoriented. It's really my least favorite part of the game.

How do I remember these ranges, exactly? Is it just one of those things where you have to play for a long time and get a feel for them? I've played for probably around 2000 hours over the past couple years and this is still tripping me up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jeez this is a lot more than I'd thought I would get, thanks a lot.

A lot of this is stuff I can't explain away because I know I suck, but I'll attempt to describe why I did what I did at 3:15, and that is I'm too nice. In the back of my head I'm ALWAYS thinking I shouldn't be stealing farm from anyone, so I'm afraid to hit anything... even if it's in a solo lane, apparently. That's the same reason I tend to build tranquils almost every game, because I'm locked into this mindset that I'm going to be roaming, even when that's not the case. 

So part of my problem is I need to build more greedy items in some games instead of the medallion/force staff thing. I'm not really good at figuring out which games that would be a good idea, though. </TEXT>

Or is this one of those unwinnable scenarios? I hope not, because this type of thing happens at 1k mmr far too often than I'd like. I pick support, someone picks jungle. So we have a dual offlane and then I'm 1 vs 2. I don't think I died during laning phase, but Sniper and PA managed to take a tower and a half from bot lane off the back of this - because what the fuck am I gonna do against that alone?

<TEXT> This is why I don't understand all the bickering at low MMR. It's a complex game and we're ALL making mistakes. Why whine at your teammates about them instead of saying "it's ok, I would have probably done the same thing in your shoes"? In fact, I'd say this one attitude change alone has helped me win more games. 

The only time I really get mad at teammates anymore is when they do something like Nature's Prophet jungle, because while I can forgive a lot of supposedly dumb shit and say "this is 1k, we'll find a way to make it work", jungling still seems like an absolute waste of time to me. Especially when I am our only support who is going solo against a dual lane because of their selfish decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing I love about Dota is it's OPTIONAL to display your MMR. This is great so people in unranked can't whine about how my skill level isn't acceptable to them. As far as I can tell, this isn't possible in Overwatch - so if you've been on a terrible losing streak, people are gonna whine about it in Quick Play when all you want to do is have some fun.

<TEXT> I've read Jane Eyre and bits of Anne Bronte. Didn't have any trouble at all with them. Then there's Wuthering Heights and for the most part I'm quite confused and I feel stupid. The grammar is so different. 

Was Emily paying homage to a different, earlier style of writing? Or is her style just simply more difficult than her two sisters? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've read Jane Eyre and loved it. I tried to read Wuthering Heights last night and the grammar was so bizarre and hard to understand (and I don't just mean the Yorkshire accent) that I couldn't follow much of it. I thought maybe I'd got more stupid over the last year. Then I read the start of Anne Bronte's two novels to test it out, and nope, those are easy to understand.

<TEXT> I'd been playing quite a bit of unranked, thinking "oh ranked is so toxic and competitive I should just play unranked"

But after a while unranked is also toxic and competitive, which is bizarre since it's just unranked.

THEN I realized perhaps what is toxic and competitive... is probably me. So I'm playing ranked again and actually having a lot of fun because people want to win. As long as I start off with something positive like "hey guys I'm gonna support and we're gonna win", people actually don't bicker like children too much.

Does unranked really have any use once you can play ranked, especially if it stresses me out much more than ranked for some weird reason? </TEXT>

Is there a particular reason long books are sold as bulky tomes like this? I mean, I know I've read back in the 1800s that larger novels were published in three parts. Why did that practice fade away? </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK so I've been playing a bit of Overwatch. Something that is very bizarre to me is you're punished if you leave too many Quick Play matches, despite having a drop-in drop-out system like TF2 or many other shooters. I like to leave if I don't like the map, basically.

The even more bizarre thing for me is how the community, from what I've heard on reddit at least, really agrees with this practice. Despite having a dedicated competitive mode, they think leaving in quick play is extremely rude and that you should play just as seriously as in competitive.

This doesn't make sense to me. When I played TF2 more often, I don't remember anyone EVER saying "shit, why did that guy leave? This sucks." People just came and went, and that's how it was, and they just had fun.

Or am I remembering it wrong? Do people get annoyed when other players leave in TF2? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's an interesting bit about it I found from an NPR article:

Moby Dick, despite its reputation as a bore, was intended to be  and actually is  one of the funniest books of all time. To save the whale from misunderstanding, all it takes is to realize that the narrator, Ishmael, is an irreverent wisecracker, forever making jokes at the expense of landlubbers, society, religion, his fellow sailors and himself. He's a terrible shipmate, falls asleep on watch in the crow's nest, is always about to tumble overboard, generally gets in the way of the killing of the whales, and is invariably more involved in his own ruminations than in the spume and storm around him. Ishmael is like Shakespeare's clowns: equal part comedian and tragedian, philosopher and cutup, always ready with the barbed aside or incisive aphorism. And all that encyclopedic stuff? It's playful  and often ironic. Give it another look and you'll see almost immediately that Melville's tongue couldn't have been more in his cheek. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read Crime and Punishment, Notes, and most of Karamazov in high school and loved it. Still somehow never read any Tolstoy, though I do own Anna Karenina. As for Gogol... I tried recently to read Dead Souls, and man, was I bored. It's probably partly to do with hearing about it for years and years and building up hype. All I know is in the first chapter there is a LOT of scenery description. I read mostly for interesting characters, so I have to say that book didn't have the best first impression on me. </TEXT>

Ditto on Madame Bovary, always wanted to read that because I hear it's one of the first psychological novels. Part of the reason I've not read them yet is I'm never sure which translations are the "best", so I get kinda indecisive and never get around to reading them.

A lot of your other recommendations also sound like the type of thing I've considered and forgotten over the years.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is going to sound like nothing more than a complaint thread just by the title, but hear me out.

I've not played Dota for a few months. Decided to reinstall and play a bit of unranked. Usually I'll support, but this time I'm like, fuck it, I'll have some fun and carry. Then I remember the reason I don't carry: it is not at all fun to fight with *your own support* for farm.

But instead of whining about it... I want to find a way to work around it. How do I farm (and gain levels faster) if they're always in lane with me and always taking my last hits? Should I treat them like a creep and try to hit it before I know they're going to hit it, so my hit still goes last? Should I buy a quelling blade in 100% of my games as carry? Any other tips in overcoming "supports" like these that are all too common at low MMR? </TEXT>

 I'm really thinking Zenyatta is the far better support. Yeah he can't heal as much, but he CAN heal. It's enough to keep them alive. And if they're dumb enough to rush in 1 vs 6 as they so often are, no amount of healing is going to save them- because I refuse to chase them and die along with them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know games take a long time, but... I think they released this to the public too early. If it were initially released when it was more polished, I feel like there would be more hype. Once it's finished, or even once it's in beta, can they attract a large player base when it's already been out in the wild for a few years? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've tried for months to get into Overwatch, thinking it would have the fast paced gameplay I like from UT. And.. it does for the most part.. but the actual shooting part is disappointing. I know its players like to tell me over and over that skill is important and I know they're probably right. That doesn't stop me from feeling like every time I lose, or even when I win, it's because someone pressed Q to use an OP ult. 

All I want is a game that's *not* press Q to win, where you can win solely based on your aim and awareness.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I leave quick play  Overwatch matches quite often because of getting maps I don't like. There's a drop-in and drop-out system where I'm replaced almost immediately by someone else, so I didn't see any harm. But you're actually punished for this after a while and the game doesn't tell you. 

I made a thread complaining about this odd design choice over on the game's reddit and about a dozen people come and say I'm ruining the game for the rest of my team. I'm sorry, what? In a casual game mode? Drop-in drop-out is old as dirt and, in any online game I've ever played, no one has ever said "man I wish these people would stop leaving so I can have a serious match."

Because I think people used to understand video games are primarily for fun. If I don't like the current map, I'm not having fun. I think a lot of people have forgotten the "fun" thing, instead choosing to believe they're practicing to be the next esports champ or some such cancerous bullshit.

I thought unranked game modes were meant to be a safe haven from this elitist mentality that games are Serious Business. But with games like OW and Dota, that's simply not the case. Their players treat unranked just as if it were as serious as a tournament.  </TEXT>

[Here's an article about it.](http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/02/10-ways-adult-entertainment-changed-the-tech-industry) Porn is why VHS won over betamax as the home video standard, for example.

 And another one is this one: "Ever looked at porn on a dial-up connection? Brutal. Penthouse magazine was ahead of the curb in the '90s when it began distributing 2400-baud modems to its readers so they could have faster access to the companys XXX bulletin boards." 

Unfortunately, this article also says that porn is responsible for DRM  and geolocational advertisement... so it's not all stuff that your average redditor would appreciate.

And while I don't know what porn did for technology before the 1970s, I wouldn't be surprised if there's something out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did focus on objectives. That is all I did. I played support so I didn't steal farm during the laning phase (I am not about to fight with someone else over farm - doesn't matter who's in lane with me, another carry or support or whatever wacky combo 1k mmr can dream up, they're going to take my farm). I would always abandon the silly mexican standoff at mid and start doing chip damage to top or bot tower. 90% of the time, I was unpunished and could get a tower down to 75% or 50% health.

So you'll say "ok stop playing support and carry yourself out" - this does not work because people who play Dota are little babies. Like I said, if you start "stealing the farm" from the other four carries on your team, at least one of them is going to start whining and get tilted - either feeding, staying in fountain, or abandoning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's say you've been living under a rock and you've never heard of Henry Fonda or Bryan Cranston. You don't know that they're typically portraying good guys. So if you watch Once Upon a Time in the West or Breaking Bad, you don't get the "oh shit" moment where you see these men are playing very different roles compared to most of their previous work.

Does this diminish the story, the acting? Do you need to know an actor or actress is playing against type to appreciate their rarely seen dramatic/comedic skills more than you would have without knowing about them? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's something interesting I heard recently that I feel is a bit related to Breaking Bad. Before Once Upon a Time in the West, Henry Fonda was largely considered as an actor who played good guys, the ones you want to win. And then in this western, suddenly he's playing against type as a murderer.

Sounds an awful lot like Breaking Bad to me, the way no one would have ever expected Hal to be a bad guy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, part of the reason I have trouble surviving as offense or defense as opposed to tank or support is that people don't usually play support unless you beg them.. or if they do, they don't seem to heal anyone. I realize this game is clearly based around teamwork, so if my team has either no healer or a poor healer, then trying to deal damage is going to be incredibly risky. 

Right now I play mostly Mercy and Zen. I'm really thinking about ditching Mercy entirely because she can't shoot while healing. Or at least, I think I'll keep her in my pocket if I notice one of my teammates has really good aim, because then the damage boost actually will do something.

As for non-support, I mean Soldier is one of the easiest, especially because of his healing, and I usually win with him... and that's about it. Everyone else seems to die too fast. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I play a lot of Mercy. Part of this is that I legitimiately love playing a healer. Another part is I'm a pessimist and know my idiot teammates are going to overextend, so at least I can heal them so they can hopefully not die.

But another reason is that every other hero in this game feels so goddamned squishy. At least with her, I can use Guardian Angel to keep weaving in and out. If I play anyone else, the enemy team can sneeze at me and I die. 

I realize the logic is you balance out the mobility and firepower with being easy to kill ... but still, they die way too easily. And then there's all these bullshit ults that are a bandaid over poor aim, the most obvious example being Soldier 76's autoaim ult. What am I supposed to do to stay alive?

And getting down to the real reason I'm probably asking this, do I even need to play a healer? At low skill where I am begging my teammates to turn around, look at their surroundings, and actually shoot the goddamned Pharah in the sky, should I just play a damage hero myself, until I get to the point I can play healer with people who understand they have a mouse? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, sure. You can absolutely avoid most ults in most situations. But I think that's a problem. 

At low skill where people will often stumble blindly into an ult, they are the determining factor. It's 90% ult and 10% aim.

At high skill where people have fantastic game sense and can avoid ults, aim is the determination factor. It's 90% aim and 10% ult.

So considering they're largely worthless at high skill and that they're a way to compensate for poor decisions at low skill, I'd say they're all around a terrible mechanic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've still not read more than a few of his stories in Dubliners, but oh man this letter makes me laugh every time...

 My sweet little whorish Nora
I did as you told me, you dirty little girl, and pulled myself off twice when I read your letter. I am delighted to see that you do like being fucked arseways. Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. My prick was stuck up in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue come bursting out through your lips and if I gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Noras fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.

 You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over me with a whores glow in your slumbrous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lovers fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometime too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your hot drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darlings cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.

 Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird! There is one lovely word, darling, you have underlined to make me pull myself off better. Write me more about that and yourself, sweetly, dirtier, dirtier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I get your logic. I've had my Kindle now for a month, and I do get that overwhelming sense of choice that comes from pirating retro games. And I'm not even pirating the books, I'm using an Overdrive library. I wishlisted 800 books immediately upon buying my Kindle, so excited to have access to all of these books that were before too expensive to buy all at once... and then a day or two later, the choice paralysis hit me. 

So I'm already rationalizing to myself, "well I'll use ebooks as a way to sample books, and any of them I like enough to finish, I'll buy a physical copy." The downside to this is I'm really impatient and will quit a book within 20 pages or something, telling myself it's not worth it and that I have hundreds more books to try out.

I've got mixed feelings about the whole thing, I guess you could say. </TEXT>

But the chronology is so strange. Immediately following is the "chemistry is the study of change" scene. Then you get Walt's cancer diagnosis, then the 50th birthday breakfast, then all of a sudden Gretchen and Elliott's party.

<TEXT> Gonna have to say no. Skipped around the first 15 minutes and it's so choppy. Things begin with the scene where Walt and Skyler are buying their house, years ago, interspersed with a couple shots of Walt from season 5 looking at his vandalized house. I'll admit that was interesting and got my hopes up.

But the chronology is so strange. Immediately following is the "chemistry is the study of change" scene. Then you get Walt's cancer diagnosis, then the 50th birthday breakfast, then all of a sudden Gretchen and Elliott's party. And then a little after that, you get to see Walt on his trip with Hank to watch them bust a meth lab.

It just feels very disjointed, and not in an interesting Tarantino-esque way. </TEXT>

If anything, maybe someone from the past would be BETTER for that purpose.

<TEXT>  However, maybe try to focus on one book at the time, because sometimes the issue isn't the book itself but your attention span. Juggling several novels at the time could certainly reduce the pleasure and investment you can have in either of them.


I think this is probably the biggest thing. I need to stop trying to read four books at the same time. 

And as for exhausting great books and then starting on good books, I've always more enjoyed the idea of just re-reading the great ones. If they're good enough for me to finish, it's almost always because they had to depth to them that I can appreciate even more on a second or third reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, so I've had a Kindle for about a month now. I'm loving that I don't have to buy books and can just borrow from thousands of books from my library. 

But... I can't bring myself to buy an ebook. There's something weird about it to me, partly due to paranoia of what would happen to my books 10 or 20 years in the future. So for my absolute favorites, I'll keep buying physical books.

A lot of the more interesting books I've noticed lately happen to be from NYRB Classics. So I want to ask, does the binding or the pages feel cheap? I got a few newer books shortly before I got my Kindle, namely Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles and Camus' The Plague, and both of them honestly felt like they'd fall apart if I sneezed on them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's the problem, high school teachers tend to phrase their interpreations in such a way that they're the objectively correct ones. They don't even hint at the possibility that there are two, five, twenty, hundreds of other interpretations. I realize this is partially to simplify things, but I don't think they understand the damage this does for students. An opportunity to reignite (or begin) a love for reading is lost.

A little story. My junior year teacher had us read one book a month for Accelerated Reader (idk if you've heard of it, it's pretty stupid, you can only read certain books that have a comprehension quiz attached to them.) I read Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury and Woolf's To the Lighthouse back-to-back. Understandably, I would think, I was a little bit mentally exhausted. So after that, I decided I'd try McCullers' The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. But my teacher was like "You know you're smarter than that, why don't you pick something else?" Bitch, are you serious? If I didn't already love reading, I'd have probably been turned off from it for a long at that moment.

I understand reading can and should be used for learning/enlightenment - and this is still my favorite use for it, part of why I'm so A.D.D. about what I read, can't easily find something that suits me - but it's also for entertainment. To put down the McCullers just because it's not as deep as Faulkner or Woolf seems a little absurd to me, especially because it's still more substantial than plenty of other things I could be reading. </TEXT>

When they ask something like "Why was this piece of clothing/furniture red or blue or green", I'm always thinking who gives a fuck? On the other hand, I read literary criticism of my favorite authors like Salinger or Woolf just for fun. I feel like they always had more interesting and surprising insights than my teachers.

<TEXT> All my life, basically, I've been the kind of person who has a short temper with books. If I'm not enjoying it within 20 pages or less, I'll put it down. This is part of the reason I bought used books, because I know I'm hard to please and I'm not about to buy a new book that might bore me.

Now that I have a Kindle and access to thousands of titles through Overdrive, this habit hasn't changed. I'll check out four or five books at a time and usually return all but one of them. 

It's rare that I finish books. I'm the polar opposite of the kind of person who will stubbornly finish a book no matter how much they hate it. I don't necessarily see anything wrong with this, though I do sometimes wonder... do I really enjoy reading as a whole, or just certain particular stories? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll admit I've still not seen a whole lot of anime outside of Dragon Ball, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop, and Madoka Magicka. But I can tell you I'm not a huge fan of DBZ now that I'm older. Sure, it looked badass when I was a kid, all those flashy lights... but now it seems incredibly lazy compared to something like Goku vs Krillin.

Cowboy Bebop has interesting fights, though I've got a different problem with that series in that there's little to no story. I know there are pieces here and there, but it's largely episodic, which I don't think works outside of like a mystery show.

I've been meaning to watch more of Yu Yu Hakusho. How do the fights in that show play out? Are they more interesting than DBZ's Kamehameha waves? </TEXT>

This is such an oddly gamer mentality, too. I've never seen anyone say "I'm burnt out on movies, how do I bring back the passion?"

<TITLE> My biggest problem with John Oliver is his total lack of respect for his viewers' intelligence. </TITLE>

<TEXT> This is perplexing to me considering his show is on HBO, a network that prides itself on smart writing, and yet that's the feeling I get from his jokes. The subjects he chooses to report are almost always fascinating on their own merit, and his urgent tone keeps me captivated, yet it's like clockwork where he'll say "oh shit, not had a joke in a minute or two... should say something funny so I don't bore them!"

I know you can say, "that's the point... it's a comedy show..." but the problem is he's just not funny in this environment. He's much better at the serious stuff, ironically enough. I think they should either toss out the jokes or get better joke writers, though again the very inclusion of jokes seems to imply HBO doesn't respect the intelligence of their viewers to watch the news on its own merit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't necessarily appreciate the idea that this is the "real history" or whatever - but it's certainly more interesting. I love reading how normal people centuries ago lived their lives, from their own words. So much of traditional history in school is about kings and presidents, and while that's obviously important, it's also a little hard to relate to the dry politics without knowing how the people felt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think people are misrepresenting their interest in Zinn when they say shit like "the real truth" - for me, the reason he's so fascinating is the focus on showing personal documents of common people, those that were affected by the big political decisions we read about in history books. It's not "the real truth" - it's a different side to the same truth. I get bored of reading about kings and queens, presidents and whatever. I want to know how people like you and me reacted to history as it happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a way to borrow ebooks from a public library. As an example, here is the [Brooklyn Public Library Overdrive](https://brooklyn.overdrive.com/). If you're out-of-state, you do need to pay a yearly fee of $50, however I'd say that's a great deal for their collection of 120,000+ books when you consider Netflix is almost twice that amount per year. And of course, your own public library also has an Overdrive, more than likely. I paid for an out-of-state library card because my local library didn't have nearly enough of what I wanted to read. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After Toy Story 3, I began to suspect they were manipulating their audience's heartstrings too transparently. With Inside Out, I confirmed my suspicion. When I felt sad near the end because of her emotions shutting down, also I felt insulted. They weren't even trying to hide anymore what they were doing.

When I caught up and finally saw The Good Dinosaur recently, this is dialed up to 11. There is barely a story to all of this. It's just "crushingly emotional scene" after "crushingly emotional scene." I'm not saying a family/children's movie isn't allowed to be sad - but this one in particular took it too far. There didn't appear to be any reason or motive beyond "Hey we're Pixar, this is what we do!"

Their animation is still the best in the business. It's just too bad their storytelling is so manipulative and formulaic. The one glimmer of hope for me is The Incredibles 2, because I'm HOPING it's going to be more about a good story instead of obvious tearjerking moments. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know they play all these tricks to hide their lack of content, but I'm starting to suspect that's even more true than we realized. I go to the Western subgenre and there are only 22 titles. Of these, there are five that I think anyone would want to watch. Once Upon a Time in the West, El Dorado, The Sons of Katie Elder, Blazing Saddles, and The Good the Bad and the Weird.

The first is what I'd say is the one true selling point. The following two are included only by virtue of starring John Wayne, however they're not his most famous. Blazing Saddles is a comedy more than anything. The Good the Bad and the Weird is a Korean action movie that is influenced somewhat by Westerns, but I'd hardly call it a Western.

And similarly shocking small numbers are found on other genres. Is the subscription cost of Netflix now basically a way to fund their original programming? Because unless there's something wrong with the sorting and there's something more (and I'm not expecting HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS, but damn), they're not really delivering much of anything in the way of good movies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Finally. Hard to find anyone who agrees with me the ending wasn't entirely perfect. I feel like maybe I'd have enjoyed it more, even unchanged in its current form, if that season were longer or if less of the episodes were "number of the week" - I'm someone who enjoyed season 1 and 2 when it was more episodic, but once the Machine/Samaritian battle was underway, going back to that felt awkward.

As for the ending itself... I felt there were too many happy endings. If any one of them were to have happened in isolation, then that's fine - but all in one episode felt cheap to me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> For those who don't use Goodreads, how do you keep track of what you've read and where do you get your recommendations? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I've had a Kindle for about a month now and I've been reading a lot more thanks to Overdrive libraries. But there's a small problem with this, which is cataloging which books I've finished, which I've started and put down (a lot of them, but this isn't at all a new habit), and then which books to read next.

I tried Goodreads and I don't know... not only does it feel clunky, I'm wary of receiving recommendations from a website that focuses so much on young adult fiction. Not that I don't enjoy a good YA novel every now and then, but they're such a small part of what I read.

So for anyone who doesn't use something like Goodreads to generate recommendations for you - where do you usually find them and how do you keep track of them? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a hack of the original NES, which as far as I can see, isn't as popular to hack as Super Metroid. I can understand this, since Super is arguably the more classic of the two. I gotta say, though, what I've played of this game so far is stellar, to the point I'd gladly donate some money to the developer. He's turned a game that I've never enjoyed as much as its sequel into something magical. 

It's this quirky blend of Cave Story-esque platforming with exploration - the kind that I've not really felt since I played Super Metroid as a kid. There are all these hidden passages and, even with the mini-map, you'll probably get lost. But it's the enjoyable kind of lost. Also, the music and art are both stellar. There are also occasional health recharge spots, which is such a rewarding feeling, seeing them really tells you that you're headed in the right direction. Also you can save by pressing select+A+B at the start menu, so that's pretty awesome.

Honestly, between AM2R, Hyper Metroid, and this, we're kinda spoiled by top-tier fan projects lately. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For different reasons, I've never really played the original Metroid. One of the bigger reasons is what little I did play seemed very copy-and-paste, like all these huge vertical corridors with nothing interesting in them.

So I'm playing this Super Metroid hack called Retroid which pretties up NES Metroid and gives it a map system, while also taking away stuff like wall jump to make sure it's as accurate as possible. I've played now for half an hour, actually got bombs and hi-jump this time instead of giving up out of boredom and.. my suspicion seems to be correct. This game is boring as fuck.

And I don't get it. Why? It's not like Nintendo couldn't handle non-linear gaming back then. The only thing outdated really about the first Zelda is the graphics, the game design is still top notch. Metroid NES feels so simple that it's a wonder enough people bought it to get a sequel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen this for a few shows lately, though the only one I can remember is The Amerians, where the wiki page says " The 13-episode fifth season will premiere on March 7, 2017, followed by a 10-episode sixth and final season in 2018."

Does this mean they film both seasons back to back, or do they still take a break until next time just as if there had been only one season ordered? Or is this perhaps something that varies from production to production? </TEXT>

Fuck, I need to start watching your flair before anything else. The Americans' premise seems so cool. I don't even know anything about it except "spies in America during the cold war" but I mean.. hey, that's enough to intrigue me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read The Windup Bird Chronicle, Kafka on the Shore, and Hard-Boiled Wonderland. Also read like 20 pages of 1Q84 but gave up, kinda got bored.

For me, Hard-Boiled Wonderland is easily the best of the three novels of the three Murakami novels I've read. The first few pages in particular are brilliant because they seemed to me like a cute tangent that didn't have anything to do with the plot despite being well-written - but in the end, it was excellent foreshadowing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is after so many fake deaths of Clara since her introduction, she did not deserve "closure." She died and came back to life so many times that I wanted her to stay dead. Last Christmas could have been a fitting end, yet they brought her back once again. And then with Hell Bent, not only did they revive her - *again* - but they imply she is going to live forever traveling the universe with Me in her own goddamned TARDIS. 

I know you can say this is a children's/family show and letting her die would be depressing, but the fact that her death has essentially no negative repercussions (because honestly, what are the chances she will go back to her "proper death") makes me so mad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This seems to confirm my suspicions more than anything. Also reminded me the National Book Award is a thing. Looking at the list of winners between Pulitzer, NBA, and Booker, I think it's mostly the Booker (of the small selection of books I've read, anyhow) that strikes me as very dry and boring. Pulitzer and NBA generally have much more interesting books, again from the ones I've read. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now I'm the type who enjoys literature with a capital L just as much as genre fiction, however almost every time I pick up a book that's received the Booker or Pulitzer, I'm bored out of my mind. It's the dry writing more than anything, which makes me wonder if these committes and judges choose the winners based more on the culturally aware subject matter more than the writing itself.

Assuming that is true, I'd say that's an odd practice for a prize that you'd think would value the writing as much as everything else. Can anyone provide some insight into how these books are selected? I guess there is also the possibility it's something as simple as hype and expectation, where my mind is convinced a book that has won an award must be good, and then I'm let down when it's "just another book' instead of some total revelation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looking at the trailer of LISA, I'm not really sure if I'd like this.. but for $10, might as well try this out. 

Still not tried Undertale. It's one of those things where I know it's probably good, but because it's popular I wonder to myself "Is the hype justified?" I did this with Breaking Bad where I wouldn't watch it for the longest time, then I saw it and loved it. So I know I'll eventually give Undertale a chance.. just right now I'm wondering if it can really deserve the following or not.

As for Mother 3, yeah that one is obviously amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The stories of both these games, in their own ways, evoke this sense of whimsy and wonder that isn't immediately explained by "You are the chosen one! It is your destiny!" (I'm pretty sure both of these games have scenes where they're told this near the end, but that isn't the point) Chrono Trigger in particular is so fucking well done in its gradual unfolding of the plot: you don't even learn about Lavos until you've defeated three bosses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always loved Super Metroid since I was a kid, so it's a shame the Wrecked Ship is one of the most boring areas in a video game.

Despite how small it is, the place FEELS like it takes forever. You've got a boss in Phantoon who takes a while to kill, made worse by the fact he's pretty easy. The top floor that leads to an energy tank and the Gravity Suit is a long corridor that requires you to kill all the enemies within it twice, for no apparent reason. Then there's the chozo statue that takes foreeeever to walk down the stairs to the Gravity Suit itself.

I'd say its only highlight is the creepy music, which isn't enough on its own to save the annoying level design. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not the type to over-analyze the shit out of everything in a TV series, but surely the opening credits of a drama are meant to convey *something*. So I'm curious what people who have watched this show much longer than me (only on season 2) think about them.

To me, something mundane like driving around the city for all the credits and then pulling into his driveway, seems to symbolize how you don't know who a mobster is in your own life, that it could be your next door neighbor for all you know, that they're hidden in plain sight. Because you think most shows like this would highlight the mob part, but The Sopranos chooses not to do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Visual triggers are fool-proof. They work on any camera, as far as I've ever seen. 

Sound triggers, on the other hand, rely on having a better microphone. Whether it's Rode, Tascam, 3Dio, etc - you can't (or at least I can't) get triggered by a microphone that lacks binaural setup. 

It's admirable that these creators WANT to give you tingles, but it's just not good enough on crappy microphones that don't have a surround sound quality. Focusing on visual triggers would really play to their strengths instead of making me wish they had a better microphone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently, I tried to re-read The Westing Game because I remember I loved this book as a kid, particularly the word play.

And while that word play is indeed clever, I'd never realized this has such a messy beginning. There are around ten characters introduced in the first few chapters, all briefly mentioned and then bouncing off like an A.D.D. rabbit to the next one. 

This kind of thing is typically exhausting for me and I'm curious to hear what the rest of /r/books thinks about it. Do you like a lot of characters being introduced at the beginning of a book? Is it acceptable to have a large cast if they're introduced slowly or do you still prefer a smaller and intimate group of heroes and heroines? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thinking about giving Kindle Paperwhite a second chance - any help on finding GOOD books? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-10 22:53:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got one a few years ago, after hating the idea of ebooks for a long time. Turns out I was wrong, I loved reading on it and didn't see a need for paperbacks anymore. Well, that would have been the case... if I could find good books that weren't so expensive compared to paperbacks. So I returned the thing and went back to buying used books.

The problem, from what I remember, is those sites that email you deals and sales never recommend anything GOOD. I'm a bit of a snob who's into the classics like Faulkner and Woolf, then there's modern stuff like Gaiman and Stephenson, then stuff like Murakami, George Saunders, Jose Saramago, etc - stuff that is never on sale like that.

My best option seems to be finding a really good library that would have these - for example, I've heard the Greater Phoenix and Los Angeles libraries singled out by name as large ebook libraries that are worth the $50/year (assuming you don't live there.) Other than that, do these types of books ever go on sale?

Bonus Question: You can subscribe to stuff like newsletters and magazines and send them directly to your Kindle, right? I really like the idea of a periodical like this. Do they have good formatting or is the screen size small and awkward for what is typically a bigger magazine?

Bonus Question 2: has the formatting improved over the past few years? My one real complaint about the Paperwhite (other than the high price of books I'd actually want to read), is that there was a lot of    spacing    out     of       words instead of using hyphens. It looked so tacky and distracted me from reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me explain what I mean by this. For anyone who's seen Breaking Bad, I'm sure you're aware that part of the charm is how the drama can be peppered with some genuinely funny moments. Most anime seems to be completely serious or completely funny. Is there anything with a good middle ground, something that's mostly serious with some appropriate comic relief? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to like Dota, but it's got to the point that every match lasts an hour or more. I can't handle this. It's not even that I don't have time, but that it's boring.

I don't particular care what genre, as long as it's short. 20 minutes sounds like a *maximum* that I'd deal with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been told that mobas are really hard, but honestly after a year of playing Dota, all I can say is you right-click stuff until about 20 minutes, where it doesn't matter if you were behind or getting your ass kicked, items and levels can become a handicap to help you win despite your lack of skill.

Any first person shooter I've ever played, on the other hand, is much more about aim and map awareness. You can't cheese your way through those games: either you can play them or you cannot. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After a few weeks of playing, I've finally unlocked competitive matchmaking in Overwatch. It's fascinating to me how the rules are tweaked a bit to have a fair match compared to Quick Play.

That got me thinking a bit about Starcraft, where I'm still on the Starter Edition. I took to Google and apparently there aren't two separate queues for Starcraft, it's just that if you queue for ranked your rating can go up or down. So an unranked player can go up against a ranked player, is this true? I assume the game still tries to match skill levels despite this? Is there anything else I need to know about unranked vs ranked in Starcraft? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-02 21:05:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hacking the enemy *sounds* useful, but the fact that any damage interrupts the attempt makes her seem worthless. You think you'd go invis to make it easier, but as we all know, she announces her presence as soon as she comes out of invis. And the logic is to get a pick-off 1 vs 1, but when the enemy is always bunched up together, that's impossible because they'll attack you, yet again interrupting your hack.

So what are you supposed to do? I don't get it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are quite a few weird scenes that don't seem to gel with the mood of the show or at least don't seem to make any sense. There's Gordon finding that dead guy electrocuted in the rain or whatever, then in the next episode he's digging a huge hole in his backyard. There's Joe smashing a car, Joe breaking his window with a baseball bat, Joe pointing flashlights up at the sky... I'd say Cameron and Bosworth are actually the least bizarre characters in the show right now.

Is this a problem that persists in season two? Does the show ever learn what subtlety is? I really want to like this show, but it's a little bit over-the-top for what it is. </TEXT>

<TITLE> When should I choose Mercy instead of Zenyatta? What can she do that he can't? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-02 05:54:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been playing the game for about a month now. Support characters have always been my "thing" in video games, and having played TF2 in the past, naturally Mercy appealed to me because of her resemblance to the Medic. 

But after playing with Zenyatta over the past week, I'm not really sure why I'd choose Mercy. Right now, it's looking like the only thing she can do is the fun as hell Guardian Angel ability. 

Her right-click damage boost doesn't seem to do much, whether because my teammates refuse to shoot the enemy or because they DO shoot the enemy and you can barely tell a difference. Orb of Discord seems like a simply better version of this.

Then you've got her heal, where she can't fight back without breaking off the heal. Meanwhile, both of Zenyatta's orbs allow him to attack. 

Yeah, she's got the useful Resurrection ult... but other than that, I'm not seeing why you'd choose her over Zenyatta. He can heal, increase damage an enemy takes, AND attack, all three at the same time. Mercy can only ever do one of those at a time. And it feels like if you *do* ever use her damage boost, that your teammate will surely die because the damage dealers in this game are rather squishy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've watched three and a half seasons of Mad Men. While I liked some of the episodes a lot (The Suitcase is as good as everyone says it is), it's never been interesting to make me want to binge watch it. Of course, binge watching something isn't required to enjoy something.. but.. you should at least have that anticipation, "I can't wait to see what happens next." Especially after The Suitcase, I feel like.. you know, that's already some good closure and I'm kinda bored now. I'm a few episodes after that one now, but just lost interest. When you start browsing reddit during a TV show, I think that's a signal that you should move on to something else.

Anyhow, yeah this is a lot of deliberation about something ultimately silly. Does anyone else feel this way, like, "maybe I have bad taste if I don't like something everyone says is great"? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I switched from Dota to OW thinking I'd be ok with dealing with people's bullshit - surprise, it's just as annoying in a different game. Granted, it's not nearly as common in OW (at least in Quick Play?) but I don't have time to listen to *anyone's* whining. Is there a way to just mute everything forever until I decide to turn it back on? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Among the basic concepts of Dota that aren't mentioned in the tutorial: denying, pulling, and stacking. There are other concepts that need to be addressed, too, but we need to start somewhere. It's actually a little insane that players at low MMR don't even know about these mechanics because the game doesn't tell anyone. Using outside resources to learn how to play a game isn't okay.

edit: How the fuck is anyone downvoting this? You DON'T want new players to have more information available to them? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading about this game's features over the years, I've always been a bit intrigued. But every time I consider buying it, I hesitate because of the open world. A big reason I prefer story-less roguelikes such as Brogue is that I don't enjoy the idea of hitting up the same NPCs over and over and over and over, which is something you WILL do in a genre where death comes early and often. Do they have the same lines every time or is the story also randomly generated to keep it interesting? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've tried the series multiple times over the years because the concept *sounds* interesting. In practice, I feel like the mechanics are a jumbled mess. If it were only military or only culture, I'd be having a blast. But I've never been able to grasp how the two interconnect, when to focus on one and when to focus on the other.

As an example, I've always wanted to attempt running a civ as peacefully as possible, just spreading my culture throughout - however, I'm not sure that's actually possible. I know I should probably have a balance of the two, but again I'm not really sure how to do that.

Honestly, I'm wondering if I should give it up and just take up two separate series that represent what Civ tries to accomplish. I could play Age of Wonders 3 for the combat and .. I guess Tropico or something for the culture because city builders like that don't seem common anymore. Unless someone could give me some insight here, or am I overcomplicating things? </TEXT>

I decided to mention this on the game's subreddit and someone got mad about it, said "do not EVER mention cheating here again." I don't understand why it even matters in a single player game how you go about unlocking content as long as you enjoy yourself.

The damage dealers in this game are so fragile, which I know is a way to balance out how mobile they are, but still...

I've not played an FPS in quite a while, so my aim is also bad. I've found I really like Mercy because you don't necessarily need great aim most of the time, just good decision making. There are a few other heroes I like, too, but mostly Mercy. Is there anything "wrong" with just playing the same hero over and over? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now, I'm usually fine with a slow burn. My favorite scenes in Breaking Bad were the slower ones like when Walt was talking to Crazy Eight in Jesse's basement. But there was also real conflict behind that. Better Call Saul doesn't really seem to have much moral dilemma. Maybe there would be if I didn't know about Saul's future, but I do. There's no "will he or won't he?" We know he's going to be a shady crook. 

So I mean.. as much as I want to like this  - the cinematography really is as fantastic as you'd expect from the people who did Breaking Bad - the story just seems inconsequential. I find it hard to believe this Sandpiper case is why Jimmy becomes Saul.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not doing anything to help by upvoting all these threads about LPQ to the front page. In fact, I have this theory that LP is working just as intended. Dota is such an addictive game, and they know this, so they want you to have even more of an incentive to be addicted. If you get in LP and somehow have the misfortune to stay there for a while, you're playing right into their hand. That's a guaranteed five games that you're playing for Valve. The longer you stay in their player base, the more likely you are to buy their cosmetics. And really, as long as you do that, they don't give a fuck about fixing the game.

Do you know the easiest way to fix this? Uninstall Dota. Vote with your wallet, so to speak. Show Valve you've had enough of their shit, and just uninstall. If enough people leave (and I'm sure quite a few people have already left for other reasons, whether due to Peruvians or disliking 7.00 changes or whatever), they'll be forced to take action. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For example, in Dota I like to a-click the mini-map, then check up on what items my teammates/enemies have and their location/health/etc. There aren't any items in Starcraft, but is this something that can be applied in the game? Or would I be too busy with production at any give time? 

Is there anything in the options menu that I should really have turned on or off, for a quality-of-life kinda thing? As an example, "Select All Larvae" seems like a good idea and is enabled by default - is there any reason I'd want to disable it?

A more general question: how often is SC2 patched, does Blizzard still support it, or have they quietly abandoned it in favor of Overwatch/Heroes of the Storm/Hearthstone? I've never seen any such accusations, but I have a hunch this may have happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've not played this game in a while and thought I'd give it another go. One thing I remember always struggling with a bit is using two keys at once to use items or spells. I'm pretty sure you can remap them to a single key press, so I think I'd just use something simple like keys 1-6.

Is there any reason I shouldn't do this? Does doing the two-key thing keep you more in rhythm with the music or is it all personal preference? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey /u/DerrickCreamer

Typically I wouldn't ask something like this and just assume either a game is finished and/or on hiatus, but the Rogue Basin page does mention this:

*Future Plans: Between 0.8.5 and 0.9.0 - Even more variety in monsters, with certain dungeon features being associated with specific monsters. 'Minibosses' and other leader monsters. More activated abilities.*

Is this still in the works or has the game been put on hold, whether temporarily (well I guess that one is obvious) or permanently? Thanks. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Antibirth has its new floors inaccessible if you're unlucky. You can't enter Downpour without a key, can't enter Mines without two bombs, etc.

So I was thinking, you know, the alternate floors in the original Rebirth are harder than their counterpart and the chance that they can randomly spawn as your first floor doesn't seem logical to me. Why not make it so it's unlocked only if you didn't take any damage on the first floor of a chapter? Would anyone like that idea? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something I loved about this game and haven't found too often in other games is the interactivity of the maps and what they can mean for the gameplay. You've got a level where the screen is scrolling up and you're kinda platforming while you're fighting; you've got one where submarines dive and resurface and dive down again, each one with different weapons and gimmicks; you've got a level set in the air where you can knock your opponent off the edge. I'm pretty sure I remember a level where you're also platforming to dodge obstacles before you get to a final arena.

I think Smash Bros does this a bit, but is there anything else? Doesn't necessarily have to be a fighting game, either.

<TEXT> Like, are people dicks in quick play? Part of the reason I'm taking a break from Dota is people will yell at you for being bad *in unranked queue*. I'll typically play support, but sometimes I just want to carry, you know, just for fun. (imagine that, fun in a video game) I'm not sure why anyone cares so much when it's not even the competitive game mode. 

And with a brand new game like Overwatch, I'm going to want to experiment with all 23 heroes for a while to see which ones are my favorite. Yes, I'll probably gravitate towards support heroes like Mercy and Lucio because that's just who I am - but obviously I need to know what everyone else does, too. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been researching a bit about this game for the past few days because, let's be honest, $40 is a serious investment after playing exclusively Dota 2 for the past year. I don't want to throw money at something blindly. For the most part I'm *pretty sure* I want to buy this game, but there's one more question.

I know this one is a little biased because you're all on this subreddit and will probably respond positively but I'll ask anyhow. How replayable would you say the maps are in Overwatch? The most fun part of any shooter is that the maps stay the same (obviously) and a million different situations arise within that map because of different players. Is the fun mostly in the 23 different heroes and how they counter each other or is the map architecture just as exciting as the gunplay?

I don't know if that was clear, sorry. Hopefully someone can make sense of it. :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I could never really enjoy Torchlight much because, when I first started playing it, I was new to PC gaming and all the different abilities and hotkeys (10 of them!) really blew my mind. Then I got addicted to Dota where, despite how many keys you can potentially use, there are really only six abilities at max, four for most heroes.

So this got me thinking back to Torchlight. Is it at all efficient to make a build that's only like 4 to 6 active skills and have everything else be a passive? That would really strike the perfect balance for me, but I'm not sure if it would screw me over in the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to love Dota and now I stress out playing it, mostly because of the toxic player base. I know I can mute all chat, and often that's what I do, but then I'll unmute every now and then with the hopes finally I'll get some mature teammates... nope, doesn't happen, whether I'm playing ranked or unranked. All I want is a game where people actually want to communicate instead of playing the blame game *before the runes even spawn*. 

Should I just keep muting all chat? Should I auto-mute everyone on the enemy team? Should I give everyone "a chance" and mute them only if they say something? Though usually I get tilted from the first comment and the game is already ruined because I try to argue back with them. 

Is it too much to ask to have teammates who acknowledge they suck? I know I suck and I'm fine with that. I'm sick of my mid or carry giving tons of reasons why we lost, even though they played just as badly as me. And this is even in unranked, there is no escape from the whining just by "not playing ranked".

Sorry this is mostly whining but - surely there is some solution here?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I was looking through [this post on the Steam TF2 discussion board](https://steamcommunity.com/app/440/discussions/0/364040797996275899) where someone lists what they believe to be the pros and cons of each game, and then in the cons of Overwatch, this is written: *meta team comps, I have noticed if a team has chosen all the highest tier heroes the team becomes impossible to break down, think 12 engineers on turbine levels of defence with no uber available, I have studied tier lists and discussions and conclude that indeed a comp of certain heroes can beat any other team and this is a major downfall as it stops people playing a hero that they enjoy over a hero that will win.*

Now, this is from May 2016. So it's possible they were right and now this has been balanced. Or is this still true? Or was it never true in the first place?

There's also this one: *has a growing amount of hackers in game and with no vote kick there is no way to remove cheaters from your game.* Are hackers still an issue, did Blizzard do anything to combat them?

<TEXT> I've not played TF2 for about half a year. I quit mostly because the game was pretty laggy, for some reason, not because I didn't like it.

K, so I tried out the Paladins beta and thought it was cheap and unpolished - despite that, the basic premise piqued my interest to try out Overwatch. The thing is it's $60 and that's a lot of money these days when I play free games like Dota and TF2.

As much as I like Dota, CSGO, TF, I'd love to see something new from them. L4D3 is probably the most logical step (or maybe a TF3 to compete with Overwatch), but what I'd really like is a genre they've never done before.

I'm not sure what that would be. My biggest hope would be turn-based strategy game kinda like Advance Wars or Chess. Maybe their take on a card game. Maybe an entirely new kind of game with their VR tech. All I know is I'm itching to see what creative new ideas they might have. </TEXT>

Apparently he reported me and I'm now in low priority. Cool. I think the lesson I've learned is to mute all chat and to keep it that way.

<TITLE> What is a support meant to do in the early game of League? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-06 17:38:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> OK, my third post in 24 hours. Sorry. :x

This is probably the deciding factor on if I'll keep playing League or not. The thing I love most about playing support in Dota is the ability to use TP scrolls to turn around tower diving ganks. Just as the enemy thinks they've got the kill, I'll swoop in and save my carry from death AND possibly kill the enemy. 

League, as far as I know, doesn't have the ability to teleport consistently to a tower. There's the summoner spell that lets you do it every 300 seconds... but that's not nearly often enough to help out other lanes.

So, I suspect that there is a different early game meta for supports in League. What is it? What am I supposed to do, is it really just babysitting my carry and that's it, or is there opportunity to roam and gank? Even the concept of warding seems different in this game since everyone gets them for free and they last only a minute. (Then there's the fact there are like six or seven different types of wards.. makes my head spin, I'm a little confused.) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now that I'm more seriously considering making League a side game in addition to Dota, I'd really like some guides to make things less of a headache. If I hadn't had /u/tortedelini and his fantastic guides when I started playing Dota last year, I'd have probably not lasted even a week. Now that I'm starting a new game, I'm similarly intimidated without some guidance. Or are Riot's default item builds better than Valve's? (though that still leaves me with the question of skill build)

For example, I tried playing Sona last night and I REALLY didn't feel like I had any impact. I feel part of this is the skill build, because I didn't know what the hell to level up. And then there's the fact that I don't have any runes/masteries because I'm new: how important are those things, really?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I'm a Dota player trying out League. I'm still a bit confused about a lot of this, particularly the jungle and how it seems so cute and cuddly. There's this sweet little frog moving around and I want to pet him.

But anyhow, I've not even hit ranked yet. I hear about how you MUST lock in a role. This probably isn't super important for me because I like to play support, but like.. how does this work? What if there were two people on the team already who chose support? Does that mean I have to pick a carry now, no questions asked? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can anyone who's played Dota help me figure out which League heroes I'd like to play? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-05 19:48:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm toying with the idea of picking up League as a side game. The reason I've avoided it, mostly, is because I don't like that most heroes require to pay for them. So maybe someone can help me out here. 

In Dota, there aren't many heroes I play regularly. Mostly supports, I'm all about early game domination and roaming. I love Vengeful Spirit, Crystal Maiden, Ogre Magi, Treant Protector, and, to a lesser extent, Jakiro, Witch Doctor, and Riki.

In broader terms, I like heroes who can save cores and/or catch the enemy out of position and punish them for it (Venge's swap is my favorite skill in the game for this reason) </TEXT>

Do the expansions make the game more fun in that regard, or are the enemies still bullet sponges that feel like they take forever to kill, where it feels like it only takes time to kill them instead of skill? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I played League for a couple hours and got kinda bored, so I uninstalled. Since I didn't play much, there's one concept that's always been kinda fuzzy for me. As far as I can tell, every champion has their own innate skill that is always active from level one. Is this correct? For example, Nami has this one: "All allied champions touched by any of Nami's abilities gain 60 (+ 20% AP) bonus movement speed for 1.5 seconds." 

Is that something you need to level up or is it indeed always active? If it's the latter, I think that's the coolest shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been playing with quickcast almost as soon as I started playing Dota, not necessarily to get better but because normal cast always seemed awkward to me.

Now that I've started playing a bit of Techies, I find that I'm shit at knowing where to place prox mines unless I turn on the ability range finder. And I've noticed even for my favorite heroes, it's nice to see the EXACT aoe on stuff like CM's Crystal Nova. So I'm curious, does the moment where the range finder appears make the spell take a longer time to cast? It probably doesn't, but I swear it feels like it does. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need help making my hero small yet diverse </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-01 00:12:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've tried this once before and then tried to diversify again.. and yeah.. I feel like playing too many heroes just stresses me out too much making me think "this hero counters that one, but this one synergizes more with my team, and blah blah blah." I know these are important things to consider, but generally at 1.5k mmr there are other *more important* things like positioning and item choices.

OK, so there are three heroes I know for a fact I'll choose to be part of my pool: **Ogre Magi, Treant Protector, and Vengeful Spirit**. These three have been my favorites ever since I started playing the game a year ago, and I don't see that changing any time soon.

* Venge - Fantastic at taking people out of position, great at reducing armor and the aura is great
* Treant - the tower healing usually lets us stall their pushes and gives us map control for a long time, also he's great at rushing a gem and countering people like Mirana and Riki (especially in 7.00)
* Ogre - tbh ... I'm not sure what he's "good for" other than the RNG on his ult being funny, though I do like to pick him when there is someone like a Sniper or Tiny on my team so the Bloodlust machine can be even more helpful

After those three, I'm a little unsure. Crystal Maiden is probably also definitely going to be included because my win rate with her has always been around 60%. 

I would love to practice more Abaddon for the heal/purge/slow that he provides, but I'm hesitant about melee for solo supporting (I realize Ogre and Treant are melee, but they're also either a. tanky as fuck or b. hit like a truck)

That leaves the following heroes: Bane, Dazzle, Jakiro, Lina, Rubick, Shadow Shaman, Silencer, Skywrath Mage, Undying, Venomancer, Witch Doctor

Which of these heroes overlap a bit too much and I could throw out? Which one of them are just bad at solo supporting? Basically what would be the smallest group that potentially counters the most lineups? (example, Dazzle and Venge really seem to serve similar purposes to me, same for CM and Jakiro - but I could be entirely wrong so please help me if you can)

And are there any other supports that would be decent at solo supporting that I might want to reconsider? Lion and Lich bore me, btw

Also when it comes to the rare case that there are already two supports on my team, I tend to go with Faceless Void in either offlane or safelane or Death Prophet mid </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd say 8 times out of 10, when I look at the post-game scoreboard, I'm the only one who's bought wards on either side. So I don't really know how to deward because it's never been an issue. Lately, I've been running into people who will deward and it's so frustrating.

Sentries seem like a waste of money because it's 200 gold and you might not even find anything. How am I supposed to have any idea where they warded? Personally, I like to ward behind the towers that I want my team to take in the near future. But how am I supposed to know that's what THEY'RE doing? If I try to deward where makes sense, it's just as likely I've wasted money.

Is there some trick to doing this or is it just an annoying part of the game I need to deal with? If this were just the eye spot high ground wards, I wouldn't be so pissed off and I'd realize I need to find better spots that don't get dewarded. The thing is I've also been getting dewarded at spots that baffle me that they'd even put a sentry there, leading me to believe I'm dealing with a smurf or map hacker or something. </TEXT>

I remember hearing a few people say a lot more heroes would build a Midas in this patch to get talents more quickly. I don't think I've ever actually built a Midas on any hero.. ever. The typical advice I've always heard about it is "Build one if you know the game is going to go late", which is worthless to me because I never know when games are going to "go late." Maybe that's every game for me since they're often 40-60 minutes long?

If I do build one, should it be my first item after boots? Or am I usually better off getting the typical support-y things like force staff/medallion/glimmer/etc? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Treant Aghs: core or situational? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-29 22:50:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For as much as I've played Treant in the past year, I could probably count on one hand the number of times I've bought this thing. Part of it is due to the fear they'll end up countering me with a mere 1100 gold (gem and quelling blade) in comparison to the 4200 gold that I spent to get one.

But that's no longer my only concern. I feel like Treant is versatile enough that you can either stack him with auras or disables (Atos, Euls, etc) and he'll be just as useful in different ways. Personally, I don't see the point of an Aghs unless your enemy has some highly elusive heroes like Tinker, Ember, AM, Monkey, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe I'm playing him wrong, but I see a support Riki about roaming the map, being a pesk, getting vision. The problem with this is basically everyone else in the game is a roamer at this low bracket, everyone is CONSTANTLY chasing for kills. And when I've got a gem trying to counter a Treant and an Invoker at the same time, I can't be that risky. My team never pushes when I play him, so is he really worth it when all my t2 towers are down and the enemy t1 towers are still standing?

<TEXT> For example, there are quite a few people who don't spend their 625 gold in the pre-game. I don't understand this.

Also, there seem to be a lot of people who don't understand heroes have been reworked, most notably Techies. Those who play Techies will sometimes still put mines in the river, not understanding you can now see them at all times. Those who play *against* Techies will sometimes buy sentries in the laning phase, not seeming to know that's now a waste of gold unless he's got remote mines or stasis traps set up.

Really, the front page should have had bullet points that listed major changes instead of highlighting ONLY Monkey King. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I loved Treant when I first started a year ago, thought the ability to heal towers and teammates across the map was so cool. Typically I'll just stop tower pushes and give us more space to farm, because we'll have more map control than the enemy. This was admittedly a bit too passive, just a gamble that my teammates would get some farm and win the game.

Now with the new bash out of invis, I've become even more passive with him. I'm scared to even come out of the trees because I'm thinking his full potential isn't being used if I don't use the bash. Is this the wrong approach? I mean, with most supports I'll roam around the map looking for kills or harassing them a lot, but with Treant I'm always afraid to do it in this new patch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Considering the damage reduction and movement speed buff on Ghost Ship (and especially now with shrines, you can take a fight and heal up after rum wears off, if you take the fight near one, instead of running back to base), can you cast this on your team pre-emptively before an engagement, or is the 10 second duration too short to really do much? I guess it would also depend how many other stuns there are on your team and if you need to initiate or not.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-12-20 00:08:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm a 1k retard, always wanting to see which heroes can potentially be played as support. Support CK is fun as fuck, he's good at roaming around for unexpected ganks. Naga Siren, tried her... she doesn't really seem to work as a solo support, so I ditched her.

But what about Drow? She's got a silence, a slow, an aura that increases ranged damage of your teammates - and if she builds for a Rod of Atos, she's got a root. She's squishy, but most supports are squishy anyhow. Would this work out at all? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've played this game for a year and tbh I'm still confused about the purpose of her ult. To my understanding, it's disabled around enemy heroes. So she's got an ult specifically designed around split pushing and avoiding the enemy? Then how does she do so much damage to heroes, is it the Precision Aura alone? '

edit: And while I'm on the subject of Drow, when is the best time to use the active ability of Precision Aura?  </TEXT>

And now that the map has changed and his invis has turned into a passive, he's been the easiest way for me to learn the jungle camps and juke paths in betwen the trees. Twice now, Treant has taught me how to play this game.

Have the lanes reversed themselves? Or perhaps does it not even matter much in this patch who goes to the side lanes due to the bounty runes and larger jungles? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd always liked the idea of Techies as this role, but wasn't entirely sure if it were possible. You were kind of encouraged to plant mines all in one place. Now that you can't really do this nearly as much, what is stopping him from nuking down entire creep waves, or being on the back lines to silence everyone with Blast Off? I feel like the only reason he'd still plant mines all across the map is with Remote Mines and that doesn't happen at level 6.

Or maybe I'm entirely wrong. He's still fairly squishy, though can't he itemize around that to an extent? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-12-13 12:41:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I play support 95% of the time so I should be happy about these changes, and I am for the most part, but I can't help but feel supports are getting buffed and carries are arguably being nerfed.

Supports have four different bounty runes to take, tomes now scale with each use, some talents give respawn reduction, and as a whole they give much less gold than a carry upon death because of the rework to that formula including net worth.

Then carries seem to be nerfed because jungle camps spawn only every two minutes and in general kills give less, not just for supports. 

Do carries need a buff to offset all the perks supports have been given? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For example, when I was ahead and rich as a support, and slot starved, I'd often build Boots of Travel so I could still have both TPs and wards. With this new backpack, I won't be wasting all that gold because I can keep TPs on hand at all times. Granted, I don't think I should have ever been building BoTs as a support anyhow in most cases - but hey, that's why I'm only 1.5k mmr.

Keeping something like an Aether Lens recipe on hand is also incredibly handy so I don't need to fly out the courier, that way carries can use it. But with the backpack, maybe the courier won't be used as much in the first place. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I can't think of a better way to word that question. Basically, I'm curious how many people watch DBZA solely for TFS's great writing instead of as another way to rewatch DBZ. These days I try to rewatch DBZ and I cringe at how bad it is. Of the anime I watched as a kid, it's easily aged the worst. I'd rather watch Sailor Moon or Yu Yu Hakusho if I want a nostalgia fix.

Are a lot of people watching just because they dislike DBZ and want to see how they make fun of it? I know TFS genuinely enjoys DBZ (or I'd assume they would with how long it takes to edit these), but surely I can't be the only one who doesn't like the original anymore. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I played a bit of Rebirth back when it first released and didn't like it much. The appeal of the original flash game, for me, was the hilarious ways you could become OP. This was still possible in Rebirth, occasionally, but I feel like most of the new items in Rebirth were intentionally bad, like the game was daring you to pick them up to make the game harder. 

Does Afterbirth change this item drop balance so the good and bad items are equally likely to appear? And are the items from Afterbirth fun in themselves or also as tedious as those from Rebirth? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pros do this a bit. And I've come to the conclusion some things they do just cannot translate to pub games where you have no trust or knowledge of your teammates (level 8 support at 26 minutes into the game, for example.. uh no.)

Holding on to gold until you're sure which item you need to buy seems like one of the few things that might be worth copying from the pro players. Would you agree or disagree? Or should you have a game plan right from the beginning, "the enemy has this hero, so I should build this item"? Should you hold on to gold even if you do have a plan? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-12-07 23:38:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For me, I've never liked a drummer who throws in flashy fills in an attempt to overpower the other instruments. I've never really liked guitar solos much either, for that matter, but that's not the point. More than any other instrument, I feel a drummer needs to be restrained yet not boring.

I'd say Stella Mozgawa from Warpaint is one of the better examples of this. Her beats are all a joy to hear and she's never making an attempt to bust out into an annoying solo. She's holding the song together, just as a drummer should do. [Here's one of my favorite examples.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISwQavXuMhA)

<TITLE> When do I buy boots/wind lace immediately and when can I delay buying them? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-07 21:42:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm watching the EG vs Wings game right now, and I'm seeing something new to me. iceice on Dazzle got raindrops first and didn't get wind lace, got brown boots instead around 10 minutes.  

I'd heard that wind lace is the thing to get first on supports ever since its introduction. When do you skip it and go straight to boots? When can you skip boots entirely for a while? Dazzle is a good example of where I think this might be acceptable because 305 is a respectably high starting movement speed. 

And alternatively, when do you buy boots/wind lace immediately? I see people do this sometimes, whether in my games or pro games, and it seems risky to me when you could have regen instead.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZzrBWhG4o](In this Terrorblade coaching video), he makes a point that a side pull is better because it's easier and because it benefits your carry more.

<TEXT> And I guess another question is *how* would I do such a thing, since a lot of people in my bracket don't seem to understand they need to stay near trees to stay invisible. Should I get on mic and tell them to stay there until the enemy gets closer to us or would that be too demanding? Is it best used as an escape or an initiation? If I use it too often, will the enemy start buying detection against me? I know when there's a Treant on the other team that I rarely think to buy sentries since he's "just a support", so maybe other people think the same way and won't counter me.

I have to wonder, though, does this really work in practice? Look at heroes like Clinkz and BH whose movement speed increases while invis. Yes, dust slows them down, but is it by enough? Is this combo really effective against anyone other than a Mirana? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Which comedians do you consider endearing when they laugh at their own material? </TITLE>

<TEXT> This is often considered a bad thing, right? And usually I'd agree. But there are certain comedians who can do it (whether it's forced or real, I can't ever tell because I'm not a comedian myself, just a fan) that are all the more charming because of it.

One of them I'd consider Dave Chappelle (please don't kill me, I know the sidebar says he's low-effort but this is a discussion about many comics). Which other comedians do you think can laugh at their own stuff and not make you want to roll your eyes? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there such a thing as tactical feeding? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-23 22:27:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is partly venting, partly curiosity. I had a Slark in my game who died 19 times. He thought his feeding was justified because he said something like "look at those idiots, wasting all their ults on me." He seemed to think he was helping our team by having the enemy use all their ults only on one hero.

Is this actually a thing? I'd always thought feeding was ...bad. The only hero I can think of who might benefit from dying is Venge or a Bloodstone carrier, maaaaaybe Shadow Fiend or Venomancer in some scenarios. And even in those situations, wouldn't you prefer to live? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has happened to me multiple times. I'll say "I'm going to support" and they'll even say "OK thanks a lot" and then there's two in the offlane and one in the jungle .. and I'm trying to stay alive against a dual offlane. It's like these people WANT to lose. Why would anyone do this? Is there an honest-to-god reason someone would do this, or is this an example of an unwinnable (or very difficult game)? Or do I just suck? Some people have told me I should really know how to 1 v 2 as a support, but that seems crazy to me. A support is not an offlaner.

edit: [I made the same thread on /r/dota2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5e7lpi/why_do_people_think_its_acceptable_to_leave_a) and someone told me "It's not only acceptable but is also recommended". Am I being trolled? I'm so confused.

<TEXT> I've been using this for a long time and while it's what I'm used to, something about it feels off to me. But since I've never really used edge panning very often, that also feels awkward. Basically my problem is too often I'll camera grip all the way across the screen instead of clicking on the minimap to see what's happening much quicker. 

I know everything is mostly personal preference, but what do you consider the quickest way to move the camera? How often should I be clicking the minimap instead of panning/gripping? I feel like there are a lot of finer points to camera movement that are never discussed and I'd like a little commentary on it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't actually get it often, but now that I think about it, there are quite a few scenarios where it makes sense to buy. For example, I've always liked the idea of using it with a hero that's already got a slow (Ogre, CM, maybe even Kunkka) to slow the enemy even more, effectively stunning them. Also, I have this idea that it could be a situationally good pick-up on Venge after you swap a tanky hero into a group of melee teammates so they can get a lot more right clicks.

But most people say it needs a buff. Is Rod of Atos truly useless in its current state? How can/should it be used? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the longest time, I'd put one right next to enemy mid tower and then one as close to enemy offlane tower as I could. No one has ever dewarded me and I don't expect them to do so any time soon. But I know if I'm ever going to climb MMR that they'll deward this, simply because you can easily see the hero on the minimap when they place these wards. I didn't even know this until I decided to look at a replay from the enemy perspective, and there I was, clear as day walking up to their mid tower.

So how do I ward mid without being caught? Or should I even ward mid at all? Should I be constantly checking the map myself instead of looking at the minimap to know if the enemy mid is missing or at low health? </TEXT>

Of course, you should also look at the minimap to see how many heroes are currently visible. If you see like 3 heroes who are all the way on the other end of the map, you're probably safe. I'm convinced this is one of those small things that's been winning me games lately, so I'd say try it out and see what happens.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My sister (21) doesn't read, and so she rarely if ever reads to her children, a set of 2 year old twins. She sits them in front of the TV, either her own shows or children's shows. I know they're not that old, yet I feel like they should know more words than "no", "hey guy", and ... I'm struggling to think of other words they know, honestly. I don't think this is normal.

And this is one of the reasons I don't want kids. It's scary that you are the reason your kids are fucked up. If I had kids, I'd try my hardest, sure. But there's still the lingering thought: what if I fail them? (Though I seriously doubt this even crosses my sister's mind... she doesn't read, so why would she be worried that her kids aren't being exposed to it? She doesn't understand the importance and I don't see a scenario where she'd regret it.) </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-12 23:36:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> * Should I build items to counter heroes based on what I THINK they'll do? An example, I had an enemy Mirana. I was like, ok, I'll build a Pipe of Insight to mitigate some of the Aghs damage. But she goes for Manta and Maelstrom and I was like... oh, I guess I wasted gold. This happens every now and then with other heroes, too. And I know I should be checking their items, and I did, but I was expecting the Aghs to come eventually.

* Is it generally ok to buy a gem right after boots? I've been told by a friend that this only works at low MMR. I don't quite understand why. I know part of it is at low MMR the invis heroes are incredibly reckless and I assume they'll become less so as I go against better players. But surely a gem is still useful?

* Let's say I'm in safe lane and my carry refuses to farm against the dual offlane, just sits there and soaks up exp like they're an offlaner. Should I continue to try to babysit them or should I start roaming to mid or wherever? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's an example. I'm Vengeful Spirit. I have Tranq Boots, Solar Crest, Orchid Malevolence, TP scrolls, Aether Lens, and Magic Wand. The problem here is I no longer have room for wards. Thankfully, in this was the rare game where I had a second support with me and she warded a lot of the time.  

But in a normal game where that's not going to happen, is it okay to sell the wand to make room for another slot as long as you have enough health/mana regen through your items? I do this quite often and don't see a HUGE problem with it, so I'd like to know if it's a good or bad move. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just had a game where I did excellent as CM in the early game, no deaths at all. Caught Riki every time with sentries, as well as the Sniper who decided to get a Shadow Blade despite seeing I was controlling Riki. But things didn't last. One time I had to go back to base because I was almost dead, and when that happened and I wasn't saving their asses with detection... they immediately started feeding Riki and things got out of control.

This is the sort of thing that makes me rage and sends me to low priority. I'm sincerely confused how people don't understand that they need to be cautious around invis heroes. Not like any of them were six slotted, I could at least understand that. It's as simple as no one at my skill level wants to buy detection other than me - and if I leave for one second, they are all dead. Every time.

Is there any hope to win games like these? If your teammates are feeders to invis heroes, can you somehow play around their stupidity to win the game? </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do you avoid getting put in low priority? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I made a new account, because my old account was on low priority and I wanted a better behavior score. I've won 7 games in a row and yet I am now in low priority. It's not for trash talking because you're not allowed to speak for the first 20 games on a new account. It's not for feeding or trolling. I tried my best, as I said I won the games and usually had the highest kills and lowest deaths.

My only theory is maybe the spam pinging when I told people to get back to safety made people annoyed and reported me, because I'm also on a communication ban. But when that is literally my only option because I can't talk for the first 20 games... Idk, this shit is fucked up.
 
So ... does low priority carry over between an IP address or something? I don't fucking understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't even understand the idea of not letting me communicate for the first 20 games. It is SO painful seeing something like a Death Prophet slowly trying to take down a tower with autoattacks. Why the fuck can't I tell her "Your ult is really good at taking down towers, you should use it right now"??? That's just one example.

How is this a welcoming environment for newbies, to have them lost and confused? There are people who have been playing for a while who can give them minor tips to help them out. I mean, in my experience as long as a player says "I'm new go easy on me" in unranked, people WILL help them. Or would have, in the past. 

Why are we no longer able to do this? If not for understanding strangers when I started, I'd probably have quit pretty soon because the game can be so overwhelming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One example of many is I like to play a lot of Crystal Maiden. Because I am a slave to guides, I'll get an Urn and a Blink after boots. So, let's say on the enemy team there is an Axe. Do I build the Eul's immediately after boots? Or do I still build something smaller like an Urn before? Or is a positioning item so important, even in the face of a hero who is dominating your team because they keep clumping up together, that you should get the Blink even before Eul's?

And like I said, Axe is just one example. In general, when should I build a counter item, especially as a support who isn't going to get as much gold as a carry throughout the game? </TEXT>

In fact, I'm convinced that if this were a short season like before Netflix acquired the series, that it wouldn't have made the cut.

So - a thought experiment. Which three episodes for you? Personally I'm not sure other than that Men Against Fire wouldn't be here and that San Junipero would definitely be one of the three. I'm also tempted to say Nosedive is a little too similar to Fifteen Million Merits and that, if necessary, despite being a good episode, that one would also be axed. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was younger, I used to always think bigger was better. Longer songs, longer books, longer movies. I mean, hey it's more content and you don't want a good thing to end, right?

But I've become convinced that I'd rather have something short and dense that rewards a second reading/viewing/playing. For books in particular, this is anywhere from 200 to 400 pages, though I'd have to say 300 is the magic number. 

Much longer than that, and you need a VERY good reason to justify the extra pages. More often than not, a long 600+ page book gives to me the impression that the writer had so many ideas and couldn't choose the best one, and it shows because the subplots tend to be weaker and inconsequential. </TEXT>

When I tried to read it a second time, the only part I enjoyed was The Navidson Record, the faux-academic paper *about* the house. Johnny Truant's bits made me want to gag, as did the typography silliness.

Based on that experience and a few others like it, I'm afraid to read what I considered favorites from high school. Particularly Albert Camus's The Plague and Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. Reading those for the first time, I loved every second of them. But what if I hate them now? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd always thought the answer to this question was "Yes, absolutely." But okay... I'm playing Lifestealer, right? And no one else is buying detection against a Riki. After a while Medusa starts calling me out, says "How do you have only an Armlet and Boots?" And I tell her, well, no one else is going to buy this shit, so I'm sacrificing myself to win. She says "You picked carry, so fucking play carry and farm. If you wanted to support, you should have picked support."

I'm baffled at this opinion, honestly. Many people at this MMR truly believe you'll get lucky with a stun or something and kill an invis hero without detection. They don't want to buy it even if they have the gold and the empty slots. And when it IS bought, they'll whine that the person buying it doesn't have items. Sub-1k MMR is goddamned insane.

<DATE> 2016-10-29 22:07:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To me, so many long books seem like a case of poor editing. When there could have been 5 words, the author decided to use 50, and the editor (was there one?) decided the redundancy was acceptable.

Prime offenders for me are Harry Potter's Order of the Phoenix and Middlemarch. With the Harry Potter, I ended up quitting the series because of it. Too much seemed inconsequential either to plot or character. And with Middlemarch, I feel like the book might have been long simply because it was a soap opera or "TV miniseries" of its time, if you will. 

But as for long books that felt like they had no filler... I can't think of one. As much as I wanted to love Don Quixote, I feel like it would have been better as a novella, because it became VERY repetitive.  </TEXT>

But if I see a good Tinker, someone who's clearly good with not getting caught out, shift-queueing, and farming - my brain just turns off and I want to cry. 

I know of "Tinker wards" but this seems like a crapshoot to me - how will you know which lane or which spot he'll blink to? Seems like you put a ward up in a spot and HOPE he'll go there. I don't get it. Is there anything else I can do? </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I build CM if I need to go "carry"? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-29 01:08:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I like to play supports that can transition into a semi-carry if necessary because of an underperforming team. Venge and Kunkka are two of my favorites for this. 

I love playing CM because of her aura that can compensate for a lot of wasted mana, since no one at my rank (often myself included) knows how to manage resources. But when my carries aren't good at farming, I'm not actually sure what to build on her to pick up their slack. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm generally the kinda person who will play the same game over and over anyhow, like shmups, to get high scores. So I don't THINK playing the same handful of heroes repeatedly is going to bore me, especially because I love heroes like Venge and Kunkka who are very diverse in how they begin and how they end, in terms of really both item and skill build.

But I'd still like an opinion. For people who like... spam 10,000 Slark games. Do you do it out of habit or are you still genuinely enjoying yourself? </TEXT>

<TITLE> How much of a book do you sample before you decide you want to read/buy it? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a bad habit of buying books purely based on acclaim and praise, not opening them to read a page or two. This is obviously a mistake, so this thread is as much a curiosity about how others approach this as it is a way to determine how I should do it myself.

What I've started doing is reading the first paragraph, the last paragraph, and the first paragraph on page 100, 200, 300, 400, etc. That last bit about a paragraph every hundred pages might be too excessive, maybe instead I should extend it to the first 2 pages of the book and the last paragraph.

Thoughts? What does everyone else do? </TEXT>

Is there anything else like this out there, whether the two are physically in the room or fancy video editing is used? I know Heather Feather kinda did this a few times, too.

<TEXT> I like a nice Goldilocks middle when it comes to the style/tone of a book, and yet that seems largely impossible. 

I can't stand Victorian literature. Not because it's difficult to understand, since I'd say any one sentence of a novel from that period is easy enough to understand. But you string them all together and it's so dry, you can really tell they were paid by word count.

But I can't really stand modern prose either, like DeLillo or Chabon. Sentences that seem like they should be short and sweet are peppered with this flowery language that makes me want to gag.

I'm so unforgiving of things that annoy me in books, I guess because, unlike TV, there aren't audiovisuals to occupy me when the characters or stories start testing my patience. 

Has anyone else ever felt maybe they don't like books as much as you wished you did? And what did you do about it? Did you take a break or did you look harder for books you might like? </TEXT>

And I'm always tempted to look at them, because they're new information on-screen, and decades of gaming have taught me anything new should be paid attention to. But really, I don't see the use of them for a casual like me other than cluttering up the screen and confusing me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've tried to read Eliot and Dickens. I want to like them, since they're supposed to be the start of where authors explore the psychological depth of their characters. But honestly, I can't make it through the prose. Where five words would do, they'd throw in another thirty. I know for Dickens this is partially because of the way he was paid. For Eliot, I'm honestly thinking that was just her style. 

Jane Eyre, so far, is the only novel from this era that is really fun to read. More like this would be great. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Skyward Sword is one of those games where I was so hyped that I lapped up sooo much pre-release material. Videos, screenshots, bullet point details. I was excited. I thought "this game is going to be MASSIVE", because I didn't once entertain the idea they'd show their entire hand before the game was released. But that is exactly what they had done. Except for the final dungeon, they showed every dungeon/gimmick/boss/item. There was little surprise left once I played the game for myself.


Because of that experience, I've refused to follow so closely the development of any video game. For Breath of the Wild, I've seen the trailers and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIrY56yg7dY), which is thankfully confined to the opening half hour. The problem is because I don't know what's in the game, I'm forming all these wild ideas in my head. For years I've wanted a game like the NES Zelda in 3D, where there's no hand holding and you simply stumble inside a dungeon through your own exploration. I know press releases have SAID that's what this game will be, but I don't know it until I see it. But I don't want to see it, due to how I spoiled Skyward Sword.

So, it's an odd little conundrum.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never really played a WRPG, however I've always been interested in them. Part of the reason I've avoided them is I know they can be long and involving affairs, and I don't want to get dragged into something for 10 hours or so only to realize there's not actually much depth.

So, the two games that I've always been super interested in ever since they were released are Divinity Original Sin and The Witcher 3. Divinity mostly for its clever ways you can interact with NPCs and The Witcher 3 for its overworld which seems like it would be fun to explore.

Other than these two, what else should i play? I tried Skyrim once and something about it just didn't really click with me. Though I know there are gameplay mods for it, maybe some of those could help.  </TEXT>

I'd prefer a game that doesn't necessarily rely on cut scenes to convey the dialogue. While I never did play The Last Story, I loved reading the reviews that stated there was a lot of chattiness between the party members while exploring the world. 

Can be either WRPG or JRPG, though right now I'm more in the mood for a WRPG. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like a battered housewife after hoping for three seasons that Doctor Who will once again be the show that I first loved. Now that we know Moffat is leaving, maybe that's going to happen. 

Chibnall as his replacement, however, worries me. Part of the reason Moffat **seemed** like such a great successor to Davies was he consistently wrote the best episodes during the RTD era. When allowed to direct the entire series instead of an episode here or there, of course Moffat got a little ridiculous. Chibnall doesn't have any celebrated episode and there's not much distinctive about his episodes that could give us a clue what he's going to do with the series.

So... have there been any juicy details yet? What does he plan to do? Do we know his favorite episodes of the show, maybe that could give us a clue what he might want to do in terms of mood, story, characters? </TEXT>

Chibnall as his replacement, however, worries me. Part of the reason Moffat **seemed** like such a great successor to Davies was he consistently wrote the best episodes during the RTD era. When allowed to direct the entire series instead of an episode here or there, of course Moffat got a little ridiculous. Chibnall doesn't have any celebrated episode and there's not much distinctive about his episodes that could give us a clue what he's going to do with the series.

So... have there been any juicy details yet? What does he plan to do? Do we know his favorite episodes of the show, maybe that could give us a clue what he might want to do in terms of mood, story, characters? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure this isn't a new thought, but it's one that's been nagging at me more and more. I read mostly classics and, sometimes, I want to read something newer to give me a break, to find a different writing style. Contemporary writing always seems to be one of two things, though: either it's poorly written to make a buck (your Twilights and Hunger Games of the world) or it's stuffy "literary" fiction that's dealing with very ordinary plots and people, which would be fine, that's totally my thing - except everything in them seems so sterile.

So, instead when I want something modern, inevitably I turn to TV - your cliche shows like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Justified, etc. And I have to wonder if that's just where all the best writers have gone, because I can't think of any other explanation. </TEXT>

<TITLE> If a band makes poor studio albums but is excellent in a live setting, how do you feel about that band? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Warpaint has me conflicted. They used to be one of my favorite bands, when it was just their EP and their debut. Their last two albums have been crap, in my opinion. But I decided to give them another shot and watch some live videos - and they're much better, it's like they're in their natural habitat.

Usually the saying goes that if a band can't recreate live what they did in the studio, that they're not that good. What about bands who are great in a concert setting but can't deliver a good studio album? Does that make them somewhat of a lesser band compared to the ones who can do both? </TEXT>

There is a fire and energy not present on the albums. Both of these performances just so happen to be from WFUV Public Radio, so there's a possibility their sound mixer is simply fucking good at what they do. 

But I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and say, yeah, Warpaint is still an amazing band who, unfortunately, makes poor decisions in the studio. Does anyone else get the feeling they're more in their element when performing live? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I have this classic literature that I read last year. While The Odyssey was presented in full (and I loved it, convinced it could be wiped out of history and released today as a bestseller in the fantasy aisle), The Iliad was only bits and pieces. And most of these excerpts were pretty boring, fights and action scenes. Not much dialogue or philosophical asides that I love to see in classic lit.

Are the two somehow so far removed that if you like one, you might not like the other? Or did the anthology maybe do a bad job of highlighting the interesting parts? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-10-03 04:05:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've heard differing opinions on this lately. Some say if you pull/stack/gank, secure farm for your carry, make an early game impact, etc, that you'll win because the enemy support won't play as well as you.

But the fact remains that games are won by farmed carries. If my carries refuse to last hit or even attempt to farm, just standing at mid waiting for a "potential" fight, what is my early game contribution going to do for anyone? Incidentally, this is the advice I hear most often, just pick a carry and dominate the game yourself if you want to win.

So which is it? As fun as I think it is to support, I seem to win more reliably when I play carry. Supporting is a gamble, hoping that your carries will do their job. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is probably something super obvious to all of you - since most of you are like 5k and always talking about all these concepts I don't see at low level Dota - but I noticed something today after 1300 hours of Dota. I'd always heard the neutral creeps dying and passed it off as an immersion factor. But if you know there are only three or only four creeps in a camp, or whatever number of them, you can count off how many deaths you hear and then when there's one left, that's when you pull.

This is going to be super helpful because I've never been able to find a good camera position where I can watch the creeps die and then pull the camp on time. So for the handful of people who don't know this, there you go. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm on a quest to stop supporting for a while and spam carries. Since these heroes are so popular, I'm wanting alternatives in case they're already taken.

Void is pretty easy for me, however he's typically an offlane hero. Does it really matter at 1k mmr which lane a pubstomper is played in?

Drow becomes fairly easy after a while, though I'm really bad at laning with her for some reason.

Luna is another one I love. She doesn't seem to do much during team fights (or I could very likely be playing her wrong?) so she seems like one of those heroes like Sven where you let your team 4 v 5, farm farm farm, then come out tearing the enemy apart.

Viper... if I can convince anyone to let me go mid, he's usually an easy one to end games fast. Death Prophet is the same way. Should I just fight for mid, knowing that I'm really good with those two heroes?

That's just a bit of brainstorming, really. Anything I should add or remove? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Early game, as soon as everyone gets to lane, players will immediately start attacking heroes instead of farming creeps, and they'll only farm creeps when the heroes leave to go regen. I can understand when supports do this, that's their job, but carries will ignore farm to hit each other. It's annoying as a support because, well, it's kinda hard to get anything done. And it's annoying when I see a carry do it because they should be farming.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Always been a fan of Acker since Angel. I think her performance as Root easily tops her already great performance as Fred. As for Emerson, I'd never seen anything of his since POI and I love everything about his gestures and diction, very commanding presence. Anyone heard news on what they're doing after POI?

I guess I could watch Lost for more of Michael Emerson, somehow never did watch that. Just a bit afraid that it's not going to hold up in 2016, I'd always heard the story got a bit too unwieldy and that the writers admitted they didn't have any concrete plan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've told a few of them that at the trench no one respects pos 1-5 farming system, that it's not even a thing anyone mentions. And they're like "No, you're wrong. I was in the trench once. Everyone knows about this system." 

In my experience, everyone is fighting for pos 1 carry in the trench. No one says "Ah ok, here's some farm for you... and some farm for you... and here's some for YOU!" This ain't Oprah, it's a pack of wild dogs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know a time loop like this can be rather cliche but it's a great way to show how an AI thinks about so many possibilities in a short amount of time. And it's pretty funny, too, I'd never seen the show really embrace its humor until this season.

I'm usually a fan of shorter seasons like Breaking Bad, and 22 episode shows usually have a lot of filler. But I don't think POI has any filler at all. I'm hoping when I get to season 5 that it doesn't feel rushed due to the shorter length. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had pretty good games with both of them even when I'm the only one warding and whatever, I buy aura items for team fights, and I feel like even if there's a rocky start sometimes during laning phase, we quickly bounce back either due to smoke cloud or track gold. But I feel like I could still improve, obviously. 

I don't think I should try to snipe the courier because most carries can't handle themselves alone. Should I just pull and gain a couple levels that way, like a normal support, then go roam? Or roam right from the beginning? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any one of his *TEN** spells would seem OP on any other hero. Deafening Blast can disarm you for up to 6.5 seconds. EMP can burn up to 625 mana. Ghost Walk can slow you down for up to 50%, not to mention gives him an extra 30% movespeed.

And while I did mention the highest values that can be achieved, even at low levels, these spells can be devastating. I don't really understand how to play around him unless you've got silences on your team. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are the most useful chat wheel commands? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been wanting to mute chat, for my own sanity. As far as I know, chat wheel commands are still displayed to teammates when I have them muted. And you've only got eight options. Some of these seem a bit redundant or useless, but there are enough good ones that I'd like some help.

"Get Back!" this one seems useful, however ctrl+alt+ping could serve the same purpose

"Push now" this one is probably also a little redundant because of alt+ping to enemy towers?

"Group up" "Spread out" "Split up and farm" all three of these sound decent to me

"I'm retreating" this one is probably super essential for someone not using chat or voice, so I'm including it without hesitation

"Out of mana" "Skills on cooldown" these seem possibly good, except you can alt-click on your health/skills, so probably not worth including 

(Similarly, the "missing bottom/mid/top" callouts seem pointless when you can be more specific by alt-clicking the enemy hero icon at top of the screen)

"Coming to gank" this one MIGHT be useful so I can warn them I'm about to help?

"Requesting a gank" however, this one seems possibly useless because I can't really trust strangers and try to focus on my game

"Destroy the tower, then get back" This one seems good

"Pulling creeps" I play a lot of support, so this one technically seems good.. except more than a few carries will ping me ask what I'm doing, so maybe it's not worth telling them

"Current Game Time" also seems pointless because you can alt-click the clock at top of the screen

So uh... yeah, a long musing to ask you - which ones do you use, which ones do you think are the best to use? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'd been trying to figure out why I lose so much lately, then I think I realized an important reason. I look at a hero, let's take Bounty Hunter as an example, and I expect him to be played as an aura carrier like the pros and high level pubstars run him. And almost every time, instead he goes with phase boots and deso and all that "outdated" shit. I keep forgetting, somehow, that anything that is "outdated" lives on at my MMR. Playing to the current meta only serves to fuck up my expectations of what both my teammates and enemies will do.

Am I making excuses here? Or am I on to something that I shouldn't ever expect that PA to go Vlads/Deso instead of BF, that I'll never see a Void build anything other than MoM for whatever bizarre reason, that Drow will always build Shadow Blade instead of Hurricane Pike?

And on the flip side, should **I** be playing heroes to the current meta at shit tier MMR? Taking the first example of BH, I do copy the pros in terms of item builds, and seem to do well with it. Should I keep doing this or would I have more success adapting to my MMR? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been trying to play support, thinking it's sooo essential to pull and stack and ward and harass and not steal exp from my carry and blah blah blah. Rarely does this seem to have an impact, because my carries can't farm. 

So I got to thinking, what if I go with "cant beat em, join em" and become a carry myself? At first, I hated this idea. But the past few days, my logic has been like this: you can still win a clowny game of Team Fortress 2 without a medic. In fact, sometimes that stupid three heavy/soldier team is going to win due to sheer brute force. So I'm thinking... if you don't *need* a medic in TF2 (though they're very nice to have), do you really *need* a support in Dota 2 (though they're very nice to have)?

Hell, I've noticed even wards aren't important as long as you keep your eyes glued to the minimap. </TEXT>

Right now, the only thing that comes to mind is Invoker for easy sun strikes - but really this is more of a way to help Invoker than Bloodseeker.

In fact, Bloodseeker seems so useless as a carry that I'm tempted to try playing him as a support role, to give vision to carries who can better gank enemy heroes. Can that work? </TEXT>

Games are often 60+ minutes for no justified reason. I guess I wouldn't take issue with a long game if it were truly a struggle, like that EG vs EHOME game at TI6, but in normal pubs the games are long simply due to childish fighting.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just had a 66 minute game. I lost, but that's not the point. Even when I win a 66 minute game, I want to gouge out my eyeballs. It's usually not because of some back-and-forth battling, but rather because my carries farm, farm, farm - and then don't do anything with it. They don't push or fight. They just keep farming. And by the time they've slowly built up their items - because, of course, they're BAD at farming - the enemy has better items and can slightly outplay them, thus winning the game.

So... what can I do in these all too common situations to make sure towers get pushed? Pushing a lane doesn't really do much because usually the enemy team sends two or three heroes down to clean it up. And it's not like we're simultaneously split pushing another lane to distract them and instead take THAT tower, because like I said these idiots are just farming the whole time like it's Diablo.

edit: Or another thing they'll do, they'll pretend to push one tier 3 tower, then go to another tier 3. They never finish what they start. Maybe I'm wrong - I do lose my fair share of games and pretty low MMR - but this seems pretty stupid to me. Shouldn't we focus on taking down one tower completely before moving on to the next? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the typical suggestion is Ghost Scepter, but why not Eul's? Gives you the disable, plus mana regen and movement speed. Unless she gets Aghs, this seems to be a better option to me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do you play Invoker before getting an Aghs? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-11 08:30:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I've never really played Invoker because of the whole intimidating factor. Part of this is because when you get Aghs, you can Cast All The Things and it's overwhelming to remember which spell is which three letter sequence.

However, Invoker confuses me just as much for a different reason. Before you do get Aghs, Invoke is on a fairly high cooldown considering how useful it is. How do you decide which two spells you need at any given moment? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Typically, you want to kill them so you can push a tower or take Rosh. But if they're low health and all run back like scared kittens, isn't that essentially the same victory, assuming you get a tower in the meantime? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are there any heroes who should NEVER build a gem? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-10 04:36:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The easiest way for me to counter Mirana, and much cheaper than spamming sentries, is to buy a gem. But once I do buy it, I tend to stick with the rest of my team in fear of losing it. I'll be more likely to do this if I'm someone like Ogre (higher HP) or Bounty (invis, enemy usually too stupid to buy detection against me)

But let's say I'm CM - should I just stick to spamming sentries or can someone squishy still hold a gem with careful positioning?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Which supports can I run solo and still push out the lanes when needed? [details/opinions inside] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-09 00:36:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm wanting to narrow down my hero pool for ranked. At low MMR, most of the time I'm a solo support. So I need a) a stun and b) a way to push and c) ??? maybe something else I'm forgetting.

The only 100%  supports I know I can play well and that fit the criteria are CM, Ogre, and Venge. [though Venge can't the best, she does have the aura]

At first, I was considering Wyvern but there's no stun other than her ult. So I think she's out.

Kunkka has the Tidebringer which is pretty nice, but I'm not 100% convinced he can solo support.

Naga Siren's images, even without Radiance, SEEM like they'd be good when pushing along with creeps. Maybe? Maybe not?

Venomancer is fantastic as pushing lanes and sometimes even taking towers, however he has no stun. Is his slow good enough? In my experience, yes, but it's possible I've just got lucky.

Shaman - he's supposed to be really good, but in my experience, the enemy comes and destroys the serpent wards before they do much of anything. 

Lion - great disables. Can he really push, though? Earth Spike has a small potential, but doesn't seem good enough.

Dazzle - again, he's got a slow instead of a stun. How much does this matter? </TEXT>
