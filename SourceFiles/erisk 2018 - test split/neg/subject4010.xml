<TITLE> Should there be any more "Lord of the Rings" movies? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Just a thought. Since there are a lot of stories and books about other characters and events, should there be more movies or perhaps games that portray them? Maybe like a Game of Thrones type series with the same budget. Since there's more books coming out there could be potential spin offs that extend the lore for those who haven't read the books. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get what you mean, having the story only focus on one assassin in one time period would be awesome and perhaps what they should've done in the first place. I'll agree with you that the future setting in the recent games has been relatively shit. But I still enjoyed it.

What I meant by the series not making any sense without the modern setting was that the story of the games wouldn't make sense without it. They're all about finding this or that piece of Eden to save everyone some bullshit. Without the modern era it would just be us finding a piece of eden for no real reason, why bother showing us this story if there's no point in it?

That being said the modern era story in the movie was a little weird sometimes and they probably could have made the story more intriguing and mysterious if they had a limited amount of story in this era. Like the first game did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It being terribly handled is one thing, it being necessary is another. Sure it would be cool to play assassins in this or that era but it wouldn't make any sense at all they way they have done it this far if they did that. There wouldn't be any point to even have a game in that era without the modern day because the entire reason for us players even playing through it is because we need to save the future. REGARDLESS IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, that is the way the games are set up, that is the whole ordeal with Assassin's Creed and the concept that the developers came up with. If you don't like that then too bad, guess this franchise isn't for you people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. The entire series wouldn't make shit sense if the modern day wasn't there. Feels like a lot of people don't get that. Only reason for going into the past is to prevent something from happening in the future. Just because the modern day era hasn't been presented well doesn't mean it should not exist at all. Tbh I just wish they fix the modern day era and get a new protagonist in both the modern and ancient era so we can just finish this series on a high note... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well from what I understand HL3 has always been in some sort of development but just never branching out. Many people at Valve have tried to develop it, they draw concept art, develop ideas for the story, work on other projects like the source 2 engine. Then people leave that dev group to work on something else like a new IP, an new engine, Virtual Reality, etc. It's not just new hats for TF2, it's a whole company with a ton of property making money and they're constantly working on something. At the moment they're currently working on a new and old IP(I'm not completely sure though, said to be both multiplayer and singleplayer.), integrating source 2 into their games(Dota2) and making billions of money of the big three, CS:GO, Dota2 and Team Fortress 2. I really hope HL3 will be released some day, and I hope that we may see some easter eggs for it when they eventually come out with a new game. But I wouldn't think much of it because they're probably never going to :p </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the problem is that one person wanting to work on it isn't enough. There has to be a whole group of people joining in to work on it. The way Valve works is very different from other game companies, they have way more freedom when it comes to development. If someone don't want to work on something they just hop on over to another team/project. That's why HL3 has been in dev hell for almost a decade, because there haven't been a group effort or anyone wanting to make it. New people won't fix that problem. </TEXT>

When I first loaded it up I got the message to go through the prologue of the SP. I've re-downloaded the game before and this has never happened. Fortunately I had backed up the save files in case of this happening and replaced the current empty files with the backed up ones. After that the game just won't load at all. Help? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the vents wouldn't have opened if Rory left the lab with the flamethrower, only reason they did was because the tip of the flamethrower got close to one of the sensors. Maybe he stayed because Calvin could easier find a way out of the lab due to his small size? Maybe he thought that if he let Calvin eat him and get bigger, he would be too big to escape from the lab?..
Tbh I can't find a good reason why Rory stayed :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish they could make movies like this where the characters aren't always making such idiotic decisions. I'm not saying all of them we're idiots but just one scene that did not make any sense to me. [When Rory(RR) goes in to save Hugh from Calvin, he gets attacked and manages to get Calvin off him. Why didn't he just leave the room when he had the flamethrower ready and Calvin at the opposite side of the room? Or better yet, WHY LOOK FOR IT WHEN HE'S OUT OF FUEL? Sure there was a couple of scenes where the characters fucked up but this one was just a bad, stupid, shitty way to continue the plot..](#spoiler) </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. The way I understood it was that basically the bad guys don't have any power over them when they cross the border, their jurisdiction ends because it's not their country anymore. Also because the people at Eden we're waiting for them which could probably stop them from getting the kids. Most likely a mix of the two though.

2. They didn't. They only put the claws in. In the scene from the nurses phone we only see them put the claws in at the arms and feet. Not a whole body laminated with the stuff cause like you said, she wouldn't be able to grow.

3. Maybe, but I highly doubt they would have any with them and Logan's wounds seemed too terminal for it to save him in time, plus even when he was on the stuff earlier it didn't seem like it helped THAT much. </TEXT>

I've tried formatting the disk, used disk management, tried disk cleanup and delete previous versions. Nothing worked. I don't know what else to do because anything I try doesn't work. Only way I know what file is taking up 16 gig of space is because if I copy the disk and paste it somewhere else  I get access denied. I also tried deleting through cmd but it doesn't register anything being on the disk. Anyone got any ideas on how to force delete the folder or combine the partitions into one complete drive? </TEXT>

One thing I'm definitely excited about is how he can continue this and if that means waiting another year then hell yeah. </TEXT>

Also no, I didn't notice the stick automatically going into my inventory where my axe should be and none of my friends + any players I've asked have noticed that. I don't have a problem with zombies being strong, but when their hits are so extremely random and can hit from 2 meters away it's really annoying. When a pristine item on you can go to ruined state in one hit it's really annoying.

<TEXT> Ok, I recently started playing again with some friends thinking-- scratch that, HOPE, that we were going to have some fun. That didn't happen. Except we encountered bugs at every corner and glitches that makes you say "Why tf is this still in a game that has been out this long?"

Let me list up several things that's wrong and game breaking for players:

1. A 1 - 2m fall will kill you. Instantly. No unconscious, no leg breaking, no screaming out in pain, just death.

2. Military tents are about as hard to put down as throwing a ball into a bucket while driving a car on top of a bridge 5000 feet up in the air. It is literally impossible to put it down where you want to put it down. Unless you want to put it in the middle of an open field where everyone can see it is impossible.

3. Thanks for changing my axe with a long stick without my consent after cutting down a tree, really appreciate that.

4. Cars won't even start and there's absolutely no reason they shouldn't. Got the battery? Check. Got the sparkplug? Check. Got 4 pristine wheels? Check. Refueled that bad boy up completely? Check. Start the car? No f*cking chance. Even if the frame is somehow not pristine it should at least START. Or even better, let us fix the damn thing and even see if it's damaged. Like we did in the fkn mod? And while we're on about cars..

5. Thanks for adding the teleportation device inside vehicles, really love the sci-fi take on the post apocalyptic doom that we're all playing in. Even with ping as low as 20 on a server the car/truck/bus you're driving will teleport 4 meters to the left or right without warning. We've lost about 4 cars because of this so far...

6. If you're carrying two guns at you and change into your axe because a zombie attacks you, say goodbye to the one you had in your hands. Cause that one has either despawned or somehow got dropped beneath the ground. 

7. Zombies, ahh zombies. I remember a time when they weren't such a pain in the ass. Like when they didn't follow you through 4 towns without showing signs of stopping. Or when they couldn't hit you from 2 meters away. Or when their hits wasn't ruining your pristine jacket in one punch or made you bleed with one hit.

8. Oh boy how I love eating food. I wish I could spend half the time playing this game looking for it and eating it! Well now you can. Even if you somehow manage to scrap yourself up to a light green hydrated and energized you just go half an hour and you're back at starving again. Only in DayZ can you be stuffed and starve at the same time.

9. Hypothermia. This is just the best addon you guys could come up with, cause this game just HAVE to be as realistic as humanly possible doesn't it Rocket? Me and my friends have died multiple times of this bullshit we quit playing if it starts to rain on the server. Run in the rain for 1 minute? Hypothermia.

10. Last of probably many to come. After finding me and my friend's base got raided during the night we decided to switch location and find a more suitable area for our utopia. And when I finally found the best of spots, I took my military tent out of my car and tried to put it down. (Read 2 for more info on how that went) Alas, as I pressed the letter G on my electronical board of keys my character decided to throw this 100 pound tent like it was a tennisball into the unknown. I spent half an hour looking for my tent in the shiny outer doors of chernarus but had no luck finding my dearest. It had either despawned, thrown deep underground, or somehow landed in Elektro confusing a freshspawn wondering why it's raining tents.

Last thing and this is directly to the devs. Change back to the format the mod had, not 100% copy paste but get back the most important shit. Don't make it so impossibly hard to have fun in this game. Loot is almost nonexistent anymore and fixing up cars feel much more like a chore than it did in the mod. You only needed a motor, wheels, fuel tank and some scrap metal to fix it up and THAT is all you should need in a GAME. I loved the health bar hud from the mod, it's much easier to keep up with rather than getting a pop up message. Just, don't make the game so extremely realistic and bring it back to the good old DayZ it USED to be.

Tl;Dr Dayz is broken.

EDIT: Alright, I get it, you guys hate criticism and love to bitch to people when they point out flaws in an early access/in development game. about 90% of you people said that what I've listed is wrong and is bullshit while I'm saying this is from experience. YOU can't fucking say otherwise. If we can't call out the flaws of this game NOW in this format how the hell are we supposed to? How are the devs going to fix it if no one is calling out the bugs and everyone is praising it for the garbage it currently is?
Also for you people telling me this is not my type of game or "go play the mod", kindly fuck off. I've played the mod, I loved the mod, I played SA since fucking launch and I've enjoyed most of it. But simply wanting this game to be BETTER isn't bitching, or whining, or ranting, or any of the bullshit you guys call it. I wasn't pissed, or angry when I wrote this, I was neutral and tired of bugs still not being fixed and decided to make a post on the hope that some of this may get fixed. Fucking grow up man.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I linked my windows 10 to my microsoft account yesterday, after that I couldn't use the password I always used to log into my pc. Only the password to my microsoft account worked. Problem is I hate the strict rules where you **need** one upper case and a number for it to be a "strong" password. Ffs microsoft just let me use my normal password without all this bullshit.

Is it possible to have one password for login and another one for your microsoft account or do they **have** to be the same? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been helping my friend on Daybreak's site, made a ticket and everything. They asked if we could guess the answer to the secret question and we did. We even added proof that we are the real people trying to access his account and not some hacker. We cave them the account name and a picture of him accessing his email connected to the account. After all of this they say that HE should make an account and basically do all of this over again for some stupid reason and that they can't do shit without the secret answer.

How fucking stupid are these people, we've done everything we can, given them EVERYTHING they need to fix this, all they have to do is just reset the secret question/answer or change the answer to what we want. Ffs Daybreak we just wanna play h1z1 but you guys make it so damn fucking hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The current system destroys teens and children's motivations to even finish school. I graduated High school last year but didn't get my diploma because I failed one class, aka German. It was because of several reasons, mainly lack of any motivation to learn the language because I deemed it completely unecessary, having three different teachers throughout High School that didn't care/got angry too easily/or did too little too late. I wouldn't say I'm a bad student, I'm more on the middle on the grading cane. I excelled in some classes and not so much in others. The fact that this one class I failed could decide that I can't choose the education I want/excel in infuriates me and makes me feel like a failure. On my very last exam(Architecture   Design) I got a 5+ (B+ for you Americans) and good grades in these type of classes. Next year I'm going to college for Architecture but after that I don't even know if I can continue on this path that I, some of my teachers and family think I should go. The fact that this class was not optional and I had no choice is also, very demotivating. If it was something else like english I would've made it without question. FYI I'm Norwegian and I'm about as good in english as norwegian.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Start with the way they came out, Asylum, City, Origins and Knight. Origins wasn't made by the same team but is still great in my eyes. Plus the story isn't that connected to the other games so you won't have to worry about that. Plus the maps gets larger and larger for each game, in Asylum you're on an island, in City it's a walled of part of Gotham, in Origins it's the same as City but years earlier plus a similar sized island connected with a bridge and in Knight it's the biggest one with three new islands. </TEXT>

Htf do I un-hide apps?

<TEXT> I completely agree with almost everything you said, after watching the movie I wanted to know more about what happened to their characters and how this will/may tie in with the games in any way. Only thing I disagree with you is the death of Maria. I thought it was perfect the way it was shown. It showed the dedication of the members of the creed where they wouldn't let their emotion control the outcome of the events. It was either save Maria and maybe lose the apple/get killed in the process or kill the pope/saint guy.  But because he chose to try to save her she died right away which almost resulted in him getting killed.
The beginning was alright but could've been shortened a little bit. The ending was a little confusing to me with Sofia's change of heart. I was really sure they would make her join the assassins instead of her taking her fathers place since she didn't like what he was going to do with the apple.

Other than that I really liked the movie, the action was awesome and i believed in the characters motivations. Really hope that it gets a sequel and that the box office or critics ruins that chance cause this was a 7.5/8 from me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spider-man 3 could've been so, so great. I've re-watched all of the movies and my biggest problem with the 3rd is that it feels like 2 movies cramped into one. The scenes between Eddie Brock and Peter should've been drawn out into 2 movies where the 1st would show how peter takes his job and ruins his career and the 2nd would show eddies hatred toward peter and becoming venom. Same with Harry, they would fight and leave Harry scarred, fast forward to the next film with Harry's face being healed and etc..

<TEXT> Been trying to kill them both with and without summons and each time they manage to pull some bullshit insta-kill on me. Either 2 hit kill with full health or getting a backstab animation from the front. The npc summons are the worst, they only take damage and don't do shit, they don't even hold one of the bosses away from me which makes it impossible for me to kill even one when the two other summons are just getting bashed by Mr.Backstab or Wannabe Havel...

<TEXT> Just a thought I've had for a while. Their Animated Universe so far has introduced a ton of characters without being too dark or feeling overcrowded.

Why DC and Warner Brothers doesn't get this is just beyond me. Also this version of batman is definitely the best one in my mind.. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tips for meleeing Darklurker? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-02 22:52:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've tried everything... I've upgraded atunements to have more spells, I've takes loads of magic resistant shit, got all kinds of magic, dark and fire resistant rings, got an upgraded rebel greatshield and a +10 Zweihander. I've tried every pyromancy spell I have and gotten the best one you can get (Chaos Storm) and they barely do any damage against it. (Why the fuck did the devs nerf pyromancy for this boss :() Hitting it with my sword goes all well and good until the thing splits in two and makes it impossible to even hit one of them without loosing half my health. Does anyone have any tips or ways I can kill it more effectively?

EDIT: I managed to kill it (Thank god..), I upgraded my Pyromancy to +10 which I had totally forgotten you could do. I had a light armor set so I could gain stamina easily and run around more when I needed to block the attacks. The armor and weapons I used was:


Head: [Dark Mask](http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Mask_(Dark_Souls_II)

Torso: [Armor of Aurous +4](http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Armor_of_Aurous)

Arms: [Dark Gauntlets](http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Gauntlets_(Dark_Souls_II)

Legs: [Dark Leggings](http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Leggings_(Dark_Souls_II)

Right hand: [Pyromancy flame +10](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Pyromancy+Flame)

Left hand: [Transgressor's Leather Shield](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Transgressor's+Leather+Shield) (Which I had imbued with Dark at [Steady Hand McDuff](http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Steady_Hand_McDuff) at [The Lost Bastille](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Lost+Bastille), since Darklurker does almost only dark damage the shield had 100% dark resistance. Bought it for 8000 souls from [Chancellor Wellager](http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Chancellor_Wellager) in [Drangleic Castle](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Drangleic+Castle).)

Ring 1: [Ring of Binding](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Ring+of+Binding) (So my health wasn't 50%)

Ring 2: [Cloranthy Ring +1](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Chloranthy+Ring)

Ring 3: [Dark Quartz Ring +1](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Dark+Quartz+Ring)

Ring 4: [Clear Bluestone Ring +1](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Clear+Bluestone+Ring) (Shortens spell casting time)

The Pyromancy spells I used was: [Great Combustion](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Great+Combustion),[Flame Swathe](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Flame+Swathe), [Firestorm](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Firestorm) and [Chaos Storm](http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Chaos+Storm) which I got from the chest on the lava rocks in Iron Keep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dark Souls 2 have a big variety in bosses that ruins the gameplay for one build while being better for another build. The first boss that comes to mind is Darklurker (which is an optional boss) who is basically impossible for melee builds and peace of cake for mage builds. I've been going through DS2 the last weeks with a friend of mine and most of the other bosses seemed easy for me while some were hard as ball for my friend (who plays a mage btw). For the last 3 days I've tried to do Darklurker (which you can ONLY do alone) with my char and I'm so close to giving up. I've leveled up my atunement a ton so I could use more pyromancy spells against her but it barely does anything. Why the devs nerfed pyromancy for this boss is beyond me, it basically makes the boss impossible for all melee based builds. You also need to use a human effegie each time you want to retry the boss AND you gotta go through a ton of hard dark npc's.

TL;DR Bosses fuck up builds, devs fuck up bosses, all fuck up you.

PS This is the only problem I have with DS2 though, everything else is great but this breaks the game for me. Don't want to not kill the boss either but it's basically impossible for me and I've tried everything I can try :L </TEXT>

<TEXT> It started with my pc being stuck updating, not during a startup but when I manually checked for updates. It never moved on or found any updates, just stuck. So I tried to find a solution for that online and one guy said that booting it up in safe mode worked for him. I thought I could try it out and tested it. Now my pc continuously restarts itself IN safe mode (screen is zoomed in, bad graphics, etc), it restarts just a couple of seconds after showing the log in screen and I can't do anything to fix this. Help!

EDIT: I'm adding this solely on the chance if anyone other than me ever gets this glitch or bug in the future. When my pc booted up the only things I could access was either BIOS or the 'safe mode' menu that pops up when you spam f8. I don't remember exactly which of the options that worked but I tried all of them and managed to fix the problem. After that it booted up to a safe mode in windows, I pressed windows button + R, typed in msconfig, unchecked the 'boot up on safe mode' button and restarted. Fixed my problem. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since Rise of Iron is the last thing to come out before Destiny 2 I think they should re-open the raids from year one and two so that players can get semi-end game gear. 

Since you need a fireteam of 6 people to even do it, playing through it solo is out of the question. (Yes I know it is possible but why should we have to do that anyway)

It's like a part of the story that I'l never be able to play because I first got Destiny when Taken King came out, and since the raids are basically useless no one is going to play it.

If they opened up the previous raids so that you could get gear up to 385 in light level, all of those people like me could finish those stories. Or just make it another way to gear up for the final raid so we don't only have to do the strikes all the time </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would pick Black Flag, the game is much bigger than either of the Metro games and the story and gameplay seem more fun to be honest. Metro is more of a fps game so it really hinges on what you prefer. Both of the games are great and have an awesome story and gameplay but I think that out of the two choices, Black Flag is the better one :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that, the most perfect way they could introduce this franchise to movie watchers would be adapting the novel. The first movie could be a straight adaptation of the book and show how the world of Rapture works, all the goods and bads, how it came to be. The second movie could focus more on the aftermath of the fall. The first movie could focus more on the bright possibilities that  Rapture presents, and what it would mean in the long run. While the second movie could show the more, dark version that we see in the games. A lost and destroyed underwater city with crazy people killing eachother. A perfect adaptation for that one would be following the story of [Mark Meltzer](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Mark_Meltzer), and the movie could end with him being a big daddy walking around with his daughter in the dark and gritty rapture. Basically a dark ending, with a after credits easter egg which could show Columbia through one of the rifts throughout the city and hype everything up for a third and final movie. How that one would be adapted I have no idea.. Perhaps a straight adaptation could work with that one in some way since Booker is the first protagonist to actually SPEAK.. I do have some casting ideas for the movies though.
Benedict Cumberbatch as Ryan Andrews, Cate Blanchett as Sofia Lamb, [Cassidy Freeman](https://31.media.tumblr.com/bf2ce7df37986e03a0e105988bdc126f/tumblr_inline_nkb4xwy99w1qma8zx.jpg) as Rosalind Lutece, [Ewan McGregor](https://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/image/upload/c_limit,h_1200,q_auto,w_960/a05nowtvkijrgbcvyvoi.jpg) as Robert Lutece, and Bryan Cranston as Comstock.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think basing a movie from the game would be smart, at all. Being a silent OP protagonist only works in the game franchise tbh. Although, the book "Bioshock Rapture" would be PERFECT, and I mean PERFECT, for a movie if it was done right. I remember reading it and just imagining scenes that could be in the movie. It could introduce all or most of the characters from rapture and just show how it all started since we only get to read about it or see a fraction of it from short cutscenes or dlc's. Then after that, the second movie could pick up after the fall of rapture, with a guy looking for his daughter in rapture.

Also when I read the book each time I read about Andrew Ryan or Sofia lamb I always pictured Benedict Cumberbatch as Ryan and Cate Blanchett as Sofia Lamb. Both are great actors and I seriously think they could pull of those characters perfectly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finished the series a couple of months ago for the 3rd or the 4th time, and I also wanted a movie set in this universe. Although I think if a movie ever got made they should do the same thing they're doing with the AC movie. Don't base it off the characters from the game but have a own story with characters made for the movie.

I remember in Bioshock 2 there was audiofiles you could pick up and listen to, specifically the guy who went down into rapture to find his little girl. I think that if they made a movie, it should have a similiar arch as that character. Make the movie have a dark tone, follow a character that has lost his daughter. Let the story have the same fate as the one in the games, aka, being turned into a big daddy to finally be with his little girl. The next movies could either follow the same characters or introduce more, and somehow bring in the connection between Rapture and Columbia. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the movie suffered allot by having too much story in it. The movie felt like it randomly changed halfway, like after the peter/harry fight there must've been a huge time gap between then and the end since Harry's injuries are literally completely healed up. Same could've been said about Venom in the movie, if they had shown Eddie and what Peter did to him in the 3rd movie and then continue with the church scene in the 4th movie it would've made a much bigger impact. And the fact that Harry joins Peter so fast after a little chat with the butler annoys me. The entire movie should've been split up into 2 parts. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [EVERYTHING] Gendry knows how to re-work Valyrian steel. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-11 15:29:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For a little while I've come up with this theory about Gendry, and that he might be able to re-work Valyrian steel. I don't have any proof that says "Gendry just knows how" but I figured out a couple of things that could perhaps prove it.

First off, in [Season 4 Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCItXEFnen0) we see Tywin Lannister reforging Ned Starks sword Ice. Which is made into the swords Oathkeeper and Hearteater/Widows Wail. In the episode Jaime says "No ones made a Valyrian steel sword since the doom of Valyria". Which Tywin answers with that there are only three living smiths who knows how to re-work Valyrian steel and that the **finest** of them was in Volantis. This is where my theory comes in, that one of the three smiths that could re-work Valyrian steel was [this](http://imgur.com/a/VYPSV) guy. Gendrys teacher.

The theory is that Gendrys teacher knew how to re-work the material and teached Gendry how. We already know that he is a skilled blacksmith (horned helmet) and can learn how to forge things pretty fast. From [S03E06](https://youtu.be/vEj1aN_Rmj0?t=5m50s).

I think that if he knows how to re-forge the steel he would be really useful in the upcoming seasons, we know Valyrian steel could kill a white walker so maybe he could help out in some way. Please tell me if it's a believable theory and if not, why doesn't it work.

EDIT: Thanks to /u/jordanmp16 we know who Gendrys master is, apparently his name is [Tobho Mott](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tobho_Mott), he is a master armorer and is one of the few smiths who knows how to re-forge Valyrian steel. This makes my theory much, much more believable and able to be revealed in the upcoming seasons/books. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was actually thinking that, if one country or city decided to become moneyless it would have to branch itself off of the rest of society. Then if it works the rest of the world could gradually do the same over time. I've been playing bioshock for the last couple of weeks now and the idea came from that, in the game Andrew Ryan built his own city to get away from the rest of the world and made his own rules of how HIS society would work. Not saying that making a underwater city full of drugusers is the way to go but the way to do it could perhaps work in the real world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would love a sequel/reboot of the series. I would actually want them to go the way they were going before the last of us, making the games grittier, more realistic, and more detailed. I thought it looked awesome and really hoped that they would continue doing that. I'm not saying I hate the last games, infact I love them to death. But would I rather have a new game/s that have updated game mechanics, engine and level design? **F*ck. Yes.**

Plus people like me(I'm 19) grew up with the games and the style and feel that they had fit the time and age we were in, since the generation that grew up with it (like me) are now basically adults, having to re-visit **the same characters and lore** in a much more adultier version than before? Yes. **Please.** Ratchet and Clank never really shifted their tone like Jak and Daxter did so I get why their new game is still more kid friendly but I hope that Naughty Dog **never** goes that route on Jak and Daxter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Infinite would be a terrible adaptation of the game series, atleast for the first movie. And a straight adaptation wouldn't fit for a movie at all. If they ever made a movie they shouldn't use the characters from the game but rather make new ones that fit the lore, have them pop up in some way instead. Like in bioshock 2 when you hear about what happened in the first game and that character.

I would love to see them make a movie about someone finding rapture before the fall and being turned into a big daddy (like Delta in B2) or after the fall when Lamb was kidnapping girls all over the world, have a protagonist who is looking for his daughter and going through all of the shit in Rapture. Have some horror elements and show how terrifying rapture after the fall could be. Have the first movie end with the father being one of the alpha series big daddy and walking around with his actual daughter(which is a little sister). Have them flesh out the lore a bit and show bits and pieces on how rapture and columbia is connected, which would open up for sequels. They CAN'T use the main protagonists from the games in the movies,then it would just turn into a horrible adaptation like every other game-to-movie franchise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well that's a hard one.. Only thing I can think of is the rare moment of co-operation between players in any multilayer game. Like say Portal 2, you can get a shitty person as a parter in the co-op missions but sometimes get someone who helps and knows the game enough to be efficient. Or when you play a sandbox game like Garry's Mod and somehow turn friends with someone else playing on the same server, maybe get in a "fight" with other players *with* that person which would create a short friendly bond. Or when you manage to convince a whole lobby of players in any game to do something different with the game play instead of the normal thing, like Cod or Battlefield where you just have some bs fun for a while with the enemy team.(Just thought of the Megalodon easter egg in BF4 where you would need an amount of players to even trigger the event, most likely people from the enemy team.) But I think that events like these is something that happens to everyone every once in a while, like a need to help someone out or to just get the feeling you get when you interact with another person on something entertaining. Btw I remember when this happened to me when I met a guy on Garry's Mod years ago on a random server, we started playing and turned into friends. Now I consider him one of my closest friends in real life and he lives countries away. So you can say that the need for co-operation or interaction with players in any game would be something that has always been there, even when online multiplayer didn't exist you could bring a group of friends home and play and get the same results, sorta.

Btw this might sound like it comes from a 40+ year old guy but I'm just 19, just to make sure that you don't need to be ancient to know how this works :p </TEXT>

The film industry barely make any movies that has the same quality as the ones made in the early 2000s, and by quality is mean that new films nowadays have way too much CGI and high quality resolution. I feel like when I watch a movie that came out today they have too much hd, contrast,lensflares(jj) for it too feel realistic. Movies like Fight Club, Lord of the Rings or even the Matrix didn't feel like they where overly abused with contrast or hd. Same goes fro tv series, shows like supernatural felt gritty, real and a little contrast. Now the series can barely be distinguished from a men's clothing commercial with the cast looking like models for f*cks sake...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every game I've played has run alright on Win10 so far, and I've had it since July last year. Only thing I'm not a fan of is the style and setup of basically everything, it took a while to get used to. Went online to find a few tips on how to change a couple of things to make it more similar Win7 and it makes it more bearable. So if you love the look and feel of Win7 and don't like too much changes, don't upgrade to Win10. On the other hand I think that everyone HAS to upgrade to Win10 at some point either they want to or not, just to play the new games that are coming out. Most likely more and more games will stop supporting Win7 and start using Win10

TL;DR Afraid of changes? Don't change. Don't mind them? Upgrade, eventually you'll have to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of movies being adapted from games suck because there hasn't really been anyone really trying to make it right. The Silent Hill wasn't good but not bad either, somewhere in-between. So I get why you're saying that but when you get a great director, cast members and a compelling story the movie instantly get a bigger chance of becoming a good/great movie. Like the upcoming Assassin's Creed movie or Warcraft movie, both have great cast members and directors AND the difference from the other video game adaptations is that these are actually made by the companies that made the games. </TEXT>

Let me start in the beginning. The games wasn't just successful for showing us a couple of white hooded gentlemen going around killing people for a greater cause. It wasn't just because of the lore that crafted its way throughout the next entries. It was because of it's unique consept that the game brought and showed us. That we (as in Desmond) had to go through the memories of our ancestors to find essential information to save the present day. All of this was growing theoughout the next games and was a reminder that the games wasn't about killing templars in the past, but that what we did in the past had consequenses for the present. We saw how Desmond trained, turned into an assassin, what happened to the ancient ones and the ones that came before. When he died the series just went downhill with the modern day era, with what made the games so special in the first place. Black Flag wasn't as good on that part but it was acceptable and a unique take on the modern day part, the sequels after that just ruined it more and more. Giving us cutscenes that barely mattered and just made us irritated. Unity barely had any modern day story and in the end, everything that happened in unity didn't have **any** importance to anything. It was just so they could have a game set in the french revolution. Syndicate did it slightly better but it was still horribly bad on that front compared to the first games. I can count the number of cutscenes on one hand from that game.

Look also on what the last games have been about, what the goal was. In BF there was the vault, being able to find anyone anywhere with a drop of their blood, never had anymore consequenses in the following games or never mentioned at all. Unity, finding that sage before the templars, which in the end was all a waste of time since the sages body was put in the catacombs.(There's also that 1st civ sword that did 't mean anything.) Syndicate, find the shroud. Now Syndicate did allot of things better than Unity but could still have been much, much better. We see Shaun getting a bit personal about Deamonds death, that Desmond got a 10 year old sage kid, that Juno is planning something and that the templars is going to do something with the shroud. (Revive an ancient civ perhaps, maybe revive Desmond(hopefully) or just make successful clones) Also pitching the idea of the modern protagonist being Desmond's son, in syndicate we learn he's in New York, he's a sage and he's 10. If the rumours are true then he could be 12 by the time the next game comes out. From the last cutscene in Syndicate a templar says they could take him in, keep him in an animus for 50+ years. Let's say they do get him, shaun and co get him out from abstergo, introduced to the character and viola, new protagonist from the 21st century. (Also remember that Desmond's son was [mentioned](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yGAei3thVhM) waaaay back in brotherhood by subject 16.)

Now since we barely have any modern day era left in the games it wouldn't make sense for them to set up a villain like Juno as they have in the recent entries after Desmonds death. In Black Flag we learned that she transformed into the system, in Unity there was absutley nothing and in Syndicate we learned she was getting stronger, *preparing* herself for an upcoming battle. So let me say this to all of you haters and fans, do you really, *really*, want the games most anticipated villain get a horrible anti climatic ending in a 2 minute cutscene just so the games can be set in an exotic/historically important era? 

This is for Ubisoft directly if any one of them is actually following the subreddit. Don't shrink the part that made the games so great in the first place, don't kill the structure which the first games built up, the part that made it *it*. Go back to the roots and fix the problem the last games have been suffering from, the lack of a modern day stoyline and modern protagonist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing I thought S3 did good, setting up the venom character. Just setting him up, not the way they used him. Look at the way Brock is introduced, what happens to him. His storyarch in the movie would've been so much better if they stopped using him after he lost everything. Then continued the film with sandman like Raimi originally wanted. The venom characters story wouldn't have felt so rushed, and they could have used him in a sequel instead so that he could have gotten the screentime/character development he deserved.

Otherwise the movie had it's problems, the Peter/Harry story was awesome but could have been done better when it comes to harry going all #TeamSpidey since his butler says so. Also one of the best scenes in the movie is the creation of sandman, how he basically wills himself into existence again was beautiful. Other than the uncle-Bens-killer-was-actually-this-guy bullshit they pulled, the character was great. Studio interferrence is a bitch... </TEXT>

<TEXT> How about this. Let's say the rumors are true and they won't release a new game before the end of 2017. They would have a lot of time making the game and making it great, soundtrack wise, visually, story and gameplay, and the game will be set in ancient Egypt.

So going out from these facts how would they show the modern world story? Do a similar formula to what the first games did, bring in a new character, a new anchor to the series. AND have characters from before like Rebecca, Shaun and Desmond's dad show up to connect with both old and new players.

They could have a new guy that's been taken by Abstergo and was held in the same facility as Desmond was. The Assassin's need this new guy because his ancestors lived in ancient Egypt, finding some first civ tech that would be important to the modern storyline. They would also need a reason for doing all of this, same as the 2012 apocalypse when it comes to danger. Let's say the Templars side in with Juno or something(Not necessarily but keep her as the big baddy and Templars as the enemy of the assassins.) and the new protagonist and Co. would need his ancestors from ancient Egypt to stop Juno.

Now, since this game is set in Egypt we could see the next games continue with the character from that time go to different locations. Like Ezio did with Rome, Masyaf, Constantinople, etc. I also have to mention that since the pyramids is in Egypt I'm thinking that's probably some 1st civ tech, and that the pyramids around the world is also this. They all fit together on a global scale where we could see our ancient character go too, first Egypt, China, Russia, something new. Perhaps even the Garden of Eden that we see Adam and Eve escape from in that video from AC2. (Perhaps that's the place Juno is since she's the only one we see in the video, we do see some other "humans" but she's the only one of her kind in the video.) The pyramids could be the key to stop Juno from either taking over the world or destroying it. All this would be played out over a new trilogy.

Back to the new character, I think Ubisoft have a great opportunity to be just as good as they used to be. The mysteries about all the subjects they had was incredibly interesting and amazing. The beginning of the game could go like this. We start off in ancient Egypt where the the ancestor of the protagonist either experiences something dramatic or a short glimpse of first civ tech. Similar to the first game, they go to far in the memory cycle that they can't access it properly. The new character is shown being in an Abstergo animus with someone saying 'He can't take it much longer' and another person saying 'We'll stop when I say we stop'. Showing us a new Templar character that doesn't care about our well being, like [Warren Vidic](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Warren_Vidic). Shortly after, the protagonist is being broken out of Abstergo by let's say Shaun, have William(Desmond's dad) being in the getaway vehicle while Rebecca is in their hideout. The protagonist is halfway awake from being messed with in the animus, so while William drives away Shaun is asking our new character for their name. They say it, then faints. (Let's say they didn't know his name from before but only knew his subject number, subject 18 if you want) The camera then goes further away. Showing the car drive away while the Abstergo building being in the middle of the screen, cue in Assassin's Creed title and we got our new and old characters with an awesome ancient storyline ready to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hopefully if the rumors are true then the next game will come out in 2017, so more work will be done in making it and have it work better with the music, settings and storyline. I agree with you on the not just having a chase to find the next ancient tech. Perhaps do the same formula they did with the first games. Have a storyline that stretches over multiple games with a modern day story.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally agree, the modern day story was a crucial part of the AC games up until they decided to make *one-story-per-game* bullshit. But as you said, Desmond was the anchor and bringing in some new character to be that anchor would be hard if not impossible unless it was done perfectly good.

Personally I would like either Desmond's dad or Desmond himself. There has been a lot of theories that Desmond survived since he had the apple of Eden. Maybe have him be seen as a Jesus character that sacrificed himself for the world and then returns. + We'd get Nolan North back so that's that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's because the modern day story was the reason AC became popular, sure not the entire reason to it but a it had a big part in it. The games wasn't just about some stuff that happened in the past but what happened in the present. From AC 1 to AC 3 we see that the point of even going into the ancestors memories is to stop the apocalypse. But when they removed the modern day (not entirely removed but shrunk it down so it basically didn't even need to be there) the games lost the part that made it *it*. I never understood the hate for the modern day story, the concept was so new and special it made the games popular and successful. 

Now it's just a story about someone centuries ago stabbing someone while occasionally having a 1st civilization tech pop up now and then. The games need a story that goes over several games like they did with Ezio, and that **includes** the modern day story for it to work. Not just *one-story-per-game* bullshit they've been doing lately. </TEXT>

The fact that they don't even have a modern day assassin story anymore kinda takes away half of what the assassin's creed games started with, it just being about assassins in the past is just plain boring.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Logitech Warranty for headset </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-13 18:48:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I bought my G930 on the 17th of March 2014, so it should be inside the 2 year warranty still right? I'm Scandinavian(Norway) if that matters.

My headset started acting up about half a year ago, from then it's only gotten worse. Up until then I had no problems whatsoever and treated it good, so no damage done by me. What it does is that it randomly turns itself off, even if it's been charging for X amount of hours. Even when it's plugged in the wire it turns itself off for no reason, only then it turns itself on again after about a second or two. If it does this about 3-5 times in a row and I take out the recharging wire it turns itself off, so I gotta hold the switch to turn it on again. I could've lived with this before but now it's gotten much more frequent and irritating, not just for me. Every time it turns itself off and on people I talk with in a Skype call hears a loud DING noise each time it goes on and off. (I know this because they have said so and I've heard the same sound coming from a friend of mine with the exact same headset.)
Now there's another problem, the right ear is barely giving any sound. I can sometimes hold it in a special angle to get anything from it. So since I'm still inside the warranty I was hoping to get a replacement since it wasn't my own fault and a technical issue. Since I couldn't find a Live Chat (since I've dealt with the BS of emailing companies like these b4) I was hoping to get help from Reddit/Logitech here.


TL;DR My headset randomly turns on and off and right ear barely got any sound coming off it, hoping to get a replacement and help from Logitech.


EDIT: I bought the headset from the Logitech store, so no other store than their own was involved. :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty sure Valve will release something in the upcoming years their last release was P2 and pretty much wrapped up Chell's story. Since Valve's main focus atm is Dota2, CS:GO and TF2 I don't think we will see a Team Fortress 3 any time soon either. What I do think though is that their next game will be Left 4 Dead 3, after they have finished/released the Source 2 engine. I still have hopes for a HL3 game, don't get why so few people don't. I mean Source 2 has been in the works for a while now and it doesn't make sense that the next Half Life game would be on the current engine. Just give it time, I'd rather have a quality game rather than a rushed one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had this on my mind for some time now and I think I've figured out how to make movies that are based of games and such, good.





The movies based of games and anime that have come out the last decade haven't been great(TLAB and that mortal combat movie), bad script, story telling, characters, etc. So I was thinking how could it be made into good movies? Look at what the upcoming Assasin's Creed movie is doing. They aren't basing it off any characters from the games or producing the same storylines, they're making completely new characters and story that is set IN the AC universe. Now I think this movie is going to be a hit and a good movie, tallented actors and is actually made by Ubisoft themself. So what I'm saying is that instead of making movies based of a game/anime, they should make movies set in the games/anime and tell a different story within those universes. Like the Avatar movie, I'm sure that if they made a movie set in the avatar universe and made completely new characters/storyline that is canon towards the series, it could work. 





TL;DR Make movies set in the games/anime universes with entirely new characters/storyline instead of basing the movies of characters we've already seen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're working on this literally right now in preparation for their new building system.

Seems like they have been working on that all the time.

you get a fcking "sphere test failed even when placing a foundation is completely possible

That's being fixed this upcoming update.

Then how come it's still happening? Couldn't build a decent entrance because of it.

I have read about it, I know what they are doing. But after almost half a year of not playing then coming back to the same old problems not being fixed yet can be irritating and give you the *why* face.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After half a year of not playing the game I finally got the urge to play again, and now I remember why I quit. The game is broken, literally. You can't make decent buildings without having to deal with the stability problem, you can't place pillars even when it's all blue color, you get a f*cking "sphere test failed even when placing a foundation is completely possible.
Before I quit I had a nice little cave base, was able to put everything everywhere when it came to building. Entrance was good shape and stable, could place a foundation literally anywhere in the cave. Good defense and good room for anything. Then an update arrived. The server restarted and generated a new map for all of us, found a new cave and started building. But guess what? We **couldn't.** Suddenly I couldn't place any foundations where it obviously were possible, normal walls couldn't be put down but I could put windows instead. Then I quit because I was pissed because I was screwed over again by the game for the last time.

Fast forward to present day, joined a server, looked far and wide for a cave and when I found one, I started building. But this time I was spammed by "sphere test failed" absolutely every time I tried to put down anything, even when it showed me it was possible. Gave up, made a rock house instead.
New house was good and stable, but for some idiotic, retarded reason the pillars were now in the middle of the foundation. I thought, ok I can maybe work with this. I built stairs on top of each other without a problem. Then the top stair broke. I used pillars to stabilize the entire house (because apparently you can put pillars normally when you get to 2nd floor) but for some reason the god damn stairs was at 7% stability. That's not the only thing, now I can't put down pillars. It's blue, it's able, but each time I put it down nothing happens. No pillar, no stability, but for some reason it steals my wood.

**Fix. This.**

TL;DR Game is so fucked up you can't build decent building anymore. Good fkn job on screwing your fanbase facepunch. -.-' </TEXT>

Bullshit. Tried soo many times to get this one foundation in place so I wouldn't have had to rebuild the entire base. Guess what facepunch, **it would not f*cking work.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> This just blew my mind, it would actually help the prequels by not even remaking them or anything.
One thing though, Jar Jar must be ancient if he would show up in TFA. I mean he's young (**like** a 30 year old) in TPM and ages through the prequel movies. No idea how old gungans can be before they die but if they did this they would have to show him off as an old, week individual.(Like they did with Yoda) And because most of the SW fanbase probably don't know of this theory and would just hate it if he was too much in the movie.

One thing that I haven't noticed being mentioned is the fact that **Jar Jar had a relationship with the Queen of [Bardotta](http://www.starwars.com/databank/bardotta).** A world which the population is known for being force sensitive, and also has a dark side to it. This was shown of a couple of [episodes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3473254/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_10) in the clone wars series, so a little info on the world. The Jedi used to take force sensitive Bardottian children into their order, because of this Bardottians branded the Jedis as kidnappers. After that the Bardottians didn't want anything to do with the Jedi, but is that the **only** reason? So how the hell does Jar Jar just happen to be the bff of a force sensitive worlds queen? **This theory makes that believable.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> The movie was both good and bad, but got allot of negative reviews and some positive. A lot of problems behind the set too.

But I think a sequel with the right director could redeem it. The cast is great, loads of good stories to take from and to just make a better movie. Think I heard that Singer was going to direct the second movie, which could be a really good choice for the franchise seeing how he did with the X.Men franchise.

I don't want another reboot with a completely new cast since the movie might not have met up to the expectations. I would rather want the same, extremely talented cast members to make a great sequel, and seeing how this movie was topping it wouldn't be that hard. Please, we don't want a new spiderman reboot incidence! D: </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think a rocksteady SUPERhero game would go well, like superman, wonder-woman, green lantern, etc. It would kinda get too OP and the character wouldn't even be in the same danger as a non superhero. That's probably why the Arkham series worked so good since it a normal guy with tons of gadgets. Think Green Arrow would fit perfectly since he's most likely already in the Arkham-verse and the game mechanics could just flow over to this. Upgrade able arrows, different kind of tech you get throughout the story. Like the DC showcase of Green Arrow would be awesome in a rocksteady game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I'd want them to cast Tobey back in the role, he was great as Spidey and much better than Garfield in my opinion. + The way they are putting Spider-man into the MCU just seems wrong and completely rushed. By using Tobey they could make a much bigger impact with the reveal of Spider-man since it's someone we've already seen through 3 movies. (We would also get back J.K.Simmons Back as J. Jonah Jameson, ain't that a reason enough..)

Also here's a link explaining more in depth why they should bring back Tobey: http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/02/28/why-marvel-should-bring-tobey-maguire-s-spider-man-into-marvel-cinematic-universe-2739119?lt_source=external,manual

<DATE> 2015-07-18 02:43:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember it vaguely from many years ago, back in the beginning of the 2000's I think (I'm only 18).

Okay so I think it was a horror/sci-fi movie. It was on a boat during a storm and on the boat there was a machine(s) that slowly took over the crew by taking their bodies and putting a robotic skeleton inside. Not like in terminator but like the flesh looked like it was literally put on, you could see parts of the body where the shoulders, elbows, neck, pelvis, etc would be robotic while the rest was normal body parts made of flesh that most likely just covered the mechanical beneath.

I remember one scene where I think (remember my memory of this movie might not be exactly how the movie goes) the captain sort of sacrifices himself or goes to where the main machine is to talk or something. I remember him standing in a dark room looking at something with a sort of almost finished robot with human parts on it being assembled/rotating, I think the room was filled with dead human parts and robot parts as well. And that's about it. As the title says I have no idea who plays in it or when its from, I could guess and say its from the 90's/early 2000's but that's it. (Well other than the captain was played by a grey bearded guy at the time.)

This is only a faint memory I've had in the back of my head for at least 10 years now and I really wanna figure out what this movie is called. </TEXT>

Personally I'd like the cast from Salvation to pop up again through the windshield, Bale did an awesome performance of John Connor and Yelchin even looks like Michael Biehn from T1 (well now atleast). + It would officially tie in TS with the franchise, and tbh Jai Courtney and Jason Clarke really didn't fit the roles in my head... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been wondering this for a while now actually, I've made some models in the PAC 3 add-on for Garry's mod but been wanting to make those models into actual models.

PAC 3 is (shortly explained) a model merger/editor, like you could shrink down bones in the upper torso of one model, then do the same with the legs of another model, bone merge those two and you got a new model with parts from both models.

The models I've built in PAC 3 has been used for Half Life 2 Roleplay characters I created, here's the result.

<TEXT> Personally I'd want a Green Arrow game where he's like in the DC Showcase (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVRiADlDEig). The character would be awesome and could be put in the arkhamverse since we've seen Queen Industries almost everywhere in the games. + they could make some awesome gear with the arrows and have sidekicks like red arrow/arsenal like they did with Robin.

My second choice is to continue the current series with Terry McGinnis. Could fit in with the end of Arkham Knight and continue on years later in Neo-Gotham with an Old Bruce Wayne helping out this new upcoming batman. Could be awesome to see both new and maybe old villains, could also expand it to a new trilogy where we get to play more and more of gotham. (The current Gotham with the Miagani, Bleak and Founders Island. The Arkham City and the Origins Gotham and lastly the Gotham we see on land and not on an island that hasn't been accessable before.) I also saw someone post an epic name for it: ***Batman: Beyond Arkham***

Would not want a Superman game though, wouldn't be the same without the use of gadgets and would be too much OP. But hey if its done right it could work but currently I wouldn't bother with it. + He does exist in the Arkhamverse, Lex Luthor, metropolis has even been mentioned and some thugs saying things like; "That'll teach him. Who the hell does he think he is anyway? Superman?" and the "You know the only thing that's missing is if that freak from Metropolis flew in here." </TEXT>

<TEXT> So after getting every riddle and beat the Riddler and every other sidequest you get the final ending with the knightfall protocol. Wayne manor blows up and Bruce obviously faked his death. What didn't make much sense to me was the stuff that happened after this, rich family that gets robbed like the Waynes and we see a Batman like figure up on a rooftop which turns into a giant bat symbol. SO could anyone explain this? Like how that could happen or is it just Batman using fear toxin? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [SPOILER] Had an idea on how season 2 will play out. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-22 18:39:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so, I recently re-watched the last 6 episodes of the first season and I think I've figured out a way everything could fit together with each other and make sense.

***SPOILER ALERT***

So when Barry goes back in time to stop Eobard (Reverse Flash) killing his mom we see his future self stopping him. Or do we? Let me explain. We got the past you Barry that gets carried away by future Barry, the one that came back to stop Eobard. Then the current Flash that we see in the series going back to safe his mom. And last we see the future Flash that's going back to stop Eobard. Also what we've gathered of information in the series we know that since that incident there have been two different timelines/universes, so who is from where? Young Barry is in both and grows up to be the flash in both timelines. The Barry that lost his mother is there. But the future Flash and Reverse Flash is from the original timeline, the one where Barry and Iris gets married and his mom lives. Eobard is also from that original timeline but crosses over to the alternate timeline when he kills Barrys mom.

So how does this fit into the next season? Well out of all this and what has happened in the series (mostly the ending) I'd say that the next season would actually start in the original timeline. But then how could the future Flash know that he should stop the current Flash to save his mom in the past? Easy, since the current Flash ran into the black hole in the sky it could perhaps patch onto the original timeline. Like how Cisco had memories of Wells killing him, everyone in the original timeline could remember what happened to the changed timeline (Barry growing up with Joe and Iris, Eddie and Iris in a relationship, Barrys father in prison, etc). So then we see how Barry in the original timeline remembers or gets memories from the alternate timeline, which then he knows he must stop alternate universe Flash to save his mom.

Further speculation on why this can happen is that Tom Cavanagh is returning to the series 2nd season. Well we saw that the original Wells died and that the Reverse flash got vaporized out of existence (Literally). So how could he return? Also easy answer, he would play the original (Not going to secretly kill you) Wells in the ORIGINAL unaltered timeline. He could get memories of how he died in the alternate one and help out the flash as actual Harrison Wells (That'd be awesome tbh). Eddie Thawne in the original timeline could also get some heavy memories of how he died/sacrificed himself.

Final thing I wanted to explain. The reverse flash return, or reappearance, or pre appearance? We could see him in the original timeline as Eobard Thawne, maybe get some back story on why he and Flash is mortal enemies other than "they just are". + We could see Matt Letscher actually play the role for more than 2 seconds. Also to add on this to make it more mind blowing, how did Eobard find out about Barrys identity? Last easy answer is that he learned it from those memories of the alternate timeline.
(They wouldn't have to get every memories from the alternate universe but just the most important (due to obvious reasons as Eobard obviously not knowing everything that would happen in the alternate universe that would happen.), aka Barrys identity, Eddies and Wells death, Barrys mom death. etc)

Give feedback on how this could or could not work in all this.

<TITLE> [Suggestion] Underwater diving gear/clothes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-04 22:30:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Title says it (mostly atleast). This could be a cool thing when dealing with base design and how you could interract with them, could bring the entire gameplay from land and into the sea.

Okay so PROS:

 - You could have an entire base underwater, make it harder to raid.

 - It would be hard to spot. (Unless they make the water transparent in the future.

 - You could live under water with the diving gear.

 - New defences could be added like a water mine or sharks(npc animals ofc)

CONS:

 - It could be REALLY hard to get to and possibly life threatening for you to get in if you don't have your gear on.

 - Furnaces wouldn't work (Obviously but perhaps a sort of airlock could make the inside of the base be full of air while the outside would be water.

 - Weapons are useless. (Unless they added something to add on weapons to make them available under water, that is if they ever plan on bringing more things to the under water levels.)


Maybe have caves under water that has airpockets in them, where the entrance is full of water and the rest is livable. Could also make it easier to raid these bases if there was a diving gear or something to breathe beneath water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've played through both the new order and got abselutely everything you could get from it, perks, collectables, achievements, everything! That was when it came out, and now that I have played through The Old Blood and gotten everything I wanted to play through The New Orders storyline again. Now I find that every extra collectibles I found is gone, deleted, can't even go into chapters as it looks like the first day I bought the damn thing.
Edit: Now a new problem is happening. I started from the beginning of the game and lasted up to when the plane crashes into Deathheads compound. The screen is black and then it crashes. Now when I re-launch the game i barely get past the Bethesda logo before it crashes. Help? ;-;
Sidenote: I built a new pc between then and now, so the game has been played on 2 computers total. Not sure if that has to do with anything. Anyway, anyone got an idea why this is? </TEXT>
