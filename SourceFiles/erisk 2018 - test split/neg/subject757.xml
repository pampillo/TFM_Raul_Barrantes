 Really? what does this even mean?

Shhh, it's "technical". The strategy is just to mumble hackers and say "you know, hacking", over and over.

Professionally speaking, it is shit. Using that as a foundation for attribution is bush league and fails to point to any actual "evidence".

<TEXT>  Yes, all biased towards stopping protests/taking away peoples rights.

These things are already crimes.

 What is to stop people from running over protesters? No consequences will spark some asshole with anger issues and he will just start mowing people down.

The bill states "exercising due care". It also adds: "A person shall not be immune from civil liability if the actions leading to the 
injury were willful or wanton."

Based on those two qualifiers I wouldn't be so quick to roll the dice with a new hood ornament as tempting as it might seem.

 You seem like the type who isn't going to change your pro establishment opinions, and i'm not changing my anti-establishment opinion, so im going to agree to disagree

Ad hominem is how it ends when you're out of things to say. It's silly to say I'm "pro-establishment", but as a normal guy that pays his taxes and wants to keep his family safe, I would prefer it that people don't create dangerous and illegal situations. 

I'm in the DC area and I'm no stranger to the protests that come through every weekend. If your top concern is being prosecuted because you wanted to be violent or destroy property then you should stay home. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  "criticial infrastructure" could be anything so no protest allowd anywere the government wants

Sure, creative classification of space is an old game that's going to get played in a variety of legal circumstances. Do you think there should be any restrictions to where protests can occur? What if it endangers the protester's life or others?

 government paid protest breakers hit people with their car and get away with it

If you're protesting by blocking a public roadway, especially a highway or interstate then you're creating a danger for yourself and other people and should be promptly removed. People that hit a protestor in a roadway can't be held liable any more than they would for someone attempting suicide the same way.

 no more anonymity for protesters to make it easy to prosecute any participant

There shouldn't be any problem with prosecution when you're not breaking the law, just like when you're not protesting. 


 paid people make a peaceful protest to a riot and everybody goes to jail

I've been involved in a peaceful protest that has turned violent. I left. At some point you decide you're not going to be involved in a riot and stop rioting.

<TEXT> Let's review just the ones they highlight as the most egregious in the article:

- Increase penalties for trespassing on criticial infrastructure including oil refineries and chemical manufacturing plants. 

- Civil immunity for the driver of an automobile who injures a protester who is blocking traffic in a public right-of-way if the driver was exercising due care. 

- Cracks down on people wearing masks or covering their faces at demonstrations.

- Increased protest penalties from class C felony to a class B felony if a riot involves 100 or more persons, doubling the maximum prison sentence to 10 years. 

Could someone point out the parts that restrict protesting please? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When we talk about global warming, or global cooling, or global climate change broadly, were not talking about science so much as political science,' wrote CFIF in a blog post. Science so far hasnt been able to say with certainty why the earths climate may be warming. Many of the computer models predicting, for example, a precipitous decline in Antarctic sea ice have been wrong.

I'm missing the part where they are "climate-denying". 

You don't have to deny climate change to not want to transfer the bulk of your wealth to a bunch of liberal retards that will blow it on [stupid scams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it possible that it's not related to pedophilia?

And for what it's worth (here come the downvotes since this pisses off both sides):

First some background: I was doing front-line investigating on the Podesta emails. I was writing scripts that did natural language processing and looking for patterns. I discovered references first hand and came to my own conclusions consistent with many other folks and they included a pedophilia angle. 

That being said, the weakest part of the entire case for me is that the "FBI" doc referenced was sourced by WL and I've not been able to corroborate it with a single source that doesn't reference that same document.

If I just had a "PSA" pamphlet from the FBI, or a case file where the symbol was mentioned then I would feel 100% more confident about everything. I've invested some time in looking but I've been unsuccessful thus far. 

Again, I'm a believer; nothing excuses the instagram, videos and art, but I would love to put this detail to rest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> | I would love to live in a Libertarian Utopia

I'm talking about fixing one profoundly broken industry, that's all. It's certainly possible and would be incredibly exciting if it happens.

 what protective measures will there be in the long run? 

Can you articulate some of the threats your concerned about? It's a bit easier to address with specifics, but I suspect the FTC will be part of the response since they manage consumer protection for all the companies that aren't telcos.

How do you quantify not trusting the Government with your data with wanting the Government to "protect" consumers? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Sounds like something out of the Galt Gulch Chile Handbook.

You're in luck! Unlike most people that talk out of their ass about topics they don't know about, this is one where I have decades of professional experience. I've worked for an ILEC, been involved in the creation and build out of two CLECs and am intimately familiar with the regulatory challenges in getting a wire to someone's house. 

Think about any of the possible services that could be provided if your company had the ability to easily pipe data to each house. If someone did want to come to your town and offer gig ethernet for $10 a month but your data would be sold in aggregate to offset the cost, would you be interested? Regardless of your response, it would not have been possible with the regulations in place.

We are in this mess because the Government got involved and created a monopoly in the first place. They have been fucking it up more ever since trying to fix it. They just need to get out of the way. Blowing fiber to someone's house really is an inexpensive and easy thing to do, but that's not the hard part.

| That's not what the government is looking for in your computer.

Lol, the Government has always had your data.

<TEXT> Since you asked, I grew up in the midwest with the idea that "gee, I hope I get my driver's license before the world ends". My grandparents walked the walk, fed me full of red meat and salt, spent an hour every morning reading the Bible to each other and praying. 

Meanwhile, to hear my single mom, accomplished musician on the 6 and 12-string guitar, flute, harp, percussion (and I wish I had any sense of rhythm) talking about burning her Moody Blue and Stones albums in the 1980s sounds like any poster to this sub today. There was nothing more evil to her than the Clintons and she would never hesitate to redpill you on the evil that we all live among.

Sadly, my beautiful blonde momma died at the age of 54. She was at the peak of her life until she faced an extended losing battle with brain cancer. I spread her ashes in the ocean. 

Meanwhile, though all this, I must always be the "smartest person in the room", continuously attempt to blue-pill my "ignorant" family for decades. Me, as the educated, self-made success story, clearly had all the answers...until you "grow-up" and realize you don't. 

The first drinks of science of taste like atheism but as you get towards the bottom of the glass you might become aware of some other forces. 

The further I go in my journey the amount of knowledge I think I have decreases. I'm now somewhere between wondering how I dress myself in the morning and protecting certain things from certain threats with expert accuracy. Life is an odd place to live.  </TEXT>

However, as a guy local to the scene, that has visited a few protests over the past few months, it seems to me that protesting by trying to interrupt legitimate business garners more bad will than good.

That's my opinion. It appears you might have a differing opinion since you imply there is some right being removed from someone else. I don't see any basis for that so I'll just assume you're responding because you're young and emotional so I hope that works out for you one day. Good luck. </TEXT>

Immediately upon release he went to see [Donald Trump](http://archive.is/gDolX) where he was either delivering a message or seeking reassurance and they haven't let him out since. 

This is happening in front of the world, for all to see, and the message is clear; there is isn't anyone that is going to stop them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I likely agree with Flynn on most politics but from someone in the business; taking money from foreign Governments under any circumstances is going to force you to change your business. 

Determining foreign influence is literally the single most important aspect of a clearance. There's no question or doubt he understood the ramifactions, tried to hide it and got fucked for being greedy. 

RT isn't even an issue, but when you write a op-ed that's pro-Erdoan then there's no question you've been doing business with the wrong team. </TEXT>

It's not hard to see the other side of the coin on this issue and with most tough issues, they are tough because both sides are right in some ways. Grandkids soften you up a bit too.

Meanwhile, if Assange gets arrested, and it's not just a ploy to get him to safer ground, while Soros, Clinton and Obama continue to wage open warfare on the state without any real action, then our story will have taken a turn and I suspect the hearts of many people will also. </TEXT>

"On 24 February, he told the crowd: Our real friends in the world speak English. The next evening he had dinner with Trump at the Washington Trump hotel and tweeted a photo of him with the Donald in the early hours of the morning.

Eleven days later, he headed off to the Ecuadorian embassy. BuzzFeeds story dropped at 1.31pm. And, 57 minutes later, at 2.28pm, WikiLeaks made an announcement: it would host a live press conference by Julian Assange about his latest leak, Vault 7."

Then one day, you realize, the herd is a lie and the dogs marching them around don't have their best interests at heart. Word spreads throughout the herd...and then...

well, that's where we are now. I'm excited to see what happens. Word is spreading and we may actually be in for a [fourth turning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory).

Word has it that your generation leads us back into another 20+ years like the 50s where everyone* gets to prosper and feel good about it.

As a security professional with multiple daughters older and younger than yours, I strongly recommend that you reconsider the personal information that you post online. I have had to provide expert testimony in multiple child harm/death cases in relation to logs and forensics showing pedophiles interacting with minors. 

edit: Took minutes to find his home address, names of kids (one of which I share and one of which my daughter shares), and that it would have been faster for me to drive over and tell him this than typing this out since I'm within a couple of miles of where he lives...until tomorrow when spring break ends and we drive back. But if someone cared, they would know where he lived, where his kids go to school, which night he's not home and a whole lot of other details that would make me very uncomfortable. He's also well armed fwiw. Good luck B.  </TEXT>

The FCC's take now is let's put everyone on the same playing field, remove the regulations that are preventing competition, make it easier to get a pipe to your house and open up the model to let you decide how you want to pay for your Internet access - "sponsored" or not and see what happens.

<TEXT>  Yeah and that's where I think there's a disconnect between security professionals and the public, we don't explain that it's basically a best guess with what we know.

If you're anything like me, you're tired of explaining. It's a complicated topic that crosses two of the most 'special' communities, netsec and IC. There are pitfalls throughout both the technical information and the ugly mix of class and unclass information. If someone has the wrong conversation with someone they might both end up needing to report to their security officer. 

 If you wanna get into some deep conspiracy theory territory I've thought what if one of the groups (both apt 28   29 were attributee's) was the CIA, and the other was Russian, so it's 

I wouldn't begin to call that a conspiracy theory; that just how it works. This world is always more complicated and subtle than anyone realizes. Or as I often find myself saying about technical incidents in hindsight, "like all good problems, there were multiple problems". </TEXT>

Agreed. In this light I have personally found it hard to accept most Red-scare type premises since the bedrock of the story usually infallible 'attribution to Cozy Bear'. It's almost like people have forgotten that other nations hack too.

From a security guy, in DC (let your imagination run wild), every mention of "Russia" turns me into that guy.

I know guys at Crowdstrike, I have read their 'report'; it's not a report. A couple of IOCs buried in 13 pages of bullshit is not a report. I create tools that automatically process thousands of IOCs per day and that's still weeks to months from any sort of attribution.

- Some sort of code with food words that is attributed to pedophilia culture, or drugs, or both.
- Mentions of Comet Ping Pong combined with above which lead to sniffing out their instagram and youtube content. 
- Content, and comments on said content, ranged from distasteful to outright disgusting including the direct mention of murdering babies.
- Plus Tony Podesta's publicly displayed pedo and death related art collection. 
- Combined with a personal invitation from Marina Abramovi, occultist to the stars, with her youtube videos that include mixing blood and semen and throwing it on stone statues. 
- Combined with decades of known conspiracies with many links drawn between. E.g., Catholic pedo, UK Gov pedo, Hollywood pedo (see pedowood).

<TEXT> If you're going to learn it, you might as well learn it the right way. You're trying to use python to interact with the command line, not interact with a database. It's like trying to learn to drive a car with hulk hands; it's less about the driving and more about the "why is he wearing hulk hands?". 

The best part is that doing it through python libraries is a whole lot easier than trying to reinvent the wheel there are tons of examples. There is a concept that you need to be aware of though and it's called a 'cursor'. You can just think of it as a session to your database.

<TEXT> You're conflating ILEC and ISP. LECs have been regulated since 1934. It wasn't until 2015 that the FCC came up with term BIAS - Broadband Internet Access Service and pulled any company that provided data under it's regulatory control.

Until this point, everyone was under the FTC's control, except LECs. Congress put them back under the FTC's control and now Congress should charge the Federal Trade Commission with enforcing clear and reasonable guidelines for protecting consumer privacy rights on the web.

 Im sorry, but what can living in a coal town teach you about whether coal is actually damaging to the atmosphere? 

 I am sure that very wonderful and deserving people benefit from mining coal. That has absolutely no bearing on the science.

The irony is strong. It's amazing to me that there are all these fancy technologies that are going to automate everyone's jobs but it's impossible for science to improve the process of coal processing.

<TEXT> I have an idea why you're saying 'hard drives', but I think that's speculation. 

The more direct path is that 'intelligence products' normally only available to the Executive Branch within a keyword sensitive program, were able to be viewed within a SCIF that had computers connected to a database in that enclave. 

As for Exec branch intelligence; you could imagine that the Secret Service generates quite a bit, but ultimately, every agency feeds up eventually, including DNI and The Corporation and at other agencies trying to get some spotlight and real estate in the premier intelligence product labeled 'Executive Branch', the President's Daily Intelligence Briefing.



And yes, they are air-gapped, at least to a particular network that isn't going to be accessible in any congressional building. The congressional office buildings are public; you can walk in just by showing an ID and walking through a magnetometer. There are some secure areas but it's very a different ball game than trying to walk into some other Federal buildings or agencies.

Your statement doesn't seem to have any evidence. 

 the US government gives 0 shits about personal privacy.

No government nor anyone else gives a shit about personal privacy anywhere in the world. This is also easily backed up with a simple search.

 It doesn't take a broadcast engineer to understand that TV networks are regulated by different rules than cable companies, nor does it take a network engineer to understand that Google as a software company is regulated differently than an ISP.

This comparison doesn't make any sense so these are all the words I have for you. For someone that wants their Internet to be unencumbered you sure seem to want a lot of regulation.

If you're super secret, you can use a fresh VM to download Tails from public wifi and then use that at other public wifi spots, with obscured physical features,  while VPNing to a proxy in a non-friendly country proxying to another proxy in a non-freindly county and then exiting via one of the many TOR nodes that are known to exist on the infrastructure at a US Gov agency.

For normal stuff I use ublock origin + clear cache/cookies on browser exit with fairly regular browser restarts. I don't use bookface or twatter and if I do come in contact with those sites, or any site that I log into, then it's a browser restart when I'm done. </TEXT>

In the one I linked, he describes how the current privacy laws are flawed since they apply to Google differently than Verizon. He states he is trying to implement a consumer privacy protection framework that is modeled after the FTC's. 

He discusses his stance on the issue including some details he felt were too technical for other folks to get so they ignored them and left loopholes and that the final implementation needs to be comprehensible by people that aren't "network engineers" (which I used to be).  </TEXT>

"Acosta acknowledged to the media in 2011 that he came under extreme pressure from Epstein's high-powered defense team, which included legal heavyweights such as Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Florida criminal defense attorney Roy Black.

"Acosta said Epstein's defense mounted "a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors."

"I use the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered," the former U.S. attorney wrote. He said his office stuck to its opening position in the case, but he also acknowledged that the ultimate punishment in the case may have been more lenient than Epstein deserved."

Beyond that, as literally the most powerful person on the planet, he has an infinite number of buttons to push to shape the narrative. He could choose to declassify anything from JFK to Roswell and shape the conversation in literally any way that he chooses. For some reason, this is the choice for this narrative.

<TEXT> I was really wrapped around the axle about the Israel stuff too. Got myself banned from T_D for months for implying ALL Jews don't walk on water and made a few statements similar to your own about which country should be put first.

I think the false choice presented is that you're either pro-Israel or anti-Israel and to not have a position defaults to anti-Israel. I'm open to hearing other perspectives, but from mine, here in DC, working in the mix of it, I'm unable to find an exception to this.

Therefore, in my own best interest, if I must choose a side, I will grudgingly acknowledge that Islam conquering Israel would be a pretty catastrophic event in history that I would prefer to not see.

Being honest, it doesn't matter what my opinion is, especially when it might change, and it won't affect the outcome of events. Just my $.02 from my perspective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cannot disagree with this. I regularly remind people that he was very critical of Obama for announcing his plans ahead of time. 

Beyond that, I have a theory that what people call "4D Chess" is really his own way of a building a Rube Goldberg of events to lead to the unveiling of information. This is due to the combination of a few different factors including control, grandeur and probably some  weird sense of destiny. It's hard to imagine what it would feel like after living his life but I feel like this is the game that he plays; each one more elaborate than the last. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not news. He has always quite plainly said he would be enabling Israel to achieve a single state solution. His son-in-law and daughter are Orthodox Jews and the Kunsher's dad is a Holocaust survivor; there was never any question that Trump would be kicking off the 10th Crusade and there's going to be some glass parking lots before he's done. 

If you want to have some fun, look up the word 'mosiach' and wrap your mind around the idea that there are people that believe he's going to enable the Jewish Messiah which will usher in a 1000 years of Jewish  rule.

I think there are plausible theories for wanting to avoid beheading, but they may all be staged given the propaganda budget allocated for propaganda (they never said who the propaganda was for), but until I get some good evidence that all the ISIS videos are staged by the US, I'm going to go with the theory that many people, regardless of political affiliation, are going to avoid people that want to cut their heads off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So your argument is that "conservatives", in which I think it's safe to say that you disagree with, are  "worthless shills" or "religious cultists"?

edit: We stop raising kids as fascists and encouraging them to think that as long as they *think* they are "right", it's okay for them to stop others from speaking.

The ultimate flaw in this strategy is that youth is the opposite of experience and often they lack the skills to look at a complex situation from multiple angles which would lead to a different conclusion about what is "right".

<TEXT> I perceive both situations very differently than you. The first one isn't homeless hate, it's random dude that poo'ed in my sink hate. It's not definitive that he's even homeless for that matter.

The second one is practical and legal common sense. Most people don't dispute the business owner's perspective that the entry to his business must be maintained to a certain standard lest it put his business at risk. 

Neither anecdotal story conveys a trend of "hate" nor includes considerations such as the availability of homeless services or the level of crime in an area that may lead you to view circumstances differently. 

There really are an infinite number of perspectives out there and even though it may not be readily apparent, most of them are defensible in their own unique circumstances. 

Right and wrong are a bit harder to define when in many cases opposing sides of an issue are both right and wrong in some  aspects. </TEXT>

"Despite the public outcry, purchasing acid is still not difficult.

In Dhaka, sulphuric acid can be readily purchased for just 44 US cents a pound (roughly half a litre), with nitric acid slightly higher at 59 cents a pound.

You just ask the traders for acid. They will provide you with the required quantity, Gopal Das, a goldsmith in the citys Tantibazar area, said.

Gopal uses nitric acid to melt gold. Since he only needs a very small amount he has never bothered to obtain the now mandatory license." </TEXT>

But how do we know this without the doc? 

Do you know anyone that admits to being a pedophile? Do they use this symbol? 

Have you ever seen a pedo ring bust? Did the evidence include this symbol anywhere? 

Has there ever been a reference on a website? It's not on NAMBLA's. 

This doesn't speak to the sick instagram posts, twisted videos and other compelling data points, but if the symbols are that ubiquitous than I don't think it's unreasonable to find a single document in addition to what we have to corroborate the evidence. My search continues. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  No your not. Your shilling. 

Clearly. You can see from my post history I am a hard core shill. 

I have no problem finding the symbol. Finding the symbol on a quarter isn't the same as a source from a law enforcement agency. The only source we have came from a single document WL released 10 years ago. 

There hasn't been another document with the same info available since then? Not one I'm able to find.

Take a second look at your google search; every triangle reference is directly from the doc, the rest of images are pics of logos that have incorporated something similar but most are probably coincidental. 

No one wants to see people arrested more than me but I'm rather surprised at the hostility for trying to trying to find additional evidence towards something we both agree on.  </TEXT>

 - Define "there" please?
 - What exploit did they use to 'break in'?
 - How and where were the emails exfiltrated?
 - Was anything else exfiltrated?
 - Where is the investigation report with the forensic details showing IOCs and TTPs which would be used for attribution?

He might say 'the server' on the first one but he has no chance on the others since the info doesn't exist, at least not publicly.  </TEXT>

He always told Obama he was an idiot for announcing his offensive plans and he has thus far stuck to trying to accomplish things in the background and announcing progress. He's trying to turn an aircraft carrier right now though so he's a little busy.

It's like that dad that can never quite bear to tell his kids where he's taking them, it's always has to be a fucking 'surprise', even if it's the Sizzler.

I agree and perhaps I could have phrased it better. What is the first milestone that will indicate to you that you're really on the right path? Is there any particular thing that might turn you off the Trump=Russia path? 

I certainly welcome any new evidence/leaks on Trump+Russia. The well has been dry, and for a lot of us, it looks pretty desperate. I'm looking at it through the same lens as any injustice that involves humans fucking over other humans. 

This means that sources can't name 'unnamed' and all compiled with authors that display various levels of mental illness due to perceived injustices but not a whole lot of facts. 

There is a whole lot of evidence for internal destabilization though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps it's part of the propaganda, but it may be a factor that some perceive communism as more economic than social. 

Words mean different things at different times to different people. People choose certain words to try to convey an idea that the words are associated with. I don't think communists have a monopoly on oppressing dissent so if I can evoke imagery of an intolerant group oppressing ideas they don't agree with by using the word 'fascism', then I accomplished my goal. 

If my goal were to try to normalize the word 'fascism' to something other than a pejorative then I'm afraid my goal would never be accomplished. 

Regardless, you present an interesting point of view that I had not considered before which is why I hang out here. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The reality is that the Communist movement was the movment that had to suppress all opposition ideas, required violence, was openly totalitarian, and wanted a state that controlled every aspect of life.

Are you stating that these characteristics are not also true of fascism? 

Is the propaganda that fascism has similar characteristics to communism but most people use 'fascism' as a catch-all leaving communism unscathed? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why not just call this what it is? Communist.

I don't care what you call it. 

  people like you

Busted! I was laying a careful maze of linguistic deception but you found me out! You are double-plus good!

Now that the truth is on the table, I can elaborate to say that I find the suppression of ideas by an opposition group, even if it requires violence, to smack of totalitarianism, which I believe is a core tenet of fascism. 

If we can agree that totalitarians require a continuously growing government to achieve their ultimate goal of an all powerful state that will come wipe their ass for them then you can probably see the leap to fascism is a small jump.

I consider communism to be more of an economic philosophy, but similar to fascism, at some point you need to quiet the detractors to pull it off so you get back to the same totalitarian themes.

<TEXT> Looks like they beat him; he was outnumbered, and they won. From another article, with some familiar names in the pedo defense brigade.

"Acosta acknowledged to the media in 2011 that he came under extreme pressure from Epstein's high-powered defense team, which included legal heavyweights such as Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Florida criminal defense attorney Roy Black.

"Acosta said Epstein's defense mounted "a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors."

"I use the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered," the former U.S. attorney wrote. He said his office stuck to its opening position in the case, but he also acknowledged that the ultimate punishment in the case may have been more lenient than Epstein deserved."

Just like Comey; sometimes you lose, but years later, you might have a chance to make things right.

If I was less suspicious, he biggest challenge would have been jetlag, but in this case, I think he received some information in Russia; something that really bothered him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's look deeper. We'll start with the author, Natasha Bertrand. Fortunately she's a prolific [twatterer](https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand)  so no lack of information. She's shows herself to be a hard core anti-Trumper and mentions every bit of negative Trump information, true or not, that comes her way. Seems obsessed with the Russia angle. 

At least we know where we're starting from. Let's continue.

The source her article is another article written by "Adrian Chen" for the NYT in June 2015. Who is [Adrian Chen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Chen)?

Oh, yeah, this guy: 

"In October 2012, Chen exposed the real name and details of Violentacrez (a moderator of several Reddit Jailbait communities), a Texas Internet developer, who was subsequently fired from his job. This led to all links to Gawker being temporarily banned from Reddit. In September 2012, Chen acquiesced to demands from Anonymous and posted images of himself dressed in a tutu with a shoe perched on his head. The images had been demanded in exchange for interviews regarding an alleged leak of Apple iPhone and iPad user data from an FBI laptop."

[Shocker, another anti-Trumper obsessed with Russia](https://twitter.com/AdrianChen).

Let's read the [source article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html)...

Actually, don't. I read it it and I'll save you the time. Chen tells a story about chasing around twatter trolls in 2014 and fills in the blanks with Russian conjecture. It's a horrible LARP that can't be independently verified.

How about the [second source](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-171-adrian-chen). It's a podcast where he drops the single line the entire article is based on "I don't know what's going on, but they're all tweeting about Donald Trump and stuff".

Now we know we are are dealing with. Let's refer back to the first "article". Mentions a few more "articles" as sources, Russia, Russia Russia. Tries to create a narrative by stringing together unsubstantiated and unrelated claims and look, now Putin's on a horse.

Sometimes I wonder if there is actually a memo somewhere that says "the strategy is to just keep associating Trump with Russia to continue our resistance against the administration".  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  what makes it look like a coordinated hit job?

Probably not the response you're expecting, but...

I have written scripts to create news feeds for myself that are curated by particular topics. I use scoring and weighting to arrange topics and turn it into a visualization. This let's me efficiently consume a great deal of information and shows data that is statistically unique or outlying from the other data. Some of the things considered are source, author, number of hits on google, number of hits on reddit, and a few other sites, etc...

Anyway, this topic looks like it hit multiple entry points at about the same time and shares some other characteristics with other topics I would consider coordinated. </TEXT>

It's fucked up if he was abused as a child and it's fucked up that he said that shit. This looks like a coordinated hit job which makes me wonder about the source. I'll need to do some research.

<TEXT> You seem to really get worked up about this for a Russian guy. 

Currently his actions don't fit that narrative and you're going to have a hard time selling it until they do. In fact, I'll put forward that he could be a Russian puppet that's enriching himself on the side but so long as it's being spread around America, many would be just fine with that. 

People have a problem when the elites get greedy and even more so when they invite all their shitty friends over from other countries to the party, pass all kinds of rules that don't apply to them and start being shitty to the people paying for the party.

After that happens, people want the opposite of that for awhile. 

I've been asking for days for someone to paint me a narrative of the dark days under Trump. I would love to know what folks think this is going to look like in 2 or 4 years. </TEXT>

It's an interesting problem to have when every action you take directly and indirectly changes the fortunes of others as there will always be reactions from both sides regardless of the initial intent.

That being said, I consider him aligned with Israel on most every point and I expect him to help them kick off the 10th Crusade. </TEXT>

There are many people that used be much more liberal until they started following the "sources" back for the media. After seeing the patterns in messaging, understanding who was ultimately funding that messaging and their motives, some people reject the MSM and continue to examine their information input carefully regardless of source. This in contrast to the "echo chambers" we heard about recently. </TEXT>

The 3rd separate issue conflated is the White House being infested with subversive treasonists that need to be rooted out and prosecuted. You signed the paper, you passed many men with guns on your way into work, you know the deal.

<TEXT> This is a truly unique time in American history. The number of people that have seen the man behind the curtain in recently is historic. It's this sort of mass awareness that leads to revolutions and political change like we are seeing now.

I think Nixon was the last time it became public spy vs. spy and then operated as usual with small hiccups (Iran Contra, Lewinsky, Iraqx2, etc..) for the past nearly 40 years and now it appears that it's time for a change. That's as far back as my visibility goes first hand.

In my opinion, people are logical coming to some obvious conclusions for the first time in their lives. They are realizing that wars aren't being fought for freedom or justice and they are just rats in a wheel with very little chance of ever getting off. They are realizing that reality doesn't have to be what those in power tell you it is. Every single person on this earth is just a bag of meat. No bag of meat is quite like another but they are all stuck in basically the same fridge. There are always some number of bags of meat that tell the other bags of meat how they need to live their meaty little lives.

Eventually you reach an age where you are comfortable with your belief system and the moral justification that you maintain to support that. After that happens, when you hear bags of meat telling others how to live, it is plainly obvious that they are just as clueless as you've ever been. They don't have any secret knowledge nor do they prioritize the things that you value the same...e.g., they don't value your kid in the same way you do, and by definition nearly every person is going to live their life with different and competing priorities. You might come to realize that the bags of meat telling others how to live are often the ones that require the most assistance coming to terms with reality.

From there folks started to seek out and find their own truth. Instead of reading a biased article, they scan it for the source, read it themselves and make up their own minds...or as is often the case, realize there is no source. Then people start to see patterns. They see the same words in their headlines "chaos", "dark times ahead", they see bags of meat on TV claiming that they know best and finally this rings out like the warning alarm that so many others still miss.

Then the journey begins; constantly seeking truth, looking for the real story while your own foundation of knowledge grows deeper and more secure ultimately leading to a better society.  </TEXT>

 "One problem with the Atlantic Council letter is that it omits individual contributors, which were specifically requested," the aide said.

"We have no idea if funds came through individuals from foreign nations that could create conflicts of interest," the GOP aide said. "He doesnt have a right to keep such potential conflicts hidden." 

Let's dig into "Atlantic Council" a bit more...see if there might be a pattern here...

Members include anti-Israel pieces like [A Middle East Agenda for Hillary Clinton](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/a-middle-east-agenda-for-hillary-clinton).

And keep looking...Ahh, here we are, ["Thank You, George!"](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/thank-you-george)...bet you can guess who "George" is on the first try...

<TEXT>  I could be wrong, but I don't recall Gonzales, Ashcroft, or Reno being called racist/sexist.

Cool, but that doesn't invalidate my point.

 It's not apples to apples. The transition team didn't have their shit together at all with the disclosures required by the ethics committee.

Fake news. Forms were in within hours. That is clearly not was is causing the delay as Dems publically and dramatically drag every possible window to the max the law allows; again not because it will make a difference, but only to appear as a literal impedance to the progress of anyone that wants it.

 Trumps ideas and some of the people he's choosing to enact them are fairly radical compared to the mainstream politics of the past (that's what got him elected), so of course there's going to be a lot of resistance. I actually think it's healthy. Why have hearings at all if they're just going to get a rubber stamp?

They disagree with administration by definition. We get it. They literally don't have the votes to stop it, so, yep, might as well rubber stamp since we literally can't do anything else except whine at a cost of literally millions of dollars per day in lost productivity. 

 I'll re-phrase. Do you think it's possible that there are pro-trump factions flooding these communities with the idea that sessions alone can bring us justice here, to increase public support for his nomination getting passed?

"These communities" are being flooded by bots and propaganda from both sides...and it doesn't matter. We aren't voting and we aren't making the laws. We're just addicted to trying to shape and control the smallest sliver of the world that we might be able to control...our information bubble.

<TEXT>  I believe you're right that the left would fight any pick, but they will fight especially hard against a pick that appears to fit the "racism" narrative. I don't want to get into the "republicans are right democrats are wrong" type of discourse.

Every choice would have fit a racism or sexism angle. Few folks are accused of racism or sexual assault until they run against Democrats. See Trump, Huckabee, Thomas, etc...old tricks are old.


 Republicans were equally as oppositional, and I'd say more so, with the backing of tea party conservatives , when Obama came into office. Both parties put forward "deals" (aka legislation) that intentionally include provisions and riders that are unpalatable to the other side. That way they can say, "see? they can't agree to anything we propose!" 

You can say that, but the simple truth is that the Democrats have turned this into the longest cabinet approval process in history. Literally every single cabinet had been approved by the President's fouth week.


 What do you think makes him the best man in Trump's eyes? This is the heart of my question. 

Trump has stated this.

 And a follow up: do you believe it's plausible that the "Sessions is the key" narrative is just a little too politically convenient? I'm not here to bicker, I'm asking genuinely.

I'm not sure what this means.

Imagine how suave these people could be if they were skilled at their jobs. They could negotiate deals that had winning aspects for both sides while looking like mature informed adults.

 "Things Will Get Worse Until US Stops Lying About Crimea"

What "things"? How will they get worse? This is the premise the headline promises.

  Russia seized Crimea narratives  become acknowledged to be lies

What? I didn't realize this was up for debate It's not like another country that wasn't Russia annexed Crimea.  [Here is Putin on video stating](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31796226):

"I invited the leaders of our special services and the defence ministry to the Kremlin and set them the task of saving the life of the president of Ukraine, who would simply have been liquidated," he said.

"We finished about seven in the morning. When we were parting, I told all my colleagues, 'We are forced to begin the work to bring Crimea back into Russia'." 

Another video where Putin addresses it in the first question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0stuDpk318

 Anyone who is closed-minded to the possibility that the U.S. is lying and that Russia is telling the truth about the relationship between the two countries, would therefore be simply wasting time to read here, because the solid documentation that will be provided here will prove that thats not only a possibility; it is the fact, and those widespread false beliefs will, indeed, be disproven here.

I guess we're done "here" then since "solid documentation" is not provided "here" as he indicates. He rambles on for a good bit longer and I almost read  it all but his point is so detached from any other sources, including his own, that it's tough to follow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crusade.

If you're watching the nature channel and you see two groups of animals fighting with each other, let's say elephants and lions, why are they fighting? Is it for survival or do you think the elephants are racist against the lions or vice versa?  Should one side win over the other? Is there a moral question? Do you think there is there evil in it? Which group has the 'right' to live the way they choose?

What will be the reality for the winner/loser regardless of what you think?

Take the thing that pisses you off the most; the backwoods American, racist, intolerant, religious fanatic that you know Russia manipulated to get Trump elected, and add a flair for creative homicide of everyone that they disagree with and might start to appreciate the mindset of the people that live only to see Jewish genocide.

This is the sort of thing that no one can tell you though. You have to look at evidence, read a little history and come to your own conclusions. When you realize this is the same story has been reoccurring the past 14 centuries, you can read ahead and see how it ends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. While I lean right, I hate seeing every Trump headline posted here. The only Trump related conspiracies we should be seeing relate to pizzag8, actual Russia evidence (the Flynn investigation is notable, until it isn't), or him starting the 10th Crusade as predicted by Jewish mysticism, or maybe the lawsuit that David Brock just filed.

Nothing about Obamacare or a pussy parade or a press conference or inauguration numbers or what some talking head is spewing; just evidence of the TPTB and the real war happening out of the public eye. </TEXT>

It was the second time I had taken my family to Europe this year but we cut the first one short when we were in town for the Brussels bombings and I guess we were fortunate to be at a Munich Christkindlmarket instead of one in Berlin on that day.

<TEXT>  This is where I'm going to have disagree with you. The overwhelming majority of Muslims (excl. the minority of extremists) do not wish for the 'extermination' of Israel and its people as is often implied, rather consider the legitimacy of its existence as a sovereign nation to be illegitimate. 

I think you're splitting hairs, the end result is the same. Can't really end their country without ending their tribe at this point.

  signal the final nail in the coffin for any hope of a two-state solution or perhaps even the survival of Palestinians in general, and one that would undoubtedly ignite conflict between Israeli and a number of their Arab neighbors

As someone in DC, who knows some insiders, most of the positions are ready to be filled, and the insiders are none too happy. To quote one of them, who used to be an attorney for the RNC; "they are hiring a bunch of millennial and generally clueless people that have no idea how things work here". That particular person had sent in a resume and is still part of the process. 

My hearsay is still more accurate and useful the hack trying to write a scare article around the single fact that yes, ambassadors are changed out with every President. 

It's not the current administration's fault they were too clueless to realize they were about to be out of a job and take proper preparations but that isn't going to stop a pile of entitled people that have been living off the Government's teet from whining about it. </TEXT>

It's not easy to convert to Judaism. You need to find a rabbi and demonstrate a sincere commitment to Jewish beliefs and law. The rules says he must talk you out of it and reject you forcefully 3 times (fight club style?), go before a panel, convince them that you're living Jewish and then you can be converted, but even then, not all Jews will recognize you. 

So you basically have to live as a Jew for a ~year, meaning multiple events per week with the same people, actively upholding Jewish law and basically convince them that you are one of them.  </TEXT>

edit: I'm happy this got posted. Shows people have been taking their own red pills for a long time. There is no other group in America that has had structured, Government and corporate funded attacks than blacks. From crack to abortion to Tuskegee to Jim Crow...the people have been under attack since the beginning. One of the biggest conspiracies ever known to be absolutely true. 

I think that the redpill for a lot of folks, regardless of race or nationality, is realizing they are under a constant attack from ideological people. I think the biggest driver of redpills this year was realizing the source of the attack was the MSM (and their puppeteers). It's good to hear other folks stories who have already been walking this path so you can learn tips for how to keep yourself sane and how to keep  yourself on the path of truth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone doesn't understand technology. There are servers in some of the most secure locations in the world, with all of the content, those servers will ever talk to a single server at a time, and if anyone ever attempts to log into that server, it will automatically destroy itself. 

That server proxies content to other servers in which someone can pay to Remote Desktop into and then browse the content. The content never touches their own computer, is never seen communicating with the machine they are using and the dots are unconnectable. Technology will always win...but people make mistakes...then what?

I'm truly overwhelmed by the pedo problem I've recently become aware of. It's even more unfortunate that the parents are often the worst offenders and 1/3 of the offenders are juvenile themselves.

This is a real issue without a simple fix. Some percentage of the population is pre-dispositioned to cause harm to those that cannot defend themselves. It has always been that way and always will be.

We can't round them all up and kill them, technology will always provide a semi-safe haven for them and the sick parents will always push the envelop forward in the abuse of their own children.

I've seen a universal 3-strike program suggested before; first, it's half-your-age+7 across the board. Then it's first strike, jail, rehab, restitution, etc...second strike, castration, 3rd strike, outta here, fast track, no appeals, string them up that day.

It provides a clear deterrent, takes steps to work with the the offender, and pragmatic justice when the person cannot be helped sufficiently to live with other humans.

<TEXT> Everyone's got to start somewhere. I too remember what it was like to simply accept globalism as the obvious future, but I was doing this without real examination. 

There are common phases that people go through. One of the first is to start digging into the sources for your information. As an example, you see a headline that says "Republicans gut ethics committee because they are evil"... you can stop reading right there. You already know what it says. Your next search is to find said bill and actually read it. Once you read it, you can learn who was behind it and quite often, they will have said publicly exactly what and why they were doing. Yep, sometimes they'll just come right and say it...and it might even make sense given the circumstances they were facing. 

But maybe they don't just come right out and say it. But know that nothing happens accidentally; things only happen because someone wants them to happen and is applying force in such a way that they do happen. So you need to dig a little deeper, maybe into some "alternative news" sites, forums, etc... and examine the information that you find there. Any obvious theories on the real back story? 

Maybe, maybe not. Regardless, at this point, you, informed human, can come to your own conclusion on the event that occurred and if you do this for long enough, you will start to see patterns... and they aren't down party lines.

Good luck on your journey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In WoW, you have two sides, Alliance and Horde, that cannot talk to each other in game but can understand players on their own side. When you /say or /yell something, it's visible to everyone though so when someone from the opposite side saw the words it would come across with a subtitle of the language and converted to "gibberish", e.g.,

[Player 1 - Horde] Gonna kick some ass!

might be seen as:

[Player -1] [Orcish] Lok-Narash Nogah Kagg Gul!

Anyway, the entire point is that when a Horde player typed "KEK", the Alliance player saw "LOL". 

KEK=LOL

Then KEK begins to just be used in place of LOL on 4chan and other places and then eventually ascends to be a God...presumably where /u/Jack41096's response kicks in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. This seems to have become a partisan issue for an ambitious prosecutor. 

Here's the [original law](http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/647.html). The [bill](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1322) makes more sense in context. 

Now that we are just dealing with the facts, please tell me how convicting victimized children for the crimes of their pimps and giving them criminal records is supposed to help them.

Nothing is stopping the police from picking up an unaccompanied minor an putting them into the system (where they are likely to be abused again, but that's a separate problem). This only removes the misdemeanor from the minor and I fail to see how that is a bad thing.

I'm a frontline pizzagater and I want to see the pedo's hang...victimizing victims isn't on the agenda. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I absolutely know of the allegations. I do appreciate your thoughtful reply also. Unfortunately, linking Snopes isn't going to bolster the story. 

The claims lay with all the others the democrats threw at him that all magically disappeared after the election. The smarmy lawyer knew she was risking her license by pushing too hard and is dangerously close to libel so she pulled everything back. 

As the hearsay goes, Epstain was also banned from Mar-a-Lago once Trump realized he was an actual pedo. So without more, we got nothing except rehashing the same tired story that lacks evidence and a victim.

<TEXT> It wouldn't be American, but I'm tempted to suggest let the parents decide. 

Unfortunately, the parent is often the worst offender. Also tough when 1/3 of the offenders are juvenile themselves. 

This is a real issue without a simple fix. Some percentage of the population is pre-dispositioned to cause harm to those that cannot defend themselves. It has always been that way and always will be. 

We can't round them all up and kill them, technology will always provide a semi-safe haven for them and the sick parents will always push the envelop forward in the abuse of their own children.

Maybe an fast-track death penalty is the best deterrent given our lack of options to deal with, or even understand the problem.

If my 6th grader was doing a book report, I would be okay with this work. Meanwhile, the primary source for the article, Washington Post, uses two Washington Post "articles" as sources for the article, which continue to just source more Washington Post articles as their sources until we get to:  
"a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators" as the root source, which is no source at all. 

This is literally one story with no evidence and no new updates that continues to get reposted over and over and over again.
