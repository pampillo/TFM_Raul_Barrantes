<TEXT> so here i am re building my happy birthday trap at midnight, when i hear a soft song from a female cannibal. not the usual AH AH! into the night calling for reinforcements but instead something that actually sounded like a song. i dare not follow her, as my main concern was rebuilding the happy birthday. the next morning i found 2 effigies added around my base. just curious if anyone has heard her before. i have been wearing red paint for 2 nights now and my sanity is still at 74%. </TEXT>

<TEXT> serious time, having a S85 loaner for nearly three weeks i can tell you that all non performance model S are just about as fast at speeds over 30. the P cars shine in sub 30 kick. having watched all the PxxD car drama that tesla has been pulling since they were created has left a lot of us P car owners saying if we knew what we know now we would have not gotten a PxxD. as in not the performance car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> owners were logging 480-512kw last year. after the 8.0 update someone was kicked down to under ~450kw in max battery mode. so... not a p90d. he raised a stink and found out launch mode, max battery and WOT counters limiting performance. which tesla removed, only to shift that max output into launch mode. later learned not to protect some mechanical piece like and axle or something but because the battery cells were being damaged. case in point my car which needed a new pack in under 1 year without frequent use of max batt or launch mode. just normal ludicrous mode acceleration so about 460kw. </TEXT>

<TEXT> first off, dashcams often have a crap lens or a dirty lens. so that footage does not mean anything. as u/EducationalPorpoises pointed out, most other cameras will clip and not bloom out the sun. lastly only reason i have had AP1 act up when driving into the sun is when the angle of incidence is so that the asphalt is reflecting the sun thus making the lane markers hard to read. </TEXT>

<TEXT> for 19 miles of my 25 mile drive to work the system works flawlessly. i am much more happy when i arrive to work and i am much less endangering myself with my own leadfoot.

 nbsp;
when the wife and i ordered the car i had no intention of adding autopilot, but she really wanted it so ok then...   on delivery day i enabled AP for the first time and it was a white knuckle situation. was afraid the car would not turn for that curve, would not brake for that car, would not see the jerkhole that cut in front of me. turned out it could handle all those situations better then i would. the car does not get frustrated and is not susceptible to road rage. the more you use AP on a drive to work the more enlightened you get. i have far less anger when it comes to other drivers, because i can use my newly freed up brainpower to analyze there actions more. i also have less of a "in a rush" feeling to get where ever it is i am going. 

 nbsp;
re: mistakes, never. not at all. maybe its my route but in the 8 month history of my car the only time i ever saw AP totally fuck up a situation was an off ramp that has little to no markings and makes a 270* change of direction with a radius of 120 ft. back in the early days of AP there were 2 spots on the 210 freeway where the car appeared like it was just going to drive into the center divider on a curve, but later i learned it just took them WAY late. 1 software update fixed that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> just like any car, its sucked into the filter and on to the blower motor where it escapes into the cabin again. unless one has the outside air mode turned on, then the car builds positive pressure and "generally" exits out a little rubber flap in the rear bumper.

but bioweapon mode should just be filtering the air in the car only. </TEXT>

<TEXT> unfortunately i dont have my HOV tags yet so i cannot comment on the car pool lanes specifically. after driving for several weeks with ap on i have noticed the only parts the car makes my more alert is the sections of curving, dipping, concrete expansion joint sections.

for instance this section of the 5 north:
https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1745477,-118.3067847,19z/data=!3m1!1e3

and the 210 east:
https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1508515,-118.1533087,18z/data=!3m1!1e3

i dont know what it is about these sections. but every day the car waits until the last possible moment to start turning. unsettling if there are other cars on either side.

might be the concrete pavement does not work as well as asphalt? 

everywhere else it works fantastically. im not even bothered by the fact i dont have HOV tags yet, as if there is any traffic the autopilot just does its thing and i just gaze out the window. stress free the way to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i dont actually own it yet, have to wait 2 more weeks but...  yes. by a wide, wide margin.

i could buy my previous commuter car 7 times, and outright buy my current lease cars 4 times over.

my previous commuter car was a mazda miata. which had a just ok interior. my fiat 500e had, in comparison, a much nicer interior. so that got me on the "nice interiors are nice" train. so i started to think about more expensive cars. and then well... i became a chump and ordered 5 options away from the most expensive vehicle tesla currently makes.    sigh...   hindsight is a bitch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> a few months ago i found a 3-4 inch hole in my front yard here in los angeles. at the time i thought it was a rodent hole of some sort so i proceed to fill it with sand and yard waste from around the area. about two weeks ago i was in the front yard and saw the hole had reappeared. so once again i filled it, this time with water to drown out whatever may have made it. then i grabbed a bunch of mulch / potting soil and filled in the hole with the water.

the next day the area was very soft and gave way under foot pressure. i though... oh shit... its a sinkhole. had the sewer line inspected, everything ok. tested the waterline today, seems like i dont have a leak.

decided to excavate the area and found under the root layer was a 3-4 inch deep layer of potting soil complete with little white stones. the small hole was softer than the surrounding dirt.   i have no idea what this is... or who to call to fix it.   any ideas from here?

another view shoving my cell phone in the hole.

<TEXT> i ditched my gas car long ago, so currently i am only paying $200 a month for a fiat ev lease + like $30 in electricity for 2 evs. we have gotten rid of most of our debt for some time now, so other than mortgage and property tax everything went to the car fund. it was really only possible for me because my wife loved the model s as much as i do, so i had her help religiously saving. when i say religiously i mean not going anywhere, movies, out to eat, nothing. plus i had the opportunity to do crazy amounts of overtime for the beginning of 2015. by October were were at the 85D. tried to get as much overtime as i could for the rest of the year to get an ok equipped P85D.

sadly my uncle passed away in december and named me in his will so that covered the last 10k for the P90DL. 

as far as the "fuck it, im doing it" the wife was sold on the model s 60kw several years ago. but she could not swing the funds. i offered to give her a loan for the rest. time passed and i started researching more and more about the car. i told her we should be getting the S85 if im helping. test drove, fell for it hard. we were invited to the D reveal event and i was blown away by the P85D, prior to that i was not interested in the P85.

So now that i wanted the P85D the tables turned and the wife was giving me a 50% S85D loan and i would cover the rest. so...   basically i stole her dream  :D

we were not at all interested in a car payment. we agreed to just wait until the savings matched the price. </TEXT>

<TEXT> hello, just found this sub reddit.  ive been mulling over a custom decal for my car. the only interesting place i could think of for it would be smack in the center of the high mount 3rd brake light on my rear window. the decal would be about 3", the brake light is about 7-8." from what i have read you can pretty much do anything with your rear window... but was wondering about the brake light part.

<TEXT> hello everyone, the other day i was launching missions to clamp onto orbiting debris to deorbit them when i remembered Romfarer Lazor System. went to the mod thread and was sad to see it was very out of date. does anyone have a suggestion for lazer mods for blowing up debris? any other mod that could serve that purpose? 

i am fully aware i can just delete them...  but that does not feel right. got to put at least one kerbals life in danger... </TEXT>
