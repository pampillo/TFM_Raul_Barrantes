<TEXT> This season has definitely had it's ups and downs (quite a few downs unfortunately), but I've always been happy with the series as a whole. 

Tonight's episode though was just so absolutely terrific, bringing together plot threads from multiple arcs this season (and even one loose thread from Legends). I just loved it so damn much.

I suppose that makes this a "favorite episodes" post, but whatever. Just needed to get it out there. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Max Headroom Incident </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 03:56:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My father worked for many years as a segment producer for Chicago's WGN-TV's Nine O'Clock News during the 80's and some of the 90's. Of course he has all sorts of stories, some of them quite funny. Most of them I heard quite often growing up, like the one about the drunk newsman who couldn't read the teleprompter or that time their field reporter wouldn't stop cursing because he thought the mic was broken (it wasn't).

I loved these stories. They were like hearing about a real life Ron Burgandy and his crew. But there was one story he would never speak about. My twin brother and I weren't even born when it happened, so obviously I don't remember it at all. But years later when we were at a Christmas Eve party for the station, somebody got drunk at the bar and started shouting over and over and it turned into quite the commotion.

He was shouting about The Max Headroom Incident.

Sure, I was only 8 at the time of the party, but I had never seen a room full of jovial, drunk professionals get quiet so fast. Even after the crowd completely dialed down, the guy kept shouting at the bar. He even sounded angry and his eyes had begun to tear up.

"Tell 'em! Tell 'em Al, tell 'em what happened!"

Al was my father and it took me quite some time to even realize that was who the man was addressing. In an instant, my father looked exhausted, his usually dark, gaunt eyes looking even more tired and deep set than usual.

As the crowd watched without saying a word, my father gathered up me, my brother and my mom and slowly walked out of the building. The ride home was eerily quiet as the snow drifted over the city. Years and years later, I found out the drunk guy at the bar was fired the day after Christmas and never heard from again.

To be honest, after that incident, I never really thought about it again (a heaping pile of presents with a brand new N64 nestled in the middle the following morning certainly helped). But recently, my father's health hasn't been too hot and so these old stories about the station have become and more and more treasured as his memory began to falter.

My brother and I came home for Thanksgiving dinner and he was telling his usual, favorite story (the cursing newsman) when suddenly his eyes went wide and he began to mutter under his breath.

"...he didn't get fired for that, funny enough... he didn't get fired until after Christmas..."

And then it all came flooding back, the memory of that Christmas party having been blocked by hours of Shadows of the Empire and Mario 64 the following morning.

My mother suddenly looked very concerned as she took my father's arm and walked him over to the nearby couch. He rested his head back and my brother and I sat down in the love seat on the opposite end of the living room.

"The Max Headroom Incident," I quietly said, afraid I might spook my father by bringing back more bad memories.

"Quiet," my mother said to me in a gentle, though very forceful tone.

"It's okay," my father said, waving his hand weakly in my mother's direction. "It's okay," he repeated. "It's time they knew."

Now for clarity's sake, I am going to tell the rest of this story exactly as it was told to my brother and I, weird bits and all.

For those that aren't aware, The Incident in question occurred on the night of November 22, 1987. Twice during the night, WGN's signal was hijacked by a guy in a Max Headroom mask (again, 1987). The first incident was during the 9 o'clock news and only lasted a moment. The second intrusion occurred later that evening on the sister channel WTTW during a rerun of Doctor Who and went for a full 90 seconds.

It was... [weird](https://youtu.be/tWdgAMYjYSs) to say the least. And to this day, nobody knows for sure who pulled the (highly illegal) stunt off.

My father's story began directly after the first intrusion. Dan Roan, a good friend of my father's and WGN's premiere sports anchor, was recounting the highlights of an earlier baseball game when the interruption occurred. 

Viewers could just make out the surreal image of Max Headroom's smiling visage before cutting out after only a few seconds. Dan even made a little quip right after.

The public knows this. The news broadcast wrapped up and that was that. 

What the public doesn't know is that Dan left the studio immediately after wrapping his segment. His nose began to bleed and his he claimed his head was pounding. A few of the stage producers also began to suffer minor ill effects, mostly just headaches and stiff neck joints.

As my father tells it, nobody made the connection. Why would they? It was nearing the holidays, everybody was stressed to begin with. A few headaches and a nose bleed (once more, 1987) were nothing to overthink in the newsroom.

So the night went on.

That evening, my father had to work late, just some extra paperwork, nothing major. However, he was more stressed than usual as my mother and him had been trying to make a baby for the past year but to no avail (a low sperm count that unfortunately my brother and I inherited). 

Being quite the sci-fi nerd, and looking to loosen up a little, he chose to do his extra work in the broadcast booth so he could watch the Doctor Who reruns that WTTW would air at 11:00.

WTTW was a sister network that would bounce off of WGN's signal to broadcast across their own channel. The studio itself was located directly below WGN's, so if they weren't filming live original content, it was essentially WGN's job to broadcast whatever old sitcom or soap that was on the docket while their own main channel was on standby.

That night, there were only three people in the booth. My father, an editor working on an outtake reel for the company Christmas party and the editor's assistant, a young female student from the University of Chicago's then brand new film program.

It was business as usual until around 11:10, my father was hit with the sudden urge to use the bathroom. Really he just wanted to finish his work, finish the episode and go home, holding in nature's call until then. 

But, and again this is how he told it, his eyes baring that same tired gaunt, faraway stare that I saw at the Christmas party all those years ago, something within him just told him he had to get up and go right at that very moment. Something deep and primal that raised the hairs on his arms and neck.

Excusing himself, he left the room and returned at 11:17. What he came back to can only be described as a nightmare.

The editor was dead, his head forced backwards at an impossible angle, his arms and legs splayed out as if he were hit by an incredible, physical force. Blood was leaking from his eyes and nose and absolutely pouring out of his mouth like a faucet.

Before my father could even react, he took notice of the assistant. Her jaw was touching the floor while the rest of her body spasmed with a violent force so strong framed pictures were falling from the wall.

My father approached her. As he told it, it was not until he was practically on top of her that he realized she was speaking. 

Apparently it wasn't until later, the initial shock still so strong, that he realized she was speaking in tongues. Never a religious man, as my father said this last part his hand waved before his face dismissively as if he still didn't believe it.

Like the editor, the young woman also began to heave out torrential waterfalls of crimson brown blood on the floor before her. As this happened, she was still trying to speak. She only stopped when she wretched up her own tongue, having seemingly bit it off during her convulsions.

She collapsed immediately afterwards, dead.

When my father was done speaking, my brother and I could only sit back in the love seat. My mother nervously fidgeted, staring at the floor. After a long moment of silence, my brother finally stammered out the inevitable:

"Wh... what happened next?"

"A lot," my father answered.

Shaking, not even aware of the broadcast intrusion that had occurred while he was in the bathroom, my father walked backwards out of the room. In the hallway, one of the overnight janitors stopped working as he saw the look of pale fright on my father's face.

"Don't go in there," my father managed to mutter between his chattering teeth. "Don't go in there."

Just as he said this, the midnight news anchor limped his way out of the studio, clutching his head, his nose gushing blood.

"Did you see it!?" he was shouting. "Goddamnit, did you fucking see it!?"

Before my father had time to respond, the doors on the opposite end of the hall burst open. Within seconds, the entire hall was full of official looking men-

"Official looking men?" I couldn't help but ask.

"Official looking men," my father repeated. "And one woman."

A peculiar woman apparently. Very tall and athletic looking, awkwardly strutting through the door after the official looking men on a pair of garish high heels. 

As the men wordlessly marched past my father and the anchor and into the control booth, the woman stopped and introduced herself as a doctor.

"What... what happened?" my father managed to ask.

She stopped for a moment, seemingly thinking, choosing her words carefully.

"A slight miscommunication, actually. They found some old rerun and thought we'd like to see more," she answered. "We think it was mostly an accident."

She laughed. "Mostly," she repeated through a queer grin.

"'They'... 'we'..." my father stammered, repeating the doctor's words. The woman reached out and touched his shoulder, trying to comfort him. 

"What the fuck!? What the fuck!?" the anchor was screeching maniacally behind the woman. She just rolled her eyes and moved her free arm towards my father. He felt a slight pinch on his side and immediately lost consciousness.

After that, there was nothing. When my father awoke, he was all alone, laying on a couch in the break room. The janitor and anchor were gone and there was seemingly not another soul in the entire building.

"Did you go back into the control room?" my brother practically demanded.

"Clean. Bone dry, no bodies. And completely and utterly clean," my father immediately answered, expecting the question.

My father drove home in a daze. My mother chimed in here, saying she knew the moment he got home, something was terribly wrong, but just couldn't get it out of him.

The janitor was never seen again. The anchor resurfaced a week later, at first saying he had no knowledge of what had happened.

"But he remembered," my father recalled. "He remembered, especially when he drank."

As he said this, he practically spat on the floor.

"And you didn't... you didn't say anything at all?" I asked quietly.

"I didn't know where to even start. I inquired to the station manager, our lead anchor, even wrote a letter to the studio head. I didn't even say exactly what happened, unsure if they would try to put me in the nut house. They knew about the intrusion of course, the whole city did. But the answer was always the same:

"'Yeah, that Max Headroom thing... that was weird, huh?'

"Just like that. All three of them."

The living room was once more trounced in silence.

"That doctor... did you ever see the woman again?" my brother asked.

"No. No, thank god. But I did receive a letter not too long after the whole thing. I burned it."

"What did it say?" my brother and I nearly shouted at the exact same time.

My father sat up from the couch, sweat beading across his pale forehead. Slowly, he walked across the living room, towards the stairs leading to his bedroom. As he crossed by my mother, she reached out and lovingly took his hand. He kissed the top of her knuckles and walked upstairs.

"What did it say?" I repeated once my father was out of ear shot, whispering through my clenched jaw.

My mother sighed and looked at me and my brother.

"'In nine months, your wife will give birth-'"

"What?"

"It's what the letter said," she continued in a low whisper. "'In nine months, your wife will give birth. Probably twins. Probably a side effect. It's in your best interest to raise them accordingly.'"

She stopped, sighing once more, staring at the ceiling as she repeated the last line of the letter:

"'You're welcome.'" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed, but it would be nice to see a shout out or two given to films that aren't strictly dramatic, historical or tragic.

I know there have been some exceptions (Dark Knight, Return of the King) and some misguided attempts to be inclusive (Avatar)... but I feel there could be way more done to give credit where credit is due. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My god, so badly. And not necessarily based on the games (though I'd like to see Revan), but just in the same time period. So far removed that you can really go anywhere with the story while still feeling very much like Star Wars.

It's the perfect place to build a new trilogy that would appeal to new fans and diehards alike.

"That's the problem," I said. "My name is Daniel. Daniel Rabinovitch."

"Oh," the ranger replied, looking as dazed as I felt. I could tell I was muttering, something I had done since I was 12 under times of duress. I breathed in.

I breathed out.

In less than 24 hours I had gone from laying in my relatively comfortable dorm room, staring at the walls in reckless boredom...

...to being attacked by a goddamn fucking monster in the middle of Bumfuck, PA. 

"Imagine what you'll know tomorrow," I heard Agent K whisper in my mind.

"...truck is outside of town. I think we should just book it, try our best to get back to the closest civilized town and... hell, I don't even know. I mean how deep does this go? Who the fuck is funding this whole... town? That woman? That Thing? Jesus, yesterday I was just..."

He was rambling. I wasn't even sure for how long.

"Hey," I said. "Your name is Sam, right?"

He stopped himself, took a deep breath. I could see the worry in his brow, the shotgun shaking in his grip. He was beginning to look like he was about to lose it. Considering what we'd been through, I certainly didn't blame him. 

But if one of us was going to go ape shit, it probably shouldn't be the guy with the truck and the gun.

"Sam?" I asked again calmly, trying to get his mind to focus.

"Sam," he finally replied. "Yeah. It's... nice to meet you, Daniel."

There was a moment of silence as we took in the surrounding trees and wilderness we found ourselves in. No birds, no buzzing bees. Just dead, sunlit silence.

"That Thing killed my parents,"
I found myself saying. "My sister too."

"I'm... sorry," Sam began. I raised my hand, stopping the stranger's apology, something I was used to hearing throughout my life.

"Why did you come here?" I asked him.

"To stop It," he replied with newfound confidence. "To stop It for good."

"Me too," I said after a moment.

Sam sighed heavily, his grip loosening around his shotgun as he lowered his arms. I could actually see the weight of his stress leaving his body as he looked up, towards the sun shining brightly overhead.

"I'm afraid," he started. "I'm very afraid. But I came here to stop It. I know I did."

"Then that is exactly what we do," I said as I got to my feet. I began to search through my jean pockets.

"That doctor. The woman... she had the same last name as you."

"Yeah," I said, finding the miniature box in my front pocket. "Before you ask, I've never seen her before in my life. Frankly, she gives me the fucking creeps."

"You have no idea," Sam muttered through a defeated smile. "Know anything about this place?"

"Yes, actually," I answered, my hands now looking for the small bottle in my inside jacket pocket. "My parents would take us here when we were kids. It used to be a big coal town. They abandoned it when some mine fire tore through the underground caverns."

Sam grunted something. He began to glare towards the distant town. He seemed to be expecting something. Some monster movie tentacle to peek up over the facade of buildings. Or maybe a hooded army of cult members marching towards us with torches and pitch forks.

It's what I was expecting anyway. But no. Things were quiet, almost peaceful. The vehicles that the doctor's goons arrived in were now missing and any signs of the gory display from earlier were long gone.

"The fire is still burning, you know, to this day. And I know where the mine entrance is."

"Huh," Sam mumbled, still glaring absently at the old town. "Interesting."

"Hey!" I nearly shouted. He turned around to face me.

"Oh," he said for the second time in ten minutes, thought finally registering on his face.

I held up the matches and lighter fluid.

"Let's stop It," I said.

<TEXT> It's a crappy job. But I guess somebody has to do it. That's what we tell each other when we get our pay checks anyway. Ever know somebody that worked in a mall? It's shit work for shit pay. It's made even worse when you're the janitor.

Every single night, I have to mop from Point A to Point B. If I had to be honest, I guess it wasn't such a terrible gig. Yeah, you got the occasional kid throwing up over the escalator. Or that time the kid actually got stuck in one. A loose shoe lace or something. Dragged the poor little bastard towards the cut off, destroying his leg from the knee down in the process. We had to shut the thing down for a week while we scraped out the flesh and blood and bone that looked like splintered wood chips by the time the stairs were through with it.

It was a rough time to be sure. But nothing compares to the goddamn [Animal Riders](https://goo.gl/images/2mN5jY). Ever since they opened up, a new mess every goddamn night. If you're not aware, the Animal Riders are this new weird fad with no real explanation for its popularity. Like frozen yogurt.

They're these sort of stuffed animals. Most of them are bigger than life size with an exaggerated head with large, pearly white cartoon eyes and a wide grin. They move around on all fours with a saddle on their back for the kids and wheels for feet. It's nothing more than a lame ride, though for some reason, they're really fucking popular. Which is strange. They're no faster than a golf cart and can barely even turn without coming to a complete stop. At our mall we have a dog, a panda and a goddamn pig.

Every night I get a call from one of the security guards: "The pig is on its side." "The pig is wet, needs to be cleaned." "It looks like blood, come mop it up. Next to the pig."

That fucking pig. It's bad enough that there always seems to be a new problem it, but there's also something just... off about it. Just the way it looks. It's like every hooligan for twenty miles feels this need to fuck with the pig. Easy target I guess.

And the people they have running the operation don't help at all. They look almost like carnie folk. Lots of tattoos and piercings, not exactly the type you'd want your kids around. 

It's kinda funny actually. Five of them run the thing, though they swap their shifts. So I'll see at least two of them, one in the morning, one in the afternoon. You'd think the others must have the day off, but then come night time, I'd see all five leave together. It's not something you would normally notice, except these dirtbags stand out so much, it's impossible not to raise an eye when they pass you in the hall.

Well, the days were going fairly normal, just the usual daily clean-ups. The mall tends to slow down its business between Easter and the start of Summer. There are no big consumer holidays and the usual mallrats are still in class so there's not exactly a lot of excitement to pass the time.

That is until the other night, when things got extra weird. It was late, long past closing time. One of the security guards told me a good cleaning was needed. He sounded extra fuckin' beat. Said there was a mess by the pig (of course) and it had to be cleaned ASAP. He was practically yelling at me over the walkie.

Well, I get there and the dude is pretty much heaving onto the floor. Of course I told him to cut the shit or he could clean his own goddamn mess. He mumbled an apology and pointed towards the Animal Riders

"Over there," he blurted, covering his mouth as he dry heaved. I couldn't help but notice the bundle of wrinkled twenties in his grip. He shoved the wad in his pocket when he noticed me staring.

"What's the problem?" I asked. "Little too late to be riding the animals, don't you think?"

I was trying to lighten the mood, but I don't think it worked. The guy promptly threw up, mumbled something about quitting and just pointed towards the ride.

"Figures," I found myself saying out loud.

I came to the Animal Riders. The dog and the panda were on their sides of course. Next to them was a pile of vomit and next to that a small puddle of blood. Interestingly, the pig was nowhere to be found.

Not all of it anyway. The four hooves were still there, attached to the set of wheels that drive the thing. But the bulk of the pig was nowhere in sight.

That's when I noticed the foot prints next to the wheels. Pressed into the blood and vomit and headed towards the mall's exit.

"Jesus Christ," I found myself saying out loud. I turned back towards the security guard, but he was already gone.

I decided to follow the foot prints towards the exit. Peeking through the main entrance, I could make out a white van idling alone in the parking lot, just under the lone glow of a worn out street lamp. There was some kind of commotion by the sliding door. 

When I glanced a little closer, I could see there was a man shoving something into the van. It was weird enough as it was, but when I saw him round the side towards the driver's door, I saw that he was also completely fucking naked, covered in blood and vomit. I could see two distinct red trails leading from his nostrils to his belly button, mixing together with what looked like thick green pea soup.

In his hands was a screwdriver and the van's license plate.

The utter shock of the sight made my eyes go wide. And before I could stop myself, I made for the double doors and began speed walking towards the van.

"Hey," I shouted. "Hey you!"

He caught sight of me through the driver's window and started shouting something into the backseat. I heard him curse loudly as I got within a few feet of the van and he began to speed away, the side door still wide open.

As it sped right past me, missing me by inches, I saw two other men in the back of the van. A single cardboard box and a large fur coat flew out of the back as they shut the door, cursing and shouting even louder than before.

They took off out of the empty parking lot and into the night. As they made the turn onto the main road, they were going so fast I couldn't believe the van didn't tip over.

I looked down at my feet. I had stomped though quite a bit of the blood and vomit now and the sight almost made me toss up my dinner. That's when the box and the coat caught my attention.

I stooped down and slowly opened the ratty, tattered box. Inside was a treasure trove of drug paraphernalia and pills as well as a single small baggie of what looked like rock candy. I'm sure it wasn't.

Then the smell hit me. I looked up, towards the soiled fur coat stretched haphazardly across the black top. Through the glow of the street lamp, I noticed that the coat had a pink tint to it. A pink tint covered in crusty white and red and brown stains. Something large was just sticking out from underneath the cloth.

I hesitantly moved closer, shoving the coat with a quick, hard kick from my work boot. The thing flipped over and I nearly fell backwards. 

Staring back at me was the jolly faced head of a cartoon pig, still stitched to the saddle that had formerly been attached to four small hooves and a set of wheels.

It wasn't a fur coat. And it wasn't a stuffed toy. 

It was a costume.

I promptly threw up, my vomit sloshing against the pig's furry pink forehead and dripping into its wide open grin.

I rubbed my eyes, almost tripping over my own feet as I attempted to regain my composure. As I looked back towards the mall, I could just make out two figures in the entrance way staring back at me.

Though both towering figures stood in the shadows, the darkened silhouettes of a dog and a panda were unmistakable. </TEXT>

"What is this?" I found myself shouting, the shotgun quivering in my grip. I was terrified, scared shitless, though trying not to show it.

The kid was still next to me, looked like he was about to hug my arm. I didn't blame him.

"No reason to fear us," the man in front of us said, his arms outstretched as more and more people filled in the Main Street facade behind him.

The man. Or something like it. He was tall and his eyebrows seemed almost painted on to the stretched out flesh that made up his forehead. A just too small three piece suit gripped his body and I'm pretty sure he was wearing a toupee. His eyes were small and beady and, if I wasn't mistaken, had no whites. Just the hazel of his iris stretched from one side to the other. Just like the eyes of a goat. 

I was immediately reminded of the woman in the cabin. Just in time too.

The helicopter whooshed overhead, hastily and somewhat sloppily making its landing in the spot where the kid's car used to be.

Used to be... shit...

The woman and two large looking gentlemen disembarked. Her once creaseless suit was a heap draped over her scuffed and tired looking body. She marched towards us, all business, taking the lead over the two burly men.

The kid nudged me, motioning away from the woman and the chopper. Towards the man and his crowd. Their eyes were still plastered to us, all of their faces wearing the same facsimile of a human smile. It was as if they didn't even notice the helicopter or the doctor huffing her way towards us. The man in the suit in particular almost looked like he was about to wink. Almost.

"Just hold it," the doctor started. "Just hold it right there goddamnit!" She brushed past me, though I noticed a small moment of hesitation when she met eyes with the kid. She almost looked surprise, an emotion she didn't seem too fond of.

"Dr. Rabinovitch," the man in the suit began. At the sound of the guy's strange voice, the kid squeezed my arm uncomfortably. I didn't blame him. "So lovely to see you today. And such a lovely day it is, isn't it-"

"Not in the mood, Smith," the woman cut the man off, turning her full attention towards me. Her two large guards seemed ready to pounce and I found the kid and I must've been thinking the same thing. Together we stepped back as I raised my shotgun.

The woman smiled a crooked grin of too perfect teeth. I felt like firing right then and there.

"What is this?" I shouted again. "That Thing... that fucking Thing! What the hell is It?"

"Hell, Samuel, if you stuck around the cabin a little longer, you'd already know," the doctor said. "I was just getting to It when somebody threw a fucking walkie talkie at my face!"

"Oh," the man cooed. "Language, doctor, please..."

"Jesus, Smith..." the woman said as she lit a cigarette. Smith, the man, only smiled back. "I'm not in the business of repeating myself," she continued, "but since your friend here looks new, I'll indulge you. Well," she stopped herself, "new-ish."

She waved at the kid who took another step back.

"Just talk to me," I said suddenly feeling very protective of boy. "Don't worry about him."

"Very well. I'll skip the long version and just tell you the truth," she said as she breathed in a lung of smoke that escaped out of her nose effortlessly. "We don't really know. Hell, apparently the Thing has been around so goddamn long, we have records that go back to..." 

She paused, as if she caught herself saying too much. "Well... a very long time," she went on. "And I'm sure you can see why certain... officials... might find good use of such a... being."

"So this is a government thing?" I asked, taking note that the kid was looking more and more distressed.

"In a matter of speaking," she continued. "It's a government thing sure, but not the government you're... familiar with."

I took a moment to eyeball the woman and her cohorts... as well as the mass of people behind them which I could now see was nearly twice the size that it was just a few minutes before. They were beginning to circle around us, something I had failed to notice as the doctor was speaking.

"And these people," I began. "Are they some kind of cult?"

"Now that's a harsh word," Smith said, looking genuinely hurt. "We prefer 'Believers.'"

"Of course you do," I said as I circled around, the shotgun now pointed directly in the eyes of one of the 'Believers' standing directly behind us, a very old looking knife in her grasp.

"We're leaving now!" I shouted loud enough for everyone to hear. "As a duly appointed member of Pennsylvania law enforcement, I will arrest or fire upon any would be attackers or assailants! Is that understood?"

My lie was greeted with stone cold silence, the type of silence that made my balls shrivel into my lower cavity.

And then the 'Believer' with the knife began to shriek as her body struck the ground with incredible force. So did half the congregation, all in unison, heaving their bodies as they shouted in tongues.

"Oh Christ," I heard the doctor mutter as her and the goons began to back away down Main Street. "Let's go Smith."

Smith suddenly moved towards us. I pointed the shotgun and he just smiled, lowered to the ground and kissed the forehead of the writhing woman. He got back to his feet and mouthed something, smiling like a loon. He joined the doctor and her guards and together they made haste towards the other side of town. I was suddenly struck by an incredible feeling of unease, even more so than the entire situation warranted.

Something bad was about to happen.

The kid grabbed my arm yet again, shaking and pointing. "Look... look at those ones... look at the ones still standing," he stammered, his teeth clicking uncontrollably as he literally shook with fear.

But I did notice. With half the 'Believers' on the ground shaking and moaning, that left the other half just standing there, lost in a twilight state. All of them wore the same expression, one of eerie understanding, their grins baring no teeth. Just a half smirk that didn't budge beneath their blinkless eyes.

And then they began to move too, though not at all in the same fashion as the ones on the ground. Instead, they first began to vibrate. This was followed by a horrible cracking sound, the sound of bone gnashing against bone, as something began to give in each and every one of them.

All throughout this, the only soundtrack was the chorus of moans as their brethren continued to writhe upon the dirt and grass.

And then the ones still standing, they began to crumble. Their heads and chest began to cave in as if they were being sucked through a miniature black hole localized within their breast cavity. I could just make out skulls and teeth through the simultaneous waves of blood and mutilated flesh, grinding into forced nothing as they were seemingly sucked within themselves.

Just when the impossible sight could not get any stranger, they began to move. As one, these former beings struggled to shove themselves forward, one foot in front of the other. We watched in stunned horror as they began to find one another, their limbs wrapping impossibly around their blood-soaked and mutilated kin.

I wanted to look away but couldn't, the surreal, ghastly sight just too damn strange to turn away from. They were joining. First two became one. Then that one found a third and the process started again, each Thing finding another piece of Itself, slowly and sloppily and gruesomely evolving.

The kid promptly vomited on my shoes, snapping me out of my hypnotized funk.

Behind us, the chorus of moans was muffled as a trail of black vans began to pull into the city in the direction from which we came, speeding over the road and directly up to the front of the security gate.

"Run," I said, practically a whisper. And we did. As fast as our legs could carry us. We ran away from the black vans and the writhing crowd, down towards the woods behind Main Street, the only direction that somehow made sense.

I could just begin to hear men barking orders from the van as we hit the line of trees, the branches cracking against our heaving shoulders as we didn't dare slow our pace.

I chanced a quick look over my shoulder. I saw more towering goons wearing suits. They wandered effortlessly past the city limits, walking directly up to the crowd on Main Street. Most of the suits were holding something in their hand, looked like a large cell phone. I could just make out a slight buzz.

The last thing I saw was a group of the towns people now on the ground, no longer conjoined. Instead, they were shrieking, wailing loudly with what sounded like pain, their deformed, fleshy limbs wiggling in the air with reckless, aimless abandon.

And that's when I ran directly into a large oak tree and hit the ground and closed my eyes.

When I opened them, I gasped loudly, afraid I had been out for hours. It had been seconds. Staring at me, at the foot of the oak, was the kid. Bunched up with his arms in a knot, the boy stared at me with a mix of confusion, horror and sadness.

He was whispering something. It sounded like, "The name, the name, the name..."

I cautiously approached him, periodically turning back towards the town to make nobody was moving in our direction. As I got to the foot of the oak, the kid barely glanced in my direction.

"The name, the name, the goddamn name," he continued, lost in what seemed like a minor psychotic break.

"My name," I tried to sound friendly. "It's Samuel. Samuel Beck. What's... um, what's your's?"

The kid stopped speaking. Slowly he raised his head and his eyes found mine. The red circles that had appeared gave me pause as I found myself stepping backwards. He had been crying, though I don't think even he realized it.

"That's the problem," he said. "My name is Daniel. Daniel Rabinovitch."

It took me a moment of realization, but eventually my eyes went wide and I took yet another step back.

"Oh," I said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand that risk can be involved with eBay sales. Having said that, I am in no way the type that makes a business out of selling things on there. If this was a simple matter of buyer received the PC, it didn't work and now they want their money back say a week or two later, I wouldn't dispute it. However, holding on to a computer for 2+ months without turning it on then telling me things are not working out after trying to change the operating system upwards of 3 times is a different story. My main concern is I get the PC back and it has irreparable damage done to it. Then I am out the money and a computer (not to mention the seller's fee through eBay).

If your recommendation after all of that is roll over and take it because business is business, I respectfully disagree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EDIT - Thank you all for the comments and recommendations. While it sounds like I may be out of luck, I will still try to contact PayPal directly and fight it out a bit more. Regardless, I am unfortunately done with their services for good and will be letting them know (after 15+ years). I know that may not mean a lot to a large entity like PayPal, but it certainly does to me.

The buyer had sent me multiple messages on eBay that have stated she tried to switch the operating system from Windows 8 to 10 and then back to 8. Again, this was just a week ago despite the fact that they have had it since the first week of February. As the title states, she also indicated that she had just turned it on even though she's had it for 10 weeks now (which I find so bizarre). I am getting nowhere with PayPal's customer service and I really don't think I should have to pay this. Am I wrong here or is does this all sound a little suspicious? Does anybody know of any resources I should use to fight this besides PayPal? eBay basically told me they cannot do anything and if the buyer did do something to hinder the PC, I'll not only be out $300, but also eBay's fee and I won't be able to resell it.

"I don't know what they call It now," he had said, "but back then, in Centralia, everyone called It the Crick It."

The Crick It. The term reverberated in my skull for the umpteenth time that day. Especially now that I had arrived in Centralia.

The sun just began to shine over the dew covered grass sticking up sparsely through the uneven cracks that spread like veins across the former town's Main Street.

Last night, I found myself tossing and turning in my dorm room, periodically getting up and just wandering around the empty building. It was an old hotel, one of the oldest buildings in modern downtown Pittsburgh. It had been converted into dorms only a few years ago, yet the place still looked like it belonged in the 30's.

At night, they said a ghost shuffled along the halls. I even heard a recording of it walking around a friend's single dorm. Spooky stuff, sure, but what concerned me most was the feeling of the place. Too quiet even in the daytime, at night an eerie yellow mood draped the endless, beige hallways. It sounded like the bottom deck of an old ship, the never ending settling sounds of the ancient building coming off like lame waves striking the hull of a powerful wooden boat.

It was hypnotic almost. That's the only way I can explain the brown out I experienced as I realized I was no longer in the building. I wasn't even on the street. Instead I was in my car, the old Crown Vic the orphanage had managed to get me on my 16th birthday. In my car and already over half way to the Pittsburgh city limits.

I almost gasped as I found myself turning on to the highway. The sudden shock of what I was doing hit me like a punch in the face. I rolled down the manual window, letting a little fresh air in. The last thing I saw as I left the city behind me was what looked like two bums fighting or fucking under the overpass bridge. One of them wasn't moving.

I blinked hard and they were both gone. A trick of the light. Or maybe it was my mind's way of telling me I really should be in bed. Not in my dorm. Not at the orphanage. But at home. Where I belonged.

My mind lingered on my family, taken from me far too early. Taken by a monster, or so I was told. As unbelievable as it seemed, the part of my brain that dragged me to my car in the middle of the night certainly thought there was some truth to it.

"Everyone in Pennsylvania knows about Centralia," I muttered in a daze. A daze I snapped out of as I realized the sun was almost up and I had just pulled up to the abandoned town's city limits. A barely standing Welcome signed loomed in front of me:

"Welcome to Centralia! The gem of Central Pennsyl-WARNING! RESTRICTED ENTRY! ALL TRESPASSERS WILL BE ARRESTED! DANGER! HAZARDOUS!"

The orange flyer covering most of the sign looked fresh.

"Impossible," I said to myself as I glared at the warning before me. 

240 miles. Like that. I didn't even stop to get gas. Yet a glance at my nearly full tank told me differently. I shut off the car and the fuel meter immediately dropped, a blunt refusal to acknowledge the impossibility of the situation.

I hastily exited the car and looked past the sign. A large fence now wrapped itself around what seemed like the entire parameter of the small town. Like the orange warning, the fence too looked less than a few weeks old, it's metal woven trappings shining brilliantly in the dawn's morning light.

"Hey."

I froze. Somebody mumbled just behind me, a muted voice that sounded almost defeated.

"Hey," he said again. "Turn around."

I did as I was told, coming face to face with what looked like a park ranger. Dark circles under his eyes gave him a gaunt look, almost haunted.

"Sorry," I started. "I didn't mean to be any trouble. I was just... it's been awhile since I've been here."

"Not supposed to be here. Follow me."

The man nodded and approached me. Before I could even react, he walked right past where I stood, waving awkwardly for me to follow as he approached the large fence.

Not really knowing what else to do, I followed. We reached the parameter of the fence in no time and the man lead me to a padlocked medal door. Expecting this man to be some sort of official, I waited for him to produce a key-

With a loud crash, the guy kicked the door as hard as he could. It swung open, slamming with a crash against the other side of the fence.

"Oh, um..." I stammered.

"Follow," he said again. Though his voice...

"Am I in some kind of trouble or-"

"Hey!" a familiar voice shouted from behind me. I turned around. "Hey kid!"

There, by my car, was another man. A man dressed like a park ranger. A man who looked identical to the one I had just followed to the gate. He was running as fast as he could. In his hand, he was pointing a pistol.

"Oh, shit..." I heard my own voice trail off as the man behind me began to produce a strange gurgling noise. Before I had a chance to even turn around, I felt something grasp my ankle and pull.

I fell to the ground, hitting my head as my body spun around just in time to see the Thing that lead me into Centralia. Through my blurred vision, I could see that It kept the form of the park ranger. It was now within the fence, a solid fifteen feet from me. Its grotesque, elongated appendage, imitating the arm of a man, was still wrapped around my ankle. Such a creature, out and about in the morning sun...

It began to drag me. Dilapidated buildings began to appear in my peripheral. Downtown Centralia, a skeleton of what it once was. As I moved, I swore I could see shapes in some of the windows, watching as I helplessly struggled against the Thing's grip.

Behind me, I could hear the man, the real man, shouting after me. The fucking Thing was whistling. Sounded like Kings of Leon. 

It only stopped when I heard the gunshots begin to echo throughout the town. Two of the bullets struck the creature... struck the monster in the shoulder. My vision began to clear and my mind began to give the rest of my body the kick in the ass it needed.

"Stay down!"

I barely had time to react to the shouting man before I saw that he had ran right up to the side of the Thing. It began to grow, stretching upwards, morphing the face of the man It was trying to imitate and intimidate.

The ranger didn't even hesitate. A shotgun now in his hands, he placed the barrel directly into the mouth of his doppelgnger and pulled the trigger. The monster snarled and screeched, unleashing a torrent of what almost sounded like English curse words.

It hit the ground with a thud, a lifeless husk for barely a second as new appendages appeared around the side of the creature, dragging Itself off into the town with breakneck speed.

It twisted Itself around a corner and back over the fence, disappearing into the nearby woods.

I exhaled. I hadn't even realized I was holding my breath throughout the entire ordeal.

"Here," the ranger said, holding out his hand for me to take. Sensing my hesitation, the man kneeled down, helping me to my feet whether I liked it or not.

And then I began to cry. Turning to the man, this stranger, I began to weep openly. He eventually embraced my shoulders. I think he may have been holding back tears himself.

And that's when we heard a new voice.

"Such love," a sickly sweet voice rung out. "It's what we're all about here."

The ranger dropped the embrace, taking aim with his shotgun without missing a beat.

It was an older man, he had just walked out of a nearby church. He was wearing an impeccably tailored suit, his hands outstretched before him. Behind him, exiting the other buildings one by one, were others, all dressed in similar attire.

"Such love," he said again. "It's what we're all about here in Centralia."

I found myself stepping closer to the ranger as I took a glance behind me, back towards the entrance.

Back towards the vacant spot in the road where my car once was.

"Shit," I said. </TEXT>

I froze for a moment, unsure if this was some kind of prank. If it was, it was in pretty poor taste just two days after Reynold's breakdown. I rose from my chair and walked towards the walkie, empty static now filling the room as I began to speak.

"This is Sam, who is this? Over."

No response. And suddenly I realized just how quiet the cabin was without anybody else by my side. Even the usual forest noises had ceased. A lot of people seem surprised by just how loud the woods can be at ni-

Something darted by the window, low to the sill, but fast. I moved over as swiftly and quietly as I could, grasping my heavy flashlight by the handle as I did. It may not be a gun exactly, but the thing could pack one helluva wallop.

I hunched forward, peeking through the quiet darkness, holding my breath. 

Nothing. 

Just the usual pitch black canvas filled with trees. And my overactive imagination filling in the blanks with old monster movie memories.

I smiled, though it was short lived. I really wasn't in the mood for this shit tonight. I raised the walkie, ready to lay down a little hell, my finger poised to press the button so hard it might even snap off. 

"Everyone IN Valley ForgE KNOws about the CRIck IT," the voice repeated. It was louder this time and slightly less distorted. I almost fell backwards, fumbling the radio as I did, getting a firm grasp only as I lost my balance and fell back into the chair.

I could only stare at the walkie. I found myself suddenly too wary to respond, all the spit and vinegar I was saving up disappearing in a single instant.

I was afraid. There was something about that voice. It was like hearing something that was read in reverse but then played in the correct order and on a loop. Mechanical, distorted and all wrong.

I pressed the receiver. Only static again. I hesitated, licking my lips nervously.

"Hey, whoever this is-"

Something walked across the roof. Skittered was more accurate, from one end of the cabin to the other.

I froze for what felt like an eternity, my eyes glued to the ceiling, my free hand wrapping once more around my flashlight.

And that's when the radio crackled to life once more. Only this time, I didn't feel fear. There wasn't a term for it, honestly. But it wasn't good. 

Of all the horrors I would experience in the coming minutes, it's only a single uttered, nearly whispered word that still undoubtedly and unequivocally shakes me to my core as I reflect back on all of it:

"Daddy?" the distorted voice on the other side of the radio sheepishly asked.

Slowly, I found my line of sight transferring back to the walkie in my shaking grasp. My flashlight fell to the floor, breaking in two parts and rolling in opposite directions.

"Whaa-?" I sort of asked, my lips and tongue too paralyzed to create proper words.

"DaddY? WheRE are YOU?"

The red hot tears were falling from my face before I even had a chance to realize I had started crying. I rose from the chair, clutching the walkie for dear life.

"DAddy!"

"Au... Austin? I'm... I'm right here buddy, I'm right he-" I began to break down, my body heaving as I embraced the walkie, unable to even comprehend my surroundings.

Until I heard the laughing. That same distorted voice, now a low cackle on the other side of the radio. I wiped at my eyes, my emotions sobering up.

"What is this!" I demanded, my voice just a nothing in the silence.

The laughing ceased as my eyes were once again drawn to the window. There was some kind of commotion by the tree line. Six bulky figures, moving through the darkness.

And that's when the door flung open. A woman walked in, wearing high heels and a business suit. Here, in a cabin in the middle of the woods. But that wasn't the only thing alien about her. Something was off, the tightness of her skin, the way she walked in a stiff waltz across the floorboards. Gracefully peculiar. And her age... could have been anywhere between 40 and 200.

"Who the hell are you?" I demanded, my glare racing back and forth between the walkie and this new intruder.

"Relax, Samuel, try to relax," she said, desperately trying to mask the natural malice in her voice. "I'm a doctor. And I know what you're going through right now and I just wish to help."

The entire world suddenly lit up from the outside as, through the window, I saw a stream of flames spewed forth upon a nearby tree.

Flamethrowers. Those bulky figures were men with fucking flamethrowers. They had dogs too, giving the impression of some sort of suped-up hunting party. The sight sent me leaping back once again, an eerie orange hue now draped across the innards of the cabin.

Before I could ask another question, the "doctor" was by my side. She tried to whisper soothing words again, but I felt the tip of the needle before she even opened her mouth.
 
I shoved the woman as hard as I could. She fell back, though caught her balance. I could actually see her legs flex with a queer resistance as she regained her composure.

The orange hue grew with intensity as from outside three more flamethrowers joined their brother in seemingly burning the forest to the ground.

And then I saw the ground move, just below the men's feet. Some of the dogs began barking. And one of the men began to shout. And then firearms replaced the flamethrowers, gunshots reverberating throughout the nearby woods.

I turned back to the woman. In the brief seconds since I had shoved her I almost forgot she was even there. There was a gun in her hand now, though after everything that had happened, I barely comprehended it as a threat.

"The fuck is that Thing? How did It sound like... what is It?" I shouted, holding the walkie in the air like a weapon. I began to babble, almost incoherently.

But I was cut off as a severed... something struck the window. The glass didn't give, but the sensation was that of the entire cabin shaking at once. As the bloody appendage slid towards the grass below, I could have sworn it was twitching.

"Listen goddamnit!" the doctor shouted, waving the gun around dramatically with each syllable. "We could've done this the easy way, but I see that's not going to happen! Now I can explain every-"

I threw the damn walkie as hard as I could, hit her right in the face too. Before she fell to the ground, I noticed her blood. It was dark... still red, but black too. A sweet odor not unlike freshly mowed grass filled the cabin.

And then the cabin really did begin to shake. Violently. I began to stagger, grabbing the nearby wall to steady myself. I noticed the shouting and barking and gunshots had ceased.

The floor gave in... well gave out was more like it. Something green and brown and red and fleshy burst through the newly formed hole. It was vaguely humanoid and had what might be described as appendages, ghoulish lumps hanging off Its side. There was an open crevice towards the top of It you might even call a mouth. It certainly had teeth. And a revolting black discharge, like puss, dripped from Its every pore. 

I couldn't speak as I took the surreal scene in. But in that instant, I knew I was in the presence of something weird and something pissed off. Something old.

Something evil.

Somehow, I dared not look away. The Thing was before me for less than a minute, smoke now billowing through the surrounding crevice in the floor. And yet, in that small moment, a clear picture took form upon the bulk of the Thing. 

Austin's face. And then his shoulders and then his arms. Clear as a bell, mere inches from my body. My son was climbing out of this fucking Thing before me, reaching out and dripping with blood and dirt.

Before I could take his hand for the first time in 5 years, an electronic, ear splitting sound emitted from the woman on the ground. Austin vanished instantly and the Thing recoiled. It almost seemed disgusted.

A haze I hadn't even realized I was in dissipated as the piercing sound continued to fill the cabin... it was a full five seconds before I realized the Thing before me was making Its own noise, shrieking like a crying child... my crying child.

I ran for the door. Before my hand was on the knob, my brain kicked into overdrive and made a split second decision that may have saved my life.

I stooped down next to the woman. Her eyes were glazed as she seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness. Her hand reached for mine pathetically. I ignored it as I grabbed the gun off the floor and snagged the phone and car keys sticking out of her jacket pocket.

"DaaaaDDY?" I heard behind me through the shrieking.

I didn't even try to look back as I made my exit.

I barely recall running through the woods. My truck was parked directly on the other side of the cabin and yet I didn't even think about going for it. That meant another potential glimpse of that damned Thing.

Instead, I made a direct line towards the woods. The branches crashed against my heaving chest and shoulders, my park hat long left behind. 

After what felt like hours (in actuality, maybe 5 minutes), my tired legs carried me into the visitor's parking lot, the newfound quiet darkness shocking me out of my funk. 

A pair of black vans and a single sedan sat isolated in the center of the paved lot. Without even thinking about it, I removed the woman's keys from my jacket pocket and pressed the lock button. The sedan's lights flashed followed by a honk that pierced the eerily quiet scene. I actually shushed the damn thing as I climbed into the driver's seat. Collapsed into it actually.

I took a moment to breathe. Before me, through the shrouded woods, I could just make out the cabin, a flaming orange, ever moving dot within the landscape.

I rubbed my eyes, forcing my mind to recollect everything it had witnessed in the last... what? Only twenty minutes? I knew even the attempt at comprehension could drive me mad.

And that's when I noticed the stack of folders piled haphazardly on the passenger's seat. Atop the very first one, my name was printed neatly.

I should have thrown that stack out the window. Maybe hightailed it for my parent's house, or even my ex's... somewhere completely unpredictable. But no. No, instead my curiosity had me picking up the top folder and opening it.

Everything. Everything imaginable about me from the hospital I was born in to my marriage right out of high school. Everything about me, my parents, my ex... the accident... Austin...

And then I began looking through every folder. Next up was Reynolds followed by the family from two days ago. Their daughter. 

Their dead son.

After that, the info dump. Nothing directly about what this Thing was, but certainly plenty about It. Glancing back and forth towards the cabin from time to time, I tried my best to speed through the notes.

Before I knew it, a vague though no less horrifying picture was painted before me. The missing persons throughout the years all through the area... the authorities and the media (local and national) told to ignore it. The clean up that would occur after an attack, both physically and financially, was almost too much to handle. And yet they still managed to keep It a secret.

Because they were cultivating It. Had been for years. Whatever It was, It was incredibly dangerous. Seemingly at will, It was capable of... transforming. Shift shape into whatever the hell It deemed necessary to accomplish Its goals. And what were Its goals? Even the damn Thing's handlers didn't seem to have a clue.

The implications of such a creature existing were dizzying to think about.

I came to the final page. It was a map, a very old map. At the top was a note, written sloppily and jammed into the corner:

"Dr. R-

Say Hi to Bradfield. Tell him baby's doing just fine but misses his scent. Tell him baby loves him. Show him baby's progress.

-Smith"

The map was a town, looked almost barren. However there were lines scribbled across it, clearly from a marker, written in the same style as the note.

"Two miles today."

"Dog and cat here. Baby played with dog's tail before dinner. Cat didn't stand a chance."

"Hitchhiker on 61. Old man, easy prey. Baby started feet first, the vagrant didn't stop squirming until baby was up to his neck."

"Tourists on 61. Mother, father, toddler. Dad tried to fight, had to use gun. Mom was first, holding crying toddler while baby ate."

And there were plenty more just like it. Dozens of little notes dotted the map with crude X's. Though I wasn't entirely sure what I was reading, I had a good idea and the sensation literally sickened me. I opened the driver's door, vomiting on to the cool pavement below. Steam began to rise almost immediately.

My nausea was replaced with anger as I wiped away the remaining spittle around my mouth. Years. Actual years this Thing has been roaming around, doing (and eating) as It pleased. My blood boiled as I glanced into the rear view. A shotgun hung idly against the left backseat. I swung around to find a box of shells directly underneath.

I looked forward again, starting the car. Almost a full tank. I took one last glance at the burning cabin. For a moment, it looked like something was stirring, but I couldn't be sure. And I didn't want to wait and find out.

I removed the woman's gun and cell from my pockets, tossing them onto the pile of folders as I pulled out of the parking lot, trying my damndest not to waste any more time. As I took off towards the park's exit, the morning's light just began to peek over the tree line. I stole another glance at the tattered map, taking in the title scrolled across the top. Strange name for a town, even a little ominous. But it was only a two hour drive.

I needed answers. Or maybe it was revenge. Petty revenge just for having to face that goddamn Thing. Either way, I had the distinct feeling I would find both in Centralia. </TEXT>

"Rotten, wretched son of a bitch," I muttered as I got to my feet, kicking off the fucking heels they always insist I wear.

Heels. In the middle of the fucking woods.

I spat. Blood, but no teeth. My goddamn head was pounding though and I could feel the fresh welt without even touching it. And the heat... the fire outside must've reached the roof.

Below me, the cabin floor was a vacant, smoldering hole. That black shit that always falls off of It was caked into the broken wooden slats, though no blood other than what I had just spit up. Not a good sign. The bastard probably got away.

I exited the cabin as the flames indeed engulfed the roof, the low hanging branches handing the fire over like a pitcher pouring water. Outside, all three dogs were gone, though their bloody prints remained. I doubt any of my soldiers survived either. That bastard probably slipped away while they were being eaten alive.

"Routine," I said. I couldn't help but smile.

It's a word that gets thrown around far too much for my liking, especially in my line of work. If this were Hollywood, they'd probably call me a "Professional" or a "Cleaner." I preferred nothing more than businesswoman myself, but I guess it doesn't quite have the same effect.

Of course, my business is certainly unique and appearances are everything. You can't meet with a small town mayor dressed in fatigues or a lab coat, it sends the wrong message. And I always tried to look my best on the job (heels or not), though I've always felt a little silly wearing a business-casual suit to... what?... maintain a monster? Sure, it sounds a little silly. But I often fumble to find a better noun to describe that goddamn Thing.

That Thing...

Fuck, I hate It. Don't even like thinking about It. The first time I saw It, It was pretending to be a log. A goddamn log, just lying around in the middle of that godforsaken nothing Town.

One of the tracking dogs started sniffing It. Before the poor creature could even bark, the Thing opened up like a fucking bear trap, split right in half. Even after it closed again, I could still hear the animal's choked, gurgled whimper.

And the gnashing and the chewing and the slithery slurp as It... digested...

I spat again just thinking about It. That was a very long time ago, but I still remember those faces. "The Townspeople." Cult was more fucking like it. Falling and bowing, some of them were even weeping. Sobbing their goddamn eyes out while a fucking log fucking ate a fucking dog.

Surreal doesn't even begin to describe it.

And now here I was, nearly 100 miles from The Town. A hundred miles and an impossible amount of years later and I still shudder when I think about that first encounter. But business was business, what are you going to do?

Funny, this wasn't even the first time the damn Thing got this far out, It even came to the same place (near enough anyway). Two of our earliest finds, a local principal and a teacher. In the 70's, they tried to conjure the fucking Thing with rituals and orgies. It worked alright.

Some of the families still don't know the truth about what happened to the victims. Bradfield, the teacher... total crony. He took the fall, actually believed the damn Thing was a god. Thought Smith was too... Smith, the principal. We faked his death, sent him to The Town. 

We had to. We had to figure out exactly how he managed to call It to him... boy, that fucking weird pervert. I've been around for a long time. Too long. But it still makes me shudder, looking into those black eyes of his.

And now here we were again. My team had begun to circle the cabin, weapons ready. When we first arrived, we could see the moron through the window, clutching his walkie, looked like he had just seen a goddamn ghost. I didn't bother knocking, just walked right in. If the intel was correct, that fucking Thing was just around the corner.

The guy was younger, barely 30. There was a second guy too and a family. They would be dealt with as well. The cops knew enough to keep their mouth shut. What did the file say? "Bear attack"? Real original, guys.

"Who the hell are you?" he demanded, choking on his own frightened words. I think he may have even been crying. He looked at me, then back to the walkie in his hand, panic shaking his entire frame. I didn't blame his demeanor, who knows what that fucking Thing said to him.

"Relax, Samuel, try to relax," I cooed to him. "I'm a doctor. And I know what you're going through right now and I just wish to help."

From outside the closest window, the darkness lit up as the first of our jarhead patrol laid down a swath of liquid fire from one of the 'throwers. Great timing, fellas.

Sam yelped and then jumped, his fragile state shaken even further. This time I actually reached out, lowering the walkie in his sweaty grip as I laid a reassuring hand upon his shoulder.

"It's okay, it's going to be okay," I whispered as the needle tip touched his side.

Maybe I'm getting too old or maybe too comfortable or maybe, deep down, I just don't want to do this goddamn job anymore. But the motherfucker got the jump on me. Bounced back the second he felt the needle, giving me a hard shove at the same time.

As I fumbled backwards, three more flamethrowers ignited. And I could hear barking too... followed by the inevitable screaming.

You know, I've seen this Thing in action more than I would ever care to think about, especially in a wooded setting. That's where the flamethrowers come in. It's supposed to be a controlled burn, something to spook It back where we want It. The new Pocket Protector's work well enough too, but only in close range (for now anyway).

Though if it were up to me, we'd definitely be doing things differently. Much louder for one if you catch my drift. Unfortunately, the upper brass has frowned upon the whole "Shock   Awe" routine ever since '62, but I couldn't disagree more. The ground troops never, ever work out. 

But of course... maybe that's the point. 

After all, never squander the opportunity to see your weapon in action. We may have not made the damn Thing (well, not completely), but rest assured: It's as lethal as they come. It could also explain why I'm usually the only one to get a Protector during these missions.

But I digress. Muted gunshots joined in with the burning hot mayhem outside. Though the barks and shouting alike would eventually succumb to whimpering and crying and begging, even in the span of half a minute. 

The usual routine.

"The fuck is that Thing? How did it sound like... what is It?" Samuel shouted over the outside commotion, holding the walkie up in the air. He kept sputtering out nonsense even as I pulled out my sidearm, taking aim without hesitation.

Something loud and wet struck the cabin window, leaving a sticky crimson residue as it slid out of view. Sam jumped again, almost dropping the walkie. I took the opportunity to regain control.

"Listen goddamnit!" I shouted, pointing my pussy 9-mil around like I owned the place. "We could've done this the easy way, but I see that's not going to happen! Now I can explain every-"

I was cut off as the walkie exploded across my fucking forehead. I couldn't believe it! The guy had flung it at me, he didn't even give me a chance to monologue... they always wanted to hear the Bond villain monologue that answered everything! Hell, I sort of began to relish it over the years. The building could (in this case literally) be on fire and they still wanted answers. Always. This was definitely a first.

I almost respected it. Almost. 

As I hit the floor, there was a low rumble and the entire cabin began to shake. Before I could even gather my thoughts, the floor between us exploded into dust and splinters and smoke. My vision began to blur as I just made out one of the growths. It snaked It's impossible, ugly form skyward, rising through the fiery smoke, looming menacingly over the entirety of the cabin.

On cue, my Pocket Protector whirred to life, sending out the frequency that keeps It at bay. I heard It squeal in agony as the form rescinded. Samuel didn't waste any time. He grabbed my gun off the floor, getting ready to leave. I grasped his arm weakly and he actually stopped. For a moment, I thought he might actually save me.

Instead, he reached into my jacket and snagged my car keys and cell. The bastard. I passed out immediately afterwards.

I was out for 10 minutes, couldn't have been any longer. But it was morning now, hours later. The guy was long gone. Funny, I thought as the sun began to rise over the smoldering remains of the former cabin. I probably saved the poor chump's life.

Before I could even smile at the thought, I heard the usual trail of black vans behind me as they began to pull up. A caravan of fire trucks brought up the rear. The van doors opened in unison as they came to a stop, the occupants of the closest vehicle rushing to my aid. One of the grunts even grabbed my elbow.

"Dr. Rabinovitch, are you alri-"

"Sir, goddamnit," I cut him off as I brushed away his touch. A cheap looking cigarillo was hanging from his ear. I snagged it.

"Oh, um... any sign of the... It, ma'am... sir?" he stammered uncomfortably, pulling at his collar in the heat. Always cracked me up, these giant braindead thugs we hired, stuffed into a three piece.

 "Took off," I said, tapping my Protector. "Where's my fucking car?"

"Once we realized there was something wrong, we backtracked the GPS," the grunt started as he handed me a light. "He stuck around town for a little bit, but eventually he went... well... sir..."

I took a quick drag, but spat for the third time that morning as the moron trailed off. The smoke tasted like shit and my head began to throb again.

"I know where he went, damn it," I blurted as I stomped out the cig as my jarheads filed towards the cabin remains.

There was more than enough evidence in the glove compartment alone. Enough evidence to point him in the right direction. And if he was as sharp as he seemed, there's no way he ran off to the authorities. Hell, we are The Authority as far as the authorities were concerned.

And as for the media, well... you probably don't even want to know.

But what I really can't stop thinking about is that look on his face as he clutched that walkie. That desperate combination of fear and sadness and incredulous disregard for danger. I had seen it before. Many times. Too many goddamn times.

Whatever he heard on the other side of that radio, whatever that damn Thing was trying to sound like... he'd go looking for It.

"I know where he went," I found myself repeating, my words disappearing into the cold, smokey morning air. I began to gather my underlings, pulling them towards the lineup of cars.

"Leave the cabin for the townies," I said. "We're heading back to [Centralia](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/60zd51/everyone_in_pennsylvania_knows_about_centralia/)." </TEXT>

[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/68oyzl/centralia_pennsylvania/?st=J26NIWT0 sh=929a897d)

When we were kids, my parents would take us on day trips to Centralia. It's a little town in central Pennsylvania. It'd be just like any of the dozens of other secluded towns in central PA except for the fact that it's mostly abandoned. Some kind of underground fire that forced everyone to flee.

Mostly everyone anyway. If all of this sounds kind of familiar, it's because they made a movie about it a few years ago. Well it was a movie based on a video game, but for the film's script, they took elements from Centralia's history.

I bring this up because the success of the film turned the town into sort of a tourist trap, though the locals certainly don't think so. One glance at their Facebook page and you'll see dozens of complaints and angry rants focused on the usual "teens and hooligans" that keep trespassing, looking for a thrill. I guess I can't say I blame them.

Like I said, my parents used to take our sister and I there from time to time. This was before the film came out, so the place was just an interesting, mostly empty footnote in PA's history. My parents found it peaceful I think. They'd tell us to explore to our heart's content for an hour or two while they went looking for some alone time. We'd do our thing, though we always left in a total hurry. Weird, sure, but as a kid I didn't think much of it.

Anyway, I hadn't thought about the place in a long time. That is until a few years ago, the guy who wrote the movie came to my film school in Pitt. Nice enough guy, though he was involved in a fatal hit and run that landed him in prison. Part of a lessened sentence was coming to our school and telling a bunch of wannabe filmmakers how to get into the business. Community service I guess, though I didn't know they handed down that type of thing for manslaughter.

But I digress. The Q   A was going great  (Tarantino's a dick? Who'd a thunk it!) until somebody brought up his Centralia film. The guy smiled, kind of, before he started to wax nostalgic, telling us how his father had told him stories growing up about Centralia and how it eventually formed the outline for his script. In fact, he told us being in PA brought the old feelings back. At that point, he started getting a little glassy eyed and cut the Q   A short.

It was a little weird, sure. But things got even stranger when I ran into the guy in the bathroom. I guess the cop stationed outside the door should have been a clue. He was leaning over the sink, watching himself in the mirror when I caught his eye. Water was dripping from his face, sliding down his cheap suit and pants.

"Everything... ok?" I hesitantly asked after an awkward minute, not sure what else to say.

"Yeah," he faked a smile. "Just a long day is all."

I smiled back as he snorted and rubbed his eyes, trying to regain his composure.

"It's funny," I said, trying to keep the convo going, "you mentioning Centralia. When I was a kid, my parents used to take my sister and I there."

The faux grin left his face, a gray shadow enveloping his eyes. I stammered something, unable to properly speak. I had never seen a transformation like that before, somebody tearing off their societal mask in a flash, revealing the saddened, bloated underbelly beneath the facade.

"You would go there?" he asked slowly. "When you were a child? Your parents would take you there?"

"Yeah... to hang out I guess," I sort of laughed. "They'd go off on their own, leave us out there to explore-"

"And what did you see?"

"Um... nothing."

"Good. Good."

His voice trailed off as he took my hand, his grasp still a clammy, wet mess.

"Your parents," he started. "They're not around anymore, are they?"

"No," I answered finding it more and more difficult to meet his glance. "They died in a car accident... maybe five years ago."

"Your sister too?"

"Yeah... yes. Same thing a year later. Same highway even. Right near..."

I paused, my glance turning sideways. Suddenly a horrible coincidence that had shadowed the last six years of my life seemed like a small part in a lavish plot. I couldn't explain it then and I certainly can't explain it now. But somehow, I just knew. I always knew.

"They leave one alive," he said bluntly. "Every time." 

Before I could say anything, he continued, his grip tightening, "You know, the night of my accident, It tried to look like my dead mother."

"What?"

"I was drunk, I never denied that," he said ignoring my question. "But I swerved to try to hit It. I didn't even think twice when I saw her... It. I tried to run It over the moment I saw It on the side of the road." He paused for a moment, rubbing his temples, stifling a manic laugh. "I missed. I guess."

He released his grasp and began to head towards the paper towel dispenser, leaving me with a soaking wet hand and too many questions.

"Ever thought about going back?" he asked without even turning around.

"No," I answered carefully. "Never. Never thought there was a reason too."

"Good," he said. "And don't. That Thing they worship. It's always hungry, It always wants more." He turned around finally, looking me dead in the eye. "It never stops."

"It?"

"It," he repeated as he opened the bathroom door and prepared to exit. Before taking his leave, however, he turned around to face me one last time. But I had had enough.

"Listen dude, I don't know where you get off telling me-"

He cut me off. Smiled even.

"I understand you're angry. I was too. But if you ever do go back, well..." he trailed off. For a brief moment I thought he was just going to walk out without another word. 

"I don't know what they call It now," he finally continued, "but back then, in Centralia, everyone called It the [Crick It](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5zv4li/everyone_in_valley_forge_knows_about_the_crick_it/?ref=search_posts)." </TEXT>

It's a regional term, crick is anyway. It's just a creek. A Pennsylvania thing apparently. No idea why. But that's just the way it is:

"Don't get too close to the crick."

"A crick runs through it."

"Don't go near the crick at night."

That last one, that's the kicker. But I guess I should start with a little history.

If you've never been, Valley Forge as a park is a little different than what you might be thinking. Last year Jim Breuer came to the casino in town and started his set by saying he thought of VF as like The Alamo, some kind of fortress. The opposite couldn't be more true. Wide open fields clashing with thick patches of deep forest. There's some cabins strewn about too. Fake of course, meant to look like the ones Washington and the boys lived in (starved in?). Some fat guy in the 70's built them after he decided the park needed more authenticity. Irony I guess. Anyway, in the day time, the park is all peaceful bike rides, laughing children and picnicking families.

At night it's a little different.

I've worked in VF for almost 12 years now, since I graduated high school. I'm sort of a ranger but without a gun or cuffs or any real authority whatsoever.  They call my position an official park explorer. I guess it's the same thing as calling a mall cop a store detective. Just sounds better. Reynolds, a fellow "explorer," even made us fake business cards with a magnifying glass and a fucking tree on it. Very funny.

Reynolds was a good egg. Older fellow than me, he joined us two summer's ago after his wife passed away. Just quit his office job and joined the park. Nice enough fellow, though for a guy who lost his wife at 45, he seemed way too jovial all the time, even when he first joined us. Then again, that might just be the cynic in me talking.

Anyway, things used to be nice and quiet but a few months ago we began hearing of these stories going around amongst the local school kids. Urban legends, I guess, some of them even started asking questions about it during the school field trips.

Basically, there's a monster in the park and it only comes out at night. It blends in, weaves its way through the trees and the grass, sometimes on all fours, sometimes standing straight up and the size of a house.

The Crick It they call it. As in "It came from the crick!" or some B movie nonsense. It became kind of a joke at first amongst us old heads. "Don't go near the crick at night!" was the usual staticky cat call coming through the walkie talkies when we went on our rounds. And when newbies asked what we meant we always said the same thing:

"Oh, EVERYONE in Valley Forge knows about the Crick It!"

We'd rattle off some bullshit story about VF's very own Bigfoot that lived by the crick. It was workplace funny of course. Reynolds and I would crack up, sort of, but it wasn't exactly something you'd recite to your actual friends expecting a laugh. The real funny thing is that The Forge didn't need a monster, it was plenty weird at night as it was.

Last year a new guy quit after his first overnight, said he saw a hunched over thin man, covered in blood, wrapped in bandages. It would appear in the doorway of every cabin he passed. Crying softly and whimpering for help. Thought for sure we were pulling something on him. Not the case. He arrived back before dawn, missing his hat and talkie, said the thing started to look like his dead father, but not quite. He bailed, dropping his gear as he ran.

Looked like him, but not quite... that always kind of got me. 

There's plenty more stories like that, weird noises, weird sights. Of course, I figure that's any wooded area at night. Semi-supernatural nonsense, but nothing that ever really bites back.

'Til yesterday anyway.

Little girl and her brother went missing during the day. Parents were LIVID. As if I have some kind of sonar in my pocket.

"It's 2017," they practically said in unison towards Reynolds. "It's impossible to get lost in 2017," the mom finished looking in my direction, almost smiling.

The smile faded I imagine when she saw the look on my face. It's not that I didn't care, it's just the truth of the matter was something any park ranger (or goddamn park explorer) worth their salt could tell you: it's VERY easy to get lost in 2017 just like it's been VERY easy to get lost in the woods since man first decided to hunt. Lost and killed.

Unfortunately, I thought as I looked into the sunken eyes of the two parents before me, I knew exactly how they felt.

Well, they were in luck... sort of. Reynolds and I found the daughter the next morning. The cops arrived the night before and we ended up searching until dawn. The whole night, bumbling around, finding nothing. Just as we're about to take a little break, Reynolds and I round a corner and there she was, the sun beaming down on her through the glistening leaves. She was pale as a ghost, but otherwise seemed unharmed.

Now if you're from the area, you probably recall the story: kids were dragged off by a bear, taken alive and pulled into a cave. The boy didn't make the night but the girl escaped in the morning.

Couple problems of course: 1.) I'm twelve years into this job and I never once saw a bear in the park. Ever. I think we're just too damn close to the burbs. 2.) A bear attacked two kids and... what?... kidnapped them? Took them back to its cave to hang out?

Not likely.

See, I know what really happened... well, what the little girl claims anyway before the real officials arrived.

We got her into the administration cabin while I radioed the police on the other side of the park. Reynolds managed to find her a blanket and a juice box left over from the day camp. 

And that's when it all came pouring out, we didn't even have to prod her:

Says one second her brother was there, the next he was enveloped by the ground. She told us the dirt "became a man... but not quite," stood straight up and wrapped the boy in its arms. Told us its head was fairly normal except for the mouth. Managed to wrap its entire jaw around the boy from the waist up like a snake. She was pretty sure her brother screamed the whole time he was devoured, but was completely muffled.

We asked why she didn't run or scream herself. She told us it had her around the leg like a tentacle made of flesh and dirt and leaves. Said the whole time she felt hypnotized, she couldn't even recall how her and brother got so deep into the woods in the first place. After its meal, it began to drag her through the woods. Said it attempted to hum some Kings of Leon song her dad had been humming just a minute before they wandered away. But the pitch was all wrong. "Like air escaping a balloon," she managed to mumble before her eyes went wide, the juice box fell to the floor and she began to scream. And I mean SCREAM.

"CRICK IT! CRICK IT!" 

She was pointing at the window the whole time. The parents and I tried to calm her, grabbing her shoulders. Reynolds turned around to look at the window. I heard him gag on his own words as he stumbled backwards, almost tripping over the little girl, grabbing my shoulder and pointing too.

I looked of course. Nothing there. Only the trees.

The girl kept screaming, over and over. Cops took her away still wailing, I'm surprised they didn't try to gag her. Reynolds just sat there, clutching his hat on the front stoop of the cabin.

"You okay?" I asked as the cops pulled away.

"I just need some time off," he practically whispered. "I think it's finally... I think I just need some time off."

He actually quit the next day.

Why bring this all up? Well, in twelve years I've seen a lot of nonsense in this park.  A LOT. So when something this intense happens, yeah sure, it bugs me for a little bit. But eventually it drifts away. It has to otherwise we'd all go mad.

Go mad.

That's the feeling I can't escape as I sit here now, my usual Thursday overnight. Except this time, no Reynolds. Just me and the talkie.

A talkie that just crackled to life.

"EveryONE in VALLEY forge KNOWS aBOUT the CRICK it," a voice squealed from the other side. A voice that sounded like air escaping from a balloon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to be a fairly happy person, content and polite. Nobody has a perfect life, but mine was okay for the most part. About 4 years ago, a plow hit me while trying to make a left at a red light. I know for a fact that this moment was the exact, precise, unequivocal moment that changed everything. My car was a wreck. Drivable, but a wreck. We pulled to the side and the young-ish plow driver asked me not to call the police as he would lose his job. So I didn't. Exchanged info and that was that. DON'T EVER DO THIS. No matter how minor the accident, call the police so a record exists. Needless to say, the guy fell right off the face of the planet. I was forced to get a new car out of pocket. Long story short, this began a strange windfall of events that turned me into the much more pessimistic, untrusting individual I am today.

As for the driver, his name and face will be etched into my memory for as long as I live. I'm not a violent person and I'm certainly not fast. But if I ever run into him out in public someday, he better run as fast as he fucking can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not necessarily one that goes south, but kinda strange nonetheless. One night about a month ago, there was this young couple (late teens) sitting in the section next to mine. It was late and as I was cleaning up, getting ready to leave, the guy approaches me and says he's looking for his waitress. I should note that this bag of rocks looked, sounded and acted EXACTLY like the character Sid from The Descendants (the oldest daughter's boneheaded boyfriend). Anywho, this guy had bought a ring and wanted to, "Like, propose to my girlfriend in the cheesecake." I kinda just rolled my eyes and found his server. Long story short not only was the ring plastic but when the dessert arrived her exact response was "You're so gay... yeah, I guess" followed by his laughter which sounded like a dying donkey. As a gay man myself, I wasn't so much offended by her use of the word, but more so by the fact that in my state these two morons could get married the next day, no problem... fuckers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few years ago, I was trying to get a job as a writer on a major Hollywood film.  My agent at the time wasn't so hot, so I got drunk one New Year's Eve (also happens to be my birthday) and decided to berate the producer (I had gotten his personal cell number) right there at the shitty, sorta-collegetown bar I was at with my friends... while I didn't get the job necessarily, a few months later I was given a copy of the script asking for my input and to punch up some of the dialogue (which I was paid for)... apparently the producer in question found me "funny and ballsy."  The kicker?  I don't remember AT ALL what we talked about.  I was told by a friend later at one point I was just shouting expletives.

<TEXT> Last Tuesday morning I received a phone call from my brother.  I let it ring.  Then I got another.  And another.  Finally I answered.  My father, who lived in Melbourne, Florida, was just rushed to the hospital and thrown into the ICU.  I work in a restaurant (although, as you can see, I pretend to be a writer as well).  Tuesday, for me, is my Monday, in that I have off Sunday and Monday and work Tues., Wed., Thurs., Fri. and Saturday.  I called out.  And, as I was about to find out in the coming twelve hours, I was not going to be back to work for at least a week.

Thursday morning my brother and I woke up very early to fly down to Florida (we live in PA).  At the Philly airport, waiting for the first of four flights altogether (two there, two back), my faux-army camouflage painted flip-flop decided to come apart.  I had purchased them maybe three months prior for $2.50 at Wal-Mart.  I immediately knew that the flops un-doing would be my own as well.  Between the initial two flights, they came apart at least a dozen more times, always at the worst moment.  One hour delay on the first flight, and they come undone.  Two hour lay-over in Charlotte, and they come undone.  Finally get on the plane in Charlotte, and an older woman passes out from the extreme heat, forcing us to un-board and wait an additional hour for a new plane to arrive.  They come undone.  Twice.

When we touch down in the tiny Melbourne airport, I immediately know that there is no denying the inevitable.  My aunts face says it all.  

They come undone.  

My father, always a heavy drinker, was dying.  His liver had pretty much called it quits and, as we watched and waited, I saw the man who showed me Jaws for the first time at the wee age of 5. The man who gave me my first type writer. The man who took me to countless Phllies games. The man who rented my brother and I Robocop 2 and The Toxic Avenger without bothering to read the rating.  The man who bought us an N64 just because, as a huge Bond fan, he wanted Goldeneye.  The frustrated man who threw the same controller to the ground because, as he claimed, the Japs had something against lefties.  The drunken man who would go on tirades about O.J. Simpson and the inevitable draft that was coming.  That same drunken man hours later, falling asleep on the same goddamn chair he fell asleep on every single night, a half-drunk glass of wine usually by his side.

The man who comforted me when my agent dumped me right before signing a potential deal with Marvel two summers ago.  Crushing my dream of working for a company I have admired since he bought me that first X-Men Vs. Fantastic Four comic at the boardwalk all those years ago.  Crushing my dream of getting out of the fucking restaurant business forever.  As youll come to learn, theyre all assholes, he said, sort of laughing.  All of em.

The man who, just a few months ago, right after moving to Florida, sent me his half-finished notebook in the mail.  The thing was old and filled with scribbled anecdotes, some profound, some confusing and some a touch angry.  But despite any of that, its what is written upon that very last page he left that will forever remind me of him:

Grammo: This book has brought me great luck - Same to you! - Now finish the rest of it! - Dad

The man that I called dad was dying.

As we head for the ICU wing, they come undone for what I have decided is the last time.  I pick up the single fuck-flop and carry it with me, wandering around the sterile environment with a slight limp, but not caring at all.  The sight of my father lying in a practically comatose state, fetal position is enough to make you forget about every undone flip-flop on the planet, let alone the filthy, mud-covered one I was currently clutching in my right paw.

My brother and I stayed in Melbourne the rest of the night, all day Friday and, finally, left Saturday morning.  By this point, I had finally taken a roll of industrial medical tape to the bastard flops, wrangling them together into a grotesque mess of dirt, dead grass and debilitating odor.  But at that point, the damage had been done.

My dad was dying, and now it was just a matter of waiting.

Yesterday I received that call.  And now, Im writing this just an hour after taking down the cardboard storyboard that was hanging above my laptop.  In actuality, a beaten up Dawn of the Dead poster I flipped over to use as a giant note pad, outlining the sequel to a script Im pretty sure only five people on this planet have read.  In its place, the flip-flop, now nailed upon the wooden frame of the wall, a ghastly reminder of the worst weekend of my life.  

A reminder that no matter how bad things might seem, they could always be worse.

A few hours ago I tried to go to work but, seeing as I hadnt called to say I was home, they didnt bother putting me on the floorplan.  When I returned home, my roommate, a South American native by the name of Dave had poured three shots of Johnny Walker Blue.  One shot for me, one shot for you, one shot for your dad.  Spic tradition, he continues, is that when youre ready to let go, you pour the third shot upon the ground.  We cheersed to Rocky Paschall before throwing back our own.  And now, just three hours later, my fathers glass sits next to me.  And as I type these last few ramblings, I know I am about to go outside, into the storm currently nailing Philadelphia and pour my dads shot of 200-dollar-a-bottle whiskey upon the grass.

With love to Al Paschall.
