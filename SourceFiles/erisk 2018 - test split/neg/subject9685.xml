<TEXT> I actually just went back and rewatched it. The entire part where the camera follows Charlie around is continuous, so there are no cuts to other shots. However, they probably did cut and then edit them together to make them look continuous (I think the shots that are close ups of the door are the "cuts).  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my buddies and I were having a secret Santa party at one of the guys apartments and there were no spots available for me to park in. However, one car was parallel parked in the fire lane area so I decided to pull in behind them. I asked one of the guys that lives there if it was cool and he said that people did it all the time. 
So I go out later to put something in my car and see that my front right bumper and quarter panel are dented. 
One of the guys that lives there saw a text in a group message from a girl that lives there that her friend backed into my car. 
Am I at fault for this or is she?
Should I get her insurance information and file a claim? </TEXT>

<TITLE> My theory on one of the new Hawkmoon ornaments. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-30 18:44:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the new ornaments for all the weapons look incredible, but when I saw [this one](http://imgur.com/gallery/aT6y6) for Hawkmoon, I thought it looked amazing. Most people will say that it is a blood stain on the front, but I think that it is the [Eyasluna](http://imgur.com/gallery/YtVf3) transitioning into the Hawkmoon. The in-game description of Eyasluna reads "One day, young hawk, thou shalt sail beneath the silvered moon" and everyone calls Eyasluna "Baby Hawkmoon." The red color on the Hawkmoon with the ornament matches that of the Eyasluna. If this is the case, then it is a really interesting story behind Hawkmoon. 

TL;DR The Hawkmoon with the "blood stain" ornament is actually Eyasluna transitioning into Hawkmoon

Edit: Wow! It seems like a lot of people agree! After looking through the comments, I also agree with the idea that Hawkmoon's paint is chipping away to reveal the old red Eyasluna coat of paint.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 3, my mom and I were picking up my older brother from school. As we were walking home, I decided that running away from my mom was a great idea. I was looking back at my mom and as soon as I turned around, my forehead connected with the notch on the side of a fire hydrant. My mom's white t-shirt was completely stained red after that. Still have that scar on my forehead today! </TEXT>
