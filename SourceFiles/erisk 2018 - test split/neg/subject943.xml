<TEXT> I used to have night terrors as a kid. 



They were incredibly vivid, so real that it felt like hell itself had somehow found a way to creep into my bedroom to torment me. My parents werent particularly fussed about them, unless of course, my screams woke them up. Ill never forget the one night my dad got really upset with me. He didnt care about the sharp-toothed, formless thing stuck in the corner of my room, stating in detail how it was going to gut me. He only cared about the fact that I was keeping the rest of the household out of their own peaceful dreams. He was fed up. Hed grabbed me by my shoulders and shaken me until the nightmarish thing disappeared, leaving nothing but tears on my cheeks and embarrassment in my heart.



Monsters are not real! He practically screamed those words at me. Those creatures are all in your head, Alexandria! In your head! Its not real life! Youre making it up! They dont exist!


 I was seven. Ever since then, Id done everything I could to overcome that fear that robbed me of sleep and peace. I feared the night. I detested it, because I knew that once everything went dark, they would come for me. So I decided to greet them with valour, or as much of it as my young self could muster at that age. I stubbornly decided to sleep with my bedside lamp off, plunging my room into blackness that remained when I woke to that awful, nocturnal world of teeth and eyes. When those things visited, I refused to scream. I closed my eyes, breathed really deeply and waited until I could feel my heartbeat begin to steady. It took a few tries, but I managed to snap myself out of it pretty quickly. On my first real triumph, Id saluted the vanquished demon with my middle finger, which, even at seven years old, seemed like an appropriate send-off. 



I hardened myself, I guess, partly in thanks to my father, who was a difficult man for whom fear was weakness and weakness was unacceptable. He was ex-military, who couldnt seem to leave the severity of war on the battlefield. He carried it with him, even when at home with his family. As a result, my sibling and I were forced to learn the hard facts of life. People steal and harm and kill. We had to be prepared. By eleven, Id already had a reasonable grip on self-defence and was learning how to use a firearm. By thirteen, Id found my accuracy.


 None of these things helped when our family was hijacked on the side of the road when I was fifteen. 

I never really knew whether or not my dad really loved me, if him being tough on me when it came to those lessons was simply because he cared, or because he was disappointed in me. I never got the chance to find out. 

Those lessons did nothing to prevent the bullet from tearing through my fathers skull and ending his life. 


That day, he taught me something. He showed me first-hand, just what real evil looked like. Two men, willing to kill another in front of his wife and children for some second-hand piece-of-shit car. That was my first glimpse into what evil really was. 
Something in me snapped that day. Id never experienced hate as I did then. Not only for the loss of my father, but for the look in the eyes of those men: they looked triumphant, as though revelling in toting their power to take life above their victims, taunting and mocking. Those eyes reminded me of those nights, the ones eight years prior that still left horror stained in my mind. 


I specifically picked a college as far away from home as I could get while still remaining in the country. I called my mom every now and again, met up with my brother on occasion, but I needed the freedom from everything that had happened, that pain. It was there that I met my second family. I made lots of friends, was studying something I truly loved and somehow managed to get my shit together. One of the people I was closest to was Connor Lowell. He was the kind of person that made you feel guilty for not being nice enough. I gravitated towards that kindness, perhaps because of my unintentional coldness and sarcasm, I dont know. But he was one of my best friends. 


One day I got a call from Connors mom. Connor hadnt come home one night and she was worried. My number was the only one she knew out of all his friends, so I assured her it was probably nothing and called everyone else. No one had seen him. The call back to his mom was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to do. 



The police were dry on leads, saying that the kid has simply vanished without a trace. I got angry because that was impossible. I didnt tell anyone I was conducting my own investigation. I asked his mom if I could use his laptop, and she agreed. It must have been too painful for her to keep it. I began analysing all of Connors online activities. Most of it was typical guy stuff: boredom-induced Google searches, porn, price-checks on cars, downloads for music, a few games and porn. Then I noticed an oddly-named app. Id thought it was a game initially but there was something fishy about the size of the file. It was incongruent for a game. I tried opening it and was immediately thrown back out. After a second attempt, the laptop shut down.
That was when I took the laptop to Patrick. 


Patrick Siler was in my third year computer sciences class in college. Or at least, he was there when he wasnt bunking out on the lawns, eating weed brownies or hacking into the schools administration system to cause chaos. We werent friends, but I knew enough about him to know he loved a challenge when it came to anything tech, and that he was good. Great, actually. I managed to track him down and brought the laptop with me. After a heated five-minute argument that ended when I pulled out a check, he finally agreed to try and crack the laptop. He got it working again and managed to decrypt the game after a day.
When he called me to collect it, his voice was panicked and he only managed to yell, Get here right fucking now! before hanging up. 


Turns out the game was a piece of sophisticated spyware. A lot of the technological terms were above my comprehension, but in laymans terms, this programme carried a Trojan that corrupted all of the data on Connors laptop. It was able to get into every account he accessed after it was installed his email, bank account, everything. It also had access to his laptops Skye cam. It tracked his geographical location. 



Patrick had contacted his friends, a group of fellow hackers of varying skill whod decided to form an exclusive group dedicated to accessing confidential information for a price, and none of them were able to backtrack the feed to see where it led, where the information was being sent to. Their unanimous advice was to destroy it and stop looking. Nothing that suspicious and advanced came from a mind of good intention. I agreed to destroy the laptop but not to stop looking. With their help we managed to link the game to its site of origin before we trashed it. 



The site led us to the deep web. 


My stomach dropped at what I saw. There were ads for the most disturbing things. 



Humans. 

Human body parts. 

Videos showing humans losing their body parts.


 Ritualistic animal slaughter. 

Cannibalism social groups and recipe-swap forums. 


One even had photos of people to be used as drug mules at airports. Like it was a freaking catalogue to pick and choose from. Another was a site for cops to brag about the things they got away with on the job, ranging from theft to rape to murder. 



One of the guys got up and left the room, unable to look at the photos and video clips anymore. I forced myself to keep searching. The particular site the game was linked to boasted a following of almost one million people. It was a site much like Reddit. There were subsections for different topics, everything from taboo porn to drug rings. One of them was a virtual arena, like an online cinema. The format was reminiscent of YouTube, except that the entire thing had a very prominent theme with the content. There were recommended videos on the sidebar, videos ranked as the most popular at the top. The second one caught my eye. 



That was because the thumbnail showed a picture of Connor, naked, bloodied, and looking utterly broken. 
I had to try very hard not the smash my fist through the screen.
He was being advertised as the main event for the next screening. Probably beaten as some kind of teaser trailer for the sick audience. According to the details, it was happening in a week from then. One of the videos showed a creepy-looking older man with tattoos covering much of his skin. One of the guys recognised him as the owner of a tattoo shop near to where he lived. Hed seen him a few times and if you could, youd realise why those few instances were enough to brand that face in his mind forever. 



So we decided that was as good a place as any to start. Plus, we figured that because the shop was usually empty, we could easily overpower this guy as we would be five to one. The others and I decided to meet up a street away from the shop.


The thought seems laughable now because of course he wasnt alone.



We went in the evening, just as the sun was dying, wanting to be discreet but still have a bit of sunlight on our side. We were impulsive, we were stupid. But people tend to be careless in their anger. And the content of that dark version of the internet had us all angrier than wed ever been before. The internet mercenaries didnt want to contact the police, fearing their own illegal means would be exposed, so we went in alone. 
We were jumped the second all of us were across the threshold.


We had bags thrown over our heads as what must have been at least five heavily-muscled men restrained us and led us down some staircase. We were separated and thrown into separate cells; I figured out they were barred and not cement-walled because my specific captor grabbed my head and smashed it against the steel. I hadnt even had a chance to use the pocketknife Id brought. They beat us for a while, until we were all pretty well-acquainted with the sounds of one anothers screams. I tried being careful to orient my body so he wouldnt hit anything too vital. I could hear the crack of bone, though I knew it wasnt mine. 



A voice finally told them to stop, coloured by amusement and not horror or any sort of emotion that a human might be expected to experience when watching a bunch of kids being severely beaten. We were relieved of the bags and locked in our respective cells. I took inventory of my body, probing and poking to make sure nothing was broken. Most of the damage was done to my torso. My ribs felt like they were on fire, and I could barely move my arms but nothing appeared broken. There was blood smeared all over the dirty floor of my cell I could taste it in my mouth, feel it run down my face. Looking around, I could see the others seemed okay enough except one. 



Simon. 



He was the youngest of all of us, a kid at eighteen. He was also the smallest, skinny and still pulling for puberty to hit him with a parlour trick. He lay unmoving in his cell two down from me, his clothes stuck to his body with his blood. He was bleeding more than the rest of us. 


Check on him! I yelled at Patrick, whose cell was adjacent to his. He dragged himself to the bars and stuck his arm through, trying to shake Simon. He didnt move. The pool of blood around him was growing in circumference, alarmingly so, but no matter how many times we screamed and hit the bars, no one came. I knew they wouldnt. But still, fighting a lost battle felt better than just not fighting at all.


A day passed. 


Then two. They came and collected Simons body. One of the guards actually inhaled deeply when removing the body, savouring the smell of death. I nearly vomited.


Three. 


They brought us water in dog bowls and no food. None of us wanted to drink it, and when another one of the guys Jordan, was his name threw his in the face of the guard who brought it, the man dragged him from his cell and punched him so hard his eyes rolled into the back of his skull. He then pulled out a length of rope fashioned into a crude leash. 


Little doggies are not meant to misbehave like that. His smile was reptilian. Doggies need to be taught a lesson.


 He secured an end of the rope to a beam that ran across the ceiling.


Then he hung Jordan right in front of us. 


Eric, the fourth guy, threw up in his cell. Patricks eyes shone with tears. I stayed quiet. I hadnt known them very long but having these guys killed right in front of me . . . I was enraged beyond description. 



They left us with the body for another day. The pocketknife I kept in my pocket burned where it lay, and my hand itched to use it. I noted that there were the same two guys who came to give us water each day. They finally brought us plain bread, probably wanting our deaths to be entertaining and not at the hands of something as banal as starvation. The guys couldnt bring themselves to eat but I wolfed mine down. Patrick looked at me with disgust but I didnt care. I needed my strength. Eric was in the cell directly next to mine. I had an idea but I needed him to trust me. I explained it in a hushed whisper. He nodded, face pale and I could tell he was afraid. I promised him he would be okay. 



When we brought out next meals, he threw his in the face of the guard, just as Jordan had done. The man shouted, moving in to open Erics cell. Did your friends death not teach you anything, kid? Slow learner, are you? Eric slunk against the bars of my cell. I prayed he would remember what I told him to do. He must have, because he kicked the guard in the nuts, drawing out a pained groan. The hulking man lunged at Eric, who ducked just as I took up my position at the bars. Time seemed to slow. I breathed in and out slowly, slowed my racing heartbeat, just like I used to do, waiting.



The timing was exceptional. Eric dropped just as the man ran into the bars . . . his chest impaled on my knife blade. I pulled my arm back out from between the bars. He was still breathing. By some miracle I hadn't killed him. Eric grabbed the dog bowl and smashed it over the guys head, incapacitating him. Get the keys! I yelled. Eric scrambled to get them from where they still rested in the keyhole of his cell. He unlocked our cells. We made our way through the door, only to run into the second guard.
This one was even bigger than the first. He hit me first, sending me sprawling, the knife flying out of my hand. Patrick dove for it while Eric tried his best to distract the man. He slashed through the flesh of the mans thigh, and he screamed, dropping Eric, who hed been lifting in a choke hold. He grabbed a hold of Patrick, who wasted no time in slashing his wrist. He let go of him immediately, cradling his bleeding wrist. Patrick then sweep-kicked his legs out from under him, and straddled him, pressing the tip of my knife against his throat. 


Where are the others?


The man only laughed in reply: an ugly, harsh sound. Im not saying anything.


Yeah?


Yes.


Okay, by choice, but if that doesnt change I can make sure you lose the ability to say anything ever again. 


The man snarled. In response, Patrick pressed the knife harder, drawing a fine rivulet of blood. The man grunted but still didnt say anything. I took the knife from Patrick and buried it in the guards shoulder. He yelled out. Then I dragged it down, struggling through his thick, muscled flesh. The thought of what I was doing sickened me, but I knew we needed that information. For Connor. For revenge for what happened to Jordan and Simon and countless other people. 



We can make this really slow. Or I can just  I stopped what I was doing and twisted the knife. Patrick threw his hand over his mouth to muffle the screams. 



How many of you are here? he asked roughly. 


The man nodded and Patrick slowly took his hand away. 



Just us two. The rest went out to get more from distribution.


More what? He asked.


Of the drug. Incredibly, the mans face lit up. The cure for mankind. Theyre getting more.



What is this drug and where is the distribution plant? 


Silence again, lips pressed together in sudden resolution. I glanced at Patrick, who placed both hands over the mans mouth and nodded at me. I yanked the knife out hard. After that, he sang like a canary. We learned a lot. About where the distribution centre was, what the drug was, where the arena was. Where Connor and about thirty other people were being imprisoned. He also explained that they were waiting for us because they knew we were looking. That fucking laptop. They were monitoring us, looking at the people we were close to, which is why I knew they would try and target Leo. He also told us that if we really wanted to know about what that drug was, we could go and check in another little room. We took him with us, me angling the knife at his back the entire time to stave off any foolish ideas while Patrick and Eric flanked his sides. We opened the door a crack and something heavy threw its weight back against it. There were screams coming from the person on the other side of the door, screams that sound feral, animalistic. The person was begging for "more of it", saying they would gouge out their eyes if they didn't get it. My blood ran cold. That person's voice was brimming with complete and utter madness. What I didn't tell Patrick was that in the short glimpse into the room we were allotted, I saw Simon's corpse. 

Half-eaten.



Patrick and I argued about what to do with the guards and the madman in the room. I convinced him not to kill the two because they didnt deserve that kindness. We were in over our heads and we needed help. I told them to get away, that I would stay and talk to the cops, saying that only Simon and Jordan came with me. I could keep the police off their trails. I knew that Patrick and Eric had rather undesirable offences theyd get jailed for. Minor, sure, but they added up. They thanked me, and after we tied the two men up, they left with the promise of a favour each. 


I was questioned and eventually released. They opened an investigation, but I know they wont get anywhere. I didnt tell them where the arena was just yet. I know that if they start sniffing around, the entire thing will be moved before they even touch them. And Connor, along with a lot of other innocent people will be out of reach. I washed up in the bathroom of a random gas station rest room, where I finally allowed myself to break down. I made sure I purged myself of every hint of despair so that I could continue on clear-headed. I got something to eat, then made my way over to my apartment.


Im wrung out now, bled dry, on the brink of losing my faith in humanity. Because for the first time in almost fifteen years I felt that ancient, buried fear. I keep on hearing my fathers voice in my head: *Those creatures are all in your head, Alexandria! In your head! Its not real life! Youre making it up! They dont exist!*, but I realise now that they do indeed exist, its not in my head, it is real life. They exist all around us. And we will never truly know who they are. 


That kind stranger on the bus?



A neighbour?



A family member?


A friend?


Maybe it's you.


The internet is a playground for them, their outlet for the inhumanity they lock up on a daily basis that they will never allow the world to see. We live in a world of night terrors. Those terrifying, evil creatures exist and the only difference is they wear human skins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks. Yeah, Bosworth was one tough motherfucker. I'm not really sure, he was taken in during the raid and then sent to a clinic as well, and obviously the doctors can't divulge the details but I can only assume that he must have been injected/fed some chemical or hormone concoction like Dylan was? They must have manipulated his biology somehow coz that shit ain't natural.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was far worse than Dylan was because he was kidnapped at a younger age . . . he was too psychologically damaged to discern for himself what he actually wanted to do, plus he basically grew up with no decent moral compass. As for his resistance to pain I am guessing that like Dylan, they fed him some hormone-chemical concoction except that his was meant to numb him to pain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good analysis and yep Illusionera is right. I spoke to one of the officers who brought Bosworth in. He was taken from his own family at a much younger age, so he was more malleable than Dylan  -he had completely lost his sense of identity. As for his bionic-like resistance to pain . . . I can only guess that they fed him with some kind of chemical-hormone shit that numbed him to feeling? </TEXT>

**Part 2**: https://redd.it/699a3p


I had never experienced terror as vividly as I did while being dragged down the staircase. 


I was too busy trying to fight Bosworth to notice exactly where I was being taken, but I knew for a fact that it would not be anywhere pleasant. My only calming thought was that maybe they wouldnt find Dylan. Maybe Zander could get the police here before they started searching for him. 

As for my own safety and survival . . . hope had begun to dwindle. 

I didnt care.


 As long as Dylan managed to get out and find some way to put his life back together.


 They threw me into the cellar. It took me a few moments to identify the room from the rows of preserved wines that formed a labyrinth in the mouldy darkness. There were no windows in the cellar. While the upper floor of the house was magnificent in architecture and dcor, it seemed that this cellar was built in a hurry, the poor structural integrity and uneven stonework a jarring contrast from the more expertly-crafted main rooms of the home. I landed against one of the shelves, my head slamming hard against a corner. My vision splintered, pain pounding through my skull where it was still bruised from the week before. I quickly rose to my feet though, determined to not just take whatever they were planning for me. I could just about make out their light-kissed forms thanks to the illumination spilling in through the open door, but it took a while before my eyes fully adjusted to the sudden darkness. 


Margery was still humming the tune to that nursery rhyme, swaying back and forth slightly as she stalked towards me. The most awful thing about Margery Fitzwillys voice was that the tone itself might conjure up feelings of safety and maternal comfort, had it not been laced with madness just below the surface. Even now, her voice began to change, taking on a childlike quality that made the hair on my arms stand up.


 My lovely little flower, so naughty. What am I going to do with you? And such naughtiness right before the party tonight! *What party?*  She began to circle me, her strides long and stilted, her back hunched slightly. She touched the tips of her thumb and index finger to her chin, feigning indecision. My eyes followed her every movement, my fists balled up and ready. 

You were such a wonderful nanny to my Jaime. I shall hate having to punish you.


His name is not Jaime! I screamed back at her. He is not a baby at all and he is not your child! 

Bosworth came striding forward but Margery held her hand out to fend him off. 

Not yet. She cooed. Our nanny doesnt know what shes talking about. She is going to apologise and all will go back to how it once was.


I am not going to apologise! I knew that this was probably not the smartest idea but a week of this horror had outstripped any sense of self-preservation I had left. You can do whatever you want to me but you arent going to get away with it. You arent going to get me to play along with your sick games anymore! I wont do it! 


She clicked her tongue to the roof of her mouth and shook her head in amusement. 

Yes you will. Because you seem a smart girl and you know what happened to the other girls and boys who just werent quite smart enough. You wont make their same mistakes, dearie. Those precious little flowers.


Fuck you, lady. I said dryly.


 Her smile had begun to droop again. Id learned to loathe the slacking of her grin, experience deemed it an omen of something terrible to come. It always was. She suddenly grabbed a fistful of my hair and yanked it back hard. I cried out.


 Apologise! She screamed, spit flying onto my face. 

Fuck off.


 She pulled harder, taking her other hand and pressing her talon-like nails into the skin of my throat. Her voice raised an octave. 


APOLOGISE AT ONCE! 

I pried her claw from my throat and elbowed her hard in the stomach. She fell back shrieking. I decided to make one final, brazen attempt at escape and ran full force at Bosworth. I landed a blow against his cheekbone but it was like he couldnt feel anything at all and I am not a soft-puncher. He simply grabbed me again, spinning me around and guiding me to a chair where he tied me up, my wrists attached to the arms. I didnt go quietly and he must have had a few wicked-looking scratches over his already-scarred face. I smiled a little at that.


 Margery began crawling toward me on all-fours. The bones of her skeletal frame poked through the billowing material of her floral dress, her hair was straggled and there was still blood all over her face. She was still grinning, still lurking toward me, taking on the likeliness of an insect. She swung her head from side to side, the movement growing more erratic the closer she got to me. 

My patience is wearing thin, dear. Apologise. We could still work things out, still be family again.


You are nothing more than a psychotic old woman who ruined the life of another human being but is too blinded by her own insanity to see it. I will never be part of this sorry excuse for a family. And youre either gonna end up dead or arrested by the end of the night.


 She growled, lunging toward me. I raised my foot and caught her in the throat. She keeled over, wheezing, and I prayed to anyone listening that Id crushed her trachea. Bosworth let out an unintelligible scream, then ran to her side. I looked on hopefully. But she still got up. She was laughing through her hissing and gasping, using up any breath she managed to draw in on that ugly cackle. 

Party time! Party time! She croaked out. She was still holding her throat and was beginning to walk out backwards, still staring at me as she laughed, eventually edging out of the door, Bosworth following her. There was nothing but poor light and silence for several long moments, then I heard footsteps. 

Slow, deliberate footsteps. 

A hunters tread. 

Lionel Fitzwilly was entering the cellar, a hammer glinting in his right hand. 

Since I d been in their home, I had never heard him speak a single word. Somehow that was almost as frightening as his wifes constant chirping and singing. He walked excruciatingly slowly. 


There is something oppressive about the waiting silence between the present moment and  your eminent torture. I cant really describe it.  The anticipation of the agony you know will surely follow is so consuming and overwhelming that the only way to escape it is to give in to the numbness of acquiescence. I was going to die. I was going to die here, in this hole at the hands of a deranged old man and his hammer. A million thoughts began to race through my mind. Faces of loved ones, the sound of my friends voices, the dreams I had yet to pursue, unrealised ambitions, the longing for a future unlived . . . it all came crashing into my mind until my thoughts seemed to shatter, then caress the blackness of my mind like stars pressed against a night sky. 

Id always loved the stars. 

They seemed to beautiful, so untethered to the evils of this earth and I wondered, even as I sat there shaking, if what they said was true, if our souls would go on to become one with the celestial once leaving our earthly bodies. 

I hoped so. I hoped for that beauty after these ugly horrors. 


Well, if I was gonna go down, I was gonna down go fighting.


 So, I said casually to the approaching man with the hammer. Is this what usually happens? You do your wifes dirty work for her, watch her torture and remake people? I bet thats what she did to you. Or were you just born a bitch? 


Not my smartest comment but still felt good at the time. By then hed reached me. I tried to kick out at him but he was surprisingly spry for such an old man, and strong too, as he gripped each leg and sat down. He moved the one beneath his weight, trapping it there, then removed the boot from the foot of the other. For the first time, I saw the ghost of a smile play at his lips. 

Lets take a look at these little piggies, eh? He removed my sock. He placed my wiggling foot on the ground, securing it there with his one hand and using the dominant one to hold the hammer. I knew what was happening, but until I saw him rear back his hand, until I felt that first blow shatter my big toe, I didnt believe it was actually happening. 

This little piggy went to the market. He brought the hammer down, hard, and a strangled scream tore itself from my throat as I felt my toe bashed open. He hit my foot again. And again. And again. I could feel the break of the bone, hear the wet slickness of the hammer as it was pulled back from my mangled flesh. It dripped blood on my foot. Then he moved it a little. 


This little piggy stayed at home. He hit the second one. I bit my lip, trying to hold back the screams, but they still slipped out. The pain was incredible. I was panting, trying to breathe through it.


 Ha, thats all youve got? The pain must have killed off the last of my brain cells.

 He suddenly stood up, levelling the hammer with my face. 

Night-night. He said, preparing to hit me in the face. I closed my eyes, steeling myself. 

All of a sudden I heard Lionel grunt and felt the rush of air brush my face as he was knocked to the ground. I opened my eyes. 

Zander was on top of him, struggling with him to get the hammer.

 It only took him a few seconds to grab hold of the thing and hit Lionel against the head with it. It only took a few blows before the old man stopped twitching. Zander got up, breathing hard, face splattered with blood. 

You okay? 

I nodded, wincing at the pain in my foot. Neither of us said anything for several moments. Then, he smiled wryly. 

You know, Teresa, if you wanted to see me again all you had to do was make a date. I appreciate the effort but getting kidnapped by two psychos is a little much, dont you think?


Shut the fuck up and untie me. Thanks, by the way.


Dont mention it. He worked at the rope securing my wrists. Actually, yes, mention it. It was a fucking nightmare getting in here. There are a lot of insane people on this premises. I had to sneak in.


Wait, what? 

He lifted my arm over his shoulder and helped me up. 


Theyre having some sort of party. There are a whole bunch of crazy old people, all bringing adults dressed as babies or small children. 

Holy shit. 

The police arrested them all, right?


No. The police arent coming. 

My heart sank. 

But . . . what? Why? I thought you 


They wouldnt believe me. I sounded like a drunken twenty year old kid making a prank call. I had vague snippets of information, no details, and what I had was already ridiculous enough. I wouldnt have believed me. I wouldnt have believed you if I didnt know you. If I hadnt seen this for myself.


Call them now!


My phones dead.


Youre . . . youre serious? 


He nodded sagely.


So were on our own?


Were on our own.


Damn. 

I could walk but I couldnt put much weight on my left foot. When we reached the light, I nearly passed out. My foot was unrecognisable. The flesh hung off the bones of my two toes. Zander wrapped it up with some material he tore from  his shirt. 

That bastard. He said as he bandaged it up. 

We have to get to Dylan before she finds him. I said urgently.

Zanders grey eyes went wide. Dylans really here? 

I nodded. Yes and theres something very wrong with him, Zander. They . . . messed him up. We need to get him out.


Then were gonna get him out. His voice was certain, blazing with a confidence I was sure was meant to convince himself more than convince me. Where is he?


The nursery. I lead the way there. We did our best to be as quiet as possible. The party was being hosted in the main dining room, so we could sneak past them through the kitchen without being seen as long as we were silent. While in the kitchen, Zander grabbed a knife off the counter. We made it to the nursery which was still dark. For some or other reason, I didnt want to turn the light on. 

Instinct proved correct because when Zander flipped the light switch, there she was. 

It was almost as though I could feel her presence before I saw her, crouched in the corner, cradling Dylan as she sang Three Blind Mice. 

Bosworth materialised from behind the door and knocked me to the side, slamming his foot down hard on my femur bone. I heard it crack, felt the break of bone through skin and I screamed. Zander was no match for him either, and was soon subdued, bloody and held in a lock before Margery.

 She put Dylan aside and crawled towards him, a spoon in her hand, the lyrics to that fucking song still dancing on  her lips. 

Ah, my three little mice. She looked at Dylan, Zander and I all in turn. Then she pressed the back of the spoon against Zander s cheekbone. Little mice but theyre not . . . not blind, are they? 


Despite the agony coursing through me, I dragged myself towards where the fallen knife lay a few feet behind Bosworth because I *knew* what was coming next. I knew what this bitch was about to do.

 I need my three mice blind. She giggled. I had just gripped the handle of the knife when Zander began to scream. 

She was gouging out his right eye with the spoon. 

I could actually hear the disgusting wet sounds and I propelled myself to go faster. From the corner of the room, for the very first time, I could hear Dylan crying. Shed just dug out Zanders eyeball when I reached Bosworth and buried the knife to the hilt in his calf. Then I dragged it down, tearing his flesh. He yelped, dropping Zander. He turned to face me and I slashed out again, slicing his hands whenever he tried to bring them near me. I delivered quick stabs to his legs, trying to get him to fall down, to get him out of the way so I could get to Margery. But I didnt have to. She suddenly began screaming, and both of us turned to watch as Dylan lashed out at her. 

Bosworth looked confused, as though he couldnt process what was happening. Zander lay on the floor, his head surrounded by a halo of blood as he clutched at his empty eye socket. Margery ran out, Dylan chasing after her on unsteady legs. Bosworth slowly walked after them, still looking confused. I crawled over to Zander, bringing his head onto my lap. I looked around and picked up one of Dylans  stretched baby fleeces, wrapping it across his eyes and around his head to staunch the blood-flow.

 He was hysterical.

 I grabbed his hands, bringing them to my face, moving his fingers along the angles and curves of it, telling him that it was ok, I was here and it was going to be fine. I could hear chaos erupting from the dining room.

 I needed to do something, get to a phone somehow. One of those people had to be carrying one. I needed to call an ambulance.

 I reassured Zander that I would be back soon, and dragged myself to the door, across the hall until I could see into the dining room. 

Dylan was strangling Margery in full view of all the guests.

 As though seeing the display snapped something in all of the other children, they all began attacking their captors. It was pure, unabated pandemonium. People were being torn apart by nails and teeth. I could see the years of torment manifest in bloody carnage as screams filled the mansion dining hall. Bodies already lay scattered across the lush carpets, which was quickly soaking up with blood. I crawled to the nearest body, a gentleman dressed in expensive attire that suggested the possession of a phone on his person. I searched his body until I found it and called the police, telling them to send an ambulance immediately.

 I couldnt stand the sight and sounds of the party any longer, so I crawled back to the nursery, finding Zander and waiting with him until I could hear the sirens outside. 

Dylan appeared in the doorway shortly after. He just stood there for a moment.

 Then, he spoke. 

His voice sounded as unsteady as his steps had looked, voice rusted from disuse but still, he made the effort. 

We . . . were back. The three of us . . . 


I could feel tears rolling down my cheeks as I nodded. He came walking over to us slowly, crying himself. Then he sat down beside me and clutched Zanders hand, putting his head on my shoulder, weeping. Thats how we stayed, bloodily reunited after ten years, after unspeakable horrors, each of us bearing different wounds that bound us to that night forever.

 Each of us lending and borrowing strength from each other. 

We stayed that way, unmoving, until the cops finally came rushing into the nursery.

***
I wish I could say it was over. 


But I dont think something like this ever truly ends, not really. 

The Fitzwillys madness had bled into our lives and I dont think the stain will ever truly go away. Well carry that brokenness with us for the rest of our lives. But at least we have lives to live out. 

Were lucky, I guess.

 Zander and I, though certainly bloodier than Dylan, had the lesser evil wounds. We were both set to recover, though it will take months for me to be able to walk properly again and Zander has to have a fake eye. 

But Dylan . . . Dylan was malnourished for years. Besides his obvious malnourishment, the formula they fed him contained hormones that stunted his growth and the doctors had to do extensive tests to figure out how to fix the damage to his body. That too, was minor in comparison to his psychological strain. He still lives his nightmare in and out of sleep. But were there for him. Zander and I, we visit him at the clinic whenever we get a chance to. Were spending more time together again as well, mending our friendship. 

I dont think you can live through what we did with someone and not feel tethered to them. 

Were strong for one another, all three of us. 

Baby steps, day by day, were fixing each other. 

The strangest thing is that despite everything that happened to us, the detail I remember the most, the one that will stay with me forever, is Margerys rose garden. Not the sound of cracking bones, not the sight of flesh being ripped apart, not Margery's eyes, the colourless depths of inhumanity. The roses. I hadnt noticed the first day I arrived. But I noticed as they carried me out on a stretcher. 

In my delirium, in that eddied world of pain and flashing lights and screams I remember the roses growing in a little patch along the walkway. 

Beautiful, well-kept. 

Much like the rose garden she once maintained a decade ago.

 A near four-dozen of them. 

It was only once the police spoke to us that everything clicked into place.

 Margery and Lionel Fitzwilly were suspected to have kidnapped and tortured forty-five young adults. 

I could hear Margerys voice in my head singing,  * . . . you seem a smart girl and you know what happened to the other girls and boys who just werent quite smart enough. You wont make their same mistakes, dearie. Those precious little flowers.*

 Forty-five roses for forty-five deaths. The other nannies. 

Forty-five roses and I would not be the forty-sixth. </TEXT>

*"Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop*

*When the wind blows, the cradle will rock*

*When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall*

*And down will come baby, cradle and all . . ."*

I must have sung that one a thousand times, Margery joining in with no small amount of gusto. 

That was my first task. 

Put precious Jaime to bed. And Jaime loves nursery rhymes, so I was forced to sing to him as I rocked him in my arms and Margery danced to the tune, eyes closed, arms whirling. Lionel and Bosworth were nowhere to be found. Dylan took it all without so much as a minuscule shift in his expression. I studied his face as I held him, trying to gage his thoughts, trying to peer into his state of mind and wordlessly ask him about the horrors he had endured in the last decade. 

There was nothing. I had prayed to see anger in those brown depths, hatred toward his captors maybe, embers of resolve but it was as if all the fight had gone out of him. He seemed . . . defeated. Dead. My heart clenched. 

Eventually, Dylans eyes began to droop and he nestled into my chest as though he were a real baby. For the briefest of moments I thought I could feel him squeeze my arms quickly a sign of recognition or a plea for help. But my fleeting hope disappeared once I realized he had actually fallen asleep. 

Hed been a chubby kid, but there was so little of him now that I knew I wouldnt need help lifting him. He was so malnourished that I barely struggled to carry him to his crib. It was marginally bigger than a regular one and my heart broke at the thought of him lying here for years, the implications for not only his physical health but his psyche as well. 

This was humiliating. 

What were they playing at? Forcing a grown man to pretend to be a baby? 

After I put him down, I felt Margerys claw-like hand clasp my shoulder. 

He is so precious, my little boy. I can see that youve grown attached to him already. There is a bond. Her overly-animated voice chirped in my ear, her mouth so close to my face I could smell something rancid on her breath. She giggled in that creepy way of hers, a sound that bore no trace of happiness or joy, but rather seemed to slowly scrape away at my sanity. Like nails on a chalkboard. 

You have been the only nanny so far who has been so helpful. 

She placed her chin on my neck, its boniness digging into my skin. Revulsion washed over me in waves and I had to force myself not to shake off her grip. 

You are the only one that seems to connect with our little Jaime. The others were all so . . . Here she sighed dramatically, her impossibly wide grin tilting downwards. Naughty. She giggled again, squeezing my shoulder. But youre a good little girlie, arent you? Youre not going to disappoint us like they did. You are going to stay with us, become part of our family. Were so excited to have you here. 

I could hear the blood pound in my ears. 

What . . . what happened to the other nannies? I asked quietly. 

Margerys smile grew even wider, more malicious. 

Oh, we had to let them go. But theyre safe, theyre sorry, theyre so, so beautiful now. She pinched my cheek. Lovely rose of a young woman, you are. 

Then she practically leaped away from me and began chanting Ring-Around-The-Rosie, winking at me before skipping out of the nursery. Only once she left did I release the breath Id been holding. 

I had to stay sane, strong.

I couldnt fall apart.

I couldnt cry.

I couldnt freak out. I needed to keep my head if I was going to get us both out of here. 

I was offered a guest bedroom but told them Id rather sleep in the babys room, in case he woke in the middle of the night or something. Margery assured me that Jaime never did that, he was not one of those naughty toddlers. I spent the entire day scoping out the room, looking for hidden cameras as subtly as I could. I found two, one hidden between the knickknacks of a shelf and the other in the button of a teddy bear. I pretended to check on him as he slept, but I was actually poking at Dylan, trying to wake him. 

I wasnt sure how I was going to get rid of the cameras without them noticing, but I couldnt wait until Id come up with a good enough idea to talk to him. 

He was practically comatose. He didnt budge, not an inch, not even when I pinched him so hard his skin bruised. It was almost as if theyd drugged him. 

I was invited to have supper with them a few hours later. It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to endure, sitting opposite them, watching them eat and carry on as though they had not destroyed the life of my best friend. I thought of his parents, how heartbroken they were when their sons case was closed. A lump formed in my throat. 

No.

I couldnt be sentimental. I couldnt be weak, not if I wanted to survive. If I wanted to get out of this, I had to be calm and I had to be clever. 

I dragged my fork through the mashed potato on my plate, not intending to eat anything these monsters were serving me. I didnt drink anything, either. I went to the bathroom or kitchen and drank water from the tap if I got thirsty. I cleared my throat politely. Margery stopped her singing and looked at me expectantly, food crested around her mouth which still hung open mid-song. 

That damn woman could never stop singing.

Um, I had a thought.

She smiled encouragingly at me. 

I continued. If I am going to take on this job, you expect me to be here full-time, right? 

She nodded slowly, her head lolling to the side. Lionel remained quiet, polishing off the steak on his plate. Bosworth, whod been lurking in the corner of the room, looked as nervous as ever. 

I took a deep breath. Well, thats not going to work. I mean, you took my phone, right? If I just stay here and skip all of my classes and not let anyone know that Im ok, then theyre going to worry and call the police. Theyll look for me, thinking Im unsafe or being hurt and if they find me here, which they will, then they 

Margery suddenly let out a loud, inhuman-sounding screech, covering both of her ears as she shook her head violently. The sudden display chased my planned speech right back down my throat and I nearly pissed my pants right then and there. 

Then suddenly, she stopped. Just like that, as though she could turn off her craziness with a switch. She smiled at me, spittle glistening on the sides of her mouth, dripping down her chin. She cocked her head to the side again. 

Youre not planning on disappointing us, are you? Her voice had returned to its normal, chirpy cadence as she singsong-ed the words, but there was a very evident threat beneath the sugar. 

I shook my head no. No, no, of course not. I want to be here. I want to be part of this family. 

That seemed to steady her mood. She straightened her head. I was learning the outlines of their insanity, learning where to tread and where to sidestep. 

All I was trying to say was that I should let at least one person know that Im safe. If I could call someone, they would make sure that no one informs the police or gets the wrong idea. 

For what must have been a full minute she said nothing, just stared at me, smiling. I never thought a smile could make me feel as sickened as I did then. 

But there was something worse than Margery Fitzwillys smile. 

Finally, finally, she answered. I suppose that makes sense, dear. Though, you must understand, weve had so many girls and boys who said they wanted to be a part of our family too. They disappointed us. They tried to get away from us, tried to get us in trouble. I like you, girl. I really, really do. I would hate for you to be just another disappointment. She flattened her veined, weathered hands on the table. But I do see your point. We shall need to trust you first. Trust must be earned. 

Then she stood, as did Lionel. They both left without another word to me. 

Bosworth escorted me to the nursery. Dylan was still asleep. I tried talking to Bosworth but he simply shut me in the nursery and bolted the door from the outside. I sank into the rocking chair beside the crib and just sat there for what felt like hours, stewing over what I could possibly do to earn their trust. 

Only once the idea began to form in my mind, did I allow myself the luxury of falling asleep. 

The next morning brought a fresh sense of determination. When I woke up, Dylan was on his knees and leaning against the bars of his crib, looking at me. I couldnt say anything to him just yet. I knew we were being watched and listened to. So I got him out and dressed him in day clothes. I could hear his hollow stomach rumbling, so I carried him downstairs. The door had been unlocked in the early hours. I had to put him in a giant high-chair and then feed him a bottle of formula. Something made me feel vaguely uneasy about the white liquid, but he drank it greedily, and I made a mental note to try and replace it with something else. 

Margery made me play with him, flying toys through the air and making all the sound effects as well. I tried moving through the house under the guise of our little games, trying to spot my phone, but of course it was never in plain sight. Dylan remained as quiet as death, but still tried to grab the toys I teased him with, acting out the role so faithfully I wondered if he had started to lose his real identity through the years. Nothing overtly strange happened until about mid-afternoon. 

I had taken a bathroom break and when I came back, Margery was waiting for me outside. She tilted her head to the side in her regular, creepy fashion, and pointed to where Dylan lay sniffling.

The baby needs changing. 

My stomach dropped. 

Oh god. 

No, they werent going to make me do this. 

Yes, they were. I was forced to change Dylans diaper.

Hed shit himself quit badly, and there was something different about his demeanour, a fracture in his previous monotony. I was more concerned about the humiliation this guy must have felt than having to clean up his shit. This was the regular pattern of events for about a week. 

I fed him, burped him, changed him, played with him, sang to him, put him to sleep. 

The initial bubble of hysterical laughter that had accompanied nearly every routine had long since vanished by the third day of this. I was getting angrier, wearier, more pissed off. I had to try and gain their trust by making them think I was being compliant but I didnt know how much more of this I could take. I still couldnt communicate with Dylan safely, for someone was always watching us. I eventually memorised the layout of the bottom floor as I was never allowed up the stairs.

But I knew the living areas and kitchen and library and nursery quite well, even discovered a crawlspace hidden in the back of the nursery, though it lay in one of the cameras line of vision.

The day eventually came when Margery allowed me my phone call, after I managed to convince her that people would definitely be starting to worry now. I had put Dylan down for his nap. It was late afternoon, early evening. I was called into the kitchen and handed my phone, the Fitzwillys and Bosworth facing me, waiting to listen to make sure I didnt say anything I shouldnt. Lionel leaned over my shoulder, watching me select the number.

Shit. I couldnt call the police.

The only person who was in my city right now, who Id known for a long time and who might believe the insanity of my situation was Zander. So I clicked on his contact. Lionel nodded. 

Zander, to my eternal shock and everlasting gratitude, actually picked up on the forth ring.

Teresa? his voice was distorted and there was a ton of noise in the background. He was obviously busy, at some event or other.

Yeah, um, hi. My voice was surprisingly even. 

I shifted my gaze to take in all of the three people around me. Lionel still waited behind me, Margery stood to my left and Bosworth to my right. The counter stood in front of me. From the sound of his voice, I was probably the last person on this planet Zander would ever imagine calling him. I could practically hear him raising his eyebrows. 

Uh, how have you been?

Im good, Ive been good, thanks. Yourself?

Im fine. Look, Teresa, not that Im being an asshole or anything, but why are you calling me?

I cant say hi to an old friend? I laughed the fakest laugh I had ever emitted in my life. 

Youre hilarious. Okay, Im gonna need you to listen to me very carefully, okay?

Teresa, whats going 

I shoved Lionel as hard as I could, careful to not end the call. I dove over the counter and felt Margery grab onto my foot. I lifted my other leg and kicked her hard in the face. She fell back with a scream and I ran like hell to the nursery. I grabbed the key from the outside lock, shut the doors and bolted it. 

Dylan was still asleep, still put out by whatever shit they put in his formula before every nap and sleep session. I put the phone to my ear, heart beating out of control. Zander was still in mid-sentence.

 iously, what the fuck is going on over there? The background noise had faded to a murmur. He must have gone somewhere quieter. His voice was angry but there was concern as well. 

I could already hear Margerys banshee-like screams, I could hear the thundering of footsteps down the hall. 

Listen, please! I begged. Im with Dylan right now and were in a trouble. You need to get the cops to come over here and now! The people were with might kill us! 

Bosworths heavy blows began shaking the door. I moved to take Dylan out of the crib and hide him, just in case theyd try to hurt him.

Zander, please, youre the only one who can help us.

What, did you just say 'Dylan'? I dont 

I SWEAR TO GOD THIS ISN'T A JOKE! PLEASE JUST GET HELP! 

I screamed out the address at him several times before my phone died. I rushed around the room looking for the cameras, then covered them. I turned off the light and began dragging Dylan to the crawlspace Id mapped out in my head. 

We had just reached it when the door came flying off its hinges. I quickly laid Dylan inside as comfortably as I could in my haste and left the door semi-open, moving a chair in front of it.

The light came on and then Bosworth was picking me up by the arms. I kicked out, as hard as I could, catching him once in the groin and he barely flinched. That was . . . not normal. He threw me to the floor and when I looked up, I looked up into the most horrific sight I had ever seen in my life. 

I thought Margery Fitzwillys smiles were unsettling. 

But they was nothing compared to the long, long frown she wore that dipped past her sagging jowls. 

Her face was bloody from the kick my boot had delivered, thick blood pouring out of her nose. Her eyes had gone dark, something vicious and evil barely restrained behind them. Lionel wasnt there.

Just Margery, in her terrifying glory. 

She leaned down until her bleeding nose nearly touched mine. 

Naughty, naughty girl. Why did you do that? 

She tilted her head to the side, several degrees further than what looked comfortable or natural. I felt a dread unlike any other I had ever experienced before begin to seep into my very soul. 

Take her. She straightened herself and Bosworth picked me up again, dragging me by the arms out of the nursery. She sang as I was carried screaming across the floors of the house and down a flight of stairs, her voice the same eerie chirrup that only fed my terror and panic.

*Ring-a-round the rosie,*

*A pocket full of posies,*

*Ashes! Ashes!*

*We all fall down . . . *

<TEXT> Margery and Lionel Fitzwilly were the two most intriguing people that lived in my neighbourhood. Well, I thought them to be intriguing. 

Everyone else just thought they were weird.

 Its not like I saw them that often beyond Margerys weekly flower tending and Lionels monthly lawn-mowing. Theirs was the only house that showed any kind of distinction from the otherwise identical block. They had a meticulously well-kept front lawn, green grass. They were pretty quiet, seemed friendly enough in a detached sort of way and always smiled at us kids whenever we played outside. 

Model neighbours. 

I particularly found this characteristic of their nature to be interesting, seeing as nearly the entire population of my small, sleepy town consisted almost solely of the nosy, prying type of older person you secretly want to shove off a bridge. But of course, because that kind of thinking tends to be frowned upon in polite society, you settle for an awkward deflection of the topic they are prying into, a fake ass smile and a clumsy retreat into your own home. Thats my hometown, a bunch of people who have no natural inclination regarding social cues. One of the many reasons I left as soon as I could, to any big city far away enough for me to forget about my time there. 

I shouldnt be badmouthing small towns. Its a clich, I suppose. But behind every tired and worn clich there exists a kernel of truth, a source of the exhaustion, and I can attest to the fact. Its another clich that small towns tend to host the hardest horrors. Another vestige of truth, another thing that I can, unfortunately, attest to. 

What I am about to tell you is real. I hail from the days of blanket forts and Saturday morning cartoons when they were still good and when privileges meant being able to play outside with my friends until the first street light turned on, then booking it back home before my mom beat my ass. To amuse ourselves, my friends and I fancied ourselves pranksters. We thought we were the shit back in the day, eight or nine years old, going through the regular motions of ding-dong-ditch and leaving dog shit on the neighbour s porches and helping the mailman reconfigure the neighbourhood mail-distribution system. Like I said before, clich small town. That was our entertainment, and at the time, we thought it was pretty funny.

 I had two best friends growing up. Zander Hayes, Dylan Parks and I went all the way back to shitting-in-a-diaper days. I may have been the token girl of the group but I could handle myself pretty well with those two dipshits and Id like to think adulthood hasnt mellowed my toughness. We lived pretty close to each other, about a block away from one another. We went to school together, we did homework together, we played together, and we got in and out of trouble together. The three musketeers, my mom used to call us. 

It was our fault, I guess. 

We started it. 

We didnt mean to we just . . . we got bored. And once you get bored, you get stupid. Reckless. Thats what we were. Our pranks were pretty innocent. Annoying and disrespectful, maybe, but harmless. Wed exhausted our little repertoire of tricks and had christened just about every neighbourhood home except the Fitzwillys. We stayed away because my parents told me to. Zander and Dylans parents werent too fussed about them. To most of the neighbourhood, the Fitzwillys were a strange couple, existing in a self-isolation that rendered them of no interest to the rest of the community. But my father always said there was something that bugged him about the two of them . . . something that seemed to elicit a warning to me and my siblings to stay the hell away. I abided by that rule, managing to keep my two friends and the other kids we hung out with away from that house. 

But one day, one day the vaguely pressing warning seemed to fade out of memory as sheer childish boredom-induced idiocy took over. So we pranked them. 

And god, Ive regretted it every day in the ten years since then. 

We were very thorough in our planning strategies. We needed a prank that would fit the profile of the victim well. So we decided to cut the heads off the flowers in Margerys rose garden. It was foolish. It was stupid. We knew just how much that woman seemed to care for her rose garden. There were so many of them, a near four dozen roses, all beautiful and well-kept, and we cut them all down in the late evening just before we were due to be home. We thought we were clever about it, too. As though the dying sun could somehow conceal our foolishness. We took advantage of the Fitzwillys recluse-like lifestyle, thinking theyd never notice us. Dylan and I did the actual snipping. We turned to leave, giggling like idiots, blissfully unaware of what wed just done. I turned to stare at our handiwork one last time as the others all mounted their bikes, and that was when I noticed that Margery was standing in the window of her home, hand drawing back the thick curtain as she stared after us. 

My blood ran cold. 

I expected her to come flying out of the house, to start screaming at us, to cry. Something. I wouldve preferred any one of those reactions; Id even begun mentally preparing the excuse-laden speech I would give my parents once she busted us. But then she did something that was so unexpected and peculiar and inapt that I suddenly felt the coldness of fear spider-walk down my spine. She smiled. 

Slowly, widely. Amusedly. 

Then she raised her hand and waved at an equally sluggish rate. I turned and sped off on my bike, wholeheartedly creeped out. Dylan disappeared the next day. 

Big deal, newspaper interviews with friends, first interesting thing to happen to small town clich, shistorm for about a month before everyone forgot clich, lackadaisical police effort, blah blah blah. 

His parents were devastated and eventually moved out of town, after two years of fruitless searching and a cold case. Zander and I were shaken. Things were never quite the same, after that. I never told either of the guys about what I saw that day, and maybe if I had, things wouldve turned out much differently. The guilt still gnaws at me sometimes. But I was young, and I was confused and I was scared. I became determined to leave that small town.  I grew increasingly introverted, choosing to spend more time in doors reading than with my friends. That was my coping mechanism. Zander dealt with the loss differently than I did. He became a dick. That was his coping mechanism. We broke all contact round about the time we started high school. 

We were like strangers whenever we passed each other. I think now, looking back, that the reason for our drifting apart was because neither one of us had really ever gotten over Dylans disappearance. We were trying so hard to bury the memory and if that meant burying everything that reminded ourselves about our lost friend, including our friendship, then so be it. The Fitzwillys had moved and passed out of the towns mind. I remember going over to their house once, after theyd left. I dont know why, drawn by the last fond memory I had with Dylan, maybe. The rose garden had been overgrown, untidy without Margerys clever fingers to tame it. Somehow, the sight saddened me. College came, and I was relieved to get away. Sometimes fate can be a sardonic bastard because Zander and I ended up at the same college. Things were unnecessarily awkward between us, though after some stilted conversation, we exchanged numbers. We both knew it was never going to progress beyond that. 

Those two happy, inseparable nine-year olds were long gone. 


When I left home I had tried to make a clean break. That meant not relying on mommy and daddy to pay my way through school. I took out a crushing student loan that required me to find a job. I had very little experience with most forms of labour, I suppose, but I did have several younger siblings and cousins. So I advertised my services as a nanny on the internet. I received one interested phone call and before I knew it, I was the Shepards new part-time nanny. 

 I didnt think about it as critically as I should have. The pay was great. They said they were an older couple with a young child that was the definition of docile and that I could even housesit for them when I was on break, which was a huge perk because they lived in a mansion. I arrived for work the first weekend with greedy pockets and an unassuming smile. The taxi dropped me off and I trekked the long pebbled walkway to the ornate door. 


They answered on the first ring. The woman answered first. 

The moment I saw her, my stomach clenched. It couldnt be. But it was. 

It was Mrs. Fitzwilly. 

Same, strangely eerie smile, same greying hair that was beginning to thin at the top, same frail body and spindly fingers. She raised them in a gesture reminiscent of another memory from a decade before. 

Hello, dear! Her voice was chirpy, bright. 

I swallowed. This made no sense. 

Uh . . . Mrs. Fitzwilly? 

Her smile widened, stretching from ear to ear. It looked so painful I actually flinched.

 Oh, my lovely, no, I am Gerda Shepard. This is my husband, Arnold. She turned, arm extending to a familiar-looking elderly gentleman a few feet behind her. He wasnt smiling. It looked as though he were looking through me, grinding his jaw. 

I bit my lip. Sorry, this was a mistake  

No, no, my dear. Please, come in! Well need your services immediately, and we can even pay you in cash, if that is your concern. 

I was about to tell her **FUCK THAT** and run back down the walkway when something heavy hit me on the back of the head and the world went black. 

When I came to, I was seated on an expensive-looking couch. That was the first thing I noticed, the first sensation that returned to me. The feeling of the material. I opened my eyes, groaning at the dull throb pulsing through my skull. My eyes focused on the elderly couple seated in front of me on an opposite-facing matching couch. Margery still wore that shit-eating grin, constantly smoothing down the creases in her long, floral dress. Her husband sat beside her, still grinding his jaw, still staring at me with that odd, vacant expression of his. 

Now, ladies and gentlemen, now I must confess that I was about to leap across the tiny coffee table separating me from them and beat the hell out of Mr. and Mrs Fitzwilly, then try to get out somehow. Im not ashamed to admit that I was not above hitting old people. Not in this situation. But I knew that there must have been a third person, the one whod knocked me on the back of the head, so I kept still, tried to passively analyse my surroundings, subtly checked for my phone in my pocket. Of course it was gone. I resisted the urge to scream.

 The entire room was decked out in the style of a Victorian house. All of the furniture was ancient, bearing glimpses of their former grandeur, a large chandelier bedecking the high ceiling. There was a large bookshelf against one of the walls, lined end to end with books that probably weighed as much as a small person, and a shelf with expensive-looking porcelain dolls sitting portentously and staring with disdain at everything. 

For a few moments, no one spoke. Then Margery raised her voice, and the sudden high-pitched chirrup had my skin crawling. 

Tea! We need tea! Bosworth!

 A third figure limped into the living room, carrying a tray with three cups of tea in elegant china. I swallowed hard. That must have been the person who hit me. Bosworth was a huge, hulking mountain of a man whose severe-looking face was crossed with scars. Despite the muscles and the harshness of his features, there was something so vulnerable in his eyes. He looked like a little kid trapped in the body of a very grown man. This was further emphasised when he skittered about like a nervous puppy after dropping one of the china cups. Margery tittered on about how it didnt matter, in that pseudo-saccharine voice of hers while Lionel kept on staring at me, but from the look of pure terror etched across Bosworths face, youd have sworn he had just been sentenced to death. 

No mind, no matter, Bosworth. Just bring your baby brother, will you? 

I couldve sworn the man looked as if he were about to be hung by the balls, but he merely nodded vigorously, once, twice, then shot off to wherever his *baby brother* was. I had kept my calm so far, internalising my hysteria fairly well. 

When Margery gestured to me to take a sip of tea, I shook my head. 

I want to leave now. I said simply. 

At that, the old woman laughed a delicate cackle that was not unlike broken glass. 

But, my dear, you have agreed to look after our child. You cannot simply walk out now. Not until youre part of the family.


Listen, lady, I have a family and friends and they know where I am and theyre going to find me here eventually, so you better let me outta here. I lifted a hand to my aching head and it came away bloody. I eyed the butterknife lying on the table, pleasantly chilling next to a loaf of bread and pots of jam and butter. I didnt want to kill or even hurt anyone. But I would do whatever I had to to get out of here. They seemed crazy, but I was sure a threat with a knife might sober up any madness. 


Margery just continued to smile at me, though it crinkled a little.

 Just meet our little Jaime. You might yet just change your mind. He is so . . . precious. I turned at the sound of Bosworth returning, steeling myself to face whatever little devil a woman this demented would dub precious.

 When I saw him, my heart seemed to stop beating.

 Dark brown hair, soft brown eyes . . . Dylan Parks.

 I couldnt string together a single coherent thought. It was Dylan, and while the last ten years had lengthened his frame and added a ghost of stubble, I would recognise his face anywhere. He was dressed in little boy clothes, his body so gaunt that they barely stuck tight around his body, he had a pacifier in his mouth and an adult diaper peeking through his tiny shorts. 

He seemed to recognise me too, because even though he remained silent  I saw his eyes flash for an instant, then cloud with tears. 

For several long moments that seemed to stretch into an eternity, I remained silent, looking at him look at me and a quiet understanding seemed to be forged between the two of us. I had no idea what was going on, I had no idea who these people were or what the fuck theyd been doing to him, but I did know one thing. I was not going to leave my friend here. 

I was going to get him out. 

Well, I told you he is just darling! Margery stood up, twirled in a circle, and then sat back down. What do you say? Do you take the job? 

I looked at Dylan one more time before turning to face the couple. I schooled my features into neutrality and with a voice that was clear of any of the horror I felt roiling inside of me, I said the words. Somehow, I said the words. 

I accept.

<TITLE> What Would You Do For Family? </TITLE>

<TEXT> What would you do for family? For those who share your blood? 

Its true that we cant pick and choose our family, but if we could, the only relative I would keep would be Cole. Cole was my twin brother. 

Being an identical twin is something that is very difficult to describe. I dont know what its like to live in a world where someone doesnt share my face. Its being a half and a whole at the same time. 

Kind of like being part of an inside joke that you share with only one other person on this planet.

 Like living twice. 

Cole was my better half, I always tell people. Despite being only eight minutes and three seconds older than me, he always acted like my big brother. He protected me from bullies growing up, he threatened any guy who so much as winked at me. Maybe he could go overboard at times, trying to keep me safe, but his heart was always in the right place. Sometimes all we had was each other. 

Our father existed in two states: the drunken verbal abuser, and asleep. Our mother was cold, distant. She was a woman born with the icy heart of the imperial, but the circumstances of the middleclass and she hated us for it. Her only concerns were what the community thought of us, clawing onto any faade of bourgeois that she could peoples thoughts on our occasional bruises and sad faces were more of a concern than the physical or even internal damage we suffered. She never intervened when our dad shoved us around, shouted at us about how inadequate we were, how embarrassing we were, what disappointments we were. 

Cole always got it worse, though.

 I cant tell you how many times he stepped between our father and me and took whatever punishment was meant for me upon himself. He never once complained about it, never once blamed me. 

We have to stick together, Lane. Was all hed tell me afterwards, when Id weep in our room after the latest tirade. We were eleven the day our father finally hit one of us. It was me. I had spoken back to him and received a hell of a backhand that sent me careening into the nearest shelf and bloody my nose and mouth. Cole jumped in immediately and hit him back, so hard that he staggered several feet. Then our fathers eyes clouded over with a rage that burned through the drunken stupor and made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. He charged at Cole with a fist that seemed made of iron and made Cole seem as though he were made of glass and I had to help Cole get out bed for the next week until he could finally see out of both eyes again. 

After that day it was like . . .some barrier that stopped our father from physically hitting us had been breached and there was no going back. It became a regular occurrence until one day, Cole hit him back. 

With a knife. 

In the throat. 

Of course it was a big shitstorm. No one believed that it was self-defence because our mother had done a pretty good fucking job of maintaining the illusion that we were a perfect family with no secrets and no problems. She was terrified that this little incident would fracture the veneer shed worked so hard to sculpt, and so she did the worst thing she could ever have done: she had Cole declared criminally insane and sent him to Angel Peaks Psychiatric Hospital. Apparently, having a son who was mentally disturbed was better than having one who was in prison. Being thirteen, there wasnt much we could do about it. It was the worst day of my life, watching them come for Cole. I stayed up with him the night before he was due to be collected. It was the first time Id seen my big brother cry. He made me promise to write to him, to not forget about him.

 I swore I wouldnt. 

I would visit. 

I would write. 

I would remember. 

More importantly, I wouldnt forget, ever.

 I promised. 

Several years passed and my mother refused to let me send letters to Angel Peaks, to even let me visit my brother. She wouldnt divulge the address so I couldnt visit. I still wrote them, 364 letters, one for every week until our twentieth year. I kept him updated on everything. I told him about how our maths teacher was sacked for faking his degree, about how our elderly neighbour Mrs. Parks finally got taken in for growing marijuana in her backyard, about how I had met a guy I really liked, and could even begin to love. 

Sam was always so supportive about me finding my brother. He never laughed when he caught me writing the letters which might never be sent. He tried his damnest to help me locate the place, but it was like it never existed no one had heard of it, it wasnt registered anywhere it was just . . . memory and rumour.

 I could kick myself for not trying harder. 

 I never received a letter from Cole. I worried that my mother might be destroying them before I could read them. She tried to erase my brothers existence from memory itself but I never forgot him. I couldnt. Not anymore than I could forget the searing incompleteness of a missing limb. Part of me was missing. In time, though, I began to heal and move on. I made more friends, got a job to earn money and started getting serious with Sam. We began dating when we were fifteen, and when we turned twenty, I finally decided to move out of the house and in with him.

 The day I moved out I confronted my mother about everything. It came pouring out of me, my hatred for how she allowed her children to be verbally and physically abused for years, for her coldness and cruelty, for sending my brother away when all he did was try to protect us. She took it all with a vacant, blank stare. I continued to yell at her, despite her stillness. Years of pent-up aggression and hurt had finally been allowed a release and I took it. I demanded she tell me where Angel Peaks was but she wouldnt speak. She just sat there, like a statue. Eventually, I scoured the attic myself until I found it, boxed up with Coles things the business card belonging to Spence Fraser, head doctor of Angel Peaks Psychiatric Hospital. I thundered out of the house without so much as another glance at my mother. I even slammed the door hard enough to shatter a window.

 It felt really good. 

When I got to Sams apartment that night, I began the doleful, wretched practise of putting pen to paper to mark the 365th letter. What began as a standard, almost formal piece of writing soon devolved into a piteous apology, my emotions working their way into every letter and punctuation mark, every space until my eyes began to sting and the ink and white began to blur. That painful hollowness that Id suffered since that awful day seven years ago began to ache and I had to force myself to carry on writing. I told him everything, apologised for not writing sooner, explained how our mother had deliberately prevented me from staying in contact with him but that I never forgot, no, I didnt, I always, always remembered. 

I got my first response a couple of days later. Sam thought something was wrong because I screamed out loud when I saw the address. He came bolting in from the bedroom. 

Laney? What the fuck is going on? Are you okay? Whats the 

He replied. Id said with tears in my eyes, looking up from the envelope I held with shaking hands.

 Sams broad shoulders slumped slightly as he let out a breath. He ran a hand through his messy hair. Thats . . . thats good, right? Its what you wanted?

 I nodded my head, unable to speak. He came to sit next to me. 

Open it when youre ready.

 I was ready. I practically tore the envelope to shreds to get to the letter. I waited for that sweet, eluding feeling of the familiar to hit me as my eyes scanned the letter. I wanted to recognise my brothers handwriting, wanted to immediately identify the voice of his writing, in the way that one can always recognise the markings of loved ones. But nothing. I couldnt remember his handwriting, couldnt place the tone of his letter. It bothered me for a split second, but I shoved it away and continued reading anyway.

*Hey sis*


*Long time no see, huh? Long time no chat. Long, long, long time. Ive missed you. Very much. Life here is dull and boring and I often think about how life wouldve been had I not been sent here. What would I be doing right now? What would my life have become, were it not for these walls and fences and angels? I dont know.*

*Ive had years to think and clarify my mind, Laney. Years that served me well to redefine who I am. But I need my sister to help me piece things back together.*

 *I need you.*

 *Please, if its not too much to ask, please come and see me? I would very much like it if you visited me. What would you do for family?*


*Much love,*


*Your Loving Brother*

I held the letter to my chest, still crying. Beside me, Sam scratched his head. 

Laney, was your brother always this, um . . . He scrambled for the right word. Sam was the kind of guy who thought very carefully about everything he said. He never just blurted things out. 

I shot him a glare. This what, Sam?

 He swallowed and shrugged his shoulders. This . . . I dont mean to offend you or him, you know that, but this . . . strange-sounding. I guess. 


Well how about you spend a near-decade in an asylum for the sole reason of preserving your fucked-up familys reputation, then get back to me so I can see how normal you sound.

 He bristled. Look, babe, Im not trying to be a dick about it, Im just saying that 


I didnt think I would ever get a chance to see him again. I didnt think he would ever want to see me again. This is . . . more than I could ever have hoped for and I just want to enjoy it, please, just let me have this. You have no idea the hell weve been through together. 

Sam was quiet for a long time, then, finally, he put a hand on my shoulder. Alright. Okay. Just, be careful, will you? 

Cole and I corresponded for several weeks before I finally decided to go and see him and he was very excited. Sam offered to take me, but I wanted, needed to do this on my own. I told him that maybe one of these days, he could come and visit Cole so the two could get a chance to meet. I decided to take my own car. I had taken all of the letters and the business card so I have the directions on hand. It took about three hours to get there from our little place in the city.

 My apprehension began to skyrocket the moment I crossed from city terrain to woodlands. 

The number of cars on the road began to drop until it was just me, driving along a long, winding road uphill with thick foliage on either side and mist beginning to creep along the way. I kept on checking the business card to make sure I had the right address. The place seemed extremely isolated. I still had my phone on me, so I wasnt too worried. Finally, I reached the gates of the institution. The mist had congealed, wrapping around the foundation of the building like thick, ghastly tendrils. 


It was late afternoon, but the sun was eclipsed by heavy clouds. The gates were derelict, run-down, the definition of unkempt. And the statues . . . there were about five statues resting on the property large, marble figures with giant wings, weeping in stony eternal silence, freezing the blood in my veins. The gate was open. I walked in and followed the path until I reached the building. 

The door was also unlocked.

 I entered cautiously, suddenly terrified. The foyer was empty; the box where a secretary would ordinarily sit and conduct the administration looked pitifully vacant. There was a vague unpleasant smell permeating the air, something that made my insides recoil. The place obviously hadnt been cleaned in eons but why the fuck was it empty?

 Id never been to a mental institution before so I had no idea about how things were meant to be but I was sure thered have to be people milling about, doctors and assistants and . . . and . . .

. . . something was so very, very wrong. 

For some or other reason, I didnt whip out my phone and call my boyfriend. Or the police. I continued down the dark corridor, slowly as I could, trepidation dictating every halting step. The hallways were filled with the kind of silent darkness that seeps into your soul and makes you want to squirm out of your skin. I prayed for any kind of noise, any voice because in the few minutes Id spent in that abandoned asylum, I felt the most alone I ever had in my entire life. You dont realise how comforting a human presence can be until youre deprived of it.

  I could hear soft music come from the mess hall. Hope began to bloom within some stupid, stupid part of me and I followed the magical sounds as though the notes could pull me with invisible strings. The tune was catchy, a gentle lilt that, on a day not marred by nightmares, might have me taping my foot or humming along to the cheery guitar and colourful piano and rhythmic bongo drums reminiscent of happier memories, smiling times.


*Sweet, sweet, darling wont you be mine*


*Youre a-breakin my heart, little baby*


*Oh wont you be mine*


*The things I could show you*


 I walked toward the room and stopped just outside of the threshold. I took a deep breath, my nose turning up because the smell was stronger here. 


*I swear to you my honey*


*This is the start of something a-new*


*Wont you be mine b-b-baby*


*Sweet, sweet darling wont you be mine*


I opened the door. The lighting was poorer in here the overhead lamps had begun to flicker, casting the room in greys of alternating brightness. There was a table in the centre of the room, laden with pots and pans and plates and cutlery and chunks of meat and rotten fruit. The room itself was barren-looking, stark white except for the splashes of crimson decorating the tiles and walls, as though someone had tried to liven up the dcor a little bit. 

Blood. 

Blood on the walls, on the tiles, on the table.

 And in the chairs each supported a lifeless body, a patient or doctor, faces engraved in an eternal grimace that looked half pained and half shocked. A terrifying expression. Flies had begun to feast on their flesh. 

I fell to my knees and vomited. 


*Oh, honey*


*Wont you set me free*


*Oh little darlin Im begging please*


*Be mine, mine, mine*



There was movement in one of the dark corners untouched by the meagre light. A voice was singing along to the tune, fingers snapped in appreciation of the melody. After I puked up my guts, I wiped my mouth, shaking. Then I saw him, or at the very least, an outline of him, a darker shadow against shadow. He slowly began to move away from the corner, still singing along, still snapping his fingers.


*Oooh when you look at me with those pretty, pretty eyes*


*Honey I cant breathe yeah you got me hypnotized*


*With those playful hips and those devilish lips*


*Ooh baby come a little closer*

He stepped into the light. The scream Id been keeping inside came out as a whimper. 

His face. 

He was small, even smaller than I am, and seemed to be permanently hunched over, his gait halted. He looked painfully skinny, bones protruding through thin flesh that seemed washed of any colour, pale as one of the corpses seated around the table. He kept on tilting his head from side to side, dipping his chin ever so slightly, as though his neck couldnt support the weight of his head. His eyes seemed bulbous in comparison to his emaciated shell of a body, his gaze intense and glazed with insanity. And his smile. His teeth were bloody. I didnt want to know whose blood was in his mouth. His grin was almost inhumanly wide, barely moving as he continued singing that damned song. 


*Come with me my honey*


*Ill take you far away*


*Baby cant ya see that when youre with me*


*You wont ever have to change nuh-no*


Tears sprang from my eyes. Where . . .where was Cole? I couldnt see him anywhere. He definitely was not the monster standing in front of me. He wasnt . . . one of the corpses around the table. Where the fuck was my brother?! 


*Almost free baby baby*


*Almost free*


*Youll be free when youre with me*


*Be mine*


The music ended abruptly. We stood there, staring at each other, him still bearing that demonic-looking grin. What was he? There was no way . . .no way he could be a human being. Right? Surely, surely this was not possible. He took a step toward me and I stumbled back, still on my hands and knees. His smile tilted downwards a fraction. 

Laney, what kind of greeting is that for your brother?


You are not my brother! I shouted, surprised at the force in my voice despite the tears rolling down my cheeks. He cocked his head to the side in a sharp, feral movement.

 I am, Laney, I am. Weve been talking for weeks now. This is who Id been talking to? I was vaguely aware of the heaving of my chest as I began to sob violently. 

No, no, no, no , no, no, no, no, no, no . . . 

His smile perked up again. 

Ah, you mean other brother. Come with me. 

He performed his stilted walk out of the door behind him, still humming that tune. I didnt know what else to do. Everything was so surreal it was like witnessing the very glass of your reality begin to fracture, then shatter before your eyes. Real? Nightmare? So confused, so, so confused. I eventually followed him down the corridor, keeping a safe distance, or as relatively safe a distance as I could in this situation. He led me to another room and cheerfully opened the door. 

Quiet. Other brother is sleeping. He giggled conspiratorially. I walked in and stopped short. I fell to my knees for the second time that day, taking in the tag dubbing the wearer as Cole Dreyton. It was Cole, familiar dark hair wild and tousled, familiar green eyes staring out at me, familiar mouth set in a grim line. My features. My twin. My brother, hanging from the roof of his cell with a rope tied around his neck, skin taking on the pallor of the newly deceased.

 I found 364 letters stuffed in his pillow, all addressed to me, unsent, never going to be sent. Each ending with that same line about how *we have to stick together, Lane*. I couldnt feel anything, I wish I did. I would give anything to feel, to feel the sting of heartache, the bite of anger, the shunt of rage. 

But all I could summon was an aching, quiet numbness. 

The worst pain is the kind you cant feel. 

Dead. 

Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

 Dead. 

Dead. 

I must have sat in that cell for hours. Eventually, that strange little creature pulled me out and led me back to the table where he said hed prepared tea, just for me. I sat there, not really taking anything in, not registering anything beyond the coldness of my seat and the smell of stale blood and the same song being played  on repeat over and over again.

 And again. 

***

Its been a few days. The battery on my phone is about to die. Ive been ignoring everyones messages and phone calls. 

I just wanted to post this. 

I dont know what to call this person so he just made me call him Brother. Things dont really make sense anymore: the stale, dead air is just air to me, the decomposing bodies have formed part of the furniture and that song, well, its growing on me. 


Brother tells me we have to stick together. We have to and although I hated him at first, Im starting to come around, I think. Im getting better. I dont know how he managed to take control of the entire asylum. 

Hes very persuasive. 

I cried when I realised Id forgotten about him because I promised. I promised to always remember, but more importantly, to never forget. Brother forgives me though, says it wasnt my fault. 

I was sick. But Im getting better. Im finally starting to look like him, too, so its nice.

 Im not used to not having someone in the world share my face.

 I missed having a twin, but now I feel more complete, I guess. Half of a whole. 

Like being dead twice. 

Brother says he is getting lonely again, although he assures me he loves having me around. 

Thats why Im posting. 

We miss you. 

You probably forgot about us, but we have never forgotten about you. Come and visit us, wont you? We can have tea, catch up, remind you about us, about your family.  Silly, naughty you for forgetting! Haha!


*Sweet, sweet, darling wont you be mine*


*Youre a-breakin my heart, little baby*


*Oh wont you be mine*


*The things I could show you*


Sorry, I love that song. Anyhoo, my phone is about to die but were waiting. Waiting for you, like he waited for me. Missing you. Its been a long time. Long, long, long time. Life is getting dull. We need some excitement again. 


*Almost free baby baby*


*Almost free*


*Youll be free when youre with me*


*Be mine*


We cant wait to see you. Its been such a long time. I know visiting can be a chore but . . . what would you do for family?

Much love,

Your loving Brother and Sister </TEXT>

And unless they've faced this kind of evil themselves they'll never truly get just how frightening it is. I wish I could tell Alex that at least one person got it.
