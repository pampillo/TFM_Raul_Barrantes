<TEXT> Many libraries are actually trying to phase out late fees. Where I work we have constantly talked about decreasing the fines on books since the overall "profit" of late fees on materials means close to nothing. What we've done is introduce erroneously named initiatives like a "rewards club," where checking out 100 items removes the possibility of late fees on your account for the rest of the year. We have movies and tv shows to check out as well, so people will just come in and take 10 movies every few days and soon not have to worry about late fees again. We encourage it because we want circulation stats and the patrons love it because they don't want to pay fines. Go find a suggestions box or forum for your library and bring the idea up. They might take you up on the idea if enough support and interest is shown. </TEXT>

I just read The Little Book of Hygge, which goes deep into the Danish obsession for warm candle lighting, cozy places, and blankets, and how that has helped them become the planet's veritable titans of happiness. So I've already been envisioning the scene you have conjured up, my man. Thanks for the instrumental suggestions, that's a field I have a pressing need for exposure to! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Beginning The Brothers Karamazov, anyone have any advice for me? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 01:59:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I decided to finally start the book I've had on my reading list since I was a sophomore in high school. My history teacher gave a soapbox speech about it to us, concluding that if we wanted to know ourselves we should read The Brothers Karamazov. Years went by and I ended up taking 3 years of Russian language and culture classes in college, but never found the time for Dostoevsky. More years went by and now that I'm done with my masters, pulled out the paperback copy I bought close to 10 years ago and am ready to begin. As added incentive, my girlfriend has agreed to begin her own treacherous, long put-off book, House of Leaves, if I get through this. I'm a librarian now, so a man's gotta do what he's gotta do to get his fellow dudes to read.

I thought I'd submit a thread asking my book friends for any tips, strategies, or general advice they might have for me before I get started. I've been exposed to Russian lit and its language before, so I totally understand that nickname conventions and the huge cast of characters are hard to grasp at first, but I think I'll be okay in that regard. I suppose what I'm asking is also more for you to share your thoughts and supply some insights, or point to accompanying material/literature that can enhance the read for me. Really anything to motivate me even more to embark on this journey is appreciated. I want book hype, I want sources that provide literary context, I want someone to say, "Hey, take it from me, you should draft up a character web to help you navigate through the story," or, "Eat some borscht and embrace your inner east Slavic."

What it comes down to is I'm excited and want everyone else to be excited. Not for me, but because there are great books out there, prolific books that can mean so much to someone despite having never read the work before. Books that carry so much clout with them that just opening up the cover can fills us with an unparalleled giddy anticipation for the journey about to unfold. I'm raving, perhaps emotionally off-kilter. Whatever. I hope everyone can enjoy a nice book tonight, and thanks in advance for anything you end up sharing.

<TEXT> Ooohh, that'd be cool to get Bulgarians to spawn. Although how do you mean free clay? In that if their demands are met, they'll become an independent nation, thus probably allowing me to declare war on them immediately before they can gather allies? I'm a little foggy on how support rebels work, and how that translates to "free clay".

I'm guaranteeing Candar at the moment, as I went a little crazy in Poland and up through Crimea. I have Caffa and the two provinces neighboring either side of it, and those are definitely in fabrication distance for when the time comes. 

Iberia is unfortunately all under Castile's solid rule. I've seen Naples break away so many times this patch, too. Of course they don't when I finally manage to get a footing now.

<TEXT> Just looking for advice. Was hoping to go for Basileus and don't feel like restarting 100 more times if this one goes south. So how do I succeed from here?

I've got a truce timer with the Ottomans until '91 because I accidentally took a ton of land off Venice without realizing it and started a massive coalition war. That was bad. Poland obviously chose to go with a local lord and is fighting Lithuania now. Austria got the inheritance. Everything else looks pretty normal for an early game besides my PU with Serbia and Wallachian Vassal. My plan is to go in through Italy with a claim on the Papal State, but I'd like to finish off the Ottomans first, I think. What should my plan of attack be from here? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, I'm with you on the Azael thing. I don't want to just sit here and bash the guy on personal preference, as I do genuinely think he's a good analyst in post game talks and such. But in game his casting always seems like he's casting to prove something. He's very negative on player performances and quick to call out how bad of a decision something is, but in my opinion color casting should be more about breaking down the gameplay, setting up why the play occurred, and then speaking about the ramifications of it. 

Azael seems far too reactive in game, mimicking play-by-play casters too much, trying to follow the action and show off his knowledge at the same time. This restricts the depth of his analysis and what comes out is just really rudimentary observations like "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! WITH THAT ACE THEY CAN JUST GO MID AND END THE GAME" or "WHAT A TURN AROUND! THIS MEANS THEY CAN GO STRAIGHT TO BARON!" And then he'll follow-up with comments that say something like "See, that was really good for them because it was good for them." I think he gets caught up in the moment, and that ends up sacrificing a lot of insight. He has that full-of-himself vibe going on, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I just don't think he's proven that he deserves that tone, based on the knowledge he's so rarely expressed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure what you mean. I never said it would, but the main conceit of the book is that Kvothe is retelling his story over the course of three days to the scribe. Rothfuss is using Kvothe to stretch this whole unreliable narrator thing to its bounds. At this point, if he doesn't end with Kvothe, or provide some conclusion for him, what was the point of the 1500+ pages of the first two books relating entirely to Kvothe?

Don't get me wrong, I like the books, and think Rothfuss is a fantastic story-teller. But they were some of the most frustrating reads I've ever committed to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In regard to The Name of the Wind, it has never felt "worth it" to me. The structure of the plot is scattered and all over the place, and it's really just Rothfuss telling one tale after another of Kvothe's crazy, wacky adventures. There's this pretension of an underlying plot, and there's a lot that he does well--better than any fantasy writer out there today--but for how long book one and book two are, I expected much more progress to be made in the narrative. Instead, Rothfuss meanders for 1500 pages. I have no idea how he expects to wrap this up as a trilogy, and I don't want to set myself up for a pessimistic viewpoint, but I can't see it ending in a satisfying way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanted to do the same thing, but instead I subscribed to Goodreads and set a year goal of 32ish books. This creates a tangible checkoff list for me that helps. I have a real hard time both motivating myself to read, and then remaining focused on it when I do open up the cover. I go through spurts of reading now, reading one book while listening to another on my drive to work one week, then nothing for the next. My unspoken goal is to get 3-4 books completed a month, which is like 1 book a week, but more forgiving. Some weeks I'm not in a good mental state, so setting monthly or yearly goals makes me feel better about what could be a hard to maintain rigid weekly schedule.

<TEXT> I suppose you're right about the Czech Republic, it would just be a change of government, really. It's wishful thinking, haha.

Though, I'm not sure I agree that just because something is ahistorical, it shouldn't be in the game. Scandinavia exists, for example. Westphalia and Hanover are formable nations, too. While Czechoslovakia never lasted as a country, it's still as much a goal to aspire to such as the like of Sweden becoming Scandinavia, or Hesse forming Westphalia. What's really the point of tag-switching to these nations other than something else to do with your nation?

But I do like the idea of Austria-Hungary. Really, anything that could give the Czechs something else to do after the Hussite narrative goes away.  </TEXT>

It ended up being too late to remove the Ottomans, so I just nibbled off Spain, London, Tunis, and Italy for the remaining years.

<TEXT> An entertaining, playful modern retelling of the gothic picaresque/fairy tale that I read last year was Patrick DeWitt's "Undermajordomo Minor." Thomas Pynchon's books often have a lot of characters with qualities resembling those in picaresque novels, employing peculiar names and idiosyncrasies, but he's a difficult author sometimes, and you have to work for an understanding of his stuff. His "Crying of Lot 49," is a nice short introduction to his style, and "Inherent Vice" is a comical riff on detective novels that was recently made into a movie. Not a novel, but whenever I hear the word Picaresque, the Decemberists album of the same name comes to mind, and is amazing. Lyrical picaresque characters and antiquated plotlines woven into song.  </TEXT>

Due to adequate demand, I've returned with part two of my long-winded period drama, "Bohemia AAR". This one is a doozy, 36 images in length. My thoughts were to create an album for each ruler as I played them, but I'm not sure if that'll be able to be kept up. Mr. Jiri z Podebrad lasted for quite a while, but his successors might not. People might not like to read too many image descriptions either, so should I continue with this recreational project, I'll do my best with the pacing.

For the time being, I hope you enjoy reading my chronicle of the early history of Bohemia. I had a lot of fun creating the narrative for Jiri, so hopefully that comes across in the writing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could be right, it's been awhile since I took classes on the subject. From what I recall, Chiang spent a lot of his time hunting down the Red Army sympathizers (exhibit A: The Long March), It was the Red Army guerrilla warfare tactics against the Japanese and resource sharing with small, devastated villages of peasants near the Northern Manchuria occupied regions that garnered them a lot of support. Obviously, they couldn't fight effectively either with the Nationalist Army of China hunting them down. 

I don't mean to romanticize the Red Army, nor discredit the Nationalist army fully. I think Chiang didn't get criticized enough, especially by Americans due to us "siding" with him throughout the war. While he was in a precarious position, I think he was far too obsessed with wiping out the Red Army. This is all my own personal belief, though, and I can understand sentiment either way. It's just what I learned about the whole situation developed a certain bias against him and his tactics during the war. Thanks for bringing up the other side of the argument! </TEXT>

It's important to recognize state of the nation of China was in disarray, that while Chiang technically ruled the country, he proved completely inept at fighting the Japanese invasion. Instead, he spent much of his resources eliminating the Red Army. 

Sorry I don't have any numbers for the Japanese invading army, but I figured that if the core of your question was why the Chinese didn't fight back, that is better answered by examining what was going on internally in China at this time. A lot of great history books have been written about this topic if you're looking to research, one that comes to mind is Edgar Snow's account of the Red Army in the Red Star Over China, which concerns itself with the political situation in China before the Japanese invasion. 

*edit: The film City of Life and Death by Lu Chuan was a great visualization of the Massacre itself, too. Touches on the disarmed soldiers, women, children, and International Ambassadors within the city during the occupation, and what they went through.

<TEXT> The Stormlight Archives are the only Sanderson books I've read, and I've greatly enjoyed them. While there are only two publishing, the third is set to come out later this year I believe. The characters are really well written, and the pacing of his world building was really satisfying. I say this latter point because I'm incredibly frustrated with Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicles, as I feel like for a large portion of the books, so many facets of society are left unexplored. Sanderson introduces such a diverse array of characters and different perspectives that everything about his world comes together seamlessly in an engrossing way. 

I don't think you need to read any other of Sanderson's books first, like others have suggested, unless you want to appreciate the apparent shift in his writing skills. Some characters, however, have connections to his great literary universe, so perhaps reading other books will tune you into those cross-overs. All in all, though, a fantastic stand-alone series.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Edit, part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/63z3gr/couldnt_sleep_so_i_spent_3_hours_writing_a/

Due to adequate demand, I've returned with part two of my long-winded period drama, "Bohemia AAR". This one is a doozy, 36 images in length. My thoughts were to create an album for each ruler as I played them, but I'm not sure if that'll be able to be kept up. Mr. Jiri z Podebrad lasted for quite a while, but his successors might not. People might not like to read to many image descriptions, either, so should I continue with this recreational project, I'll do my best with the pacing. 

For the time being, I hope you enjoy reading my chronicle of the early history of Bohemia. I had a lot of fun creating the narrative for Jiri, so hopefully that comes across in the writing.

<TEXT> So I found myself unable to sleep tonight, so I gathered some pictures from my recent Bohemia game (trying out the new free patch features), and attempted to actually role play a little bit. I put a little bit a time into it, reading up on wikipedia to throw in some historical grounding, and generally devising a sub-par storyline to go along with the events of my playthrough. I kind of wanted to take it slow with this run, and focus on goals from ruler to ruler. Figured if I ended up chronicling it, at least that'd be a good way to catalog each part. 

This being said, you might intuit that the first part here is fairly short since Bohemia begins in interregnum and then Jiri z Podebrad  pops up and overthrows your first king. Or at least, that's how I always play them because I feel strongly about that kind of thing (Habsburgs be damned). 

Anyway, thanks for reading whoever does. I'm just a simple man who likes to look at maps, so I apologize for any mistakes I made. It's also 3am. Goodnight, reddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This might not be as strange as it is something I just don't understand. I was playing Austria and annexed a Romagna and Ancona from the Papal State. This generated some Urbino Separatist rebels. I didn't secure military access over to stop them from rising up, so they occupied both provinces and then crossed the sea and took Istria from me, too. I decided to just accept their demands, which were "All provinces owned becomes Urbino," or something like that. When I accepted, the separatists seemingly become my troops, and the occupied statuses all disappeared. I figure maybe it had something to do with Urbino still having been a vassal under the Papal State, but I have no clue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did my Luck of the Irish run with Thomond, and found it slightly easier than Desmond. While morale and manpower theoretically can help against someone like England, but early on it won't make much difference. You need good allies and numbers to push back England. Thomond's money making ideas gives you the funds to actually create the army that Desmond dreams of early on--when you'll need it. If you have late game ambitions, certainly Desmond will have the edge, so I can see the allure. You can argue that they have objectively the better ideas, as they align more with how most people play this game (expand and expand and be the best army you can be). However, you can also argue that Thomond has ideas better suited for more comfortable gameplay, emphasizing a stronger economy and colonizing. I'd say choose which style you want to play, then choose accordingly.

<TEXT> Yeah, I guess that has to be it. I guess it's just the combination of Austria having weak heirs/negative prestige all early game long while Hesse (a two province nation in the middle of a volatile HRE) survived aggression and still maintained enough clout for 100 years to dominate the votes every election. Brandenburg and Bohemia were doing quite well this run, and usually I see them vote for themselves at some point. The amount of Protestant electors that continued voting for Hesse after 1500 (Again, Brandenburg and Bohemia converted, yet still overwhelmingly voted Hesse). 

I just found it peculiar how Hesse continually defied the odds, and maintained such a strong hold on the throne. Thanks for the enlightenment, I didn't know about the IA stored influence thing! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hah, I suppose it's just a passive kind of game. Honestly, if Austria doesn't inherit the Lowlands, I rarely see them expanding much into the HRE on their own. More often I see Brandenburg or Bohemia get strong on the east side, Cologne or Munster or some random, unstable duchy that had no right being big miraculously accumulate a chunk of land in the west, and Austria in the south. Usually the religious war sparks some excitement in relationships throughout, but I guess you didn't get lucky there. 

The one time I played through Poland to the end I did feel a little bit unstoppable. Once Russia is out of the picture, and if the Ottomans stagnate, you can just go wherever you want making the right alliances. Maybe try colonizing Canada and begin a colonial war to spice things up! </TEXT>

Otherwise you could be doing well enough on your own, Poland can get pretty strong. 

I'm not sure what your plan on playing is, but games can be fairly boring if you're not pushing AE to its bounds, backstabbing allies, and remain complacent in your position. Not saying any of this is what you're doing, it's just I'm not really sure what the state of your game really is, or what you expect it should be.

<TEXT> While it is my hope that no one puts stock in the aggregated rating of a book on Goodreads, I know that people still do. So many of my favorite books are under 3.5 stars, because people use the rating system on their for personal use. Just recently, one of my friends rated Lincoln in the Bardo 2 stars because she was bothered by David Sedaris' voice in the audiobook. I get vehemently upset when people do this--and maybe I shouldn't--but I feel like if you're going to rate a book, you have to do so objectively. Goodreads simply isn't the place to look for impartial or informed ratings. 

However, as a librarian, it is an immensely useful metric to use for recommendations, or finding popular books. Certainly, then, you'd want to follow reviews that have more reviews, but 1,000 ratings might be a little steep. Something with 3 reviews that all laud a book as the next To Kill a Mockingbird should be taken with a grain of salt, but a few hundred ratings that fluctuate between 1-5 stars is good enough for me.

<TEXT> **Shadowbahn, by Steve Erickson** and **At the Existentialist Cafe, by Sarah Bakewell**

Kinda of my first foray into experimental/speculative fiction with Shadowbahn, but it's deeply entrancing and a welcome reading challenge. Seeks to describe the state of the U.S., unnervingly prescient in its characterization of the nature of the nation. Erickson also employs music and its historical provenance with such remarkable precision.

At the Existentialist Cafe is a fun, well-chronicled account of existentialist philosophers; their lives, their ideologies, and the enveloping history that spawned the movement as well as the world that was subsequently informed by the movement. There's a passage about Franciscan priests and nuns doggedly working to subvert Nazi destruction of influential phenomenology manuscripts by smuggling them out of Prague. Having just recently read The Name of the Rose and A Canticle for Leibowitz, that part really stuck out as a poignant real-world preservation of knowledge situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always like to talk about the intended themes that the author weaves into the narrative. Finding what the author has to say about their intentions for writing the work is usually informative, and helps frame some questions by connecting certain passages in the book to the overall themes. Looking up critical reviews for the book also helps to familiarize yourself with what other people notice. Bringing up points that reviewers mention to those in your club is always fun for sparking discussion. 

For me, I like to prepare discussion questions if I'm leading the talk, so that I always have something to pivot back to if the discussion strays for too long. Note some things down that kind of stuck with you, or seem controversial, and ask for what people thought about those passages. 

Another technique for me running healthy, friendly clubs is to feel the vibe of the group and try to challenge their assertions respectfully with some of the research you've acquired. Laugh along with points you might not necessarily agree with and then pose an alternative idea. Probably won't be too much of an issue to maintain a civil dialogue if you're doing it between friends, but just something to keep in mind, and helps to contribute fuller discussion.

<TEXT> It looks to me like you may have just taken land bordering their provinces. If you check your ally's diplomacy screen, you can hover over your relations to bring up a display that breaks down the specific negative modifiers in your relationship. Oftentimes, taking land near their own borders is encroaching on that nation's provinces of interest. You can check to see what each nation has marked as one of these PoI's in the diplomacy screen as well, in the tab for Trust/Favors.

You can see in this image below from the EU4 wiki the menu that should be selected. The mapmode should switch, showing the selected nation's provinces in green, provinces with claims in yellow, and provinces of interest in red. If you end up taking one of the provinces that they want, they'll probably end up becoming hostile.

I did Thomond into Ireland and got super lucky take the Irish isle without England or Scotland claiming any part of the it first. I allied France and Scotland and used their combined might to take London in the first war against England. Then began about 100 years of warring England, spitting out Wales/Northumberland/Cornwall, taking way too much land form England and firing a coalition war of European powers, appeasing the coalition forces by forcing France to release some small nations, then getting dragged into wars as Spain smelled a weak France and ate up its southern border, then using France's remaining manpower to finish off the rest of England, watching Spain viciously pounce on the struggling French, then dropping all my alliances to turn to fighting off a remarkably advanced Scottish military to finally eke out a domination victory in the English isles by 1630. It was a whirlwind of emotions, but this achievement was hella fun.

I assume the Ottomans will strike again once the treaty is up, and Skanderbeg might not be around during the next go of it. I guess the question is how to effectively neuter the Ottomans here while setting myself up for a successful Albania run.

<TEXT> As far as Economy goes, make sure to check the trade map and see all the centers of trade. Conquering those provinces which have higher trade value (specifically trade centers like Venice or Genoa, for example) will generate a lot money for you. Likewise, taking all the provinces within that trade node adds to the total income you get when placing a merchant there. However, controlling all the provinces in that trade node doesn't necessarily equate to boatloads of money, since a trade node like the White Sea in Russia isn't really all that valuable. You can check the value of each node in the trade menus. That's a down and dirty summary of trade. It's something to keep in the back of your mind when decided which provinces to take in wars. Taking a province in a trade node that you don't really have a lot of trade power in already, or don't have a merchant to really capitalize on there, it might not be financially beneficial for you to take. That's something I wish I knew a little earlier on, but I also started by playing mid-sized nations like Bohemia and Florence, so it's not so detrimental of a folly if you're playing the likes of Russia or France. 

Manpower and army management I've always struggled with, too. Recently I've become more aware of minimizing my losses in wars by manipulating my allies to fight as many battles for me so I don't have to lose out. Letting your allies take the brunt of the casualties takes patience, but it allows you to keep your manpower higher. Also what people have been saying about infantry mercenaries being super useful and cost efficient is true. 

Province improvements--and I may be wrong here--seem like just a way for the rich to get richer. It's hard to justify building churches in my provinces across Bohemia if I can only generate the 200 ducats needed to build one every 5 years. It's definitely better to build improvements early on to reap more, but if you don't have the money to spend, don't spend it. Only build a market in provinces that are centers of trade in a trade node you collect from, for example. Otherwise you're just bankrupting yourself for a profit you won't even see for 50 years. 

Alliances seem to be best made with nations that are not close to you. Using Bohemia again as an example, allying France is great if your intention is to take out much of the HRE nations, and even better if you're looking to expand east. For France, ally Castile/Spain if you don't care about the Iberian peninsula and want to mess up mainland Europe. In my experience, usually you shouldn't be too worried about your alliances restricting your expansion. You can always break alliances if they become a hindrance. Although, I have come across instances where playing as a newly formed Italy, France, The Ottomans, and Super Sweden become the wonder friends and completely block any expansion whatsoever. In those situations, it was usually a deference on my part throughout the course of the game in trying to limit any one of these three great powers. You have to try and predict who might be an issue later in the game (typically, France's military bonuses always set them up to be a powerful foe by the end, whereas the PLC/Russia/Ottomans start to fall behind on military effectiveness), and then plan around that. Understand the nation you're playing and know how strong surrounding nations are liable to become. Danish ideas are trash for military-focused runs, whereas Prussia is one of the most obvious, strong military nations. Therefore, if playing as Denmark, wipe out Brandenburg's potential to harm you later in the early game and ally yourself with France and hope you remain good friends!

These are just a few things I've grappled with, so hopefully some of it helps. There's simply way too much to try and explain, and I certainly don't have the mastery of this game to be the one to hit the more complex strategies that some of the ablest EU4 players employ. Definitely check out streamers or youtube channels of famous players like Arrumba or DDRJake or whoever else was mentioned. Good luck in your future campaigns! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Going off on a bit of a tangent, here, but your comment about how one can easily replace Civ's leaders with fantasy cultures is exactly what the game Endless Legend sets out to do. It's like this hidden gem of the 4X, turn-based strategy genre that does everything Civ does but better. Plug over. 

Civilization leans on history so much with familiar faces and cultural constructs--those "recognizable symbols of history" as mentioned in the article. It's a novel idea (Whoa ho! Ghandi is building the Pyramids, and amassing a giant army to wipe out the Aztecs!) that is just kind of stretched thin. It's disappointing that Civilization has this media monopoly on 4X games, and other more compelling and innovative games often go unheard of. 

However, while EU4 is certainly vastly different, comparing them doesn't seem so sacrilegious to me. The author of the article is aware that they are different genres, and is simply comparing them on how each approach historical content. In a way, he's actually contrasting the two games, even if he thinks he's striking a comparison (he says they each "highlight two starkly different approaches to historical source material"), since the bulk of the article is exposing the differences between the games. 

I mean, honestly, the outcome of this article only serves to bolster more exposure of EU4, simply because it is being "compared" to such a big name in video games. If his intention is to be biased toward EU4, he chose the right demographic to appeal to. What other high-profile PC game audience would even be minutely interested in a grand strategy game like EU4? Overwatch/League fans? Counterstrike or CoD players? The people that are going to read this article are mainly those curious as to why their much-loved game--Civilization--is being lumped together with something called EU4. 

So mainly, exposing EU4 to the Civ community will pay more dividends then most other loyal fanbases of other genres, and the author's intent to "compare" these two games in the same genre (despite the article solely contrasting two different approaches) could just be his way of facetiously bridging together like-minded demographics. In any case, I say the more Civ -- EU4 converts the better! </TEXT>

<TEXT> And as a related question, is the only mechanic for embracing institutions to purchase them once you reaching that 10% spread? Other than wait for it to spread through all provinces, of course. 

Because for nations like England, getting the Renaissance early in London is fairly quick and painless, but then you have all the land north of you is struggling to catch up. I don't want to wait for the spread, because that puts me behind, but dropping hundreds of ducats seems like a steep price, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh my god, I never thought how much I wanted the ability to depose popes and create antipopes until now. I've been reading the Name of the Rose, and that all about the feud between the Pope at Avignon and Louis IV, where the latter set up his own antipope in Rome after conquering through Italy. 

I think currently the Curia is pretty lame, and controlling it doesn't give much substantial bonus. Calling for crusades are cool I guess, and excommunicating helps me take lands from rulers around me, but I feel like there could be more depth in this field. Hopefully they make an expansion in the future around this area of the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. I'd say yes, but with two caveats: 1) You need to be the war leader to ensure you get what you want from the Teutonic Order, and 2) expect to backstab/break the alliance soon after robbing the Poles of their provinces. 

2. If you can, go for it. You can also see if allying Austria is feasible and coast along on the Emperor's good graces. It probably also depends on what you're planning on doing with Brandenburg, but I wouldn't put a ton of resources into weaseling your way into becoming the emperor until you get a solid foundation. Brandenburg does not have much power at the start, so strengthening your position should be your first goal. 

3. A lot of the time, Lubeck or Hamburg allies Riga, so I'd look to declare on them to take those free cities. You might be able to coax Poland into a war against the Livonian Order, set Riga as a co-belligerent, and steal Lubeck/Hamburg that way. In short, declare on their allies, or directly on them when the emperor is busy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Bohemia is pretty fun, and since they are landlocked, you don't necessarily have to worry about trading or colonizing if you don't want to. (Although I rushed to the Pomeranian coastline in one game ((HRE AE BE DAMNED)) and was able to start up Bohemian Colombia and control the Panama canal. Great fun). 

It is a pretty good alternative introduction to HRE mechanics, too, as you're a fairly strong nation that's not the typical powerhouses Austria or Brandenburg, and it has flexibility in the route you wish to take. In other words, because Bohemia doesn't really have an obvious track to take like Austria's diplomacy game or Brandenburg becoming Space Marines, the world is your oyster. The only downside to that is that aren't really any Bohemian specific events apart from the Hussite stuff in the beginning of the game to add flavor to the run. 

For flavor, the other post about Poland is a great idea, too. You don't have to worry about colonizing and trade too much with them either, but they become a lot to control if you're not used to managing PUs with large countries, and then immediately half x2 troops after incorporating them and becoming an empire. My first successful Commonwealth game was a little jarring when I went from casually declaring wars and letting Lithuanian AI do everything for me to actually have to manage all the giant stacks of military myself. Maybe I'm just a lazy war leader. 

Forming Italy is pretty fun, too, and you really only have to worry about placing merchants in Genoa or Venice in regard to trade. Florence-Tuscany-Italy was easy enough and rewarding back when I did it. 

TLDR; Bohemia for an alternative introduction to HRE play, Poland for more flavor and more overt power, or an Italian minor like Florence and form Italy and never worry about money again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like everyone has been saying, I agree with the Ottoman alliance recommendation. Denmark usually is never able to hold Sweden on its own, and has pretty bad military ideas. You say you don't mind helping them contain the Swedes, but I think it's a significant drain on your forces if you commit to that. In addition, a lot of the time the Scandinavians end up with missions to take Osel, or other Baltic states, or simply set them to high priority, so they wouldn't ally with you for long. I'd just let them go at each others throats for a while and clean up the region for yourself between Russian conquests. As Poland, grabbing as much of the Baltic Sea node is important. 

The Ottomans typically end up bordering Russia once both nations expand into the Caucasus, and will certainly be an able and willing ally for your wars. Plus, you should be able to backstab them and outpower their military eventually with your godlike cavalry bonuses. You know, cuz, remove Kebab and all that. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone, I'm going to be heading a discussion for my library's book club on The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco. I think my group will like the the underlying murder mystery story, but will certainly be confused by  heavy mention of the feud going on between the pope, the emperor, and the various monastic orders and their branch sects. Hell, even I'm a little lost, finding myself re-reading sections to get a firm grip on the situation. 

I would like to be able to provide a primer of sorts for the group, the month before they begin reading, to prepare them for what's important and try and clarify some of the history before they go in blindly. I'd look online, but as I haven't actually finished the book myself yet, I didn't want to spoil the plot. Basically, I'm asking for those of you who have read the book to provide the most essential bits of this whole historical context, in the frame of not ruining any part of the actual plotline, so that I can give my group a quick lesson on what's important for them to know to give them a fuller understanding the story. For example, I know I'll need to explain the relationship between the Franciscan/Benedictine orders as I'm sensing the significance it will have on the conflicting ideologies of William and the other monks.

As much as I would love to do a comprehensive history lesson, teaching my group about the complexities of 14th century secular vs. religious powers in Europe, it'll simply be too much. They typically only want to read CJ Box stories, so this whole literary historical murder mystery is a bit ambitious.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was allied to Bohemia, Sweden, and France, making GB, Spain, Russia, and the Ottomans rival me. GB only recently formed actually, like 50 years ago due to France messing up their island substantially. Sweden became the Protestant leader during the League War and has forever rivaled me since. France ate up the Bohemian throne and then broke my alliance to team up with Russia. My only friend had been Portugal for a century or so until Spain realized that I wasn't worth rivaling anymore. 

I don't really know how I can fight France at this point, and I probably won't even try. Their rise to power is on me, and I must suffer the consequences. Luckily, they won't rival me and don't seem to be inclined to go to war with me. Maybe we can just coexist (   )

What you've got going for you is a huge army. England seems to be pretty weakened, so taking London won't be difficult. If you can take all of Italy by 1600 and then spend the next 200 years or so grabbing all that coast line, it seems possible. 

What seems worrisome is that your aggressive expansion has pissed off a lot of people. The trick is going to be how well you can manipulate alliances, manage AE, and deter any kind of a meaningful coalitions from forming.

In regard to Kebab, they'll lose their potency later in the game. If you can ally PLC or Russia or even a strong Sweden/Scandanavia, you should be able to take what you need from them. I would think Kebab will be your final boss for the game. 

Make sure you're grabbing those other weird provinces like Zeeland and Vienna and whatever else the Roman Empire requires. If you go for it, share some pictures of the process! Good luck, sir. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think they've tried balancing the game more so you can't straight up declare war without consideration now. With Sweden I know the best strategy is to building up a fleet really fast and trap the Danes once they send their entire army to take back Gottland. I haven't tried in myself, but it sounds like it would effectively cut off all land units in your independence war so long as your navy holds the blockage.

Brandenburg also isn't easy in the beginning; their provinces suck. You need to utilize alliances more in the early game to get you into a good spot. Poland is a pretty easy alliance to secure with them, since you both have a common enemy in the Teutonic Order.

Easiest nations I think are the Ottomans and probably Muscovy. You can do almost anything you want to the small nations around you with little penalty. Ottomans are more forgiving, but Muscovy is fairly braindead, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't quite know the answer to all of these, but here's what I got:

2.) A lot of things go into how a battle is decided. The composition of your army factors in, so pretty much make sure your infantry/cavalry/artillery numbers are proportioned appropriately (I don't have specifics, but EU4 tells you not to have more than half your infantry in cavalry. I see a ton of people with like 10-12 infantry and 3-4 cavalry, which works out well in many cases). 

Military tech discrepancy plays a huge role in battles, too. If you're behind 1 tech, they're going to be much more effective. Obviously, if you're lagging behind 2-3+ you'll be pretty useless. 

Military generals also have an impact, and they have a simple ranking system of 1, 2, or 3 stars, with each rank being (generally speaking) significantly better. Each general has individual blips that indicate his strength in one of four categories (Fire, charge, maneuver, and siege) which give a more detailed view of why a general is ranked 1, 2, or 3 stars. If you don't have a general leading an army fighting against an army that does, that's bad news. 

Finally, terrain and defensive bonuses have the potential to really wreck your morale and fighting power. If you're Venice moving into Savoy, odds are you're getting negative modifiers for crossing into mountains or over rivers. Northern Italy is a mountainous region and is a pain to fight offensively in (from my experience). You want to try and maneuver around so that you avoid being the one on the offensive. You can tell if you'll get a crossing penalty when you pause and click to move your army to the target army. It should show a red minus sign where the battle is to take place. 

Considering you're losing 33k to 11k, odds are you are experiencing more than one of these potentially harmful effects. 

4.) If I'm reading this correctly, the country you want to gain trust with is a rival, and therefore, it's pretty much impossible to do so. Rivals are designed to dislike you until the AI decides you aren't a rival anymore. Honestly, I'm not sure the specifics pertaining to when AI feels like unrival-ing, but it probably has part to do with provinces of strategic importance and size of nation. If that country has claims on you, they want your land and probably won't rest until they get them or die trying.

5.) The only way I know of is you can enforce peace with the target of your ally, only if your ally has +100 relations. Most times the computer only accepts when they're losing, so it kind of defeats the purpose of the diplomatic action in my eyes.

<TEXT> Thank you I love you.

I've been doing another run before listening to any feedback and I've vassal-annexing Teutonic order and Holstein, and have vacillated between taking coastal HRE states alongside wars with Novgorod, Lvonian Order, and the Teutons. This has allowed me to pay off 2 coalitions that spawned (including probably 70% of HRE states) with 500+gold and East Frisia, or 500+gold and Stettin. 

It's 1500 now and liberty desire is under check for now (I rejected the Scandinavian Constitution like you said), I'm finally back down to acceptable levels of AE after 2 massive coalition wars took next to nothing meaningful, and Muscovy lost Moskva to the Golden Horde so now I'm just patiently eating them up and recovering cores for my vassalized Novgobear. 

I'm definitely going to look into getting Prussian ideas, as Poland actually took Danzig in its first war and are my only tangible rivals. Luckily they chose to not grab the PU with Lithuania. Barring I don't fuck it all up, this could be a decent run for the Danes. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Alright, How Do I Succeed with Denmark? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-22 23:35:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been trying to play Denmark recently and maybe I'm just horrible at managing PUs, but I can't for the life of me figure out what the best start would be. 

First, the beginning mission of "Danish Trade" (securing Danzig, Lubeck, and Neva) just seems completely unreasonable to do within any reasonable time frame. If I go for Novgorod, Muscovy rivals me. If I take Danzig, Poland hates me. If I somehow manage to take Lubeck, the entire HRE get upset. Should I just never take this mission, or do I need to employ some god-like level of patience in completing it? Pissing off three major powers around me while juggling with the liberty desire of Sweden is insane. 

And on the topic of Sweden, the minute any powerful nation rivals me, they tend to support Sweden's independence and the encroaching opportunistic war with Sweden bars me from trying to make any expansions. I've come to conclude that trying to keep Sweden under a PU is close to impossible, and I shouldn't bother trying to integrate them, so what's the best course of action regarding them?

Pretty much I integrate Holstein and Norway as soon as possible, and I can usually take quite a few Baltic Sea border territories by 1500 (Some of Novgorod, a lot of either the Lvonian or Teutonic Order, and sometimes a bit of Pomerania), but as I said before, usually Sweden or Muscovy or PLC decide it's time to reverse my advances. I have no idea how to create a strong start without it immediately crumbling and losing cores back to Sweden.

<TEXT> I'm fairly certain the coalition won't trigger if you accept a call to arms and enter on behalf of an entirely separate war.

Though, that's not to say the coalition members won't declare on you while you're fighting that war. You'll be treading a fine line there, but if they don't declare and you don't take any land in that war, you'll at least prevent Florence from any future coalition war for as long as you have a truce with them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I've learned is to drop allies before they start to bring you down. If you don't see Muscovy being able to fight back and put the PLC in check, then back out of the alliance. If you're strong enough to take on the PLC, though, either with Russia later or with other allies now, they could be a good target for you. The Baltic states would be great land to boost your trade in the Baltic node (ie. take the entire coast line away from whoever owns it.) 

Really, it's usually not simply "Who should I fight," but "How can I manipulate alliances to get me the land I want." If you're dropping Muscovy, try to find someone to take their place. If you want to keep them, understand they might try to call you into a war with the PLC in the future.

<TEXT> In regard to fabricating claims now, the difference is simply having to send a diplomat to establish a spy network and waiting for enough points to fabricate. It takes a few months, but once you get to 20+ points in the network, the "Fabricate Claim" option should be lit up in the Covert Actions tabs. Those 20 points then get consumed for the claim and viola! Back to your old conquering ways.

The only caveat is the cost to fabricate goes up for every action claim you have on a nation (20, 25, 30, and so on). I guess what also changed since the last time you played might be the default casus belli being humiliation wars if you're declaring on a rival. If you're not used to reading what casus belli you're using when you declare, now's the time to make sure you're not starting a humiliation war--these wars do NOT allow you to take provinces. (Humiliation wars are available for rival nations, almost as soon as you set them as such) </TEXT>

<TEXT> We don't need to analyze it unless people are trying to gauge the character of Dardoch. Looking at the way he presents himself during the interview: his posture (crossing his arms is typically a sign of defensiveness, and unwillingness to engage in constructive conversation) and the way he begins twitching into a smile when the crowd cheers him on shows an incredibly emotionally immature individual. He's letting his emotions guide his opinions, not the facts regarding how his team performed.

It's this kind of attitude that gets people riled up, and the same reason why when DL trash-talks people, others don't get as upset.  Dardoch is unstable and lets emotions dictate his opinions, whereas typical trash-talk is more benign banter and innocuous bravado. It's pretty apparent why he got suspended at the start of the season with this worrying, childish blame-game display here. He doesn't take full responsibility on what is objectively his team's fault for losing that game.

That being said, he's a teenager. He's so unique and divisive because he "speaks his mind," and I suppose that's why people think he's so edgy and great. But at the core of it he's a teenager who doesn't know how to appropriately deal with defeat. He won't develop positively as a player if he points to the reason of defeat on one teamfight, because that's the state of the game right now. "They're not the better team, not even close" is a statement someone oblivious, delusional, or simply emotionally heated would make, because while TL could be the better team, asserting that CLG is "not even close" is simply incorrect given they've beaten them in 2 series now. If he can't understand how to play the game all the way through to a win, then of course he'll lose and never get better. If he can't acknowledge that his team is much more close in skill level than the rest of the competition, then again, he'll continue to lose. It's kind of a part of growing up, accepting that you're not some invincible, special, unique little butterfly that deserves to win all the time. 

TL;DR For all the people defending him, saying he's merely showing confidence, they're wrong. He is clearly tilted based on his mannerisms and tone. He is, in fact, very tilted, and falls back on his usual display of defensiveness and brazen arrogance.

Who honestly cares whether this is trashtalk? It's his punk-ass busta mindset that should be a worrying trend for TL fans. </TEXT>
