<TEXT> Not my intentions at all. I've been in the US my entire life and I'm tired of all the hate, bigotry, and ignorance. It wears on you after a while. I just wish more Americans had values that a lot of Europeans and other nationalities hold so dear. We'd be so much greater than what we are now. I respect the hell out of what your family has done to provide you with the opportunity to reach your goals. I wasn't meaning for my previous comment to be in any way negative.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this about Europe. They seem to have morals and care so much more than us Americans. It sickens me sometimes how selfish and self-centered we are. Hell, we had athletes, who make millions each year, protesting our nation anthem. Granted, it has its issues, but it symbolizes our independence from Britain and the start of the greatest (past tense) country the world has (had) ever seen. I wish we could lead the world again in issues that truly matter. Instead, we make stupid asses like Danielle Bregoli famous for being ungrateful shit heads. It's ridiculous. I just wish our country could pick up on some of the values that Europe has.  </TEXT>
