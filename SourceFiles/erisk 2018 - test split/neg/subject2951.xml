<TEXT> You know those really popular snail jelly sheet masks from Korea that are all the rage right now? If youre into advanced skin care, youll know what Im talking about. Depending on where you are in the world, depends on how easy they are to get your hands on, and that also depends on how much they cost. I was *dying* to try one, but being a poor student, I didnt really have a lot of money to spend on them.  


I scoured the Internet for a bargain as I am wont to do, its part of life as a broke student. It was the early hours of the morning, and I was clutching a cup of lukewarm coffee during a break from one of my behemoth essays due by the end of the day. I was exhausted. Coffee wasnt really cutting it, and because I was snatching naps of two to three hours at a time but not getting any real decent sleep, guzzling caffeine and surviving on cheap trashy food was my mantra. My body was taking a real hit in terms of being healthy. I looked drained and worn out. I WAS worn out, my skin was grey and scratchy because my diet had gone to shit, and I hadnt felt fresh air or daylight properly for a couple of weeks. 

 
Lazily browsing one of my usual Internet bargain haunts, an offer flashed up onscreen for a pack of five low cost snail sheet masks. They were the cheapest Id ever seen, and in my sleep deprived and needy state, I quickly added them to my basket. I checked the horrific state of my bank account, and saw that I had just enough to cover the cost of them, especially since shipping was free on that site. I actually yelped with glee, and yes I know what youre thinking; a typical girly girl freaking out over a skincare product win, nothing sadder right? Well see, Im not usually the type. I dont really care about accessorising or manicures, if my hair is in the current style, and whether my clothes are in fashion. I dont really have time, and I definitely dont have the money. However I do know when I need to do something to treat myself, and I was very badly in need of some self care. I felt I was allowed one small victory after the last couple of weeks slogging my way through this mind-numbing essay. I knew the masks would be with me in a couple of days, as they were really fast with their shipping.  


Feeling inordinately pleased with my find, I set my coffee cup down, and decided that rather than trying to write a couple more hours into the night, that Id actually go to bed before 4am for once. I felt hollow inside, a shell of myself floating between uni and my flat with occasional trips to the pound shops for craptastic food bargains. As soon as my face mashed into my pillow, I sank down into a deep, heavy sleep that not even the strongest coffee could have kept me from.  


A couple of days later, they were laying there on the floor behind my front door in a dishevelled brown envelope. Again with the excited girly girl squeeing thing  I will admit I did it, but it was so out of character for me. Even in my exhaustion I was way too excited. Id met my deadline, and decided that I very much deserved an evening of pampering and relaxation. My flatmate was working evening shifts, and so it meant I could hog the bathroom for a while and have a soak until my skin went wrinkly. Running a bath and tossing a home-made bath-bomb into it, I turned a mask packet over to read the directions, after glancing through mostly unrecognisable text to find English:

  
*Apply at clean face, leave for fifteen / twenty minutes maximum. DO NOT LEAVE LONGER TWENTY MINUTES.*

  
I figured there was an error in translation, but understood what it was driving at. 


*That part must be really important,* I thought to myself as the bath was filling up and scented steam was swirling around the bathroom. Putting the packet on the corner of the tub, I dipped my toe in to test the temperature, and stepped in, sinking down into the deep purple bath-bomb glittered water. It felt *heavenly*. Id been taking super-fast showers every morning for the last few weeks, and had forgotten how wonderful it was to just spend time relaxing in a steamy room in hot water. I went through my usual cleansing routine, and finally unwrapped the mask. Unfolding it was a little fiddly, but I placed it over my newly washed face, pink from the steam of the water. It felt cool and soothing over my parched skin, and I closed my eyes and reclined against the back of the tub for the time it would take for it to take effect. Just being able to relax there in the quiet without having to worry about writing anything, and finally being able to reward myself, made me feel very content.  


which is about the point that I very *stupidly* fell asleep.  


You didnt see that coming? Im kind of surprised. Add one *exhausted* student with suffering skin, to one *gloriously* deep and hot bath steaming with a combination of sandalwood and lavender scents from a bath-bomb, along with a soothing face-mask shes been dying to try? Yeah. Thats not going to end well, is it?  


I came round a couple of hours later, in a bath full of cold water by waking myself up snoring. My only saving grace was the fact that the tub wasnt very long, so I couldnt actually sink underwater and drown. I was freezing cold, and so any relaxing effect of the bath was now long gone, and my skin? My skin was not only wrinkled to *allfuck*, but it felt prickly and oversensitive because of the cold. Swearing to myself harshly, my hands flew up to my face, and I peeled the mask off my skin carefully. How long had I been asleep? Id kept it on for waaaaay longer than was directed, but I didnt think it would be THAT big a deal, right? Ohgod was I ever wrong..


The only part of me that actually felt good, was the skin on my face. It certainly wasnt dry anymore, and though I was shuffling around the flat looking for layers of clothes to wear to get warm, I kind of saw it as a partial success. Sure, I might have been a weapons grade pillock and fallen asleep, but I did get to try the mask Id been wanting to try for a while, and I DID deserve it.  


Thirty minutes later, bundled up in two jumpers, a set of leggings, some thick striped socks and armed with a mug of hot chocolate, I was tucked into bed laughing at myself, and flicking through social media mindlessly before drifting back off to sleep. I was worried that I might have wrecked my sleeping pattern, but I was so exhausted that all it took to send me off again, was a belly filled with warmth. I didnt stir until the following morning when my alarm shrieked viciously at me to wake up. I knew the moment I felt it rip through me that something was very wrong.


My head was absolutely killing me. I figured it was a side effect of falling asleep in the bath, and waking up cold and tense as fuck. Scrabbling around in my bedside drawer for some painkillers, I blearily crammed them into my mouth, and swallowed them with the remnants of the hot chocolate that was now stone cold. Nice breakfast there, champ.  


I lay there for another hour, feeling quite dizzy and hoping the painkillers would have at least started to take the edge off, but no. I slowly pulled myself up, and felt profoundly nauseous to the point where I gagged, but nothing came up. Reaching up to my face to feel my forehead, my skin felt slightly clammy and weird. My temperature was way up, but my skin felt like quite the opposite. I moved very carefully to the bathroom, and peered painfully into the mirror without switching the light on. Light was too painful for my aching head.  


My skin looked*textured* in a way that wasnt normal. It was still the same colour, but it was peeling a little bit, in the way that the soles of your feet do if youve been wearing trainers on a hot day with no socks. I winced at the pain in my head, and figured that this was just a side effect of leaving the mask on for far too long, and that I was just tense from coldness of the bath which was likely what was causing my headache, and subsequent nausea. I relegated myself back to bed, and moaned into my pillow, grateful for the fact that I didnt actually have anywhere to be that day.  


Several hours later, my headache hadnt disappeared, in fact it had gotten considerably worse.  Clutching my head and fumbling around for my phone, I decided to text my mother, because I was feeling utterly rotten. Texting was interesting, because my eyesight was blurred, but thank fuck for auto-correct, right? Somehow, I mashed the right combination of letters in to ask for help, and waited in bed like I was expecting to die of a headache.  


Half an hour later, and she was rattling at the front door with her keys, and clomping up the stairs in her shoes. The skin on my face felt weird. It was cold and sticky, but I just assumed it was residual from leaving the mask on to long, and also because I was getting sick. Neither my mother or I were prepared for what we were about to see. She pushed the door to my room open with the creak it makes, and quietly approached my bed, leaning in to get a closer look.  


*What theOH MY GOD Francesca, what the fuck is that?!*

  
Its worth pointing out that my mother *never* swears. She just doesnt. If she does, it means something is terribly, hideously wrong. She lost grip of her handbag and something else she was carrying, and dropped to her knees on the floor. She fought for her phone from her bag, and immediately called for an ambulance. I was quite delirious at that point, and had no idea what she was shrieking about. Her horrified protestations and tears were ripping through my head and causing me more pain than Ive ever felt in my life.  


I can vaguely recall being lifted downstairs on what I thought was a stretcher, and loaded into an ambulance, but that was it until I came around in what I assumed was a hospital unit. It was not. My mother was sitting in a chair in the corner, her hands wringing, with an expression of horror and tired red eyes that told me shed not slept and had been crying heavily.


*Whereami..?* I tried to mumble but my voice cracked and broke.

  
My mother didnt answer, but sniffed tearfully and pressed the button to summon a nurse. She stood over me, wanting to touch me, but being afraid to. I tried to open my eyes, but when I did, everything looked slightly milky like I was trying to see through fine wet muslin or something. I tried to lick my lips but they felt weird, and my face still felt sticky and cold when I went to touch it. A nurse quietly came into the room with an interpreter.  


*Where am I?* I tried to say again, it not quite sounding right.  


A womans voice spoke up, clear and sincere. I could hear another language that I didnt recognise and flinched when I realised what the translator was for. Id been sedated for the last week, after being flown out to Seoul, South Korea. I could hear my mother sobbing in the background whilst the interpreter explained the situation to me. The masks Id purchased were cheap for a reason. They were not genuine Korean snail sheet masks, and were in fact some dodgy knock offs made in RUSSIA. *FUCKING RUSSIA.*  


I remained silent as I listened to the explanation that the masks had some seriously unpleasant side effects if left on for longer than twenty minutes. Theydo something to the skin, making it slick and produce mucous that resembles that of a mollusc. I hadnt cause sight of myself since the day I blacked out in my own flat, so I had no idea what they were talking about. Everything muted around me, my head was filled with white noise and panic.  


*Mirror..* I mumbled, or tried to.  


Nobody moved. Absolute silence.


*MIRROR!!!* I squealed, with something sounding more squelchy than Id like.  


My mother hurried over with a small compact mirror she always carried with her, and slowly opened it, handing it to me. She told me not to scream, that it was going to be okay, and that they were treating me and things would go back to normal soon.  


I didnt hear any of that of course, because as soon as I caught sight of myself in the mirror, milky sighted or otherwise, I screeched in a way that wasnt human, and it certainly wasnt me. The nurse mashed the button above my head until two larger nurses came in to help calm me down. My skin wasa dirty greenish brown colour that felt squishy and slimy to the touch. I was hyperventilating, and felt myself going lightheaded, involuntarily wetting myself with the stress of it all. The noises coming out of what I am guessing were my mouth were not human. *What do snails sound like when they scream? Has anyone ever heard that? Are they even capable?*

  
I felt a needle enter a point on my neck, and moments later I was sinking into unconsciousness. In hindsight, that was probably for the best given my situation, I mean its not every day you find out your face resembled the texture of a snail.  


I was not the only one.  Clueless westerners were buying these cheap fake Russian-pretending-to-be-Korean snail masks, and every so often one of us would have an accident and leave them on too long. It makes sense that the people who can fix it are none other than the brilliant people of South Korea, of whom manufacture genuine high quality masks that give our skin a treat.  I was fortunate that my mother could afford to fly me out to their clinic, because there are some people who havent been that lucky and now have to live out their existence looking very peculiar indeed. I might be a poor student, but my family is not. I was the one who wanted to stand on my own two feet and not be a spoiled middle class white bratty kid whos life was paid for by wealthy parents.  


I was told Ill be fine in around six months. The treatment? Sedation whilst dozens of snails oozed around my face, eating away the tissue that feels familiar to them. Once they eat through that, my own skin had to granulate and return to its normal state. This is a gradual process, the snails needing around ten sittings to do their miracle work. I was almost constantly sedated, because you really dont want to be fully conscious whilst snails eat your face off, nor do you want to be awake whilst it grows back.

  
Please dont ever buy cheap snail masks, no matter how good a deal they might look at the time, and if you do? Please make sure you take them off on time. Im not quite the same. I cant have any salt in my diet, it burns my skin. I have to keep my face moisturised with specially propagated mollusc slime to prevent skin desiccation, which isnt helpful because now Im absolutely fucking *terrified* of snails.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's why many sufferers end up institutionalised because it's so hard for them to exist in a world where they're seeing and hearing things that other people can't. They also end up homeless or worse. Whilst it's absolutely not fair that other people have to suffer the results of that as seen in the video, it makes me wonder what she was seeing VS what was actually happening. She clearly needs more help than she's getting. Folks who are messing with her head to make her think they're JB, are really shit. The article itself calling her terrible things is indicative of how people view those with extreme mental illness.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it's someone close to me, they have to do something significantly wrong, OR completely go against my ideals for me to want to cut them out of my life. Once I block, that tends to be it. I don't second guess it later. I have told people that I've needed space to 'think' on something we might have talked about, so that maybe we can revisit it later on with cooler heads, but generally for the most part, I don't change my mind about stuff when I've blocked someone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think doorslamming is a perfectly acceptable thing to do when you've been pushed to your absolute limit. It's a self defence mechanism, and at no point should we keep someone in our lives if they are toxic. It takes a LOT for me to doorslam, but I have done it, and I don't regret it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're absolutely allowed to put yourself first, regardless of if anyone comes forward here and tells you you're an asshole - you're not. Folks tend to come and say stuff like that whenever it comes to someone ending things with someone with mental health issues. I have them myself - and I had a partner who had some pretty severe ones, and I just couldn't do it anymore. I ended up making myself really sick, and that's when I decided I had to walk away. 

What you have to remember is, you're not actually responsible for her wellbeing in the long run. As much as it's probably going to be painful and there's a possibility that she *might* do something unpleasant, she also might not. It's great that you've chosen not to name the things she's battling, because people have a habit of having prejudged ideas about how stuff will pan out. Whatever you choose to do, you're going to worry about her obviously, but you have to worry about yourself too. That's absolutely okay.  </TEXT>

You're getting FREE education in Europe. You're complaining about not having money to get haircuts and go to bars etc, whilst talking about how you can't get the same financial help other people can, most students I know including myself have a job as well as having to PAY for their education, many of them are grateful to survive on ramen, and don't care about bars and haircuts. 

There are tons of homeless people, lots of them also commit suicide. Welcome to being an adult.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds like the opposite end of the spectrum to what I was living with - and very obsessive too which makes me wonder if they were battling actual OCD or the like. It's really, REALLY hard to remain objective when you're actually living IN a situation, because folks on the outside will almost always say, *have you tried this?*, and you might have tried everything so many time that it makes your head dizzy. When I was at the point where I was leaving stuff on the bed, I was genuinely at a loss for what else to do aside from leaving myself, or asking them to leave. In the end, I asked them to leave, which hurt like hell because we were good friends, and still are. It goes to show that you aren't always going to be compatible with living with all of your friends if you have opposing domestic habits. That's the short version, it was pretty complicated in the end. We're definitely better off for not living in the same space now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Football (soccer):*

A set of individuals paid entirely too much, running about in shorts and t-shirts, discovering new ways of flinging themselves on the floor, in order to curry favour with the referee so that a member of the opposition will be sent off the pitch. The object of the game, is to see how many times the team can get the peanut gallery to run onto the pitch armed with sponges and a stretcher to make everything better.

People gather *en masse* to watch such events, usually and generously marinaded in alcohol, to the point where they believe this is all very entertaining. Players can also be seen procuring the services of working girls, only to deny all knowledge of the fact later on. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hoping someone can help my friend and I with the etymology of a phrase.. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-16 15:57:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello :)

So my friend who isn't a redditor, but since I am, I'm asking on her behalf. Her mother is Lithuanian but she's not very forthcoming with information. When my friend was a child, she remembers her uncle calling her *shmekla* (written phonetically because she's not sure how to spell it properly and Googling hasn't really given her much in terms of answers). 

When she asked him what it meant, he told her this:

*You little girl like nymph. You appear from from nowhere and cause all this mess, then POOF, you gone and I clean up. Like Shmekla. Chaos. Go play.*

She desperately wants to know what the right spelling of the phrase is, what it means etc. She only has basic information about her family, and she's trying to learn what she can. She knows a few words and phrases and wants to learn more, but there's no Lithuanian community where she is now. She finds it hard to learn from apps and such, she needs people to bounce questions off etc.

Any help would be very much appreciated. I spent some time asking Google myself for her, but I can't find much, aside from learning bits and pieces that made me realise I'd love to visit one day.

Thank you in advance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's really frustrating when you're watching someone you care about making a mistake, and they don't seem to want to do anything about it, or they kind of dismiss it like it's doing to get better on its own. It's kind of like wanting to get hold of them and shake them up to say COME ON! Wake UP! Etc. Sadly that's not really how stuff goes cos there usually a bunch of circumstances that prevent things being that simple. Unfortunately it sounds like the only way he will learn, is the hard way. It's good that you care enough to get angry about this, so I hope you can still be mates even if it's at a distance etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's time to let him go. The thing is, him being ill inside is undignified for animals when they know they're supposed to do it outside, but can't because they're ill. When they get sick like this, they also decline mentally and they start forgetting who people are, they end up afraid and anxious and no amount of cuddles can settle them. It's not likely to get better because he's an old soul, and he already survived the odds. It's heartbreaking, I had to let my beloved bulldog go a couple of years ago because he was riddled with cancer. It was the hardest decision I had to make, but I didn't want him to suffer and lose his dignity because he was so sick and lost control of everything. I lost my heart that day. 

Ask your vet to come to your home and do it, so your doggo can be surrounded by familiarity and people who love him. It's time to let him go.  </TEXT>

Blokes use them if they're not very well endowed, and also might be made to use them so they can give pleasure, but not feel an awful lot. The latter seems to be a thing with kink couples where pleasure is only granted to the dominant side of a couple for headfuck reasons etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry to upset you mate - I'm in forensic psychology, I happen to know a fair amount about masculine behaviour. Right now you're having a mantrum because you're outraged about something that hasn't even happened yet. The ideology of subscribing to a pecking order whereby one party is cuckolded at the hands of another, is indicative of the way hegemonic masculinity works, and is in fact perpetuated when testosterone fuelled men beat their chests and rage, rather than stopping to think like a reasonable human being. But sure, keep on fuelling those flames, it'll be dead helpful honest.  </TEXT>

And if the OP does indeed come back to say he got fucked over, then that would be horrible and unfortunate as fuck, but see here's the thing, *asking mr ripped what he's after and telling him to back off* will likely give him the info and/or confirmation he needs to read folks the riot act for being shit. Or you know, everyone could just carry on assuming without actually figuring out the extent of any bullshit involved. Cos if she's got plans to be unfaithful, wouldn't you rather know beforehand so you could keep some dignity and tell all concerned to go forth and multiply? 

Or maybe just listen to a few blokes who clearly haven't evolved past knuckle dragging stage. Gee.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not mentioning him isn't the same as saying that she doesn't have a boyfriend in her life. Again it would be weird to try and be secretive with an open phone and password policy. Think about what that means. She trusts her partner the OP to look at her stuff. She wouldn't do that if she was up to no good. Really I think this has blown out of proportion, and maybe a conversation with all three people at the same time time would clear stuff up, and soon before it ends up eating a hole into things moreso than it already has.  </TEXT>

If she genuinely doesn't think it's an issue cos the same pics are available for all to see on his page, then it's clear she isn't sexualising that. Someone else suggested she might be naive, which is also possible; but if this dude is zoning in on her; the OP should take it up with him and tell him that's absolutely not okay. Some folks respect the fact that others are in relationships, and some don't. If he's zoning in on her, he either knows she's involved with the OP and doesn't care, or he doesn't know and thinks she's a free agent or something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No - it's not her fault that a bloke decided to send ripped photos of himself to her. Weirdly enough, men like to do that along with other more southern parts of their anatomy, which he hasn't done. Again they have an open phone/password policy which is how this came to light. Cheaters cover tracks etc. If anything, the OP might want to get in contact with the guy to ask him what his motivations are. It's not really fair to blame her for the behaviour of someone else putting topless photos into view. 

It probably wouldn't hurt for a conversation with everyone involved to happen, so as to allay any fears. If he's got ideas about her, then it's the perfect time to say hey okay, that's really not on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think sharing memes and superficial conversation equates to an emotional affair. I have three super close friends I converse with on a daily basis, along with a few other friends and my partner. Some days I talk to my best friend more than my partner because we have more to talk about for whatever reason. My partner could be super busy at work, or he might be tired. Sometimes I go a couple of days between texting friends and then we will text frequently on others. These things vary. The point is that my friends and my partner are all aware I love them and they have value for their own reasons. Sharing memes and such really shouldn't be an issue, especially when they have an open phone/password policy with one another. If something were going on, it would be way more than it is now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> See that to me SCREAMS that she's had a tough time in the past. Talking about things openly can be indicative of two things, genuine sexual honesty which is totally okay, OR at some point she's been mistreated sexually/emotionally and has developed inappropriate sexual boundaries as a result. It's hard to realise what is and isn't okay to talk about when you're confused about sexual experiences that weren't positive. Listen to her words. If she saying you're the nicest guy - ask yourself WHY is she saying that? a.) yes you seem like a nice bloke, but b.) does that also mean that men haven't been so nice to her in the past? If you're the nicest guy she's encountered, how have the others treated her? Is she hypersexualised because men have taught her it's her only worth to them? This stuff tends to be a can of worms. If anything I think what she needs right now, is someone to let her be honest with. You might get upset hearing about past stuff, but you're not her partner so really as her friend, letting her talk about that stuff might actually be the best thing you can do for her, AS a friend. Just remember to tell her that if she wants to confide in you, it's got to be platonic for now. 

A lot of women feel their only worth to men is sexual. Whilst you're telling her you want more, if she's only ever known sex without a healthy relationship, it's hard to get used to. The fact that folks are referring to her as a skank etc, is evidence that she's only being seen as a fuckable object by folks outside the equation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay first up - folks who are saying this girl is a skank or using you should shut the entire fuck up. Oddly enough, people are allowed to sleep with whom they please if they're not up for commitment with someone. If a man had slept with the same number of people she has, he'd be hailed as a stud. It's a shitty double standard. 

She doesn't want commitment, and as much as you want her to, it won't happen if that's not how she's wired. You can either tell her FWBs is okay with you without commitment, or you can move on. She might still want you around, but just as you need to accept she can't give you an exclusive relationship, she needs to accept that you're looking for different things. Regardless of her wanting you around for intimacy, you need to pull away from her in that way because your commitment Lego isn't compatible.
 
Also, she might want to share your company as friends, it's totally okay to want to get to know someone that way too, as apparently bizarre as that might be for some folks to grasp. You need to draw some lines in the sand. She might be trying to see if she can trust you long term. How much do you know about her past outside of the incident where she was cheated on? Has she been open with you? Does she clam up in any respect when you talk?

<TEXT> Dude - google it. It's not my job to educate you. I don't agree with circumcision either, it's barbaric. People crop ears for two reasons - a misguided notion that floppy ears cause infections, and aesthetics. Some dogs are predisposed to ear infections such as spaniels because of their genetics. However, the breeds that tend to undergo cropping, are breeds that aren't genetically predisposed to ear infections. It's only done to make animals look more fierce. So pits, dobies, danes, mastiffs etc, aren't predisposed to ear issues. 

Dogs emote with their ears and their tails, and so cropping them takes part of their ability to do that away. Sure his ears are still partially there, you haven't cropped them right down, but some folks leave them with tiny pointed stubs that heal badly and end up sore and infected.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bollocks. If you crop a dogs ears - any breed, you're taking away their body's natural defence to protect the inner ear and such. They have floppy ears for a reason, and you and many other idiots who crop dogs ears, leave dogs exposed to increased likelihood of ear problems. Their floppy ears act as a protective barrier. Unless their ears have been damaged or torn because of an accident, they should be left alone. You're clearly more concerned with aesthetics. 

We don't crop ears or tails here at all, because it's bullshit. Unnecessary cosmetic stuff just to satisfy your idea of what a dog should look like? Crop your own ears.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It got really messy. I had him removed from our home twice, within the space of a week. First time three policemen turned up. Second time they sent six, because he'd kicked off within that week so they made sure to send reinforcements because he was like a raging bull. He was trying to make amends for weeks but I rebuffed him. He tried many tactics, guilt trips, pretending to go out on dates to make me jealous (it didn't work because I was at my limit) and eventually I had to block him and warn him away from me otherwise I'd have the police involved again. Eventually he stopped trying to reach me, but it took a while.

I discovered the details of who he really was soon after, and uncovered the lies he'd been telling for years. He'd abandoned his son twice, had a massive hard drugs problem and was incredibly unfaithful in all his relationships. He was horribly abusive and manipulative, and I'd just had enough. 

I found out about six months after I threw him out, that he had met someone and MARRIED them in that short time. It didn't last because now they're separated because I'm guessing she also had enough of his shit. I'm entirely over him, but it took me a long time to process and deal with the anger he left me with.  </TEXT>

You're going to feel broken for a while. It's hard to remember to breathe when your life was just torn down. You have to take everything in small bites. Recovery for me took a couple of years and therapy to deal with the blinding rage I finally felt after I'd done feeling hollow and cleft. The thing about that rage is that it helps keep your afloat long enough to get you to being human again. 

Do you know if his daughter will be safe?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Identifying that she needs help is part of being compassionate. It doesn't automatically turn her into a person who can't be reasoned with. Offering compassion for him should include workable solutions to his situation, otherwise it's just like saying, *sorry dude, I feel bad for you, but I'd run away.* He clearly has feelings for her, otherwise he wouldn't be asking here. Walking away from her would hurt him just as much I'd venture, even if she does need to address her problems.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's probably time to talk to her about getting some help for her anxiety and clear self esteem issues. Trouble with both of those things is that they're irrational and really unkind to the person experiencing them, which in turn causes that unkindness to project onto folks around them. You shouldn't be an emotional punching bag for her, but tell her you want her to get some help so she can at least breathe a bit. You can be supportive, but don't enable it by letting it chip away at it any more than it already has. At the end of the day, if she won't seek help, then you'll have to make a decision as to what you want to do. You can help and be supportive to someone yes, but if they refuse to seek help for themselves independent of that, then it's okay to tell them that it's not fair and you need to think. She obviously realises she's being difficult to be around right now, but knowing that and doing something about it, are two very different things.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not nice to be on the receiving end of that, but her behaviour seems like she's battling with mental health issues that need addressing. Her reaction to some of the sounds you make made me think of [Misophonia](http://www.misophonia.com/symptoms-triggers/), but that's just off the top of my head. It seems like you're trying to be accommodating, but you're both struggling with this to the point where it's adversely affecting your lives. Her stress levels are clearly elevated, and yours are because otherwise you'd not be posting here.

You might have to wait a little longer, but usually victims will defend their abusers for a while before they reach their wits end.

Unfortunately, it's hard for people to break out of a cycle of abuse because of the control their abuser has over them.

That, or you don't love him like you used to, and want to be able to have fun elsewhere whilst you rely on him for stability. As a poly person, it's folks like you that ruin it for those of who know how to do poly for real.  You're getting negativity because you're being a total shit. Have your sexuality, but you can't have him too.

It's entirely possible to love someone you've never met, especially if you talk to them constantly and share things about yourselves that show vulnerability. Unfortunately it doesn't always end well, which is pretty much the scenario here. 

His ghosting her is really insensitive though, he could have at least said goodbye. It's not fair that the OP is flailing on her own, and he has his life to go back to. 

OP, do you have a circle of friends to lean on for support, or was this one of those situations where you kept everything secret because of his being married? Even if it was, if your friends love you, they will at least try and help you with this so you're not alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Truthfully, you're probably not going to be able to make a whole lot of sense of your thoughts and emotions surrounding this, because your brain is probably trying to feel ALL THE THINGS at once, AND try and rationalise things in a way that you can work through it. It seems like you're in the *numb* stage right now, where you cry a lot, but can't decipher what you need to do. That's entirely normal. 

It's also not unusual for people close to offenders like this to stick around, because when you form attachments, it's hard to immediately turn your back and release them. You're likely having the same issues now. You can only handle things like this in small chunks. It wouldn't be a bad idea to seek out therapy to help you work around it.  </TEXT>

People on the thread comparing being poor as 'colour' frustrate me, because as much as race, class, and social status intersect, they're different experiences.

<TEXT> She could have sworn she turned off the television set before she'd gone to bed the night before. Her brow furrowed as she stood in front of it, stooping down, moving closer. Something definitely didn't seem right. Her mother wasn't up yet, so it couldn't have been her--and she definitely remembered switching it off.


She felt drawn in, her breath swirling out to meet the static. It left a steamy circle behind, the static prickling back against her lips with a tingling sensation. She dragged her teeth over her lips to stop the tickle, blinking softly and straightening herself up again. Her gaze changed to a gradual stare as she looked at the screen for a full five minutes.


That's when it happened.


The screen looked fluid. Screwing her eyes shut and blinking rapidly, she tried to clear her sight thinking her eyes were playing tricks with her. She'd been staring for so long, it had to be the same sensation she felt as a kid when she sat too close to the set. She tried to look away, but felt a flash of pain behind her eyes in her attempt.


A single soft ripple moved outward from the centre, moving slowly toward the edges, only to disappear.


She leaned in again, raising her right hand slowly, reaching out to the screen, her fingertips feeling the static millimetres away. Her hair, as yet un-brushed and a little fluffed up, reached toward the static like fine tendrils twisting to wrap around something.


It grabbed her, beginning with a sharp pinching sensation in her hand, trickling its way up her arm. It was viciously cold, and she panicked, her breath quickening, turning into a strangled whimper. It crept painfully up over her shoulder, her skin tightening, draining of all colour. It moved up toward her face, oozing across her jawline, and up to her lips. She was completely rigid with fear, unable to move or make a sound for help. Her lips parted and cracked in a silent scream, the teeth in her mouth shattering like tiny crystals, each feeling like burning needles driven deep inside her. Blood built and seeped over her greying lips, trickling down her chin and onto her nightdress. The blood vessels in her nose exploded, pissing down over her feet and onto the carpet. She tried to look down, but her eyes were frozen in their sockets.


Reaching up for her eyes, the irises turned a stark white, sucking the life from her pupils to leave nothing but a glassy stare. More blood spilled over her face as the capillaries broke, leaving bloody tears running over her seemingly lifeless skin. She stood completely motionless; a stiffening statue with every molecule in her form freezing and twisting. It continued to move down the other side of her body, pinching and biting all over, the static ripping more of her into its field.


It finally took control of her completely, pulling her into its void. She could hear thousands of screaming voices, old and young alike, all clawing at her mind relentlessly.


Her eardrums ruptured, and joined the other streams of blood coursing over her body. The pain was horrific, and it only seemed to build. From the other side of the screen, she could see her blood from the carpet pool together, lose its colour and seep upwards into the screen to join her.


It was as if she was never there; she was completely gone to the world, part of the white noise on-screen. Something shifted in her throat, and she let out a piercing scream. It sounded like someone tearing nails down a blackboard, and with every scream came a splatter of blood, draining of colour and settling on-screen.


Feeling an overwhelming presence behind her, she turned around and saw thousands of bodies in the same state, reaching out with their cracked skin and shrieking voices. She screamed again, turning back to the screen, pounding her fists against it.


The creak of a door upstairs signalled the arrival of her mother, who padded softly down to the living room. Frustrated and terrified she banged harder, desperately trying to scream for help. All that came was blood and that sickening shrieking. She watched in horror as her mother picked up the remote, shook her head and turned off the set.


She obviously didn't hear her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not your fault. 

The problem with being sexualised early on, is that the body learns to zone out and just wait for it to be over. If you're not naturally assertive, standing up for yourself can be difficult. The moment you don't tell men who are touching you to stop, the more they will keep doing it if they are the handsy type. 

I think telling your boyfriend would be good for support, but it seems like you're worried about his reaction. Are you worried that he will think you've instigated anything?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My beautiful olde tyme bulldog had to be euthanised last year because his body was riddled with cancer. He'd saved my life twice, and he was a light for me when I couldn't see any other. I had him put to sleep at home so he wouldn't be scared. I held him and his body fell against mine as he took his last breaths. I have never sobbed so hard in my entire life. He was brain damaged from birth but he had a full and wonderful life. Losing him was the worst pain I've ever felt. I cried like a baby for so long. 

You don't know pain until you've lost an animal. They give you unconditional love with ever fibre of their being.  </TEXT>

Could you move on and potentially find another BFF that you can bond with and have a more rewarding and stable friendship? Do you think she can make that critical professional introduction for you regardless of any friendship issues?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're doing the right thing writing this stuff down.  Write down how you would feel to be clean every day, how healthy it might make you feel and better about yourself. I used to live with someone who had a fear of showers but it was down to the fact that they were autistic and the sensation and sound of running water was one of their absolute no-no things. As you can imagine it made life quite difficult. We helped them by trying to make positive associations with the running water; playing their favourite song on repeat for example, and also telling them it would all be over in five minutes etc. You're definitely not alone with this. 

If you choose to go and seek help, a psychologist that specialises in exposure therapy might be useful for you. They specifically help people face fears and the like, if other options have failed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This feels like a potential obsessive compulsive response to a stress situation. What you need to do is speak to a professional and ask for guidance. In the meantime, write down what your worst case scenario is when you are showering. Are you afraid of being caught naked? Is it that people will make fun of you or take photos and humiliate you etc? 

For every negative worry, try and write down a logical and rational response. Remind yourself doors are locked. It's okay to tell yourself these things when you shower out loud, or in your head. 

Do you have any other areas where you are concerned about control that aren't related to showering? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh boy. Yeah that's a real let down. I see other people asking if he's likely to have something planned for later, but I get the impression that's not really his style? 

You're not overreacting, your reaction is totally valid since he seems to have issues with communication and made a promise he can't deliver. The crux here is that he made you a promise that both of you probably knew he couldn't deliver. He shouldn't have made it, and you (knowing that he was bad at this) shouldn't have expected him to be able to do it. The problem is that peoples' behaviours don't change unless they actively make efforts to change them. It sounds like his therapy needs kicking up a notch, or you both need to realise this isn't going to be forever.  </TEXT>

You mentioned hoarding and her obsession with your making your bed, and the barrage of phone calls etc. I get the impression that OCD might be a factor here which can be very hard to rein in. Asking someone with OCD not to compulse, is like asking them to stop breathing. It doesn't work (My background is psychology).  

You've basically got two choices here, 1.) move out and talk to her about some therapy that can help her get a hold of her control issues. 2.) stay home and talk to her about therapy to sort out her control issues. For your sanity I would recommend the first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay let's look at things from another viewpoint. If her parents have raised her this way, it might be all she's ever known. It doesn't matter if she's seen other places that are clean and tidy, but kids follow the behaviours of their parents. If that's the environment she was raised in, that's the environment she's going to be used to. Take her out of it, show her what clean and tidy looks like and show her how to achieve it. If you love her, tell her you love her and tell her you want to help her. 

You also need to remember that there might be other issues at play. If anyone in her family is suffering with any kind of depression, then that can have an enormous effect on being able to keep things clean and healthy. There are a lot of outside factors that could be causing that level of squalor, but feel them out first before you do anything. I lived with someone like this for a while and he was just a lazy shitbag, but don't write her off until you know for sure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Men have meaningless sex all the time sweetie, it's what they do. It sounds like both of you are under pressure from your parents and there are your insecurities that you need to work on, along with your temper. He might be scared of you. There are a lot of what ifs. If he can't make up his mind about things, you need to make up your mind for yourself. It's hard to get past that horrible gut wrenching sick feeling you get when you break up with someone, but you can't let that do the thinking for you. 

We are all capable of platonic friendships with the opposite sex, but you need to stop getting angry about his business partner. If he can't handle being with you because of insecurities and pressure from parents then you're just going to have to let him go. Take things five minutes at a time. It's hard to see past heartbreak when every fibre of your being hurts, but you CAN do it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He sounds like a controlling asshole to be quite honest. He realises we are in fact in 2016 now; right? Asking for passwords to social media and objecting to your not following his lead, are red flags.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do NOT like people taking my photo at ALL. All of my friends know not to do that to me because of reasons I'm not going into. I'd have taken the phone from her and deleted them all myself because she is WAY out of line for doing that. Her having a tantrum is ridiculous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He is clearly a mess and you don't need that mess around you and your unborn baby, or after the baby is born. Don't ask him to leave, just call the police and ask them to remove him because he seems like he might be an absolute BEAST if you don't have backup there.  </TEXT>
