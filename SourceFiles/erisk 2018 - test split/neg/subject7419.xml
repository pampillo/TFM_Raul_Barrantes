<TEXT> [The photo was taken on August 4, 1970 when Holleman was 25. In a meadow in Nootdorp photographer Hendrik Jan Koldeweij shot up to 150 photos. One cow stood watching, the others ran away. Holleman spread her arms and looked up, it was her own idea. The photos were originally intended for the magazine Sekstant of the Dutch Society for Sexual Reform. Holleman did not know at the time that the photograph would be used for a election poster for the PSP. She sued and the case was settled for 1250 guilders.](https://vrouwen-uitvaart.startpagina.nl/forum/topic/2028161/blote-campagnevrouw-psp-dood/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article only specifically calls out the two black and white photos with the two guys as being for the play which as you say was 1970. In the early to mid 1970s she was on Maude. The article is still talking about the play on the page where the posted photo was featured but when this photo is called out they are talking about The Tonight Show and use the phrase first bloom which I thought was a double entendre about the flowers and her first nude shoot. I assumed all of the color nudes were from the playing card shoot which the article describes as in the mid 1960s on Page 23 and her earliest nudes [on the cover.](http://i.imgur.com/rf4gYY4.jpg) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am now almost certain the posted photo was taken at the southeast corner of Summer and Atlantic in front of South Station looking generally north. Comparing [a section of the Getty photo](http://i.imgur.com/AJPY9Ev.png) to [one of the photos in this series](http://i.imgur.com/LaaxqY1.png) shows 6 objects that match with the only difference being the second sign that you have pointed out. This sign must have been added sometime between the two photos.

In addition to the objects the shadows generally line up and in the background of the companion to the posted photo you can see gas pumps. In the 1955 Boston directory there is a service station at 184 Summer, see R A F Service near the [top left of this page](https://archive.org/stream/bostondirectoryi02bost#page/1695/mode/1up), which is the northeast corner of Summer and Atlantic.

<TEXT> When you say two at right angles at the real SS, I assume you mean the tunnel entrance at the southeast corner of Summer and Atlantic which can be seen left of center in the Getty image previously linked. It looks like there was and still is a tunnel entrance at each corner of Summer and Atlantic. Reference the Getty image previous linked, [this photo](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:8c97mg28m), [this photo](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:8c97mj90h) and [this google street view.](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3523938,-71.0549001,3a,75y,300.61h,83.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sw42EddqZl8GM61HsGPmfSg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)

There was [a streetcar route on Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston-area_streetcar_lines#7) and as you pointed out there is a streetcar in the background of some of the photos. It would make sense that all those sailors would be at the train station. Based on this and the other clues mentioned my gut feeling is the photo was taken near South Station but I can't prove it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> SunCalc appears to be using the users local time and not the time at the chosen location. When I use the NOAA Solar Calculator where the time zone is a variable I get the same results as you. I am on CST so that means the time of the photo was closer to 8 am than 10 am. None of the Operation Teapot tests match that time frame. Maybe the article is wrong about the 1955 build date of the pool and it really is 1953. [The Dixie, Encore and Grable tests of Operation UpshotKnothole in 1953 were at 7:30 am.](http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Upshotk.html) It is not Dixie because it had [a mushroom "cap" but no stem.](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/05/18/friday-image-the-dixie-showgirl-1953/) I found some images that are indicated to be of Encore and [one of them](https://i.imgur.com/pYtaNmU.jpg) matches [this other photo](https://i.imgur.com/OjQogdo.png) taken just after the posted photo. [This image of Encore from wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Upshot-Knothole_Encore_(1953\).jpg) also looks similar and the images I have seen of [Grable](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Upshot-Knothole_Grable_007.jpg) don't seem to match very well. I will try to verify the pool build date through another source but until I can do that I now think the photo is of the Operation Upshot-Knothole Encore test.

Edit: About a quarter of the way down on [this page](http://www.lvstriphistory.com/ie/fron1950.htm) it says the new pool was under construction in August of 1952 and [one of the photos in this series is at Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.com/license/515279938) with a date of May 8, 1953 which is the date of the Operation Upshot-Knothole Encore test. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look further down on the Operation Teapot link past the Wasp test on Feb 18. The Wasp prime test was at 10 am on Mar 29. Also look at the other tests. Most are before daylight. Anyway if the sign changeovers from The Last Frontier to the New Frontier happened after April 4 then a couple other Operation Teapot tests are possiblilities.

[The old pool](http://digital.library.unlv.edu/objects/sky/170) was between the highway and the front of the hotel. [The pool pictured](http://digital.library.unlv.edu/objects/sky/79) is in the courtyard and is definitely the new pool.

<TEXT> [The source at the Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ncl2004003081/PP/) indicates that the year is 1913.

The full caption reads: 11:30 A.M. Jennie Rizzandi, 9 year old girl, helping mother and father finish garments in a dilapidated tenement, 5 Extra Pl., N.Y.C. They all work until 9 P.M. when busy, and make about $2 to $2.50 a week. Father works on street, when he has work. Jennie was a truant, "I staid home 'cause a lady was comin'."

<TEXT> No. The name comes from the fact that it is a long event. It would typically consist of 75 to 125 miles of mostly off road riding. Riders were supposed to arrive at a checkpoint on a specified minute and were penalized for arriving early or late. Some sections might be easy and make it easy for the rider to go too fast and some sections might be difficult and make it hard for the rider to go fast enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the link. I assumed the blog was going by something they saw in the photo and you could point that out for me.

If I could look at the Taurus then I would just check the VIN plate. I know VINs weren't around in 1916 but I assumed that since they owned the vehicle there was a title/registration that identified the year.

Seems unlikely but it is possible that the date refers to something else other than the year of the car.

Anyway, thanks again for the information. </TEXT>

How can you tell the hood is unpainted aluminum? It looks the same as the rest of the car except the doors to me.

What about the date on the door? Have you dismissed that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you say so. The one shown at the Ford Model T blog I linked to is identified as an early 1916 and it looks like it has unpainted brass headlight rims. Also, at the time of the photo the car is over 20 years old. Isn't it possible the lights were replaced with the earlier type? After all it does say spawned in 1916 on the door. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do agree with you but to compare the calculations in my comment you would have to use the lp/mm at MTF 30% for Velvia which I believe is 80.

To go one step further, using your starting point, if you go to a large format 4x5 that gets multiplied times 15 to give about 2.6 gigapixels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To further nitpick, film does have an effective resolution. [It is measured in line pairs per mm.](http://i.imgur.com/U4M8Yjq.png)

A color negative or transparency film of that era probably had a resolution of about 50 lp/mm. Assuming a 40% loss through a good lens that would yield a digital equivalent of 1524 ppi. A 36mm x 24mm, 35mm frame would be a digital equivalent to a 2160 x 1440 pixel image. You would probably scan the image at least twice that resolution to preserve detail though. Note that the image in this comment is 2048 x 1372. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have already seen the forum posts you referenced and dismissed them as anecdotal but they did lead me to the 200,000 in 1949 number from the Model T book which is what I was looking for originally. When I first saw the photo I was surprised by the age of the car so I was curious about how common the Model T was at that time.

I don't really care about concessions either. My original reply to you was meant to be informative not argumentative. Anyway, it is all cool and I am glad you enjoyed the photo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, wikipedia says 16.5 million. Not significantly different. Leno is an enthusiast. Maybe a knowledgeable enthusiast but he is not an expert. The two lower estimates don't specify worldwide but the UK link says 600 in the UK and 100,000 worldwide. Just because the kid is young doesn't make him wrong.  I don't know what the age of the guy on the video has to do with it anyway. I am not young either but if I see at least three sources, four counting the young guy in the video, say that there are 100,000 or less surviving Model T's, I would go with that. Your point stands just as well without an exaggerated number of surviving cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This technique was actually used in logging. Large tree trunks were spread wide at the ground, and were dripping with pitch.  It would have been difficult to saw through a tree at ground level.  Instead, the lumberjacks built a scaffold, a framework of poles and planks, around the tree.  They climbed ten to twenty feet above the ground on the scaffold and cut notches into the trees trunk. Then they inserted a platform called a springboard into the notches.  Up there the wood was soft and the pitch was only in pockets. [Here is a video from the same time period as the photo of lumberjacks using this technique.](https://youtu.be/3MDgxNLDR64?t=2m34s) Skip to 2 minutes and 34 seconds if the video does not start there. I am not sure if they still do this in competition but [here is a video of a recent springboard chop race](https://youtu.be/CUG-LJ6UNN4) which is a similar competition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is from [Bill Owens' series Suburbia.](http://www.billowens.com/suburbia/) 

[Here is what he had to say about the posted photo](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/27/bill-owens-best-photograph-tupperware-party-1970s-california): Tupperware is a classic, as American as apple pie. Its tied up with the dream of plenty, but its also about being thrifty, so you can preserve both your food and your way of life. The woman hosting this party is standing beside me. Shes not in the shot. And look at her shag carpet! Shed recently bought a rake to make it stand up two or three inches. You could walk across it and see your footprints.

The lady standing up wasnt friends with the others, though. She was a professional salesperson who went from town to town within a 30-mile radius, working on commission. Here shes selling a standard eight-quart bowl and spinner. On the side of her coat you can see all the awards shes won for outstanding sales. This woman devotes her life to selling Tupperware and shes dressed up nice. I love her white boots. You wouldnt know it from their deadpan faces, but I can assure you that this was a lively party. The ladies were all having fun. Theres a glass of wine in front of each of them, and thats a sure sign of a good time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Waddy's Wagon" was the fifth B-29 to take off from Saipan on the first raid on Tokyo, November 24, 1944, and the first back. On January 9, 1945 it took off from Saipan to bomb the Nakajima Aircraft Factory in Musashino, Japan. The crew attempted to guide a crippled B-29, Miss Behaving, back to Saipan but "Waddy's Wagon" had also sustained hits from enemy fighters and the plane was ditched in the Pacific Ocean.

Holding "Damit", the plane's mascot, is Capt. Walter "Waddy" Young an All-American footballer with Oklahoma University in 1939 from Oklahoma. On top, left to right, are Co-pilot Lt. Jack "Cactus" Vetters from Texas; Gunner Sgt. Wilbur "Sleepy" Chapman from Texas; Navigator Lt. Paul "Gat" Garrison Jr. from Pennsylvania; Gunner Sgt. Lawrence "Lucky" Lee from North Dakota; Gunner S/Sgt. Joseph Gatto from New York; Radioman S/Sgt. Kenneth "Windy" Mansir from Maine. On the ground, left to right, are Bombardier Lt. John Ellis from Missouri; Engineer Lt. Bernard "Bunny" Black from New York; Ground Crewman Cpl. Lindsey Decker from Iowa; Radioman Sgt. George "Sparks" Avon from New York; Gunner Sgt. Corbett Carnegie from New York.

On January 9, 1945, Lt. Robert Phillips from Tennessee was the substitute Co-pilot, replacing Lt. Jack Vetters for the mission, so Vetters was the only flight crew member pictured to survive the war.

You may have seen a similar photo with the crew duplicating the pose of their nose art caricatures. [Here is the original version](http://i.imgur.com/iOsnfUW.jpg) of that photo and [here is a colorized version.](http://i.imgur.com/I6DRHHv.jpg) </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I can tell a draft animal can pull a load of about what it weighs for a short distance and the pulling load of a sled on snow is about half of what the weight is.

From the 1850s when a city ordinance required the operators of the [West Side Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Line_(NYCRR\)) to employ a person to precede the trains on horseback, to give the necessary warning in a suitable manner on their approach, until 1941 a ["Tenth Avenue Cowboy"](http://www.livinthehighline.com/the-original-urban-cowboy/) waved a red flag by day and a red lantern by night. I can't see his flag but you can see him in the middle of the bottom left quadrant of the posted photo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The Library of Congress says](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2009632339/) this was August 20, 1959 and they were at the Arkansas state capitol in Little Rock protesting the admission of the ["Little Rock Nine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Nine) to Central High School.

In 1957 the integration had initially been blocked when Governor Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to support the segregationists.  The nine were eventually admitted to Little Rock Central High under the protection of the US Army's 101st Airborne Division, but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse by many of the white students. In 1958 Faubus ordered the closure of all four public high schools, preventing both black and white students from attending school. On August 12, 1959 after moderate school board members were elected the schools were reopened and the black students returned.

<TEXT> You are easily impressed. Those are 1 megapixel jpegs. The original photos were shot with a hand-held 35mm camera using Kodak Tri-X film. The equivalent digital resolution that film and camera setup was capable of is debatable but is probably in the neighborhood of 5 megapixels. At that time, with the right camera, film and lighting, you could get probably get photos equivalent to about 50 megapixels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The price is calculated exactly and then rounded up just like when fractional sales tax is added to your total on retail products. If you bought exactly 1 gallon the total would be 33 cents and if you bought 10 gallons the total would be $3.29.
