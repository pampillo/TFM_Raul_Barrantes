<TEXT> But their reports were wrong. Hamas never accepted a state based on the 67' borders. What they said is that a state based in 67' borders was a "national consensus". Then many news outlets, not all of course, reported as if they accepted the 67's borders. And that's is simply not true.

The supplementary charter unveiled by Hamas last week says a Palestinian state based on pre-1967 lines with Jerusalem as its capital is a "formula for a national consensus," but "rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea."

<TEXT> Good interview. Even better considering that it is from Al Jazeera. Bernie handed it pretty good. It is great that Bernie is coming against the blatant anti-Israel agenda at the UN. Just look at the UN resolutions in 2016. [UN adopted 20 resolutions against Israel and just 3 to the rest of the word, combined. ](https://www.unwatch.org/unga-adopts-20-resolutions-israel-4-rest-world-combined/)

But Bernie should have clarified better why he is against BDS. He should have said that [BDS actually hurts the palestians more and it's completely counterproductive.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriesheffield/2015/02/22/boycott-israel-movement-stunts-the-palestinian-economy/#6726043d1648) 

**In 2012, Palestinian sales to Israel accounted for about 81% of Palestinian export**s and less than a percentage point of Israeli GDP. Palestinian purchases from Israel were two-thirds of total Palestinian imports (or 27% of Palestinian GDP).

Despite overheated BDS rhetoric about exploitation, last year the Palestinian Authoritys official newspaper hailed working conditions for Palestinians employed by Israelis in West Bank settlements. It also scolded Palestinians hiring other Palestinians for low wages with no benefits.

<TEXT> This is not true.

There where 67 Israeli soldiers killed and 469 wounded.

And the reason why the civilian count was so high is because  many werent oficially part of Hamas, but they still were considered as civilians figthers. Ad Hamas placed bombs and missiles from densily populated areas like schools and hospitals. The UN denounced all of this.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay accused Hamas militants of violating international humanitarian law by "locating rockets within schools and hospitals, or even launching these rockets from densely populated areas."[359] The European Union condemned Hamas, and in particular condemned "calls on the civilian population of Gaza to provide themselves as human shields."[400][401] Confirmation of this practice was produced by correspondents from France24, The Financial Times, and RT, who respectively filmed a rocket launch pad which was placed in a civilian area next to a hotel where international journalists were staying,[402] reported on rockets being fired from near Al-Shifa Hospital, and reported on Hamas firing rockets near a hotel.[403] In September 2014, a Hamas official acknowledged to an Associated Press reporter that the group had fired rockets from civilian areas.[404]

<TEXT> From the comments:

On the whole a great video. But you missed some very crucial and important facts.

 You forgot the Transjordan part of the map that WAS included in the land allocation and that many Arabs sold land to Jews before a state was set up.

 You also forgot to mention that Jordan's Occupation of Jerusalem didnt allow any Jews to live in Jerusalem.

 You also forgot to mention the Palestinians have to date had 5 chances to have their own state and declined while the Israelis have always wanted to live in peace and more recently welcomed the two state solution.

 You also forgot to mention what Jordanian army and occupiers did to the holy Jewish sites, graves and synagogues, churches and holy Christian sites. 

 You also forgot to mention that when Israel reoccupied Jerusalem in 67 they wanted to unify it and allowed all people of all faiths to practice and worship there. This still is applied today

 You also forgot to mention that the Palestinians were not just Arabs and many of the Jews and Muslims and Christians who lived there were Palestinian. The currency was the Palestinian pound and Jordanian Dinar. They also had a British flag, Egyptian flag and a Jordanian flag based on the occupiers.

 You forgot to mention that the many of Arabs who lived in Palestine were not originally from Palestine but neighbouring Arab states or original occupiers.

 You forgot to mention the Arab countries view on the PLO, Arafat and the acts of terrorism in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan resulting in the Shatilla massacre of hundreds of Palestinians from the Lebanese Christian phalangists 

 You also forgot to mention the flourishment of the Muslims and Christians who lived under Zionism/Israel and still are living longer, and have an increasing population in their territories.

 You also forgot to mention that many Palestinians in 1948 left due to advice, pressure and a promise that they could come back after the likes of Jordan, Syria and Egypts leaders waged the war and cleansed the land of Jews. The exact number of Jews forced out, killed and had property stolen from Arab land was around 850,000 and is known as the Jewish Nakba. 

 You forgot to mention many Palestinians who didnt leave of their own accord stayed to fight alongside the Jews and the Jews asked them NOT to leave in 1948. Many who did stay now number over 1,000,000 and are integrated into mainstream society and have the same freedoms as Jews.

 You forgot to mention that the west bank is shared jurisdiction. With Israel not allowing access to many roads or areas and enforcing unfair blockades and checkpoints. 

 You also forgot to mention what Israel does to minimise civilian deaths and what Hamas does to maximise it.

 You also forgot to mention why the security wall and checkpoints were a necessity when the Palestinian government failed to stop or condemn Palestinians running into Israel and murdering its citizens with bombs, shootings and stabbings. Since then there have been no suicide bombings as security had to be increased because of this. (it makes it very difficult for Palestinians to travel freely into Israel but the failure is not on Israels side) the economy of the west bank has been hit by this

 You forgot to mention Egypts part on the blockade (entry, flight and sea) and this is because Hamas is designated as a terrorist organisation and has so far shown no interest in working with Israel or Egypt. The unemployment rate cant be solely blamed on Israel or Egypt when Hamas controls all money in and out of Gaza, doesnt build infrastructure or factories for people to work in. Has no sustainable healthcare and doesnt distribute its wealth it gets from donations and fraud. Hamas has created one big concentration camp within the blockade where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer

 You also forgot to mention that more and more Palestinians are getting disillusioned by Hamas and want peace with the Israelis and more and more over the years have moved into Israel and studies show the nearly 2 million Muslims/Palestinians within Israel wouldn't live anywhere else.

 You forgot to mention the Palestinians that work in Israel from the west bank or Gaza numbering around 100,000 are paid and given the same benefits as any Israeli citizen and require this work as Hamas has failed to build a sustainable economy or allow Israelis to travel there freely.

 You forgot to mention that many Israelis are NOT apathetic and do more to encourage peace, build bridges, promote solidarity and coexistence than any of the Palestinians or the Arab countries. 

 You also forgot to mention the lack of the Palestinian peace attempts or their lack of acknowledgement of Israel even in its 1967 borders.

 You also forgot to mention the treatment and lack of rights of Palestinians in Arab countries and the treatment of them over the last 60 years </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a world where it is justified to make 20 resolution and only 2 against syria where there are over 400,000 deaths and over 1 million displaced in just 6 years. This is 10 times more than the entire Israeli-arab conflict and this is a 70 years old conflict. 

There isn't justification or any reason to consider giving 20 anti-Israel resolution while just giving 1 to North Korea, a country that literally has concentration camps and people are facing almost famine. 

Sure, I'm not saying that they can't make resolution against Israel but they need to do it proportionally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because is completely arbitrary,  unjustified, biased, and doesn't make any sense.

How is it possible that Israel receives 20 resolution while the Syria civil war only 3 when it has caused over 400,000 deaths and over a million displaced in just 6 years? This is like 10 times more than the entire Israel-arab conflict that has lasted for 70 years. 

Or North Korea? A country that has literal concentration camp and the population is facing famine.

<TEXT>  Everyone knows Israel is an apartheid regime except the U.S.

No, this is not true. The only people that believes that are people that doesn't know anything about Israel's policies or doens't know what apartheid is.  

[Head of the ICRC delegation to Israel and the Palestinian: Israel Not an Apartheid State ](https://www.algemeiner.com/2017/04/26/red-cross-official-israel-not-an-apartheid-state/)

Similarly, in 2004, Jean-Christophe Rufin, former vice-president of Mdecins Sans Frontires and president of Action Against Hunger, recommended in a report about anti-Semitism commissioned by French Interior Minister Dominique de Villepin[286] that charges of apartheid and racism against Israel be criminalized in France, to the extent they're unjustified.[287][288][289] He wrote that the "perverse" and "defamatory" use of the charge of racism against the very people who were victims of racism "to an unparalleled degree" should be penalized. In his view, the accusations of racism, of apartheid, of Nazism carry grave moral implications and can put in danger the lives of French Jewish citizens.

South African academics Julia I. Bertelsmann and Rhoda Kadalie disagree with the analogy, and believe it is motivated by politics. They say that Israel has been ranked "free" consistently in Freedom House's Freedom in the World rankings, unlike South Africa was during apartheid.[272][318]

The decision was another sign of a hardening of Palestinian Authority policy towards its Hamas rivals, who control the enclave.

Generally doesn't mean always. 

The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. I know that might take a while for you to understand, so consider this my goodbye.

Read the text again.

Jerusalem city is the capital of Palestine, it has its religious, historical and civilian place in an Arab, Islamic and human way, and all its Islamic and Christian holy places headed by Al Aqsa mosque is a non-negotiable right for Palestine, Arab and the Islamic nations. We do not surrender it or give any part of it, and all the occupations procedures in Jerusalem such as Judaization, settlement of the city as well as the forgery of the truth, are illegal.

To claim  "Judaization" is nonsense. Because there is a Jewish connection. The context obviously implies that they reject any Jewish tie to Jerusalem.

Or enforcing embargoes of Gaza. 

Even Abbas and Egypt agrees with the "embargo".

Or keeping them in a perpetual apartheid state inside Israel.

This is nonsense.

But no, as Netanyahu said, it's all their fault for paying terrorists.

That's right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think they meant to say that the UN made documents about it, not that the UN was talking at the time (As you say the UN was established in 1945).

The unsealed United Nations files show that the US, UK and Russia knew as early as December 1942 that two million Jews had been massacred and millions more were at risk of being killed, Britains Independent newspaper reported on Tuesday.

There are other proofs that the Allies knew the extent of the Holocaust already in 1942. For example, the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial states in a report to the UN that During 1942, reports of a Nazi plan to murder all the Jews  including details on methods, numbers, and locations  reached Allied and neutral leaders from many sources.

<TEXT>  And in that case, Israel has not challenged the ruling.

Because Israel can't. 

Again, Israeli law doesn't apply on the palestinian territories and the palestinians make their own law.


Incidentally, for all the reports of that incident, I can't find any follow up on what happened. Can you?

What follow up do you want? Those guys are dead. What do you want? Resurrection? A zombie uprising?  </TEXT>
