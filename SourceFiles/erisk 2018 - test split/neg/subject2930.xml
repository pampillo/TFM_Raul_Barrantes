<TEXT> 4 skinless, boneless, chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds)
All-purpose flour, for dredging
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
4 ounces prosciutto, thinly sliced
8 ounces crimini or porcini mushrooms, stemmed and halved
1/2 cup sweet Marsala wine
1/2 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley

Directions

Put the chicken breasts side by side on a cutting board and lay a piece of plastic wrap over them; pound with a flat meat mallet, until they are about 1/4-inch thick. Put some flour in a shallow platter and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly.

Heat the oil over medium-high flame in a large skillet. When the oil is nice and hot, dredge both sides of the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess. Slip the cutlets into the pan and fry for 5 minutes on each side until golden, turning once  do this in batches if the pieces don't fit comfortably in the pan. Remove the chicken to a large platter in a single layer to keep warm.

Lower the heat to medium and add the prosciutto to the drippings in the pan, saute for 1 minute to render out some of the fat. Now, add the mushrooms and saute until they are nicely browned and their moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Pour the Marsala in the pan and boil down for a few seconds to cook out the alcohol. Add the chicken stock and simmer for a minute to reduce the sauce slightly. Stir in the butter and return the chicken to the pan; simmer gently for 1 minute to heat the chicken through. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's the most realistic suggestion.  I just recently started eating better.  Nothing extreme just simply watching what I eat and being mindful of how much I consume.  In only 2 1/2 weeks I've lost 10 pounds and feel 100% better.  As the eating part becomes more of habit I'll starting getting back into the gym.  The key is just start simple and stay consistent.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beliefs of Muslims

Islam teaches the importance of both belief and practice; one is insufficient without the other (except for some Sufis). The following six beliefs are those that are commonly held by Muslims, as laid out in the Quran and hadith.


    Belief in the Oneness of God: Muslims believe that God is the creator of all things, and that God is all-powerful and all-knowing. God has no offspring, no race, no gender, no body, and is unaffected by the characteristics of human life.

    Belief in the Angels of God: Muslims believe in angels, unseen beings who worship God and carry out God's orders throughout the universe. The angel Gabriel brought the divine revelation to the prophets.

    Belief in the Books of God: Muslims believe that God revealed holy books or scriptures to a number of God's messengers. These include the Quran (given to Muhammad), the Torah (given to Moses), the Gospel (given to Jesus), the Psalms (given to David), and the Scrolls (given to Abraham). Muslims believe that these earlier scriptures in their original form were divinely revealed, but that only the Quran remains as it was first revealed to the prophet Muhammad.

    Belief in the Prophets or Messengers of God: Muslims believe that God's guidance has been revealed to humankind through specially appointed messengers, or prophets, throughout history, beginning with the first man, Adam, who is considered the first prophet. Twenty-five of these prophets are mentioned by name in the Quran, including Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Muslims believe that Muhammad is the last in this line of prophets, sent for all humankind with the message of Islam.

    Belief in the Day of Judgment: Muslims believe that on the Day of Judgment, humans will be judged for their actions in this life; those who followed God's guidance will be rewarded with paradise; those who rejected God's guidance will be punished with hell.

    Belief in the Divine Decree: This article of faith addresses the question of God's will. It can be expressed as the belief that everything is governed by divine decree, namely that whatever happens in one's life is preordained, and that believers should respond to the good or bad that befalls them with thankfulness or patience. This concept does not negate the concept of "free will;" since humans do not have prior knowledge of God's decree, they do have freedom of choice.



FYI I'm not even Muslim but have many friends that are.  That being said you are free to believe whatever you want.  I just don't appreciate people spreading ignorance on subjects that you do not completely understand.  If you don't understand something it's ok to take the time to either learn about it, you may still end up feeling the same but don't miss some of the major facts.

<TEXT> So I was expecting this to happen to me yesterday when I called to cancel....but I was very surprised as to what happened.

I was able to get a live person within about 1 minute into the call.  The service rep was very nice and asked how she could help me.  I said that I would like to cancel my service.  She then asked me if what the reason was....here is where I learned a little trick comes into play.  I said that I'm moving out of the country.  Service rep then said thats great hope things work out for you.  She did then ask if someone else is moving in that would like to keep the service.  I said that it's an apartment and I'm not sure who is moving in.  After that it was all smooth sailing for me.  She even offered to send me boxes to ship back my equipment , which are arriving tomorrow.  The phone call lasted less then 5 minutes and my service is disconnected.

I know this not typical but I think the big take away here if you canceling just tell them your moving out of the country.  Not much they can do to keep you as a customer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the feedback.  Yeah, I made sure that it's 24 months at the price, no contract.  I have a few friends over there that took care of me so I'm not worried.  I'm just looking forward to a service that is up to date in the decade.  Comcast hasn't change their shitty UI in like 10+ years. </TEXT>
