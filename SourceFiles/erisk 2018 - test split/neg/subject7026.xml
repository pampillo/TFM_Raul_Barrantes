<TEXT> Found this in an article from the New Yorker.

"Scheherazade was included in a collection of stories you recently published in Japan, titled Men Without Women, all of which involve men who are withoutor who losewomen. What inspired you to write this series?"

"What I wish to convey in this collection is, in a word, isolation, and what it means emotionally. Men Without Women is a concrete example of that. The title grabbed me first (of course, Hemingways short-story collection of the same title figured in), and the stories followed. Each story came from the vibrations produced by the title. Why Men Without Women? I dont know. Somehow or other, that title put down roots in my mind, in the same way that a wind-blown seed settles and grows in some field."

There was a building of hallways and tables. Table after table placed inside hallway after hallway as far as the eye could see. Thousands of shit sandwiches on these tables. A drunken Minotaur stumbles and is confused by the sheer amount of these goddamn intoxicating sandwiches. Why so many sandwiches? One was nice. Two was not too bad. But this was just too much. Too many shit sandwiches. One can just never eat ALL the shit sandwiches. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did no one here actually read the letters? I did. Spicy is unfortunately correct on this one. I hate trump as much as the next guy but there is nothing in those letters showing White House blocked Yates. 

Obviously the White House could have just told nunes on the low down to shut down the whole thing if they were worried about yates, but that's just speculation at this point.

<TEXT> Exactly. I look at it like this. If an adult is sitting around all day and watching the Disney channel it would be weird (or should be at least) but because these people are consuming media for kids via a book they feel like it's totally normal. It's literally an immature thing to do. But like everyone says if that's what their into so be it. I'm not going to call them out on it in public or anything. But yeah, I'll silently judge them. Maybe I'm just an asshole though. 

Edit: I feel like I should also say that reading kids books probably isn't any worse than watching reality TV or playing call of duty all the time though. Our culture has become pretty stupid in general.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I was inspecting my climb ups and to my surprise I see what looks like tiny bed bug nymphs crawling around inside. Two of them. Casually walking about the inside wall without any difficulty at all. The wall part, not the bottom. The part they aren't supposed to be able to scale. I feel like maybe they aren't bed bugs but they awfully look like them. If they are they are like brand new babies unfed. Too small to get a decent picture unfortunately. What do you guys think? I feel like maybe they were a bit too energetic to be bb's. There is ciemexa everywhere and I haven't been able to find a live one in months. But I don't know what to think now.

<TITLE> Bed Bug LPT: Time to embrace minimalism! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-30 04:20:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, a little bit of a different post here but a little variety can be nice. So, as my title suggests, if you have BB's, adapting a more minimalist life style is really beneficial. Pretty simply, the less crap you have the less places they can hide. I've thrown out dumpsters worth of stuff I never really needed in the first place and now my place feels cleaner, fresher, and makes me feel better mentally when I'm home. With the help up climb ups, cimexa, and routine inspections I've finally got these bastards on the ropes. 

I also spend about a half hour per day cleaning and or organizing random shit so my place always looks nice. After a very long infestation I haven't found any alive or dead in about a month. Oh, and I also repainted all my walls a nice light color because they were all darker colors so it makes inspections much easier and makes rooms feel bigger and more open. Also, make sure to invest in a good flashlight.. 

I got a bunch of tips on organizing from reading Marie Kondo. She has a bunch of videos on YouTube as well. There is also a pretty good podcast by two guys called the minimalists. 

That's all for now, stay vigilant killers!  </TEXT>

Edit: I got talc baby powder (not cornstarch) at the store and poured it all over my finger and applied it that way, as the store didn't have cotton balls and I couldn't really tell if tissue paper was applying it well. Also put a small puff of cimexa in for good measure. Do you guys think this is ok? Just got a new mattress and frame and don't want to fuck this up.  </TEXT>

I think people are self conscious about listening to audiobooks instead of reading them for whatever reason and that's why they get weird about it, but thats stupid. There's no shame in listening to an audiobook. But I don't get why someone would say they read a book when they actually didn't read anything, it's just a poor choice of words at best, or being disingenuous at worst. No one would go see a Shakespeare play or watch a movie version of a book and then say they read it, just because the original medium was written words.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because people are animals. Literally. So we have always had that carnal capacity for violence. Compound that with as our brains got bigger and we became self aware many people just can't deal with the absurdity of life and not having an answer to ultimate metaphysical questions of what's the point of it all and all that shit. So we made up bullshit divisive religions and bullshit nation states that go back to our basic tribalistic predilections of always being on our guard in our own little groups and having enemies. Also greed and profit motive contributing to extreme inequality doesn't help in modern times. But greed goes all the way back too right? It's the fighting over resources that are limited and the feeling you never have enough to be secure, you have to always keep fighting for survival, this is instinct, even though at this point it may be irrational. 

Humans have good qualities too like empathy and having a "conscious" but ultimately that just goes back to a basic evolutionary understanding that what's good for my group is good for me and basic ideas of reciprocity and whatnot. 

TLDR: Humans are shitty by nature. This probably sounds pretty cynical, so sorry, I maybe drank too much whiskey.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought it was great. Good job OP. 

The other post said the character lacked diffidence (which I had to look up and means - modesty or shyness resulting from a lack of self-confidence) and because of this they couldn't bare it. I disagree. 

This is from Wikipedia - Prufrock laments his physical and intellectual inertia, the lost opportunities in his life and lack of spiritual progress, and he is haunted by reminders of unattained carnal love. With visceral feelings of weariness, regret, embarrassment, longing, emasculation, sexual frustration, a sense of decay, and an awareness of mortality.

I think the film does really capture the spirit of the thing. Again, great job.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If they wanted to give an award for music they should make a music category in my opinion. I guess it comes down to whether or not song lyrics are considered literature, which I think is a stretch. I mean I guess you can say song lyrics are poetry so it's ok, but really.. Just give literature awards to people who write books and poetry, and give music awards to people who make music. 

Also, I like Bob Dylan and all but don't know that I really agree that he reinvented music as some people were saying in the other thread. Folk music has been around for ever and was plenty popular before Dylan came around, he just decided to go electric and turn it into pop rock music, not that that's a bad thing. But still..  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, basically, I'm looking to discuss and find more books that have this common theme. I've been reading Kafka (The Trial and The Castle) lately and just love him and his commentary on absurd bureaucracies and just life in general. I think I'm going to go for Catch 22 by Jospeh Heller next. Also I really liked a book called Satin Island by Tom McCarthy about a ridiculous corporate anthropologist. Camus's The Stranger also fits in here I think too. Also maybe some classic postmodern stuff like the Crying of Lot 49 by Pynchon and White Noise by DeLillo. I want more though! What are some good reads that make you feel the darkly funny absurdity of modern life? Doesn't even have to be humorous, just some good old existential dread is fine sometimes too!

Edit: Also really into all the funny and awkward social interactions between characters in Kafkas short stories!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only read a few of his short stories so far. The mark of the beast and the phantom rickshaw. I really enjoyed both stories. He is definitely a great storyteller. As for the racism thing another user brought up, if you want to read anything written in the 19th century by a white guy, guess what, it's probably going to be a bit racist.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Self publishing a multiple author anthology question. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-28 01:05:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I want to self publish a multiple author short story anthology in the horror genre. Does anyone have any experience with this? I know where to post a call for submissions and all that, but then what? I plan to pay authors a flat amount upon acceptance maybe with Amazon gift cards. I feel that would probably be the easiest.. Also, I plan to use Amazon and create space to publish. I'm an absolute beginner with this so any suggestions would be great. Can I just make up a name like so and so press or whatever? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a dark fiction writer I have to say that the shocking, disturbing, and depressing can be good writing too. Its not all just new writers trying to be edgy, obviously. Just write what's true to yourself and your characters.
