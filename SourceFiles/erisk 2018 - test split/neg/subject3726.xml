<TEXT> Have you seen Michael Haneke's film *The Piano Teacher* (also based on a book - I have not read it!). It stars Isobel Huppert as a deeply narcissistic, self destructive, self harming piano teacher (and of course Huppert made an excellent Madame Bovary too! Narcissism is her speciality I think!). This is perhaps an Anna Karenina, Emma Bovary, Hedda Gabler for our time (? - maybe not!). And yet Haneke finds an element of *hope* at the end of the film. It's barely there, but it *is* there. Hope is possible within such a narrative. The braver artist will surely provide it for us.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry if I misunderstand you, but I'm not remotely worried Flaubert is over my head! It happens that in this novel I feel the writer's presence strongly. Perhaps I'm mistaken, but for me the tone he often strikes is satirical. Satire suggests a wry knowing - the author makes his presence known by winking at us, or maybe in this case he simply raises an eyebrow. Either way, he is 'in the room'. He has targets: as I suggested, romanticism is one, but the arrogance of empiricism is another. As I read, I'm experiencing Flaubert's shots at these targets as something slightly separate from the literal narrative. His opinions on farming and local politics, for example, which I didn't understand but was aware that he was telling me about, are something apart from Emma's romantic intrigues (although of course, for Flaubert the two may stem from the same root). And so, for me, the novel is working on two levels. This is simply what I, the reader, make of the text! Perhaps if I were more gripped by Emma's  plight my mind would not be tempted to wander over to Flaubert and try to figure out what he's getting at! Thanks for your recommendation I will give it a look!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There could be a very basic reason for my feelings on *The Corrections* in that it describes a world (a time) that I recognise, and the past of *Bovary* seems strange. But - Emma's acting for herself? Does she? It seems to me she acts only against herself. Perhaps I understood her too quickly - and now I'm bored! Emma wants desperately to be loved, and yet, for some reason, considers herself utterly unacceptable - an abject creature that should have no place in the world. Therefore when adoring, unconditional love is offered to her simply and openly (from Charles) it is immediately dismissed. After all, whoever offered it must surely be intensely stupid, or otherwise have such low standards as to be as detestable as Emma is herself. And so she focusses her attention on seeking love from men who view her as worthless - although all she really wants from them is rejection. Rejection will re-affirm Emma's self loathing, and self loathing is her comfort zone and also the home of her great pride. I haven't finished to book, but I know that Emma commits suicide in the end. I don't know if I want to finish the journey. Where is the hope for God's sake? It's too sad and also cruel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah - but you see I can't see Emma as a victim. She's lazy - she doesn't try. Emma sits back and waits for the world to make her happy. It's such a basic error, and obviously a widespread and common one. Of course! I know something about this error myself - enough to know that it's entirely self inflicted. But there are ways out of this self imposed prison. Emma doesn't *want* to help herself out, and I find that tiresome. In fact as I write this I'm starting to realise I hate Emma! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your comment! It's interesting to me that the passages you recall to clearly are from the first section of the book, before the Bovary's move to Yonville. I hope you don't mind if I cut and paste my own reply to another comment:

The first section of the book, before the Bovary's move to the town where the main action is set, I enjoyed very much. Perhaps this was simply for, as you put it, the narrative voice. The descriptions of Charles and Emma's upbringing, their courtship, wedding, the grand ball that becomes some kind of touchstone for Emma's ambition. I wonder though, if with the move to Yonville the tone shifts slightly, adopting a kind of bitter cynicism. I feel sometimes as if Flaubert is using the setting, characters and action, to get some things off his chest. He rants against everything - against romanticism of course, but also against rational enlightened ideas that look to science to answer all of life's mysteries. Ambition - love - all is vanity. Does Flaubert simply loathe the world?

Of course this makes me think of the translation too. To enjoy writing in the way you describe, the translation is surely everything. I'm reading the Lydia Davis version. Is there an alternative you would recommend?

<TEXT> Well that's a very interesting question isn't it! Hmmmmm.... perhaps it's not so much that I have to 'like' them, and more that I have to be attracted to them. This could be because they're open hearted and courageous - but it could equally be because they're terribly badly behaved or even evil! I guess I'm not attracted to Emma. I've thought about why this might be, but I can't find an answer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How strange you should mention *The Corrections*. I don't read that many books, but this was the one I read before starting *Madame Bovary*! I had no trouble connecting with Franzen's characters. Deeply flawed and often selfish as they were, I recognised them as intensely human. Maybe this is what I'm missing with Emma - her humanity. About half way through the book it started to bother me that she has no friends. No friends - at all! Of course this could be circumstance - maybe there are simply none available to her. But I find this unlikely. It makes Emma strange to me. It frustrates me a little that Flaubert will mention that Emma spent some time chatting to the servants - and I think I recall a passage where she receives female visitors from the town. But we learn nothing about the nature of these conversations. I can't help feeling it's in ordinary social situations like these an the human aspect of Emma may be found - but it's denied us.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Madame Bovary is confusing me. How should I be reading this book? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello - I'll try and keep this short as it's my first post here and you never know if you're going to get taken down for not reading the rules properly. 

Madame Bovary - about three quarters of the way through this classic novel and struggling. Problem I'm having is that I just don't *like* anybody, and I get the feeling Flaubert doesn't like them very much either. Emma is a narcissistic nightmare, her husband's an idiot, the neighbour is a pompous prat, the first lover a cad and the second just annoying. This reads like a satire - and it's hard to connect emotionally with satire. This is why satire is so often funny. Madame Bovary, however, while containing comic undertones, is far from comedy. I would describe it as a satirical romantic tragedy, and that's pretty confusing to me if I'm honest. My question is - why am I failing to connect with this story and these characters? I don't understand *how* I'm supposed to be reading this book. Should I be moved? Amused? Should I judge the characters for their failings? Confused. 

Edit: Thank you for all the insightful and helpful comments! I return to Madame Bovary with a refreshed enthusiasm! Very useful indeed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I agree with you also. This is why I said 'for the time being at least'. You are right - the ending of *Taxi Driver* is ambiguous. We don't really know what the future is going to be like for Travis. There's an unreal quality to the ending too. As you point out, we only see Betsy in the mirror. Is she even there? We can't be sure. IMO *Taxi Driver* is one of the greatest films of the 20th century. Multiple, sometimes contradictory interpretations can sit together and all contain some truth. This is a defining feature of great art! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I would say he does change, most obviously at the end of the film. We can see how much he has changed when we compare his reaction to Betsy at the start of the film to the end when she gets into his taxi. Through his extreme action Travis has, for the time being at least, found a way out of his depression and social isolation. He seems, relatively speaking, to have become a normally functioning human being. He changes too in other ways prior to this, i.e. from a lost and desperate alienated loser to a vigilante social crusader with definite goals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nobody I can think of has the combination of intellectual rigour, emotional distance, and flamboyant theatricality that for me characterises Kubrick. People quite often compare PTA to Kubrick, but I don't get it. Theatricality, yes, but Anderson's heart is often placed firmly on his sleeve and intellectually he is happy to remain relatively abstract, where Kubrick liked to keep his thesis clear. I might suggest Michael Haneke as a better comparison. The coldness is there for sure, but also the discipline and a good dose of flair.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw this film years ago but still remember it pretty well - something I would attribute to more than simple shock factor. Having said that, I also remember Breillat's previous film, *Romance*, which I'm pretty sure I remember only for its shock factor. In my opinion *Fat Girl* is by far the superior film. 

I've always been curious about the title change for its English language release. The original French title, *A Ma Soeur!* (To My Sister!), contextualises the narrative in a radically different way to the confrontational 'Fat Girl'. It almost becomes a different film. I wonder why this decision was taken? Simply to create controversy?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This post made me laugh! I also find the treatment of Lina in the movie to be excessively cruel. I find the ending where she is 'exposed' uncomfortable viewing. I also agree with you about the speech instructor scene. I have always felt sorry for him - the two male stars are basically assholes. 'Make Em Laugh' is my least favourite scene in the movie - it's the unfunniest thing I've ever seen. Forced entertainment indeed. 

I would go further with your take on Kelly's character in that I also find his treatment of Reynolds throughout the film questionable. He makes her feel extremely uncomfortable in some scenes, and is persistant to the point of insensitivity. His stunt at the end could potentially have been deeply humiliating for both women. He's basically a bully. This is mirrored by Kelly's reported treatment of Reynolds during her training for *Singin In The Rain*, when Reynolds was put through some sort of punishing dance boot camp by Kelly which left her a physical and emotional wreck (although Reynolds later spoke of this as a positive experience). Reynolds was 18 - I believe Kelly was 40 at the time. Kelly was a brilliantly tallented performer and an extraordinary dancer. But from a modern perspective there's something dislikable about his character in his films. I'm not sure how sincere I ever find him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's funny - I completely agree with your take on *Drive* but I hated the film for exactly the reasons you love it. I hadn't actually thought of the film as deconstructing the male fantasy in the way you suggest - but I'm convinced by it and maybe will give it another view at some point with this in mind. I found Gosling's character to be, as you suggest, an incredibly creepy weirdo, and the idea that any woman would not run a million miles away from him as fast as they could was, for me, completely ridiculous. This is the kind of guy who practices karate moves in front of his bedroom mirror. Was this the ultimate man's fantasy, or the ultimate boy's fantasy?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it's for the long meal scenes, as I recall *Van Gogh* is particularly striking. *A Nos Amours* is generally regarded as Pialat's masterpiece though - although IMO he made several masterpieces.

<TEXT> This immediately makes me think of Pialat. He has a crazy technique he uses in *Lola*, *A Nos Amours*, and also *Van Gogh* where towards the end of the film he will introduce a scene that starts normally, keeps going, keeps going..... and then *keeps going* till you assume the editor just gave up. This is after 90 minutes of a movie with pretty regular scene length and structure. The scenes are always set around a dinner table with a group of characters eating, and they ramble and ramble on and on. The effect is tremendously exciting - he's so audacious. He's disrupting the structure of the film, and completely confounding the viewer's expectations. We're forced to abandon our grip on the narrative somewhat, and therefore Pialat invites us to live with the characters in the moment - we have no choice! It sends shivers down my spine. I realise I've kind of spoilt this for anyone who hasn't seen these films. Sorry about that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer: I am not American - brownies are not part of my culture, so please excuse any brownie ignorance or plain lack of taste in the brownie department that may offend. My brownie recipe comes from a *Frenchman*. 

Hi everyone. I love brownies and found a recipe (on youtube of all places) that is just to my taste (for me, perfect cakey gooey-ness without becoming sickly). It bothers me, however, that there is no solid chocolate included. It's just cocoa. I love the texture, but want more chocolate depth. Basically the recipe calls for a sugar/ground nut/flour (very little)/cocoa powder/butter mix, to which you add egg whites and an alarming amount of browned butter. You then beat the mixture for a good while to get air into it, and then add toasted nuts. I'd like to try melting some solid chocolate into the melted butter and see how things go. The texture of the brownies is very much to my liking, so I don't want to mess with that. What would you guys do?

Edit: The video I took the recipe from is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojU1TqDXl2U) if anyone is interested.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely agree with you. Thing is, because Lynch makes films that are just so insanely fruitloops, you can sometimes end up questioning the film's worth, because if pretty much *anything* can happen at *any* time, where's the artistry in that? Surely the artistry in film lies in communicating something sensible to an audience - telling a coherent story? I think this is what some detractors would argue. But they understimate the skill required to create crazy worlds and still make them believable - to take an audience on such a mad ride and keep them engaged to the very end. The narrative *has* to be making some kind of sense on some subtle level - maybe an abstract level. IMO Lynch is a great artist, and to take a rational approach to his films is like taking a rational approach to a piece of music.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't think of a better example of what you describe than Federico Fellini. After *8 1/2* it's like even he couldn't see past the 'Fellini-esque' tag - it's a kind of creative curse. When a director starts to put his own name before the title of his films  - 'Fellini's Casanova' - 'Fellini Satyricon' - it's a bad bad sign. It's just popped into my head that Fellini's friend Ingmar Bergman somehow managed largely to avoid this problem, despite having his own 'Bergman-esque' tag and a highly distinctive film making style. *Fanny And Alexander*, made at the end of Bergman's career, is right up there with his best work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can anyone help me troublshoot my croissants? 

This is one of those situations where there is so much contradictory advice out there I no longer know up from down! My journey to the croissants of my dreams is well on its way now, but I'm having trouble with the final proving. My rise is lacklustre to say the least. 

I think it's a yeast problem. I'm using instant yeast, but on doing some research online I've found a number of sources warning against using instant yeast in dough that spends time in the refridgerator. A few manufacturer's own websites carry this warning. Meanwhile a number of croissant recipes from big names (eg Paul Hollywood) include instant yeast without any mention of a potential problem. 

Does anyone have any comments on this? For dough that needs chilled, is there a problem with instant yeast, or in your experience does instant yeast work fine? 

PS - if anyone wants to make a comment on the whole 'to knead or not to knead' debate that would be appreciated too.  </TEXT>

Obviously the technology is not advanced by today's standards, but the sheer creativity of the ending manages to successfully communicate the overwhelming nature of such a transcendental experience. I would also suggest *Magnolia* and the rain of frogs. Through his camera work, writing and editing, Anderson creates a suitably monumental climax.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> By chance I happen to have seen *The Cabinet Of Doctor Caligari* for the first time just yesterday! It greatly impressed me how many standard horror movie narrative devices and sequences are contained within this film from 1920. The exploitation of the uncanny - the monster at the window - the device of setting up a 'red herring' murderer who is caught by the police - the unreliable narrator - there was so much there that must surely have been a huge influence on later cinema. In fact to say the film was an 'influence' feels like an understatement. It pretty much invents the contemporary horror film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I enjoyed the movie. I think Ford spent quite a lot time creating a sharp contrast between a sanitised, glossy and immaculate world of style, fashion and art galeries, and a dirty, messy world of human passions and suffering. The two worlds clashed most obviously in the many art works included in the film - housed in perfectly manicured interiors, but always depicting violent and chaotic emotions. Edward's novel is another example of such an art work. I would suggest that Edward has written a great novel, and that he was only able to do this as a direct result of the terrible emotional suffering Susan has caused him. Because of her, his comfortable city life fell apart and he was dragged down into the emotional dirt. He knows this, and while he may on one level be filled with a desire for revenge, on another he is grateful. Through his actions he finds a way to express both of these contradictory feelings towards Susan. So he gets his revenge, yes, but at the same time in dragging Susan down into a world of suffering he means to save her from her life and her world - a world she feels increasingly detached from and depressed by. Susan is searching for meaning, and Edward gives this to her. At the very last moment of the movie we see Susan's eyes and we know she suddenly understands what Edward has done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Em... well Toby Maguire just popped into my head I guess, but i suppose I was thinking of his performance in something like *Ride With The Devil*. If you want a really interesting example of the impact an actor can have on getting the audience on side, I would recommend watching (if you haven't already seen it) Haneke's *The Piano Teacher*. Isobel Huppert plays what should be an intensely dislikable character. She's destructive, mean spirited, narcissistic, and pathetic. And yet we are absolutely desperate for her to find a way out of her misery. The German actor Bruno Ganz is another good example. In *Wings Of Desire* or *Eternity And A Day* he delivers performances so underplayed it really is as if he's simply turned up and stood in front of the camera doing nothing. But we are on his side. I actually find the whole thing quite mysterious.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well it's interesting you ask that, because the whole salting business is something I find really confusing. In this case I feel the salting *did* affect the texture of the final dish. Although the pork was delicious, I did wonder if the texture would have been better without the salting. Flavour-wise the salt worked well - as did the fennel seeds I added with the salt. I was surprised by how much of the fennel flavour had penetrated the meat. Although many recipes recommend the salting for confit, next time I will try the dish with much less, or even without the long salting beforehand and see what the results are. I'd make a post about it but I imagine it would be immediately withdrawn by the mods for being 'too general' (happens to me about once a week). Maybe someone with expertise in this area will read our comments and respond.....? :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This might not be the kind of answer you're looking for, but I think a lot of this is down to casting. Good film actors (or at least those that tend to play sympathetic roles) have an ability to get the audience on side immediately, just by showing up and standing in front of the camera. I'm trying to think of the best example I can..... maybe someone like Toby Maguire? (Now a bunch of people are going to tell me how much they hate Toby Maguire!). Other actors have some particularly strong aspects to their character that make them people you immediately want to invest in. Jack Nicholson, for example, has this. Even when he's playing some crazy murderer, the audience *needs* to follow his story. At the risk of upsetting people, I would suggest someone like Leonardo Dicaprio is an example of an actor who doesn't really possess this quality, despite being a leading movie star. My point is that it's not a given for every successful actor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just personally speaking, la la land might have worked better for me if the dream world had been contrasted with an impression of the real environment of LA. The opening is a good example of what I mean. A song and dance number bursting out of a traffic jam is a fun idea, but I didn't really believe the traffic jam to start with. I don't know why exactly, but nothing at all seemed real in this movie. Thinking back, the only location I can remember that felt like it might have a connection to a real world was Gosling's apartment at the beginning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well - it's a little too late for me to change my plans this much now! Maybe I will try your method next time. I'm not sure about confit being a marketing ploy - as I understand it the technique is really very traditional - unlike sous-vide which is relatively new (I don't know very much about this - please someone correct me!). Anyway I gather from reading a few online articles the techniques amount to pretty much the same thing. I've read that experiments have been done using water instead of fat to confit, and the results were exactly the same. It's all poaching! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pork belly confit overnight?? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-23 21:18:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello. I'm about to attempt to confit a piece of pork belly (about 1.5 kg/ 3.3 lb - bone in) in pork fat. I've had the pork in a dish with salt for 24 hrs, washed the salt off, and now it's dry. The best looking recipe I can find online instructs to confit the pork in a low oven (150 C/ 300 f) for three hours. After a conversation I had with my butcher about 3 day confit duck, I'd really like to try the pork overnight at a lower temperature. I often roast a small joint of meat very low (75 C/ 170 f) for hours till the internal temperature is 'safe' (a brilliant way to roast any small joint). My plan is to try the pork in the pork fat at 75 C and leave overnight - so it would be in there for 7 hours or so. Can anyone tell me why this is a crazy plan?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *La La Land* puts a fair proportion of its energies into creating a dreamlike fantasy version of Los Angeles - a 'city of stars' where anything is possible and dreams can come true. In a way it's attempting to steal the 'city of dreams' identity from New York, traditionally the cultural focus for 'dreams can come true' movie narratives, from the Follies of the 30s to *New York New York* and *Fame*. 

*Rebel Without A Cause* is significant in that it was one of the first popular movies to focus on the social problems of Los Angeles - to 'expose' the real disfunctional undertones of the city that houses the superficial glamour of Hollywood. Since then movies that have been set in LA and in and around Hollywood have tended to follow this 'expose the underbelly' pattern, from *Sunset Boulevard* through *Day Of The Locust* and *The Player* all the way to the recent *Inherent Vice* (and incuding films that focus on LA gang conflict such as *Boyz N The Hood*, which are direct descendents of *Rebel Without A Cause*). 

Chazelle wants us to forget about all that - to forget this popular LA mythology ever existed. And so Mia and Sebastian choose to see *Rebel Without A Cause* - but Chazelle keeps first us, and then them from really taking the film in in any significant way. Mia first stands in front of the screen, obliterating it from our view, and then the film burns out, preventing the characters from seeing it out to its depressing conclusion. Chazelle includes *Rebel Without A Cause*, and then does everything he can to obliterate it. 

What does Chazelle *not* want us to see? *Rebel* ends with the murder of a young man on the steps of the observatory - a sad wasteful event born of street violence - an early example of an event that is a fairly regular occurance on the streets of LA even today. When the police cars have gone, a man in a suit casually walks across the scene, a 'respectable' middle class gent, comletely oblivious to the murder the location has just witnessed. The message is *this is happening around us, we just don't see it*. Mia and Sebastian may idolise James Dean as a glossy movie icon, but within the rhetoric of *La La Land*, the lovers function in every way in the manner of that respectable gent casually walking by the observatory steps. In fact they take his purpose several steps further - gleefully singing and dancing on the grave of *Rebel*'s troubled young hoodlum, just as *La La Land* itself dances on the graves of all the victims of social deprivation, the addicts, the drop outs, the porn stars and the hookers that people a city that has more commonly been presented to us a global heart of darkness. Nice. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Devil's Food Cake - should I tinker? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm making a birthday cake for a party this coming weekend, and have settled on a Devil's Food Cake. I'm following Margaret Costa's recipe from the classic *Four Seasons* cook book. 

The ingredients (sorry this is in metric):
280g brown sugar/ 175g butter/ 3 eggs/ 85g plain chocolate melted in 150ml water/ 280g flour (+ rising agents)/ 150ml soured cream/ vanilla extract. 
The method is standard for a cake batter, with the ingredients added in the order given. 

First trial with this cake is a success. The texture of the sponge especially is superb - beautifully light and moist. My only criticism is the flavour. It's a touch on the bland side. I feel like it needs something - cocoa powder maybe to boost the chocolate. Is it safe to add cocoa (or anything else good that would up the flavour of the sponge) and not risk sacrificing texture? I'm not experienced with this old fashioned type of cake- is it simply the case that this type of sponge is best seen as a base for delicious icing (frosting)? Thoughts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I made kidney bean with chorizo and blood sausage following the method given by Patricia Wells in *Bistro Cooking*. It was OK, but I struggled to get the kidney beans to cook. It took about five hours (luckily I was making the dish well in advance!)

Wells instructs us to pour boiling water over dried kidney beans and soak for one hour, then to drain and simmer the beans in stock (wine) for two hours or more. I followed this (I very rarely use kidney beans so I don't have my own preferred method) and found the instructions gave nowhere near the amount of time I needed to get the beans to a pleasant eating tenderness. I fished the packet out of the bin and noticed the instructions advised soaking the beans over night (this is what I always do with chickpeas). Curious, I looked up some similar recipes and found alarmingly different methods - all the way from 24 hour soaking to one recipe which advised adding the *unsoaked* dried beans to the stew and *simmering for an hour*! Anyone fancy **hospitalisation** for dessert?

Can anyone shed some light on this dried kidney bean anomaly?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember liking this film a lot. Ozon is a highly skilled director - what I admire is his refusal to give the audience what they expected. He keeps us curious right up to the last minute, often pulling back from drama - so difficult situations are sometimes resolved easily (or rather the resolution occurs almost imperceptibly with the passage of time), while elsewhere crisis appears as if from nowhere. It's all a tricky balancing act Ozon has become wonderfully adept at. I'm not sure I agree with you that the Vacth character is a 'typical person in extraordinary circumstances'. To me she might just as easily by an extraordinary person in typical circumstances.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes you are absolutely on to something with your ideas about Strangelove. The character was based (in part) on Henry Kissinger, who was born in Germany. Kissinger was actually a jew who fled Germany to escape the Nazis, but as a very broad satire, *Strangelove* takes great liberties with the inspirations for its characters. I believe many details of the characterisation came from Sellers himself, and so were borne of an ingenious comedic instinct rather than carefully considered subtext. Still, it's interesting to look into Kissinger and his controvertial political career as it will give you further insight into *Strangelove* in general. 

Edit: seems like I'm wrong about the Kissinger link- see discussion bellow.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not 100% sure, but I don't *think* 17 was underage in New York in the 1970s (?). It's a technicality, but a significant one. Also, as far as I understand it, Allen has never been convicted of any abuse of children, and the allegations brought against him were all dismissed. I think you have to take these things into account when making your own judgements in this case. Having said that, I do find Allen's relationships with much younger women in some of his films 'icky'. *Manhattan* isn't really one of them though. In the 1970s there was an entirely different attitude to the sexuality of 'just legal' teens. There was something intensely sophisticated about the older man/teenage girl pairing - perhaps influenced by a European attitude to such matters, which still exists in some form today. I'm not sure I would support particularly singling out Allen in the respect - it seems unfair. You would need to start questioning the films of Roman Polanski and Maurice Pialat - and those two are just off the top of my head, I'm sure there are many many more. But of course, make your own judgement here, because each of us should. I struggle with the films of Klaus Kinski today for the very same reasons. I can't unknow what we now know about his treatment of his daughters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Toni Erdmann** (Maren Ade, 2016 - up for Best Foreign Film Oscar) - very disappointed with this German odd-couple (Father/Daughter) comedy, after hearing a beyond glowing review on the radio. Structurally it's a fairly standard clash-of-personalities-learn-something-from-each-other narrative, with the gentle slacker practical joker Father showing his work obsessed daughter there's more to life than getting the contracts - kind of in the mode of *Pretty Woman*, except the asked-for prostitute is now an unasked-for parent. 

It never feels nice to single out an actor for criticism, but in this case I felt strongly the reason the otherwise quirky and potentially funny action failed to land with me was the Father, played by Peter Simonischeck. I simply failed to connect to this character, despite several obvious signals from the director that I was supposed to be strongly empathising with the rather pathetic but warm hearted joker. The actress playing the daughter, Sandra Huller, was, on the other hand, fantastic. At one point the Father asks 'are you human?' after witnessing his daughter in action at work. Ironically, I was thinking just the same thing about *him*. Huller so successfully communicates a vivid inner life, it is she that often ends up looking like the 'human' one of the pair. This imbalance jumped out at me from the off and for me the movie never manages to escape it.  </TEXT>

For me, there simply is nothing in American cinema that can compete with Pialat - with Varda or Dumont. I get my Weerasethakul fix from Weerasethakul - I don't need Hollywood to provide that for me. If you really want to challenge yourself, why not try some cinema that Hollywood does better than anywhere else? I mean have you seen *Die Hard* (1988)?. I am not being facetious. *Die Hard* is a masterpiece of its kind (I do not joke) - and could only have been made in America. If you haven't seen it, watch *Die Hard*, and if you are unable to appreciate this film, well then I would probably accept that you will never really appreciate the very best that American cinema has to offer! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello everybody
I have a question to you all about using wine in cooking. 
For a while now (at least this is true here in the UK) the orthodoxy that has been drummed into us is: *only cook with wine that you would drink*. Now, I enjoy using wine in cooking and do so often - especially now when it's cold outside. But the thing is - the wine we drink is *expensive* - honestly, at between 8 to 10 a bottle, it makes for really very extravagant stock! In addition, if for example I'm using red wine as a marinade for meat, I'm probably going to chuck a splash of red wine vinegar in there, and this feels terribly wasteful when using a really good bottle of wine. Does anyone else have this problem with wine in cooking? What do you do? Do you always stick to the wine rules? Anyone else dread the humiliation of entering a wine shop and telling them you're looking for 'something to cook with'? The looks I've gotten in the past! </TEXT>

I had a search through this sub and found a link to a brilliant site, www.verbedujour.com, which is a basic learning tool focusing exclusively on verbs. For the moment, I only want to focus on the tenses covered in duolingo. My problem is the various tenses appear to have quite different  names depending where you look. The names given on duolingo are: 

*Past imperfect*

*Compound past*

*Infinitive*

*Pluperfect*

*Gerund*

*Future*

*Imperative*

*Conditional*

*Past conditional*

*Past subjunctive*

The names for the verb tenses in Verbe Du Jour are:

*Prsent*

*Futur*

*Imparfait*

*Pass simple*

*Conditionnel*

*Subjunctif prsent*

*Subjunctif imparfait*

*Participe pass*

*Impratif*

*Participe prsent*

*Axiliaire*

Can anyone match these terms up for me?  Or, can someone tell me which tenses from Verbe Du Jour I should practice in order to cover those included in Duolingo? Some are obvious, but others I'm finding quite confusing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> do you have any recommendations on american humanist filmmakers?

I'm not really sure what you mean by 'humanist' film makers, but these two spring to mind:

Sean Durkin *Martha Marcy May Marlene* (2011)

Abel Ferrara *Bad Lieutenant* (1992)

why does the europeans seem to be more interested in humans, rather than plot?

Well, the vast majority of all films have a plot and very few films are not interested in the human aspect of their narratives. Having said that, a couple of the film makers you mention (Tarr and Costa) would be considered by some to be deeply pretentious. Whether you agree with that or not, you're moving into a style of film that is so far removed from what we think of as 'American' film making, I don't really see the problem in simply admitting that you don't particularly like American films. Generally speaking, I prefer European cinema to films from the US - it's just a matter of personal preference. There are a few directors in America who exist very much on the fringes of the industry you might be interested in. Check out Todd Solondz (just IMO *Palindromes* (2004) is one of his best), and the non-Hollywood films of Gus Van Sant (specifically his trilogy *Elephant*, *Last Days*, and *Paranoid Park*). 

P.S. If you consider a move towards American film as a process of 'de-snobbing' yourself, you *are* a snob! :-)

<TEXT> I appreciate the time and thought that's gone into your interpretation - it's very interesting. To my mind, however, you're imbuing this movie with depth it does not possess!! Chazelle has chosen *Rebel Without A Cause* because it's one of the few iconic films from what can conceivably be thought of as 'old Hollywood' that is *set in L.A.*. Chazelle is attempting to discover a sort of 'cultural heritage' to ground the theme of Los Angeles in his film. Ironically, *Rebel Without A Cause* was also one of the first movies to attempt a gritty, realist portrayal of L.A. street life, far away from the fantasy land of Hollywood *La La Land* celebrates. In this way *Rebel* is the predecessor of films like *Boyz N The Hood*, having very little in common with the Hollywood musical *La La Land* is so nostalgic for. When Stone and Gosling have their romantic night at the Planetarium, are they not just like the businessman who crosses the scene at the very end of *Rebel Without A Cause* - completely oblivious to the problems in the streets around him? It's just one of the *many* inconsistencies that kept me confused throughout this movie!

Hollywood has no culture. Hollywood is a mirror - a cypher for culture from *elsewhere*. That's why films about Hollywood have tended to be cynical or even dystopian - *Sunset Boulevard, The Day Of The Locust, The Player* etc - or else they've taken the fantasy route and buried themselves safely in a glorious past - *Singin' In The Rain* or even 2011's *The Arist*. *La La Land* makes the bold move of setting itself in contemporary Hollywood while maintaining an upbeat, positive *Singin In The Rain* demeanour. This is pretty original - I can't think of another example. For me, however, the experiment fails. Chazelle fails to really pin down a coherent version of Hollywood, drawing a colourful screen over Hollywood's well documented dark side (industry parties where *nobody* is snorting coke??), turning a blind eye to the violence and deprivation just over the fence (did anyone notice a single pair of saggers??), leaving us with.... well - what? Memories? Memories of movies - the vast majority of which were not set in L.A. - not written or directed or acted by people from L.A. - and in fact could have been filmed *anywhere* with the appropriate technical facilities. To add to the confusion, Chazelle proceeds to throw contemporary Jazz into the mix, thereby adding a whole other cultural element of LA that has little to do with Hollywood  - aayyeesh! It's a cultural melting pot indeed - but a confusing and stressful one - and *not* one that contains any resemblance to the cultural melting pot that is contemporary Los Angeles!  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Susan is very shallow.

I did question the casting of Amy Adams in this regard. I think Adams is one of the best of our current crop of Hollywood A-listers - and she seems to be getting better and better with each role - I really rate her very highly. But in this film.... I wonder. Thing is, I *can't not like* her. Of course, if Ford had cast an *un*likable actress the film wouldn't have worked at all. But casting someone as thoroughly likeable as Adams.... I like her so much I think I was *always* on Susan's side!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really interesting observations - thanks. 

Do you think the narrative would have been strengthened by just a *little bit* more information on Susan and Edwards split, and maybe on the impact the nature of the split and the termination had on Edward?

Do you think the ending would have been strengthened by *some* indication, however subtle, that the events of the film had inspired Susan to move on from her crisis? This could be the possibility that she will leave her husband - or even the opposite; a determination to continue with her life as it was before and to once more bury all thoughts of Edward. Or perhaps there might simply have been more of an indication of the choices facing Susan now - a question - what is she going to do now? The final close up of Susan's eye was a stylish ending, but there was a blankness to it I found dissatisfying. It emphasised the idea that Susan has been duped - the ending becomes Edward's in a way, and I think I would rather it belonged to Susan, as it was her character I felt invested in. 

In retrospect, after thinking about this film quite a lot, my biggest criticism of it would be a feeling that Ford is seperating different 'types' of creativity into 'authentic' and 'superficial'. The 'authentic' creativity would be exemplified by Edward's novel - the 'superficial' by slick and commercial contemporary art. He's romanticising the former I fear. I wonder if this could be the opinion of a man who has spent a lifetime in fashion, and perhaps indulges fantasies that taking a 'deeper' path - maybe becoming a film maker for example - would prove to be more fulfilling. There's something rather immature about this attitude, no? As if the literary world is any less beholden to superficial trends and commercial cynicism than the world of contemporary art. I don't buy it! 

(I liked this movie a lot - if I didn't I wouldn't be thinking about it so much!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just saw Nocturnal Animals. I was pretty impressed with this film and engaged throughout - but I found it confusing. I felt like Ford had something to say, but I'm not sure what. Anyone care to tackle any of these questions? (**WARNING: Spoilers**); 

For starters, who do you think was the protagonist in this film? Who was the hero of the piece? Edward, or Susan (or both or neither). 

Does Ford *like* contemporary art, or view it as garbage? Was there something more authentic or worthwhile in the creative act of writing a novel in comparison to a creating a piece like the dancing ladies installation of the opening sequence? 

Is there a connection to be drawn between the various 'murders' in the narrative i.e. the murders in the novel and the termination of Susan and Edward's child (or even - at a stretch - the 'murder' of their love)?

Was Jake Gylenhaal's fictional character's (was his name Tony?) ending a triumph or a tragedy? Had he evolved into a 'stronger' man - or did his death indicate the terrible cost of such a transformation? 

:-)

Ps - anyone think this is worth making an actual post about? I can't find much discussion of Nocturnal Animals on the rest of the sub.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> (Ayyeessh - this is *long* - sorry!)

Hi I've been following this thread and although I'm not on your side (sorry!) I think it's cool that you are arguing LLL's corner without getting angry about it, as many do when discussing this film. I also thought Birdman was far from perfect so we can be friends about that later (!). 

For me, however, the positive points you make about LLL's structure and writing  - groundwork for characters being laid before they appear; thematic motifs returning throughout; environment used as a symbol of the central characters inner life - are really just observations on some very basic narrative devices. These are things movies are *supposed* to do - they are very basic starting points! I think that those of us who didn't rate the film very highly are looking for more, dare I say 'deeper' content. I would stress here that this only applies to LLL because of its rapturous reception by many critics, audiences, and awards ceremonies. If LLL were just another fun movie these discussions wouldn't be happening. 

As for the music being memorable, yes I think it *is* a significant point. I remember very well music from the last 20 years! Even if we don't compare LLL to 'the greats' like Singin In The Rain, I remember (in all seriousness) much of the music in, for example, the Southpark movie. Southpark was, in my opinion, an excellent movie musical, and I could sing you bits and pieces of the score right now. I also have a vague recollection of some of the songs in The Muppets (2011). Particularly in the case of Southpark, I would also argue that the songs functioned far better in terms of story telling than those in LLL, often occurring when a character or situation was going through some kind of transition - they moved the story on basically, and were not simply incidental comments on the narrative as I felt they were in LLL (with the exception possibly of Emma Stone's audition song which was transitional). Comparing both film's opening songs, which in the tradition of musicals are intended to establish a sense of location, I would argue Southpark's 'Mountain Town' functions far better than 'Another Day Of Sun', quite brilliantly introducing the town and setting the scene for the action to come, while at the same time introducing the major characters. Frankly, I had *no idea* what on earth the performers in 'Another Day Of Sun' were singing about (I couldn't make out the lyrics!) and for me the song established absolutely zero!

At the end of the day, there is not that much to say about LLL, and this is the problem. This is nothing to do with it being a 'popular' movie. Even when we avoid comparisons to art house films such as Cemetery Of Splendour, LLL doesn't stand up well. To take Southpark as an example again, this silly and often peurile animated musical had, in fact, quite a serious political subtext which attacked the hypocrisy of political correctness and left leaning liberalism (this is something people rarely comment on - for all its subversion, Southpark has a conservative heart). Take, as another example, the massively popular crowd-pleasing comedy Bridesmaids. This bawdy movie contains a deeply subversive feminist subtext - I could deconstruct it for days! These popular, unchallenging, entertaining mainstream films are, none the less, *about* something! What is LLL *about*?!

My own theory is that LLL was intended simply as a loving homage to Los Angeles, using a template provided by Scorsese's New York New York - a loving homage to New York (I would go so far as to suggest Chazelle *wants* us to make the comparison - I mean *New York New York* - *L.A L.A* - it's in the title!). My ultimate criticism would be, therefore, that I left the cinema without a real feeling of L.A. I wasn't inspired by Chazelle's vision of the city - I didn't feel I knew anything unique about its spirit or its character. From a foreign perspective (I'm not from the US) the choice of jazz and theatre based song to celebrate the spirit of L.A. seemed to make far less sense than Scorsese's use of this music to celebrate New York, a city the rest of the world associates with this kind of music. I suspect Hollywood's embracing and promoting of LLL as a 'great movie' has to do with a sense of loyalty and nostalgia for their home town. A film about L.A. that's simply a shiny happy celebration - that's a rare thing, and after 20 years of PT Anderson cleverly dismantling Hollywood and presenting it to the world as a kind of heart of global darkness, Hollywood is going to grab it with both hands and celebrate this rare note of positivity, perhaps turning a blind eye to the real qualities of the movie itself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was a brilliant actor - and classy as hell. I'm so impressed by his performances, it's hard to explain - he didn't draw a lot of attention to himself (if that makes any sense for an actor!), but quietly commited everything to character and story. He had a fascinating and unique presence - he could be kind of wicked when he wanted, or disdainful and cold, but underneath the surface you sensed a warm and tender heart. Anyone who could portray the vulnerability of the elephant man, and through all that make-up - that's amazing! His skill as a story teller was beyond compare - for me his narration in Dogville very nearly steals the show. When you think about how much he gave to that film with just his voice! He's an integral part of Dogville, and effortlessly achieves exactly the right tone - wry, knowing, ironic, but never giving too much away. A huge talent.  </TEXT>

Fellini's camera follows their backs mostly - the wind whips through their hair and flutters scarves - the camera gets close - moves back - it's a beautiful ballet of gliding movement, and completely magical.

<TEXT> Is *Rita Sue And Bob Too* (1987) obscure? It's a *very* British sex comedy set in the working class estates of Bradford. I love it - it's brazen, funny, energetic, and rough as hell. It also accurately portrays a period from my childhood I have never seen in any other film - teenage girls with big 80s hair, plastic shoes and knee length pastel cardigans. This is a celebration of a uniquely British attitude to sex - clumsy, giggly, unsophisticated - the very opposite to that regularly displayed by our French neighbours. Unusually however, the sexual content in *Rita Sue And Bob Too* displays none of the depressing 'wink wink' *Carry On* style of sexual comedy people associate with Britain. It's open and celebratory. This is rare for the UK.  </TEXT>

It may sound weird, but I've formed the impression that when I've overcooked the pasta a bit this dryness can tend to happen. Do not ask me why this might be. Apart from this you just need to up the liquid a bit. You'd be surprised how much liquid you can add to a carbonara without it turning soupy. Do you use vermouth? I always splash some dry vermouth into my bacon and let it bubble down a bit. I also add a large-ish ladle of pasta water to this mix, as well as not draining the pasta all that well. I use one egg per person - and in my house 160g of pasta is one serving (yes - I know). Don't add too much cheese to the eggs.

<TEXT> Hi Guys - my usual random kitchen question after a bit of a cooking fail! I'll make it short - purchased some *raw buttermilk* from the farmer's market. Despite it tasting absolutely horrible (like milk that should have been used two weeks ago) I persevered and used it to marinate a wild rabbit someone gave me (around 18 hours). My thinking was this would make for nice tender rabbit (I eat rabbit quite a lot and know it can be a bit tough). Anyway, short story shorter, this turned out to be the toughest rabbit I've ever eaten. It could be this was simply a tough old animal that would never be pleasant to eat. It could be that I messed up the cooking - but as I said I kind of know what I'm doing with rabbit (braised it low and slow in stock for 3 hours and rested for 30 minutes). Is there any chance this could have been something to do with the buttermilk? Does the marinating idea only work for specific meats?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting explanation - thanks. My problem with Innaritu's idea there is that to me his films strongly communicate to an audience there is a great deal of literal meaning (a *message*) there to be followed and absorbed by the audience. There were so many ideas on everything from social media to post-modernism in *Birdman* it was bewildering - but it all *meant* something - and something *big*. So, if Tarkovsky includes a random firey comet in a film I take it for a poetic symbol of something intangible - as something I just go with and *feel*. With Innaritu my instinct is to look for *what it means*. If you're always telling the audience your movie is an allegory - don't make the allegory illusive. Gah! - illusive allegory is a *pet hate* of mine!! But, as I said, I did not connect with this film. 

*Uncle Boonmee* - we're now approaching a film experience that has little in common with the way regular audiences watch regular movies! The unpronounceable Thai (I will google it later!) makes films that are close to a meditative experience. You just have to sit with them - and yes that may well include getting a little bored here and there. It's a totally different ball game! Thanks for your interesting comment :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes you just don't connect with a film artist. It's frustrating (believe me - I *know*) when it's somebody that seems to be universlly adored. Kubrick is, IMO, a difficult artist. Not because his films are particularly clever (although of course they are often very clever), but because his ego is so apparent in his work. His presence can be stifling.

He is admired, I think, for his intellectual rigour, his audacity, and his extraordinary single mindedness. Kubrick pandered to *no-one* - not Hollywood, not his producers, not his actors, not even his audience. He pleased himself, and there is something inspiring about such an uncompromising artist. Basically he has massive balls. 

The work itself is often thrillingly dramatic. Kubrick had a great flair for composition, knowing when and where to push an audiences buttons to maximum effect. *The Shining* is a good example of this flair for drama, which at times borders on the theatrical. The theatricality is tempered by his direction of actors, which was punishing - he ground actors into submission by making them repeat a scene so many times they abandoned their ego. The technique worked - there is a style of 'Kubrickian performance', dry, measured, and assured, that is quite distinctive. Of course this combative approach (rather than collaborative) is another sign of the man's overwhelming ego. (There are exceptions in the case of the odd actor Kubrick seemed to genuinely admire - Peter Sellers and Jack Nicholson for example). 

He is also greatly admired for technical innovation, to which he was never so beholden that he allowed it overwhelm his story telling. The steady-cam in *The Shining* for example is used as a wonderful story-telling tool - never simply for the admiration of the technology itself. 

The downside of Kubrick is his extreme control can feel claustrophobic - it can easily turn the viewer off. In addition it meant that his portfolio was highly hit and miss. He did get things wrong, and such was his overwhelming command that his mistakes translate directly onto the screen. The result is that when he is good he is very very good, but when he is bad he is *rotten*. There are all kinds of reasons for not connecting with Kubrick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a minefield for the ego is it not?? There are several highly regarded big name directors who's work leaves me completely cold. Generally my ego tells me that I know best - that these directors are not very good and their fans are misled and basically not as clever as me. Some of them I would indeed think of as 'pretentious' - very much so. But maybe it is, as you say, that I simply don't *get* them. Often though, I find that when I try to *get* the films by asking others - 'what was that about for you - what was the director trying to say here?' - they don't know. A really good example is *Birdman*. I have yet to meet a single individual who can explain to me the meaning of the firey commet in the sky. In fact, I have even had people denying the existence of the firey commet in the sky - firey commet deniers I call them. But it's there God damn it - and nobody has any idea why! (Challenge for the *Birdman* fans out here!).

Of course this is complicated by the fact that 'getting' a film and 'understanding' a film are not the same thing. You can connect with a film on a level you don't understand, without understanding why. I had exactly the opposite reaction from the top commenter here, in that the first time I saw *2001* I was absolutely electrified by it. I didn't know why. I *got* the film - I didn't understand it. Now I feel I both get and understand the film, but the understanding took effort.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would never normally comment on this film as I have quite a low opinion of it and it seems to be pretty universally adored. But I totally agree with what you say. I find with Aronofsky that he's one of those directors who is intent, above all else, on *blowing my mind*. He attempts to do this with a full on visceral assault, employing every trick in the book, flashy editing, sound, and all kinds of clever effects. Unfortunately, such an array of tricks add up to a pretty blunt instrument. For me, before *Requiem* is anything, it is *hard hitting*. I switch off.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the end of the day, there are just too many 'fuzzy' elements in this film make to it a suitable springboard for discussion on something as divisive as race. One fuzziness is the characterisation. Another is, as you point out, Chazelle's apparent lack of enthusiasm for jazz as an artform, and, come to that, for music in general.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  can anybody who truly adores this movie account for why Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) never exchanges a single audible line of dialogue with all the venerable black jazz musicians he moonlights with?

I don't adore the movie but I think I can answer this. Gosling's character, and Chazelle's characters in general, exchange lines with an absolute minimum of other characters, black, white, blue, or any other colour. He has a rigid and very specific vision of high creative achievement which is absolutely centred on the *individual* artist. As a review in The New Yorker cleverly observed, the same criticism could be aimed at Stone's character and her 'play' that she, apparently, writes, rehearses, produces, and stars in without the help of so much as a stage manager to switch the lights on and off. This is just before she runs off home to spend time with her faceless 'shadow family'. See where I'm going? For better or worse (depending on whether you love the film or hate it), Chazelle likes to keep his characters in as isolated a state as possible - as if they exist in a kind of exclusive bubble. The result may imply that he's somehow in denial of the intrinsic blackness of jazz music, but this is just an unfortunate by-product of his rather under-developed (*just in my opinion folks!!*) characterisation. 

(edit for grammar)

<TEXT> Just one best film entry from me - **HyperNormalisation** by Adam Curtis (2 points). This is a feature length documentary made for the BBC. It's billed as a documentary, but in fact Curtis's work inhabits a unique category all on its own. It's not true documentary really, as what he presents is a bold interpretation of events, rather than attempting to present reality in an absolute way. Through his highly expressive use of music, sound, heavily edited archive footage, and text, Curtis is creating a form of his own, somewhere between factual documentary and abstract video art. I find it thrilling. *HyperNormalisation* was the only film in 2016 that made my hair stand on end, and also the only film that made me cry.  </TEXT>

I don't like it when you call me an asshole. You need to learn the difference between challenging someone's point of view in a constructive way, and allowing your passion for a subject to lead you to become angry and attack an individuals character. We are, after all, only talking about a movie here. In retrospect the tone I used in my original comment is perhaps verging on this behaviour itself - I admit that. But I think it's important to notice I was not addressing an individual with my comment. If it contained a personal attack it was aimed towards the movie itself, and at the end an abstract concept of 'America'. There is never a good reason to refer to a stranger as an arrogant asshole in an online discussion about a film. Think it - sure. Don't say it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes - I know exactly what you mean. First time I saw MF was in McQueen's superb film *Hunger* - and he is really fantastic in that. But I get the impression he's one of those potentially great actors who got lazy really quickly. Having said that, he has an intensely masculine presence and confidence on screen, even when he doesn't seem to be doing much acting. It makes him wonderfully castable! I would add that you do have to look at the possibility that Fassbender is a fantastic actor and there simply have not been the great films for him to star in. His relationship with McQueen looked so promising - it's not his fault McQueen decided to start boring everyone to death all over the place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No - I don't believe cinema can experience another revolutionary wave of new film making, at least not in the way you're thinking of with the *Breathless* example. I think this has to do with the waves of youth culture that began after the Second World War in Europe and the US. The beat generation - rock - mods - hippies - punk and all the rest - each wave of popular/youth culture superseded the last, and each counter-culture reinvented the world in its own way. But the waves have subsided. Counter-culture these days has become subsumed by the wider culture as a whole. Popular culture *is* culture. 

Deeply enmeshed with this development is the emergence of post-modernism, which, with its inherent ironic stance and skepticism towards any entirely hopeful ideology, is very effective in disabling the kind of confidence and bravado displayed by counter-culture movements of the past (e.g. the jazz influenced 'beat generation' from which *Breathless* sprang).

What I think you *can* observe might be 'quiet revolution' films - those that change the game in their own way, but do not draw universal attention to themselves or have any particular connection to a youth culture. As someone else has pointed out already in these comments, the work of Thai auteur Weerasethakul could be offered as an example of this. For me - and this is a very personal POV - Weerasethakul is exploring the last hopeful frontier of human belief systems, which you might call the spiritual. This quiet spirituality is as far as you could imagine from the destructive dogma of organised religion, and is characterised by its uncertainty, and above all, its humanity. I would add some works by Haneke, Oppenheimer and Anderson among others to this... what would you call it? A 'non-movement'? It must remain undefined, because to define it might well be to destroy it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They didn't end up together because why exactly?

They didn't end up together because DeNiro and Minelli didn't end up together at the end of *New York New York*. I agree with every element of your comment - but please tell me, what was it about this movie you found so funny? Where were the funny parts? Gosling (who I really like as an actor) did his best to inject some life into the thing by giving his character as much of a wry self-knowing edge as he could extrapolate from the script, but even this was what I'd call charming and attractive rather than 'funny'. I laughed *once* - when a woman in an audition said 'lady why is you trippin' in a dead pan voice. I don't know what this film was. For me it had no identity. It was not a comedy. It was not a drama. It was not a satire. It was not a satirical comedy-drama. I guess it was a romance (?), but what film is 'a romance' and that's it? Romances are funny or tragic or both. Being 'a musical' doesn't cut it either for the same reasons. I'm going to stop commenting on this film as I feel like I've wandered into a parallel universe where the definition of a good movie has turned on its head. It's actually starting to freak me out. I feel like Catherine Ross in *The Stepford Wives*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not alone! :-)  I've thought about this film a *lot* because of this thread, and I would now say it's giving the audience two choices (and I'm going to get a bit *Team America* here): Be a pussy, or be a dick. Now pussies are, of course, pussies, and that's pretty much all they get to be. The down side of being a pussy is you abandon your dream and you end up apologising to guys in movie theatres who hit you in the head with their popcorn carton. You get a family, but there's nothing all that enjoyable about the family and it's all pretty hollow and superficial. You don't get to enjoy your life because deep down you're full of regrets about the past and your lost dream still haunts you. Dicks are dicks. The downside of being a dick is that you act like a dick and you don't get friends, romance, or family. But dicks get glory. Dicks realise their dream. Dicks get to experience a magical, creative transcendence that is so much more awesome than dinner with your phoney broken family or a pizza with some directionless pussy girl there really is no competition. The choice seems pretty simple to me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I more or less hated *La La Land*. I felt like it was pretty vacuous if I'm honest. It reminded me very much of those GAP commercials with Sarah Jessica Parker. As with his previous film, *Whiplash*, Chazelle is concerned with characters who have an undiscovered great talent, and their great talent is what brings them to success at the end. A far more interesting film would have been about a couple of losers with no talent, and how they set about finding value in their lives. As with *Whiplash* the special talented people sacrificed love for their art - it seems for him this is mandatory for success to be achieved. I find this idea less than fascinating and, anyway, inaccurate. His thesis on 'old' culture vs 'new' culture was beginning to look interesting, but he took it nowhere and it completely fizzled out. My overriding thought throughout the film was - *please don't make a film about how movies aren't as good as they used to be and make that film a very pale imitation of how movies used to be, thereby reminding us that movies aren't as good as they used to be*. In effect Chazelle is gleefully stubbing out a cigarette on the dying corpse of cinema. Nice. 

But more than any of this I'm kind of dismayed that no-one is talking about how much this film owes to Scorsese's *New York New York*. There *must* be some stuff about this out there but as yet I have been unable to find it. *La La Land* is simply a lighter, dumber version of Scorsese's earlier film. Now - *New York New York* was itself a kind of knowing, post-moderny homage to the golden age of Hollywood musicals. Now we have *La La Land* - a dumbed-down homage to a post modern homage..... stop - the cultural redundancy is making me nauseous. I remember after *Whiplash* thinking - 'isn't he kind of doing *Raging Bull* with bits of *Taxi Driver* thrown in?' My suspicions are confirmed by *La La Land* - his *New York New York*. Can't wait for his next Scorsese reboot. 

And this is going to win a bunch of oscars right? Well everyone loves bright flashy colours and a bit of a song and dance - especially in this day and age, huh? OK - keep singing America - I'm sure everything's going to be *just fine*...... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate your POV - actually I think we have similar interpretations of the movie, but just view the interpretation from a different angle (if that makes sense!). I just don't see the question mark at the end of the film. I don't think it's there in the film - but I think the question mark occurred to you as a viewer, and this is absolutely valid. I mean it's not hard to figure the question mark out for yourself right? It's not hard to see the story of the musician who committed suicide as a sort of premonition of Andrew's future, right? I agree with you. But, just for me, the absence of any doubtful note at the end of the movie (and it need only have been tiny) left me feeling the film was telling me it *was* all worth it. In writing this I'm remembering the Father's astonished face peering through the window of the stage door. Remember that? *This* is the kind of questioning note I am looking for - but the problem with this is the Father was such a sketch of a character this potential questioning note just didn't land. The Father was a 'pussy', and that's about it. We knew that from the first encounter with him when he apologises to a man who walks into him. OK - he's a pussy. And that's about all we find out about him. So Andrew is avoiding becoming like his father. He is avoiding being a pussy all his life. That's good isn't it? It's simple no? Where was the *worth* in his father's life? What did his father have that Andrew didn't that Andrew was giving up to become a great musician? I needed this balance in the narrative. I needed to know, for example, what his life had become during the period he gave up drumming. We knew nothing. Andrew seemed to be exactly the same as he was before. At the end, when his father was staring at him through the door, all I read was 'see? he aint no pussy bitch'. At the end of the day perhaps the flaw we are arguing over here is simply that Andrew's relationships outside of his musical life were terribly underdeveloped. For example, although we were led to believe Andrew was kind of a loner, it didn't really seem all that difficult for him to ask the movie theatre girl out. He seemed pretty cool and suave about it, and he didn't seem to struggle particularly with the dates. He didn't seem all that elated about it either. The stakes were just not high enough - they really weren't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  To my mind, the film isn't saying it was worth it so much as asking whether it was worth it, with the rest of the movie mostly supporting the response of "no."

We will have to agree to disagree there. For me the character of Andrew is just not fleshed out enough for me to understand why he is suffering particularly (apart from the physical and mental suffering he endures as a direct result of his music training). The relationship woth his Father and with his girlfriend could have been way more developed to supply this information. For me, the moment a director chooses to exit a character's narrative is a strong indication of how he wants the audience to respond to said narrative. In the case of *Whiplash* we were left with a great surge of an upbeat and a climactic triumph (to my mind we can assume that the Lincoln Centre scouts or whoever we had been told were in the audience would surely be talking of nothing else than the incredible young percussionist who stole the entire show from everybody else and created a moment of musical genius on stage.... no?)

 As for your edit, that's an extremely interesting idea. Could you explain more what you mean by irony? Haven't seen Raging Bull (I know...) and it's been a while since I watched Taxi Driver.

Travis Bickle is aiming for greatness, but in a dark and deranged way. The audience know that his definition of 'greatness' is likely to prove catastrophic for him and for others. We know that he is in fact mentally ill and is using the irrational and warped logic of a phychopath to justify his violent fantasy. Travis realises his fantasy.... and for a short time becomes a national hero. The woman who spurned him for being a creepy wierdo reappears, forgiving and open to rekindling the romance. Travis rejects her - he has moved on, his crusade apparantly having allowed him to re-enter 'normal' society for the time being at least. This is a highly ironic outcome - very similar to the comic re-telling of *Taxi Driver* Scorsese created with *King Of Comedy*. It's ironic because Travis is a creepy wierdo.

LaMotta's ending is actually not particularly ironic, so I take that back. It's tragic.

<TEXT>  And again, I agree with you on that final scene not feeling good. It's the culmination of this twisted mentality and I was honestly terrified through it.

That's very interesting - I read it quite differently. I saw the scene as triumphant (although I was not buying it) - the camera tricks - the fading in and out of sound - I felt like the director was attempting to communicate an extraordinary, transcendental experience - almost an out of body experience where the musician was entirely subsumed by his performance - at one with the drums. I felt like we were witnessing at last the creation of greatness - of great art. I felt like the film was saying 'see? it was all worth it in the end'. If the intention was otherwise, I feel like the film should have ended in a different way, and not with this extreme experience during a performance. 

(Edit: Just when I was writing that I realised the similarities between the way this and other drumming scene were filmed and the boxing scenes in *Raging Bull*. This is interesting to me, because I remember when I was watching *Whiplash* the scene where Andrew calls his x-girlfriend very much reminded me of a similar scene from *Taxi Driver*. It's becoming apparent to me how Scorsese-influenced this film is. Was Andrew intended as a sort of Scorsese/Deniro style hero? If so, what the film greatly lacked was a level of irony. Travis Bickle - Jake LaMotta - anti-heroes who's narratives are imbued with deep irony. Andrew in *Whiplash* - no irony at all. The unseen character in *Whiplash* who committed suicide halfway through the film - **that's** who the film should have been about. **That's** the film I would want to see.) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Sacrifice is necessary in the creation of art.

Sacrifice.... or a kind of masochistic submission to a brutal, mentally ill dictator? And, while we're at it, I would also take issue with calling what our hero was aiming for as the 'creation of art'. He was aiming for a kind of iconic *greatness*, and in the world of *Whiplash* this can only be achieved through a kind of 'marine core' approach to life. It's just depressing tbh - and also retrograde. Have we not outgrown this kind of machismo? It's so destructive in this day and age. Is this what we need? The final would-be spectacular drum solo was less an enjoyable piece of music and more operation desert storm! 

Just on a side note, I was also annoyed by the strange homophobic/homoerotic undertones at play. The regular homophobic slurs were unnecessary, and therefore offensive. At the same time there was this corny sexual tension between the central pairing. More than once I murmured 'jeez - get a room' as the clumsy s m relationship developed. As for the finale - I've rarely seen a more extravagant simultaneous cum shot. All in all I felt this film was the bastard child of *Fame*, *Rocky*, and *50 Shades Of Grey*. 

Thanks for your advice on *La La*. I think I'll wait for the DVD release! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Everybody - this post will be a bit of a rant but also a question. So I'm intrigued by *La La Land* and was planning on seeing it ASAP when it's released here in the UK (this week I think). In the meantime I thought I would brush up on Chazelle by watching *Whiplash* which is available on Amazon. Well - I just don't know - I found *Whiplash* to be one of the most ridiculous films I've ever seen, with a truly detestable narrative which could serve as propaganda for some fascist dictatorship. You know, the Germans and the Japanese used to make films like this in the 1930s. It was overblown macho bullshit from start to finish, and I immediately cancelled my plans to see *La La Land*. If the USA is entering a new Reaganite era, I thought, I'm not going to sit around watching whatever dumb *Top Gun* narratives it's going to start telling itself in the process. But listen - to those who have seen both *Whiplash* and *La La Land* - would I be missing out by not seeing the new film? Is it a *very* different beast? Anyone hate *Whiplash* as much as me but loved *La La Land*?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both the theory about the way you cut the onions and which parts you should eat, and also braising them for a FOS. Interesting ideas - but maybe the cutting one is getting into that 'chefy' area that's probably too pernickety for home cooks :-) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tall order - seasonal cookbook for winter months? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-07 18:44:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everybody. Bit of a tricky question this - not least because I'm in the UK and most reddit users are in the US. But anyway, I enjoy buying food at the farmer's market and am a dedicated locavore (within reason - I'm not about to start living without lemons!). I'm also very into seasonal eating. In addition I recently began a loose 'meat-free weekdays' thing, so I buy meat at the market on a Saturday and once it's gone there is no meat till the following Saturday. But I'm beginning to find this way of eating a bit of a struggle. My dream is to find a great cook book that will help me out. I want to eat veggy mid-week meals made from local seasonal (to UK) produce. I don't want these meals to always be risotto (or any variation on risotto eg 'speltato') or pasta. I don't want them to always be Asian and I don't want them always to be soup. As if all this wasn't demanding enough (!) I don't want to feel (as I often do) that I'm serving a side dish for dinner. Tall order I know - but any ideas out there? :-)

Edit: regularly available to me in winter are big old roots and tough old greens: carrots potatoes cabbage swede (rutabaga?) kale beets spinach - I also can get the odd cauliflower and also celariac - you get the picture. Apples are still around too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi - *obsessed* with french onion soup. I've found it's one of those recipes where different 'authorities' will give you a variation on the recipe (e.g. chicken stock or beef stock) and swear theirs is *the* authentic version - so searching for the definitive french onion soup is a bit like searching for the definitive Salade Nicoise. Enjoyable but inconclusive! The best version I've made at home came from David Leibovitz's My Paris Kitchen. Apart from anything else, this is the only recipe I've found that gives you a realistic time for the onion caramelising process - at least a couple of hours. He uses chicken stock but I go for veal - only because I use a lot of chicken stock and this makes a change. IMO the quality of the stock is the key to a good FOS. It should glue your lips together. It's also important the weather is right - for me, FOS is for a freezing cold day - one that merits a slug of brandy to finish the soup off. I don't think it should be too thick, overly full of onion, or have chunks of meat in it! It should not be bitter.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes you do need to watch the movie - just because it's awesome! There is indeed lots of glass, and it does indeed serve in the manner outlined above. For me it's also used to fracture the reality of the world the film creates. Scenes are sometimes filmed in part as reflections in glass - so two or even three perspectives can be layered into the image at once. The reality of the film, as well as reality as the characters in the film experience it, is hard to pin down - illusive. The use of glass at once comments on the experience of the characters, and at the same time exposes a meta-narrative, meaning that the director wants us to question the reality of what we are witnessing, and thereby question the *meaning* of what we are witnessing. He doesn't want us to stop thinking. In this way too the glass reminds us of the lens - of the glass that exists in the lens of the camera. This in turn references the strong narrative thread in the movie (to which both the children are connected) that is about cinema itself. This is indeed a 'post modern' film in that among its myriad functions it is in part concerned with deconstructing and discussing film itself. Yi Yi is an extraordinary work of art! </TEXT>

<TEXT> What a deeply thought out interpretation of this film. I'm especially taken with the economic context you have described - something I hadn't considered before. But there seems to be an overwhelmingly pessimistic tone to your interpretation I recognise only in part from the film (if I understand your post correctly - I confess some of it is beyond me!). For me *Yi Yi* is a film that touches on the idea of transcendence through a kind of giving in - an abandonment of striving and of questioning - a submission. This is perhaps neither a good nor a bad thing - neither pessimistic nor optimistic. It is what it is, and in a way requires that the audience submit in a similar way to the characters in the film. On a spiritual level it's very beautiful. But in such a film many many interpretations can and do exist at once - this is what makes it a great work of art. Thanks for your post.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really expect anything from Reddit - it is what it is. Having expectations of the internet is a losers game! I started looking at this sub in the hope that it might lead me to some great movies I hadn't seen. This hasn't really happened - I'm not boasting when I say I've seen all the great movies - I'm sad about it and also it's an indication of how old I am! Having said that I have over the past few years seen three or four excellent films I didn't know about because they were mentioned on this site and I'm grateful for that. 

Personally I find that often armchair cineasts have very fixed ideas about film, and many posts are an opportunity for them to tell the world what they think about a certain film or director (and i totally include myself in this group). If I agree I agree - if I don't I don't - but because of this many posts seem to be conversation stoppers rather than starters! What I really respond to are posts that ask a question about a particular aspect of film making (e.g. photography - editing - music - acting styles etc) using maybe two or three films as examples, rather than posts about one specific film. 

I wouldn't try and change anything about Truefilm - as another comment suggests, the only way to raise the bar here is to make some good posts of your own. 

(One last grumble - there are far too many posts about Kubrick and Christopher Nolan!)

<TEXT> I've seen *The Conformist* twice. My memory of it is always preoccupied with style - obviously it's an incredibly stylish film. But what is it *about*? I'm pretty handy at deconstructing movies, but I wouldn't be able to help you out with *The Conformist*. I'd need to see the movie again and really focus on meaning and subtext. Sometimes I do this without really intending to, but there's something about Bertolucci that simply does not invite this kind of analysis for me. My favourite Bertolucci by far is *Last Tango*, and I've seen that film many times, but still I don't think I could sit down and tell you what it's *about*. I find watching his films a bit like watching Opera. He has the ability to create these beautiful set pieces (a bit like arias) that you just want to sit back and drink in. It's self indulgent sure, but good God - the beauty of what he can do! Such beauty can't be wrong! But what does it *mean*? I don't know! </TEXT>

Additional Dardenne brothers: *L'enfant* and *Rosetta*  

Additional Kiarostami: *10*  

Additional Varda: *Vagabond* (essential)

And you have *no* Pialat on your list - Sacr Bleu! Add *Nous Ne Vieillirons Pas Ensemble*, *La Gueule Ouverte*, *Loulou*, *A Nos Amours* (essential), and *Van Gogh*. 

I'm also not seeing Blier's *Les Valseuses*. 

Have you seen Truffaut's *Les Quatre Cent Coups*? Add that too. 

But wow - even without my suggestions you're in for quite an experience with that list! Tell us how it goes!

Edit: Personally I would also add Desplechim's *Rois Et Rien* - but that's a very personal choice there! (Also *Tuesday, After Christmas* - OK I'm going to stop now)

(And *Les Enfants Du Paradis*...  I can't stop!)

<TITLE> No-puff pastry fail </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-04 17:59:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello wise and helpful kitchen elves. 

Puff pastry fail. I make my own puff pastry and have had no problems with it.... up until last night when I made a venison wellington for a dinner party. Major fail. The pastry totally failed to puff and I had to sit through that grimmest of social trials where polite guests feel they must eat a layers of sweaty looking grey dough and go 'mmmmmm lovely pastry' or else witness you attempting to slash you wrists with a carving knife. I can think of a few reasons this might have gone so wrong - but I could use a second opinion. Here's the facts:

-I was not cooking in my own home with my own oven. 

-The pastry had been in the freezer for about three weeks and I removed it probably two hours before using it. I did not defrost in the fridge but at room temperature. 

-I struggled with the host's rolling pin, which is much lighter and thinner than my own, and I remember wondering at the time if I was rolling the life out of my pastry. 

-On removing the wellington from the fridge I remember thinking the pastry seemed somewhat damp and sticky - this didn't feel right. 

-The oven was gas, unlike mine which is electric, but I did have an oven thermometer with me and the wellington went in at 200C (390F). 

So was it the rolling? The temperature (too warm)? The unfamiliar oven? I'm thinking it was a rolling problem, and also maybe I left the dough to get too warm before hand. Anyone else?

<TEXT> Reposting this as it failed to appear on the main page - no idea why - 

I enjoy listening to the Slovenian Cultural theorist and film critic Slavoj Zizek. I recently heard him state the three best films ever made were The Fountainhead (USA 1949), Opfergang (Germany 1944), and Ivan The Terrible (USSR 1944). I don't know if Zizek is being sincere about this - he enjoys a joke after all, and I know these films are all works of propaganda for either far right views (Zizek is a socialist) or totalitarian regimes. I have seen none of the films and they are difficult for me to get hold of without spending a lot of money on DVDs. I was wondering if any truefilmers had an opinion on any of these three films. Is Zizek pulling my leg, or are these great works of art? Any comments welcome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Everybody. I've been using almonds a lot recently and am very much bothered by the rogue 'bad almond' in the bag. This evil little nut infiltrates almond dishes and gives them a background note of nasty chemical bitter taste. The bad nut looks *exactly the same* as all the others! Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution? I'm (apparently) very sensitive to bitter and the bad almond taste puts me off a dish completely. Today I opened a treasured jar of apricots and almonds in amaretto I bottled back in July, only to detect that familiar unwelcome bitter note! Gah! The swines have tainted my much anticipated apricots! Help! (FYI: I buy organic whole almonds from the health food store). 

Edit one day later: Just to clear this up, I've found out that 'bitter almonds' are a different variety of almond that contain a higher amount of cyanide. My problem bad-tasting almonds are (I'm assuming) regular sweet almonds that have gone bad. Thanks for all your replies so far! :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to pick *Wild Strawberries*. I have a sense that it's a little looked down upon among Bergman's films - not quite up there with *Seventh Seal* for example (which I find kind of a struggle). Perhaps this is because *Wild Strawberries* is so easy to watch, or perhaps Bergman's character study is considered a little by-the-book or too easy. But for me the film comes close to communicating a real human experience and a real human mind, complete with all of its mysterious poetry. Dreams, memory, accident - everything tumbles together to guide the central character towards love. This happens in life, and inadequate though it is, it's perhaps the best evidence we can have of the presence of God. The idea that Bergman captured it in this movie and presents it with such artistry and care is something I find very moving. I come back to *Wild Strawberries* every few years and each time it means more to me.  </TEXT>

How exciting to find a sub dedicated to ice cream - surely the food of the Gods. 
I have a dinner party coming up next weekend and for dessert I'd like to make an ice cream. I have in my store cupboard a jar of cherries preserved in brandy and also a jar of apricots and almonds in amaretto. I'd like to use one of the jars for an ice cream. I could of course just make a batch of delicious vanilla and spoon the fruit over that, but I'd like to go fancy. My idea so far is to make an almond/choc chip/cherry ice cream and maybe reduce the alcohol syrup from the jar to make a sauce. Anyone have a delicious alternative? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A while back I realised that most of the films (about 90%) that make up my top list can be considered spiritual or even religious on some level. This was a great surprise to me because I'm not religious in the slightest. Examples are films like *Taste Of Cherry*, *Bad Lieutenant*, Varda's *Le Bonheur*, or *The Act Of Killing*. All of my favourite films contain, at least, the questioning of the limits of human experience. Some, like *Syndromes And A Century* or *Mirror*, are almost spiritual acts in themselves - prayers or meditations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that Mamet should just not both write and direct the same projects. My personal view is that he is at heart a theatre artist. His dialogue is inherently theatrical and all his instincts are for theatre. If drama works brilliantly in the theatre there is no guarantee it will easily translate to film - just look at attempts to make great plays into films, like Miller's *The Crucible*, or the more recent *August Osage County*. With *Glengarry* you had a film artist as director who managed to pull off a very successful adaptation - although tbh I'm not really sure exactly why that text worked so well on screen. It had the benefit of probably one of the most talented ensemble casts ever assembled for a movie, all of whom (I think) were well seasoned actors of both stage and screen (not sure if Lemmon had done much on stage) and so knew well how to make the transition. It was also brilliantly directed by Foley. 

Mamet's stage writing is harsh, often bleak and frequently cruel. This type of writing works well on stage, because there is such an obvious level of unreality, and the audience have some distance on the thing - both physically and emotionally. Often when such writing is put on the big screen the coldness and cruelty is simply too much. Film is so much more of a literal, immersive form; and audience simply can't take it. And so directors often try and soften things. Characters become 'nicer' than their stage versions (this was very true of *August Osage County* - there's just no way a cinema audience could sustain the tragedy and cruelty of that play). When directing his own work, I think Mamet just does not know how to make this transition well. In toning down his own work he loses his way and creates films that lack an identity an audience can really relate to. His characters become strange or even bland. 

Probably *Glengarry* works partly because Foley managed to film the action with all of its original venom while somehow keeping the audience on side. I'm wondering if this is partly down to his camera work, which I remember being brilliant in that film. He focuses in on faces when he needs to, but at other times he pulls the camera right back so that we have some distance and can process what's happening without turning off. Sometimes he replaces the physical distance we would experience in the theatre with darkness - we are close, but the darkness gives us some element of protection from what we are witnessing. In addition, Foley and the production designer created a truly cinematic world for the action - the lights - the rain - the trains - it gives the action a context that uses singularly cinematic techniques to tell the story, and greatly helps the transition from a theatrical piece to a filmic one. This is something I have never seen Mamet manage to do on film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I'm starting with 1 litre of whole goats milk (I think this is just over 4 cups) and 150g of sugar, plus 2 tablespoons of glucose syrup. Your comment interests me because I actually cut the amount of sugar in the recipe. The recipe asks for 200g, but I prefer the cajeta slightly less sweet. 

Just doing a brief internet search into making condensed milk, I notice the recipes online all include a significant proportion of butter. So I'm thinking Dulce De Leche also includes the butter (obviously!), which is going to change the caramel layer of the tart significantly in terms of fat content. Have I been labouring under the illusion that Cajeta and Dulce De Leche are basically the came thing? Weirdly, I have had the thought that adding butter to the cajeta might help stabilise it somehow - but I dismissed this idea as it seemed from of world of food science beyond my grasp! Maybe I was onto something!

<TEXT> Hi! First time posting here. This is a cut-n-paste from a post I just made over at /askculinary. Someone suggested I post here too. Thanks for anyone who reads this - it's kinda long :-)
___________________________________________________

Gah! I need help! First off I apologise for posting about the same topic twice, but this particular culinary problem is fast becoming the bane of my existence.

It's [David Lebovitz's Chocolate Dulce De Leche Tart](https://chroniclingthekitchen.wordpress.com/2014/08/18/chocolate-dulce-de-leche-tart/) again.

OK I will try and make this as concise as possible. I adore Dulce De Leche made with goat's milk (Cajeta is its official name I believe) and would like to use it in this tart in stead of the store-bought cow's variety (which is not available in my local stores anyway). So I make my own.

First attempt at this tart was not good because (I now realise) my oven cools down very slowly, so when it came to putting the tart into the 150C oven (after it had been at 200C for the pastry) the oven was still too hot and the tart overbaked. Overbaking actually spoils the taste of this tart, as well as making it look ugly. But the overbaked version did not crack on top.

Next attempt - the tart was beautiful on top - dark, glossy, and thrillingly wobbly (I'm lucky enough to have two ovens so I used them both - one hot one cool) but on attempting to serve I watched in horror as the Cajeta ran out of the case in a steady stream and pooled on the table top. In front of guests. I asked you wise kitchen owls what might be the problem, and a very helpful redditor suggested condensation, and I thought that was a good bet because indeed I had let my tart case cool before filling with the chocolate.

To cut a long and painful story short, every attempt since has featured not only similarly runny cajeta, but in addition the top of the tart has started to crack about 5 - 10 minutes out of the oven and cajeta has oozed to the surface creating scary big K shaped cracks that mirror perfectly the slowly forming cracks in my mental health as a successful version of this potentially show-stopping tart continues to evade me.

Any ideas? FYI, my cajeta, when at room temperature, is the consistency of hard chewy toffee, requiring some gentle warming to even get it out of the bowl. Is my home made cajeta just a different animal to the store-bought dulce de leche, and will never work in this tart? I would so love it to - because despite the disappointing presentation, the combination of salty goat's milk cajeta and dark bitter chocolate is absolutely heavenly.

Help me......

Edit: The latest version has a layer at the bottom of chewy cajeta, similar to how it was before it went into the tart, but still runny cajeta on top and oozing out of cracks. I notice that the tart top develops condensation about two hours out of the oven. There is definitely a condensation problem here I think.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know what you mean about *Brooklyn*, but I would argue conflict is introduced very early on with the scene with the nasty old shop keeper. This sets up the idea that the main character is being disloyal in leaving Ireland, illustrating her internal conflict that is not resolved until the very end of the film. This central conflict is the principle driving force behind the narrative. 

Your comment made me think of *Le Bonheur* by Agnes Varda. I'm not saying this film contains no conflict - but I'm suggesting its handling of conflict is highly original. **Spoiler Alert**  The central male character is unfaithful to his wife, and experiences no guilt or conflict within himself about this. The film proceeds to portray his relationships through what could be described as an uncomplicated experssion of conflict-free happiness (the joy he experiences with the tow women seems only to intensify and increase as a result of the situation). Although shit hits the fan somewhat in the final ten minutes of the film (and this tragic ending is itself deeply ambiguous), I guess for the most part conflict is experienced only in the minds of the audience.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeh - big Herzog fan here, but this did nothing for me. It was rambling and failed, I felt, to communicate any interesting ideas. I didn't get what it was about, apart from... y'know... Volcanos. The exploration of the cultural mythology surrounding Volcanos was not nearly so interesting as the introduction promised. This was a terribly *male* film - I grew tired of these boys and their rather nerdy club. During the never-ending let's-look-for-bones-in-the-dessert segment I made myself not one, but two cups of tea. And just a personal quibble: I'm a little tired of documentary makers filming those poor North Koreans desperately acting out their grotesque pantomimes for western cameras. Yeh it makes engaging TV, but really, those are some of the most wretched individuals on our planet and I'm getting uncomfortable ogling them like creatures in a zoo. But generally I would describe *Into The Inferno* as a creative travelogue more than anything else; and rather a self indulgent one. I'm sure Werner had a great time traveling to all those remote places! Well, he deserves it I guess. 

Edit: Just noticed I wrote 'dessert' by mistake but have left it in because it's pretty funny.  </TEXT>

I feel that if you look beneath the populist surface of Lee's films, there is often a fascinating, sometimes quite profound idea or set of ideas at play. I disagree that CTHD was a very straight story. It included an audacious feminist subtext that (I'm guessing) is pretty original for the genre (could be wrong there). Rather than submit to the patriarchy that sought to control her, Jen Yu chose instead a kind of suicide which was also an unknowable transcendence. In evading her masters, she also chose to turn her back on romantic love. The film's story is primarily a romance featuring two parallel romantic relationships, both of which prove impossible to realise. I find it fascinating.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for this awesome reply to my question! 

The 'mysticism' you talk of in your first point - I'm not sure I agree if audiences enjoy that kind of ambiguity as much as you claim, although you do describe them as 'feigning' a deep connection to a film like *Tree Of Life*, so maybe you are hinting there's an element of pretentiousness at play? Is this a large general audience, or a smaller *truefilm* audience of cineastes? Personally I very much enjoy feeling mystified by a film - connecting with a film on an abstract level but not really knowing what it's about. But I don't consider my tastes in any way populist when it comes to film!

I actually flat out disagree with your third point, that the CGI in *Pi* failed to transcend the medium. I saw the film in 3D on an enormous screen and pretty much *forgot* the tiger wasn't real. And no matter how impressive the CGI in *Tree Of Life* was, the episode where a dinosaur experienced a moment of divine empathy was one of the funniest things I've seen in the cinema for a long time. 

I would add the thought that 'flashy' need not confine itself to effects and action. Malick consistently ups the flash quota outrageously in the casting of his films, to the point where you have a huge star like Sean Penn wandering around from time to time doing little else than *being Sean Penn* (this was pretty hilarious to me too). This is the most superficial variety of flash I can think of. While Lee will include movie stars in his films, he keeps it relatively modest, and enjoys casting unknowns in major roles. 

You may have worked out by now that I despise Malick - although this is an area where I bow to his popularity elsewhere. The films must be good; they are just not to my personal taste. On the other hand, I greatly admire Lee. I enjoy his unique and confusing identity - a little bit Chinese - a little bit western - a little bit block buster - a little bit art house etc. I admire his ability to create really thrilling multiplex-friendly action, while at the same time creating narratives that always carry an equally thrilling intellectual thesis. I love the way he surprises me - *Crouching Tiger*, for example, was a film about love that turned out to be a film about patriarchy. *Ride With The Devil* was a film about American identity that turned out to be a film about race. Sometimes there's a moment in his films where I suddenly realise what Lee is really doing and, seriously, it brings tears to my eyes. 

And yet I didn't include one of Lee's films on my own top ten list - so maybe the only person that can answer my original question is me. Maybe I really am just a snob.

<TEXT>  Most of the time we watch films about characters going on journeys, but sometimes films can take us on a journey too.

This is a great way of thinking about it! My problem with our (I include myself) slightly arms-length attitude to Ang Lee, however, is that I believe his best work does *both* of those things. *Crouching Tiger* or *Lust Caution* are, I would argue, just as rich in their subtextual themes as *Tree Of Life*. *Crouching Tiger*, for example, remains a poignant meditation on the eternal conflict between personal freedom and our need for romantic attachments - all viewed from a thrillingly post-feminist perspective. The intellectual exercise Lee demonstrates in that movie is, for me, equally as dazzling as the martial arts choreography! It's easily up there with the best of our 'top tens'. But at the same time *Crouching Tiger* was *so* popular, and is *so* easy to watch. My question is, does this popularity and ease keep us from appreciating the true value of Lee's work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your comment

 Personally, if all I'm getting is a cause-effect story

I don't think any of the movies in question, obviously narrative led or otherwise, are of this kind. Would a purely 'cause-effect story' movie even be possible? The audience would surely quickly start to impose their own subtext to the piece, probably without even realising it. 

But a lot of times, the most accessible work is the least specific or memorable. Mentioning Lust, Caution as your favorite Ang Lee film goes along with that - it received an NC-17 rating I believe and is likely his least seen film of this century.

Are you not confusing 'accessible' with 'popular' here? When I used the term 'accessible' I did not mean *physically* accessible (as in the film is easy to find), but that the film is 'easy to watch' in that the strong traditional narrative provides a familiar form a large audience will feel comfortable with.

<TEXT> I think your brief description of *TWBB* kind of describes what I mean. If someone were to ask you 'what's *TWBB* about?' you would probably have to think for a while before coming up with your answer. And if you asked many people, there would probably be many different answers. This is probably what makes it an interesting film. Compare this to *Life Of Pi* - the answer would probably start with something like 'well, this guy gets stuck on a boat with a tiger and...'. It's just a slightly easier narrative to access. Yes, you could, with some thought, go on to construct a far more sophisticated description of *Life Of Pi* which included the film's subtextual themes, but the basic 'guy on a boat with a tiger' thing would still stand. But *TWBB is* a narrative led movie in an obvious way - it does have a story (this guy discovers oil in the californian dessert...) which the majority of an audience will easily access. The differences are subtle.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The best of the 21st C lists and Ang Lee. Are we uncomfortable with 'story'? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-29 01:30:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was chatting to a friend at work about the TrueFilm 21st century poll, going over my top ten choices and mentioning some of the other popular choices, as well as those that made the final top ten. This work friend is highly intelligent, but while she enjoys the cinema she's not a 'serious' film fan. She commented that many of the films I had mentioned seemed to lack a strong 'story', and she wondered if too obvious or dominant a story-line was something that discouraged film enthusiasts from considering a film 'great'. 

I have to admit I find this an interesting question. I have not seen all of the films on the top ten, but if those I have, only the animation *Spirited Away* contains what I'd describe as a strong traditional narrative. *Mulholland Drive* and *Synecdoche* are narrative heavy it's true - but in so c-rrazy a manner, to call them 'narrative led' becomes highly problematic. *There Will Be Blood*, *Lost In Translation*, and *In The Mood* downplay their narratives, while *Tree Of Life* barely has one. (To be clear, I'm very much talking about the literal sur-text here. Obviously these films contain rich and compelling narratives on an abstract level.) 

The whole thing got me to thinking about Ang Lee, and possible explanations as to why this award winning, critically lauded movie-making giant failed to feature once on my and so many other's lists. Lee occupies a unique position, making contemporary films many would class as 'great', and yet sitting in strangely awkward company with the somehow more easily adored auteurs of our time such as Anderson and Malick. The 21st Century has seen not only the barnstorming *Crouching Tiger* from Lee, but the monumental *Life Of Pi* and also the film I would suggest as his best of the century so far, the staggeringly beautiful *Lust Caution*. 

Is the near absence of Lee on our lists, I wonder, somehow connected to his tendency to feature such solid, effortlessly accessible narratives at the forefront of his work? Is there something 'old fashioned' about a good story? If a film is too easy to access, does this put us off? 

Thoughts. 

(I use Lee only as an example to explain my question - so please feel free to make general comments on the subject of narrative apart from Lee) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The crew are entirely maintained by the technology that surrounds them - maintained but also controlled; made passive. In their inhuman environment, what we think of as 'human' qualities and traits are largely disabled, e.g. the human trait of communality and bonds between individuals (including bonds within the family group). In the future world of 2001, human endeavour generally has become subservient to the mechanisms of commerce - as exemplified by fact that Dr. Poole's birthday message from his parents is dominated almost entirely by talk of monetary transactions; salary; birthday gifts ets. In this way we can see Poole's emotionless reaction as entirely appropriate. His parents talk of nothing but money.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP is, I believe, highlighting *Inside Out* here because of its innovative approach to narrative, so the argument is not so much whether or not *Inside Out* is a good film, but about the originality of the narrative approach. *Inside Out* is not one of Pixar's greatest, but whether you love them or not, I find it hard to buy an argument that suggests they have failed to provide anything in the way of originality when it comes to the kinds of narrative we find in family entertainment. (This is another important feature of Pixar I think you miss - these are *family* films, not *children's* films.) *Wall-E*? 

I agree that *Inside Out*, while appearing to be strikingly original from the outside, is, when you break it down, pretty formulaic, and I question OP's inclusion of it in a list of narrative groundbreakers along with *Nashville*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Thin Red Line* was the start of his love affair with big hollywood stars, and for me the beginning of an ego-heavy bombasticism in his films. I remember Clooney's scene as being completely upstaged by the fact of Clooney's fame. There was no point to such a famous actor being in the film for so short a time - it's just ego.

<TEXT> This is an interesting question! There are some directors, like Kubrick maybe, who strove endlessly for perfection in their work. It's an exhausting and laborious way to go about things, but when it work the results can be awesome. Maybe I'm giving away too much of how my strange mind works here - but I see it as kind of a 'masculine' approach to art (yeh I know - makes no sense probably). Other directors - including some I've come to greatly admire over the past decade - seem to seek to exert minimal control over their films. They know, perhaps, that a work of art does not belong to the artist, and is not 'finished' until it's seen by an audience. The audience completes the film. (Or maybe, since a film is a recording that in theory can exist for eternity, a film is never completely finished, because it can always continue to be seen by different audiences!). These directors are like good parents to their work. They create films and guide them, but ultimately they know their creation will have a life of its own, and they encourage them to take on their own identity. The french director Arnaud Desplechin springs to mind - he makes huge rambling films that sometimes vary wildly in style and tone. It's almost as if he's intentionally making his work as messy as possible, so that the very idea of 'perfection' is quickly forgotten and we can all relax and enjoy the ride. There's something modest about this style - the work is no longer about the director's ego perhaps! I will always love Kubrick, but too much of him and I feel weighed down by the ego of the man! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you just don't *like* Malick. Without meaning to sound flippant, for me he is one of the most overrated directors of our time. I'm all about Anderson - all about Haneke - all about Weerasethakul - from Kurosawa to Kiarostami I'm down with the heavy-weights, but Malick leaves me stone cold. I found *Tree Of Life* hard to watch. Towards the end I kept trying to catch the eye of other people in the cinema audience to see if I was alone in my incredulity - such a deeply pretentious film! If you want to f*** your Mother that bad, go to therapy. Don't make a film about it. (Just to balance this out, obviously *Badlands* rocks, and I thought *Days Of Heaven* a monumentally beautiful film.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Bottled cherry tomato confit - storage shelf life? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-15 16:53:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here in the UK we're coming to the end of tomato season, so today at the market I bought a huge bag of beautiful cherry tomatoes - yellow, orange, red, black - they are so pretty! My plan was to confit them in oil and then store in jars to enjoy over the winter. I've made confit toms before, but I've always eaten them within two weeks, and I have just realised my recipe (and any others I can find online) doesn't recommend this method for longer term storage. One recipe does suggest drying the toms first, which will make them last longer in oil in storage jars - but it's unclear *how* long the shelf life would be. I don't want to be eating the toms at christmas - but a month would be a good time to keep them for me. Any experience of this/ thoughts to share? THanks in advance!  </TEXT>

I only saw the film once. Am I over-estimating this movie? Has it become better in my memory than it really is? At the time I considered it an important American film with something vital to say about contemporary life. I also thought it's execution was superb. Any thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello - can anyone help me with my question?

Background: For about two years I've been daily fasting, eating only between 3pm and 9pm every day. On my work out days I've been going to the gym around 2pm, working out on an empty stomach and eating afterwards. I'm going with the research that suggests working out on an empty stomach works well for men and increases testosterone.

Question: Because of my work schedule I'd like to change my workout time to the morning, probably around 10am. I'm worried about working out at this time on an empty stomach and then not eating till 3pm. I don't think I could handle that. Will my body adjust, and even if it does, is this a good idea anyway?

Thanks in advance for any replies.

Edit: My fasting routine is purely for general health benefits - I'm a 45 yr old man and am not fasting to improve results from the gym. This is a very general fitness question.

Why did I discard these films in later drafts? I'm not sure why myself. Although I believe them to be stand out films (comedies or otherwise) of the 21stC, I could not class them as 'great' films along with *Amour* and *The Act Of Killing*. But even as I type that it doesn't sound very convincing. I'm stumped.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK I'll make this short as possible. Second attempt at D Lebovitz's Chocolate Dulce de Leche tart (Recipe halfway down [this](http://blog.williams-sonoma.com/what-were-reading-my-paris-kitchen/) page). Making my own Dulce de Leche from goats milk. First attempt at tart OK but overbaked - too solid and cracked and dull on top. Second attempt - looks awesome, shiny and just set out of oven, so very excited - let it cool for about one hour - cut into it and the Dulce de leche starts to trickle out onto the table! Ten minutes later the Dulce de leche has vacated the tart completely. The chocolate part of the tart and the pastry are awesome and delicious. Now here'e the part that confuses me - when I made the dulce de leche and allowed it to cool it was *very* firm, and after a night in the fridge it was a struggle to get it out the bowl. At no point since it was made - warm, cool, or chilled, has it been runny enough to run and pool over a table top. So how on earth did this happen to my tart? I need this tart to work for me because it is **off the scale** delicious. Any ideas? Was it something to do with the goats milk (first time round I used cows). The recipe is for shop bought dulce de leche but I have never seen it in a shop and I doubt the ready made kind could compete with the home-made goats milk variety - it's just lovely!  </TEXT>

Yes I do expect perfection in a book. I expect every word to be absolutely perfectly correct. Cookbooks don't have that many words in them.

<TEXT> How about one of my favourite cookery writers, David Lebovitz? His entire persona is a kind of 'I make this in my own kitchen' vibe. I'd be very disappointed if he wasn't as hands-on as he seems. When one of his recipes continues to fail after repeated attempts (has only happened once or twice) I get really stressed out! I love the recipes of Michel Roux Snr, and especially his little books 'Pastry' and 'Sauces' etc - but it's taken me years to admit these books contain several mistakes in the quantities, eg giving you double quantities for a pie filling. The British chef Mark Hix is another favourite of mine, but just this evening I followed a recipe of his that began 'melt half the butter in a pan...', and then failed to mention what you do with the other half of the butter!! People are saying 'it's not as easy as you think' but come on, that stuff is basic surely! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry if this is not an appropriate topic - mods please tell me I'll delete. I tend to find cookery writers that I really love and stick with them - but I get so terribly disappointed when one of their recipes just doesn't work, I have a hard time accepting the recipe is a dud. I usually assume it's down to my lack of skill, so I'll try the recipe multiple times, usually researching the dish to see if there's anything I'm doing wrong. Sometimes I end up getting it right, but sometimes I have to abandon the recipe because it obviously just doesn't work. This tends to put me off the writer in question and I end up 'divorcing' them and moving on to someone else! All over one single dud recipe! Anyone else ever feel 'betrayed' by a favourite writer? It upsets me when a recipe obviously hasn't been tested all that vigorously, or just written badly with vital information left out (this happens quite often I find!). Not to mention recipes that contain obvious mistakes. I mean, how hard can writing a recipe *be*?  </TEXT>

It depresses me that he has become such a technical director, making these highly polished, technically superb, but utterly soulless films. They're both boring and overblown, and he can only get away with it because of his celebrity. I feel the same about Spielberg. These directors have chosen such a lazy, self indulgent direction to take their 'late' work. But hey - he's Martin Scorsese and he has made some of the most staggeringly brilliant movies of the last 50 years, so I guess he can do what ever he wants! He could make another 20 dismal movies and he would still be awesome.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So does a director's public persona (or lack of one) influence how you think of their films (if at all)? 

Yes I think it definitely does. With a big celebrity like Tarantino an audience is going to have specific expectations before they go and see the movie. They're adding to information they already have from previous films and from the director's media celebrity; continuing a conversation. You can't un-experience this conversation, so you have a context already in place which makes it impossible to see the movie as if the converstaion had never happened. But this is especially true with Tarantino as his movies are really just self-promotion for his brand. Hitchcock is another example of a director who used his celebrity persona to promote his films. 

The downside of this is that celebrity directors can continue to attract audiences to substandard work just because of their celebrity. IMO Scorsese is an example of this. *Shutter Island* was a **Scorsese movie** and I think it's becomes difficult for an audience to see how bad a movie is when a big part of their minds are assuming it's great just because it's Scorsese.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes - it's such a subjective thing isn't it! For me, I don't really know what moral questions is raises. I read the film as a satire on the hypocrisy of ruling elites. It pokes a lot of fun at human beings and human society, but I can't see a moral question there. I think Malcom McDowel does indeed give a highly charismatic performance in the lead role - but ultimately his character is merely a cypher. The film makes no comment or judgement on him - all commentary is made on the characters that surround Alex and react to his behaviour. Some of the humour reminds me of *Carry On* films, which I personally detest! I find the initial violence in the film (especially the attack on the Alexanders) and Alex's character disturbing - nothing wrong with this of course but I can not bring myself to find the film funny after this initial violent sequence. Much is made of the 'artificiality' of the violence in *Clockwork Orange*, and for the most part this is true. The murder of the 'cat lady' for example is unrealistic and pretty funny in a way. The same is not true of the rape of Mrs. Alexander. This attack is too realistic for me to laugh at anything in the rest of the film, and in fact I find the jokes immature and in bad taste. But as I said - it's all very subjective! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking as a huge admirer of Kubrick, *Lolita* is one that left me completely cold. I put it in a catagory along with *Barry Lyndon* and *Clockwork Orange* of Kubrick films that just don't work. Something very basic these films have in common is they are all far too long. *Lolita* is rambling in structure and uneven in tone - by the end of it you feel like you've seen at least three movies. Kubrick was a master of what I call the 'environmental protagonist' - that is, a place (a building or location) that carries enormous charisma and becomes a dominant player in the drama. There are a few good examples, but the most obvious is the hotel in *The Shining*. His work excels when one or more strong environmental protagonists are present. *Lolita* doesn't have one, and in my opinion the absence of an environmental protagonist always causes Kubrick to lose focus.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Match Point is a better film than Crimes and Misdemeanors.

You crazy renegade you. Anyway, I have slept on it and this morning I thought of the best example I can give of a film that genuinely challenged me on an intellectual level and caused me to allow a point of view I would usually find obnoxious. It's *Viridiana*, the 1961 film by Luis Bunuel. If you haven't seen it, take a look. It totally pulls the rug from under an audience's feet on the intellectual level, taking an almost Randian turn towards the end that sends shivers down the spine. Bunuel expounds upon the hypocrisy of charity - empathy is a charade! I have volunteered for various charities over the years and this is a tricky POV to present to me in a favourable light, but Bunuel pulls it off. But then he was a genius. 

Edit: thought of a second example: *The Decline Of The American Empire*, Denys Arcand 1986. This film leads its audience to question the concept of knowledge itself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A-ha! We part ways! For me, *Husbands And Wives* is Allen at his brutalist best - so breathtakingly cold it made my eyes water. Perhaps not a film for your 20s - I mean you shouldn't have to know that shit till you're at least 37. Till then, why spoil things? But this discussion is for another thread.....!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get you. If I think of any really good ones I will let you know! I am sceptical though, still suspecting that films we respond to positively on an intellectual level are usually those that reinforce opinions we already had, or at were at least in the process of developing. I connect particularly with Assayas because cultural theory is an interest of mine, and very few films engage with cultural theory as openly as his. A very good and very clever friend of mine thought *Sils Maria* was 'pretentious rot'. 

PS. If *Annie Hall* challenged your youthful romanticism, what on earth did you make of *Husbands And Wives*? Maybe you will have to wait till you're 48 to get in line with that one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmmmm... not sure about your examples as some of them sound like films you *learned* something from, or that opened your eyes to something you hadn't previously considered. A film can teach us something or even alter our perspective slightly without necessarily 'challenging' us - that is presenting us with intellectual material we disagree with, but ultimately persuading us to allow sympathy for an opposing POV. Sounds like *Raising Arizona* is your best example after all. I would love a film to do this for me - probably my original example of *Clouds Of Sils Maria* is the best I can do. It took what is, for me, an intensely frightening and depressing cultural progression, and gave it an upbeat. But I would love for a film to challenge me politically. As a life-long lefty, I would like to see a film that allows me to consider right wing views with sympathy. As a lapsed capitalist maybe you are the one to write the screenplay! Get on it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not OP, but I actually think *The Matrix* is a great example of a film that provides an unambiguous intellectual experience. It's a very rare type of film - both wildly popular and containing a strong intellectual allegory that is universally understood - so much so that it has become a kind of cultural touchstone. If I say in conversation 'Shit - It's just like *The Matrix*!', everyone knows exactly what I'm talking about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I get where OP is coming from - and I'm impressed by the breakdown of audience experience suggested. With the risk of misinterpreting - to give a simple example, a narrative-led film might be most easily discovered in the murder-mystery or thriller genres. A simple TV 'who done it' would be a good example of a purely narrative-led form. Perhaps Hitchcock may be suggested with a film such as *Strangers On A Train*? But in the cinema it's rare to find such a simple example, and most films contain a combination of all the 'types' of audience experience OP is suggesting. It's a question on emphasis.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It's the questions that are interesting, and questions don't necessarily need answers.

Yes I very much agree! This is what I think Durkin achieves in *Martha Marcy May Marlene*. He asks a very difficult question and that is all - the ending is inconclusive. 

But in your description of an imagined narrative about American democracy, you suggest a kind of 'catch all' approach, where a spectrum of points of view are included so that a wide audience is engaged. But you then suggest the film has a thesis. Doesn't a thesis require a judgement call? At some point, doesn't the story-teller need to come down (even softly) on one side or the other of an argument? And will this not alienate to some extent the portion of the audience that disagrees? 

Can you think of an example of a film that has changed your mind on an intellectual level - or challenged your beliefs in a constructive way?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this question! It's so interesting. 

Personally I love the feeling when I leave the cinema that I've connected with a film on an intellectual level. I do have questions about that experience however. When that happens powerfully, is it not often the case that the intellectual narrative we've enjoyed is probably something that aligns with a narrative we more or less agree with - or with something we were thinking about/ have thought about anyway? Is there a danger that the film has merely been 'preaching to the choir', and what is the worth in this experience? 

I also believe this kind of connection with a film is almost never universal, and individuals in an audience will respond in radically different ways. Maybe the 'levelling' effect we can enjoy by way of an emotional narrative (*everybody* in the audience was crying!) indicates that it is on an emotional level that most human beings are similar - where as intellectuals we inhabit relatively niche little planets!

Anyway, from the perspective of my own niche little planet (!), I have recently felt a deep and quite exhilarating intellectual connection with two films by the french director Olivier Assayas - *Summer Hours* (2008) and *Clouds Of Sils Maria* (2014). Without going into detail, Assayas in these films takes a brave, open and honest look at the fault line between what we might think of as 'old' and 'new' culture. Culturally speaking, technology has changed the world almost beyond recognition in a very short space of time, and for some of us who grew up in the 'old' culture this is pretty terrifying. It is easy for us to fall back into a 'modern life is rubbish' attitude - to assume the 'old' way was better; authentic! Where is authenticity in the age of the internet? Especially in *Clouds Of Sils Maria*, Assayas creates a thrilling meta-narrative in the casting of Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart as the leads - surely a decision that raised eyebrows among cineasts the world over! But when you see the film, the casting makes total sense, and you realise that Assayas is a very, *very* clever man. (The 'meta-narrative' effect spins into orgasmic post-modern delirium with the further casting of Chloe Grace Moretz - someone I had not even heard of.) The wonderful thing about these films is that they are *not* bitter - they do not simply damn contemporary culture are wallow in nostalgia for the old ways. They manage to find a way forward - they end with hope for the future, which both surprised and inspired me. At the end of *Sils Maria*, for example, Binoche's character - previously so appalled and dismissive of splintered, pluralist internet culture and of the creative direction popular cinema is taking - is defeated. But in defeat she discovers a re-birth - she simply submits to the new world, she gives in - and you know what? It's OK. Everything is OK. It doesn't matter - give up! This is what I took from the film! It sounds nihilist - but it is far from nihilist. It is  constructive - positive - and beautiful. 

I must put in a word also for Sean Durkin's brilliant *Martha Marcy May Marlene* (2011) which I felt was grappling with an absolutely central contemporary issue of how we live our lives in a secular capitalist society - there was something absolutely vital about this film's intellectual thesis. (Sean - *make another movie please*!).

<TEXT> This is such an interesting question. As well as film, I have an interest in theatre, and it's always struck me how differently the two forms work in this respect. *Very* generally speaking, film is good at constructing heroic characters that function as gods in a way (objects we can worship), where theatre is good at exposing would-be heroic characters and demonstrating that all human beings are flawed. So a character like Atticus Finch in *To Kill A Mocking Bird* could only really work on film, where Willy Loman in *Death Of A Salesman* only really works on stage. Having said all that, *most* films sit somewhere in the grey area in between.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry I'm pasting the same reply to another comment! ;

Thanks for your reply. I'm following Michel Roux Snr's recipe for apricot tart from his Pastry book. According to the recipe, the pastry case is unbaked, you fill it with the pastry cream (already cooked - unless this is a variation he fails to mention in the recipe), put the fruit on top and bake the whole thing for 40 minutes. I usually make it with ordinary pastry cream, but to be honest it's pretty hit and miss. Sometimes the fruit produces a lot of juice as it cooks, and this seems to split the pastry cream just a little bit (still delicious - but not the pastry cream of my dreams). The double cream was an experiment, because as much as I adore a fruit tart, I just don't *love* traditional pastry cream. I will not try this again though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello askculinites. 

So I'm working on pastry cream at the moment and it's very hit and miss. I like the idea of adding whipped double (heavy) cream to pastry cream because.... well I like the idea of adding heavy cream to anything truth be known. My question is - if I add the cream, can I still use the resulting pastry cream mix as a filling for a fruit tart that is then to be baked? I've tried it once and it was a disaster - the filling did not cook and set so much as it rose and boiled over! I guess when you alter the proportions of the pastry cream this might happen? Is the creamy version really only good for filling pre-baked pastry as in eclairs etc? Any thoughts/experience to share? :-) </TEXT>

My problem still stands I'm afraid - even 45 minutes on the stove does not cook my chicken. I think it's the chicken I'm using to be honest. That particular recipe I have had success with by braising the chicken in the oven for around an hour after the browning. :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello great minds of AskCulinary. 
Recipes that require you to cook chicken pieces on the stove top. 
This never works for me. Often the recipe will say 'cook the chicken for 20 - 25 minutes', but in my experience chicken pieces take *much* longer than that to cook. I'm in the UK here - is it possible we just like our chicken to be well done, where other countries don't mind it rare? I *love* rare meat - but not rare chicken! Or could it be the kind of chicken I'm using? I buy free-range organic chicken from the local farmer's market - often a cockerel because I think they taste better. The legs and thighs of these birds are often dense and can be *large*. Am I answering my own question here....?

Edit: sorry should have been clearer - by chicken pieces I'm talking legs and thighs, not the breasts. 

Further edit: [Example of what I mean](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/recipes/chicken-mustard-poulet-la-moutarde/14048/) - OK so when you add the browning time to the cooking time you get 40 - 45 minutes, but even this leaves my chicken nowhere near cooked through! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anderson's *Magnolia*, *The Master*, and *Inherent Vice* certainly question the human condition and search for an authenticity of experience I would associate with existentialist concerns. And if we're being picky I would in return strongly question your assertion that Kiarostami's character's treat life, people, and their surrounding world with care and respect. 

Woody Allen's work I was thinking of would be films like *Crimes And Misdemeanors*, *Another Woman*, and *Husbands And Wives*. Apart from that there are quite a few individual films I would suggest. Farara's *Bad Lieutenant*, Sean Durkin's *Martha Marcy May Marlene*, and Pialat's 1987 film *Sous Le Soleil De Satan*. Perhaps that most challenging film I've seen for years that deeply explores the human condition is Oppenheimer's *The Act Of Killing*.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Slow/potroasting blues </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-12 20:32:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Good people of AskCulinary. I have a question about slow roasting/ slow potroasting. 

When I have a joint of meat that requires a long and slow roast (the joint that prompted this question was a shoulder of venison) recipes I look up as a guide usually tell me to set the oven at around 160c (320f). Cooking times can vary from 2 to usually around 4 hours. On checking the roast after about 90 minutes, however, I often find any liquid that I've added to the pot bubbling pretty confidently. Now if I was attempting to slow cook something on the hob this kind of bubbling boil would prompt me to turn the heat *right* down immediately. For meat that needs very gentle treatment my instinct wants me to find a heat that has any stock barely moving - maybe sending up a bubble every now and then to let you know there's something happening. This, it seems to me, would require an oven temperature more like 125c (255f). But the recipes always give 160. I should add I'm quite often a little disatisfied with the joint in question, and can't help thinking - this would have been much nicer in a much lower oven for much longer. Should I just defy the recipes and go with my instinct on this? Any advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wowzer - that's quite a find! I would say go chronologically and be prepared for some highs and lows. Just IMO of course, not all of Bergman has aged all that well. I have been disappointed by some of the iconic 'masterpieces', and pleasantly surprised by some of the 'lesser' films. The great stuff is still great though. *Wild Strawberries* is, for me, one of cinema's most precious treasures. When you've got through them all finish the Bergman-a-thon with *Fanny And Alexander*. It sums everything up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really like the movies of French director Arnaud Desplechin. Two of his best are *Ma Vie Sexuelle* (1996) and *Rois et Riene* (2004). They run at 180 minutes and 150 minutes respectively. His action skips along at quite a pace.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can see that it's a seduction scene. Probably Mamet chose to frame the Lingk/Roma storyline that way to emphasise the irresistable charisma and the manipulative power of the Roma character - like he probably *could* seduce the guy into bed. He could persuade anyone to do anything! But the term 'latent homosexuality' is too strong. It's taking a metaphor and making it something literal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Naomi Watts isn't on my list of greatest actors, but she's wonderful in *MD*! Now I'm no fool and I watch a *lot* of movies - but when that movie switches realities about two thirds of the way through, I *did not realise* that was still Naomi Watts. I thought that was a totally different actress. I'm kind of embarrassed about that now, but hopefully I was just completely absorbed in the movie (which I totally *was*) and my brain bought the reality switch hook line and sinker!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry to post twice on this - I find it really interesting and I thought of something else I'd like to add. I'm thinking about the films of David Lynch. It seems to me he seeks out and encourages OTT performances from actors that are always teetering on the brink of camp. I'm thinking Laura Dern in *Blue Velvet* and *Wild At Heart*, Naomi Watts in *Mullholland Drive*, and also Sheryl Lee in *Fire Walk With Me*. You could add many other Lynch performances to this list. Lynch is known as a maverick auteur of course, but perhaps his direction of actors is underrated because those performances are often of the style OP describes. There is a beauty in these performances I think is sometimes overlooked. Cheryl Lee in *Fire Walk* - what an extraordinary job she does there. An absolute emotional roller coaster of a role that requires her to dedicate herself completely. There is always the danger with these examples that the actor will end up looking completely ridiculous - just think of the action Lynch demands of them! But they appear fearless, and they do a sensational job. Do they deserve more credit for their work with Lynch? From memory I can't think of Lynch movies that have won a ton of rewards for acting (please correct me). Maybe the style is just too wierd for mainstream acclaim.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The mechanism of cinema is, at its core, populist. The primary function of cinema is to make money by entertaining the masses. What we think of as 'art cinema' is an offshoot of popular cinema. Although the cross-overs between the two schools are many and the grey areas so vast as to make the distinctions near irrelevant, it could still be argued that very generally art cinema's principle goals are not to make money by entertaining the masses. Film critics and lists of 'greatest films' tend to focus either on art cinema, or on populist films from long enough ago to have earned them the status of 'classics'. I fall into this trap myself. I love *Die Hard*, but I've never considered putting it on my greatest films list next to *Wild Strawberries*. But does *Die Hard* really contain less artistry than *Wild Strawberries*? This is a constant and fascinating fault line that exists in cinema more than in any other art form - possibly because cinema is one of the worlds most lucrative creative industries.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My reply to this question is boring, but I think the truth of the matter is there are as many types of artists as there are people. Probably there is no universal quality that makes for a great artist. Arguably the 20th Century's greatest playwright and towering example of creative integrity Arthur Miller had a son with down syndrome he kept secret from the world and rarely visited. Honesty, at least in a kind of 'blanket' sense, is not prerequisite to high achievement in the arts. Talent is all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi wonderfully helpful people of AskCulinary. 
I'm on a preserving kick at the moment and am planning to move from fruits into meat, starting with a confit rabbit. Recipes for this are not many (quite a lot on youtube, but not much detail) and those there are vary wildly in terms of salting times/ cooking times/ storing period. My main question is this: Can I confit and bottle rabbit pieces as I would fruit? That is, once safely sealed in a kilner jar, can my rabbit confit be stored in the pantry, or is it always for the fridge? Anyone have experience with this? I expect to mess it up a few times before I get it right.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ha! I know what you mean. I've been going to yoga classes for eight years, so I have practiced this quite a lot! I think that if you are extremely infexible in one specific way, sometimes people just *don't get it* because their hips and hamstrings (in my case) basically come from a different planet than yours. It's like they can't even *think* themselves into the body of someone who literally can't sit upright when in wide leg pose. Just today in fact I watched a video on youtube about how to do seated forward folds for 'very stiff people'. Well the 'very stiff person' was sitting upright quite happily and doing all that stuff like 'lifting the buttock flesh back with the hands' and 'turning the thigh flesh outwards'. If I do anything with my hands other than support my weight at the back I fall over! People often say 'really root your sit bones to the ground'. Mine are never rooted to the ground because my pelvis is tilted back and I'm using my abs to keep me upright - fighting gravity rather than using it! To be honest I've always suspected it's to do with the shape and/or angle of my pelvis. I'm quite wide hipped and have long thin legs and quite a small rib cage - there's something about my build that doesn't even *look* like it should be flexible! Standing forward folds are no problem - I enjoy them, but of course you've got a whole lot of gravity helping you out there. My challenge is as much to deal with the 'dread' I have of this pose more than anything else. I don't need to be flexible to enjoy my yoga - but I dislike the worry that maybe this next class is going to focus on seated straight-leg poses, and the horrible sinking feeling when I find out it is! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks. I will be mindful of what my tailbone is doing next time I'm trying this pose. It is such a challenge for me - I always need to put my hands on the ground behind me after just a short time. I find I can end up spending long (or they *feel* long) periods simply sitting up in this position while the rest of the class are involved in various progressions. I must admit I get self conscious on this situation - where elsewhere I'm very happy to work at my own level despite what my neighbour might be doing. I guess this is such an obvious one - one guy simply struggling to sit upright for so long! </TEXT>

So is my bottom sitting right on the edge of the blankets? Will this not encourage my tailbone to angle toward my feet? Elsewhere I am reading that I should try to angle my tailbone the other way.

<TEXT> Hmmm - maybe I shouldn't have used the word 'male'. But I saw a clip of a Connery Bond on TV not long ago - think it might have been *Goldfinger* - poolside - Bond is getting a massage from pretty lady - someone arrives to talk to him and he slaps the girl on the ass and says 'run along now, the men have to talk'. The girl enjoys it and turns to give him a flirtatious smile. It's all just incredibly embarrassing and kind of sickening tbh. And I don't think this is a female fantasy! And these days? No - men are not allowed to have those fantasies. Well, they can *have* them of course! But they shouldn't ask us to celebrate them in a public forum. *Yes of course* these things don't happen in contemporary Bond films - but *this is the baggage they're constantly trying to offload*. It's just wearisome.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> wide angle seated poses - how can I overcome the dread?? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-17 13:03:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi - my first question here so apologies if it's been asked a billion times which it no doubt has. I've been practicing yoga for about 8 years or so - classes at my local centre 2/3 times a week. I love it! 

I have a tough time though, both mentally and physically, with wide angle seated poses (well - all straight-leg seated poses, but especially wide angled ones). My body just does not sit that way - it feels like something my pelvis/hips just does not want me to do. It's never painful, but tbh I have a real struggle even to sit up with wide angle legs. I'm the guy at the back of the class with his chin tucked down into his chest and his arms stretched out like he's trying to grab onto the end of a rope, while people around me flop over and rest their foreheads on the floor!

Of course there are loads of other yoga poses I struggle with (I'm not a naturally flexible guy), but I'm happy to work away at my own level with these and have learned 'steps towards' the poses that feel right for *me*. Yoga has a mental/emotional level for me which is to do with self kindness and finding your own level of challenge - this is why I love yoga! But this wide-angle seated pose - it fills me with dread! Some classes focus on it - and I *hate* those. My heart sinks!

How can I find a way to challenge myself with kindness in this pose? The problem is there seem to be few 'steps towards' this pose for someone who is unable even to sit upright with his legs wide. I have asked teachers about it but usually they advise working on simply stretching to make myself more flexible - something I have done, but I don't think they appreciate just how hard this pose is for me. Any help appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really think horror films *are* dismissed by 'serious' film fans or critics. The genre continues to be enjoyed by millions and is as alive and well as ever (as far as I can see - I'm not a horror fan so I'm looking at this from the outside). 

I think the distinction you make between horror and what we loosely think of as 'arthouse' (whatever that is) can be made between arthouse and other film genres - for example action movies or romcom. Action, horror, romcom - while there are of course cross-over examples (*The Shining* springs to mind) the majority of films that identify with these labels have a primary goal which is, whatever else they might do, to thrill and to entertain. To thrill and entertain was not the primary goal of Bergman's most iconic work. It's simply a question of identities, and I think even the most refined cineaste would admit there are great examples from most schools of film making. I, for example, am pretty much a hardcore arthouse fanatic, but every time I watch *Die Hard* I have to admit the film is a stone cold masterpiece. All I'm saying is that Horror is a populist form - it's in its DNA. 

I think there *are* some 'serious', well respected film artists who have explored similar territory to Horror, but because of their creative background we don't immediately see their work that way. Lars Von Trier, for example, in something like *Antichrist* is, to me, making a 'horror' movie of sorts. But we don't think of it that way because the film is simply not selling itself so - neither in its marketing nor really in its creative objectives. But the territory it explores could easily be that of a 'horror' movie. I would say the same of some of Haneke. And of course Tarantino.  

I should point out that, as with all creative activity, there are big grey areas in my argument. It's this that makes the question interesting to me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They should give it up - it's about 40 years past its 'use by' date. James Bond is a male fantasy that is completely innapropriate for our times. The only way producers can see round this is to have the character die inside and to start deconstructing the mythology from *within* said mythology. Clever - but the problem they are left with is that Bond inevitably stops enjoying his life, and when Bond stops enjoying his life so does the audience. Can we just move on? </TEXT>

But over the years I've struggled with many recipes that have told me to put butter and sugar into a pan and melt them together to 'make a caramel'. These are not random internet recipes, but proper recipes in books written by respected chefs. It never works. A while back I did some research and discovered that, according to scientific sources, sugar will not dissolve in fat. Is this true? And if so, WHY do so many recipes ask you to make caramel this way? This is a decades-old bugbear of mine.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Double cream/ whipping cream - general cream confusion </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-15 18:03:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi - first time posting here so apologies in advance if this isn't appropriate. 

My question is about the fat content of cream. I use Michel Roux Snr's recipes a lot (the man is a genius) but I find he is *very* heavy on the cream. I recently made his version of ham mousse, which called for 'whipping cream' - 800ml for 8 servings (see what I mean?). I was only able to get double cream (heavy cream in the US) and thought it was more or less the same thing. The mousse was not pleasant and tasted overwhelmingly of cream. Also after it was whipped the volume was huge and I ended up with enough mousse for 16. I have since found out there is a slight difference between whipping and double cream - but according to the internet this is only a few % fat content. Whipping cream, the internet tells me, is around 35% fat while double is 35 - 40%. I looked on my carton of double and the fat content was 48%. I find all this totally confusing. When following recipes should I adjust the amount of cream I use according to the fat content on the carton?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They don't have that much in common to be honest - except the films you mention lean heavily on montage to tell their stories. Perhaps what's rocking your boat is simply what I would call an 'abstract narrative' approach to film making. Without more knowledge of what you have or haven't seen, it's difficult to make recommendations, but some obvious ones (forgive me if they're too obvious) would be Tarkovsky's *Mirror*, Resnais' *Hiroshima Mon Amour*, and maybe a Werner Herzog like *Kaspar Hausser*. In films such as *The Double Life Of Veronique* and *Three Colours: Blue* Kieslowski is a match for Kar Wai's supremely stylish poetics. 

If you want to go all the way into poetic abstraction try a Weerasethakul like *Tropical Malady* or even *Man With A Movie Camera* (pure montage). 

Two of the films you mention, *Spirit Of The Beehive* and *In The Mood For Love* contain deeply obscured political content - both having been made during the watch of censor-happy regimes. Is the intensity this can inspire what is grabbing you? If so you might look at Kiarostami, especially *Taste Of Cherry*.  </TEXT>

Hipsters with an out-of-control sense of entitlement are just as likely to start texting or chatting to their friends during a film as some idiot down the multiplex who just doesn't know any better - in fact the former is *more* annoying because of this. Arrogance is more annoying than ignorance! If there's a film I *must* see at the cinema, I tend to favour the multiplex. I choose a week day matinee show.

<TEXT> I prefer to watch films in a cinema with a very quiet, very attentive audience. Unfortunately such audiences don't exist now, so I have stopped going to the cinema. A few years ago I worked as a film critic for a while and got to go to critics screenings. They were the best conditions to enjoy a film I have experienced - completely silent attentive audience. There *is* something special about watching a film with other people - it can be quite a different experience than watching alone. This is especially obvious in the case of comedy, but it applies elsewhere also. These days I only watch films alone at home, and that's a shame.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, one of Kubrick's flaws (big Kubrick fan here BTW) was his occasional misfire in the casting department. It possibly was a result of arrogance on his part - the idea that he could take *any* actor and make them great. It happened with Ryan O'Neil in *Barry Lyndon*, and (just IMO) *Eyes Wide Shut* is another example. I found the 'acting competition' taking place between Cruise and Kidman irritating to say the least. *This is gonna be MY movie you SOB!*

Apart from that I enjoy *Eyes Wide Shut*, but I don't think it's one of Kubrick's 'great' films. Just my personal take  here (people are sensitive about Kubrick - I have learned elsewhere on this sub!) - but for me Kubrick excelled at 'trapped' narratives. It's when his story was limited to two or three locations that he could really fly.

 As a story teller, Kubrick leaned toward allegory - and yet, frustratingly, he was not a great allegorist! His most allegorical films (*Clockwork Orange* for example) are dull. I would suggest *Eyes Wide Shut* is such an allegorical work. He was, primarily, a visual artist who was at his best when able to mastermind an entire visual language for his audience - that is to say, when he could control and design the details of his world. The less control he has, the less powerful the result. Therefore, his 'multi-location' films like *Eyes Wide Shut*, while having much to admire and enjoy, are never going to work as well as something like *The Shining* or *2001*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember this film vividly as I found it totally absorbing. I think it was a real 'zeitgeist' movie at the time, especially in France. It came at a time when France had just started to wake up to the social problems in its more diverse communities - usually exemplified by the troubled Parisian suburbs. It addressed an older generation's fear of disorder and a lack of respect in younger people, reinforced by the 'otherness' of ethnicity. It's worth remembering that France, while politically and ethically an extremely liberal country, can be culturally very conservative. 

The film was also extraordinary in the way it was developed. Based on a book written by a teacher describing his own experiences in a difficult school, the teacher ended up actually *starring* in the film, playing a version of himself (this is the main character). The younger actors were cast directly from similar real life schools, so basically there are almost *no* professional actors in the film. The authenticity this provides is a major feature of the film's success. 

The final scene, as I remember, was an optimistic attempt at a happy ending. It suggested that, despite everything, a positive future was possible for both the teacher and the pupils. 

If you enjoyed the movie definitely check out Cantet's other films because they are terrific, especially *Time Out* and *Human Resources*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi - been inspired by similar posts like this to write my own version.

So I'm kind of a lapsed cineaste. I've basically lost my mojo when it comes to film, which was once a passionate interest for me. I guess I've become bitter and cynical, believing the best movies have already been made. 

Me: I'm a big fan of cinema from the 80s and 90s - my 'top films' list is very busy during that period, but then gradually slacks off, till there is probably about one film added a year since 2010. Last films that made my list (I don't have an *actual* list - I'm speaking figuratively!) were probably *Amour* (2012) *Martha Marcy May Marlene* (2011) and *Syndromes And A Century* (2006) (this is to give you an idea of what kind of film making I like). My favourite directors are French - Maurice Pialat and Agnes Varda. I love (or loved) French cinema. Also love Kiarostami, Kubrick, Haneke, Tarkovsky, Anderson ... you get the picture. In addition to my highbrow tastes, I have a fondness for American comedies from the Apatow stable, as well as Pixar movies. *Hate* the likes of Nolan and Inarritu - *hate* 'mind bending' movies. *Hate* Tarantino with a passion! 

My question: given my movie profile, what film makers/ movements/ countries am I missing? What amazing contemporary films have I lost touch with? What movies can relight my fire?? Help me TrueFilmers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your comment. Yes they are related thematically. It could easily be a case of artists working on similar themes which are, admittedly, pretty universal. I think it was the structure of the two narratives - strictly episodic, often describing one fabulous social event after another - along with the central character of the journalist and his would-be romance that got me thinking there might be more than coincidence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have heard that but I haven't read the book so can't confirm. It's just a more cohesive film - and by cohesive I don't mean comprehensible exactly, I mean that structurally it feels more of a united whole than the Tarkovsky, which reads as disjointed to me. It's worth seeing - apart from anything else George Clooney is superb in the leading role.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Unless there was a similar post-war social "movement"(?) among aristocrats in Rome

Absolutely there was - I think the two periods are easily comparable. 1930 - 12 years after the end of the globally catastrophic Great War, 1960 - 15 years after the equally devastating second WW. It's something about a kind of societal search for meaning after events so terrible they would naturally lead a new generation to ask 'what's it all about'? I think the world was a uniquely unsettling place for these postwar generations. I interpret their hedonism as a form of depression - a cry for help.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure I'm feeling the similarities as strongly as you. Both works are satirising the futility and dehumanising nature of warfare. Therefore they are sure to have much in common. Could you make a similar comparison with Kurt Vonnegut's *Slaughterhouse-five*? *MASH*? 

Hilarious as *Dr Strangelove* is, I think its creative ambitions fall short of those demonstrated by *Catch 22*. *Strangelove* is a brilliantly told joke, the point being to shine light on the ridiculousness of the cold war arms race. It's irreverent, almost immature (in a good way) in its tone; the schoolboy humour offset by the deadpan, drop dead visual cool of the thing. It's a while since I read *Catch 22*, but my memory of it is as an entirely weightier piece. Yes there is irreverent satire - but there's a whole lot more besides. Is there content I'm missing?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Married to Fellini and especially his masterpieces *La Dolce Vita* (1960) and *8 1/2* (1963), I am greatly struck by the similarities between *La Dolce Vita* and Evelyn Waugh's *Vile Bodies* (1930) which I read for the first time recently. I am surprised further by the absence of reference to these similarities when searching the internet. 

Interviews with Fellini himself suggest the only inspiration for *La Dolce Vita* was Fellini's own experiences - that it's an autobiographical film. But the debauched, hedonistic milieu - the grandiose set pieces describing wild parties - the strict episodic structure - the central character of the gossip journalist who's romance with an aristocrat simply blows away into dust - the coldly observational tone that never quite tips over into satire.... Can anyone enlighten me? Is it simply a coincidence? Is this a well established cross-reference I have simply missed? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for posting your article. 

I agree with you that *2001* is not cold and sterile. The scene where Bowman 'shuts down' HAL is arguably the most open hearted Kubrick has ever been. Of course it's quintessential Kubrick that this sentimental scene portrays the death of the villain of the piece. 

I too am a huge admirer of Tarkovsky. But I struggle with *Solaris* - it's the one Tarkovsky film I have seen that made no impact on me at all. Although very generally speaking I would rate Tarkovsky more highly than Kubrick as a film maker, for me personally, out of the two films you mention, *2001* is far and away the more successful. What I struggled with in *Solaris* was the world that Tarkovsky creates. Frankly I just didn't believe it. I completely missed any deeper meanings contained within the narrative, because I just didn't believe the action.

The space craft most of the film is shot on for example - it never seemed more to me than a series of disconnected studio sets. These individual settings bore no relation to each other and, to me, did not appear to be elements of a larger consistent world. 

Where Tarkovsky absolutely *floors* me with the sheer beauty of his film making is in his ability to create enchantment. For me this happens suddenly, and springs from the most ordinary, familiar settings. An ordinary kitchen - a half remembered garden - a hotel lobby. It's in these every day settings that Tarkovsky has the ability to create poetry - a sudden, breathtaking magic. A space ship is already fantastic, and so, for me, the enchantment has no foundation. 

In addition, I believe Tarkovsky was essentially a poet of his medium. As science fiction, *Solaris* does seem to require, on one level at least, an element of traditional narrative film making. Tarkovsky does not excel in this area, and so for me watching *Solaris* can feel like watching a poet trying to write a detective novel. 

These are very personal observations on *Solaris*. I know the film is held in the highest regard by film theorists far more qualified than me, and of course there are likely many aspects of this deeply complexed film I simply missed.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> For my two favourite directors - Maurice Pialat and Agnes Varda - casting non-actors in films was a big part of their creative identity. In France in general there is a tradition of this, sometimes leading to overnight stardom for the actor in question. One example that springs to mind was Beatrice Dalle in *Betty Blue*. One of the most extraordinary examples of this I've ever seen was Stefano Cassetti in the 2001 Cedric Kahn film *Roberto Succo*. Apparently Kahn saw Cassetti in a bar and asked him if he wanted to star in his movie. His performance is amazing! As far as I know it was his only engagement as an actor. Homayoun Ershadi in *Taste Of Cherry* is another great example. I think he was working as an architect before Kiarostami cast him..? Now that I start to think of it there are many examples of this kind of casting. 

I think in these cases the director must simply be working on pure instinct. There is perhaps also some kind of 'beginners naivety' at work. I think of it as similar to making mayonnaise. The first few times you do it it goes beautifully because you don't know what can go wrong. As soon as you realise how easily it can split, it splits. One of the greatest screen actors of our time, Sandrine Bonnaire, arguably gave her best performances in her first few films when she was still a teen. 

As for bad or mediocre actors who are great in a particular role, I can't think of examples of this. I don't think even a great director can transform a bad actor into a great one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do think *Sophie's Choice* is a very good movie. Film critics can be a little sniffy about it, and I gather this might be because it's a very literal adaptation from the book (I haven't read the book so I can't confirm). If you imagine the film without Streep, it's nowhere near as powerful. It's a great performance in a good film. Maybe for this reason it doesn't make it onto top 100 lists and the like (if you pay attention to those!). I adore *Kramer Vs Kramer*, but (just IMO) it's a beautiful chamber piece, and maybe lacks the cinematic ambition to be considered 'great'. I don't think *Adaptation* is a great film. 

If you're looking for more superb and compelling Streep performances there are many to choose from! Maybe a couple of less obvious options - *The French Lieutenant's Woman* and *Plenty* - both these films demonstrate what Meryl can do with some very sophisticated writing (Harold Pinter and David Hare respectively - both theatre writers). I think *Heartburn* introduced her fabulous comic ability to the world. I love her performance in *Lemony Snicket*, again she revealed and aspect of herself I hadn't seen before here. I think she's incredible in *The Devil Wears Prada*, even though that is not the best movie ever made. *Falling In Love* is another fascinating Meryl turn in a seldom raved about movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meryl Streep is an absolutely phenomenal screen actress! The combination of technique, emotional depth, and beauty is unparalleled. She is, perhaps, a little over exposed these days. There is a danger - even for fans like myself - of Streep fatigue. I think too that despite an extraordinary career, she has failed to star in what you might think of as 'great' movies. Deniro had *Raging Bull* and *Taxi Driver* - Nicholson had *One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest* and *The Shining* - but what about Meryl? She has given truly great performances in very good movies (*Sophie's Choice*, *Out Of Africa*, *Silkwood*), and even the occasional great performance in terrible movies (*The Iron Lady*), but the history-making iconic Streep vehicle has eluded her. Maybe it is yet to come? I hope so! </TEXT>

Structurally it's more consistent and cohesive than *Psycho* which, while brilliant, suffers from a very clunky ending. As far as I can recall *Peeping Tom* has a terrific ending.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Welcome To New York**  Abel Ferrara (2014). Very disappointed with this movie that I've been keen to see since its release. Love Ferrara - love Depardieu - how exciting the prospect of a collaboration between these two. What went wrong? I'm not sure. Ferrara has never been afraid of slightly awkward action and dialogue. If a scene is semi improvised he doesn't mind if it *looks* semi improvised - and I mean semi improvised in the bad way, like an acting class improvisation where everyone's thinking 'what do I say now?'. In the past I've found this has contributed to Ferrara's persona as a kind of raw, underground, almost geurilla film maker - an impression he maintains even with his now very well established reputation. I greatly admire this about him. But in this film I found his trademark 'spontaneity' invasive. For me it backfired, leaving the whole thing utterly unconvincing. I felt like I was just watching a *bad movie*. Neither did I enjoy Depardieu in this film. He looked uncomfortable (as did most of the actors) and a little lost. I did not see a character - I never saw anything other than Gerard Depardieu starring in an Abel Ferrara movie. The promise of that partnership remained the most interesting thing about this film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me *Vertigo* is maybe his most personal film. What I mean is that the 'blonde goddess' obsession was never so intense as it is here. The famous scene in the hotel room where Judy transforms into the other woman - the crazy green light - the music - it's a kind of cinematic orgasm, and the summation of something essential to Hitchcock as an artist. But as a whole I find the film overlong and uneven. I can never remember the story of *Vertigo*, even after seeing it a number of times. It feels like three different movies squashed into one. In terms of a brilliant and cohesive narrative film, I regard *Psycho* as Hitchcock's finest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I think HD is overrated. I am not a film maker, but it strikes me that film making is a highly technical activity. Occassionaly the technical challenges lead to some creative breakthrough, where a director and his/her team find a new way to tell the story and it works beautifully. The downside is that the industry can get too obsessed with technology, and the basics of narrative art get pushed into the background. 3D might be an example of this phenomenon. A film can be a staggering technological achievement, adored by industry insiders who can 'see' the technique, and can leave an audience completely cold. I'm sure HD has added a great deal to cinema on one level, but it's not why people go to the movies or watch them at home. I think cinema's constant striving for technological advancement goes back to its roots though. The very first moving pictures were enjoyed simply because of the illusion the technology created. It was a great novelty, and film will always be looking out for the next novelty.  </TEXT>
