<TEXT> I'm sure you're right, and that's probably what I'll end up doing. 

My county makes it pretty easy. They have preprinted adoption petitions that you just have to fill out and a list of what to attach. If it wasn't for the pesky "not wanting a convicted murderer to know where his former domestic violence victim lives" thing, this would be a snap. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They used the term consent, but then again they're not lawyers. 

In California, the bio father signed a form terminating his parental rights. The local person said that didn't transfer because it's a "California form."

edit: I just called again. They said that the form he signed in California terminating his parental rights (which was notarized in the prison) is "moot" because we didn't go through with the adoption in that state. So he... has parental rights again? Something about that doesn't sound right. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [MD] Do we have to get consent from the biological father for an adult, step-parent adoption in cases of domestic violence and rape? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-06 17:17:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to adopt my step-son, who just turned 18. Both he and his mother consents. We had started the process in California, but were still on the waiting list for a year before we moved. At that time, he was a minor.

The biological father has not been in his life since he was one, and has not been in contact with either him or my wife since that time. Currently, he's in prison for 80-something more years for an unrelated crime. 

We didn't want to give him our address at that time, since he had already escaped twice (both times during transit, he didn't get very far. But still...). My step-son's conception was non-consensual during a domestic violence episode, so my wife certainly doesn't want him to know where we are now. We had waited to try again until he was an adult, under the mistaken belief that we wouldn't need consent.

I talked to the adoption office for our county today who said that consent is still required, but there "may" be an exception for consent in the case of abandonment or rape situations, but she wasn't sure. Whatever the case, she said it's our responsibility to find the answer as they can't provide legal advice. 

As a practical matter, I know we can use a PO box or alternate address in the county, but that's still a lot more information than my wife is comfortable sharing with him. She's got her OPSEC down. 

Are there any provisions in Maryland where we won't need the consent of the biological father?


EDIT: I found this in the Maryland adoption... law... stuff... which seems to indicate that they honor the termination of parental rights in other states. Am I reading this correctly?

53B04.    
(a)   In this section, order includes any action that, under the laws of another jurisdiction, has the force and effect of a comparable judicial order under this subtitle.  
(b)   In accordance with the United States Constitution, this State shall accord full faith and credit to:  
(1)   an order of another state as to adoption or guardianship in compliance with the other states laws; and  
(2)   **termination of parental rights in compliance with the other states laws.**  
(c)   As to a jurisdiction other than a state:  
(1)   an order for adoption or guardianship entered in compliance with the jurisdictions laws shall have the same legal effect as an order for adoption or guardianship entered in this State; and  
(2)  **termination of parental rights in compliance with the jurisdictions laws shall have the same legal effect as termination of parental rights in this State.** </TEXT>

I mean, it's not just one thing. I've been playing for a long time, and sometimes you just need something new, you know? We've had some good times. Lots of laughs. But now it's time to move on. 

I guess the thing that did it- the straw that broke the camel's back, is the way you shuffle resource bases. Last night, nine of mine were taken over all at once. Last time, it was eleven. I wouldn't mind if you spaced it out, but I'm tired of having it happen all at once. 

So that's it; I just had to say my piece and move on. Thanks for some good times.  </TEXT>

We're with GEHA, and they consider all diabetes medications and supplies to be brand name drugs, which they only cover at 50%. So I'm glad for the half off, but half off of expensive is still expensive. 

We're also grateful for the doctor, who did give us some samples! We got a few pens, some lancets, some strips and some other stuff to last us until we sort out the insurance issue. He (the doctor) really seems to hate diabetes, so he seemed happy to do it. 

The nurse dropped the insulin into the sharps container, otherwise I was going to :(

And thanks for the tip! I'm talking to the benefits coordinator tomorrow, so hopefully I can get it sorted out. 

Thanks again! </TEXT>

My insurance will send me a one touch (something) meter; you're saying that any strips will work with a reader? I wasn't really sure how that worked. How off would you say the generic strips are, compared to the other ones?

We were going to try to get the pen, have you tried those? The thing with the dial? That might be easier for him, if we can get it. 

And, yeah, you're right about the system as a whole. I really didn't think it would be so complicated, seeing as how people need it to live. Hope we can fix it in our lifetimes, you know? 

Thanks for the advice and the well wishes. I really appreciate it. </TEXT>

This is probably a stupid question, but if I get the free reader (a one touch brand) can I use any strips with it? Or is there a compatibility issue?

Yes, I think glucagon is the gun they're talking about. So that might be a thing to get when we can, but maybe not worry about it for Monday?

Insulin, right. Sorry, I forgot to mention that part. I think the insulin is completely covered, or at least mostly. And you got it righ- we're getting lantus and novolog.

Is there anything else we need to make sure to ask about? I think that's all the supplies, right? </TEXT>

I suppose it would be an employer plan, but we have options. I'm a federal employee, so it's through OPM (https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/plan-information/plans/2016/state/md/summary). 

Fortunately, the open enrollment period is coming up in two weeks. I was thinking about calling each of them next week to find out how they cover diabetic supplies like this. 

I can't recall the very long list that my insurance was talking about. They do cover one meter a year, but there was a cost for everything else including the strips, needles, glucose gun and some other things I can't recall.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be (reasonably) angry at the parents, she would need to know the reason why they didn't pay. You could be angry at the parent if they spent all their money on drugs and neglected to feed their child. If there were medical considerations that made it temporarily difficult to make ends meet? Maybe anger wouldn't be the right emotion there. So she (and we) can't reasonably be angry at the parents without assuming the worst about them.

We have to remember that the school board acknowledged that poor children have been affected by this policy simply because the parent was unable to pay. Not unwilling- they're aware (now) that some parents were unable to pay. It's possible, although I can't say for certain, that this child's parents were one of those unable to pay. 

Remember, too, that the amount this child owed [was from last year](http://triblive.com/news/regional/11176905-74/lunch-students-district). Making efforts to collect from last year is fine, i suppose, but the way the policy was implemented here is flawed at best.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For once I have something relevant to add! 

My name's Chris, and I developed the first formal command-level OPSEC program at the National Training Center. As a part of that, I also developed the first Critical Information List (CIL), which is still being used today. So we can all relax- I can assure the previous poster that no one disclosed any Critical Information here today. 

For anyone wanting to know more about OPSEC, I also founded [The Operations Security Professional's Association](http://www.opsecprofessionals.org), a national non-profit Operations Security organization.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great, thanks! The property manager (who is the point of contact for these things; she *thinks* we have an actual board but there appears to be some uncertainty there) says she's "looking into it." 

This might change things. Apparently, there's two accounts. I wasn't aware of this, so for the past year, I've been paying both fees using the same online portal. And every month for the past year, they've been applying it correctly. They applied it correctly on 8/22, but after two months of not applying any payment to any account. It was just sitting there giving me a positive balance.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [MD] Legal fees for a disputed debt </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-23 00:00:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I received a surprise letter from my HOA's lawyer today. They said we were two months behind in dues, and demanded the full amount plus $50 in legal fees. 

The error was on the property manager's side, and it's been cleared up. They received the money but didn't apply it to our account. So now I'm showing a zero balance. 

I assume I still need to dispute the debt through the lawyer (they included a document explaining that it's an attempt to collect a debt and how to dispute it), because it's obviously not valid. But what happens to the $50 legal fee they included? Will the still be expecting me to pay it, or does that go away when the debt is found to be invalid?  </TEXT>

I'll defer to the smart people here, but it seems like you have a pretty solid defense from the ticket. You laterally weren't there. And if you can prove that your car was with you, the court should fond in your favor. 

Whether or not you should mention your boss is a good question for a real lawyer. </TEXT>

ISIS will not send a mass of fighters up against the Russian military. They'll use the jihad to try to call the 16 million Muslims already in Russia to commit violent acts. It's the exact same call the group made when encouraging lone wolf attacks in the West.

They get the credit, as well as the funding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Edit: sorry, I meant to put "medical" in the title**

Some time ago, I took my son to the doctor. It was a general checkup, but there were some minor concerns we made sure to address with the doctor.

Problem was the doctor wasn't available for the appointment. They suggested I see the PA and assured me he was in the same network.

Now a month the later I get a bill saying GEHA denied the claim. They say the PA wasn't actually on the plan and that the office billed the visit as a medical... uh... thing... a problem type of visit, rather than a routine checkup. 

The bill is for the deductable, but even that amount was unexpected since it would have otherwise been covered completely. Am I SOL?  </TEXT>

I found some videos online, and it seems like I should be able to plug straight into the computer via USB and control the software (per the manual, we're trying Ableton Live 9 Lite). But in the manual [online](http://kb.inmusicbrands.com/media/files/Keystation%2061%20-%20User%20Guide%20-%20v1_1.pdf), it looks like I might need a sound module to do... something.

<TEXT> (just my layman, intro to religion class understanding here)

There's actually a lot going on there. 

First is a translation issue. The greek word that we interpret as 'fulfill' is pleroo, which can mean both 'to complete or accomplish' OR 'to make full' or 'fill up.' So he was either saying that he came to complete the law or to make them more full. I suppose I can only draw inferences as to the context. I am not a ~~rapper~~ scholar.

The second piece is what was meant by "the law." In Matthew 5, Jesus (a Jewish man) was speaking to a Jewish audience. As such, he wouldn't clarify what he meant by the law. They would all know that he was referring to the law of moses. That is, the commandments that moses brought down from the mountain. Not ten, there were a bunch of those things. So he was saying that nothing of *that* law would disappear until the end of time. 

Remember that a lot of the most disputed rules in the old testament came from Leviticus, which means literally "for the Levites." It was a book written for the priests of levi to tell them what is expected of them. Jesus would not be telling that particular audience that he is completing / making more full the rules for the priests of levi, particularly as he was not a priest of levi.

It's actually a very fair point, and I completely agree. He has been pursuing things through his school and local resources, but just not a redditor (or so he claims). In that sense, taking into account some of my reddit activities, he might be the mature one, lol.

I remember being a kid and barely noticing that our coffee table had disappeared. I didn't care, though, because we were going to McDonald's! 

We hardly ever went there, so it was such a treat. My sister and I ate as much as we wanted and played for hours on the play place. My mom, of course, at nothing.

I didn't realize until much later that she had sold the coffee table to take us to McDonald's. All so we could eat and have fun.

I love my mom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! It would be perfect for something like this. 

There's the guaranteed discretion element, where your chosen writer has already signed an NDA agreeing not to disclose their connection with your site. That's important to some folks- I know it is to me. 

But regarding your question, DiscreetWriters works on a bidding system. That means that the writers would submit bids within the range you've set (if you chose to specify one), and you can choose the one that best fits your budget. 

Honestly, it's possible to get content written on the cheap. But of course you get what you pay for. Myself, I fell into that trap and once thought I was getting a great deal when I paid $5 for 500 words. They had all the right keywords stuffed in there, but not much else, lol!

<TEXT> First, congratulations on your successes. I'm working on my second personal novel, with another pair ghostwritten for others. I guess I enjoy the former more than the latter!

Thanks for the feedback, and you're right on all counts. 

I think the logo is pretty weak. It doesn't feel very professional.

I'll need to see what I can do to improve the logo, as well as other cosmetic and layout changes. 

Why are "all categories" and "all posted projects" separate?

I don't recall why I had those separated... hmmm, I should probably know that. I'll add that to my todo list. 

Your Facebook link in the footer is broken.

Thanks for the catch on facebook. It was active, but I think they suspended my account for inactivity. 

How do reviews work on your site? Pretty standard to other freelance gig sites?

Yes- reviews work like any other site, or at least the ones you and I probably use. I'm thinking about making reviews mandatory and double-blind once I can find and pay a good coder to do that. 

And a question that I always get asked by my clients, how is the client's privacy valued/assured? 

That's exactly what this site is trying to answer. Each writer has a signed NDA (as you may have seen; thanks for the signup, by the way!), which is essentially their promise to not reveal the names or nature of their clients. Unfortunately, that's only as enforceable as any other NDA. We make it free (whereas other sites make the client pay extra for one), so at least the client can be assured that there's one on file. 

But the real reason that the client can feel that their privacy is ensured is that they can remain completely anonymous to the writers. They don't need to provide a real name and the writer can't even see their email address. Assuming all communication is made via the site, the writer shouldn't be able to reveal the client's information even if they wanted to. Of course that does assume some amount of discretion in the information provided by the client. 

It's something that I believe strongly in. I want to help writers find another avenue for work, and I want to help people get the work done that they need. I really hope I don't let you down :) </TEXT>

They would answer, which is piped over to the new project page. So someone might say, "write me a vogon poem" and BAM! They're on the project page and only a few clicks away from being done. 

But that's the way it looked in my head. Sounds like I may have missed the mark. 

Thanks for the advice and feedback. I'll play around with the layout and appearance and see if I can improve it based on your suggestions! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ha! I got the same thing. They said that they saw my post in /r/smallbusiness and they thought I might "benefit from their services." 

They're referring to the post in smallbusiness, where I was talking about the upcoming launch of my own freelance-type website. 

I replied, "Just so I understand, are you inviting me to become a customer of a site that completes with the one I'm building?" But I didn't get a reply and the account was banned. Too bad, I would have liked to see what they had to say.

<TEXT> People are afraid of the unknown, and clowns are unknown. They're wearing makeup, so some see them not as human but as gross caricatures of what a human might look like. 

The horror genre, doing what it is meant to do, took that natural discomfort and turned it into a trope. It's just like how our natural fear of the dark turned into countless scary movies or how our fear of death turned into zombie movies. Yes, I know I'm oversimplifying things, but it's pretty close. 

That's why the clowns in horror (and people's fears) are normally [whiteface](http://www.allaboutclowns.com/images/bozo.jpg) clowns. They're harder to read, if that's what you're looking for. Examples include Pennywise, Gacy and others. But the [Auguste](http://www.allaboutclowns.com/images/knute_auguste.jpg), [Hobo](http://paragondesignonline.com/images/shinbone_the_clown-2.jpg) and other character clowns (like rodeo clowns) are generally accepted. Or at least not feared. 

I was raised with a connection to the circus. I don't tell many people (except for countless strangers, apparently), but my grandfather was a professional circus clown. He traveled the country with different circuses. He loved entertaining the children the most- they all did. I was taught (and shown) that clowns are supposed to be loving, and loving people are those that are best fit for the nose. 

He told me once about a friend of his. He was a stiltwalker clown- one of the ones that walk around on stilts. They were doing a clown show for the children there, and everyone was having a wonderful time. The thing with stiltwalking is that there are certain risks involved, but theres safety measures in place to protect the clown and the audience. 

If you ever see a clown on stilts, youll see (or should see) another person (normally a clown) nearby at all times. That person has one job: to keep people away from the legs. Remember that scene in Star Wars when they bring down the Imperial Walker? Thats generally undesirable for the clown. But if that fails, the clown has practiced falling time and time again. They know how to fall without serious injury, so its as safe as could be. 

After a long day in the sun, people get tired. One little boy slipped past the handler. He just wanted to give the tall clown a big hug, and he wrapped his arms around the stilts. Or, as far as he knew, the legs. No one could react in time- the stiltwalker was coming down. But, of course, they know how to fall. They know how to save themselves in such a situation. 

Unfortunately, in this case, the proper way to fall would bring the clown down on a group of small children. The weight of an adult falling from such a height on tiny, fragile bodies would hurt them at best. Kill one or more, at worst. According to those watching, the falling clown didnt even hesitate. He fell the *wrong* way, landing on his head and neck. The other clowns did what they could to play it off as a silly accident, but they all knew. 

He was conscious long enough to pretend that he was okay. The happy little boy never knew that clown died later that night. All because he made a split-second decision to put himself at risk instead of the children that loved him. According to my grandfather, they all would have done the same thing. Because a clown is love, and love would never hurt a child. 

My grandfather is too old to perform now. He hasnt in years. He takes care of my grandmother, whose health is failing. But Ill always remember how he came alive when he put on his costume. He was a different man then. He wasnt Jack or Grandpa. He was Patrick the Clown. He would show me the cage that had the Worlds Silliest Monkey (a mirror behind a screen) and balance a huge stack of plates (only to drop them! But its okay, they were all connected by string). He will never perform again. 

I have his costume now. A real clown costume, with a beaver skin wig and original Vans shoes (yes, they used to make clown shoes). It needs cleaning and maybe a little bit of tailoring, but its been worn by three generations of my family. 

For me, I dont plan to join the circus. I have a job and a family- I dont have the time. But theres a childrens wing of my local hospital. If a clown is love, they could use a clown. Did you know that hospitals have [clowns that come in to entertain ill (sometimes terminal) children?]( https://erlhelathcomm.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/pr_clown-visit-017-b.jpg). There are hospital clown care programs in every state in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Canada, Israel and all over Europe. According to Wikipedia:

 Clown Doctors use techniques such as magic, music, storytelling and other clowning skills to empower children with doses of fun that help them deal with the range of emotions they may experience while in hospital: fear, anxiety, loneliness, boredom.

The healing power of humor and laughter combats stress, reduces pain by releasing endorphins (the body's natural painkiller), boosts the immune system by increasing the level of T cells   lowering serum cortisol levels, helps promote a positive outlook, helps people to cope with difficult situations and helps to create bonds and therefore support between people, all of which aids the healing process.

So, yeah, Id like to be a part of that.

Clowns arent scary. They dont hurt people. Ive never met a clown (and Ive met so many!) that didnt legitimately care about every child or adult that they met. They only want to make you laugh and forget about your troubles for a little while. So if you meet a clown and he or she squirts you in the face with a bottle of seltzer, thats their way of saying, I love you. 

Not to plug, but my grandfather wrote a fictionalized historical novel about his experiences. Heres [an excerpt]( http://assets.booklocker.com/pdfs/1664s.pdf) that talks about his decision to become a clown. 

Edit: another story. I used to read my grandfather's clown trade magazines (yes! There is such a thing. Apparently the decision to go color caused quite a bit of controversy in the community). I remember a story about a hospital clown. I never met this clown, so I can't vouch for his story. But it aligns to what I know about those that pursue the calling.

This was a hardcore hospital clown; he used to visit the cancer ward. I couldn't imagine how emotionally taxing that would be, seeing so many children so ill. But he did it every week, and they all knew they could count on him to be there for him. 

Those children don't have many choices in their life. They didn't choose to be ill, and they can't choose what happens to them on a daily basis. They can't decide not to have another shot or another round of chemo. They can't say know when the doctor wants to come in or the nurse needs to wake them up for medicine. But he gave them a choice- sometimes the only choice they had. They could choose if he came into the room or not. They could choose what to talk about (not just their illness or symptoms, unless they wanted to). They could choose what balloon animal he made or even how long they spent together. They deserved to have choices, so at least he could give them that. 

One day, a child made the choice that he didn't want to see this clown. That's okay, he smiled and waved and gave a small toy to the mother for the child. And he went on to other rooms and other children. Some time later, the mother found him in the hallway and said that her son had changed his mind, and could he please see him if he had the time. He probably wasn't ever going to leave the hospital, and his prognosis was very grim. He was, to be blunt, there to die. Could he please, she asked, spend just a few minutes with him before he left?

A clown always has the time. 

He went in to see the little boy. He looked so small in the big bed. He had tubes in his arms and sensors on his chest. He was clearly very ill. But he smiled so wide when the clown came in! And for the first time in a while, he laughed while the clown danced and joked. It was a good day. A welcome distraction from his illness. 

He asked if he could hug the clown, but the equipment and the bed made that difficult. So the mother found a nurse who helped them arrange the tubes and wires, so the little boy could sit on his new friend's lap. He sat there for a long time, and the clown let him stay for as long as he wanted. He knew that the little boy was very, very ill, and this may be one of the last memories that he had. When he fell asleep, the clown let him stay. He needed the rest.

That's where he died. On the clown's lap. He was very sick. 

The clown knew that the child was dead. The mother knew it, too. But the other children that could see them didn't know. There was an unspoken agreement between the mother and the clown. If the doctors and nurses knew what had happened, they didn't interfere. It was a very serious thing in that ward when a child died, and the last thing anyone wanted to do was to traumatize the other children that were fighting for their own lives. So he held the child for just a little bit longer, put him back on the bed, and allowed the medical staff to do what they needed to do. 

He didn't cry until he was outside, away from the children. Later, he heard from the grieving mother. She took some small comfort in knowing that her child didn't die in a hospital bed, but in the arms of someone that loved him.

<TEXT> I'm aware of that, and the tutorial is very helpful. If memory serves (and it may not) it was talking about how minor color corrections and changing a small amount (or single?) Pixels *may not* show up on the ela analysis. But such a massive change as suggested in this thread? I would expect to see that show up on the ela analysis. There's also cases where saving the image multiple times can reduce variation, but in the analysis you're seeing the variation that you would expect to find in a legitimate image. 

But maybe that's just me. Feel free to try it, if you want. It wouldn't be hard to Photoshop that same image and run it through the Fotoforensics tool. I'd be interested in seeing what you come up with.

So in one hand we have an ela that's consistent with a real image and we have the original poster (if you do a reverse image search) with the background story and other (unrelated) images from that day. On the other hand, we have people saying that it "looks" shopped to them. Of I were a betting man, I know which one of put my money on. 

Anyway, you're right that ela analysis isn't a smoking gun, but it's a pretty good indication in most cases.

<TITLE> Setting up a 'hacker bootcamp' for my office's Bring Your Child to Work Day. Not sure where to start. (x-post /r/asknetsec) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-12 16:34:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **edit: an awesome and knowledgeable redditor, /u/Stackoverload, is helping walk me through this.**

**edit2: Unfortunately, /u/Stackoverload, had other commitments that called him away from this. If anyone else can help out, I'd appreciate it.**

My office is doing a take your child to work day, and we're doing a 'hacker boot camp' to talk about the importance of vulnerability assessments and common web security issues. Problem is, it's a short suspense and I'm really not sure how to put it all together. 

I have multiple computers available with internet access. I have a web server (remote) I can dump files to. I was thinking about giving the kids a brief orientation about common issues, along with notes and tips as a handout. Things from the very basic levels of HackThisSite- checking the source code for comments, basic injection, things like that. It would be a simple game of capture the flag- first team through three 'levels' wins the competition. 

Now, here's my secret shame. I'm not that great at web programming. I know html and some css, but I don't really have the ability to do anything very complex. Is there a resource where I can get some ready-built code to host on my server? Or anything that I can put together that would be challenging, but not too challenging?

Thanks for any advice/help!

<TEXT> Not really a small business, but a non-profit group. But I think the answer would be the same. 

I need to get some volunteers working towards a specific goal. I'm only looking at those that said they'd be interested in doing that sort of thing when they signed up. 

In your experience, what day of the week is the best day to get people engaged? I was going to do it Monday, but I know I don't feel very eager to start new projects on a Monday. And on Friday, I think people are pretty eager to finish up their work and get ready for the weekend. Starting new things might not be on their radar on that day. 

What days work for you, when you're trying to engage people?  </TEXT>

That would fall under the realm of "fraud, waste and abuse," which is the term for misuse or misappropriation of government resources. 

You ARE afforded certain protections when reporting suspected fraud, waste and abuse, but only when using the process for doing so (at least as far as that act is concerned). Talking about it to your friends or coworkers and accusing someone of it based on perception is not protected. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a different interpretation, but that's a problem in and of itself. As you say, correctly, the bill is very ambiguous. But it's the parts that are NOT ambiguous that concern me.

Under the text of the law, a religious shelter could decide to refuse services to a person if it violates their beliefs. That part itself directly spelled out. Perhaps the intent is to protect churches who don't want to marry gay people, but that's not what the text states. It leaves a great deal of latitude for a religious organization that doesn't wish to provide food bank services to someone when it doesn't support their religious objectives. Or, as we already discussed, taking in someone that is gay or transgender. 

But we're both drawing on what 'could' happen depending on the interpretation and text of the bill, and that's one way that it's fundamentally flawed. Perhaps, then, the governor was correct in vetoing it for at least that reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How am I not making a point in citing the act? Didn't a provide a specific provision where a faith-based organization (such as a shelter, for example) may legally refuse service to someone based on their sexual orientation? 

I stand corrected on 10-1-1001. But I can't seem to find what that code actually is- the copy of the Georgia code that I was able to find online stops at around 10-1-900 or so. What, I wonder, does the proposed bill allow reference to 10-1-1001? (edit: I see- that was a proposed section that would be added to the Georgia code, which would protect organizations and employees from discrimination suits based on the internal text. Got it, and withdrawn)

We can disagree about whether or not such discrimination has occurred. That's fine and not really relevant to this discussion. But do you agree that a refusal of services as described in the article would be legal under the proposed bill?

<TEXT> I completely agree! I think that's a gross perversion of the intent of the IRS code. Arguably, it violates the rule against private inurement, which means that a single person (or group of people) shouldn't benefit 'unfairly' from the charity's activities. Problem is that can be really hard to define. But morally it's wrong (IMO) for a pastor to live in a multi-million dollar home while others starve or live in the streets. 

If they're going to be taxes, they should have to prove their contributions to the needy and the poor for their deductions.

YES! I agree. I don't know how it could be done legally, but I wish there was some sort of test as to the societal 'value' of a church.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "(b) No faith based organization shall be required to provide social, educational, or charitable services that violate such faith based organization's sincerely held religious belief as demonstrated by its practice, expression, or clearly articulated tenet of faith"

That would have protected the actions of [THIS homeless shelter](http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/01/18/139396/georgia-homeless-gay-people/) which refused to serve gay people based upon their religious beliefs. Speaking of which, you said:

Find me a homeless shelter that has refused services to gay people and I'll send you to Cancun

Was that a sincere offer? I wouldn't mind a vacation. 

Edit: The proposed bill also reads:

A refusal by a faith based organization pursuant to Code Section 10-1-1001 shall not give rise to a civil claim or cause of action against such faith based organization or an employee thereof or result in any state action to penalize, withhold benefits from, or discriminate against the faith based organization or employee based on such refusal.

Where Code Section 10-1-1001 is the fair business practices act.

<TEXT> Just a small aside. 

The only thing churches should be forced to do is pay taxes

There's a few good reasons why this may not be the case. The agreement between churches and the government is that they'll basically stay out of each other's way. Of course churches have to follow the law, but it's perceived / desirable that they provide a community service that offsets government expenses. This specifically speaks to the churches (I'm including all religious faiths there) that provide a direct community benefit by having food banks, shelters, and other services consistent with their beliefs. 

Not all churches do this, of course. In my opinion, they *should*, but I don't think the government wants to decide what services constitute a community benefit. I would like to see an acid test of direct benefit to the community regardless of religious affiliation, but that's, like, my opinion, man.

The other more pressing issue is the 'rights' that paying taxes allows a corporation. Remember that a church is legally a corporation- just a special one under the same umbrella as a other charities. Without the special agreement afforded to charities, a church would get a direct voice in the government just like any company would. They could legally influence legislation and endorse a candidate. They could donate money to a particular candidate and support their causes. Right now, they can't legally do that (and yes, it happens. If you see it, you can report it to the IRS and they risk losing their 501c3 status). 

So there's definitely an argument to be made for taxing churches. But if we do so, we have to accept that the government will loosen the restrictions on what they can and can't legally do.

<TEXT> Scientology, like many of the more 'outlandish' cults, have a big hurdle to overcome with new members: they have to seem legitimate and sane enough to keep them coming back until they're sufficiently conditioned to accept the more extreme concepts. I mean, if they invited you in and started talking about space aliens and clams on day one, you probably wouldn't come back. 

So Hubbard combined three things: common sense statements that sound deep until you remember that you once read them on a cereal box, things he stole from other people and his own special blend of moonbattery. 

For example, the UN created the [universal declaration of human rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html), and defined 30 fundamental rights that we all share. Scientology claims to support those rights and uses that 'secular' message to get into schools. But with a twist. #27 talks about the right "to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits" and "to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author." Scientology just says that "copyright" is a fundamental human right. Probably self-serving, seeing as their secret church material is copyrighted. 

Or their 'study tech', which is a very flawed implementation of actually successful concepts. They borrow heavily from Montessori education, for example, but misapply it tot he point of uselessness. But they use that to establish and infiltrate schools. 

They often start off with a test called the "[Oxford Capacity Analysis](http://www.xenu.net/archive/oca/)" (which has nothing to do with Oxford), which can often seem legitimate, even through it's skewed to make the test-taker feel like they've done very poorly on the test and in life. But fear not! They have some courses that can help fix those specific problems. 

The basic courses are all pseudo-scientific, but add an element of "wow, you're really special and can do powerful things with your mind if you give us money. And did you know we're trying to save the world?" Once they find someone's 'ruin', they'll exploit that to get them in deeper and deeper. 

You can read a bit in Hubbard's on words [here](http://www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/5.htm), but [this](http://www.xenu.net/) is probably one of the best pages on the topic. This [page](http://www.ezlink.com/~perry/CoS/Theology/index.htm) gets pretty deep into comparing the theology with other systems. It's important that scientology claims to be compatible with all other religions, especially when you really look at the contradictions between them.  </TEXT>

I've been reading through a lot of the older threads, and a lot of people mention that (realistic) possibility, but I haven't found anyone that's posted after the fact with their experience.

<TEXT> We'd have to be pretty liberal with the definition of "reasonably" to consider that battle reasonably accurate. Don't get me wrong, I love the book, but Brooks clearly wrote that scene as a satiric criticism of the US government, much like he satirized mainstream media elsewhere in the book. 

The military can have problems fighting the *next* war, but gets pretty good at certain fighting styles when they've been training for it. For example, William Westmoreland was the WWII war hero that was put in charge of Vietnam. He treated Vietnam like WWII, and thought that it could be fought like a conventional war. In other words, he tried to fight a war of attrition against guerilla forces that didn't have the common decency to join us in a fair fight so we could blow them up. 

In the book, Brooks says that's the type of war that they tried to fight at Yonkers and that's why it was a failure. The problem is that the military had been fighting in a COIN (Counter Insurgency) environment for the ten years leading up to Yonkers. That's specifically addressed in the book, when Brooks mentions the years of 'brushfire' wars that had sapped the administration's political capital. 

So assuming the military followed its own regulations, training, planning processes and experience, it would have planned the battle very differently. Evaluating the adversary is built right into the planning process, and there was certainly plenty of time to do so. So they would have known that they don't need anti-air defenses, but they DID need overwatch and antipersonnel weapons. I'd go so far as to say that the humans would have the advantage. If you're planning the 'when' and 'how' of a battle, you have the luxury of prestaging every weapons platform and ammunition for it. 

I'm not saying the way things were presented is impossible. It COULD happen that way, but it would take major failures and oversights at every single level for it to have gone the way it was written. So I think we're left to take it as Brooks seems to have intended it: not necessarily accurate, but entertaining and thought-provoking. 

But it doesn't really matter. It was an awesome scene anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You probably would, and that's a good thing. 

Let's say you punch a coworker in a back room somewhere. No witnesses, but they report it. You actually did it, but your company doesn't know for sure right away. 

They have three options: fire you, stop paying you until they investigate, or remove you from the environment until they can determine what's going to happen to you.

1 and 2 seem unreasonable. What if you were being falsely accused? You shouldn't be fired, and it wouldn't be fair that you weren't paid while they determined you were innocent. So you're moved somewhere else or told to go home while they decide your fate. You're not being punished before your guilt is determined and you can't try to influence the investigation by threatening witnesses or calling in favors. Even the guilty... ESPECIALLY the guilty... deserve a fair process.

Putting police on administrative leave should, ideally, give them a fair review while limiting their ability to influence the investigation. I'm not saying it's a perfect process that should be applied to all situations. I'm only saying that it's not designed to be an award. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not agreeing with it, but just providing a counterpoint.

The justification may be that many (most?) officers undergo additional training that other drivers do not. Much like why soldiers are unrestrained in the back of a five-ton truck driven by a (sometimes) trained operator.

That doesn't control other drivers, of course, but I would assume that police deaths due to traffic accidents in a **non-emergency** situation would be lower than the statistical average among all drivers.

<TEXT> You're referring to the first-sale doctrine, which allows someone to distribute (normally physical) copyrighted works after the transfer of ownership. CDs and books are specifically addressed in this law. 

Digital copies and transmissions aren't quite as clear, because there's no actual transfer of the work. The recipient receives a copy, but the rights to it don't transfer the same way as it does with a physical object. More specifically, the first sale doctrine does not apply if possession is obtained without actually acquiring ownership. 

So, it's complicated and the law needs to be updated to reflect new technologies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The complex political and social environments between two nations are not compatible, you're right about that. 

But that's not what I claimed.

I said that it is not difficult to build and detonate explosives. The fact that they are rarely used in the united States is not relevant, because ability and execution are very different things. 

Perhaps we have different opinions on how easy it is to build an explosive device. Difficulty is a relative concept. But recall that the explosives used is Paris were described as "[easy to build](http://www.techinsider.io/paris-attack-tatp-chemical-bombs-2015-11)". 

Perhaps, also, we're thinking about different types of explosives. Daisy-chained shape charges with victim-detonated triggers are fairly complex. PVC pipe filled with black powder and pellets are not complex nor difficult to build. Neither are pressure cooker bombs. Neither are truck-carried fertilizer bombs. But each have been successfully used in the US and worldwide. 

I'm not disputing your claim that bombings are uncommon. All I'm saying is that we can't honestly characterize homemade bombs as difficult to build or deploy. More complicated than pulling a trigger, certainly, but still an option (and tactic) successfully used by violence aficionados all over the world.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, I see where the confusion is. I said:

So you're right that rural and wealthy areas should have lower crime and murder rates. And they do, assuming that the entire nation isn't exactly the same. Our rates are significantly skewed by inner city and gang violence. 

My intention was to address homicide rates. I can see how that was unclear outside of the context of this thread. So I agree that general crime rates can be worse in rural areas, but I'll clarify my point to reduce the understandable confusion: homicide rates are higher in cities than in rural areas. 

Thanks for prompting me to better communicate my point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally speaking, that's true. I technically live in Baltimore and have never had any problems at all. But when you get into the "blue light" areas, you tend to find more crime. It's not because the people there are all bad, but because there are many factors that contribute to increased crime rates in those areas. 

Related to the topic at hand, your link does conclude that "the risk of homicide is greater in big cities than it is in the countryside" and the safety difference is largely due to automobile accidents. Per capita, you're still more likely to be a victim of violent crime in a city. More so in the inner cities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For your metaphor to be accurate, we can't pretend there's only one tower. If that was the case, then we could just close it down and consider the problem solved! Instead, we have to imagine that there are already many, many towers and we have already lost the ability to close them all down. That's a more analogous to the gun control debate, because the guns are already in our inner cities. 

So let's pretend that people keep falling off tall trees. There are millions of tall trees in the country, and we can't reasonably expect to be able to close them all down. Just like the gun control debate, where we can't reasonably expect to make all the guns go away. Unless you can think of a way- better minds than me have been trying to think of one for a long time. You say it's easy to limit access to guns... how would you suggest we go about doing that? 

So, if people kept falling out of these trees and I knew I couldn't reasonably or quickly stop them from climbing them, I would look at other factors that I could control which would be likely to have a demonstrable impact. If I found that people from certain areas were more likely to die this way than others, wouldn't I focus on the issues that are causing them to climb up, rather than worrying about what the guy in the mojave desert is doing?

This metaphor got a little weird, but I think you see the point. 

You're right that the simplest solution should go first. And identifying why certain areas are more prone to gun violence may be the key to figuring out what that is. I'm pretty sure that MORE gun laws (or, as you seem to be suggesting, confiscations) will not be the easiest of the potential solutions. 

Good thought process though, overall.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It certainly is. My point is that it's not the *only* factor, like some people try to suggest. 

Out of all the factors, I think that availability of guns is one of the *most* difficult to influence. The guns are already in the inner cities, and we have a criminal element related to the cartels that brings more in to the southern states. More laws won't significantly change those facts- not when those that are more likely to use guns for criminal acts are, in fact, criminals. 

But there are many factors that are directly related to violence rates- ones that can be statistically attributed, which is at least suggestive. We can start addressing socioeconomic factors, for example, which would reduce homicide rates a lot faster than this endless national debate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a tricky one. 

When someone is on psychiatric medication, there is *already* a mental health concern. Did the medication cause the criminal act? Did it contribute? Would they have done it without he medication? Did the medication lessen the chances of doing such a thing? 

It would be difficult to blame the drug when their mental state is already an issue. It's like the dog that barks at his food because it burns his tongue, who tries it later to find that it's cooler. Of course, the dog reasons, barking at food cools it. Or, to out it another way, I don't think such a link could be positively established. 

Unless one is a scientologist. In which case, it was definitely the pychs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except you're looking at the nation as though it's the same everywhere, which ignores some of the contributing factors. 

Violent crime rates in the US are much higher, per capita, than the rural and stronger economic areas. Let's use the national average as our baseline: 4.5 annual murders per 100,000 people (2013 numbers). Baltimore, as an example, had a rate last year ten times higher than that. 

Compare that number to Napa, California which is wealthy and relatively rural- the type of place that you describe. It had one murder in 2011. I can't find more recent data, but I think that illustrates the point.

So you're right that rural and wealthy areas should have lower crime and murder rates. And they do, assuming that the entire nation isn't exactly the same. Our rates are significantly  skewed by inner city and gang violence. 

In fact, according to the FBI,  gang's uses of guns have increased steadily since the 1980s and homicides in general during the commission of a crime (in other words, by those ready committing a crime and who will be unlikely to follow gun laws) have increased by 50% between 1985 and 2005. 

So there certainly is a problem and the gun-related deaths in the US is higher than other nations. That's a fact. However we can't afford to look at the problem in a vacuum, which some people are doing for political purposes. We have to look at WHERE these crimes are happening and consider what factors are contributing to these statistics.

I don't think the plumber intentionally tried to block the claim. Or, at least, I don't see why he would. My choice of words was bad, I think. It sounds to me like the warranty company just grabbed onto anything that they could to deny the claim, even if it wasn't related to the actual fault.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, thanks for the reply!

Normally, I would agree with you. However, the plastic bits (if there were any) would have only gotten in the valve- the very same part that failed in the first place and will need to be replaced. So it wouldn't actually change the repair process at all, since I have that entire piece sitting by the tub waiting to be installed! 

I guess it feels a little bit like having your gas tank crack and going in to have it replaced, but having them refuse to do it because dirt got in the tank. If the tank's being replaced anyway, the dirt isn't going to make that any more difficult. 

Now that I think about it, that's a pretty crappy metaphor. But you get what I'm saying, lol

At my old home, we made pretty good use of the warranty. This place is just... just awful.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Maryland] [Update] Home warranty company denied claim for a second time, even though part is covered. The plumber told them that the damage was due to 'abuse'. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-22 16:33:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> e: my title sucks. The plumber didn't use the word 'abuse.' He said that I stripped a part unrelated to the covered part. The warranty company denied the claim based on that citing 'abuse.' 

First post was [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3yjc31/maryland_more_problems_with_the_house_this_time/)

The home warranty company now acknowledges that the damaged part is covered- it's the valve, which they acknowledge. They talked to the service provider (the plumber that they sent out, who first incorrectly told them it was the faucet) who told them that a plastic nut was stripped by me. That part is true- it's the plastic ring that comes on and off and tightens down the faucet. Every time you take it off or tighten it, it wears down a little bit. So the manufacturer sent a new one so I wouldn't have to worry about it. All's good so far. The valve was leaking before I tried to tighten that, and it was leaking before the plumber checked it and messed with it, too. That is not the cause of the leaking, and even the plumber acknowledges that is not the cause. 

When the warranty company called the plumber, they told them about that piece. The company used that to deny the claim entirely, saying that we invalidated the warranty by stripping the piece (in the presence of the plumber). It's not stripped, but the plumber defended ~~his~~ their position (edit: I have no idea why) by saying that any bits of plastic that came off "might" have gotten in the valve and make it harder to fix. That's ridiculous, since the manufacturer sent out a whole new valve assembly, so it would all be replaced at once anyway. 

The terms of the warranty are [here](http://www.longandfosterwarranty.com/id.lasso?tid=263).

I understand that they can use technicalities to their advantage- I get that I might be screwed on that piece. But something about this doesn't smell right. Have they done anything wrong, from a legal perspective? Can I go through small claims court to compel them to fix the covered part?

Edit: The part of the warranty that they cited reads: " the Agreement does not cover failures which may result from other causes, such as without limitation: abuse". The failure was not the result of any abuse, and it was a problem before the plumber even came out. How could that piece even be an issue if the entire piece is going to be replaced by the part the manufacturer sent out? There was no abuse and the fault was not caused by taking off that part.

<TEXT> Nope. in 1856, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers had no duty to protect any individual- that they were chartered to uphold the laws in general, but that they have no specific duty to protect or serve any person. This was revisited in in 1982 when the Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit held, "...there is no Constitutional right to be protected by the state against being murdered by criminals or madmen."

UC Berkley studied considered this question in 1984, when they noted, "The Williams court assumed that there is no general duty to aid another, that police officers owe only a duty to the public at large, and that the police hence have no legal duty to aid a citizen in distress. As a result, the court applied the Good Samaritan doctrine to the officers' actions." The authors disagreed with the court's opinion on that case, but noted that police officers (specifically, in that case, california highway patrol officers) have no duty to assist in traffic accidents or other emergency situations.

In other words, police officers are chartered to serve the state and uphold laws in general. They don't have a specific obligation to protect and serve anyone. Our taxes pay them to uphold the laws established by the state. If you want specific protection, sometimes that costs extra. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a decent point, actually. I used to work with children, and I've seen both types. The problem is that sometimes it can be difficult to tell one from the other, since it can be hard to gauge intent. But sometimes, there are those exactly like you describe: those that *choose* not to put in the effort to care for their children. Often times (but not all the time), child protective services can get involved which may result in the children being removed from the home.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been ten years since I was overseas, so maybe things have changed since then, but the overriding guidance was that you are to take whatever measures you feel are necessary to protect your life and those of your battle buddies. 

We were trained that the ROE is intended to avoid conflict whenever possible, deescalate situations that can be deescalated and avoid innocent deaths whenever possible. If I remember right, the process is:

**Shout** a warning or verbal direction. For example, if someone's walking towards to your convoy, tell them to back up before they get close. 

**Show** that you're armed and willing to fire if necessary

**Shove**. If possible, use non-lethal force

**Shoot** if you have to. And we're trained to shoot to stop the threat- it's not shoot to kill. But two in the center mass often ends up doing that anyway

I remember being stopped near the Tigris once. I was in the turret of a guntruck manning a mounted .50cal. Suddenly these kids pop up out of nowhere and start running towards the trucks. They were fast, and there were a lot of them carrying bags. I don't know if it was true or not, but we were warned about insurgents using kids as walking bombs. That was a good use of the ROE. They were trying to sell us water (freshly bottled from the river). 

So the ROE could be seen as putting lives in danger, and it could be seen as trying to reduce deaths among noncombatants. All that I know is that I fired if fired on, and I would try to act legally and morally while protecting my life and those that depended on me to watch their back. If that meant firing first, I would fire first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fully support training police officers to better recognize and handle people with mental illnesses, but I think that it's often to late by the time they have that encounter. Our mental health system as a whole needs to be better funded and intervention needs to be the priority. 

According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, up to 25% of homeless people have some form of 'severe' mental illness. For homeless families, mental illness is a factor in 12% of cases. If we can start talking that problem, we can improve the quality of life for an incredible number of people and families. Those that couldn't function effectively in society may be able to not only function within it, but materially contribute to it as well. And, as a result, there will be fewer police interactions when proper treatment has been started. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was on vacation, and making passionate, sweaty love to my wife. This was new for us, as our lovemaking tended to be brief and purely functional. But I attributed the refreshing change to the romantic locale and thrill of going on our first vacation in years.

Mid thrust, I noticed something odd about her skin. A flake- not unusual in and of itself, but out of place given her usual, nearly obsessively maintained appearance. 

I flicked at it, but it didn't move. I pulled, and it finally came free. Her skin, however, looked even more unusual after that. Loose somehow. Uneven. I pulled again. She didn't seem to notice, but her skin was now coming off in large, fleshy chunks. And that's when I noticed the hair, which seemed to be growing under her otherwise delicate facial features. My heart froze. I knew then who was under the mask.

<TEXT> From my not-a-lawyer understanding, laws are in place that could be applied to this case, yes. However, extraterritorial laws and issues involving military dependents can be very complex. The experts- the ones that deal with this sort of thing all the time- would be found in the post's JAG office. Also, if you haven't talked to them already, your parents might be able to help you understand what has happened and what could happen. 

Your friend has to understand that this might not just go away if she ignores it. Yes, the person that filmed it doesn't seem to care and likely would do it to someone else given the opportunity. But who knows how many people received it? Did any of them save it? Have they posted it anywhere else? Did the original filmer keep a copy, and does he plan on doing anything else with it? Those are things that she might want to consider.

<TEXT> Maybe it will be used here, and maybe not. We can't really speculate. But the point is that the act would apply here and the US could ~~decide to~~ prosecute if they decide to do so. That, and it answers the original question that it IS illegal based on the specific circumstances surrounding the incident. And the act has been previously applied on a military base in Germany. In that case, it was a murder case and Germany wouldn't prosecute it the way the US would (specifically, Germany wouldn't consider the death penalty). 

As far as I know, the question still hasn't been definitively answered if the film would be considered child pornography in Germany. If it's not, then the question of citizenship becomes very relevant as to whether or not he can be prosecuted.

I would be a little bit surprised if German decides to take legal action against a US citizen who committed a crime against another US citizen when a US legal presence is close by and arguably has jurisdiction (according to the text of the act). </TEXT>

<TEXT> From [another article](http://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/bud-kennedy/article52749215.html)

"Back in July 2014, father and Lakeside sheet metal magnate Fred Couch had his own laugh. According to North Richland Hills police, he claimed to be a law officer.

At 1:15 a.m. on a Monday, according to the police report, officers interviewed Couch at a disturbance call and he identified himself as a Lakeside city reserve officer. He even said, I have my Lakeside police stuff in the truck.

Lakeside police say Fred Couchs badge was an ID for volunteers with a search-and-rescue unit.

One of the real officers had worked in Lakeside and knew better. But Couch produced a badge and credentials that looked official, police said.

Turns out Couch was never an officer, Lakeside Police Chief Lee Pitts said the other day. His credentials were for a long-ago Lakeside volunteer search-and-rescue team.

At some point years ago  nobody even remembers  they had this unit, all volunteers, said Pitts, the chief for nine years.

But they were never certified as peace officers. Nobody ever meant it that way." </TEXT>

<TEXT> But, in this case, the question isn't about age of consent. The question is whether filming the sex act was itself creating (and later distributing) child pornography. 

[Per 18 U.S. Code  3267](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3267), the [Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Extraterritorial_Jurisdiction_Act) applies to dependents of US service-members when deployed overseas. Under this act, a US citizen in a foreign country may be prosecuted "for any offense that would be punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States."

Twelve people have been prosecuted under this act, all for violating US law while working overseas. 

For that reason, citizenship is very relevant because it means that the act would apply to him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a lawyer. 

It sounds like the person that did the filming is a US citizen, if he went to the same school as OP (if OP would be so kind as to clarify). OP goes to a department of defense school overseas, which provides education to dependents of US military members and DoD civilians. Given this, it's most likely that the filmer is a US citizen. 

If that's the case, then 18 U.S.C.  2251(c) would apply. It says, in part:

Any person who, in a circumstance described in paragraph (2), employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, or who has a minor assist any other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct outside of the United States, its territories or possessions, for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished as provided under subsection (e).

section 2 clarifies:

Snapchat is a US-based company, with terms of service that specify the choice of law as being in California. Assuming that their servers are also in the US, then the sexual explicit visuals depicting a minor were transmitted to the US. 

18 U.S. Code  2260 may also apply. 

If the two teenagers that had sex were also US citizens, it might be possible that they violated 18 U.S. Code  2423:

Any United States citizen or alien admitted for permanent residence who travels in foreign commerce or resides, either temporarily or permanently, in a foreign country, and engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.

and clarifies that illegal sexual conduct is "a sexual act (as defined in section 2246) with a person under 18 years of age that would be in violation of chapter 109A if the sexual act occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States". 

As far as I understand it, the [Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Extraterritorial_Jurisdiction_Act) applies to family members of military personnel accompanying the service-member on deployment "for any offense that would be punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States." In this case, I believe distribution of child pornography would apply.

<TEXT> Generally speaking, even 4chan removes child pornography when reported. 

Remember that the girl in the video went to high school on an American military base, meaning that she's a US citizen (or at least her parent(s) are members of the US armed forces). I'm not a lawyer, but I believe that means they're subject to US law. Under US law, this is child pornography.

edit: OP doesn't specify if the girl goes to his DoD school (and is likely a US citizen), or if she goes to another school. So right now it's hard to answer that part. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Taking away a major revenue source would definitely harm the cartels, but at the other end of your example are people who believe that ending the war on drugs would destroy the cartels completely. 

The cartels are run very much like a business. They have resources that some fortune 500 CEOs would envy: massive amounts of money at their disposal, a huge workforce that is willing to do anything their told, a sophisticated logistics and distribution network in multiple countries and the legal top cover to make sure that they can pretty much do what they want to do. That allows them to pivot to different (ahem) "business" opportunities. 

First we have to assume that the cartels are keyed into our political and regulatory process. I'd bet that the cartels as a whole know more about our political processes than the average American does. So they'll be able to see the writing on the wall regarding drug laws at the federal and state level. This gives them time to react to changing legislation, if they're not (pure speculation) influencing the political process as well. 

The cartels will do whatever they can do to maintain their current level of control and profits. Maybe they'll eventually lose, but take drugs out of their wheelhouse (which won't happen entirely in our lifetimes, I believe), they're going to pursue other criminal enterprises. Already, Mexican criminal groups are making $42million annually with human trafficking, which is a drop in the bucket compared to their current income from drugs. But I believe that human trafficking is one of the many crimes that will increase as drug profits go down. 

One of the cartels has already [started to diversify](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/17/drug-cartels-iron-ore_n_4978564.html), and drugs are no longer their primary source of income. Their primary activity is illegal iron mining, which earns them up to $1.4 million a week from that crime. Now, I'd prefer that they're engaging in illegal mining to drug crimes and murder, but this is a good example of how the cartels will adjust their business model, just like any corporation. 

Taking away their drug revenue will be a good thing to hurt the cartels, but it won't destroy them alone. And it won't happen soon, either. And as their income is slowly reduced, they will get more desperate and more violent. I believe that we (being the non-cartel world that is affected by the cartels) need to act sooner than reducing drug income alone would allow. The cartels think they're fighting a war, and they're equipped and trained to be good at it. I believe that significant non-corrupted and intimidated police action or armed response is necessary to reduce their ability to operate and loosen their grip on towns and regions. This will take away their manufacturing and logistics capability, which is critical to their operations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prove it, how? I think we can all agree that the cartels were involved- as far as I know, no one is seriously doubting that part. If the cartels are involved, the police won't be digging too thoroughly. And Nereo Patio Delgado is missing, so there's really not too much room to investigate even if someone were willing to ~~be the next victim~~ take on the cartels in such a way.

It would be great if the police in Mexico bashed in some doors and brought the specific gunmen to justice. But that's not how things work in that region.  

Ask all the questions you want, but there's no one that can answer them. We can theorize all we want, but the only part that's clear is that she had powerful enemies that had a vested interest in seeing her killed. </TEXT>

The MSRP is $39.95, but the local game shop rounded up to an even $40.

They call the cards Gorram and Shiney cards. The effects of the cards are about the same as the original- you might go to jail, advance to to go, things like that.

<TEXT> And I think you hit the nail on the head. The actual threat depends on the level of organization involved. In the middle east, there are multiple competing groups of different sizes and level or organization. This complicates things for coalition forces, but also supports your point that the more organized groups are generally the more effective. Of course we have to acknowledge that small groups or 'lone wolves' can be effective to a degree, as we've seen in Paris, San Bernardino and other area. Sadly, domestic terrorism already exists. 

If a domestic insurgency can become organized, I think there would be a very real threat. Much like in the middle east and vietnam, it would be hard to tell friend from foe and guerrilla tactics would be extremely effective (even if only to prolong the conflict). If they are unable to organize and you have multiple small groups, I think it would be addressed (ultimately successfully) by law enforcement.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You raise some very good points, but I think you're assuming symmetric warfare in your assessment. The US military has very few peers when it comes to direct military confrontation- tanks against tanks, planes against planes, ships against ships. This is why its adversaries tend to prefer asymmetric warfare. 

Vietnam's a good example of this- the vietcong avoided direct confrontation, using guerrilla tactics to level the playing field. Same thing in Iraq or Afghanistan, which has been going on for years using similar strategies. 

If there was a small group of insurgents within the US, and they were easily located and identifiable, you're 100% correct. They wouldn't last long. The US war machine wouldn't even apply at that point, since it's domestic and would be covered under Title V of the US Code. 

If things got bad enough to warrant Title X (that is, regular military unit) involvement, then I don't think it would be as easy as you might be suggesting. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I moved into a new house about five months ago, and we've been having plumbing issues since day one. The home is four years old, and I think we're the second owners.

The builders forgot to cap a pipe in the ceiling, so it was leaking. While they had it open, they also found that there was a leak on the water main. Both of those were installation issues, so they fixed those.

We have been having problems with the master bathtub, and we tried to go through the home warranty to get it fixed. From what I can gather, the valves were installed incorrectly, causing a leak. The warranty won't repair it because it's faucet related, so I'm stuck there. I tried to go through the builders again, since it was installed incorrectly, but they said the warranty was good for two years after installation and that the previous owners should have taken care of it. 

Am I stuck paying out of pocket for getting it fixed? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for asking!

He LOVED it! His eyes I finally finished getting everything files down and put together at about 6 (it was a lot of filing), and he woke up at 7. So I was a little tired, lol! But we spent the morning riding around the neighborhood (well, him riding and me running after him at least). He had a blast!

We used to live in the California desert, and there were these  horrible thorns everywhere. I don't know what they were from, but I'm pretty sure whatever it was was evil. Even with those special tubes, they would puncture his tires. It's much better for bike-riding around here :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Sanity check: older cat, tumor or eosinophilic granuloma complex </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My older cat, Fluffy (my son named her that because she's, well, Fluffy), started pawing at her mouth and doing this weird... Licking... Thing. Like she was having trouble swallowing.

I took her to the vet who thought he saw a mass on her tongue. $400 in tests later, he says that there is no sign of cancer elsewhere in her body, but her test results indicate that it might be eosinophilic granuloma complex. This is supported by the (not directly observed) mass on her tongue, but she doesn't seem to have sores anywhere else, and I haven't seen any indication of parasites.

So we're looking at sedation, more tests and maybe a biopsy and either exercision of the mass or a course of steroid treatments. But I'm not all that bright, and I don't really know what questions to ask or what to expect. Should the vet be able to confirm eosinophilic granuloma complex visually? We love her and don't want her to suffer, but we're really not sure what to expect (and the vet didn't want to make plans past Tuesday).

Either way, thanks for listening.

Update: The vet put her under and did a more thorough examination of her mouth. There he found symptoms that supported the eosinophilic granuloma complex theory. We started her on a course of steroids and she has a follow-up in two weeks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Out of context, I see where you're coming from. But recall that I was responding to a poster who found it worth mentioning that two people found an obscure sub on an obscure day (whatever that means). In my reply, I pointed out the different subs that linked here that have a combined ~10 million subscribers. I can see the confusion, so I'm glad we cleared that up. 

I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree about the plausibility of two people that have a personal connection to the shooting hearing about this AMA. 

/u/ragecry said:

You know what's funny? How two people in this obscure sub, on this obscure day, just happened to show up and know some victims of the Sandy Hook shooting!! Without giving any specific details either, just vague statements by anonymous users. How fucking convenient, their schedules must have synchronized with Dr. Fetzer's, for they were ready to chime in at just the right moment to stir up some hate, emotion and controversy.

He didn't use the word conspiracy, but his comment suggests that there was something behind the posts other than what was occurring on its face. If he's not suggesting a conspiracy ("a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful," in this case harmful to the message of OP), then it's very much off topic and inane. 

Anyways, I think we've run this particular topic into the ground :) Have a merry christmas, if you celebrate the holiday.  </TEXT>

My point was that this exposure (as evidenced by the increase in visitors) is a reasonable explanation for new visitors (who may be impacted by the subject) discovering the thread, and your data supports this. Again, to be clear, I never ever claimed that your traffic would approach 10 million. I said that showing this thread to up to 10 million people would explain how people close to the shooting could have discovered it, in a way that doesn't necessarily involve any conspiracy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me try to put it another way. This sub is not very popular, that's very true. So it stands to reason that this comment wouldn't get much attention. But what if you could give a direct link with an engaging title up to 10 million redditors? Doesn't it stand to reason that some of those 10 million would check it out?

That's what happened here. This sub is not very popular, but when it was linked in some of the very popular subreddits, it got a lot of attention. /r/IAMA alone has 9.9 million subscribers, so posting a link to this discussion in that sub is going to generate some more traffic. 

It's like having a local business in the mall. You might get some walk-in traffic, but no one knows you're there. But if you put a commercial on a national television network, you'd definitely get more traffic. 

Does that make more sense? </TEXT>

I'm not claiming THIS sub had 10 million views. I'm pointing out that a lot of people could have (and certainly did) see the link through more populated subreddits. If you look at the popularity of this thread versus the other five that have been created, that seems fairly obvious.

<TEXT> Ah, I see. So after spending millions of dollars and involving police agencies, medical professionals, federal agencies, acting firms and shadowy government planners, everybody forgot about this little detail. If they were allowing everything to be filmed, do you really think they wouldn't have faked that, too? I mean, they do it on television shows all the time- it's not hard. 

I suppose that you believe columbine was faked, too, since you never see 1700 students in the evacuation? 

edit: I just saw how many of my points you ignored, and instead went back to your long-held point about the pictures. What about the other things I mentioned, such as other mass casualty events, the images of other school evacuations and the number of people involved in your conspiracy theory?

<TEXT> Maybe you've never been a part of a mass casualty event. Most people haven't. It's chaotic, and nowhere near as organized as the fire drills and exercises that we try to prepare ourselves with. 

In this case, the evacuation took 33 minutes. During that time, children were walked to the nearby fire station. You can see some of them making that walk [here](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MBR5Ulc0geQ/U8xD7qaC2jI/AAAAAAAAA6U/-GFDpjaN2vw/s1600/shootingpic3_20121214143145_640_480%5B1%5D.GIF). You can see more children in a different area [here](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HOqIRQNOJgU/U8xI5pWLyGI/AAAAAAAAA60/I3NI4rQqbuc/s1600/0%5B1%5D.jpg). [Here's](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z55N99EX63w/U8xLBDrWGMI/AAAAAAAAA7k/SoT6mG_easU/s1600/evac9.png) some others. 

That's also assuming that all of the children were evacuated at the same time. That may or may not be true, I don't know. But there are different protocols depending on where the shooter is. Some may do what's called 'shelter in place,' which means staying in a safe location until the scene is secured. Others, those that may be in more immediate danger, may be evacuated immediately. 

You can compare this to Columbine. There are 1700 students at columbine. I've never seen a picture or combination of pictures showing 1700 students. Do you believe Columbine was a false flag operation for the same reason?

But, more to the point, how many thousands and thousands of people would have to be in on this hoax? We're talking about the schools that would have had to fake degrees for the adults. We're talking about friends and family members of the crisis actors who would recognize their loved ones on television. We're talking about people that would have recognized the children that were involved (and the children who would have to be trusted to keep that secret). We're talking the medical staff and examiners. We're talking law enforcement. We're talking the people that claim to have known the victims from areas outside of town. How is it that all those thousands of people have managed to keep such a secret for so long? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dr. Fetzer, in order for such a deception to be successful, a lot of people would have to be in on the conspiracy. The actors, their families, law enforcement, investigators, photographers, children, morturary and hospital staff, etc. 

They would have to commit to this for the rest of their lives, and the victims could never show themselves in public. Actors would have to explain their appearance on national, 24/7 news to friends, colleagues and family members- I have a hard time imagining a cover story that would stand up to all that scrutiny. And of course there's the alleged perpetrator and his family, who would also have to be prepared to keep this secret for a lifetime (and in the case of the shooter, try to avoid recognition). This would all be done without granting security clearances and relying only on non-disclosure agreements. 

How do you suggest that so many people have been able to support a conspiracy for so long? Or has anyone admitted to being a part of it? </TEXT>

DTMF signaling tones can also be heard at the start or end of some VHS (Video Home System) cassette tapes. Information on the master version of the video tape is encoded in the DTMF tone. The encoded tone provides information to automatic duplication machines, such as format, duration and volume levels, in order to replicate the original video as closely as possible.

<TEXT> You really never know until you're in a life or death situation. I spent some time in Iraq, and everybody seemed to have a plan for when they arrived. There were some that were planning out their heroics and drooling about all the medals they'd earn. There were others that were terrified and admitted (privately) that they were afraid they were going to run at the first sign of violence. 

The thing is, there really wasn't any correlation between what people planned and what they actually did when there were bits of metal headed our way. In that moment, all of the bravado and fears were stripped away and people showed what they really were. Some of the cowards were heroic. Some of of the Rambos ended up wetting themselves. 

War's funny that way. 

So you might not actually be a pussy afterall. And hopefully you'll never have to find out for sure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But what if we did? What if a very wealthy man gave a small portion of their wealth to a good cause, and we celebrated and praised them for it. It would probably feel good to receive such praise (in most cases), which would increase the likelihood of them doing it again. Maybe that's not pure motives in that specific case, but it's still a win for the world. 

And other wealthy celebrities see what their peer is doing and the response that it gets. Maybe they want that as well. Maybe they think about it and decide it's a good thing to do. Maybe they want the free press that comes with good deeds. Whatever the case, it's still a net win for the world. 

Honestly, I think we should be focusing on the kindness that happens every day. The media focuses on the bad stuff that happens (and there's a lot of that), and I really think that colors our perceptions of the world around us. I'd much rather have people doing good things because it's the right thing to do, but I'll still be happy when kids get their surgeries.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Newbie question about switching insurance </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-12 19:36:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've only been with two insurance companies since I've been driving, so only two companies in almost 20 years. I really don't know what I don't know. 

I'm with Geico now, and I really don't like my premiums. I can get better coverage through progressive for much, much cheaper. My next Geico bill is due on Jan 15, and it's their "double" bill for the start of the coverage period. If I switch to progressive on, say, the 14th, I won't have to pay a pro-rated amount for that, correct? I can't tell if the payments are in advance or arrears. 

Also, is it worth getting the snapshot thing? My wife doesn't drive much, but might start a new job soon. I was thinking about getting it for her car, since it's financed. 

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was there in 2003-2004, specifically at Speicher. I remember one time we were going up to Camp Korean Village (to the west) and we took a route that would take us over the Tigris. 

This was shortly after the main (?) Bridge was blown, so the engineers had set up one of those pontoon bridges in it's place. But we were escorting fully-loaded HETs, which could only cross one at a time due to the weight. So we spent a lot of time sitting still. 

I was the gunner in one of the humvees, and this was before we were fully up armored. So I had the 50cal and a few plates bolted behind and to the side of me. The streets were busy and narrow. There were Iraqi police here and there wearing ski masks and carrying weapons. It was  surreal. And it's a very vulnerable feeling to have so many locals walking around and watching you so closely.

Suddenly, I saw movement behind me. Bad movement- the kind that sets off a red flag even if you don't understand why. The type that you learn to watch out for, because anything unusual could be bad. 

I whip around in the turret, letting the barrel of my 50cal lead the way. It feels like it takes forever to realign myself, but it couldn't have been more than a moment. And then I see it- a revolver pointed right at me. And then I see who's holding it. 

A child. A god damned child. 

He couldn't have been older than my son back home. His knuckles are white and the barrel is shaking. His eyes get wide. He looks down the barrel of my 50, just like I had looked down his. 

Instinct and training take over. I lower my profile and switch to my SAW (squad automatic weapon, or m249. Less penetration. Better for a dense environment). I do the math in my head. I remember what happened to someone else not long before. If I shoot, we lose the route and the village. If I miss and hit someone else, I just made more enemies. And fuck if I want to shoot a child. 

All this was in the span of a moment. He turned and ran into the crowd. No one stopped him. No one helped him. He just disappeared into the sea of people that didn't even see the tense moment that had just unfolded. 

I think about him sometimes. Did he ever try again? Was he successful? If so, am I to blame for their death? Where did he get the gun? 

I know what I was in his eyes: I was the monster that was in his village with guns. Maybe, to him, I was the person that killed someone he loved. 

Guess I'll never know.

<TEXT> I wasn't really terribly familiar with the British space program, so I had to wiki it a bit. It was interesting reading about Project Juno in the early 90s, in which private funding was raised using a lottery system and corporate/private donations to send the first Briton into space. It really sounds like the British, in general, have a lot of interest in space (especially space tourism). I think that counts for a lot, and enough pressure by the citizens will hopefully spur the government into re-energizing your space program.

I know you already know the answer (being a rhetorical question and all), but politics. We're better. We've gone further. We're more innovative. Our Nazis are better than their Nazis (quoting The Right Stuff, for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, lol). 

I really hope that we can continue working together in an international arena because, as you said, we're really all striving for the same goal. Honestly, I'm glad that we're currently working with Russia and think it's been good for both programs. On the other hand, a public/private partnership is going to be great for NASA and the US program. Can't we have both? </TEXT>

When you look at the national [contributions to the international space station](http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/assembly/component_view.pdf) (something that I get the feeling you're already familiar with), it really hits home how the different nations contributed to the endeavor. And obviously Russia saw a benefit to international cooperation, too. I don't know the politics of it, but that leads me to believe that the contributing nations all saw that the others had something important to offer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that's the major disconnect in the conversation (overall in this thread, I mean). 

NASA **is physically able** to launch a manned flight now using technology from their own inventory.

They are **not permitted to do** so because of their own (and ULA) safety requirements and budgetary decisions. 

If the astronauts were in trouble on the ISS and Russia was closed for the weekend, NASA would get a manned flight up there in short order. It sounds like we're all in agreement on that point, but you're right that they've made different budgetary allocations based on their strategic goals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're very correct. NASA decided it wasn't worth the expense of gaining man-rating for that platform. And I agree, when there was a lesser-powered option sitting in Russia. It's more than capable of obtaining certification for manned flights, but it's so overpowered that it would be a waste of money.

edit: I'm not sure whatever came of the Atlas V HR certification efforts from 2012, but I don't think that was completed either. It's worth noting that the original ISS flights and space shuttle launches weren't human-rated either, because the requirements were put in place after those flights. It's my understanding that the human-rating requirements are established by NASA and by the ULA (a joint venture by Boeing and Lockheed Martin). If there was a compelling reason to launch in the very near future and Russia was unable to assist, the technology would support it if the regulations were removed or changed. </TEXT>

My personal belief is that the race to the moon was an attempt by both the US and Russia to seize the symbolic high ground during the height of the cold war. It wasn't necessarily a tactical or strategic victory, but rather a symbolic one. 

Maybe the goals weren't as altruistic as the politicians on both sides claimed, but it did wonders for our technological advances. </TEXT>

I will grant that they couldn't launch today, but I would argue that they could in short order using current technology in their inventory if properly resources.

We're both obviously quite passionate about space exploration, which is a good thing!

But our conversation evolved (as conversations sometimes do), and I felt that it was a good one. I also think that it's found a mutually respectful conclusion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, there were multiple factors, sure. But it still comes down to cost. With sufficient budget (which we both agree doesn't exist), they could have built a suitable replacement. But they chose to allocate their funds elsewhere (smart choice) and used a launch platform that already was in place (the Russian systems). It was a cost-effective solution made for budgetary reasons. It's still very possible to achieve man-rating for the DeltaIVH, but there's not a financial incentive to do so. It's like driving a semi truck to the store when you can just borrow your friend's sedan. Why buy your own car when you can just use  your friend's? Keeping with the metaphor NASA has been focusing on heavy loads precisely because they found a relatively inexpensive solution for 'short' trips. 

But I suppose we have different perspectives of the same situation. Frankly, I think that a public/private partnership is a great solution, whether it was originally the intent or not. I respect your opinion, I just disagree with your conclusion.

edit: I would also add that the NASA CAIB recommended moving the retirement date out to 2020 in their post-Columbia disaster report. This would call for a re-certification and service life extension program to extend the shuttle program past it's original date. NASA eventually chose to non-concur with the recommendation to free up precious funds for the other goals under the Bush Administration Vision for Space program of 2004.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not accurate. The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is in [node 3 of the ISS](http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/assembly/component_view.pdf), which was built by the US. If the Russians removed their contributions, they would have a lot of trouble without the solar panels and habitation modules (both US).

<TEXT> Only because there's not a need for it when there's a cheaper alternative. 

Remember that the space shuttle was used up until 2011, which didn't rely on Russian launch systems at all. They stopped using it because of the cost and because it was an aging technology that had a suitable, low-cost replacement. 

I think we're really saying the same thing. I'm saying that they technically/technologically can, but aren't. NASA isn't using US technology because they don't need to- there's something cheaper that's available and optimized for human flight. They could, with some effort, resume using US technology for manned flight if there was a good reason to do so. At the moment, there simply isn't. But deciding to use the American private sector instead of Russian space program is their way of balancing cost with capability.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why wouldn't they? If it's cheaper to use existing rockets that are technologically sound, that's what NASA will do. It's not like we're at war with Russia, so why wouldn't they use their launch platforms? The Delta IV heavy is more than capable of launching a manned crew, but it's overpowered and expensive compared to the RD-180, which can only handle relatively light payloads like human crews. 

NASA has a limited budget. They're going with the least expensive option. Doesn't that make sense to do?

Yeah... no. 

They refused to process the return unless it was on their terms, and then we noticed three missed calls (from a MagicJack number in Florida) over the course of an hour. The last call was this voicemail message. 

I bleeped out her name for privacy. Apologies for the poor quality. 

I called Amazon and they confirmed that they didn't call. So I guess her account is safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> do the people buying the house tend to use certified cheques?

I've never bought a house with cash up front- I think most people tend to borrow the money in the form of a mortgage. When the loan is approved and funded, the financing company gives a check to the seller's mortgage company to pay off the home (if applicable) and the rest goes to the sellers themselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you ever purchased commercial insurance? If so, have you read the actual contract? Insurance covers damage. There was no damage, but there were cleanup costs. The cleanup costs had to be paid from someone, and I (and apparently the family in this news piece) think it's best when it's not the victims. Do you disagree with that point? You didn't quite answer that question.

Who made the decision

I don't know. No one knows, except for the family. Do you?

Don't even start sith the race card mate

What? Where did I mention race at all in any way that could be considered playing "the race card"?

I'm really trying to figure out your point. Are you upset that it happened? Are you upset because you don't feel the story is newsworthy? Are you upset because you feel that there are better causes, and don't agree with how this money was spent? With no disrespect, you kind of seem to be all over the map here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would be unfortunate if it wasn't, but that's definitely a possibility. 

Unfortunately, the Jihadists are hoping that people will isolate the moderate Muslims, who will then be prime targets for radicalization. And not the good kind of radicalization, with skateboards and pogs- the bad kind. There's a lot of that being discussed in government white papers and intel-type groups, and I get the strong feeling that you've taken the time to educate yourself on the terrorist motivations and tactics. So acts like this (genuine or not) can actually end up doing a lot of good. Or at least help avoid a little bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was actually speaking in more general terms. I apologize for being unclear on that point. 

In this case, there was still a cleanup cost. Sure, it was only $150 and the congregation could have afforded it, but that really wasn't the point. The point was that someone (whether the child or his parents) didn't feel that they (edit: they = the congregation) should lose out on any sum of money due to the actions of others. 

And it sounds like we're on the same page with the point I was meaning to make- that if there was significant damage done to the mosque (such as being burned to the ground) that people of all faiths helping rebuild would be a good thing. Do you agree with that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought I was fairly clear in my original point. I'm not being coy. 

No, mosques are not subject to constant destruction and vandalism. I didn't say anything even close to that.

Sometimes, yes. When a church gets burned (which has happened recently, remember), is it a bad thing when the community bands together to help rebuild it? Many churches and mosques are paid for and supported by their local communities. I don't see a problem with people of any faith helping to restore what was damaged out of hatred. Do you? </TEXT>

For example, I saw a gig on fiverr advertising logo design for $5. But for additional fees, you could remove the watermark, get the large version (the $5 version was tiny), get the source files, etc. 

So you can get decent work there, but it's just another freelance site now </TEXT>

<TEXT> Contrary to common belief, checks don't clear when you receive the funds. It can take a little while to settle between the banks. This scam takes advantage of that fact by having the victim deposit checks into their own account, then give the money back to the scammers (often thinking it's different people). Eventually, the checks bounce and the money is taken back out of the victim's account. 

So you'd end up missing a lot of money and they'd simply disappear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was that ever the debate? Did I miss someone making that claim? 

Personally, I've never had car troubles that prevented me from getting to work. If I did, I would use leave to repair it. I really don't see anyone making a claim to the contrary... please feel to correct me if I'm incorrect. 

edit: just read through. I still don't see anyone saying that the business should pay an employee but can't show up to work for whatever reason. Some people don't get paid absences for any reason, so they lose money if they can't get to work. The argument that you're replying to seems to be that the person who caused damage to someone's car should be liable for that lost income. Do you disagree with that?

sigh. edit to your edit. Please point out where I said that the employer is responsible for me getting back to work. Go ahead, quote me. I don't think you can, because you seem to be reading into things that people aren't saying. Do you have these problems a lot? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally speaking, you're correct. The problem is that they wrote the question to eliminate any wiggle room. If memory serves, it's something along the lines of "within the last 7 years, have you used any illegal drug including marijuana," or something to that effect. Even if you only tried it once, the only accurate answer would be "yes." I suppose you could ask the investigator what they consider to be "use," but u suspect that they would specify that trying it once meets that definition. 

As an interesting aside, there's a lot of discussion on how to handle legally prescribed medicinal marijuana. The current guidance is to answer "yes" to the use question and explain that it's prescribed by a doctor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The other perspective is that you may not lose your clearance if you admit to drug use within the last 7 years, but you absolutely will if you're caught lying about it. You probably wouldn't get caught, but if you do you're sunk. If you do choose to lie, make sure your friends da and family members that may know about it are willing to lie, too (note: I really don't recommend going down that path). The other consideration is that if you ever get a poly, it may come out that you lied on the previous investigation (and yes, I know polygraphs are very unreliable!)

Tl;dr: you will be asked the question specifically. If you lie, you might get away with it. But if you're caught you will not get a clearance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on how old you are now, but I'm assuming this happened within the last seven years. The specific question on the SF86 is:

"In the last 7 years, have you consulted a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with another health care provider about a mental health related condition?"

If I recall, the question has since been modified to exclude issues related to PTSD or reintegration after a military deployment. 

There are some things that will automatically disqualify you for a security clearance, but this is not one of them. If you answer yes, the investigator will ask for more information. Be honest with them and tell them what happened. More importantly, tell them how you've turned your life around and are no longer a risk. 

The investigator does not make the decision- the entire packet goes to the activity commander who will decide if they want to grant you a clearance. Frankly, I've seen people get high-level clearances with much worse than a suicide attempt at 16.

Please don't misunderstand; when I say "worse" I'm not minimizing what you went through. I'm talking about it from the commander's perspective. They want to know that you can be trusted with government secrets. Large debts (which could open you up to elicitation) are a much greater concern than teenage medical emergencies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But maybe not all of them did know that. Remember what they were told from birth- that the Treaty of Versailles was unfairly punishing the country and that they were being blamed for a war they (that generation) had no part in. All that tension is just seething under the surface, and you're reminded about it often. 

You know, because you were told, that your country will be invaded by Russia sooner or later. And when it happens, Poland and Czechoslovakia will cooperate with the attackers and allow them past your borders. That might sound far-fetched, but the rest of the world appears to agree. They allow you to annex  Czechoslovakia to protect yourself. Maybe there really was something to those claims, you might think, if the rest of the nations are allowing you to take the country. 

But then, it gets worse! Poland attacks a radio station within your borders and kills your countrymen. And then they murder a woman in Katowice. And they attack a railroad line and a customs station. It's nothing less than a campaign of murder and sabotage. It's an act of war, and it's plastered all over the newspapers. This is what you learned would happen- thank God you stopped Czechoslovakia from doing the same thing! 

Of course, you don't know that the whole thing was [engineered by Germany itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Himmler) to justify a war. Instead, Goebbels is talking about how regretful it was that they had to do such a thing, and that war had been a last resort. But the brave soldiers that were protecting the nation from a direct attack had won a quick victory, and Germany can finally have peace and be secure. 

The rest of the war, as far as you know, was a brutal reaction from the rest of the world to your justified defensive action. You're not fighting to expand Germany's borders- you're fighting to keep the western powers from destroying your country and those that you love. You're not the villain. You're the hero.

Of course, not every German soldier had such beliefs. But they didn't have the benefit of mass, relatively reliable media like we do today. Instead of the internet, they had radio and newspapers. They might have the benefit of rumors, but all they really knew is what they were told or could observe. 

I know you've already heard several examples of German soldiers doing the right thing when they see something bad happening. That's where the choices are made- when they finally learn that they've been lied to. Remember that the average German soldier wasn't a Nazi, and they certainly weren't privy to the party's plans. 

You're obviously very passionate about doing the right thing, and you're clearly willing to stand by your principles. That's a good thing! Remember that you have many benefits that a young person in 1920's Germany wouldn't have had, so it's really hard to actually put ourselves in their place. The best we can do is stand up for what's right in our own lives, learning from the past. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, Disney is well known for hiding subversive messages like this in their cartoons. 

When Ariel lost her voice, or symbolized her being afraid to speak about her homosexuality to her father. When Cinderella marries Prince Charming, it's clearly because she's only conforming to societal expectations despite her true nature. And the arrow scene in Mulan is supposed to remind us about the time when we all saw our camp counselor's penis after we snuck over to the counselor's cabin after lights out and peeked in the windows. 

So given their history, it totally makes sense that Elsa was gay.

<TEXT> Tor itself is secure, but the users on it might not be. You're referring to The Hacking Team's browser exploit that targets the customized Firefox browser used as a part of the Tor browser bundle, which requires the target to be identified and compromised first. That can be hard to avoid, but it's not necessarily a flaw in the routing protocol itself. Another way is for a server to be compromised or for your browsing habits to give you away (logging on to your Facebook account in the same session, for example).

So Tor is pretty secure, depending on your usage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember having this conversation over and over again a few seasons ago. Was Carl right or wrong to shoot Jody? I think this episode is a bit of a parallel to that decision. 

When Carl shot the wolf in the leg, he walked closer to the wounded man (by the way, why?? You have a gun- that gives you distance). The man was begging for mercy, but when Carl got close, the wolf attacked. Carl hesitated, and he was very nearly killed for it. He didn't hesitate with Jody, seeing as he was nearly within reaching distance (and was coming closer). 

Does anyone else think the same thing would have happened if Carl had hesitated with Jody? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll just play [devil's advocate](https://postmediaprovince.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/devils_advocate_500.jpg) here for a moment. 

The school was competing to win money from a company. This money was to support educational goals. I assume that showing support for the product was either a condition of the contest or increased their odds of winning. 

So maybe the school chose to see those two student's support for the sponsors competitor as a form of defiance that was hurting the rest of the students. I would imagine that students that dressed normally that day weren't punished, so support of the corporation wasn't required although opposition to it was punished.

I'm not saying I agree- not by a long shot. I'm just saying that the school probably saw their chances to win a grant being diminished and handled it inappropriately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was overseas once, years back. We had a lot of guys talking tough about what they'd do in a firefight. How they couldn't wait to shoot somebody and earn a medal.

It was funny to see some of them cower under a desk when the first mortar landed. It was also inspiring to see some of the folks that were originally nervous stand their ground and man their post despite enemy fire.

<TITLE> [AL] FOIA for state trooper dash cam after paying a speeding ticket </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-14 23:14:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was traveling through Alabama with my family, on my way to DC from California. That's one hell of a move. A blue car flies by me, then takes the first exit and disappears. I didn't think much of it until a state patrolman comes up behind me and pulls me over, saying I was going 95 and weaving in and out of traffic. I wasn't; I had the cruise control set for the speed limit because Waze warned me of a cop in the area. But I knew that arguing wouldn't do me any good. It wasn't until later that I put two and two together once I saw that he marked my silver car as blue on the ticket.

Alabama doesn't have a trial by declaration option, so I'd have to travel from DC to Birmingham to fight it. Or I could hire a lawyer to do it for me, but either way it looks like it'll cost more than the $300 to just pay the ticket and take traffic school. Plus, if I hire a lawyer and lose, I'd have to pay anyway. And I'd bet the cop would be able to explain the whole silver/blue thing.

I really don't mind paying if I actually do the crime, but it bugs me because I know that he was chasing the other car. And I'm a big fan of 'the principle of the thing.' 

I know that I can't get the dashcam footage before the trial, because it's an active investigation or something like that. But if the camera footage was saved, I think there's a good chance that it might show the other car. If I request it after I pay the fine and it shows the other car, would that actually do anything for me?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [SPOILERS] Nick's seizure </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-02 17:01:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Does anyone else thing that Nick might have faked his seizure? He was trying desperately to stop his sister from leaving, knowing that she'd die if she did. Maybe if he wasn't going through withdrawals, he could have stopped her. But in his state he could barely stand. So he begged, pleaded and debated with her, but she still left. 

I think he used the only tool he had left. He knew that she'd come back if he was in danger. Being already sick, he'd have no shortage of vomit and he knows what a seizure should look like. So maybe he faked it to get her to come back, saving her life. 

Of course, the flaw in that theory is that he couldn't have known that she would hear him fall. But he really didn't have anything to lose by trying, so maybe his gamble paid off. 

When he (secretly) told their mom that she tried to sneak out, they seemed to focus on his expression when he said "I stopped her." He didn't say, "lucky I had a seizure then." It just seemed a little too intentional on the part of the camera work. He seemed proud, or maybe he was just saying (correctly) that he stopped her from leaving, even if he didn't do it intentionally.

Or he just had a lucky seizure. But I choose to believe that Nick's just that resourceful.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I bought my wife the purse she wanted as a gift. She was very excited about it... Until it arrived. 

It was a pretty lousy product. She tried to like it, but she just couldn't. So we try to return it, and that's where the stress began.

First they told us that they have a 25%  restocking fee. I don't know much about amazon, but I think that's higher than the 20% allowed by Amazon. I asked them about that, but they said they're not bound by Amazon's policy. I don't know if that's true or not, but it's not much of a difference if so.

I object, and finally they offer a $30 credit as a "reimbursement" to "cover the restocking fee" since their system won't allow them to waive the fee. That sounds like a copout, but whatever- drive on.

So we're finishing things up, and they tell me the credit is for their store only, and that it can only be used by us. I really don't see how that dies what they promised, and I really don't have an interest in buying from them again.

Should I just take the 75% refund and ship them the product (at my expense), or is there a better way to deal with this company? 

Edit: sorry! I reread the exchange, and this is NOT FBA. I apologize for the mistake.

<TITLE> Does the CAN-SPAM Act apply to government agencies? </TITLE>

<TEXT> [Maryland / USA-wide]

I think the key phrase might be 'commercial,' but I'm not sure. Does the [CAN-SPAM](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-103) act regulate how government entities send out mass emails? If not, are there any other legal requirements for sending out mass messages regarding new services to those who didn't specifically opt in to receive the messages (assuming there's no method to opt out).

For example, can the Department of Education send out mass emails about new loan programs? Or can HUD send out tips for getting a mortgage?

Thanks!

edit: according to [this article](http://www.afpnet.org/Audiences/PublicPolicyIssueDetail.cfm?itemnumber=1390), non-profits are covered under the act as well if they're sending out a message advertising a product or service, even if they're not making a profit. I guess that makes sense, since money will change hands. But I'm still confused about what happens if a government agency is advertising a product or service that has no cost associated with it... </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Update] [MD] "Home Seller Wants to Replace Washer and Dryer </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-21 20:02:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Update to [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3a1lzv/home_seller_wants_to_replace_washer_and_dryer_md)

I know it wasn't a big or exciting story, but we all love a little bit of closure. Just to recap, the home sellers said they planned to replace the washer and dryer set that was shown in the pictures, installed during the tour and specified on the contract. 

They wouldn't respond to the question asking what they were proposing to replace it with, and did end up installing a new washer and dryer without approval. Finally, they answered my realtor saying that the new washer and dryer was installed. They had taken out their fancy set (seriously- wifi on a washer and dryer? Very fancy) and installed one of those double-decker sets work about a third of the original set. It was smaller, had poor reviews and wasn't valued the same as even a used replacement. My guess is that it was the set from wherever they moved into.

So we refused to proceed until they agreed to follow the contract. Part of that was because I thought it was fair that they do what they agreed to do, but I also didn't want to set precedent for letting them violate the contract whenever they wanted to. Their realtor finally called mine back and said that he "didn't think it was a big deal" and that he "does it all the time." But she held firm, and we agreed to accept a gift card for a national chain that sells the washer and dryer we want. It's not exactly valued the same as the set they took out, but it's definitely enough for what we want. Seemed fair, since the set they had in the home would have been technically 'used' anyway. 

So all's well that ends well, and we close tomorrow.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This project was fairly well-developed when my original partner disappeared. The risk of collaborating online, I suppose. 

I'm looking to develop a site similar in function to freelancer.com, but targeting a niche market. There is not currently direct competition targeting this niche. The primary competition that DOES exist does not target any particular niche.

I believe that a high profit potential exists, particularly given the low overhead. I will be covering the domain and web hosting costs, and other reasonable costs as they come up. I will also handle the business functions of the site (with full transparency), including building the stable of subject matter experts, attracting clients, etc. We can work together on marketing from our different areas of expertise. 

I could hire someone to build the site, but I think working with someone would be better in the long run. That way, we can adjust to a changing landscape as needed. 

For myself, I hold an MBA and an undergraduate degree in business management. I've started two moderately successful small businesses (which I stopped working on years back due to availability) and a non-profit organization. 

If you're interested in working together on this, please let me know.

<TEXT> We're in the process of buying a home. The contract has already been signed, and we've seen the home multiple times. 

A week or so ago, the seller's agent told my agent that they were taking the washer and dryer ("washer and dryer " is in the contract and shown / listed in the listing). Before she called them back, they called again and said to disregard that message.

Today, they announced that they will be taking the washer and dryer and replacing it with another set. I told my agent that is only acceptable if it's of equal value, since I'm sure they plan to take their nice pair and replace it with a much cheaper one. 

Do I have any grounds to ensure that the one that comes with the house is the same one or similar to the one in the listing and pictures?  </TEXT>

If the officer's dashcam was rolling in the minutes prior to the stop, I'd bet we could see the blue car. If not, I don't know if I could prove my case otherwise. Anyone here have any ideas about their policies or technology?

If this is the wrong subreddit, I'll happily delete this thread. Either way, thanks for any replies. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Withdrawing a mortgage application </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-04 21:01:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm in the process of buying a house using my VA benefits, and I'm really worried that I'll screw myself over by not paying attention. 

Currently, I'm working with Quicken loans and signed an application with them. I also paid a $400 deposit for the appraisal, which will be leaving my account on Friday. 

However, I think I've found a better offer- I'm waiting for a GFE from another company that swears they can beat quicken and won't have the unexpected fees that they say quicken is known for (and which I've already been surprised with once or twice). 

If the numbers are better, how do I properly withdraw my quicken application and make sure I get my deposit back? The agreement says that it will be refunded minus any actual appraisal or credit report costs. Is there a standard process, or do I just send an email or message through the portal?

Thanks for any advice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My son is 10, and already has a keen interest in entrepreneurship. I wanted to help foster that by helping him experience owning a very small business. 

When I was a kid, I had a lemonade stand. But I think that technology has created opportunities that didn't exist before. 

Do any of you have ideas for a small, inexpensive startup that can allow him to grasp the basic concepts? I was thinking a basic flipping operation, which should net him a small profit while teaching him about researching products, determining price points, etc.

Any thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Eleven year old debts and secret process servers... a bizarre, unfolding collections adventure starting in Nevada and ending in California. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-22 00:18:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this is what's going on for with a friend of mine. It's weird, so I'll just recount it as she told me. She knows I'm posting it here, so I'll relay questions and thoughts. 

Eleven years ago "Jennifer" lived in Las Vegas. During that time, she had a sprint landline, which she canceled after about a year before moving back to California. 

Yesterday, she gets a call from a company called HP Financials. I wouldn't bother trying to look them up- they don't seem to have much of a web presence. I heard part of the call, so I'll just refer to the lady that called as "Mildred," because she sounded like a Mildred. A Mildred that was past her "sell by" date. 

Mildred tells her that she has a debt with Sprint, and they're calling to collect. Immediately, they tell her that they've filed a lawsuit. It was like they went straight to the action and skipped all the foreplay. Normally I'm all for that, but sometimes you need a little finesse or a lot of alcohol before you can climb up someone's ass like that. 

So Jennifer tells the collector that there's been a mistake- that that account was closed years ago. The lady responds that the account was 'actually' kept open until 2011, and that's why they can collect. That would be convenient for the statute of limitations, but neither Jennifer or Mildred had anything on hand that could confirm that to be true. 

Now, normally I'm all for blindly trusting strangers that call up demanding money. And normally it works for me- that's why I've won so many UK lotteries and Nigerian princes know that I'm a trustworthy, god-fearing gentleman. But there was something about this lady that we just didn't trust. So we dug a little deeper. 

She calls Sprint. That was an adventure in itself! They couldn't find her account at all- not by name or social. And she didn't have the old phone number, so they couldn't look it up that way. But she's still pretty sure that the account was closed YEARS before Mildred wheezed that it was. 

So Mildred calls back today, saying that she needs to know if there's an adult home because she's having a uniformed officer come over and deliver some court papers. Jennifer asks "where are you?" (because it sounded like she was outside somewhere on a cell phone, and she was worried that Mildred was outside her house or something). And Mildred replies in a strange non-sequiter. She says that she has a "very heavy" envelope that has "court documents" inside, but she doesn't know what the say and can't open it. That was a little odd, especially since she said before that the uniformed officer already had the document. 

So it seems that there are court documents now. I've learned enough from this sub to go on over to both the original county and the current county court websites and see if anything's on file with them. Nothin'. There's no record that we can see. 

So her husband calls the number that they provided, hoping to get a little bit more traction. First two times he's hung up on. But the third time, he actually reaches Mildred! And before she can interrupt or launch into her spiel, he says that he's telling them as a courtesy that they're violating the fair debt collections act, and that they will be filing a complaint. He briefly explains how before she says, "well, the court documents are already with the server, and don't call again." Then Mildred hung up. 

So that's where we are. An old debt that may or may not exist, a process server that's gone rogue and a lawsuit that the courts don't know about. She knows to respond if anything (legal) does show up, and they've technically been told not to call, although I doubt there's a recording of that. Is there anything that she should do in the meantime? Anything she should watch out for? 

**TL;DR: collection company says old account was closed four years ago, when it was probably closer to 10. Sprint says they can't find the account at all, and the collections lady says a lawsuit's been filed but there's nothing on the court's website.** 

Edit: I should have dug a little deeper first. I looked up one of the numbers they like to use, and it turns out that company really likes to tell people that uniformed officers are on the way. So far, there are no uniformed officers at her house.

<TEXT> Hello, /r/AskDocs!

I'm writing a novel, and I always try to keep things as accurate as possible. 

When someone dies during surgery, what happens next? Do they put a sheet over the body and wheel them to the morgue? Or do they use a body bag? Do they put the body in the refrigerated drawers (I'm sorry, I'm sure there's a real name for those) or are they left out for a period of time?

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TITLE> My son's phone was taken during a field trip. Is there anything I haven't thought of? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-19 14:01:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My son went on a field trip to Griffiths Observatory yesterday. As he was leaving, he realized that his phone was missing. It wasn't in the lost and found, and no one else on the school bus had seen it. 

Unfortunately, it looks like the phone has been turned off, so I can't see anything or mark it as lost via android Device Manager. And, because I'm an idiot, I didn't install any tracking apps on it. I did check the location history, and saw where he went on the [field trip](http://i.imgur.com/UelTBtL.png); the SW leg is where I think the phone [went last](http://i.imgur.com/SelDXKi.png), at least when it was turned off. 

I'm not 100% certain of the time stamps. Google also shows that the bus took a [two minute detour down to LA](http://i.imgur.com/J3PINcS.png), so perhaps something's off there. Especially since it says it took about 2 minutes to get to Hollywood as well. 

Is there anything that I haven't thought of? I know not much can be done while the phone's off, but I'm hoping that it's turned back on at some point. I haven't disabled it through the provider because there's a lockscreen and I'm really hoping that the person who found it does the right thing and answers it at some point. I did call lost and found, but they haven't seen it. 

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, obviously this is a hypothetical question. Last night, I had a dream that some lovable scamps broke into a fenced-in area of my property, and were getting into my glittery purple El Camino. I caught them and wouldn't let them leave while I called the police and waited for them to arrive. I didn't restrain them, but I yelled or something. 

At some point, it occurred to me that I might be crossing the line. I figured it was false imprisonment or kidnapping or something. But when I woke up, I was curious- if someone (especially a minor) breaks into your home or property, what are you legally allowed to do with them (when self-defense isn't applicable)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The power went out in a portion of my house today, so I went to check the breakers. All the breakers were fine, but when I tested the AFCIs, one of them tripped and smoked and the other wouldn't reset. Those suckers are expensive, but replacing both restored the lights and some of the outlets. But the GFI was tripped and wouldn't reset. 


There are three outlets (including the GFI) protected by it, and none of them work. I tried disconnecting the load from the GFI, and it still didn't reset. I tried replacing it, and I could see that it's getting power (the new one had an LED- neat!), but it's still not resetting. I'm out of ideas, any advice? 

edit: I just replaced the batteries in my multimeter; I'm getting 123VAC coming from the line.

**edit 2: I'm really not sure why it's working now, but I took EVERYTHING apart (took out the breakers, removed the GFI, checked the connections and cabling) in frustration and put it back together, and it's working now. Thank you for your help!**  </TEXT>

I just landed my dream job in the DC area, but I own my home in California. So of course I'll need to sell my house- hopefully before the move, but I'm not holding out hope for that. I've done some research online, but I really can't make sense of the conflicting advice that I'm reading. 

So I hope you all won't mind the stupid question, but how do I sell my home? Do I just call a couple of realtors and "interview" them before signing on? Do I have to pay anything up front, or do I pay them (and the fees and stuff) out of the proceeds from the home? 

Thanks for any answers or tips. I'll be moving my wife and kids after the sale, so I really don't want to screw this up or cause unnecessarily delays.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> [California] Traffic accident; errors in police report that favor the other party. What do I do about that, and what does the law say about such accidents? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-10 07:18:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A week-ish or so ago, my wife was in a traffic accident. She was in the primary lane, and another vehicle was in the merging lane and was driving roughly parallel to her. Traffic was heavy, but my wife was maintaining a constant speed. The other party sped up and tried to swerve in front of my wife, but hit her twice on the front/right fender, leaving marks in two spots in the side of her car. The officer correctly notes in his report that the other car sideswiped her. The other car then entered my wife's lane halfway, then pulled over. When she rapidly entered my wife's lane and braked, they collided again, but there's nearly no damage from that one since they both reduced their speed immediately.

The police report (http://imgur.com/a/Fw6mJ [1] ) lists my wife as the cause of the accident. The officer seemed to take the other driver's story at face value, but it doesn't seem to explain how the damage could have happened to the side of both cars. The officer also took at face value that the other car was ahead, which isn't factual; that would indicate that my wife intentionally rammed the other car.

I feel that CVC 21658a is very clear, when it says "A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practical entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from the lane until such movement can be made with reasonable safety." The other driver did not signal, did not check her blind spot and turned into my wife.

The deputy will (hopefully) be calling me tomorrow to discuss my perspective. Are there any issues with his report that I can address? Can he document the other driver's statements as fact, even though no witnesses stopped and the officer didn't see what happened? Both drivers have differing statements; how can the officer make a definitive statement of what happened when he only has two conflicting stories?

**TL;DR: Car swideswiped my wife while merging; officer said it's my wife's fault.**

I'm trying to design a security awareness poster that will have pictures of five people and five short quotes.

Ideally, I'll do the same thing in a landscape orientation as well, but the portrait orientation poster is the most important one.

Do any of you have any suggestions or examples for how I can arrange it? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My son is 15, and has been diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia. He's also dyslexic, which only adds to his struggles. He's under the care of a psychiatrist and taking medication, which has helped a lot. Recently, his psychologist became unavailable and we're looking for a new one. 

What can his mother and I do to support him? Left to his own devices, he will literally play computer games and watch youtube videos alone in his room all day. The dad in me wants to restrict that and make him go outside or find other things to do, but I really don't know what's the best thing to do in this case. We try to understand that he might feel withdrawn, but we're not sure if allowing him to actually withdraw is causing more harm.

We just want to help him, but we're not quite sure how to best do that. He wants to be social, but doesn't seem to feel comfortable in social situations- he's gotten a lot better after the diagnosis and treatment started, but he still struggles with it. I'd really appreciate any thoughts or advice. If nothing else, it's good to talk about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know those scams you get in your email? The ones where someone wants you to smuggle millions of dollars out of Nigeria, just by giving them your bank account information? I fall for those all the time.

It's called scambaiting, and it's a fun game. But it can also be beneficial. Basically, you're keeping the scammers busy so they can't target someone that might ACTUALLY fall for their tricks. And you'd be surprised what they'll do, if you promise them enough money! I've had scammers sing to me, send me pictures, convert to "The Church of the Holy Phallus"... anything to carry on their scam. 

/r/scambaiting will help people like us bait the lads more effectively by sharing tips, resources and stories about some of the best exchanges. It'll be a place to swap photoshopped identification and western union receipts, plane tickets- anything that you might need to keep them on the line. I need a few mods to help me get the sub off the ground. Let me know if you're interested; I'll just need you mother's maiden name, bank account number and PIN.

<TITLE> "You looking at me funny, private?" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-26 22:45:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Years ago, I was in the army as a private; I was an E-nothing, so I had no rank and even less authority. So I was on convoy with this Sergeant- an E5 that had some chip on his shoulder for several not-very-good reasons. But he outranked me, so I did what he said. The convoy was at home-station, and it was simply moving equipment from one part of the post to another. It wasn't a combat convoy, and there was no traffic to worry about. 

The problem was, the guy was a dick. At that time, I was going through some rough times at home. My wife had severe medical problems and we just had a baby. So, naturally, I was tired as hell. While we were driving, I nodded off. I tried, I really did, but missing so many nights of sleep took its toll. He slammed on the brakes and proceeded to chew me out for falling asleep. Fine, I can take it. But he decides that it's not going to end there. When we got to our destination, he gave me another ass-chewing and had me doing push-ups to the point of muscle failure. Okay, maybe a little overboard, but it wasn't my place to argue. And, after all, I **did** fall asleep. So I took it, let him do what he wanted, and moved on. 

But he wasn't done. Every time he saw me after that, he found or manufactured a reason to 'smoke' me in the same way. One time, it was because I looked at him funny (He had this way of drawing out the words... "You looking at me funny, private?"). One time because I *didn't* look at him at all (apparently ignoring him). Sometimes, it was just because he thought I needed extra PT. I tried to avoid him, but he always managed to find me. And then one day- one glorious day- he left the unit. Moved on, went somewhere else. I was free. I moved on and moved up; got promoted a few times until I had my own stripes (I was in the transportation corps. We got blown up a lot, so promotions happened pretty rapidly). 

One of the duties of an NCO (Sergeant or above, on the enlisted side) is to do what's called 'staff duty'. It's a 24 hour duty where you sit in an office and answer phones, go to the clubs during closing to make sure no one's trying to drive drunk, checking doors, etc. You have a runner to help you out, but you also get some of the trouble-makers; the people that have gotten in trouble and gotten extra duty as part of their punishment. While I was getting briefed, they warned me about one in particular; he had gotten busted down a few times for hitting his wife, and attacking the MP's (military police) the second time they came out to break up a fight. Maybe not everywhere, but my unit didn't take very kindly to spousal abuse, and the other soldiers tended to take it upon themselves to make sure the abusers learn their lesson. And then he walks in- yup, that former Sergeant was now a private, just like I was. Those tables had turned. I wish I could say that I took the high road and maintained my bearing as a professional; but all that time of being hunted by this man came back to me. I probably could have let that go if he hadn't beat up his wife. I'd met her- she was a sweet, tiny little thing that didn't deserve what he did to her... twice. Sure, he got busted down in rank, but I felt that she deserved a little bit of petty revenge, which she probably couldn't get on her own. 

Our eyes met. He remembered me. He saw my rank, and his eyes opened wide. I smiled. "You looking at me funny, private?" </TEXT>

<TITLE> How can you determine when a rat has "memorized" a maze? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-25 21:42:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My third grade son is preparing his science fair project, and he had a question that I couldn't answer.

The experiment is regarding the effect of music on a rat's ability to learn. In this case, we have two rats and will make three mazes. We'll expose the rats to different types of music for a day each, then see if they can learn the maze more quickly.

At what point can we determine that the rat has learned the maze? Is the right metric the number of times they can run the maze before they can do it without a wrong turn?

Do any of you have any advice on how we can improve the experiment?

Thank you!

I searched through the site, but couldn't find anything specific.

Also, are there any considerations regarding posting flyers in public areas or handing out flyers on public property?

<TITLE> [Possible Spoilers] Prediction regarding Lil' Asskicker. I wonder if the writers have the guts. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-28 21:24:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not basing this on anything, so this is just my wild prediction.

I thought Judith was going to die from the disease. Sure, there's still time, but I think she's pretty safe where she is. Sooner or later, the group is going to be on the move again, and they'll no longer be relatively safe in the prison. I predict that they're going to find themselves hiding from a horde, desperately trying to keep quite and avoid detection, when Judith is going to start fussing.

Then, she'll cry. 

The walkers around them would hone in on the sound and starting looking for them, while Rick and Carl desperately try to quiet the baby. Everyone else will watch in horror as they fail to do so, and everyone will realize that they're going to die if the child keeps making noise.

Rick or Carl will have to smother Judith to save the group. They'll hope that she'll just pass out and they can revive her, but it won't happen. And that's when we'll find out if those born after z-day come back after they die. 

This was done on MASH, and it was a very emotional scene. I wonder if the TWD writers could do that? 

Edit: [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYjy7uUn7fc noredirect=1) is the scene in MASH. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work with a non-profit education group, and we're funded entirely by membership fees. These are fees- you pay money and get something in return.

How do some groups charge a fixed donation, and how is that legal? I see it a lot in the context of "pancake dinner, $5 donation" or something like that.

What's the difference between a set price and a defined donation (without the word "optional" anywhere to be found)? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does this mortgage refinance offer make sense? (lower rate and monthly payment by longer duration) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-05 21:01:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I received an offer from a third party affiliated with my home mortgage lender.

Currently, I am paying on $156,357 at 5.5% for the next 324 months, resulting in a monthly Principle and Interest payment of $927. The offer is for 4.250% rate (and says in parenthesis next to it, it says 4.31% APR) for 360 months, resulting in a claimed P I payment of 769. 

When I do the math, it seems to be a lower total amount despite the longer duration. Is this a good deal or not? If I plan on moving in a few years, I'd have a larger amount to pay off, so it seems like a long term benefit and a short term gain, with the only detriment being if I move.

Edit: this is an "IRRRL" that says it's reusing the entitlement from my original VA home loan </TEXT>

<TITLE> (California) Question about spousal access to IRA </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-16 06:39:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My mother--in-law's just begun what promises to be a bitter and painful divorce. In order to pay her medical bills, she withdrew $2000 that my father-in-law deposited into an IRA in her name using her social security number (or, rather, originally under his SS# in error, but changed it to hers long ago). There's currently $6000 in the account, but she only withdrew the $2000.

About an hour later her husband called her, angry that she had taken the money. He had called (most likely to try to take the $2000 himself) but was told that she had already done so. She's wondering if her husband was allowed to receive that information (I suspect yes) and if he's able to take the rest of the money.

Thanks for any information- it would really help put her mind at ease. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [California] In-laws divorcing; what can my mother-in-law expect? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-15 21:06:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, /r/legaladvice! Long time listener, first time caller. 

To separate fact from opinion, I'll start with opinion. My in-laws are getting divorced after 20 years. They both have a part in it, but the way my father-in-law (FIL) initiated it left my mother-in-law (MIL) in a pretty bad situation. He's never been a great guy, to his wife or kids, so this is pretty consistent with his character.

To stick with facts: About a week ago, FIL left the house and didn't come back. He calls MIL after a few days and tells her that he's filing for divorce, and that she needs to get a third mortgage on the house so they can sell it and split the money (That's relayed through MIL, so that might not be accurate), but then says that he might come and stay on the property but will not stay in the house. Yesterday, she received the divorce paperwork, which his mother paid for.

She's disabled, so she won't be able to provide for herself. And she hasn't worked for many years, so she doesn't think she can draw social security. She's agreed to see a lawyer for a free consultation, which should answer some of her questions, but there's some things that I don't understand:

Would she be able to hire a lawyer from the (little bit of) money in their joint account? Could he? Does the person that gets to the money first get the better lawyer?

She suspects that he has money that she doesn't know about- he never shared financial information with her. If he has "hidden money" and uses that to hire a good lawyer, is she just left at a disadvantage?

How are assets and debt split in CA? Their house is upside-down already, will they lose out on that? He has a few properties that he inherited from his father (he was out of the will, she talked to his father and patched things up so he was back in); how would that be treated?

He no longer works (retired) and has limited income. Would he be obligated to pay alimony after the assets are split (stocks, the property, etc)?

Thank you for any information.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> P.G.T. Beauregard, Civil War </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-14 20:16:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the US Civil War, the Confederate Forces under P.G.T. Beauregard found themselves severely outnumbered at Corinth in May of 1862. Maj. Gen. Henry W. Hallecks's army laid siege to their position with an overwhelming force of 100,000 men. However, upon reaching the Beauregard's fortifications, Halleck was struck by the apparent strength of the garrison forces. Camping for the night in order to consider strategy, he was concerned about the possibility of attacking a fortification with his own inferior numbers.

His concern was compounded when one of his commanders on the left flank of the position wrote that "The enemy is re-enforcing heavily, by trains, in my front and on my left. The cars are running constantly, and the cheering is immense every time they unload in front of me. I have no doubt, from all appearances, that I shall be attacked in heavy force at daylight." Similarly ominous were the imposing silhouettes of the Confederate artillerists standing by their guns, backlit by the many campfires.

It wasn't until the next morning that it was discovered that Beauregard's entire army, consisting of only 50,000 men, had retreated during the night. The retreat was orderly and methodical, and was masked by a train running back and forth along the Memphis   Charleston tracks, while the men cheered and played taps (the single band shifted from location to location during the night). To complete the illusion, fires were kept burning by a small group of men until morning, drummers were left to beat the reveille and stuffed dummies bravely manned the guns with painted on grins.

The Federal forces were prevented from comprehending the true intentions of the Confederate forces because key information was denied to them. In addition, Deception (often found hand in hand with OPSEC) was successfully used to mask the operation.  </TEXT>

The case study for the presentation addresses a penetration test performed against a large high
technology firm at their request. The goal of the test was to simulate an industrial espionage
attack, within the funding parameters. A comprehensive attack strategy was used to simulate an
attack as accurately as possible. The attack included the use of Open Source Research, obtaining
a position as a temporary employee within the target, misrepresentation of responsibilities by the
temporary, abuse of physical access, internal hacking, internal coordination and facilitation of
external hackers, and straight external hacking.

Anyone know any good examples of breaches (preferably that resulted in a loss of sensitive information) due to non-technical means? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My apologies if I'm in the wrong sub for this.

Does /r/webdev have any suggestions for a good free/open-source avatar for website visitor interactions? I recall finding one some time ago (but my memory fails me) that allowed you to program in the responses, but it was limited to specific questions paired to specific answers.

Are there any good avatar programs that can be easily programmed and have 'some' degree of AI? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm writing a story, and I've gotten myself (and my characters) stuck. 

There are four adults and two children in a wood frame military tent, which is itself reinforced and insulated by that spray-on foam that they use in the desert theaters. The door is deadbolted from the outside,  but there is no locking mechanism, and there are three ventaliation holes in the roof that are covered with a thin wire mesh. Inside, there are several cots, a battery-operated lanturn, a box of MREs and bottles of water. The ground is canvas over compacted dirt.

With a liberal application of fiction, how would you escape from that situation in a reasonable amount of time (like during the night)? </TEXT>

Do they actually cull it from rivers (it seems like you could only go down so deep before they're no longer smooth and attractive) or do they accelerate the natural process with high-pressured water? </TEXT>

What would the G6 be? The G6 can't be "Lead 6", because that's the Commander's call sign... What's a good one for the 6 element? 

Similar question, do "9" and "0" normally denote anything?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If one is writing a work of fiction, such as a short story or novel, what is the legality of using actual business or product names? 

I don't mean in a derogatory manner, so less of "Bob went to McDonald's, even though they support Al Qaeda and put ground up babies in their beef," and more "Todd hid in the Texaco station and ate slim-jims until the zombies passed."

How can one legally use real products or businesses in fiction? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I run a wiki page based on the wikimedia framework, and the spam has gotten really bad lately. I just don't understand what they're trying to accomplish.

Using random account names, they're editing the user talk pages with random gibberish, but most have "almost links". For example, one has some rambling incoherent text (surely generated), but then has:

    ?f=71 t=21239
    /User:Hb0rh6hr1gd#design_appraisement
    /User:Hb2dc2hr1wd#how_to_face_difficu

while another has

?tid=977444 pid=1067535 page=1 extra=page%3D1#pid1067535
?mod=viewthread tid=1328 pid=34164 page=37 extra=page=1#pid34164

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember there was a thread about this some time ago, where people were discussing what it was like to receive this notification. There's a law, at some level, saying that psychiatrists have to notify the potential victim when a likely threat is made. So if, in therapy, someone says that they're planning on killing their coworker, there has to be some level of notification.

It's not "mandated reporting", although that's part of the requirement. I believe it's a last name (a la megan's law), but I'm not sure. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is a strange one, at least for me. Apologies if this isn't the right sub.

I have a phillips flatscreen TV that's plugged into the DVR via the component cables. When I leave anything (so far the blue ray player, laptop and the xbox) plugged in, the TV will lose sound *sometimes* when it's turned on. Not every time, and the length of time it's off doesn't seem to have anything to do with it. If I unplug the hdmi cable and restart the tv, the sound works fine, and I can plug the cable back in with no issues.

Any ideas? </TEXT>

The challenge? Our IT folks have the computers on lockdown and I can't install any software, and windows movie maker isn't a part of the standard load. The process to get those things changed is a bit longer than I have available.

Does anyone here have any thoughts on what I could do here? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Full disclosure: I'm working on my capstone project for my BS in Applied Management before applying to the MBA program. 

How can one define performance metrics specific to a watercraft detailing company? Given the wide range of conditions and types of watercraft, I wouldn't think that time would be usable metric (specifically, one couldn't set a timeframe of three hours for a 26' boat and expect that to apply to a relatively clean and a very dirty boat!).

The only performance metric that I can think of is the final product- a random inspection looking for thoroughness. Even then, I'm wondering how to define that metric. 90% "clean" 99% of the time? passes inspection 95% of the time?  </TEXT>

I always hear that when you don't eat, your body might start eating the muscle. If I'm not eating much, but moving as little as possible, am I going to lose anything?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-11-18 01:57:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As we all know, Walmart employees are threatening to strike on Black Friday unless working conditions improve. Of course, Walmart stands to lose a lot of money and would have difficulty hiring replacements in that amount of time. Walmart also wouldn't want to face the PR nightmare that massive layoffs before the holidays would bring. Is it possible that they might keep their employees through the profitable holiday season, then quietly lay them off once it's over? There would be some outrage, of course, but not nearly as much as if it was before the holidays- customers would likely sympathize with the employees and would be angered by the impact to their shopping. Is it pessimistic or realistic to think that Walmart will merely placate their employees while it's financially beneficial?   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is killing me; I saw a video of this guy and would like to see the rest. He was doing stand-up, and it looked like some sort of special. He had red hair and I think facial hair (it wasn't Louis CK). He was doing a bit about parenting, and then said he likes to tell his friends with kids that he'd be a great parent because he has a dog and watch their reaction.

Then he moved into how he didn't realize that his dog was feeding off his rage; that he'd be yelling at the football game on TV, not realizing that his dog was in the corner chewing the hell out of his bone and "agreeing" with him. He was talking about taking his dog to the trainer, who told him that by racing the dog up the stairs and wrestling with it everyday, he was teaching him to take the high ground and fight for it every day, and then about going on walks with the dog.

I know that's not a lot to go on... any one know who this is?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> More than anything, I want to formally adopt my 13 year old step-son; I've been in his life since he was two, and both of us see our relationship as father and son. My wife (his birth mother) wants this as well, and the birth father willingly gave up all parental rights (which is a moot point, since he meets the criteria for abandonment anyways).

Last I looked into it, there was a very high cost to do so, and home visits to schedule... Since everyone wants the same thing, is there a less expensive way to get this done? Has anyone ever done this?

Note: I'm not requesting legal advice; anything anecdotal would be swell. Also, anyone's experiences with the process would be very enlightening!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've read the FAQ, and I'm confused on one small point regarding the relationship between Total Daily Energy Expenditure and my fitness goals.

The FAQ says that one should adjust their caloric intake relative to their goals- take in more calories than your daily "allowance" to build muscle, and reduce the intake to lose fat- by up to 500 calories on either side. 

My goal is to gain mass (which seems to require that I increase my caloric intake), but I have a little bit of a gut left that I don't want to add to. How do I build mass while losing body fat?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We're likely all aware of [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk0aqyMltRA feature=related) 911 recording, where 17 year old Jake Evans calls 911 to confess to killing his mother and sister. I was amazed at how calm and collected the operator was, and how she was able to put aside anything that she was feeling and focus on keeping the kid alive and diffusing a potentially dangerous situation before the police arrived. 

911 operators of reddit, have you ever been in a similar situation?

1. What was the nature of the crime?
2. What were you thinking while they were telling you what they had done?
3. Were they still a danger to themselves or others?
4. How did you keep them talking or diffuse the situation?
5. How did things end up, if you know?

Thank you! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It finally hit me today when I looked at a mural with a recycling theme (and with facts learned from a recent reddit posting on recycling); "reduce, reuse, recycle"- the words that were drilled in my head since childhood, are actually in order! Reducing consumption saves more energy than reusing products that were already created, which in turn saves more energy than recycling. I always thought that they were all equal, but I never thought of it.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Years ago, I worked at a gas station that also had a car wash. The prices were fairly reasonable, the cheapest was $4.99. An older gentlemen came in complaining about the prices, and completed his rant with "Well, I could just go downtown and get a handjob for that much!"

I was a well-trained, professional gas station attendant and managed to keep a straight face after well, at least until he left.

When have you had to keep a straight face against insurmountable odds?

Edit: he had clarified that he meant a "hand car wash" when he remembered the name of the place. A handjob in that town would have been at least a dollar more. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do endurance Olympic swimmers swim for hours without "refueling"? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-10 20:17:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Biology / Sports Science question:

The 10k Olympic swim event is on, and I was wondering how the athletes can continue to exert themselves without "refueling". You see runners and cyclists carrying food and water with them, because the body (AFAIK) simply can't store that much fuel; and the swimmers are slim enough that I can't see the body storing enough for the entire race.

Runners, cyclists- they stop to eat/drink or do it in-stride... how do swimmers condition their body to work so hard and so long without food or drink?

EDIT: Further on in the race, I saw the answer: they have water (with additives, maybe) lowered to them while they race and they backstroke while consuming it. TIL. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a step-son (13) that I love more than anything- he's an awesome kid, and I've been in his life since he was 2. I consider him to be my "real" son, but I understand the legalities and would really love to formally adopt him. His birth father is in jail for murder, and has already waived his parental rights. My wife agrees with the adoption, too. 

Have any step-parents of reddit done this, preferably in California? Are there any emotions that I/He needs to be prepared for? How can it be done quickly and without too great a cost? Any thoughts or ideas would be very appreciated.

Note: I'm NOT asking for legal advice (per the rules)- I'm asking for personal experiences. </TEXT>

My confusion comes from what you see on TV, when someone might not use chirper to send a brief "chirp" to their friends, while enjoying a refreshing Dr. Popper drink and waiting for their Pizza Tent delivery to arrive. 

How could you reference products in works of fiction without being sued or going for wacky names?

<TITLE> World hunger (including in your home country)... what can be done about it? [X-Post from Askreddit) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-18 17:21:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ask reddit came up with some good thoughts, but I realized THIS sub is a concentrated group of people with good hearts and great ideas.

I'm working on a personal project, and it includes coming up with an exhaustive list of what can be done about hunger, both foreign and domestic. This affects nearly 1 BILLION people to greater or lesser degrees (per worldhunger.org), so it's a significant issue.

What is the average person able to do about it? Big or small, what could -I- do?

I've thought of the following:

1. playing freerice
2. donating to one or more of the many fine hunger-related charities
3. donate to a soup kitchen / food bank
4. volunteer at a soup kitchen / food bank
5. urge your nation to keep their promise from the [Monterrey Summit](http://www.poverty.com/internationalaid.html)

Can reddit think of anything specific that could be done by citizens, rather than waiting for the government to do something? 

I appreciate any ideas.

<TEXT> From reading the accounts of war refugees, I've been very interested in the stories of those that have had to flee or go into hiding. I'd appreciate hearing the perspectives from anyone that's been forced into hiding or has been a refugee. 

1. How old were you?

2. What were you hiding from? What would have happened if you were caught?

3. What measures did you take to stay hidden? If you were hiding "in plain sight", how did you handle those around you?

4. What did you to to entertain yourself or stay busy?

5. Assuming you're no longer in hiding, what ended up happening?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-06-26 17:32:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I enjoy talking with my kids (7 and 13) about history, especially when they're able to realize that there's something "more" than they're learning in school. For example, my oldest was under the impression that we won the revolutionary war because, hey, we're freakin' awesome! He was surprised to learn about how the hessians had canceled their routine patrols due to weather and the role that the french navy played at yorktown. For a bonus, we discussed how the vilified Benedict Arnold nullified the British fleet at Valcour Bay.

It's not that I believe that the schools are failing to teach appropriately, but I do recognize that the teachers have a limited amount of time to cover a great deal of information- so it becomes the role of the parent to supplement their child's education with details and to instill a love for learning. What other commonly taught facts about history could be supplemented in such a way (or, in other words, "what's your neatest, most coolest history nugget??") </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Toucher" is the tragic modern day re-imagining of the legend of King Midas. Nicholas Thompson was born blind, but still lived a full life. He traveled the world as an employee of Dialogue Magazine, his monthly column demonstrating that the blind can live full, rich lives. However, when he's cursed with the ability to turn anything that he touches into gold, he quickly realizes that the vast riches that it brings him comes with a terrible cost- he can never again experience the world, and finds that he quickly forgets what it once offered him, including the face of his beloved wife.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Request: Assistance creating an outlook form for document coordination </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-20 18:23:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm in over my head here, and I have to put something together for my boss. Hoping one of my smarter-than-me redditor friends can help me come up with something.

I need to create a form that integrates with outlook 2007 to enable document staffing. Essentially, the user (there would be several, so finding out how to integrate it into outlook is another challenge) would be able to select "New" then "Staffing" from the menu to use the form. Then, the user would attach the document for staffing and select the recipients (like with checkboxes, which are linked to email groups). The user would also be able to add information, select a due date, add a POC and use a checkbox to show the recipient what to do (sign, review, etc).

Then the recipient would be able to select concur, concur with comments or non-concur with comments, much like the built-in voting buttons that outlook already has. 

I'm aware that you can create or edit forms and add them to the default list, but I'm not sure how. I was trying to base it on the meeting request template so I could see who's received it and their status, but it no workie.

Any tips or, ideally, already published forms?

<TEXT> It's driving me nuts! I remember a mythological story of an imp, demon, fairy or other spirit that likes to lure people to their deaths, like taking the form of a child or attractive woman to lure someone deep into the woods where they can't find their way out. It's not the sirens, but something more... playful. Any help? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think I found the Hadith that I was asking about earlier, but I'm afraid I don't really understand it. Could someone help explain what it means? It is saying that an action with a good intent is a good act?

I heard the Messenger of Allah:
The actions are Innama (only, certainty) tied to the intentions and every person will earn that which he intended. Therefore, he whose migration was for Allah and His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), then his migration will be for Allah and His Messenger; and he whose migration was to achieve some worldly gain or to take a woman in marriage, then his migration will be for that for which he migrated.

which I found at http://ahya.tripod.com/niyah.html. But I don't understand what it means. Could you please help educate me on this?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> 6 easy, effective things you can do TODAY to combat hunger  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-11-21 18:01:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> World hunger often seems like an insurmountable problem. But there are several things that you can do today in order to help make a difference. With enough people making a contribution, we can have an impact.

1. Play freerice (www.freerice.com). This quiz game donates ten grains of rice for every right answer through the UN food program. To date, millions of people have been fed through this game.

2. Urge your government to keep their promise. In 2000, all 189 countries of United Nations agreed to spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, to include hunger. This was followed by the 2002 Monterey Conference, in which the wealthiest 22 nations agreed to a certain level of international aid. See how your country stacks up [here](http://www.poverty.com/internationalaid.html) - only five have met their goal. Don't like it? Send a [letter](http://www.poverty.com/printletter.html) to your government.

3. Join a regional outreach effort. More likely than not, hunger exists in your community or the surrounding area. The hungry are not always holding a sign near the freeway- they're also the working poor that recently suffered from layoffs, or the single parent trying to make ends meet. Fortunately, your area has groups like food banks, the Salvation Army and other specialized efforts. You just need to find them!

4. Donate to the World Food Program. If you're able, a donation to the WFP goes a long way; the program has a [wall of recognition](http://wall.wfp.org/) for those that participate.

5. Encourage education. The WFP maintains [lesson plans and study guides](http://www.wfp.org/students-and-teachers) to help teachers effectively address the problem with students.

6. Encourage involvement through your place of worship, community group or friends. If they get involved in combating hunger as well, there will be a greater impact. There's power in numbers! </TEXT>

<TITLE> 10 quotes about world hunger
 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-11-20 21:09:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "If you desire peace, cultivate justice, but at the same time cultivate the fields to produce more bread; otherwise there will be no peace."
-Norman Borlaug

"There's enough food to feed everyone on this planet twice over, why, why, why are people going hungry?"
-Harry Chapin 

"If we can conquer space, we can conquer childhood hunger."
-Buzz Aldrin

"Peace can only last where human rights are respected, where the people are fed, and where individuals and nations are free."
-14th Dalai Lama

"It is important for people to realize that we can make progress against world hunger, that world hunger is not hopeless. The worst enemy is apathy."
-Reverend David Beckmann 

"School feeding not only fills stomachs, but has a proven track record of boosting enrollment, attendance and academic performance. For just pennies a day per child, this program changes lives  and ultimately can impact the futures of poor countries around the world in a profound way."
-Drew Barrymore

"When you give food to the poor, they call you a saint. When you ask why the poor have no food, they call you a communist."
-Archbishop Helder Camara

"35 million people in the U.S. are hungry or don't know where their next meal is coming from, and 13 million of them are children. If another country were doing this to our children, we'd be at war."
-Jeff Bridges

"Most of our citizenry believes that hunger only affects people who are lazy or people who are just looking for a handout, people who dont' want to work, but, sadly, that is not true. Over one-third of our hungry people are innocent children who are members of households that simply cannot provide enough food or proper nutrition. And to think of the elderly suffering from malnutrition is just too hard for most of us. Unlike Third World nations, in our country the problem is not having too little  it is about not caring enough! Write your elected representatives and promote support for the hungry."
-Erin Brockovich

"If we are going to stop wars on this earth, we are going to have to make war on hunger our number one priority."
-David W. Brooks, member, Presidential Commission on World Hunger

<TEXT> I feel very strongly about the problem of world / domestic hunger, and am working on a new subreddit for that cause. In order to highlight the human side of this issue, I would really like to be able to AMA someone that is suffering from acute hunger or starvation. 

This would be someone that involuntarily consumes much less than the required ~2100 calories a day and faces undernourishment. 

EDIT: I didn't, but should have, included people that at one time suffered from acute hunger or starvation, but do not any longer. </TEXT>
