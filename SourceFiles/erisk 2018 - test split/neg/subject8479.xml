<TITLE> What production companies or movies did actually pay fair wages to their VFX-artists? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 11:51:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was wondering about this, since the relationships between production companies and vfx companies in terms of payment/compensation seem to be horrific. Is this a Hollywood specific problem because of the lack of unions in these branches? And are there even "big" (say budgeted from 50m upwards) Hollywood productions that actually do pay their VFX contractors well? </TEXT>

<TEXT> While a decent fanbase really can help you with getting signed, most labels will not care about your following if you present them an awesome tune. I would recommend you creating a professional looking Facebook/Twitter/Soundcloud etc. though. An A R will want to check out those pages if they are interested in you. Proving that you're able to market yourself and your music is quite important to some labels from what I've experienced. Also if your music is good, social media is the only way to get audience in the first place and can serve as an indicator if your sound/style appeals your listeners. Still, at the end of the day it's all about making great music.

<TEXT> Here's some ("cheap") services I have used in the past:


- Splice.com does have a small but increasing amount of vocal packs that you can use for your commercial releases.They're the cheapest and easiest way to get high quality vocals i've found yet.


- Looperman.com, where you have to deal with the vocalists for licensing. There's some very nice and straight forward people, but most of them will charge more than 100$ per release (after what i've experienced).

- beatport, there are some nice and "for commercial usage" vocal packs of many genres which I've made use of. The quality depends very much and the price per pack is between 20-50$.


- fiverr.com, where I had a vocalist sing some original lyrics for me. In most cases you have to write them yourself though. Also, it's a fair amout of work to have the vocalist sing the lyrcis how you imagine them (which included singing the bit myself first, and several rerecordings on the vocalists side). Pricing is about 30 up to 200 bucks (I paid 105$).

Sorry for my not so good english. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use fruity compressor almost every time on my snare and sometimes on the whole drum bus to make it sound bouncyer. It helps to stick all the drum layers together.
I also have a slight compression in my mastering chain (about 1:1.4-1.6) to fit in the loudest parts of the track.

<TEXT> I started producing in 2011 and felt exactly the same a few months ago. I thought for the 5 years I am doing this I should be way better than I am. Then I just started forcing myself to learn about every single technical aspect I didnt understand. I gathered more knowledge in these (maybe 3) months than I did in the last 3 or 4 years. Its not like understanding these things is some magical secret. Its just about looking for information until you can comprehend the matter and using the knowledge you picked up in your new projects and experiment with what you get from it.


You already are in the right subreddit! Search for the keywords you mentioned above and just try to understand. If you dont, make a new post and point out whats confusing you.


A YouTube channel that helped me was [Composing Gloves](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0ahUKEwja0dbxupPPAhWMCsAKHZqEB6kQFggcMAA url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fcomposinggloves usg=AFQjCNE6rdHveAZR7Np_ijUBkLpgWE-Q5g bvm=bv.133053837,d.bGg). Check out his from the ground up-series.

Also, I read the [iZotope Mixing Guide](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0ahUKEwi5l6u5u5PPAhVlJMAKHRoKDyYQFggfMAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownloads.izotope.com%2Fguides%2FiZotope-Mixing-Guide-Principles-Tips-Techniques.pdf usg=AFQjCNFQMaoVfGNbifxyfWOyNtL843fe8g bvm=bv.133053837,d.bGg) which is a great resource for all mixing related questions.

I hope this helps you as a starting point and inspiration.

I like your track, gives a good summer mood. However, I feel like there's some (sub)bass missing in the drop. A simple sidechained sine wave playing the chorus melody would help make it "dropier" and fuller. </TEXT>

I made this as a part of an EP. Is it missing something? The track is still unmastered, since the EP is still to be completed. I am also considering sending demo tracks to labels. Do you honestly think my production quality is good enough?

<TITLE> A friends family took me to church today... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-10 10:04:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, a friend of mine is in one of those free-evangelical, "International Christian Fellowship"-churches. His family is very nice and admirable. They knew I was an atheist and were "okay" with it, however they offered me to attend their service today and as I am very interested in other world views (I was raised catholic and I have heard of their church to be very "progressive") I agreed to go with them.

This visit made me aware of how religion is keeping people back from being reasonable people. It was so frustrating! There was a part during the worship where the pastor asked the attendants to share their encounters with god and jesus and there was this woman in her mid-30's who had a brother with a bipolar disorder. Apparently in his worst moments he tended to abuse his kids. So this woman told about that and how she was considering calling the cops on him, or at least warning his neighbors so that if they hear something they could step between. She said she was praying to the lord for help, so she would make the right desicion.

What eventually came about was: She realised that god is watching us all and he will watch her brother and his kids and he will lead them. Interfering in gods plan would mean she doesn't trust in god. So she did nothing. She did literally nothing and was totally happy about her brother hitting his kids "because god has his plans". In disbelieve I looked at my friend and his father (who I usually admired for his reasonable and rational views/behaviour) and they both were fucking cheering to the story along with everyone in the building. I can't believe that in a highly developed society (I'm from Switzerland btw) there are people who are okay with a father hitting his kids, just because of a "god knows what he does" label on it.

I wish I had done anything, but I honestly am not the type of guy who leans up against a full room of people and I don't think it would have changed a single bit, so I just went home to write this post to process my last experience with christianity. It definitely opened my eyes in some way. Even an intelligent and usually rational thinking person will do the dumbest things if they think it's "gods plan" and I will never trust them in anything like I was to.

**TLDR:** Woman does nothing about her mental instable brother abusing his kids because she thinks "god will fix it". Church attendants are okay with it. I realize that religion is danger, even in first world countries and I'm not to trust religious people anymore.


**edit:** words   formating

**edit II:** turns out the "International Christian Fellowship" is only a thing in europe, so [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Christian_Fellowship) the wikipedia to look it up. </TEXT>
