<TEXT> Mine was from An Edible History Of Humanity by Tom Stoppage. There was a chapter about Norman Borlaug and the Green Revolution. Much of today's conventional farming techniques, which organic farming demonizes,  have humanitarian roots. It occurred to me that many of my friends and family who advocate organic consumption do it to distinguish themselves from poorer members of society who cannot afford the more expensive organic food. That realization (which I don't believe was Stoppage's intent) really turned me off of organic food. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to educate those who scream "free speech" that there is a difference between the government persecuting you for what you say and your fellow citizens managing social norms. The latter is no different than your grandmother flicking behind your after you said something rude. Having someone call you out on your inappropriate behavior is someone giving you that proverbial flick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The batshit is understandable. Let's look at this under societal norms. YOU are dating a mature older gentleman. That gives you some street cred. HE is dating a ninth grader (in the U.S.school system anyway). You won't see this until you get to his age, but when you do become 21 you'll look at 14 year-olds and realize that he is a predator.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, we had adoption sales (a garage sale with donated items from friends and family for the purpose of adoption) in order to help with the costs. But the supply and demand component has the benefit of giving more children families. There are couples who would insist on a white baby and pay more for that, and then there are couples who just want to love and raise a child, regardless of race. The fact that more "undesirable" (god, it makes me sick typing that) races are cheaper helps place more children in loving families than an across-the-board pricing scheme. I know of s couple who insisted on a white baby and gave up on the idea of children because they couldn't get a birth-mother to choose them. Their loss. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The adoption agency did a lot for the birth-mothers. Counseling, housing, childcare, etc for the last three months of their pregnancy. That plays a big role in the cost. The adoptive parents are responsible for the hospital costs too,  and since many women who choose to give up their children to adoption are not financially secure, they often don't have insurance. There is also a supply and demand component. The waiting period for white and Hispanic babies is often 5 years and twice the price of an African American baby. We were chosen for our first daughter in two weeks. The demand for AA babies is so low in the U.S. that many are adopted internationally by European and Canadian families. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who domestically adopted two babies from an adoption agency (the most accepted adoption process today) I have to say that the "human trafficking" problem is not so clear cut. Although we were chosen by the birth-mothers and have an open-adoption with them, we still bought babies with money, about the price of a mid-priced car (although that depends on the race of the child, but don't get me started on that). The birth-mothers never got a penny of that money. I would argue that the intent of the adoption is what dictates adoption vs human trafficking. Are you going to love the child as your own or are you looking for an indentured servant? Then again, are my children's weekly chores considered child labor? The rabbit hole of legitimized adoption vs child trafficking may never have a bottom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your perception of how much you put into the relationship, or how much you do in the relationship, will always be skewed. If you feel like you are putting in 50%, your spouse is carrying most of the weight. If you think you are putting in 75-90%, it's most likely equitable.

<TEXT> Ripple Effect martial arts is so geared towards kids and is so good for them that the only adults participating are the parents of the kids. They are wonderful to the kids and motivate the kids to do well in school (by giving out gold and silver stars on their uniform lapels). They compel the kids to start doing chores at home by requiring a certain number of "attitude stripes"on their belts before graduating to the next belt. As someone who grew up with martial arts, the teaching is good and kid centered. I wish had this type of school when I was a kid. </TEXT>
