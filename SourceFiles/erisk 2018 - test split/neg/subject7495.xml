But there were things still under investigation. The FBI should unbias, so what a popular or favored candidate is under investigation-so what. He should've said 'on going investigation can't say much'.

Throw in the Sandusky scandal and rioting students as late as last fall after a football game Penn State seems to be looking the other way on bad pr issues. There's obviously an alcohol problem yeh yeh I know college students drink but how many riot after football game. And one must wonder many un or under reported incidents there have been over the years.

I'd figure both the son and college would want to quietly get away from the Paterno years.

<TEXT> One would figure the son would want to quietly distance himself from his father's legacy as would Penn State.

 Instead the son has publicly defended his dad/ Joe  Paterno crying cover up and frame job. And many Penn Staters are still whiny about the sanctions being too harsh when many thought they were too lenient.

In a disgusting yet fitting twist Paterno gets his board seat the same week 18 were charged in the hazing death of a student on Penn State campus. Things have not changed at this school, the only reason this incident made a prosecutors office   news is that there was a fatality. But out of control fraternities, hazing, alcohol abuse etc apparently fell into the sights of the look the other way mindset   crowd at Penn State.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some single payer v police funding differences

For the most part police, not federal law enforcement is funded at the local level and their costs for the most part are clearly spelled out in budgets and proposals. Police Departments are free to pay their officers as they please and local governments tax for them as needed. Some towns give one a bill straight up for emergency services, it's cost is not hidden in one big tax number. Also local policing frequently share duties along with backing each other up at the county or neighboring town level. Single payer would need a federal tax increase along among other things including reallocating and locating resources.

With policing, the officer gets paid hourly for the most part, maybe some overtime or comp time along the way. The police get paid the same wether they rescue a cat or have a shoot out or chase a suspect. Doctors, health care providers want or are paid by the procedure which would be like the police charging extra for a robbery vs a noise complaint. 

Also to make single payer government enforced health care work not only would require new taxes but it would wind up allocating resources meaning one's now convenient hospital might move it's services 10 miles away. In our county the regional hospitals are already designated during off hours ie a burn patient goes here, a broken leg goes there etc. meaning one could pass a hospital on their way to the ER. Also more importantly  doctors and/or health care workers become defacto government employees meaning many will become hourly or salaried employees rather than billing by the job. Also means more clinic style medicine which might not be as bad but people want the convenience of an appointment. Wait times will go up to see the doc and get a non emergent procedure done. 

Also in many countries with single payer their population numbers, demographics, politics, culture, economics, other systems/services are different. It's not  just a matter of unplugging US health care and plugging in single payer. It would NOT be plug in and play. </TEXT>

Both the insurance and health care industries have made a living billing a third party for money. 

Insurance and/or bills throw money at the problem. Costly health care, drugs, medical supplies, facilities etc.

The larger population will stress service budgets more. Resources are finite but with more people using them their costs will increase.

 Australia is much closer to socialism than the US. Australia probably taxes more along with a more centralized government. That's exactly want very few want or will accept in the US.

There are different spending needs in the US. The US has more and older infrastructure that needs to be maintained. The US spends more on military good or bad but that allows many others countries to not spend on their military.

The problem now is with a larger immigrant population legal or not and the instant gratification culture socialism will get a much closer look than it did several years.

The key is get the younger workers into the work force as soon as possible so they have motivation to see what their job allows them to afford on their own without bureaucracy.

 There have been stories for years that the AMA, a large   powerful lobby worked to control the supply of doctors for decades. Many doctors say no, maybe today but decades of this practice could've help bring the cost issues we see today.

Insurance companies/lobbies are help shorting the supply the insurers with no cross state insurance selling.

Funding medical education and residency could help along with reducing some doctor debt which many use to justify their pricing. I don't want a hospital or school to exploit that though-tuition inflation is about as bad as anything out there. Third party money perpetuates inflation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being professional politicians doesn't help but a little smaller but repackaged Obama Care doesn't help either. 

The minute they saw a repeal wasn't going to fly they should've and probably still could work on getting sunsets and reduced funding on Obama Care. In other words work on phasing it out and/or letting it die. 

Some how for non catastrophic events especially we have to reduce big insurance's role as the preferred method of payment. That also means incentivizing lower cost health care service, not subsidized care but find ways to reduce the actual costs of physical care.

Just an example for arguments sake I'd give incentives for these urgent care clinics for services and pricing that can compete with ERs in some cases. A $300 trip to an urgent care is cheaper than a $3000 trip to the ER that wasn't needed. Some trips to the ER are poor planning and cya recommendations by another doctor. But insurance covers them. The providers know it. </TEXT>

Government programs should be for those who only really really need and cannot provide for themselves or family. If you want a government service but don't really need it you should pay. And once on or using a government program there needs to be incentives including education, training and/or penalties to get off those programs.

Insurance is a, one method of payment which actual physical care seems to lose out to-for a reason-the insurance industry and/or lobby.  All the focus is on INSURANCE an optional form of payment preferred by providers and patients alike. Finding ways to fund insurance coverage is nothing but a somebody else is paying for it game, who plays the game the best; the Democrats.

The focus needs to be on controlling costs and finding other wayS to deliver actual physical care. Instead we get insurance middle man funding bills. Single payer or a government health insurance plan should be an option, not the only form of payment. The government would be another middle man as well. </TEXT>

Big thing is when you drive just don't think about the final destination pay attention to the way the car is actually driving, check out any alarms and pay attention to the stresses the car has been through like desert heat, artic cold, tropical humidity, road conditions ,road or sea salt, sand, 15mph city traffic or 60 mph highway driving etc. Again pay attention to the way the car is driving or performing.

I guess it's like renting an apartment rather than buying a house. Ownership comes with cost along with work/commitment. Leasing is practical for many. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any third party would be in the same position or face many of the same issues facing Republicans today but a more hardline stance would've at least come up with a compromise bill that wouldn't be a cave-in. A third party would've fought for every line and word in the bill and more importantly the numbers. The Libertarians would've fought for more reductions because it is about the size of government and it's budgets. 

Why aren't the Republicans fighting for incremental reductions in budgets and programs. A 25% reduction might be easier to accept than elimination. Put a sunset on these programs even if it's specific things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Republicans" tend to get the brunt of commentary when it comes to conservative issues as do the Democrats when it comes to liberal or leftist issues.

The problem is with Republicans especially they are not "the" conservative flag bearer they were decades ago. But many posters treat them like that which is why a "Republican" politician or policy will get negative feedback. 

The Republicans "don't get it" as many Democrats "don't get it". If the professional politicians want to remain the establishment they need to start 'getting it'. Living in an echo chamber of positive commentary will do nothing to increase positive policy conservatively speaking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most drivers tend to overrate the strength/durability of their car and tires. Some studies have shown driving over a pot hole is like putting a car in a 30 mph crash.

Also I saw a picture of low profile sport tires in the story. Low profile tires are crap and highly susceptible to flats. The weight and width of the rims do not help the tire or suspensions either.

Report road damage asap. Small holes become big holes. Road debris often gets dragged on the road acting like sand paper on grass creating small damage that eventually turns into a pothole. 

Also I've found coasting, no acceleration while going over bump or hole helps if I cannot avoid it. Avoiding holes and bumps is just as dangerous because one doesn't want to create an accident. Most drivers are zombie drivers not paying attention or thinking about driving conditions or situations.

<TEXT> Where ever the city actually owns the curb   grass it's in the city's best interest to keep cars and trucks off that grassy area to prevent damage to the curb itself.

 Every time a car let alone a truck or van drive over the curb to get on or off the grass it risks pushing over or dragging down the curb with the motion and weight of the vehicle. 

Too much weight on the grass/dirt causes depressions which could hold water while it seeps down underneath the curb, street or sidewalk causing further damage undermining what's above.

Well being the week of 'the' Donald Trump hypocrisy   contradiction I guess we should ignore his comment and accusation of Obama hiding something by not releasing ALL of the logs .

And that's the point there were still redacted names under Obama's policy for various reasons so what is the big fuss worthy of a policy change?

<TEXT> If the telcoms and catv companies had put serious effort into their copper plant 20 years ago the cry for fiber would be half as loud. I've seen the same conditions sit for years on end. 

I don't see routine maintenance from many of the utilities. I've reported downed wires   cables in the past and both the power and phone company said unless it's a clear safety hazard they won't raise or replace them until service goes out and they have a customer report to account for their time. Can't sit on problems like that because things will only get worse.

https://www.thenation.com/article/atts-deregulation-campaign/

Comcast used it's weight and lobbying to push for the Comcast NBC universal merger which gave them control over content and not just the service. Comcast wound up hiring an FCC commissioner a month after.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/05/12/fcc-commissioner-approved-comcast-nbc-merger-headed-nbc.html

Verizon has been abandoning copper landline for years with some hoping for fiber deployment   replacement much sooner. I've heard stories of Verizon   others stalling or even halting copper repairs   replacement in the 1990s. Broadband forced some work but with fiber in the back of everyone's mind including the techs   engineers the number crunchers ensured that copper repairs/replacement and/or fiber deployment never got the attention it deserved   needed.

<TEXT> The capability is there but it's the equipment that has always been a cost issue with the telcos in particular. I heard fiber almost didn't get the layout it has today because many felt the provider should pay for   provide the power ie just  like they provided dial tone. Cost and not having dial tone/service in a power failure similar to a pots line was detraction for some in the early days of fiber   internet.

Coax might be as good or more susceptible to trouble but it takes a lot less equipment. Look at what a fios hook requires compared to the average catv hook up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Too many look at a utility like the baby bells and cable companies as THE provider in their area. People still use/talk about "the phone company". They look at them as THE entity or only way they get service.

Point being they get away with a lot of stuff simply because they are a utility and people including local politicians assume that utility can and should(more scary) do what ever they want.

What utilities do or don't to the local roads for example when they dig up the street for repairs or projects never repaving correctly. Every time  a road is paved/repaved the utilities get a notice to raise their manholes. Many blow off those request and create pot and sink holes. The cable and phone companies seem to feel they run wire in any fashion they want, not just anywhere but anyway they want becoming a truck hook, sign blocker or droop more than somebody's grand mother. They damage sidewalks, lawns, curbs etc with the way they park. Won't even get into to usual creating traffic nightmares.

<TEXT> What's sort of puzzling is how it fell in one piece which ment the connection points would've probably had to have been exposed to direct heat and flame. 4 corners got the precise amount of heat to cause a clean collapse? Even if one or two connection points failed wouldn't the collapse have been irregular instead of a clean break?  Keep in mind many roads, bridges, overpasses have expansion joints for changes in temperature but still. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assad was still in power in a vicious civil war. I doubt he would risk foreign intervention for 'a' chemical attack. Wether a civilian population suffers death and injury from standard or chemical weapons the results are still the same. Yes there is certain fear with chemical weapons but those who have suffered otherwise might beg to differ  

After a fact finding trip to Syria Gabbard herself said it would be tough to get both sides into negotiations. And there are no moderate rebels. Many think the rebels are aligned with Al Qaeda.

Again why would Assad risk foreign intervention.

She is right. The proof needs to shown to congress and the American people then world. </TEXT>

Also remember Bill Clinton appointed his wife to push Hillary Health-she just didn't get a job she got an assignment which would have directly affected everyone-Hillary Health would've been harsher than Obama Care.

Trump is a big time delegator. There are two primary factors when delegating. Trust and competency. Trump prioritizes loyalty above all   else then looks for competency or go-to people. Trump was able to build and manage a lot of his business with family. Now he can't do that. Competent people and a good resume is always out there.

<TEXT> I've seen these gas taxes proposed/enacted all over the country. One thing they always seem to miss or under play is the wear and tear heavier vehicles put on the road compared to most cars. It's weight that stresses the roads as much as volume. 

People think if they take a bus or get home deliveries they're avoiding the stress of driving a SUV or minivan on the road but it's those buses and trucks that put a lot of the wear on roads. These vehicles and/or services need to be taxed more, not the driver of most cars. They should pay something yes because they use the roads but do not wear them down the most. 

SUVs, Pick up Trucks and larger need to be taxed more, not a lot but more. And most delivery services using anything bigger than a car should have a small surcharge put on each delivery to account for that heavier vehicle wear and tear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several things going on here which everyone seems to be lumping into one big bowl of wax. First Russian "hacking", 'interference' and routine intelligence activities are all different things. Same for these "ties". Perfunctory, incidental, routine or social contact all different things. 

Manafort and Flynn were problems and let go. Flynn was apparently deceitful if not negligent on disclosure. Manafort was done before the election. Both because their activities were pretty clear. if not illegal  These two might be nothing more than businessmen with dealings all over the map. Ironic that some aggressive private deal making businessmen are the ones that could bring down Trump.

Also be aware that just because a talking head or politician has an opinion, repeat opinion but not evidence does not make it true. The narrative becomes what certain people say and/or their stated opinion, NOT the evidence they cite. Things literally get lost in the translation if they get translated at all.

That being said these hearings need to start going public with results and public testimony. They could be working on something really big or it could be like that 13 page intelligence report  with one page of known code, groups that might or most likely have done something.

That being said Maddow had to hype the heck out of it so if the numbers could be a reflection of the Maddow fans only. I wouldn't worry as a conservative. If her numbers are new viewers that could be an issue and another reflection of the political sediment in the country.

Should tv ratings be taken as a true indicator of current political sediment or trends? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Open primaries perpetuate the two party system because it gives little or no incentive to create a third party or run as an independent. That means no matter what the candidate and/or politician will be playing politics with the public AND their party/one of the two establishment parties.

 Sanders stood a better chance going third party but his candidacy got buried in the internal politics of one of the two establishment parties. Open primaries help legitimize the status quo by minimizing third party or independent candidates-The Dems and Reps love this stuff because perpetuates the myth that one of those two is the only way to vote-don't go third party participate in ours. It keeps the competition/alternatives at arms length.

If a state or party wants to allow outsiders to participate that's their decision. 

People still get to vote in the general election. It's not like people don't have 'a' choice. Time might be better spent making it easier to run/get on the ballot as a third party or independent. </TEXT>

The sport and workouts should be enough of a test for anyone.  I thought after what was it the Sayerville NJ team made the national spotlight this would all but become extinct, but it hasn't. EVERY YEAR there are reports of this stuff.

I also notice team officials and parents always seem to circle the wagons for the perps so that's where the real issues are. Coaches and parents perpetuating win at all costs or the ends justify the means. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Big Data ie Data collection, tracking and analysis HAS been big business   is part of the issue here, not just providers.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-06/carriers-sell-users-tracking-data-in-5-5-billion-market

Tracking software and companies have already caused some controversy because schools and testing companies wanted/want to use that same software/tech to track students through LIFE. 

https://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/education/item/15213-data-mining-students-through-common-core

 It's not just provider or tech companies is the end user/marketer that want's this as well. Over the last decade Sears and others were caught  using software from likes of  comScore to track customer activity.

http://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-sears-use-of-comscore-software-falls-short-on-privacy/

So the telecom, tech, marketing and retail lobby probably had as much to do with this passing as others.

But the providers don't seem to like upfront pricing with disclosure of fees. Big hospitals have inconsistent pricing dependent on insurance company plans which leads to disguising the true costs with things like the $100 aspirin.

<TEXT>  A foreigner should've been the one under surveillance. 

If the FISA warrant/s were requested or obtained under the premise the foreigner was the target but purposely obtained to listen to American or another person that is an illegal practice called 'reverse targeting'.

https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/nsas-backdoor-search-loophole

Inadvertent or 'incidental' collection of non specified American individuals now kicks in although wording and/or laws are loose.  Those individuals and/or  collected information is supposed to be  'minimized'.


Then there is the 'backdoor search loophole' which comes from poor or lack of 'minimization' of non specific target's information that was 'inadvertently' or 'incidentally' captured.

Just keep in mind 'reverse targeting' is an illegal practice used to skirt around a rubber stamped FISA warrant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the US insurance based health care or 'somebody else is paying for it' perpetuates inflationary pricing for insurance and service. Also in America it depends on the insurance plan one has which creates 'flexible' and/or inconsistent pricing. I know people who paid cash for an MRI or CAT scan for less than $500, with insurance $3000-5000 in many cases.

One of the reasons costs are out of control is they are not as identifiable as they should be. A reason there isn't upfront fully disclosed pricing/fees with many providers so they can bill/bilk the insurance as much as possible even if it's above their average. They also over bill for certain procedures   supplies to cover other costs. Any business has to cover cost but most business don't have insurance or a third party paying for their service. I'd rather see honest more precise pricing that pay $100 for an aspirin.

Lack of upfront disclosure and third party reimbursement help drive excessive cost in America. </TEXT>

The problem with all these plans/ideas is they don't address COSTS and actual causes of high cost. A BIG problem now is that providers billing varies by insurance company  and designed to ferret out the biggest payment rather than cover ACTUAL costs ie the $100 aspirin. Until accurate in detail billing accompanied by upfront/fully disclosed pricing   fees costs will never be properly addressed. People will simply look for ways to throw money at the problem through third party insurance companies or government/tax payers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Republicans failed to pass their version of health care because they did the same that Obama Care did. They created an INSURANCE bill, not a care bill. 

Republican messaging needs to include the COST issues of actual CARE. Insurance is just a method of payment or source of money for the health care industry. Third party money creates inflation and lays the seeds for exploitation. Ironically one way that will help but not cure cost issues are the markets. But when an entire market relies on a optional form of payment called insurance it is not a free market. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Republicans originally endorsed REPEAL, not repeal and replace. The first time I heard a Republican including repeal and replace you knew it was game over.

REPLACE was an over promise. DAY ONE was an over promise. 

But the pundits on the left were right, what are you going to replace it with. I would've repealed and offer up medicare/medicaid expansion right off the bat. Keep it simple. 

By redoing Obama Care which was nothing but a short recycle of the original it gave openings to special interests like big insurance and big pharma.

Republican messaging SUCKS. The conservative media gets it and gets their message across. One of the things they do is they deal in detail, the minutia much better than Republican politicians. 

The Republicans should have worked on reasons to repeal messaging a few months longer hammering, driving home the point and issues of premium increases, limited choice of doctors and plans/companies, mandates and costs like deductibles. Also needed to emphasize and relay the message that Obama Care was a tax AND those paying higher premiums are paying the tax or for others subsidized health care-that's another issue the Republicans failed to pursue. Obama Care was/IS subsidized health care. By subsidizing it and consumers getting a health insurance through a private sector company many FAIL to realize their plan is subsidized.   </TEXT>

To many issues/associated bills for an insurance bill to " solve " all the health CARE issues at once. The Republicans duplicated the Democrats here as well. A onetime huge piece of legislation will not solve decades of issues, problems, costs etc. They have to pick away at it piece by piece line by line. Or let Obama Care fail and then they even more proof it's not working.

Should add yes 'without standardized costs' or lack of upfront disclosure/pricing is a major ingredient to exploitation of the current big insurance based system. </TEXT>

Keep in mind the New York Times 'wire tapped' story came out January 19, 2017. One week earlier Obama signed off on making NSA more available. So by coincidence the NYT is leaked information regarding information/transcripts from surveillance that the NSA would not have shared 10 days earlier. Just by coincidence.

Jan 19 New York Times says investigation into Trump administration and foreign ties citing 'wiretapped' conversations.

His theory actually has more possibilities than people think since it's known the UK has it's own NSA type program called Karma and was caught spying on world leaders in the past at a G20 Summit.

Keep in mind many in the EU and anti Brexit in the UK wanted and still want to see Trump fail especially with a contrary stance on immigration   globalization. It's a theory with possibility but needed a little more qualification. 

All that being said when Trump said they were quoting a Fox news analyst that was chicken poop on Trump's part. He threw Napolitano under the bus.

<TEXT> Country leaders in this region of the world have realized for decades that terrorism and/or certain sects   factions of the Islamic faith is virulent, savage and brutal in which they must be dealt with in a similar fashion. It's not right but it is a motivation.

Yes their tactics are wrong, illegal etc but their motivations may not be as clear as one thinks. Saddam was an a hole but how many problems did he have with ISIS or other factions of the Islamic faith. His tactics were illegal and unethical but in some respects his motivations are more clear now than in the past. Keep in mind motivation does not make one just or right.

The true nature of the terrorist threat in that area of the world might explain some of their actions and policy although it does NOT justify them. </TEXT>

The problem with the ACA and Ryan Care is that they are insurance bills, not care bills/legislation. They both look for money to throw at a health care system with exorbitant costs. Until the COST of actual CARE issues are addressed they could impose a 100% penalty and costs still wont' be under control.

In the meantime one is still forced to chose between rent, utilities, car etc which one needs to exist on a daily basis in the here and now or a medical event that might occur in the near future. </TEXT>

Just one example of government dependency issues would be the battle over Obama Care v Ryan Care . It is one thing to help those who really really need insurance/CARE but another to try to cover those who could get some kind of care or insurance on their own. There are a lot of  issues with costs and no one answer. Because of Obama Care the health insurance industry has become dependent on government subsidized premiums which just enables their policies and pricing schemes.  The health care industry has also become dependent on third party/insurance based compensation and priced accordingly. Government subsidization has enabled the same environment that needed fixing/change to begin with.

<TEXT> As much as I am for disclosure I think federal election reporting requirements with criminal penalties should be enough at the local or federal level. If the candidate has an IRS or tax prosecution they'll be records available.

If candidates are forced to give up things like tax and health records  you don't think they'll require the same of private citizens one day. Or will the best candidate tolerate those requirements.

 People don't pay attention to news spoon fed to them now do they think many will take the time to read and analyze a tax return? Really, the physical tax return is what a decision is based on? How many people have taxes done for them or even know what capital gains or carry forwards are?

This legislation is similar to the populist nature of many candidates today. Sounds good but will the best candidates surface to the top and will it affect voter decisions?

An existing underground infrastructure could be used to get near the property. Instead of pulling a copper wire cable through the conduits they could just pull some fiber optic cables instead. 

The only street digging might be to get from a manhole to the building's phone room. And since many buildings in NYC might have as many utility cables in them as a small neighborhood there might even be a spare conduit or an old cable they could pull out.

<TEXT> Obama Care is failing because it was an insurance bill, not a care or cost bill. It found/manufactured money to throw at a problem. Third party money helps perpetuate inflation along with creating dependency on it. 

Until the actual way care is delivered and billed for not even Trump Care will work because it's focus is insurance as well.

<TEXT> The bill is exactly that 'a bill'. Is it about affordable health CARE or insurance? 

Obama Care failed because was misused/interpreted as "the" answer to affordable health care but it wound it being about insurance. Since when did 'insurance' become the only way to pay a medical bill. Controlling or subsidizing insurance companies won't control costs. Third party reimbursement creates/festers inflation-someone else is paying for it.

Access to health CARE is about COST, what is the cost of care. Focusing on INSURANCE diverts attention from the cost issues associated with health CARE. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just something to keep in mind. Republicans and/or conservatives were the first to propose an individual mandate to buy insurance back in 1989 when the American Heritage Foundation recommended everyone buy insurance. Even the Democrats weren't thrilled at first. In 1993 the idea was modified a little but went away when Hillary Health died.

http://americablog.com/2013/10/original-1989-document-heritage-foundation-created-obamacares-individual-mandate.html

They're recycling some of the same old stuff.

Also they are currently trying to sell the mandate under a false premise comparing it to auto insurance. But it's a false comparison because auto insurance only kicks in after a/one catastrophic event. They don't pay for routine maintenance and/or normal wear   tear repairs/replacements. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Insurance companies and those dealing in/with medicaid got subsidies. The people who handle and distribute the money got more money. The customer/patients, doctors, hospitals, clinics etc didn't get money to pay for actual care. The cost issues that caused affordability problems in the first were never properly addressed. The ACA focused on insurance issues, not care   costs.

The Republicans didn't vote for Obama Care. The bill was passed along partisan lines.

If a person can't afford insurance with some making so little they're exempt from Obama Care IRS fees/fines what the heck do they think a 30% penalty will do. And they'll have the same issues. So many of a poorer person resources will go to just paying premiums they won't be able to pay for actual care/services. 

CARE and COSTS are THE issues. Not how private sector insurance companies are going to get paid. That's why Obama Care is failing now-it poorly addressed CARE and COST issues. The problem is the medical care industry and insurance industry are codependent. They need each because they've both learn how to exploit each other and the customers/patients.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's the issue with government hires and appointees in general. And the higher up the position the more politics and politicians involved. A job in DC especially comes with implied if not direct favors to be paid off/given. The municipal secretary, clerk or sanitation worker etc not so much although they'll be expected to work on somebodies campaign, fill out form letters or place a signature on a petition one day. 

Even at the local level loyalty to a politician that helped one get a government job is expected to do things like work on a campaign, answer phones, deliver flyers etc. One only knows what a politician wants of someone like a police officer they helped get the job.

Point being most government positions are filled with or through political favors even though a politician might not be directly handling the situation. They trade favors like baseball cards sometimes not even knowing the details.

The multiple FISA requests and NSA sharing intelligence with other agencies is the key.

Sooner or later that shared information and ability will be used to convict people of non national security related crimes at the federal and local level. The daisy chain of political favors will eventually have a mayor or councilman call in or request a favor from a federal employee or representative one day.

<TEXT> He's looked whiter than a ghost on tv appearances over the last several years and aged showed because he over died his hair not letting any gray show. He really looked pale which could have been an indicator of his cardiovascular troubles and/or something else. 

The conspiracy might be on the public release of a cause of death or   a pre-existing condition was covered up for years. He's had several runs on tv over the last few years. I don't wether that was to revive his career or he wanted something different. Or maybe the movies weren't hiring for a reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sad, It didn't have to be. The traditional department might not have ever seen their glory days again but they didn't have to put up the white flag to the internet either.

One of the things Penneys did several years ago was to cut out the sales and go with the lower every day pricing. Problem is other stores with sales and discounters beat those prices. This was a two fold problem-pricing was still an issue and by not advertising the public starts forgetting you're there. They went back to sales and advertising and starting selling some appliances again which was good but too late. 

Hopefully the company survives in some form along with the employees. </TEXT>

I've seen less than positive articles and studies on corn syrup for years at this point.

And sugar itself doesn't do all the damage. It's things like corn syrup and other things used to supplement or substitute for sugar that can wreak as much havoc. Preservatives in drink and food don't help either. </TEXT>

It almost sounds like the local politicians are saying the soda companies should just absorb the entire tax themselves. Most will not absorb an increase like that nor they cannot afford to absorb it. So things like layoffs are not a surprise. They'll need another tax to fund the unemployed.

Then they are falling short on their desired revenue goals. Duh, people simply cannot afford spend like that, especially over time. If this tax is new and the numbers are already off what do they think they'll look like by the end of the year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The public was so mislead and over sold it's ridiculous. First it was an insurance measure, not a care measure. But now there are about 12.5 million dependent on it. And that's where funding on a solution should focus. Allow for about 15 million users. A small tax increase to fund medicare/medicaid expansion for these people might be better than premium increases, deductibles and copays many now experience.

BUT what ever is done much more will have to be done to address costs issues. COSTS not who is going to pay for it should be a core issue. One way to help lower costs is clinic style medicine, internship programs to help medical students pay off loans and find out where many of the costs go. Many complain about emergency room costs so more people be triaged and referred to a non urgent or repeat customer part of the same hospital. What's going on is simply trying to find a way to fund/throw money at a failing model.

If I was that worried about living in the US I'd be screaming where's my  fair   speedy trial or a deportation hearing with in a reasonable period of time. How come they were not protesting for an expanded   expedited deportation process ie more deportation courts, judges, personnel etc. Or for more resources to help immigrants become legal citizens or residents.

 Making matters even worse there are schools out there that tell the students they shouldn't work while they are attending and some will/do take that 'advice' to heart.

<TEXT> Favors are traded like baseball cards in US politics. Just about any government job wether an administrative appointment or civil service frequently require a politician as a written or verbal reference. Sometimes it takes a daisy chain of favors. Sort of like they multi team multi player deals in professional sports. But yes it could either start or end as an envelope. And this is how business HAS been done for decades if not centuries at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> American politics. Most appointees and many civil service employees get their position through political favors. If not a direct favor an indirect one.

 In my hometown just to work as a trash man or secretary one needed a politician as a reference on the application or "a word" would have to be put in for them. The politician usually will do it for family   friends or one will probably have done something for them in the past. Unofficially if you want a government job you are told work on a politician's campaign or in their office as a gofer. Sometimes politicians trade, accumulate or curry favors amongst themselves which in turn they call in if a neighbor wants a government job. Sometimes a favor can work it's way up from a local councilman's office all the way to a US Senator's office. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Public schools are not ment to make a profit but people make/collect money off of them. Their operating budget comes from the taxpayer.  Education in America is a business including text book, testing, supply companies along with the schools. People are making money off of education including the public school system-employees including teachers make profit every time a paycheck is cut for them, it might not be what they desire but they got paid. They are living off of a mandatory school attendance requirement-artificial market in which by default are the only solution to for many parents and individuals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I highly doubt it will be the privatization of the entire public school system. She will advocate for greater school choice and vouchers. Public education should always be AN option and there for those that simply can't get into a private school. 

The funding of private schools should and will have to be monitored /checked as should the education budgets of local public schools systems which seemed to have gotten out of control.

In a little over a decade local school taxes have more than doubled yet the academic scores and college bound or trade certified individuals have remained flat if not lower. The school system used to be in the top 3 in various rankings recently not even in the top 10. More money per student is not the answer.

 I know being an ex union member myself how any union could lead their members to think they are the only ones that can do the job. But that simply isn't true.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Washington DC camera surveillance system was hacked  weeks prior to the inauguration. Not only was that story buried or minimized in the news so was a murder and potential evidence/video that was lost because of that hack. AND, and two were actually arrested for the hack in London in which and English man and Swedish women were believed to have something to do with or perpetrated the hack.

So here we have another senseless murder in a big city, evidence of an actual hack/crime and the arrest of two individuals in regards to the hack(who also should be charged with obstruction of justice and damaging public property). And yet the hypocrites still want to cry about "the Russian hack" in which no real concrete or prosecutable proof has been publicized. 

The story of Vivian Morrow, a murder victim needs to come front a center along with the damage the ignored hack/hackers caused. At best we'll still get excuses for these so called protestors   protests. </TEXT>

It's not called down under for nothing.

The bad hombre talk is exactly that-talk. But it would not be the first time the US sent the military into a country to get criminals including Mexico. Army Expedition sent into Mexico in pursuit of Pancho Villa.

He does have natural in advantage. He's a fairly tall quick man. Longer legs equal longer strides   more distance covered per step/stride. He also doesn't over train his upper body which can be an impediment. Not having the upper body fight against you is tough.

<TEXT> The Olympics are an outdated unnecessary concept. Most cities lose out after a temporary bump in the economy. Along with facilities security and logistics could very well eat up or offset any money saved by using existing facilities. 

With greater access to the same events and athletes year round with cable   satellite tv along with internet the novelty of the events or athletes is no more. It's a show of professional athletes. Who cares, in many countries including the US the athletes, events and outcomes are meaningless.

To top it off I thought the spirit, mission or policy of the Olympics was to be apolitical yet politics are being injected into the bidding process. Throw in FIFA and doping agencies are any of these events apolitical or an altruistic endeavor.

<TEXT> Los Angeles shouldn't host the Olympics for many reasons with the least being politics.

Most cities wind up losing out on high profile extravaganza events especially in the US where millionaire sports team owners already extort, cajole and/or beg for tax payer dollars. There is a temporary bump in the local economy but there are also many local businesses that lose out on things security measures and traffic control reasons.

To top it off the Olympics are outdated quite frankly especially since the pros are allowed to compete. And high profile record breaking athletes are able to be seen all year round, not just every four years in the day and age of cable, satellite and/or internet broadcasts.

There are also many international events year round every year so the annual get together for millionaire athletes is not necessary. Throw in cheating and/or the drug scandals are we really looking at the worlds greatest athletes or a pumped up show.

But politics, which shouldn't even be in sports are the least of any cities worries.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The administration should be using documented cases or current investigations as a starting point. Not studies which should be used for supplemental material. Multiple sources in multiple states such as dead people voting in California and Colorado would be an example and just a starting point. 

But neither party wants this because if nothing else it indicts the process that got THEM elected. Fraud needs to be looked at the local level and primary elections in particular because these lower level candidates wind up in positions of influence including ones that has the power to ignore issues at the local level. 

Still not completely buying the accidentally checked the citizen box but citizenship should be verified. Arrests were made in Texas this year in which an ineligible voter knowing lied about the citizenship to vote, 5 times.

Even the msm are asking high profile individuals where was this turnout at election time. And what are you protesting.

And with companies that provide crowds along with big money/Soros one has to wonder not only was their transportation taken care of but were the numbers supplemented. I know when I was union we sent members to numerous protests and/or events. Unions have been using informational picketing for decades.

<TEXT> As necessary as hazardous gas meters should be that hole should've been ventilated with fresh air for about 15-20 minutes minimum to displace and lower the concentrations of gases. And the ventilator hose should've been kept in the hole while they were going in and working. Heck one can buy the blower and hose at places like Grainger over the counter.

The problem with air packs or any equipment tool is that theoretically the metal could rub, cause a spark and poof. Confined spaces should be ventilated prior to and doing the work. 

Yes dangerous but miners, tunnelers and other utilities such as phone and electric go into manholes everyday and one of the things they do/emphasize is fresh air. It's not just about air packs which are important but not 'the' whole solution </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's got to be all sorts of electronic testers along with manual squeeze/bladder operated, probably methane and natural gas most common. But just as important as testing is getting fresh air/ventilator hose down in the hole or confined space to displace the gases that have built up.  If it's a street manhole it's subject to run off on the street so that could petroleum products, food/grease etc. Also Florida being at sea level the moisture   soil content of a hole probably allows for different gases to build. 

They kept talking about air packs but the rescuers could've ventilated the hole with that big yellow hose bringing  fresh air in behind them. 

Also any confined space work areas require safety training. A pit might not be considered a confined since it has a large opening. Hole over 3 ft deep I think it is have to have the sides reinforced. </TEXT>

 They were cited. One was for not performing test on the air before entering.  A near by resident complained about a smell for months. They should've let that hole air out for a while along with forcing fresh air into the hole before entering. 

Air packs were not the solution. With that much gas a metal tank might banged/rubbed on something and created a spark.

First it was the Russians, then 16 agencies 'concluded'-or gave their "opinion", the it was the 13 page report with maybe one page of possible evidence, the another 33 page report short on evidence but again loaded 'conclusions' then Trump was briefed and someone asked about the Russian Hack and Trump gave a thought among many others.

<TEXT> Most regardless of profession don't like rude treatment and no matter how professional they claim to be a doctor can be affected. Most people take things personally and will "screw you" verbally and action wise. Those who tend not to let themselves get distracted and stay focused on the task/s at hand are the ones that will succeed or excel in life in general. 

ANYONE who deals with the public, customers etc has to expect 'rude' treatment. It would be nice if everyone could just get along but that is not reality. Doctors and others should know   expect it.

 I've always found the bouncer training scene in the movie Roadhouse to be most effective in real life as well in which Patrick Swayze tells them "Be nice" no matter what the patron does.
