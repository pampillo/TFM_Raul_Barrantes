<TITLE> Her Big Cousin </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> She was barely 13. A small girl in my home room class that would always come back from recess crying. Balling even. The other kids picked on her because she was new. Homeschooled her entire life so social interaction wasn't her strong suit. After a month of constant coming back from the playground crying she finally came back bleeding. It ran down her forehead and settle on her lip where she locked away from time to time. After class I confronted her asking her about what happened. 

"Oh it's nothing. My big cousin Oscar will deal with them." She said it with pride. Like she was putting together a plan against her peers. That was scary. How cold and empty yet powerful the words she said were. So I called her mom but her dad answered annoyed as all hell. He cursed and hollered at me for about ten minutes before handing the phone back to the mother. The conversation was calm and civil and ended with me asking, 

"Does Amy have a big cousin?"
"Named Oscar?" She said before I had even finished the syllable. 
"Um, yes ma'am. 'Her big cousin Oscar' she said."
"Oh that's her imaginary friend. We had a boy that passed away in a car accident years ago. She knew his name and he became her fallback for stressful situations. Saying her would tell her anyone that hurt her would 'go away'"
I was shocked. It was creepy, but before I said anything she finished the phone call with a,
"Mr. Nymera she is a strange child yes and she's had friends before and they all picked on her. Please don't encourage this cousin of hers."
She hung up and I came back on Monday to a cold stare from Amy. 
"Why'd you tell mommy? Because mom tells my father and he gets very very angry with me."
I apologized hoping to avoid any more of that cold gaze. The week went on as normal except that when I went home my neighbor told me a man was lurking around my house. The scariest shit was that she told me that he was a giant of a man. 
"He stood nearly six foot seven. Wider than a door way." 
She said that he was nearly bursting out of his jacket and jeans from muscle mass. I went back on Monday and avoided Amy entirely but she didn't avoid me. She always waited to leave the classroom until it was just me and her. Just smiling at me with benevolence which shocked me because I thought she hated me. 

I stayed late one night and saw a man in the hall way. Massive. He was in view just as quick as he was out. I tried to rationalize it being one of the janitors but the size was impossible. The biggest man who worked there was Tony. And he was only 6'3" and thin as hell. This man was bulky. Nearly busting out of his jacket. I moved to the door to peer out to see him, but he was gone. He was just passing the door and there is another 4 yards before he could turn out of sight. A loud crash sent piss shooting out of me and I fell to the ground and faced the shattered window. Inside it's frame was a man the size of a bear with his fist where the window was he unfurled his fist and dropped a piece of paper on to the ground and said in a voice so deep and gruff that it physically shook me. 

"Children must be nice."

I blacked out and woke up only 20 minutes later and got myself together and left. I got a sub for the Tuesday class but when I came back in Wednesday the chalkboard read, 

"CHILDREN MUST BEHAVE!!"

I called the sub and asked if anything happened. She said that they went out for recess and Amy didn't comeback. I ran out into the playground and found a stick through the handle in the shed. Bent from stress. I ripped the door open and no one was inside. The back of the shed was gone ripped completely open and I was shook. 

Thursday came round and Amy wasn't there. Two weeks went by and I called Amy's mom and she said that she was home now and would be back next month. 

Next month can and Amy was sat in her seat...beaten. Faded bruises and cuts all over. She told me that her father had gotten angry when she came home late last Tuesday. A full class welcomed me early Monday morning and I was happy. I stayed out late and Amy was the first to head it. 
"I'm getting ready for my cousin to visit!"
"Today?" I said holding back fear. 
"Yes!!" 
As we walked back to class Amy said she had left her lunchbox outside so I went to get it and as I walked out I saw massive footprints. 

The screaming started immediately after. I ran inside and saw the door shut tight. I pulled and pulled and it didn't budge. All I heard was a disgusting and inhuman ripping sound. I started balling and it ended. The door slid open and I looked in. The Big Cousin was looming with the lifeless corpse of a student in his hand gripped by the back of his neck. He wriggled and the man squeezed a loud crunch out of the kids neck. Amy sat facing forward a smile occupied her face. Bodies lay all over the ground. Some ripped open and others just crumpled. I threw up. 20 kids disemboweled and mangled horrifically. I blacked out and woke up to hand cuffs. I took the fall and I sit on death row now. Waiting for it to come confessing to the crimes. What the all wondered was how I killed all them so quickly and why I left Amy. I told them I felt sorry for her and left her alone. The Big Cousin of course was gone. Amy has sent me letters and they've all gone with out response. Tonight is the night that I die and I work up to a balled up note in my cell. 

"Children must behave."
