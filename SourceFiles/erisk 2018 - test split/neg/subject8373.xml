<TEXT> I currently use my old Tascam DR-60D and send the audio back into the camera via the 3.5mm like /u/I_Pee_In_The_Sh0wer 

Definitely not the most ideal set up, but the redundancy is nice and it works. Using the slate tone makes syncing the two audio tracks simple. Planning on buying the DMW-XLR1 eventually to eliminate some of the bulkiness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does anyone have a cage for their GH5? I'm trying to decide on one. 

I'd like to buy a generic cage, but I'm afraid the XLR-1 adapter won't fit with those. 

It looks like there are only a few GH5 specific cages coming out listed in [this article](http://www.4kshooters.net/2017/03/31/gh5-cages/).

The Smallrig cage looks promising. The price is low for a pre-order right now too.

Anybody have some input?

<TEXT> Thanks. I think it's a good choice to take on job when I'll need all my gear. My concern for the 450 is when I'm traveling for vacation.

I'm wondering how much of a pain it would be to remove most of the padded dividers to make room for other things like clothes and food. I only really need to take the body and another lens or two. How is the bag as far as bulkiness? I can't really tell the difference in pictures between the 450 and the 350. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Suggestions on camera backpack for gigs and travel </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-04 23:52:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been researching camera backpacks and am having a hard time finding the right one. One bag to do both would be great, but that may be asking too much. Upgrading from the Amazonbasics backpack.

Fully loaded for gigs, I'll probably be packing the following:

- GH5
- 2 medium size primes
- 1 large and 1 small zoom lens
- Tascam DR-60D (Eventually the Panasonic DMW-XLR1)
- Shotgun mic
- XLR cable
- Wireless lav system
- Small LED light
- Batteries and other small accessories

For traveling, I'm looking to fit the camera body and maybe two lenses with space to spare for clothes, snacks, etc. Quick access to the camera from the side or top of the backpack would be great. 

Here are two bags I've been looking at:

[Lowepro Protactic 450 AW](http://store.lowepro.com/protactic-450-aw)

[Incase DSLR Pro Pack](https://www.incase.com/shop/bags/incase-dslr-backpack-pro-pack-for-camera/)

For traveling only: [Pacsafe Camsafe v17](http://www.pacsafe.com/camsafe-v17-anti-theft-camerabackpack.html)

Does anyone have some experience with these bags? Any input would be great.

Edit: Sorry, read your comment wrong. So in-body stabilization only was just as good as well as in-body+optical stabilization? I read through the article and it looked like they only tested the in-body and electronic stabilization, not optical.  </TEXT>

I feel you though on not wanting to deal with the complications of using an adapter. I think I'm going to buy the 12-35 2.8 regardless of what else I buy. Seems like a great lens for almost everything. 

I love reading everybody's different reasoning for making the decisions they did. I'm pretty addicted to it actually haha  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, I may have linked the wrong article. The only thing I noticed in that one was that it says "EF-S: No under the speed booster section. But this (https://suggestionofmotion.com/blog/canon-efs-vs-apsc/) says EF-S is not compatible with the speed booster.

"For example, Metabones EF Speed Booster (used with the Panasonic GH4, Sony a7S, Sony FS7, etc.) is only compatible with the standard EF mount, not the EF-S mount. This means that Canon own crop sensor lenses are not compatible with the Speed Booster, while third-party crop sensor lenses are compatible because they use the standard EF mount."

Also here: https://m.dpreview.com/articles/5547568336/metabones-speed-booster-ultra-for-micro-four-thirds 

"The adapter will be available in Nikon F-mount and Canon EF-mount versions (meaning that Canon EF-S lenses can't be mounted, but third-party APS-C EF mount lenses can)."

So those have me thinking that my EF-S lenses won't work. That leaves me with the Canon 50mm 1.8 and Rokinon fisheye. Ive been meaning to replace the 50mm anyway, so that really only leaves me with the fisheye to use on the speed booster.

But, your point about the Sigma lens is good. It seems like a lot of people love the combo. I'm having a hard time deciding between that and going native with the Panasonic 12-35mm 2.8  and a fast prime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have a good point about that. I'm currently working full time in an office, but have recently been picking up a lot of gigs on the side. I do value using tools that simply work, and not having to fiddle with little things. 

For low light, do you think getting the fast Panasonic lenses will do? Such as these?

https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/986097-REG/panasonic_h_h020ak_lumix_20mm_f1_7_ii_asph.html

Or should I spend a bit more to get the Voigtlander 25mm f0.95 for when I catch myself in low-light situations? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have considered it. The Voigtlander 25mm f0.95 is on my list for low-light scenarios. I find myself in those situations pretty often for events. A fast zoom for those types of situations would be pretty helpful, which is why I was thinking about the 18-35 f1.8 Sigma + Speedbooster. But, after reading, it looks like it's pretty heavy and you'll need it on a rig or a tripod to get usable video. Maybe that's not the case though. 

Right now, I think I may be leaning towards buying the Panasonic 12-35 ii for now. 

What "quirks" are there with the speedbooster? Things like AF not working or what?

<TEXT> Autofocus isn't extremely important. I mainly use manual focus while filming. 

So you're saying the Sigma 18-35 1.8 with a speed booster? I know that lens is made for APS-C size sensors. I've also read that Canon EF-S (APS-C) aren't compatible with the speedbooster [here](https://suggestionofmotion.com/blog/panasonic-gh4-lens-options-canon-ef/).

Canon 18-200mm 3.5-5.6

<TITLE> Help me pick lenses for a GH5 ($3k budget) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-25 00:31:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just preordered the GH5 and now I'm looking at lenses. I'm coming from a Canon 60D and I have basically all APS-C lenses, so I'm planning on building a whole new kit.

I'm using the GH5 mainly for video. Going to be using it for promotional, corporate, event, documentary and action sports.

Budget: $3000

I can't decide if I want to get native lenses or Metabones Ultra and Canon mounted glass.
One lens I know I want is the Panasonic 12-35 f2.8 II. Was thinking about getting the earlier version, but I really want to take advantage of the Dual IS the GH5 offers.

If I went native, I was thinking of buying the Panasonic 12-35 f2.8 II, 35-100 f2.8 I or II (Don't know if I'll need Dual IS since I probably wont' use this lens handheld much), and the Voigtlander 25mm f0.95.

If I go with the Speedbooster, what lenses should I get that will cover a good amount of focal lengths? I want to invest in good, fast glass, so I know this route limits me to only 1 or 2 lenses considering my budget. I figured the extra stop of light from the speedbooster will help me out with the event gigs, so that's making me really consider going this route.

What should I do? </TEXT>

Edit: I've partially decided. For now, I'm picking up a used Panasonic 12-35mm f/2.8 I. I read that for video, Dual IS I isn't much different than Dual IS II. I'm going to try out some Canon FD lenses, specifically the 50mm f/1.4 S.S.C. and the 28mm f/2.8 S.C. I'm holding onto my money for bit before I invest in a prime like the Voigtlander 25mm f/0.95 and a longer range zoom. I want to play around with these lenses and learn the camera before spend a lot more. I may put that money instead towards a rig, the DMW-XLR1 or maybe even the Zhiyun Crane. I'm not sure yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does anyone have some info on the slow start up/login screen on the Dell Chromebook 13? I've tried it in the Stable and the Dev channel since I heard it was fixed. Is it a problem with my chromebook (bought last week) or is it a known bug? I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to fix it or just wait for an update.

**Stable Channel**

Profile pic and password window takes about 20-60 seconds to show up on start up. 

**Dev Channel**

Profile pic and password window show up immediately. Sometimes it won't let me type my password in for awhile, or I'll type in my password and then it kinda freezes for about 10-20 seconds.

I'd like to get a super sharp and fast do-it-all type lens for my kit when I pick up the GH5.

<TEXT> Most companies have a lens tint guide that tell you what lens to use in different light conditions. The exact name of the lens tint you have should be in the description for the goggles you just bought. 

The second lens will usually be for low light conditions. For example, I just bought a pair of Electric eg2.5s that came with a black lens for sunny days, and then my extra lens is a light green lens for snowy, darker days. 

No tips on dealing with scratches. In fact, I just got one on the side of my new lens and I was pretty bummed. It happens. If it's not huge and not too noticeable, I wouldn't worry about it too much. If it does bother you, you can usually purchase a replacement lens for pretty cheap.  </TEXT>

I haven't gotten to use a Samsung Plus, so I can't compare to see if I think it's worth spending more for it. The square aspect ratio on the Plus does seem a little bit odd. I liked the ratio on the Acer 14. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Went to Best Buy last night and they had an Acer 14 on display so I played around with it. It seemed to handle a few tabs perfectly fine. But once I loaded up a long article and started scrolling through, I could tell it was struggling a bit. I couldn't tell if it was the Chromebook or the internet though. 

As far as build quality goes, I thought it was perfectly fine. The screen was big, the chromebook was thin, and it felt pretty solid. The Acer 14 might be my backup choice to the Dell CB 13 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

I've been doing a lot of research on chromebooks lately and I can't figure out what to do. Basically what I'm looking for is a quick machine that looks nice and will allow me to shop online, have tons of tabs open, and stream videos without hesitation. As a chromebook newbie, would this put me in the higher end of chromebooks?

**Budget**

 $500 USD

**Uses**

General web browsing (Amazon, Facebook, Reddit, etc.), Video streaming at home and watching movies while traveling

**What I'm looking for**

Aluminum body and high build quality, 12+ inch screen hdmi port, performance. 

**What I don't care for**

Touchscreen, tablet mode, usb-c

**Questions**

Would an Acer Chromebook 14 fit my needs? Or should I be looking at the Samsung Chromebook Plus? 

What are the benefits of having a touchscreen and tablet mode? I can't really see myself taking advantage of that.

What are the benefits of having Android apps? Will most newer Chromebooks eventually support them?

<TEXT> I think $600 was what he asked for it. I'm gonna double check with him right now. Maybe it was $900.

The C100 is a solid camera from what I've read. However, I think I'd rather get the features of the hybrids for that price. The portability and ability to take photos is somewhat important to me when I travel. I can't decide! haha I think either route will serve me well. I just can't decide on which to go with. 

I'm not sure if you saw my note, but my cousin can get me 25% off on the Sony. So it would be closer to $2250. The GH4 is still much cheaper, however. That $1k difference could be put towards lenses, accessories, gimbal, etc. Hmm...

Edit: Friend replied saying $650 for the light kit. </TEXT>

Should I take my friend up on his offer for his Lowell kit?

I'm not really sure where I stand on the hybrid vs. dedicated camera. On one hand, having built-in XLRs, NDs, and better ergonomics would be really nice on a dedicated camera. I think I'd be looking at maybe a C100s. On the other, hybrids offer a lot for a cheaper price. 

I'm not looking to buy a camera immediately. I can definitely wait. A GH4 could be a good option when the 5 drops. As a GH4 user, do you have any opinions on the GH4 vs. a7sii?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After filming for 3+ years on my Canon 60D, I think I'm about ready to upgrade. I'm not sure what route to take, however. I shoot a variety of things: mainly corporate, action sports, and documentary. I'm looking to get more into narrative and travel logs and will soon be shooting some music videos with a friend's band. A lot of this would be for personal projects and some low-key paid shoots. I figure if I ever land a big gig, (which I'm not planning on any time soon) this camera could serve as a b-cam and I'd rent an a-cam. In short, I'd like a camera that can handle almost anything. Being able to take photos would be nice, but not absolutely necessary. Also something to keep in mind is that I have a cousin that works at Sony and would be able to get me 25% off any camera gear.

Sorry, I know this kind of question has been debated a million times here. If someone could link me to a similar thread, I'd really appreciate it!

**Budget**

Willing to spend up to $5K USD

**My gear**

Canon 60D

Canon 50mm 1.8f

Canon 24mm 2.8f

Canon 18-200mm 3.5-5.6f

Rokinon 8mm 3.5f (For skateboarding)

Tascam DR-60D

Rode NTG-2

Benro S7

A lot of the lenses I have are APS-C only, so I'm looking at buying new lenses as well.

**My questions**

Hybrid or dedicated video camera?

If I go dedicated video camera, which should I look at?

If I go hybrid, Sony a7sii or Panasonic GH4/5?

Should I consider an external recorder?

Should I go cheaper and get lights? I've got a friend that said he would sell me his Lowel kit for $600.

<TEXT> A few months ago, my iPhone 6's battery level would jump all over the place and die even when at 60%+ charge. I took it into Apple, they told me my battery was at it's end, so I replaced it myself. 

After that, the battery drains normally again, no more skipping around. However, it would still die at about 40%. Then, I wiped my phone and restored iOS and then backed up my phone, but it will still die randomly.

<TEXT> * **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
$350 USA (will spend a little more if it's worth the price increase) 

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Good battery life, thin, and small SSD (128gb or smaller), no HDD. HDMI port

* **How important is weight to you?**
 Weight is of medium importance. I'll mainly be using it at home, but it would be nice to take it places sometimes. 

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 Windows or ChromeOS/Linux

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 N/A

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
 No video editing, I have a dedicated desktop for that. I just need something to shop online, check emails, watch movies (local files), watch YouTube, things like that. I do very light photo editing from time to time. 

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 N/A

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 If possible, good, thin build quality would be nice. I don't need touch screen or fingerprint read or anything fancy like that. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 I'm looking for light, thin, and snappy laptop that will be good for light usage. I have a dedicated video editing/gaming desktop at home, and I use my laptop for small stuff, like watching videos and shopping online. 
It seems like a Chromebook would suit my needs, but, I do watch a lot of movies on my laptop from local files (non-streaming). I don't believe I would be able to do that with the ChromeOS. I've read a bit about installing Linux on Chromebooks, but I'm not 100% sure what Linux would allow me to do exactly, since I've never used it.

Does anyone have advice on what I should be looking for? Any advice and/or recommendations are appreciated! </TEXT>

I recently started shooting film for fun, and this Christmas, my cousin told me he had something for me, and brought out this big box that my grandfather had passed down to him in the 70s sometime. The cameras are almost in perfect condition, it's unbelievable. My mom always told me my grandfather was a bit of a perfectionist, and I guess this proves it. Apparently he took great care of all his possessions.

According to this site: http://global.canon/en/c-museum/series_search.html?t=camera s=film y2=1960 sort=old
It looks like the first camera is possibly a Canon IV or III. I can't really tell the difference. The second camera looks like some variation of the Canon II. I'm not sure about that one either.

If anyone has some info on these cameras or could point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it! Would there be a better subreddit for this post? (I posted to r/cameras already) I may try posting on r/vintagecameras, but that sub doesn't seem too active. </TEXT>

(Don't judge the saddle position. I had just gotten the bike when I took this pic!)

I recently fixed up my dad's old 1991 Bianchi Virata, and have decided to part ways with my 1984 Centurion Comp TA. How much should I list it for on Craigslist and Facebook? I live in Southern California, and also right next to a college town.

The bike is 50cm, and in very good condition. Full Shimano 600 SIS groupset. The tires are Continental Ultra Sport ii's, with under 100 miles on the tires. The bike is very clean, and rides great. 

I've seen some people saying that Comp TA's in good condition are worth anywhere from $200-300. Not sure how much to ask for mine.

Please let me know! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been doing a bit of research on laptops for my girlfriend. She'll be using it for general browsing, video streaming, and graphic design (Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop).

I finally decided on this one: http://www.costco.com/HP-ENVY-x360-13-y013cl-13t-Touchscreen-2-in-1-Laptop---Intel-Core-i7---QHD%2b-.product.100317294.html

Right now, it is $200 USD off at Costco, making it $1000.

-  i7-7500U 2.7 GHz
- 256 GB m.2 SSD
- 16 GB RAM
It also has a touch screen and the ability to be used almost like a tablet, which are features that she really wants, as well as thinness/portability. 

Is this a good deal? I haven't been able to find another laptop with this high of specs that is this cheap. She also really cares about how it looks. Are there any other laptops that would be a better choice?

Max budget is $1000 USD. </TEXT>

Seller description: 22 1/2 inch Cannondale for sale with padded seat and back bike rack. 15 Speed. Chips in paint on frame but great bike and good tires! Light aluminum frame.

I think the bike is smaller than what they have written. I've been emailing them a little, and the owner is 5'7", and said that it doesn't feel too big. Keep in mind that I'm 5'6", but I'm not exactly sure what the perfect size would be for me on a vintage touring bike. I currently have a 50cm 1984 Centurion Comp TA and I'm very comfortable on it. Should a vintage touring bike be the same size? Larger? Smaller? 

How good of quality is this bike? Seller is asking for $150.  

I'm looking at vintage touring bikes to go on a 6-7 day ride from San Francisco to Santa Barbara and was wondering if I'll need to upgrade this bike a lot or if can handle the job as is. 

Some people on bikeforums.net were saying that a modern 700c wheel will fit with almost no problem. If I were to upgrade the wheels and use an 8 speed cassette, would I need to change the derailleurs or anything else? I'm not too experienced in switching parts out on these older bikes.

Any opinion on the bike is appreciated! </TEXT>

I paid $700 for the engine (including core and shipping from about 75 miles away)

<TEXT> Found out my 2.3 with 112K miles had a cracked cylinder head a month ago. I did a ton of research over at mazda3forums.com and found out it's relatively easy to swap in a 2.5L from a Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan, or Ford Escape. (Years vary) 

The used Ford engines can be found much cheaper online. I found one with 32K miles, for only $500. Whereas  used Mazda 2.3 engines with about 100K miles on them were about $1000-1200. 

I had my mechanic swap it for me, since I live in an apartment, and don't have the tools, skill, or time required for this job.

My mechanic ran into only one problem: the intake manifold adapter plate I bought from 2008Milan over at mazda3forums.com was a tiny bit too long and blocked the actuator from opening the intake flaps. 2008Milan was extremely helpful and sent me a new actuator from a local junkyard since mine had broke from the plate obstructing it. 

After that, the engine ran perfectly fine. I can tell it has a little bit more power. I'd have to get it tuned to take advantage of all of it, however. I'm not planning on doing that soon. I just got it back yesterday and it was so much fun to drive after occasionally borrowing my girlfriend's 2016 Toyota Corolla. 

Fingers crossed for no future problems! I'm really excited to see how my gas mileage is affected.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Swapping Ford Fusion/Escape 2.5L into 08 mazda 3 2.3L </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-18 03:20:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Unfortunately, my 08 3 with 112K miles has either a cracked head or blown head gasket. I've been doing tons of research, and after weighing my options, I've decided to pursue swapping a 2.5L Ford Fusion/Escape engine into my car for the following reasons (in order of importance):

* More reliable
* Confidence that the problem won't come back on my 2.3L
* Cheaper engine cost with far less mileage. Only about $500-800 with shipping for engines with anywhere from 40-70K miles.
* More power

I plan on keeping my 08 3 for the next 5-6 years, and after reading on a lot of forums, I'm not very confident that my current 2.3L will last that long, even if the head is replaced/gasket is fixed. (My local mechanic hasn't pulled my engine apart yet since we may just replace the engine.)

Here are my options:

* Replace the cracked head (using a used $200-300 cylinder head) or broken head gasket
     * Cheaper ($1300-$1500 with parts and labor)
     * No guarantee that the problem won't come back
* Buy used 2.3L
     * More expensive than all other options (Around $1100 for motor alone with about 100K miles + about $1000 for labor)
     * Fear that "new" 2.3L will die
* Swap Ford 2.5L in
     * Reasons listed above
     * $1600-2000
     * Possible compatibility issues

As I see it, I'm willing to pay the extra money to have a more reliable engine in my car since I want to keep it for awhile. However, I do have some questions, especially for people that have swapped the Ford 2.5L into their cars.

* How reliable is the 2.5L?
* Did you have any problems with smog? (I'm in California)
* What years from the Fusion/Escape motors can be swapped in? From the guides I've been reading online, it seems like anywhere from 2009-2012 are okay. 
* Is it worth it in my case to swap out the engine? 
* My 3 is AT, does the motor I buy have to be AT as well? 
* Do I have to buy the intake and throttle body adapter?

If anybody has advice, I'd really appreciate it.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone,

Just confirmed some bad news that I suspected for awhile. My 2008 Mazda 3 has either a cracked head or blown head gasket. :( A mechanic that I trust told me he thinks it's probably a cracked head since the coolant is leaking into the oil so slowly. 

So now I have the option of having them take the engine apart, checking for a bad head gasket or sending the head to a machine shop to check for cracks. Or I can buy a used engine and feel more confident that the problem will be gone. 

Does anybody have a first gen 2.3L they are parting out? I'm located in Santa Barbara, CA. Anywhere in California would be ideal. 

Would anybody have tips on finding a used engine? Is eBay trustworthy? Or should I exclusively look at junkyards and used part shops around here? 

Thanks in advance. 

Edit: Forgot to mention I have an AT </TEXT>

<TEXT> Car: 2008 Mazda 3 S 2.3L 

I've been getting this CEL for a few months now and clearing it with my code reader, hoping it would just go away, (I know, I've been lazy) but it keeps popping up whenever I accelerate hard when the engine is still cold. Usually happens when getting on the freeway and the engine hasn't warmed up all the way. I also noticed that my MPG have gone done a bit with city driving. My heater still works perfectly fine. My temperature gauge always sits right in the middle, and it takes about 5 minutes of driving to get it there. That seems pretty normal, right? If my thermostat was stuck open or taking too long to open, would the temperature needle reflect that at all? I'm thinking that it's taking longer than the ECU likes to warm up. 

I replaced the thermostat and the coolant temperature sensor in December of last year with parts from O'Reillys. After reading on some forums, I now know that I should have went with OEM for the thermostat. 

Does this code usually mean I'm due for a new OEM thermostat? Anybody else have some experience with this code?  </TEXT>

My dad has a an old Bianchi Virata that has been sitting in storage for about 20 years. He said I can have it since he has no use for it. My mom told me that my dad only rode it a few times and never rode it again. Haha I asked and he confirmed. 

As you can see from the pictures, it's really dirty, but I'm assuming it's in good shape since it's been in storage. He said there's no rust. I haven't gotten to check it out in person yet since I live far away. I was planning on picking it up next time I go home. He doesn't know exactly what the frame size is, but he's about the same size as me. Hopefully he bought the correct size for himself! 

Does anybody have any knowledge on the bike? Is it worth the time and effort to fix it up? 
I recently bought a 1984 Centurion Comp TA, seen here: https://i.imgur.com/jmXdu0t.jpg
I'm wondering which would be better to keep? Unfortunately, I only have room for one bike. :(

<TITLE> Need advice on choosing a 2 bike hitch rack </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-27 00:16:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi,

I'm looking for a 2 bike 1 1/4 inch hitch platform rack to put on my 2008 Mazda 3. I'm looking to spend around $200 USD. I'll be carrying two older road bikes, between 20-30 lbs each. I don't bike all the time, so I'll be putting it on and removing it every time I use it, which will probably be maybe once a week or less. 

Here are a few racks I'm considering:

Swagman XTC 2
https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-...an/S64670.html

Swagman Chinook
https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-...an/S64683.html

Saris Freedom 2
https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-...s/SA4412B.html

Does anyone have recommendations and/or experience with these racks? I'm leaning towards the Chinook right now since it has the tilting function and comes with the locking hitch pin. (Something I was going to buy anyways if I bought the XTC 2) 

Also, how much does the weight of the rack come into play? I see that the Saris Freedom 2 only weighs about 20 pounds where as the Swagmans I believe are in the 30s. The chinook might possibly be in the 40s actually. I figure weight only really affects how easy it is to install and remove the rack. 10-20 pounds probably won't affect MPG too much.

<TEXT> Hi,

I'm fairly new to biking, and I seem to be having problems with my Comp TAs friction shifter. The cable seems really tight when attempting to shift to lower gears. I loosened the cable a bit, to the point where the cable was sagging in 6th gear. I shifted all the way to 2nd gear and the lever automatically springs back up and goes back to 6th gear. What could be causing this? 

I'm not a bike expert and this is really frustrating me. I want to learn how to maintain my new bike, but this all seems so alien to me and watching videos and reading doesn't seem to help. 

Somebody please help me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The bike actually ended up being 50cm, which is the perfect size for me. No need to sell! I bought some new tires for it. It's been great so far! There are some little things wrong, like the brakes need to be adjusted and it doesn't seem like the bike wants to stay in 1st-4th gears. It seems like the cables are too tight or something and pulls the lever back to 5th or 6th gear. 

I was recently talking to my dad and he said he has a really nice road bike from the 80s/90s that he only rode a few times he said he would give me. It's been sitting in storage since then, and since he and I are the same size, I'm hoping the bike fits. He thinks it's an old Italian bike, maybe a Bianchi? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, just saw this. I've ridden it about 4 times, a 10 mile round trip ride was the longest. I'm fairly new to biking, especially vintage road bikes, but I really like it! It's a lot lighter than other older steel frames I've looked at and it's fast. I put some new tires on it and I need to fix a problem going on with the lever that controls the rear derailer. For some reason, it seems like the bike wants to stay in 5th or 6th gear. When I shift all the way down, I have to hold the lever or it'll try and switch to 5th or 6th. 
I found a perfect condition Centurion Accordo for my gf, so we've been riding around town and it's been really fun.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice on first lighting kit </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-09 21:16:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking to own my first lighting kit for mostly documentary work and some commercial. As of right now, I don't do much feature work, but I'd like to buy something versatile just in case I do any other types of films.

Budget: $300-400 USD

Biggest question: Tungsten or LED?

I found a used kit on Craigslist for 3 Lowel Totas, stands, case, umbrellas, extra globes, and power cords for $350. (They said they're open to negotiation)

I could go that route, or I could buy a new LED kit. I've done some research, and it seems like my biggest problem with tungsten is high heat, which might not be ideal for interviews. Whereas with cheap LEDs, they might not produce accurate colors.

Is there an obvious answer here that I'm not seeing? I don't have much experience with tungsten lights, none with Totas actually. I'm used to using LEDs and Kino Flos. Does anyone have recommendations on kits in my price range? Or pros and cons of each type of light in the type of work I'll be doing?

Thanks in advance!

Also, please let me know if there's a more appropriate subreddit to post this to. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I found a kit on Craigslist for 3 used Lowell Totas, with stands and a bag. 
I just recently decided to invest in my own lighting kit and I'm a little overwhelmed. 

I mainly do documentary and commercial work, and a solid lighting kit for interviews is crucial for me. I have worked with other lights on other projects, but I figured owning lights might be a different ballgame than using/renting other people's gear. Do you have any recommendations for a kit between $300-500 USD? Also, should I be looking for fluorescent, tungsten, or led? 

Does anyone have experience with the Totas? From what I've read, I heard they put out a lot of light and heat. Haven't read anything about their durability, however. 

Please let me know if I should be posting this on a more appropriate subreddit.  </TEXT>

I tried for about an hour yesterday installing different drivers and I could not get these to work together. :(

I tried installing Targus's software (http://targus.com/form/download.aspx?region=7 sku=ACB10US1), but that didn't work.  I also installed the WIDCOMM bluetooth software from Broadcom's website found here: https://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth

Is there a certain order I should be installing things? 
When I go to Devices and Printers  Add a Device, the headset popped up the first time I tried to pair it, but I still couldn't get it to work. Now, the headset doesn't pop up at all even after removing the device.

<TITLE> Restored my 08 3's headlights this weekend </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-23 02:54:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://imgur.com/a/XudGW

After being inspired by /u/kvior1 and /u/TeKiwiBird, I decided to try ChrisFix's method for restoring headlights. I spent about $20-25 USD on the supplies and about 1.5 hours total sanding and spraying both my headlights. 

As you can see in the pictures, my passenger side headlight wasn't looking too great but it looked much better afterwards! However, my headlights still aren't crystal clear. I believe this was either an issue of me not applying the clear coat correctly or not sanding enough after the clear coat had dried.  (I only sanded until the headlight was smooth and stopped because I was afraid of going overboard.) 

In the end, I'm still very satisfied with how they turned out and will do a better job next time! I'm curious to see how long they will last before yellowing/oxidizing again. </TEXT>

My 08 3 with 105K miles did the same thing (AT light and limp mode). I did a ton of research and figured it was probably the TCM. Somebody on this subreddit mentioned they got theirs replaced under the PZEV warranty so I took it in to the dealer and they diagnosed the TCM as the problem. Luckily, they had one in stock so it was fixed in the same day. That fixed the problem immediately. Hopefully they have one in stock for you! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I have a 2008 Mazda 3 S GT and I just got the code P0128 (low engine coolant temp) on my way home from work.  After reading online, many people said it is a stuck open thermostat.  However, I just replaced my thermostat two months ago with a part from O'Reillys.  

I also did did a test tonight to see how quickly my coolant temperature rose.  Starting with a cold engine, the gauge went up to the middle within 3 minutes, and my sensor app showed that my coolant temp hit 100C in about 6 minutes.  This seems fairly normal to me.  I cleared the code since then and am going to wait and see if the code returns.  

What could the problem be?  Stuck open thermostat like everyone says?  Has anybody else ran into this problem?  

Any comments/help is appreciated!

Edit: Also changed the coolant temperature sensor two months ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just put some Michelin Primacy MXM4s on my 08 in December. I also live in Southern CA.  Not sure if they're on sale still, but I got them for about $100 a tire. I was leaning towards the Conti DWS like everyone recommends, but decided on the MXM4s because they're cheaper and still have good performance.  

With that being said, the ride is a lot smoother and quieter than the Toyo Proxes 4s that were on my car previously.  Grip is great and gave me tons of confidence driving in the rain. Haven't driven them in any snow yet. 

Like the other comments mentioned, do a ton of research on tire rack and see if any reliable shops around your area will pricematch them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Awesome! Thank you so much.  I found a guy parting out his 08 Mazda 3 and said he would sell the TCM for $100. He won't be home until tomorrow though and he's not 100% sure if he has it still. Would it be worth it to give it a try? (If he still has it) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just checked it. P isn't lit up when it starts up, or it in drive, D wasn't lit up and no gear is showing. How probable is it that my TCM is dead and it's not just wiring? I checked the harness yesterday and it looked fine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't notice if it was displaying those or not. I'll check tomorrow morning, but I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't showing up.   I haven't driven it at all since that happened. I was to afraid of causing more damage. 

Thanks for the advice. Good to know if I do end up replacing the TCM. (Which seems likely) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a separate code reader for the transmission? I had no idea. Who would have these? Transmission shops and the dealer? Unfortunately, I'm only in town for this weekend so the dealer is my only choice, and that's if the service department is even open for the holidays.  
Would an auto parts store like autozone/Napa/oreilly's have a trans code reader? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started my 08 Mazda 3 S GT a couple hours after my four hour drive home for the holidays and these three lights came on: AT, check engine, and traction control. My car was driving perfectly fine before this. When I shift from park to reverse, my car jerks back and forth pretty badly. I checked my transmission fluid, and everything seems fine. Level is okay and is only slightly brown, doesn't smell burnt.
I plugged in a code reader, and it's giving me U0101 Error Communication TCM. Does this mean I'm due for a new TCM?
Has anyone else experienced this problem and replaced it yourself? If so, what guide did you use? I've been looking all over and I can't seem to find any. Any help is appreciated </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thermostat was just replaced last weekend. It didn't fix my overheating problem, and the mechanic that checked out my car said it was functioning when he was trying to diagnose it.

I'm hoping it's just an air bubble from when I replaced the coolant temperature sensor. But we'll see.  I'll update tonight when I try and burp it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I just fixed an overheating problem on my 2008 Mazda 3 by replacing my coolant temperature sensor.  Before that, I also replaced my thermostat and a cracked coolant reservoir.  Now that the overheating problem is gone, my heater only blows cold. Would could possibly cause this?  

I did notice that the top left little reservoir hose on my coolant reservoir tank is dripping a tiny bit.  Would this affect my heater? I thought the little hoses are just for overflow. 

Also, when I turn the fans all the way up and at a cold temperature, it blows out hard.  Once I turn the temperature up, the air gets a lot weaker.  And not any warmer. 

I'm going to try burping the system tonight after work and I'll post an update.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you have any tips? I'm planning on following these instructions:

A. Start the engine and idle it until the water temp indicator is in the center when the engine is below 1500rpm.
B. Bleed the air from the cooling system by using the procedures below. At this time, monitor the coolant temp to prevent overheating.
 Run the engine at 2500rpm for 2-3 minutes, 2 times. 
 Run the engine at 3000rpm for 5 seconds, then idle.
 Repeat steps above twice.
C. Stop engine and inspect coolant level after the coolant cools down.

I'll post an update tonight! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had this same problem.  In the morning or after my 08 MZ3 S GT had been sitting for a long time (5+ hours), it would stall out and almost die right after starting up unless I gave it a little gas.  It would idle really rough, with the rpms jumping between 1.5k and 500. After giving it a little gas, it would sit at around 2k rpms and be fine.  How long does it idle really rough before it runs smoothly? The problem turned out to be my coolant temperature sensor.  I bought the part at O'reilly's for about $28band replaced it myself. All you need is a 19mm deep socket and about 10-20 minutes.  Look up the symptoms of a bad coolant temp sensor, it sounds pretty similar to what you described.  PM me you have any questions!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My left rear wheel is obviously more negatively cambered than my right rear wheel.  After getting an alignment and learning that the rear isn't adjustable, they recommended either installing camber control arms or taking it to a body shop to see if anything is bent.  

Does one wheel being off necessarily mean something is bent?  The car has never been in any accidents, struts were replaced about 10k miles ago.

<TEXT> I'm buying new tires for my 2008 Mazda 3 S GT. I know the Continental DWS are one of the most recommended tires, but I got a really good deal on the Michelin MXM4's. ($85 a tire, $605 out the door with alignment plus a $70 rebate = $533.) 

Does anyone have experience with the MXM4's?  How do you like them? How are they wearing?

My car was at normal operating temp by the time I got one, but as I accelerated to get up to 65-70 mph, it started to overheat.  My gauge went from about halfway to around 3/4.  I left off the gas, and it stopped climbing.  I hit the gas a little bit again, and it started to climb so I let off.  Then it started to fall back to the normal operating temperature.

It's just when I accelerate/slow down repeatedly the temp will climb all the way up and then slowly come back down.

<TITLE> 2008 Mazda 3 - Overheating in stop and go traffic </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-02 20:35:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I'm in stop and go traffic, my car's temp gauge will randomly spike and either slowly come back down or stay up at the top for about a minute. 

I've bled out the bubbles in the coolant multiple times and the overheating keeps happening. So I don't think it could be that unless I'm doing it wrong. 

I'm thinking it could either be my thermostat, water pump, or radiator fan.  Can anyone please help me narrow it down?  Thanks!

Forgot to mention: Car has about 104k miles, AC is not on, thermostat was replaced at about 61k miles. 

**Update:** Driving home from work today I watched my temp gauge very carefully.  My car was at normal operating temp by the time I got one, but as I accelerated to get up to 65-70 mph, it started to overheat.  My gauge went from about halfway to around 3/4.  I left off the gas, and it stopped climbing.  I hit the gas a little bit again, and it started to climb so I let off.  Then it started to fall back to the normal operating temperature.  Keep in mind that this all happened in a span of about 20 seconds.  I didn't hit any traffic, so I wasn't stopped at all.  

**Update 2:** Turns out there's a small crack in the bottom part of the overflow section on my reservoir tank.  Pretty sure that's the problem.

**Update 3:** Replaced coolant reservoir and thermostat and that didn't fix it.  Gonna take it to a shop to diagnose. 

**Update 4:** I FIXED IT!  Took it to a shop and they couldn't figure out what was wrong after spending all day on it. I replaced the coolant temperature sensor yesterday and the gauge didn't show any overheating during a 30 minute test drive trying to recreate the problem and on my way to work this morning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

My girlfriend just got a new job as a marketing coordinator for a local hotel chain.  I was thinking about getting her a laptop/chromebook for Christmas since she'll be travelling around to different hotels and working from there.  

She'll mainly be working with social media websites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), sending email blasts and writing columns for their website.  As for as I know, she won't be doing any kind of graphic design or other cpu/gpu intensive work.

I'm looking to spend around $150-200 USD.   I was thinking that a chromebook with a 16gb SSD would probably be enough for her.  Which would you recommend? Are there any good black Friday deals on chromebooks?  Please let me know! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I'm putting together my first build for video editing and I've bought almost all the components except the monitor.  I've been planning on buying the Asus pb278q from Tigerdirect.  With the 20% cash back through Bank of America and a $10 promo discount, the monitor would come out to about $384 in the end.  The next lowest price I could find was on Amazon for $400 (before tax).  

Are there any other better/cheaper/newer monitors I should take a look at?  Or is the Asus pb278q a solid choice at this price? 

Please let me know!  

Edit: Pulled the trigger and ordered an ASUS PA248Q and an ASUS PB238Q through Amazon Warehouse deals.  I ended up spending about the same amount I would have for one ASUS PB278Q.  I figured I'd use the PA for my preview and the PB for my timeline/sliders/etc.  If there are no differences between the PA and the PB, I might return the PA and get another PB to save myself $90. I'll try to update when they come in! </TEXT>

Oh wow, I didn't know that about the Seagate 3TB drives.  Thanks for the advice.

Sadly, I'm not very close to a Microcenter.  The closest one is about 3 hours away.  I will definitely hunt for discounts and sales on the CPU and MOBO though.  

I'll definitely buy the cheaper ram if I'm not going to need to spend the extra money on it.   </TEXT>

I think I'm leaning more towards the 4790K and using the saved money to buy 16gb more of RAM.  However, everyone on /r/buildapc recommended buying the 5820K.  

Unfortunately, I ordered the EVGA SSC GTX970 this morning for $285 (with tax and shipping), so it's too late for the AMD R9 390.  

The Fractal Design R5 is a mid tower? Will that be a problem compared to a full size tower? (Sorry for dumb questions, this is my first build!)

That's a good idea for the SSD's.  I was just thinking about using the 120GB for the OS and apps and then the 500gb as a scratch disk.  But in this case I guess I could use two of the 256gb SSDs as scratch disks?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone, I'm torn between these two CPUs for editing.  I've been reading tons of articles and looking at benchmarks, but I still can't make up my mind.  I'll be purchasing parts later today!

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I'll be editing video using Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Davinci Resolve.  I'll also be editing photos sometimes using Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.  

Light gaming will be done, since I plan on buying Battlefront when it comes out.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Preferably under $2000.  I'm willing to spend $2100-2200 if the 5820K is really worth it.  

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States.

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please).** 

4790K Build: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/hpYx3C

5820K Build: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/m79MkL


**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Is the price difference in the 5820K justified?  I'm having a really hard time deciding between the two CPUs.  I'd really prefer to spend less and go with the 4790K build and maybe buy 32gb of ram instead.  But if the added cores on the 5820K will make a big difference in video editing, I'm willing to spend the $200 more.  

Please let me know what you think!  </TEXT>

KBB is showing $8,890 as a fair price. What's my best approach at talking the salesperson down to this price?

<TEXT> **RAM:** I thought that 16GB would enough.  Do you think having 32GB is necessary?

**Storage:** I will probably be working on one project at a time.  1TB may be enough for my OS+Apps+Current projects, but I can't really speak for future projects.  I edit a lot of documentaries that have a lot of huge files during the interviews.  I was actually considering buying 3 2TBs and setting up a RAID 5.

**PSU:** According to pcpartpicker, my build would be using 336W.  a 430W PSU will be enough?  I'm not too experienced so I'm not exactly sure if 600W is overkill or if it's necessary.

**Optical:** I haven't really had to burn any blu-rays, but we are about to submit our most recent doc to film festivals and I know that some festivals require a blu-ray submission.  I should probably buy a blu-ray burner.  Thanks.

**Monitor:** Do you know of any good 4k IPS that aren't too expensive?  I was looking at this one: [Dell P2415Q](http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Monitor-P2415Q-24-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00PC9HFNY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1439237490 sr=8-1 keywords=Dell+P2415Q)
I eventually want to have dual monitors.  When I have more money to spend I was thinking about adding on another one of these.   </TEXT>

**GPU**

As of right now, I'm not going to be color grading much 4k footage anytime soon.  I usually handle Canon DSLR and occasionally BMPCC footage.  I figured that when the time comes that I find myself editing a lot of 4k, I could upgrade my GPU.  Is the 750 TI enough for what I'm doing now?

**RAID and HDDs**

I would want to set up RAID 1 with the two 3TB HDDs.  I'm also considering buying 3 2TB HDDs instead and using RAID 5.  I'm a little confused however.  If I used RAID 5 with the three 2TB HDDs, how much storage space would I have? 2TB or 4TB?  If I'm working on one project at a time, I think 2TB will probably be enough.  I'll have to think about this one a bit more before I order anything.

As for the 4TB external, I was planning on using it for my backup and other random files.  Maybe it's not necessary to have the 4TB external.  

**Internal vs. External**

What are the pros and cons of having either?  Not really sure if there's a big difference between the two. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-06-25 01:06:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 
**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Editing videos filmed primarily with a Canon 60D (sometimes with higher end cameras, not any 4K yet) using Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Davinci Resolve, Lightroom/Photoshop, etc.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

Not going to use for gaming.  But I've been considering buying Battlefront for my PC.  How much more will I need to spend on my GPU if I plan on playing Battlefront? If I don't play any games though, will the 750 ti be enough?

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$2000

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States

Storage: Do you think I could get by with a 120gb SSD for OS and Apps? Or will I need 250gbs

GPU: I won't be gaming at all. Based on your reply, I'm assuming that video editing isn't too dependent on a good GPU? Why is that?

OS: Will Premiere Pro and other programs work correctly in Win10? I'm afraid of running into all these problem with the new OSs and I feel like I'd rather just play it safe with Windows 7. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I'll be editing video files using Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom, and Davinci Resolve.  Currently I'm filming with a Canon 60D, but I'll be upgrading soon and might possibly be working with larger files, like 4k.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$2000

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

I'm planning on buying the PC in about a month (4th of July) so I can take advantage of a sale hopefully.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Tower/OS/Monitor

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

California, USA.  No, I don't have access to a microcenter location.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

I'll be reusing a keyboard and mouse. Keyboard: Logitech S510. Mouse: Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I don't know. Will this be necessary for me? If anything, I can get into it down the line.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I was thinking maybe a 250gb SSD for my OS/Apps, and a 250gb or 500gb SSD as a scratch disk for projects and then a large HDD for long term storage.  

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

I just want a basic looking case with good airflow.  Nothing fancy.  

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

I need Windows 7. 

**Extra info or particulars:**

For now, I'm okay with only having one monitor to keep costs down, but eventually I'll want to have a dual monitor set up.   </TEXT>

So I need a pc that will be able to run Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects smoothly while handling large video files.  I'll eventually be working with 4k video files, so having tons of storage is a must.  I'm also considering having dual monitors.  I'm willing to spend up to $2000, is that enough? 

Also, I'm not in a huge rush to put it together.  What times of the year have the biggest sales? Sorry if these are dumb questions, I just don't have much experience and I'm looking to learn more! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best cheap on-camera shotgun to upgrade from built-in mic? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-18 04:57:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been debating on buying a little on-camera shotgun for my Canon 60D (with magic lantern).  I shoot a lot of skateboarding and I'm just looking for something cheap to upgrade from the built-in mic.  I have a Rode NTG-2/Tascam DR-60D set up for other gigs, but it's just not ideal for when I shoot skating.  

So far, I've been looking at either the Rode Videomic or Sennheiser MKE400.  What do you guys recommend? Or are there other mics for around the same price that are better?

Someone on my local craigslist is selling the MKE400 for $75.  Is it worth it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, yeah $40 isn't too bad.  I was just wondering if there were any cheaper options out there.  

I haven't looked at the 3DR Iris+.  What are the pros/cons? Better or worse than the phantom?  I'm iOS person.  

I've been pretty inspired by this [post](http://alaskavideoshooter.com/a-drone-for-all-seasons-dji-phantom-2-tips-for-aerial-filmmaking-gold/), so I haven't really been looking at any other multicopters. What's your opinion? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So say I wanted to get a revolving shot of a building, maybe 8 feet above the ground.  This clip would be used as part of a commercial.  Would I be contacted by the FAA?

That sounds like a good idea.  I'd much rather crash the Hubsan while learning than the Phantom.  Are there any cheaper options than the Hubsan?  I'd like to try and save money where I can considering I'm about to spend a lot on the phantom.

<TITLE> Question about quadcopters, filming, and legality. Is it worth it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-16 06:03:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm about to pull the trigger and buy a DJ Phantom 2.  I don't have any experience operating a quadcopter, but I've been researching and I'll be sure to take it very slow.  I understand that it's not a toy and that above everything else, be safe and smart about it.

However, while I do want to buy this for recreation and getting cool shots, I eventually want to use it to help on shoots for ads, music videos, or other commercial types of gigs (Once I'm 100% confident in piloting it).  My question is: **How legal is it to fly and use video from a quadcopter for commercial purposes?**  If I'm going to be using it in a professional setting, I'm worried that the quadcopter might cause me more tickets and headache than it's worth. 

Does anyone have firsthand experience or knowledge on this topic? What are the rules on the matter? Everywhere I've looked, I've gotten mixed answers.  

Edit: I'm from the US, California specifically. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Earlier this morning Florida State University was hit with a tragedy that's all too familiar to our Isla Vista Community. Three students were injured in the library located on the FSU campus as hundreds more hid behind bookshelves. Regardless of the details- the who, the where, the why - the feeling, no matter what, is unchanging. A sense of loss and fear that the places we find comfort in might no longer feel the same. Isla Vista went through this tragedy earlier this year and the outpouring of support we received from surrounding communities and universities guided us in the tough times. The beautiful messages and acts of kindness from strangers helped us realize that we were not alone and we, as a community would like to extend this same kindness to FSU in their time of need.

For these reasons, I want to create a video that will serve as a message to FSU from us, Isla Vista residents, reminding them to stay strong and that they will get through this, just as we still are.  If you or anyone you know are interested in contributing any kind of positive message and/or words of encouragement to students at FSU, email me at carterhiyama@gmail.com and I'll send you more details.  Shooting will begin on Friday 11/21. Please spread the word! And suggestions and advice would be appreciated as well </TEXT>

But now I'm looking into buying my own, but I'm not sure which to buy. Do you guys have any advice on the pros and cons of each? Or possibly know of anything better? Also, do you recommend any mics that work well and aren't too expensive? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm making a resume for a production internship and I'm not exactly sure what skills,experience, and/or awards are most valuable to possible production employers.  

Just to give you guys examples, I was a DP Intern at a small production company for 6 months, I am the filmer/editor at a local skateboard shop making advertisements and am currently in the process of making a full length film (including skits), I was nominated for best cinematographer at a local digital film festival, and I've also won 2nd place in a University of California wide video contest.  

Which of these things should I include or leave out?  I'm not sure what employers are looking for.  Also, do you have any other general rsum tips?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're welcome.  I'm just trying to spread awareness of these issues in our community by making videos like this to clear up any misconceptions or miscommunications that we have of IVFP as well as expressing our views and opinions on what they're doing.  I hope to see this video spread outside of /r/ucsantabarbara and my personal friends on Facebook so that our community in IV can be better educated as a whole.  Because let's face it, not every person in IV reads The Daily Nexus or other newspapers, but most people do have Facebook or some form of social media where they can hear about these issues and learn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is exactly why I'm going to start creating short videos that use interviews with students, student body, IVFP (hopefully), and any others that are concerned about these very issues.  I want to start making these videos in an attempt to publicize the student perspective in IV on problems like Deltopia, IVFP, and so on.  I'm currently in the process of interviewing the houses where the undercover cops came in and handed out MIP's in the hopes that more people become aware of what is going on.  I also want to interview other students that weren't involved with the sting to express our opinions on the situation and what that means for us. So if anyone would like to say something and be in the video, PM me and we can set something up. </TEXT>
