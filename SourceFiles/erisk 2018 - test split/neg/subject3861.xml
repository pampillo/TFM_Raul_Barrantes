<TEXT> A few individuals owning property is incompatible with socialism. It literally means the social ownership of the means of production by society as a whole. Any state or society that fails to meet this criteria is not socialist. That's always been the defining characteristic.

And that whole keeping what you earn thing is bs. How many wealthy people merely got their wealth from their parents? And besides, they all "earn" everything they have by profiting off the labour of others. If a worker produces X amount worth of product, why should the factory owner "earn" that product and not the worker? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it won him two terms, but the party shifted right. As a result, the new "centre" shifted right. Now the country is more right wing overall than it was. If we try to meet in the middle again, the centre will move even further right. It wins elections, but eventually defeats the point of being a left wing party. Hopefully the disaster that is Trump will enable the Democrats to make a strong leftwards swing and still crush the GOP in 2020. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The wave of automation should be embraced. Having a job isn't, and never should be the meaning of life. Once one is not required to take part in menial activities taken over by machines, they may utilise their newly found free time however they please, perhaps explore and develop their creativity or discovered talents. Once labour is no longer necessary, it is only logical that all wealth produced by machines be collectivised, since no one really has more of a right to capitalise off of automated labour than anyone else. </TEXT>

I don't think anyone needs convincing that the EC is shit, but it's also the House, which is gerrymandered to the point of no return, and the Senate, which is about as representative of the people as the estates general. Seriously, your senate vote can vary in value by dozens of times depending on where you live. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd have to disagree. I know a lot of people, even family members, who were totally unable to afford health insurance at all before the ACA, so they couldn't receive necessary treatments for pre-existing conditions, and now we might go back to that.

Regardless, all of the largest taxes created under Obamacare are placed on the wealthiest Americans, people who don't have to struggle to put food on their table. The people it helps most are those who have the hardest struggle- the poor and lower class. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not quite.

Le Pen is different from Trump. For one, the Le Pen name has loomed over French politics for what seems like forever. She is an established politician. Not only that, but Le Pen's economic policies are alien to the ideas thought up by the GOP. Le Pen can at least pay lip service to the welfare state.

Macron also has difference from Clinton. For one, he is much younger with much less experience. And he isn't running as part of an establishment party, his is brand new.

And Melenchon- he isn't even close to Bernie. Bernie in France would be considered establishment left. Melenchon is far to the left, a staunch anti-capitalist. 

Also, Le Pen doesn't really have a chance. I know people like to talk about how the polls are all wrong, but she's like 20 points behind. To be that far off would be unprecedented, a whole different league from Brexit or Trump. And Macron doesn't have to worry about having the election stolen from him by an undemocratic electoral system.

Honestly, it seems to me like Americans like to see every global event as an extension of their own country. Not everything is a parallel to America. </TEXT>

The number of people I know who understand nothing from Orwell and just think it means socialism=bad is just astounding. People fail to realise George Orwell was an anti-capitalist, and never intended to have his works interpreted as support for capitalism. The reason for that is they teach it that way in schools, I've had to sit through a teacher lecturing about how Animal Farm supports capitalism, even though that misses the whole point. Anyway, people forget that the main target of his criticism was authoritarianism in general. </TEXT>

I can't believe the Trump admin still hasn't come around to condemn what is going on in Chechnya. I guess it's a combination of Trump's love of Russia with the GOP's hatred of gay people that is leading to their inaction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed. From my personal experience, an incredibly large number of people are totally unaware that political positions left of liberalism even exist in any meaningful way. They see politics as a spectrum from "liberalism" as one extreme and "conservatism" as another. Which is frustrating because American liberalism is centrist at best, while all left wing ideologies are shunned as evil extremist commies. </TEXT>

You've confused poll numbers with approval ratings. What I said was that Mlenchon had the highest approval ratings. That means most people view him positively, even if they have some other first choice. The only people who like Le Pen are the ones voting for her in the first round. From these facts, one can infer that Mlenchon would win in the second round if he made it vs Le Pen. 

http://elabe.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/11042017_bfmtv_lexpress_intentions-de-vote-presidentielles-vague-8.pdf
You can also see here on page 17 that Mlenchon polls ahead of Le Pen in round 2 by a 61% to 39% lead.

So who has no clue what they're talking about? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well this really is a challenge. Hard to actually solve this without resorting to ASB. The only thing I could think of is maybe in an alternate timeline slaves are mainly taken from only Muslim sections of West Africa, and a lot more of them are taken by the slave trade. If enough slaves were imported, they could become a majority in a couple of southern states, but I don't see that realistically happening. If this was the case though, you would obviously see more numerous and successful slave revolts, weakening the confederacy significantly. This would probably be occurring even before the Civil War. Likewise, in the revolutionary war, Britain would likely appeal to the enslaved population more intensely, encouraging them to help them in the war in return for their garunteed freedom. This could have been an effective strategy if slaves were so numerous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, the Portuguese Restoration War would have to have never happened, and the Iberian Union survives, with its members fully integrated. The French phase of the Thirty Years' War goes terribly wrong for France, and Spain is able to take southern portions of France in the 1640s. The Peace of Westphalia goes very well for them, although they begrudgingly release the Netherlands, fed up with obnoxious rebellions. Meanwhile, many of Europe's Protestant states have been forcibly converted back. Spain has made itself into an even greater power, and now is the most powerful in Europe. France is weakened severely, and has lost most of its Mediterranean coast. They probably never take Corsica in this scenario, and Genoa has it for the moment. Sometime over the next hundred years, Naples either goes free or goes to Austria. It is possible that in this timeline, Italian nationalists reach out to Spain for help instead of France in the mid 1800s, letting Spain keep Sicily and Sardinia, and giving them Corsica. Later, since Spain is still the greatest colonial power and was never trampled by Napoleon, they get a large chunk out of North Africa. The Sahel is basically there's for the taking, and they've made significant gains even before the scramble for Africa. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, considering Gran Colombia didn't even stay together, and Bolivar wasn't the one who liberated Argentina(San Martin) or Chile(O'Higgins), an empire from Panama to Patagonia would be an incredible challenge.

But, if Gran Colombia stayed together (not too unfeasible), but with Bolivar as its monarch, I can definitely see the easy acquisition of Bolivia and Peru. The biggest challenge comes with Argentina and Chile. It would really all depend on how genuinely sincere their leaders were about Latin American nationalism, and how willing they were to disregard republicanism. But, since this is a hypothetical, let's just say Chile and La Plata both saw it in their interest to join with Bolivar.

This new Empire would become the greatest power in the New World, given time to consolidate. It would probably wage frequent wars with Brasil, usually winning, in an attempt to unite South America. It's hard to say how they would interact with the US or Europe. Regardless, if they could stay together, they would become a full-fledged power at the level of Europe's powerful states. They may not be as active in international affairs, taking an isolationist approach like the US. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I'd say he's probably the most controversial of the past century. 

http://www.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx

Presidential approval ratings are generally quite high towards the start of one's term, while Trump's is not.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/13/politics/donald-trump-approval-poll-low-gallup/

Of course the civil war being a thing kind of prevents him from being the most controversial ever, but you later specify post-Civil War. 1876 was also a big one, since the electoral vs popular vote totals were pretty mismatched and the issues surrounding the end of the Reconstruction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I would guess that if the American Revolution never happened, the colonists  would end up in a situation similar to Canada, with devolved autonomy by the mid 1800s. They might have even been incorporated into the same entity as the dominion of Canada, and the Eastern US and Canada fully independent as one country after WWII. Probably the Northwest as well, since Britain would likely still have been interested in that territory, and taken them easily without serious competition. Mexico might still have the SW US, assuming no conflict analogous to the Mexican-American War happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heh. I found that joke particularly funny, being from Florida.

To answer your question, the Normans of Northern France are different because they actually come from Scandinavian descent. The Vikings began raiding the area around 800 CE. In 911 CE, the Franks agreed to recognise the Dutchy of Normandy, lead by Rollo. Over time, the Scandinavians who lived there sort of integrated into the French population. As far as surnames go, having a Norman one as opposed to a French one means it probably come more from Scandinavia. Hope that helps. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How did the Mongol empire maintain its massive size? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-14 02:34:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Besides the Mongols, it seems every other empire in the times when horseback was the quickest form of communication, that basically every other empire reached a limit and were unable to expand beyond, due to the hassle of keeping together such far flung territories. 

Yet the Mongols took most of Asia before splitting into fragments. The effect was delayed, and they somehow managed to keep them long enough to conquer the continent. I've heard a few explanations for this. The Mongols were incredible in the art of intimidation, so their ruthlessness might have deterred potential rebellions. I've also heard about the role their religious tolerance and general acceptance of other cultures(except Chinese culture) sort of kept it together. Yet it seems like both of those could apply to others. Many other central Asian empires were about as ruthless, and the Achaemenids were renowned for their religious tolerance and effective bureaucracy, something the Mongols, to my knowledge, were totally lacking in. 

So, what made Mongolia the exception as opposed to other groups with similar characteristics and/or superior governing structures? </TEXT>
