I mean, I understand some of his contemporaries but I can't for the life of me ever understand Dickens. I'd like to read him because I think his prose is beautiful but the problem is I can't comprehend much of it. Do you guys have any tips on tackling Dickens?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yesterday I went to my a psychiatrist's office and was formally diagnosed as bipolar 1. Though I feel that I should have been diagnosed with cyclothymia but the problem is I haven't had it for 2 years, only about a year, year and a half at most. But I don't fit the criteria for mania or major depression. I've had major depression before this all started and it doesn't feel like anything I'm experiencing now. I call it depression-lite. And I feel like more fall in line with hypomania than mania. What do I do?

<TITLE> How do you get your reading stamina back after years of mental health problems? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-13 19:47:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since 2014 (the year I graduated high school), I've been having a host of mental health problems, which caused me to not be able to read. The concentration I earned from elementary school through high school had been completely obliterated, I couldn't even finish a book, and when I did, it took me almost a year. Currently I'm trying to read *A Clash of Kings, Pride and Prejudice, As I Lay Dying, and Tess of the D'Urbervilles.* They aren't hard books to read, I'm just concerned with my current reading stamina. I used to be able to read all day, in fact, when I was in classes I didn't care for, I just read the whole time. It seems like a stupid question, I know, but how does one get that kind of stamina back?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>    Jacaerys couldn't sleep. He rolled left, right, and left again but his mind would not give in. Ever since his grandfather had told him that he had found a match for him, he had not slept well. All he could think about is what she'd be like, what she'd look like, if they'd get along well, and more importantly, if he'd make a good husband. 

   He tip toed out of his room and down the spiral staircase, the stone was cold on his bare feet, a relief from the sultry air in his room. 

"Master Jacaerys, what are you doing up?" a lone maid said, dusting the furniture.

"Hmm?" he said, not realizing she was there. "Oh nothing, thinking is all."

"About what my lord?" she asked, tucking a strand of black hair behind her ear.

"Oh, just the future," he said, finally looking at her. 

   She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She had curly black hair that went down to the middle of her back, light green eyes, and tanned olive skin. Jacaerys wondered if it was too late to get out of the engagement, for he knew that no woman was as beautiful as her. 

"Are you new? I don't recall us having a maid as beautiful as you, I would have remembered," he smiled.

She chuckled, "Yes, my lord. I previously worked in Sunspear."

"What did you do there?" he asked, taking a seat on the couch. 

"I worked in a whorehouse," she said, dusting the mantle.

Jacaerys looked down, "Ah. I'm sorry."

"Don't be, I made a lot of money whoring," she chuckled.

"Why did you quit then, surely you made more than you do here?" he asked.

"I got tired of it. So when Lord Aron came to Sunspear looking for maids, I thought it was the perfect time to leave," she said, sitting down beside him.

"Would you like a drink? I know where my grandfather keeps the good wine," he smiled.

"Let's go," she said, getting up off the couch.

   Jacaerys couldn't remember anything after that. To him, it was a blur of laughter, drinking, and passionate love making. He woke up the next morning in a daze, naked, lying in his bed. The maid's side of the bed was still hot. *Where has she gone off to?*  </TEXT>

[M] Sounds like a no, it's not, she's just a ward of the Hightowers right now. Also, I'm not sure if you're new or not, but never ask larger houses for a betrothal, most of the time it's a no since we're not very prominent, but occasionally it can be a yes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oldtown was just how her sister Nymella described it, it almost seemed endless. And the people, the amount of people she had seen in Oldtown made Sunspear look like a wasteland; people were packed into every street corner. Whether it be whores flirting, butchers chopping up meat, or drunks fighting in the streets; she loved it. 

"Oldtown is wonderful," she said, looking around.

"Come, we must meet Lady Dyanna," her grandfather said, walking faster. "She'll be expecting us."

"Grandfather, slow down, wouldn't you like to look around?" she asked.

"No, Lady Dyanna is expecting us, now come," he said, looking behind.


When they finally got to the Hightower, Jeyne couldn't believe how huge it was. She tried to look all the way up, but even at 180 degrees she couldn't see all the way up. 

"We're here to see Lady Dyanna," Ser Aron smiled.

"Come," the tall guard said.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Princess Arianne Martell,

 Princess Arianne, I write to you today in hopes of asking for a betrothal between your granddaughter, Alyse Sand and my grandson, the future Knight of Spottswood. True, we are a small and unimportant house, however we make up for it with our unwavering loyalty to House Martell. I believe this would be a good match for both parties, I pray to the Seven that you think likewise. 

 Sincerely,

 Ser Aron Santagar, Knight of Spottswood  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-06 19:05:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I mean, I get it, she's tired of raising kids, but it's like she completely forgot about her being their guardian. I do agree that everyone needs to take on more responsibility in the house, but threatening to kick out your children if they don't pay rent is over the line, especially with Carl, since he's the one who bought the house. Technically, Fiona bought it but Carl was the one who provided the money, she wouldn't have a pot to piss in if it wasn't for him. I also think throwing everything on Lip abruptly was a fucked up thing to do, she's telling everyone to take more responsibility, yet she's not taking it when it comes to the kids, does she not know she's legally responsible for them? The judge told her this would be a big burden and she still said yes, she should've listened to the judge if she was going to pull some shit like this. I hope I'm not the only one who thinks she was a total bitch in season 7. 

Don't even get me started with her leaving Harri with Debbie while she was in an interview so she could get a job like Fiona told her to do. Seems like the entirety of season 7 is just her shirking domestic responsibilities.

I'm done with Fiona. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is going to be a stretch but here we go, hopefully someone else will like the idea. I would have the game take place during the age of the Roman Empire, from it's infancy to its death, obviously spanning multiple generations and multiple Assassins/Templars (that way you get both sides of the conflict.) The Templars would be the nobility and other prominent people during that time period while the Assassin's would be just another random guy/gal in the crowd. When you're an Assassin your goal will be to take down the Roman Empire from it's roots by infiltrating the government and assassinating Templars as usual, or you can let them live, that's another thing I'd add: Dialogue choices. That and assassinations would be completely free, no optional objectives or anything, you see a guy, you take  him out your way, no illusion of choice like Syndicate. And you have a town that's your base and you can obviously upgrade it and watch it change throughout time (same goes for Templars.) When you're a Templar though you focus on taking out the Assassin's all threw out the Roman Empire from Bethlehem to Britain and everywhere in between, maybe even other places the Roman Empire tried to conquer. Obviously there would be many weapons, and a myriad of gear/weapon upgrades, collectibles, and base/town upgrades (like in 2 I believe, haven't played it, but I remember someone telling me that was a thing in one of the games. I'd add naval combat and you're on ship, but I wouldn't personally make it upgradeable, just really to get you from place to place, and maybe the occasional naval battle.

I would have it be a completely open world, no locked doors; an open world  like Witcher 3. I would take Syndicates day/night cycle and mash it with Unity's graphics and fine sense of detail, and have it run well. The map would be at least four times bigger than BF. 

Ah, oh well. I'm afraid this game will never get made. Our current consoles/PCs couldn't take it.  </TEXT>

For the most part it had pretty enjoyable missions (same could be said about Rogue though) and a nice amount of side activities (more would always be nice imo, but c'est la vie.) But then again I haven't played 1,2, Revelations, Brotherhood, Liberation, or Unity so I could be dead wrong. If it isn't, which one in your opinion is the Goldilocks of the franchise so far? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been out of high school for about 3 years now (it'll be 3 in June) and haven't done anything with my life so far. No job, can't drive (medical condition), and severely depressed and suicidal. The only thing I've ever wanted to do with my life was write for a living and just to be told that it's a stupid idea by society, it just ripped my fucking heart out. Honestly, if I can't make it as a writer, I'm gonna wind up killing myself, I can't stand the thought of being a wage slave, I'd honestly rather be dead. I don't know how so many people do it. 

Anywho, time for the question. What do I do now? Do I continue trying to write even though I can never completely finish a project, or should I just end it all. It's really one or the other at this point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd have to disagree. Of course it wasn't as flashy as Unity, but at least it wasn't nearly as buggy (not to say Syndicate is flawless in that department, it's not) as Unity was; I mean there's still numerous bugs that the patches failed to fix. It's better than when it first came out, much better, but I'd still reckon it's buggier than Syndicate. I do agree with you though about customization, there wasn't as many options as I would've preferred, compared to what seemed to be endless customization in Unity, I guess that's just the trade off.  I don't know about that last one, the side quests were pretty interesting, and they tied into the story pretty well. </TEXT>

I still can't believe that Ragnar isn't gonna be on the show anymore; it's gonna be so weird next episode when he isn't there. I know Travis Fimmel is unlikely to ever read this, but if he by any chance does, I just want to say: Travis Fimmel played the role masterfully, so masterfully that I'm genuinely concerned for the show's safety. He has to win for an award for this episode. 

Don't even get me started on the flashbacks, talk about feels. </TEXT>

As you can tell, I'm severely depressed and have one foot out the door already. How do you guys handle being wage slaves? Or, if you're not, how did you avoid it? Thinking of only living my life just to survive sounds God awful, I can't take it anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sad thing is, there are actually areas on Earth where Christians are persecuted and they're even killed if anyone finds out, but Americaisn't one of them.

America was never a Christian country but the majority was always Christian, and because of that, they got special privileges, and now since there are other people of different religions (and some without) living in America, they don't want their children force fed Christianity at school, and they don't want it involved in the government either, which is understandable, no religion should have an upper hand in the state. But since Christianity has always had an upper hand in America and now it's being brought down to a level playing field, they think they're being persecuted because they're losing their special privileges. </TEXT>

Usually those are in form of just jotting notes down in a doc.

<TEXT> Selwyn was strolling in the garden, thinking about Avia and his future with her when his elderly grandfather came up behind him. He was wearing a blue doublet with a leopard pin on his left breast. His once bald head had begun to grow shaggy white hair. 

"Grandfather, are you all right? You don't look too well," Selwyn said, hoping he didn't just offend his grandfather.

"Except for being old, I'm quite well," the old man smiled, "How are you, Selwyn?"

"I'm fine, grandfather," he lied.

"What's wrong Selwyn?" Ser Aron asked again.

"I've always wanted a boy," he said looking up into the cloudless sky, "but I'm afraid that Avia doesn't wish to have children."

"Nonsense, why wouldn't she, look at you, Selwyn!" he said jokingly. "These things take time, don't worry. In fact, your grandmother and I didn't have your uncle until the third year."

Somehow that made Selwyn feel better, he decided to go up to his room to see his beautiful lady, smiling all the way there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was surprised when I found out that I was an INFP, well not completely, but a little. I am an idealist, like everyone else here, but I can be quite cynical and a bit of a misanthrope, it's just, I'm severally disappointed in humanity. I mean, we have to forcibly kick natives out of their homes because there's oil? That's absolutely disgusting, this is just one example, there's plenty more. As for what I meant when I said "rebellious," I meant non conformist, anti government, etc. I think I'm going to end this, I fear if I go on too long, I'll start ranting.

Question: what causes an INFP to become misanthropic and cynical? </TEXT>

And, since he's her favorite, since I'm not "normal" enough for her, she believed him automatically, even though my brother is a pathological liar. She called me lazy and said why don't I get a job and do something with my life, all while in the middle of a depressive episode. Honestly, I still wouldn't do it, but this has got to be the most I've ever thought about doing it. I mean, she was right, don't get me wrong. I tried to tell her their was something wrong with me, but all she could think about was me calling her a bitch, which was admittedly wrong. Damn temper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Selwyn couldn't help but feel sorry for his wife, no lady deserved to see someone die, especially not one so beautiful. He embraced her tightly but said nothing, for nothing could make this better but time. He reached into his pocket and gently wiped her tears with a blue and white handkerchief. 

"Don't worry my love, I'm not very much interested in jousting," he chuckled trying to make her feel better. "I promise I'll die old in our bed."

He knew he couldn't control how he would die, for all he knew, he could die on a hunt, jaguars have killed many men and nothing is stopping them from killing him, but he lied anyway, he didn't wish to see his wife so upset.

"Is there anything I can do for you, my love?" he asked, gently.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It had been a long night, luckily for him, he couldn't remember half of it, the last thing he could remember was taking that brunette girl, what was her name again? Vaelana? It didn't matter, the only thing that mattered right now was this headache. *By gods, next time I've got to go easier on the wine. Oh who am I kidding? Ughhh.*

"Are you all right?" the brunette beside him asked.

He removed the blankets and got up out of bed, groaning, "What happened last night?"

She looked at him and chuckled, "Your guess is as good as mine."

With that, he put clothes back on and headed out of the pillow house.

"Wait, you forgot your chain," she pointed down at the floor, for she couldn't pick it up. "Are you a maester?"

"I was," he said, picking up the chain. "Though I don't very well think they'll want me back."

"Why do you say that?" she asked, intrigued about what had happened to Quentyn.

"It's a long story," he said, looking for the glass candles in his robe. Luckily, he found them.

"Well, Vaelana," he said, still unsure of her name, "It was nice to meet you."

"My name's Jeyne," she said, grabbing the blanket to cover herself up.

"Ah, doesn't matter really. Who is Vaelana then? I suppose that doesn't matter much either. Any who, it was a pleasure to meet you," he lied.

She scoffed and left, the blanket leaving a trail behind her. Quentyn shrugged and left the dusty old pillow house.

When he got out pillow house, the streets of Lannisport were just beginning to wake. The sky was blue with wispy streaks of pink running across of it. The air smelled like fish and fresh bread, and the only sounds that could be heard were the sounds of the dock workers talking, and high above them stood Casterly Rock.

<TEXT> *Unbelievable, I gave over half my life to the Citadel, and they play a fucking trick like this? That candle can be lit, I know it, those old fat men just don't like magic, that's what it is.*

Quentyn crept down the large hall of the Citadel in the dead of night, the only thing that could be seen was the braziers and the torches hanging on the wall. He grabbed a torch as quiet as he could, and continued creeping down the hall, looking fo that door he had passed a million times. *My gods, where is this damn door?* The next thing he knew, he was standing in front of an obsidian black door. He grabbed the knob, which was cold as ice, and twisted it. As the door began open, it creaked loudly, as if it were warning the other maesters. He opened the door, held the torch in front of him, and saw it.

The room itself was pitch black, so dark, it almost looked as if it were endless. He moved the torch down, and saw the flame's reflection on the glass candle. *Gods be good, there they are.* There had to be at least a dozen in the room. He put the torch down, away from the candles, and picked up three and stuffed them in his cloak. *Since you're not using these, you wouldn't mind if I take them, would you?*

He picked up the torch and headed out of the black room. As he closed the creaky door, he could sworn he heard footsteps coming close. He quickly put the torch back in its and ran for the main hall. He was almost there when he saw the shadow of a guard standing in front of him. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [M/20] Just Another "Am I bipolar" Post </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-13 15:38:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last winter, when I was seeing someone, they diagnosed me as having major depression. And of course having depression things were grim, I was always mopping around and being sad thinking about death, etc. We all know how depression goes. Then only yesterday, almost a year later, I came to the realization that things were different. I was no longer really physically sad, maybe I got good at hiding it? So I started looking up the symptoms for bipolar (since my grandfather was at one point a heavy drinker and I've heard that substance abuse and bipolar go hand in hand.) And I have quite a lot of symptoms of bipolar II but definitely not I. It almost as if all the hopelessness and the sadness dug itself inside me and I was left with a "normal shell," so on the outside I seem relatively normal. I also noticed that I, a saver of money, started spending the money I had, not on anything dangerous, just stuff on Amazon. In fear of making this drag on to long, I'm also: restless, occasionally have insomnia, thoughts of suicide, and I speak really fast (which I heard could be a sign?) I don't know if this counts as hypomania, but I went at least 3 or 4 days without getting much sleep and felt fine (wish I had that now, tbh (got six and have a headache.)

Now, I don't know if I suffer from Bipolar II or not, but something has definitely changed from last year. Also If I may sum up my moods really quickly. It seems like I go from sort of manic to sort of depressed (but not full blown like I had last fall/winter.)

EDIT: I could really use some booze, but I'm afraid I'll start beating people up like my grandfather. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nymeria really didn't want to go to Starfall, her grandfather said it would be "good for the family" if she went. *One day your father and I will be gone, we will need alliances if our house is to continue.* She could hear the words echoing in her head, and they made her stomach knot. 

She came back to the real world, and saw the craggy Red Mountains of Dorne and in the distance she saw a keep they called Starfall. She couldn't help but think of the old legend her father told her about Starfall. *Long ago, a man tracked a shooting star and it landed where Starfall is today. He forged a sword out of that star and it's believed that that sword, is Dawn.*

"Can we speak to Lady Clara Dayne?" her escort asked.

"Who shall I say is here?" the tall guard asked

"Lady Nymeria Santagar," he said, looking up at the majestic keep.

"Yes uncle?" Selwyn said, sipping on the wine in his cup. 

"There's someone I'd like you to meet, Lord Anders Blackmont," Aron said, taking the cup from Selwyn's hand.

Lord Anders, it is a pleasure to meet you," Selwyn smiled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jacaerys woke at dawn, he couldn't sleep a wink. All he thought about was living at Godsgrace. What would it be like? Would he make any friends? Surely he'd make one friend, at least, he hoped he would, for he'd be quite lonely if he didn't. After thinking about future friends, and what Godsgrace would be like, he thought about not seeing his mother or his father. He shook the thought off because he knew he'd start crying if he continued thinking about it.

It wasn't as hot as home, Jacaerys was quite glad he didn't have to put up with the blazing heat of the coast. The trotting of his horse across the field made his eyes heavy, he was asleep in minutes.

***
He awoke to the sight of Godsgrace. *Whoa, this place is huge, even bigger than Spottswood!* He couldn't believe the size of Godsgrace, and couldn't believe he'd have the privilege of living in such a place.

Moments later, guards came out to great them. Unlike Spottswood, these guards better, he couldn't think of the the word, but they just looked better to him. A tall guard came up to his escort and said "What business do you have here?"

"We have come to see Lady Delonne Allyrion. Young Jacaerys here is her new ward." </TEXT>

<TEXT> While sitting in his chambers, he couldn't help but think of the girl who sat across from her. What was her name again? Oh yes, Rana. He enjoyed her company well enough, at least, more than the other ladies his father had tried to set him up with. As looked out the window at the night sky, only one person could come to mind. Lysandra. The moon was a milky white, just like her skin. The stars, a pale yellow, just like her long locks. Everything seemed to remind him of Lysandra. *If only I could have her, just for a night.*

The window view did not satisfy him enough, so he walked down to the courtyard and sat on the edge of the fountain, looking up at the heavens. It was a dark night, and unusually cold for Dorne, he couldn't remember when it had ever been this cold. The only sound that could be heard was the trickle of the water in the fountain. 

He sat for a long time, thinking about Lady Rana and what a life with her would look like, which he found quite odd. He had never thought of a lady so much, except for Lysandra, of course.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jaehaerys started out of the window of his room. *Who is that? Oh gods, not another marriage proposal.* He moved closer, almost half out the window and saw the banners of House Ladybright. *A Ladybright? Is this the best the old man could do? Let's get this over with.* 

He walked down the old spiral staircase, thinking about what this one would be like. *Maybe she'll be better* The optimist in him said, though a part of him doubted it. 

"Jaehaerys!" he heard his sister in law Lysandra yell, coming up the stairs. "Come, you have a visitor!"

"I don't want to marry the Ladybright girl," he said, stopping.

Lysandra walked back up the stairs. Jaehaerys looked into her deep purple eyes, they were absolutely beautiful, just like the rest of her. 

"Just talk to her," she said, leaning on the wall, panting.

"Is it the baby?" He asked, focusing all of his attention on her.

"No, no yet," she panted. "Go downstairs."

He walked downstairs, despite every bone in his body saying to stay with her. 

His father was standing at the base of the staircase. He looked much older now. His once dark hair was now a greyish white, and his once smooth skin was wrinkled like a raisen that sat in the sun for too long. 

"Come we have vistors," Ser Aron smiled, taking his son's arm.

As he walked out to greet the visitors, he couldn't help but look back at Lysandra. Even pregnant, she was as beautiful as ever.

That sentence would be a major problem to any native Latin speaker, luckily like has a standard word order! </TEXT>

Tarquinius Superabus was the king of the Romans and Sextus Tarquinius was the wicked son of the tyrant. He raped Sextus Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus and a good woman, because of a great love of virtue, she killed herself. The ancient Romans were always praising the virtue and high spirits of Lucretia and they were blaming Tarquinius. 

Catullus Dedicates His Poetry Book

EDIT: In the second sentence of the second reading, it looks like the name Cornelius is in the genitive, and that's how I originally translated it, but thinking about, I realized a genitive there sounded odd and just translated it as "Cornelius" on Reddit.

<TEXT> Today I was doing some HIIT for about 30 minutes and after my heart rate was 125 bpm. I know, not good at all. I was sweating and breathing hard like usual but after I was done (cooled down really fast btw) I started researching if what I was doing had any benefit (not weight wise but like heart health, endurance, etc) and it seems like you only get benefits from 160-180 bpm. I'd like to go that fast, but my stationary bike isn't very good and when I go to fast, the foot strap comes off. I mean today when I was at 125 bpm the strap came off and I almost broke my foot. It's a shame too, because I wasn't even tired. 

Also I'm not completely sure if it's 125, because I just took out my phone and started counting til the minute changed. For all I know it could've just changed to 7:56 a second a go or changed 30 seconds ago. At minimum I got 125 bpm. Maximum sure as hell wasn't 160-180 bpm.

Next time reckon I should just use the timer.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Critique] What do you think of the first poem I've ever written </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-09 05:21:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is just as short poem that I through together about twenty minutes ago, it's not that good, I know but my life's been pretty rough so I thought writing it down would help. I promise I don't suck this bad writing a novel.

Anywho, hope it's not too bad:

"What did I ever do to you?" You'd ask foolishly, knowing full well what you did.

You ruined my childhood.

Instead of loving words I got abuses thrown at me.

Instead encouragement I got a father who laughed at my weight

Instead of father who supports their child's interest, I got one who laughed at them, calling them "girly" or "stupid."

Instead of fatherly advice, I got beatings that left me black and blue

And instead of a father, I got an abuser.

So next time when you stand on my front porch asking me to take you back, prentending that you did nothing wrong

You can go to hell. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is HIIT style cardio twice a week too much or too little? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-05 00:46:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I say "HIIT style" because it isn't sprinting. Believe me, I'd like to do it that way but the right foot strap on my stationary bike comes off if I go too fast and I'm not in the mood to break my feet, so I have to control it. It's still fast (for a fat guy.) 

The reason I asked twice a week is because I'd prefer to do my cardio on shower days.

Even though I'm fat, I'm not doing this for weight loss, I'm just trying improve my overall heart health. If I happen to loss a couple of pounds in the process, that's nice too. As you can tell, I'm new to cardio.

Another question: if I stick to this plan, will I get the results I'm looking for?

EDIT: I'm M20 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if I translated everything correctly in Cicero's little paragraph "The Rarity of Friendship."

"Pauc vir vrs amcs habent, et pauc sunt dign. Amcitia vra est, praeclra, et omnia praeclra sunt rra. Mult vir stult d pecni semper cgitant, pauc d amcs, sed errant: possumus valre sine mult pecni, sed sine amciti non valmus et vta est nihil."

I got: "Few men have true friends, and few are worthy. True friendship is remarkable, and all remarkable friendships are rare. Many foolish men always think about money, few about friends. but they err: we are able to be well without much money, but without friendship we are not well and life is nothing."

I don't see any problems with it, but I by no means a great Latinist. That's why I came to you guys! xD </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sentence is "Is qu Vi Latn venit per portam Capnam Rmam intrat." I believe I know all of the technical things happening in this sentence, I just cannot translate it into English for the life of me.

"Via Latina" is obviously an ablative, "Per portam Capenam" is an accusative of movement, and "Romam" is the locative.

When I try to translate it, I get "He who comes by Via Latina through Porta Capena enters Rome." I've tried every combination, but none makes sense. What am I doing wrong? </TEXT>

<TEXT> After birth, all Ashara could think about was sleeping, and how good it would be to take a nap right now. She felt a little guilty for wanting to go to sleep, after all, she just brought her first child into the world. But there's one thing no one ever tells you about birthing a child: how exhausting it is. She looked down at the baby lying in her arms, he was wrapped in a blanket, sleeping. He looked so peaceful when he slept, and truth be told, she was a bit jealous that he got to sleep.

"Would you like to hold him?" Ashara asked, half asleep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After a *long* day of watching the joust, the melee, and the archery competition, he just wanted to eat, so he made his toast quick.

"Lords and Ladies of Westeros, thank you for coming to Spottswood!" he yelled, raising his glass. 

Unlike him the toast was quick, and somewhat impersonal, as he was quite tired, he didn't care much, but inside he did feel a bit guilty.

[M] Not much, have to go to work. In case you missed in the winners were: Ser Tommard Rosby in the josut, Lady Cassena Storm in the melee, and Bearn Cafferen in archery.

Open rp to all who attended the event, go wild in the comments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ran across this sentence in Lingua Latina "Mdus vi Latn Tscul Rmam ambulat." This might seem like a simple sentence and a silly question, but I don't want to get anything wrong. I think it means "Medus walks Via Latina from Tusculum to Rome." Also, why isn't Via Latina in the accusative? Isn't the object of this sentence?

EDIT: Reading farther, I've found that it happens a lot. It's not hard or scary, I'm just wondering if this could be anything else or am I right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He hadn't been back to Spottswood since before they left for the King's Wedding and Jaehaerys didn't want to go back, then he'd have to see that traitor. *I can't believe he flirted with that Storm bitch. If he wants to be a Stormlander so bad, he should just move there, he'd fit right in.* As he pulled up to Spottswood, the once loving place where he learned to be a man, where he learned to fight, and where he had learned about love, became nothing but a reminder of Rhaego's betrayal, all he could think about was that Storm bitch, and it made him sick to his stomach. *Even swine are better than a Stormlander.*

Two guards were standing outside. One was a portly old man, the other a lanky dark haired boy no older than 19. The sky was a mixture of Martell red and orange and Baratheon yellow, the latter made him only think of that Dondarrion bastard, which made him even sicker. *How the hell could a Dornishman flirt with a Stormlander, disgusting.* The air smelled of salt, and the sound of waves crashing the shore filled the air. 

"My lord, do you need help off your horse?" the portly guard asked.

"No, I'm fine," Jaehaerys slurred. "Where is Rhaego?"

"He's in his room, my lord," the lanky guard said.

Jaehaerys ran pased the guards, knocking the portly one over. _That son of bitch thinks he's gotten rid of me, ha._ He ran a to Rhaego's room as fast as he could, thinking about how much he'll beat the shit out of him, his sword was itching to get out of its scabbard. _I won't kill him, a couple of clouts to the head should do the boy good, after all, killing him would be kinslaying._ When he finally got to Rhaego's door, he was completely high off of adrenaline not to mention the juice he'd been drinking all night. His lip trembled with anticipation, the hand on the hilt even more so.

"Rhaego!" Jaehaerys screamed, busting down the door.

"Jae?" Rhaego said, lifting his head up from his book.

<TEXT> ***7th Month, 315 Selwyn***

He had been in the Dornish desert for five months already, oh how the time flew by! It had almost been half a year since he'd seen his family, but it had seemed only yesterday when he left Spottswood. He knew that couldn't be true, do to the fact that he was changing so much. He had always been a bit of a late bloomer, and he knew that but squiring for Ser Gerold had changed everything. Just in the last five months, he'd grown five inches! His hair had grown down to his shoulders and he had gained at least fifteen pounds of muscle. He had also started to grown some hair on his face, though it was still not much. He couldn't believe how much he'd changed. He also got better with a sword as him and Gerold were sparring almost every other night. If they weren't sparring, they were climbing the mountains (which made his huge hands almost as rough as the mountains themselves), or learning how to fight hand to hand. Selwyn swore he'd never let this trip change him, but it did. He never admitted to himself but it did, at least a little. He wasn't nearly as battle hungry as his father, but he did come to enjoy fighting with a sword and hand to hand, even got a bit good at it to be honest. Through all of that though, the old Selwyn was never lost. He still was soft and compassionate, a lover of books, the black sheep of the family. He had even learned some things that weren't combat related. 

In the back of his mind, he wondered what he'd be like in another six months and it both excited him, and scared him.

"My lady," he bowed. "If I may say, you did quite well today."

"My prince, I believe my daughter promised you a leopard at the Tully wedding a while back, a thousand apologies you haven't received it yet," he bowed. "I've just been so busy going to my children's weddings."

Then he had an idea, it could be a win win for everyone.

"Prince Lucky, would you be interested in coming to Spottswood on the first month of this up coming year? We're holding a festival for the realm and whilst there you could also get your leopard." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quentyn could see the lad was nervous, but he didn't say anything for that would've been rude. He had been surprised someone had came up to him at all, no one else had. Not in the three years he had been here had anyone else intuited conversation with him. Did they think him strange or rude? He shrugged off the thought and decided to make a new friend, surely he needed one, everyone needs at least one. 

He closed the old book he was reading, _The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling by Grand Maester Munkun_, and he looked at the boy intently. He had light brown hair which was a bit darker than his own and eyes as brown as fertile soil; he could only be a Reachman.

"Hi, I'm Quentyn Santagar," he smiled, holding out his big hand. "I see you and I are the only ones left in the library, more books for us." </TEXT>

<TEXT> **2nd month, 315**

It would be an understatement to say that Selwyn didn't want to leave Spottswood, after all, he didn't even want to become a warrior, it was his grandfather and father who made him go. _Seven hells, I told father I didn't want to become a knight but as usual he didn't listen. I'm surprised mother didn't say anything about me leaving for a whole year, but she probably wants me to leave too! Ughh, the whole lot of them, all they care about is fighting, it's a fucking disease with them._

"Selwyn, be safe," his mother Rhaenys said, rocking his little sister Jeyne back and forth in her arms.

_Fuck you._

"Son, don't fuck too many whores, you're bound to get one pregnant," his father said, taking another swig of wine from the glass bottle.

_Typical, Ser Lorence Santagar, he couldn't even tell his own son goodbye because he's that emotionally unavailable, fuck you too dad._

Last but not least was his grandfather. He was close to him, closer to him than his actual parents. He wanted to say "fuck you" to his grandfather too for doing this to him, for sending him with some false knight out into the desert but every time he did he couldn't help but think of all the good memories he and his grandfather shared. The countless hours reading together in his study, all of the chess games they had played, even the losses made him nostalgic. He couldn't bring himself to say that to a person he actually loved.

"Well Selwyn, I'll see you in a years time," Ser Aron said, a bit teary eyed, but holding it together well.

"As will I, grandfather. Hopefully when I return, I'll be a man," he said, thinking about how hot the Dornish desert was.

"Aye, and maybe you'll learn to be a knight too," Ser Lorence stammered. 

"Lorence!" Rhaenys shouted in shock.

"What, the boy is already fifteen. I lost mine when I was fourteen to a whore in Sunspear," he smiled, his teeth stained purple from the wine.

"Well, I guess it's goodbye, Ser Gerold is outside now waiting for me. Hopefully I'll see you all in a years time," he waved as he walked out of the dining hall.

While walking out of the dining hall, Selwyn felt a little guilty for saying that to his parents. Sure, one was a brazen drunkard and the other a pushover when it came to her husband, but strangely, he would miss them.

<TEXT> "Of course it's not too much my lady! Please excuse me for just a moment," he said, putting his goblet on the nearby table.

A moment later, he whispered into the ear of a passing maid and then she scurried off. A few minutes later Rhaego arrived. He had long half black, half Valyrian blonde hair, deep purple eyes with blue flecks in them, and freckled pale skin.

"Rhaego, this is Lady Nymeria Artis of High Hermitage," Ser Aron said.

"My lady," Rhaego bowed.

In truth, Rhaego thought Lady Nymeria was absolutely beautiful, but of course, he didn't want to show all of his cards, at least not yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ser Aron looked at Lady Nymeria and saw that she had a cast on her arm and was scrapped up a bit, a small part of him couldn't help but to feel sorry for her, the injuries must hurt, but another part of him didn't feel sorry at all, instead, proud. Rand Jordayne was a big man and she went head to head with him for multiple rounds, he'd never met a stronger woman in his life and he would be proud to call her a daughter in law.

"My lady, you fought excellently today against Rand Jordayne," he smiled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **1st Month, 315**

After a long day of watching the joust, there was nothing Ser Aron wanted more than food, and boy was the joust close. Rand Jordayne and Gerold the Bastard, or *Ser* Gerold went head to head to the last round, neither once giving an inch and Lady Nymeria Artis of High Hermitage almost died. To say it was an eventful joust was a gross understatement. Thankfully, no one lost their lives today. Aron knew that he was expected to give a toast and maybe a little speech, but he was exhausted, he just wanted eat. So, he knighted the boy, Gerold, said the words, and let the Septon pour the oil over him, nothing fancy.

"Thank you all for coming. Now, let's eat!" he yelled, holding up his goblet of Dornish summerwine.

[m] go crazy guys, not going to organize the feast at all.

After a few minutes, they stopped at an old wooden door, the paint was slowly chipping off but you could see that it once was Santagar blue. 

"He should be in here, Gerold, I told him you were coming," she said opening the old door while making sure the baby was secure. 

  When the door opened, the room smelled of old paper but for some reason it was cool in the room, it had to be one of the coolest rooms in the keep. In the room sat a man at a messy desk reading. He was quite handsome for an older man as he was around 40. He had olive skin, black hair, and deep eyes.

"You must be Gerold, I heard you'd like to sign up for the tourney next month, I assume you'd like to joust?" He asked, writing down something in the old book. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The guards could smell his breathe a mile away, and it smelled like booze. The tall guard, Petyr, was deciding if he should let this Gerold fellow in. After all, he did come for the tourney.

"Come with me." Petyr said, as he opened the gate. "Stay out here Garrin."

   The short one, Garrin, nodded and put his visor back down.

"Before you meet with Ser Aron, we need to sober you up a bit more," Petry said, going towards the fountain.

   A moment later, Petry dunked Gerold's head in the cold fountain, his huge hand grabbed the nape of Gerold's neck and pulled him back up thirty seconds later. By that time, Gerold was soaking wet and gasping for air, all the while shivering.

"Someone get the boy a towel!" Petry yelled, his voice booming across the keep.

  A moment later, a woman came running down the hall with a baby and a towel in hand. She had wavy silver blonde hair, beautiful purple eyes, and skin as soft and white as Northern snow.

"Petyr stop yelling, you're going to wake the children! You already woke Nymeria, don't wake Jacaerys," she said, looking down at the baby in her arms.

"Apologies, Lady Lysandra," Petry whispered. "This man named Gerold has come to see Ser Aron."

  She turned to the boy and gave him the soft towel.

"Ser Aron is getting ready for the festival next month, but my husband Aron is here, come, he'll see to whatever you nee," Lysandra smiled.

  "So, what business do you have with Ser Aron?" she asked, walking down the hall. </TEXT>

It had been quite regular for drunks to come up to the guards so the two thought nothing of it, they'd seen a million drunkards come up to the gates of Spottswood and they were bound to see a million more.

"Unless you have an appointment with the knight of Spottswood, you best move along," the short one said, raising his visor to show his penetrating black eyes. </TEXT>

 I found out about a week ago, I was as surprised as you and also a bit scared and nervous, but I'm sure that's natural. I pray it doesn't come to a siege, and if it does, make sure to be as safe as you can, you have a family now. I haven't told either but I will write to them right after this letter, you're the first person I've told so far. I long to see you too, sweet Damian. I'll be keeping an eye out for you. I even told the guards do to the same and if they see you to come get me immediately, no matter what time it is. Please be safe.

 Love,

 Visenya


P.S. I've been thinking of some names. If it's a boy I'd like to name him Oberyn or Willem, I hope that sounds good to you, Damian. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  To the Lords and Ladies of Dorne,

 The Santagars will be hosting a New Years' festival this year at Spottswood. There will be a joust, a melee, and even an archery competition. This festival will begin on the first day of the first month. If anyone from your house is competing, please list who in your letter.

 Sincerely,

 Ser Aron Santagar, Knight of Spottswood </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Is he looking at me?* Ashara thought, playing with her curly brown hair.

She looked nothing like her mother, a Lysene, but like her father, a Santagar which made her jealous of her siblings. They had the light skin, purple eyes, and pale blonde hair of Old Valyria while she was more Rhoynish. She wore a simple blue dress and a necklace as she didn't care much for fashion, though she did make sure she looked nice for potential suitors though there were unlikely to be any tonight, just like every night. Her father told her "Lords and sers don't like tomboys, they want a proper lady." She didn't care. 

After a couple minutes passed she realized this mystery man was looking at her again, which made her quite embarrassed. In truth, she thought he was quite handsome and prayed to the seven he'd walk up to her. </TEXT>

A moment later, Daemon, Ser Aron's nephew, came up to him drinking wine.

"Uncle, have you seen any beautiful ladies yet? Oh, well it looks like we've found one uncle," Daemon bowed.

"Please excuse my nephew Daemon, he's a bit...aggressive when it comes to flirting," Ser Aron said, scratching his bald head.

"I am Daemon Santagar, and you are?" Daemon smiled ignoring his uncle and moving his silver blonde hair out of his face.

"It appears I'm overstaying my welcome," Ser Aron chuckled. "You kids have fun." </TEXT>

 I hope this letter finds you well, Damian because I have big news for you, you're going to be a father, the maesters said so. I hope this news does not come at a bad time, I know you're quite busy out in the field. How is it going out there? I miss you dearly Damian and I pray to the old gods and the new that you come back to us safely. I hope this letter doesn't make you come back home. Truly Damian, the men need you more than I right now. 

 Love,

 Visenya

After Visenya finished writing the letter, she paced back in forth in her room, wondering about the future of Damian and her, wondering if he'll make it back to Bear Island alive, and wondering what their child with accomplish in its lifetime. Eventually, she began to feel tired and laid down in her bed. Moments later, she was fast asleep dreaming about Damian. </TEXT>

I urged him not to my lord, I told him to marry the girl and suck it up, but he would not listen. I will tell you now so no one else tells you, Lysandra is almost due. My lord, I will do anything to rectify this travesty immediately." </TEXT>

Daemon prayed to the gods that he won her favor, though, he was up against heavy competition, mainly Alyn Velaryon, and knowing that fathers liked to set up their daughters with men of nobler families, he knew that he would pick Alyn for her but a little part of his mind refused to believe the notion.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It had been an arduous journey to Starfall, but a very beautiful one at that. The lowering sun looked absolutely gorgeous over the Red Mountains, like something out of the tales of old, and the best part? She was with Jonos. She couldn't believe he'd want to travel this far south. She warned him it would be hot, but he didn't seem to mind, he seemed like he liked the adventure, which was fine by her, because so did she. The castle was huge, she'd never seen anything like it. It was gran, it was regal, it was everything she wanted in a keep. In the back of her mind, she wondered if The Twins were as big as Starfall. 

"Rhealla Santagar and Jonos Frey to see Lady Clara," Rhaella said, looking up at the tall guard.

"Yes, we've been expecting you two. Excuse me while I go inform Lady Clara of your arrival," he said, going back into the huge castle while a much shorter guard took his place.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Lovely Lysandra (Part 2) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-29 18:28:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [m] Since I didn't post after I posted part 1, this'll just be a memory.

**Lys, 7th Month, 313**

Lysandra was absolutely beautiful, she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, definitely more beautiful than the Jordayne girl. Although, that made him feel quite guilty but he couldn't help it. She had to be the most beautiful girl in the world. She had pale blonde hair, dark purple eyes, and skin as white as snow with just the tiniest hint of a tan.

"So you must be Lovely Lysandra?" he asked.

"Yes," she said, taking a seat on the bed. "Come, sit with me."

"Okay," he gulped.

"You don't look like a Lyseni, where are you from?" she asked, staring at him intently.

"I'm from Dorne. The name's Aron Santagar, my lady," he smiled.

"Dorne, huh? I've been there once or twice, a nice place. Oh, I'm no lady, I'm just a common whore," she chuckled.

"None sense, you're absolutely beautiful," he smiled.

"Well thank you Aron, but truthfully, I'm just a common whore," she said lying back on the bed. 

"I can get you out of here," he whispered in her ear. "Under one condition."

"What's the condition?" she asked.

"That you marry me. I'm the heir to Spottswood and I need a wife and kid and since you are the most beautiful woman I've seen, I asked you. I was betrothed a while back, but I left. Please come back to Dorne with me," he said.

"I just met you," she said, sitting up. 

"It doesn't need to be a lavish ceremony. We can go to the septon and get married in secret. I will make sure you live a life of comfort, Lysandra," he said, looking her in the eye.

"Fine," she said.

"I'll inform my father that I've found a wife, and we'll be back in Spottswood by next month," he smiled.

He saw the look on her face and he could tell she wasn't sure. He knew because he made the same face when betrothed to the Jordayne girl. 

"If at any time, you don't want to stay, just leave. You are not my prisoner nor slave, you can leave whenever you like," he said, grabbing her hand.

 She told the brothel owner she quit and by the 8th month they were married, by the 9th they would be back in Spottswood.

 I'm quite glad you enjoyed the North and I hope you are well too, my prince! I do have my own leopard, his name is Aegon, named after your ancestor, Aegon the Conquer. I fear Prince Lucky that my father won't be available for some time, as he is coming north with my sister Ashara to marry her off to Manrel Stout. Rest assured, I will remind him once he comes to Bear Island.

<TEXT> Rhaegar and Rhaego finally arrived at Hellholt, after a month of travel, they were exhausted. The only thing that kept them going was meeting the beautiful Lady Tabitha, although she was a bit younger than them. When they arrived at Hellholt, they couldn't believe how unbearably hot it was. They were salt dornish so they were used to the heat, but the Dornish deserts were something else.

"We wish to see Lord Matthias Hellfyre. We are the Santagars," Rhaego said, moving his long Valyrian blonde hair from his face.

"I will go inform your arrival to Lord Matthias, immediately," the guard said, running off to go tell him of their arrival.

<TITLE> [Lore] The Lovely Lysandra (Part 1) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-27 22:54:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Aron had been in Lys for two months and he absolutely loved it! He loved the people, the food, the atmosphere, everything. But in the back of his mine, something was aching him "You're the heir Aron, you need to have children." He could hear his father's rough voice saying. He knew he had to had children, but knew he didn't want to have them with that Jordayne girl. She didn't seem interested and wasn't his type anyways. He thought he would try his luck at finding a wife in Lys, since all Lyseni women are absolutely beautiful, like his aunt Mysaria for example. It was said that in Lys, even the commoners had the typical Valyrian features: pale blonde hair, pale skin, and purple eyes. Aron didn't know who spread this rumor, but he found it to be true nonetheless. The city was filled with beautiful Valyrian looking women, he thought it had to have the most beautiful population in the world. *It won't be hard to find a woman here.* The city itself was admittedly filled with slaves, but other than that, it was quite beautiful, no wonder they called it Lys the Lovely. There was flowers of all kinds throughout the street, unlike in Dorne or Westeros in general. Everything seemed to be more colorful and lively, not as much as Tyrosh, but colorful and lively enough to see the difference.

As he walked down the cobblestone street, he saw a pillow house. Though they usually didn't do anything for him, he decided to go in, since everything in Lys was supposed to be lovely.

Boy was he wrong. The place reeked of booze and sweat and it was dark as a cave inside, he could barely see anything, he guessed that was a good thing. The sounds of moans and groans filled the pillow house and boy were they loud, nothing else could be heard besides the drunken murmurs of men telling the girls that they payed them enough and that they should shut and and do they're job. 

Gods, this place was hell, it was a terrible place, full of terrible people. As he was trying to leave, the brothel owner came up to him and said "Leaving so soon friend? You just go here?"

"There's nothing I like here," Aron said, pulling at the door once more.

"Nonsense, I'm sure we've something you like," the owner said, smiling as he put his hand on the door.

"Show me your most beautiful woman," he said, giving up on leaving.

"Oh, you're looking for Lovely Lysandra,"  the bald brothel owner smiled, gesturing to the back of the house.

<TEXT> It was dawn by the time they were ready to leave for Goldgrass. The horses had been feed and Ashara was packed, as far as she was concerned, that meant that it was time to go. She hugged her mother, Mysaria, and her newborn sister, Rhaenyra wishing them the best of luck. She could already see that Rhaenyra was going to look exactly like her mother, she already had the purple eyes after all. She hugged them both again, and gave Rhaenyra a kiss on the head.

"Come, Lady Ashara, you're father is waiting for you," the old knight said.

"Goodbye mother," Ashara said, with tears welling up in her eyes. 

"Goodbye Ashara," Mysaria said, at the point of crying. "Good luck with the Stout boy, I hope he's a good man."

  With that, Ashara left in silence, not saying another word to her mother. 

"Don't be sad Ashara, they'll come up for the wedding after all," he smiled.

'I know, but I'll miss everyone so much," she said, thinking of all of the good times she's had at Spottswood.

"It's not forever," he said, helping her climb onto her horse.

"I know it isn't, but everything will be so different the next time I see them. Nymella's gone, Visenya is gods know where, and Quentyn is at the Citadel, how many of them are going to be at Spottswood the next time I come down?" she asked.

"Well, the boys, your mother, and your newborn sister will be there, and uncle Aron," he said, climbing onto his horse.

"I guess that's better than nothing," she shrugged.

  With that, they were off to Goldgrass. </TEXT>

 My son, Jaehaerys arrived home today from your get together, as he was recalling events to everyone, it eventually led me to believe that he was being quite rude and racist. From the rest of House Santagar, we apologize profusely and pray to the gods that this will not ruin the budding relationship between our two great houses. I would like to assure you Lady Valena, not all of us are as rude and racist as my son, I truthfully do not know where he gets it from. But please my lady, if you will, do not let one bad apple spoil the bunch.

<TEXT> There was nothing wrong with Lady Jordayne, except that she was a woman of course. Aron knew that he wouldn't be able to do it, he wouldn't be able to marry and have kids with a woman, but he wanted children so badly. As he paced the halls of Spottswood, what if he ran away? What if he ran away where no one would find him? *Yes, it's perfect! I'm sorry girl.* He rode to Sunspear immediately and went to the docks.

"One ship to Lys," he said, rushed.

"We don't have any ships going to Lys," the old harbormaster said, scratching his white beard.

A moment later Aron pulled out a small velvet sack of coins and laid it on the harbormaster's desk. The old man looked at him perplexed, got up, and left. A moment later he came back with a captain. He was a plump man, looked mid forties with balding grey hair and he reeked of fish.

"This here is the captain who'll take you to Lys," the old man said, annoyed that he had to do actual work.

"Let's go," the plump captain said, licking grease off of his fingers.

*Ugh, this guy is disgusting, well, at least he isn't taking me far.*

The ship was a piece of junk. It was a small merchant ship that looked like it hadn't been taken good care of in at least a decade. Aron was hesitant of going on it, truth be told, but he just thought of spending the rest of his life with the Jordayne girl, and that made him immediately jump on.

Moments later he was sailing away from Dorne, the only home he had ever known. Back there, he was the heir of House Santagar, here, he was truthfully no one. It scared him to death to go to Lys. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Lord Lucerys Velaryon,

 I write to you today, my lord, asking if you would be interested in a betrothal for your daughter Della. My grandson, Selwyn, is seeking betrothal as well and I believe the two of them would make a great match. He is currently living with Princess Arianne and Serenei in King's Landing. If you are interested, my lord, I will send word to Selwyn informing him to go to Driftmark immediately.

 Yours Truly,

 Ser Aron Santagar, Knight of Spottswood

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Aron Santagar, the heir of Spottswood, had been riding for The Tor now for a day and a half. *Gods, is this sand unbearable.* He'd been called to The Tor by Lord Regent Auro Jordayne, however the Lord Regent did not give a reason for his call. Whatever it was, Aron hoped it wasn't a proposal. His father, Ser Aron had tried to set him up with a Stormlander about a decade back, but that didn't work. He refused and the marriage never took place. Aron often wondered what became of the Stormlander girl. *Did she mother a great lord? Did she marry a commoner or an heir?* Though he tried not to think of her often, as it caused him to feel a sort of guilt.

The Tor was absolutely beautiful when Aron got there. It had to be one of the nicest castles he'd ever seen in his opinion. Near the front gate, there were two huge guards, as big as the Red Mountains they were. 

"State your business," the guard on the left said, getting in front of the door.

"I wish to speak to Lord Regent Auro Jordayne. He's called me here. I am Aron Santagar, heir to Spottswood," Aron said, pumping out his chest. For some reason, knowing he was the heir made him feel quite well.

A moment later, the guard went into the castle to get Auro Jordayne. </TEXT>

She's always tells other people that I've no job and that I've been out of hs for two years and haven't gone to college yet, am not doing anything with my life, am like my dad, etc. 1) I don't have a job because one, it's difficult to get a job when you have no qualifications and two, I CAN'T FUCKING DRIVE. How the fuck are you supposed to get a job when you can't drive!?! I don't want to force people to drive me like my dad did because that causes resentment. Also, how am I supposed to go to college? I've no money and don't know what to study, and I'm definitely not falling in that debt trap.
2) I'm not doing anything with my life because I don't know what to do damn! Plus do you know how fucking hard it is to do ANYTHING with fucking depression?! DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE!
3) This one is the worst one imaginable. My dad is a conman, a manipulator, a liar, a thief, and an abuser. THIS IS A MAN, WHO RECENTLY TRIED TO FAKE HIS DEATH BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT AND WHO ALMOST PUSHED HER OUT OF A WINDOW and she says I'm like him because I don't do anything. You know, it's hard as hell to do anything if you got depression, and you ain't helping! I even tried to call her out on this when she last told me I was like him, I said "do I hit you?" She didn't say a word. I love her, but damn, she needs to shut the fuck up. So, what do I do now? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nymella was still in shock that she was married to Baelor Hightower, *I married a Hightower of Oldtown*

"Are you ok, Nymella?" Quentyn asked, knocking her out of her trance.

"Yes, father, I'm fine," she smiled.

"Then cheer up darling, you just got married after all! It's going to be wonderful living in Oldtown," Oberyn smiled, his laugh lines becoming more apparent.

"I know it will be father, I am just nervous that's all. What if Lord Humfrey and Lady Alaena don't approve of me?"

"Nonesense, you're a a smart girl and quite beautiful, I might add, why wouldn't they?"

"You saw the way everyone was at me. They couldn't believe that Baelor, a Hightower, was marrying a me, a lady from a minor Dornish house."

"Well then, you've got to prove to them that that's not all you are. Did you marry above yourself, absolutely you did, Nymella but don't let the whispers of people in the sept control how you live the rest of your life. I'm sure, once they get to know you, they'll love you almost as much as I do," he said, giving her a hug. "I'm afraid I must be going, I've got to get back to Spottswood immediately and then it's on to King's Landing."

"Why are you going there?" she asked.

"Apparently, your sister Visenya said that Prince Lucky could have a leopard and that I would stay down there for a while and train it. I guess it's worth it, now that we've high favor with the little prince," he chuckled.

"Be safe, father," she with tears building up in her eyes.

She realized, that after he father left, she would have no one in Oldtown that she knew well; all of the other Santagars were on their way home.

"Be safe too, Nymella," he smiled again.

And with that, he got into the carriage, and he was gone. *Let's hope I make a few friends here, and fast.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was young, I was a voracious reader, I even read in classes I thought were boring at school, I used to read all of the time. Then when I graduated, I fell into a bout of depression, it wasn't all at once. But I noticed I stopped doing things, lost interest in reading, and, I'm sure you guys know the rest. Fast forward to 2016 and I want to read *so fucking bad.* I've currently been trying to read Game of Thrones but I find, I can't comprehend anything. It's not with just that book either, it's with most things I try to read. What did you guys do to combat this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nymella looked up at the Starry Sept and she couldn't fathom how big it was. *My gods, it's huge.* She couldn't believe it, tomorrow she would be a married woman. *What if he doesn't like me? Nonsense, of course he would.* Even though she was quite nervous for tomorrow, she couldn't help but think of what life would be like in the tower and what her future children would look like. A moment later, she was greeted by someone behind her.

<TEXT> Visenya could always feel his stars, and sometimes she'd even catch him in the act, which made her quite nervous. She didn't ask him to stop because, truth be told, she liked this one. She found herself starring at him more and more often now, though, she made sure she was very subtle about it, so doubtful he'd know. Though, she was sure that he caught a few, but definitely not all. 

During the trip to Rivierrun, she couldn't help but notice how much of a man he was becoming, and a good looking one at that. He didn't seem as rough as the other northmen, which she liked.

"Thank you Damian," she blushed. "You don't look too bad yourself."

<TEXT> Ok, I don't know if it's called that, but you guys should know what I'm talking about (I think?).

How can you tell if your dealing with a preposition that takes its noun in the accusative rather than the ablative? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Lore] Arrival at King's Landing </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-16 17:24:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "*We've finally arrived in King's Landing*," Selwyn thought.

"Little lord, we're here," said the fat carriage driver.


  King's Landing was absolutely beautiful, and high atop the hill was the Red Keep, as red and huge as ever. The city itself seemed as though it went on for miles, he looked as far as he could, and it didn't end. He wondered how big it could be. It was a loud city, quieter than the outskirts of Dorne, that's for sure, he wondered if he'd like it here. Then again, he would get to meet the two princesses, and maybe if he was lucky, the future king? Or maybe the greatest knight who ever lived, Ser Arthur Dayne?

 It seemed to take forever to get to the Red Keep and the way there was not as pleasant as Selwyn would have liked, so he closed his eyes until he got to the keep.

"Where do I go now?" Selwyn said, as he got out of the carriage.

"I would best go the Princess herself little lord," Martyn said, wiping the sweat from his forehead with a cloth.

"Martyn, would you accompany me to the gate?" Selwyn asked, a little nervous to be in King's Landing.

"Sure," Martyn smiled. 

  The Red Keep was much bigger than Selwyn ever dreamed of, he tried to lift his head up as far as possible, but even then, he didn't see the top of the keep.

"Get out of here," one of the guardsman said, pointing his sword at the slums.

"This is young Selwyn Santagar, grandson of Ser Aron Santagar," Martyn said, walking towards the guard.

"Do you have any business here?" the guard said, with a hint of anger in his voice.

"Yes, just ask Princess Arianne," Martyn said.

"Fine," he said, going into the Red Keep. "Keep an eye on these two." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Santagars sat down at the table, talking amongst themselves. The girls about how cute the contestants look, and the men about the events.

"It's a shame that Ser Arthur Dayne didn't come, he's quite cute," Rhaella whispered in her sister's ear.

"He's not. The Hellknight is," Visenya said, looking towards him.

"He's an oaf Visenya," Rhaella chuckled.

"No he's not!" Visenya yelled.

<TEXT> They'd never been anywhere out of Dorne before, when they go to walk the streets of Oldtown, Rhaegar and Rhaego Sand were absolutely amazed, the fabled city of Oldtown was astonishingly beautiful. The smell of fresh bread and the sound of people talking filled the air. It was a beautiful day. 

"Isn't Oldtown wonderful?" Rhaegar said, moving the long pale blonde hair out of his eyes.

"Eh, it's ok. Can't believe I lost," Rheago said.

"Winning isn't everything brother," Rheagar said. "What a great city Oldtown is."

"Why don't you move here then?" Rheago said, agitated.

"I don't think I could, I'd miss all the Dornish girls," Rhaegar chuckled.

"You've never even been with a woman," Rheago said, trying to avoid the mud that was on the street.

"Maybe not, but nonetheless, they do look more beautiful than any other girls in the Seven Kingdoms," Rhaegar said chuckled.

They finally reached the Seven Shrines, it was as big and as magnificent just as Rhaegar had imagined.

"Why the hell are we here?" Rhaego said, looking at the shrines.

"To worship the gods of course, " Rhaegar said, looking at the shrines too.

"Fuck the gods, their cunts. I prayed and prayed to win this match and they didn't give me a win," Rhaego said, spitting at the shrines.

"You can't do that here! This isn't Spottswood where you can call the gods cunts all you like, you're at a shrine, show some respect," Rhaegar whispered, trying not to start a scene.

"Fine. Now if you excuse me, I'm going to find a whorehouse," Rhaego said, walking away.

"But you've no money," Rhaegar yelled.

Rhaego left without saying another word to him.

"Might we see Quentyn?" Rhealla asked.

"Doubtful, he's at the Citadel" Ser Aron said, walking into the festival.

"Maybe we should visit," Oberyn insisted.

"If we've time, sure. I'd like to socialize first though brother," Ser Aron said walking towards the nearest crowd.

"Aron and his socializing, hasn't changed a bit," Oberyn chuckled. </TEXT>

"Please tell father said goodbye," Selwyn said, moving his dark hair from his eyes.

"I will," Ser Aron said. "Do you have all of your books?"

"Yes, grandfather, I have them all," Selwyn smiled.

"Umm, my lord, I believe we should be going now, we've got a long day ahead of us," the fat solider said.

"I believe he's right Selwyn," he said,trying to help the boy onto the horse.

"Now Selwyn, be a good for Princess Arianne all right? Same goes for little Princess Serenei," Ser Aron said. "Please send my regards to both."

"Yes, grandfather," Selwyn chuckled.

"Now you best be off!" Ser Aron said, a moment later the whip sounded, and there they went.

"Will we ever see Selwyn again? King's Landing is a dangerous place, Aron," Madelyn said, with tears in her eyes.

"We'll see Selwyn again, I'm sure of it. He's a smart boy, he knows how to protect himself. And who knows, maybe he'll practice fighting with the great Arthur Dayne" Ser Aron said, not sure himself if he'll ever see Selwyn again.  </TEXT>

"Because uncle, I love those old dusty books, and history, and healing people," Quentyn said, packing his things up. 

"Why not go hunting? You'll love it," Lorence refilled his goblet 

"I don't. Father took me when I was 15, it was terrible," Quentyn said, grabbing the wine on the table. "However, this, this is wonderful."

"Well, at least you like drinking," his uncle chuckled

"I am a man after all uncle," Quentyn chuckled. 

   Quentyn took a huge sip of wine and grabbed his bag.

"That's all you're taking?" Lorence said, shocked.

"It's all I need. Until then, uncle," the boy waved while walking out of the room.

 After the boy left, the room was dead silent except for the sound of spilling wine.

Drinking the spiced Dornish wine, Ser Lorence muttered "Gods I'm gonna miss that boy."

After, he drank in silence for a long while and feel asleep. </TEXT>

Forget about it. What can I do to get more matches? If your answer is "have a lot of money, have a big dick, and be handsomer" don't bother commenting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm come to the conclusion that my ancestor, Bertha Stanley Dudley and her siblings, were illegitimate. Their father is listed as David Dudley on most of their vital records, yet I have no proof that a David Dudley lived with their mother Virginia, other than her father. Is it possible that Bertha's mother Maggie put her father's name on all of her children's records? The man I think might be her children's father is named J.M. Green who is about 52 in the 1900 and is living with his son Norman, Maggie, and her three children. Even though he's about 22 years older than her, is it possible that he's the father of these three Dudley girls? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't go see anyone, we don't have enough money. Sometimes I feel like I have regular depression then it goes away and I feel great.

When I am in a depressive state, I feel worthless and can't do anything. I've heard that bipolar runs in families, my granddad was an alcoholic, could that me he was bipolar and passed it on to me? </TEXT>

My dad is an abusive asshole who only cares about himself and forced me to play sports and yelled at me when I complained. I have no friends currently, I just sit alone in my house all day and can't drive because I was born premature and people always made fun of me when I was a kid. I really never had more than 5 friends in my entire life, they were just people I talked to. Not to mention the girl I care deeply for hates my guts, well I don't know about hate but she definitely doesn't care about me the way I care about her maybe cause I came on too fast, but that's only cause I really like her, she lives across the street. And now I'm 20 with no job (except a volunteer one), no lady, and no friends. My self esteem/confidence is non existent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off: no, I'm not suicidal, I'm too much of a coward, I have thought about it though. Anyways, let's begin. Everything was fine when I was in high school, then graduation came, everyone was going off and they knew what they were doing, and I stayed home all day. I can't drive (eye problems), the girl I love dearly thinks I'm a creep (I have a tendency of coming on to strong), everyone's moving on, and time is passing every second (I know you can't give advice about that XD.) Naturally, with all of these problems, I was diagnosed with depression. On top of that, I have no friends. My life sucks. If I wasn't so afraid of death and a coward about killing myself, I'd do it. Honestly, I see no point in living. Also, I can't go to college because I'm poor. Life sucks.

They aren't even singing about anything, what gives?

  The huge crowd looked dead at me, it was so silent you could hear a pin drop.

"What are you all gathering around for?" I asked the guard.

"An execution of course," he gave a sinister smile. "You're next."

"Why am I next, I didn't even do anything!" I yelled.

"Because you arrive out of nowhere with a strange blue box, that is suspicious" he said after he spat on the ground.

"i swear to you, I mean no harm," I said putting my hands above my head.

"Yeah? That's what they all say. Come here." he said grabbing me by the collar on my jacket.

"I'm innocent, I swear!" I yelled but no one was listening.

I looked ahead and saw an old wooden platform above it was a rope.

So this is how I am going to die, by hanging during the French Revolution. 

"Get up there!" the guard shoved me.

   Looking out at the crowd, I saw the crazed people yelling and shouting "hang him!" "kill him already!" Then, out of nowhere, the guard said something: "EXTERMINATE." Daleks. </TEXT>

EDIT: what I mean is do you like a stricter word order like SVO, SOV, etc. Or do you like a freer word order like Latin for example. </TEXT>

* Do readers like in depth worlds?

So far I've really gotten into the history and lore of the world. I would imagine this helps the world seem more realistic. I plan to add even more though because I enjoy doing it.

<TITLE> Did anyone else not enjoy the Hobbit movies? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-16 06:49:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> WARNING: This post will be somewhat long.
Now that we got that out of the way, did anyone else not enjoy The Hobbit movies? Don't get me wrong, I'm a Tolkien fan. Let's start from the beginning. When I was a preteen, I LOVED the Hobbit and was completely enthralled by Middle Earth. After I finished The Hobbit, I checked out LOTR. LOTR was a little harder to read and a lot darker, but I got threw them and enjoyed them thoroughly. When I discovered the movies, I watched the hell out of them and loved them. So when I found out that the Hobbit was coming out, I was like: HELL YES, FINALLY! However, I couldn't even make it through the first hour of the movie, it was just WAY to slow. I always didn't like how they added stuff from LOTR, I thought that took the "feeling " of the Hobbit away. I didn't like how they cut the Hobbit (WHICH IS A SMALL BOOK) into three boring parts. It probably would've worked (and been better) as a standalone movie. Sorry about my ramblings at the end. The point is, am I the only one that feels like this?

***EDIT*** I just watched it a couple of minutes ago for the first time. I know, I'm late. How were the last two? I ask because I don't plan to watch them. I don't even plan to finish the first one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom always tells me to "be more social" and to "get out of the house more." The problem is, it's exhausting to be social. If I have to be anymore social, I'm going to go crazy. Now since "I don't socialize enough" she's having me go talk to a psychologist. Is there actually something wrong with me? How do I convince my mother that I believe I introverted?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've just started watching "Doctor Who" a couple of days ago and I love it! I'm already on season/series two! However, my friend has told me some bad news. He told me that the one episode adventures end and get replaced with a season/series long adventure with more filler episodes? Is this true? Please someone tell me it isn't. When does this change happen? </TEXT>

Another question: Why do some black folks love Africa and their people so much if they sold their ancestors out? This isn't meant to be racist, I'm being very serious here. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Why are non rhotic accents dying out in the South? For example, my grandfather had a one hundred percent non rhotic accent and was born in Northern Virginia (Winchester to be precise.) I was born in Northern Virginia as well (about fifty miles  away from Winchester) and I have a non rhotic accent too. Though, not many other people do around here. Why is this accent dying out?

Examples of a non rhotic accent:

"River" is pronounced "Rivuh" 
"Spider" is pronounced "spiduh"
"Winchester" is pronounced "Winchestuh

This isn't homework, I'm genuinely fascinated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> he Reds

     The Reds are a vicious and violent group. They kill and attack anyone and everyone. They are easily spotted by their bandannas soaked in their enemies blood (thus they are called the Reds.) Because their bandannas arent naturally red, they have to kill often to keep their bandannas red. They come from the South. They arent a race per se, theyre more of a gang.

I mean, [look at these guys!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opji5DgE_nQ) They are indie and they made a great live action rendition! There's got to be someone out there who can do these series justice. If we do get a Dragon Ball movie, I personally think it should be at least a trilogy because there's just too much to stuff into one movie. What do you think? </TEXT>

By the way she posts when I do. THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE, IT'S HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES. When I post, she posts. She also only posts the amount of pictures I post. So if I only posted one, she only posts one.

2. How many Danes settled in Normandy? Were these the same people who accompanied Rollo in 911?
3. How quickly did the Norse intermarry and assimilate with the Gallo-Romans? Did they move their families from Scandinavia?
4. Did the Normans feel kinship between the Norse\Vikings\Danes?
5. How long did Old Norse last in Normandy? Did the aristocricy attempt to learn Old Norse.
6. Did the Scandinavians have any cultural impact on the natives?
7. How did the Franks feel about the settlers? 
8. Aren't all Normans "Vikings" since the word comes from "Vikingr" which means "to go raiding". The Normans did plenty of that.
9. Did the Normans feel different from the native Frankish\Gallo-Roman population? 

Sorry if this is a lot of questions, I'm just fascinated by the Normans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I'd like to point out that my grammar isn't the greatest. That being said, I believe it's fairly accurate. If my grammar is not accurate, POLITELY tell me what I've done wrong so I don't make those mistakes again. With that being said, let's get on to the rant. I don't understand why people do not use correct grammar and spelling. One: YOU HAVE AUTO-CORRECT (although, it does not catch some grammar mistakes). Two: Don't these people who use incorrect grammar and spelling know that if you write correctly it eases communication? I believe laziness has something to do with it. I mean, how difficult is it to write "you" instead "u"? I'm baffled by this sudden urge to use incorrect grammar and spelling. Although, maybe it's just pure ignorance. Anyways, this concludes the end of my rant. I apologize for it's length; I'm just very passionate about English. Is there anyone else out there who agrees with me? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently in the process of learning French. All though I'd love to go to France, that's not the main reason I'm learning the language. I'm learning the language because I find it very fascinating; It's a great mix of the Celtic language of Gaul and Latin (If that is incorrect, please pardon me) and I haven't seen a Romance language like it. I know this is long, please bear with me. Now to the question: When I visit France one day, will the natives be mad when I pronounce French bad? Not on purpose of course. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-22 14:38:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For example: English lost it's grammatical gender cases, declensions died out, and English adjectives never change. They change in other Germanic languages and all Romance and Slavic languages. I've even heard some people say that English is "a string of words put together". More example: we have a huge lack of morphology, Nothing connects words in English. We also have a written alphabet that compares no correlation to how it sounds, and a system of spelling that Dan Brown couldn't decipher. Albeit, those last two didn't have much to do with grammar, I just wanted to point them out.

EDIT: Sorry about the punctuation error in the tittle, I was in a hurry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some southerners have been speaking badly about my native Virginia. These folks say things along the lines of "Virginia's not the South" why do these folks say that. I mean, Virginia is the birthplace of Southern culture. Sweet tea was made out of a recipe book called "Recipes from Old Virginia", a lot of our prestigious confederate generals are from Virginia, and we had the first thanksgiving. Now Virginia might not be in the Deep south, but she's still Southern. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The tumultuous waves crashed into the Caribbean-esque shores. With them, me. I stood up on the white sanded beach and looked out into the great blue yonder. The water was so blue and clear, I could've sworn I was in the Bahamas. A moment later, I smelled iron. "Blood" I thought. I ripped off my white cotton dress shirt and saw the the blood oozing out of the deep lacerations on my torso. Then, the smelled of something being grilled filled the air. "There's someone else on the island. I ran to the smell as fast as humanly possible. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done. I ran so fast my muscles started to hurt. I tripped over rocks and branches multiple times which exacerbated the lacerations. When I got to the barbecue all I saw were servants and a woman in a red dress. She was no older than me, twenty. After looking around, I collapsed. The next thing I remember, I was in a huge cave. Except, it didn't look like a cave. It looked like a regular home. I opened my eyes and saw the immaculate kitchen, it was like one you'd see in a five star restaurant. Annexed off the kitchen, there was a beautiful dining room. However, I got the feeling that it was just collecting dust. I was laying on a black couch big enough for two people and was snuggled up in a flannel blanket. I wanted to get up but I debated if it was worth losing the warmth. It was decided, I'd get up. As I got up, I heard a woman say "Woah, easy there". She was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was like something out of a Greek mythology tale. She had long dark brown hair braided to the side, warm brown eyes, and smelled like honeysuckle. She looked very Mediterranean. For example, she had olive skin and strong facial features. Her voice was soft and when she talked, it sounded like angles were singing. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she was Aphrodite. "What's your name," I asked. "I am Calypso and you are on Ogygia" she smiled. "After we eat, you can go home if you'd like". "Can I think about it" I said looking at the island. "Sure," she smiled. "Now go back to sleep, you need rest". A moment later, my eyes were closed.
                *****
When I opened my eyes, I saw her smiling over me, her teeth were pure white. How could I leave her? "It's time for dinner" she said playing with my hair. When we walked out of the cave, it was night. How long was I asleep for? The only source of light were the stars and the moon. Since there was no light pollution, you could see the faintest stars. It was beautiful. On the white beach there was a blanket and several baskets. "It's a beautiful out here. Is it like this every night?" I said looking up at the stars. "Yes it is " she smiled while looking up at the stars. The baskets had everything in them. Literally, you could think of food or drink and you'd have it. After dinner, we walked on the shores. "Will you stay with me?" She asked. I could hear a hint of nervousness in her voice. I thought about my life in the real world. I had no family, no friends, and no money. I had nothing. Why wouldn't I stay with her? "Of course I'll stay with you" I said leaning in to kiss her.

I hope this wasn't that bad. I'm pretty rusty. Please don't be to mean. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok guys I think this girl likes me. When I was at high school I knew she liked me but I graduated. She lives across the street. Whenever I do anything on social media she does. Let's take today for instance. I changed my picture on instagram to me in a st. Party's day themed hat. Then when I check her profile, she changed her picture. And whenever I see her out of my window, she always has a blank look on her face. What does this mean?
1) Sat next to me.
2)Looked at me. (In the mirror on the bus and when we weren't on the bus). When I'd look at her back she'd turn away.
3)Played with hair etc.
4) Talked in a really soft voice. I had no headphones on and I could barely hear her.
5)Always wanted to be where I was. I'd post something on Facebook and she'd be like "I wish I was there".
6)She always talked to this guy ONLY when I was around and it pissses me off! If there any girls around please tell me what the hell this about!
7) Only posts on social media when I post something. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. I post a picture on instagram, she posts one.
8)When I was walking around the halls before class, she followed me. Naturally because I'm extremely shy I kept running away. She finally just went to class.

TR;DR: Does she like me?

P.S. She's now 18 and in high school. I (a guy) am 19 in college. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do some Brits hate and make fun of Americans? I'm an American with English ancestry and I think England is pretty cool. I haven't been there but I'd love to! They always say that we're ruining English. I mean, I know we talk and write differently but you don't have to go that far. I've also heard some Brits on here say "Americans think they invented the language". I don't. I know the history of English. It makes me sad to hear my cousins across the pond make fun of me and my fellow Americans (although there are some Americans who make fun of Brits and do deserve this. I am not one of them though). My question is, why do some Brits make fun of Americans? I'm not trying to troll or anything like that this is a serious question. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [FN, RO] Ogygia (Oh-gee-gee-ah) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-27 17:22:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>    The tumultuous waves crashed into the Caribbean-esque shores. With them, me. I stood up on the white sanded beach and looked out into the great blue yonder. The water was so blue and clear, I could've sworn I was in the Bahamas. A moment later, I smelled iron. "Blood" I thought. I ripped off my white cotton dress shirt and saw the the blood oozing out of the deep lacerations on my torso. Then, the smelled of something being grilled filled the air. "There's someone else on the island.
   I ran to the smell as fast as humanly possible. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done. I ran so fast my muscles started to hurt. I tripped over rocks and branches multiple times which exacerbated the lacerations. When I got to the barbecue all I saw were servants and a woman in a red dress. She was no older than me, twenty. After looking around, I collapsed.
   The next thing I remember, I was in a huge cave. Except, it didn't look like a cave. It looked like a regular home. I opened my eyes and saw the immaculate kitchen, it was like one you'd see in a five star restaurant. Annexed off the kitchen, there was a beautiful dining room. However, I got the feeling that it was just collecting dust. I was laying on a black couch big enough for two people and was snuggled up in a flannel blanket. I wanted to get up but I debated if it was worth losing the warmth. It was decided, I'd get up. As I got up, I heard a woman say "Woah, easy there".
   She was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was like something out of a Greek mythology tale. She had long dark brown hair braided to the side, warm brown eyes, and smelled like honeysuckle. She looked very Mediterranean. For example, she had olive skin and strong facial features. Her voice was soft and when she talked, it sounded like angles were singing. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she was Aphrodite.
     "What's your name," I asked.
     "I am Calypso and you are on Ogygia" she smiled. "After we eat, you can go home if you'd like".
     "Can I think about it" I said looking at the island.
     "Sure," she smiled. "Now go back to sleep, you need rest".
     A moment later, my eyes were closed.
     
                    *****
  When I opened my eyes, I saw her smiling over me, her teeth were pure white. How could I leave her?
  "It's time for dinner" she said playing with my hair.
   When we walked out of the cave, it was night. How long was I asleep for? The only source of light were the stars and the moon. Since there was no light pollution, you could see the faintest stars. It was beautiful. On the white beach there was a blanket and several baskets.
    "It's a beautiful out here. Is it like this every night?" I said looking up at the stars.
    "Yes it is " she smiled while looking up at the stars.
    The baskets had everything in them. Literally, you could think of food or drink and you'd have it. After dinner, we walked on the shores.
   "Will you stay with me?" She asked. I could hear a hint of nervousness in her voice.
   I thought about my life in the real world. I had no family, no friends, and no money. I had nothing. Why wouldn't I stay with her?
  "Of course I'll stay with you" I said leaning in to kiss her.


I hope this wasn't that bad. I'm pretty rusty. Please don't be to mean.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone, I was wondering, am I a country boy? I mean, I ask because this girl I like said I was a fake. I was born and raised in the suburbs (I HATE IT HERE!) and don't care too much for the city either. The reason I'm not living out there is because I'm a teen and still live with my parents. I don't hunt or fish (no one ever took me) and don't drink beer (I have members in my family who drank and I didn't like what it did to them, that turned me off to alcohol). I LOVE country music, I've been listening to it since I came out of my mother (no seriously, it was the music I listened to on the first car ride home). I do like camo and the only music I listen to is country. I also enjoy fixing things with my hands. So am I a country boy? I'm 18 and a guy. She's the 17 and a girl.

**tl;dr**: I'm just asking if I'm a country boy because a girl I like said I wasn't. </TEXT>
