<TEXT> From the source: 

 "The Tooth Worm as Hell's Demon" - 18th century. Carved from ivory and standing only 4 inches tall, the two halves open up to reveal a scene about the infernal torments of a toothache which people believed caused cavities in the past. Complete with mini skulls, hellfire, and naked people wielding clubs. Tooth worms have a long history, first appearing in a Sumerian text around 5,000 BC. References to tooth worms can be found in China, Egypt and India long before the belief finally takes root (pun intended) into Western Europe in the 8th century.

<TEXT> Yep, 10 is the cap for collecting. I get being a couple over, maybe 15, for insurance, but anything over that and you're just preventing others from collecting as well. Again though, if you got the high level mons to throw on there and you're the one beating the opposing teams gyms and/or leveling up your own it's hard to say don't throw yours on there. </TEXT>

I just don't see the point, other than personal pride, of being in more than 15 or so gyms as insurance. He's obviously good at what he does though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get what you're saying, but I think resetting the gyms isn't the right way. Capping how many some folks can be in gyms will help, maybe even minimizing how much a gym can grow to, from 10 to 7, will help because it wont be such a process to take down. Don't get me wrong, I'm not in a crazy ton of gyms, I average maybe 3-5 and it's a real struggle in my area because all three teams are fairly even. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you tell me who banned me for 30 days for posting [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/natureismetal/comments/5wha66/fishing_mishap/)?

The rule on the side states:

 This is not a sub to post content with humans. If a person is the main subject of your post it will be removed.

I would say that the dinosaur snatching away a fish is the main subject of the post. I tried to reason with the mod who banned me but was told to just read the sidebar. I feel like I've been a pretty steady contributor and to get 30 days for that was a bit much. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about listening to YouTube while phone is in sleep mode </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-05 23:35:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! So I like to listen to some YouTube compilations on my phone while it's asleep. Usually I would, using safari, find the YouTube video, hit play, put the phone to sleep, hit the home button, and hit the play button and put it back to sleep and never have a problem. Over the weekend I tried to do this but when I hit play after putting it to sleep, it would go into Music mode and play songs stored on the phone. Did I do something in my setting to make this happen? Is there a work around? Will the YouTube app work while the phone is in sleep mode? The things I'm listening to have nothing visual to them but are just old Howard Stern radio shows.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't believe so. The video comes from https://www.latestsightings.com/. My understanding is that this is an organization that has cams setup throughout the nature park to capture these types of things and probably ensure nothing illegal is taking place in the park. These are all filmed in [Kruger National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruger_National_Park), which does have tourist lodging and provide safaris. According to Wikipedia, **"The park was initially created to control hunting and protect the diminished number of animals in the park."* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dan's been on at least once that I remember, right around the time the Big Three came to Miami. Simmons and Lebatard likened the whole situation to that of the 1980's Scarface movie. A listener of that pod ended up making [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n7LWlLOrNk). If you read the description, he writes:

 What happens when you combine Scarface with the Miami Heat? Now you know. There are many guest appearances, so watch closely! I was looking to have some fun with the Miami Heat situation. I finally landed on an idea when I heard Bill Simmons and Dan LeBatard compare the Miami Heat to Scarface. I couldn't pass it up.

Bill and Dan also cohosted PTI a handful of times, and Bill was in studio for an entire show of Lebatards. Bill was a semi-frequent caller into Dan's show. Dan nicknamed Bill the Body Language Oracle which Bill eventually turned into Body Language Doctor. Oracle is much, much funnier, IMO.

Edit: [here's the archive of Bill sitting in during one of Lebatards radio shows from a few years back](https://www.reddit.com/r/billsimmons/comments/59brgm/from_2014_bill_simmons_on_the_lebatard_show/)

Edit 2: they were also on that special pre Lebron's The Decision with Uncle Tony and Mike Wilbon discussing possible destinations for LeBron. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just an incredible looking creature. From the source:

natgeo: video by @joelsartore | A southern three-banded armadillo at the @LincolnChildrensZoo in Nebraska. 
This is one of only two species of armadillo with the ability to roll up into a complete ball as a defense mechanism. The southern three-banded armadillo is listed as near threatened on the IUCN red list, meaning although it doesnt qualify for a threatened status right now, it is close to qualifying for, or is likely to qualify for one in the near future. One major factor in the decline of to the southern three-banded armadillo is hunting. Since they are not fossorial (adapted to living underground), this species is easier to hunt than other armadillos. Habitat loss as well as the high mortality rate during exportation into the pet trade are also significant threats to this species.

We have kids, so on the weekends I don't have them, I go in, help clean up some of the animal pens, walk the perimeter to make sure the fence is secure (we have 5 deer in a 5-6 acre plot of land), get their food ready, etc. We have some hawks and owls, and the center is used by schools for educational stuff, so I'll start training with handling them in the next few weeks. All in all, it takes up most of my Saturday. Other than that, benders and closing bars down. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree for the most part but as with anything, there are bad people out there. I volunteer at a nature center down here in Florida and we have 5 deer currently in a fenced in compound, about 5-6 acres total. Two years ago a couple of "hunters" broke in and took out 2 of the deer who obviously weren't able to freely flee. They didn't take the carcasses, didn't take any meat, just shot 'em and left 'em. Again though, for the most part, I think you're absolutely right. </TEXT>

I'm a Hispanic American and never, ever felt any type of weirdness from the folks who lived in the state and neither did any of my other servicemen who weren't "*white*". It's a shame they're having to deal with this psycho. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Horror master...*

I am looking forward to this. My love for horror stems from the fear the original series gave me. I still remember hiding in my room while my dad watched it in the living room. The original song and then the laugh. Too much for me to handle at 10, but I 
grew to love the series as a I got older.

<TEXT> Just discovered the sub and love the theme. I had posted this in r/creepy a while back and didn't see it in here.

Anyhow, from the Wikipedia page for John of Leiden, one of the men tortured and killed:

 The army of Mnster was defeated in 1535 by the prince-bishop Franz von Waldeck, and John of Leiden was captured. He was found in the cellar of a house, from where he was taken to a dungeon in Dlmen, then brought back to Mnster. On January 22, 1536, along with Bernhard Krechting and Bernhard Knipperdolling, he was tortured and then executed. Each of the three was attached to a pole by an iron spiked collar and his body ripped with red-hot tongs for the space of an hour. After Knipperdolling saw the process of torturing John of Leiden, he attempted to kill himself with the collar, using it to choke himself. After that the executioner tied him to the stake to make it impossible for him to kill himself. After the burning, their tongues were pulled out with tongs before each was killed with a burning dagger thrust through the heart. The bodies were placed in three iron baskets and hung from the steeple of St. Lambert's Church and the remains left to rot. About fifty years later the bones were removed, but the baskets remain.

Dan Carlin did a podcast on this entire subject called Prophets of Doom. If you have 4 hours to spare, it's worth a listen. Available on iTunes and [here](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-48-prophets-of-doom/)

I wanted to catch our first Porygon with my son over the weekend but none were showing up close to home. I broke down and drove the 20 minutes during lunch and caught four in 15 minutes. All had shitty IVs, the best one being a 60ish% one with a cp of 20, but I'm happy to have finally checked this off my list. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a noob, so downvote away, but in my area, all the gyms are stacked with Snorlax's, Lapras', Vaporeons, Rhydons and Dragonites. I think their should be a cap on how many of those can be in each gym, forcing people to have to use different mons. It would give it a Mortal Kombat vibe if there are 10 different types of mons to go through instead of the same 5. Just my two bad cents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi!

So I listen to a lot of podcasts and I try to utilize the Up Next option to setup a playlist. I've noticed a couple of times that, lets say, when Joe Rogan uploads a new podcast, all of his other ones that I haven't listened to yet, will populate in a Resume Playing category under the Up Next one. What did I do and how do I undo it? It's come to a point where I've clicked an episode that I don't subscribe to, hit the Clear Next option, and then go back through mine an add the ones I want in Up Next to undo the long list of ones I don't want to listen to yet.

Sorry this sounded confusing.

<TEXT> Hola,

Firstly, I am loving this series. The Drawing of the Three started a little slow for me and it became a bit of a chore but once the Leaning Tower *event* took place I got hooked and when Detta made her appearance I became all in. Anyhow, I'm about to finish it and I went to reserve the Wastelands but I want to make sure I'm getting the right thing. 

Through the library, it's listed with the following info:


Title:  The waste lands / Stephen King ; illustrated by Ned Dameron.

Author:  King, Stephen, 1947-

ISBN:  9780452284715 9780670032563 9780451210869

Author:  King, Stephen, 1947-

Edition:  Plume new ed.

Publisher:  Plume : Penguin Group (USA),

Publication Information:  New York : Plume : Penguin Group (USA), c2003.

Publication Date:  2003

Physical Description:  xvi, 422 p., [22] p. of plates : ill. (some col.) ; 23 cm.

Series:  

Dark tower novel ; bk. 3

Dark tower;



I guess what I'm trying to confirm is that this is not a graphic novel but the actual novel. Thanks in advance.

edit: formatting </TEXT>

I was really, really nervous about how she was going to take being away from mom a couple of days a week. She wakes me up every day and we snuggle together before the day gets going. Through all of this our relationship has gotten much stronger. I love my boy with all of my heart but there is something to be said about the connection a father can have with his little girl. I feel like I could move a mountain if she needed me to. </TEXT>

I hope your daughter and your little ones get to a place where they can kind of tune her out and not allow her to effect them at a deeper level. They're fortunate to have a good dad who obviously has their best interest at heart. Once all is set and done you should maybe take them on a vacation. </TEXT>

As far as playing the victim, you have these tapes. You have the evidence that is not a victim, so I don't think you would lose your children. Does she really want them around? She sounds like a miserable person who cant be bothered to be a parent. Would she be open to you increasing your % of custody? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The day me and my ex started telling our family that we were pregnant she started to spot. We ended up going to the ER where after 8 hours one of the nurses told us that we were so early in our pregnancy that there really wasn't anything that could be done. I remember us crying to sleep that night. I remember the voicemail my mom left me (I notified her by sending her a silly e-card where a stork is flying and it said something like delivery date tbd, just something out of the norm, kind of like the relationship we share) where she said "Hey, got your email. I'm not sure what this means... are you guys pregnant" and her voice cracked because of how happy she was. We happened to have her OB doctors appointment the next day anyway and he did the ultrasound. There he/she was, floating around with a "blood bubble" next to him/her. The doc said "oh boy, I don't like that." Told us to take it easy, not necessarily bed rest easy, but no heavy lifting for a week and then come back for another ultrasound. I'm happy to say our son is 8 years now and full of life.

Be positive OP, I wish and pray the best for you and your wife. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, from the Wikipedia page for John of Leiden, one of the men tortured and killed, a little more detail into what happened to the three men:

The army of Mnster was defeated in 1535 by the prince-bishop Franz von Waldeck, and John of Leiden was captured. He was found in the cellar of a house, from where he was taken to a dungeon in Dlmen, then brought back to Mnster. On January 22, 1536, along with Bernhard Krechting and Bernhard Knipperdolling, he was tortured and then executed. Each of the three was attached to a pole by an iron spiked collar and his body ripped with red-hot tongs for the space of an hour. After Knipperdolling saw the process of torturing John of Leiden, he attempted to kill himself with the collar, using it to choke himself. After that the executioner tied him to the stake to make it impossible for him to kill himself. After the burning, their tongues were pulled out with tongs before each was killed with a burning dagger thrust through the heart. The bodies were placed in three iron baskets and hung from the steeple of St. Lambert's Church and the remains left to rot. About fifty years later the bones were removed, but the baskets remain.

Dan Carlin did a podcast on this entire subject called Prophets of Doom. If you have 4 hours to spare, it's worth a listen. Available on iTunes and [here](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-48-prophets-of-doom/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm definitely more intrigued by the idea of Rick dying now than I've ever been in the book series. He's obviously still relevant, but they've gotten the storyline to a point where they can revolve the books around a number of different characters and not one central figure. They're like a basketball team that goes 8-10 players deep. Negan, Jesus, Dwight, Angela, Maggie, Michonne, Carl, Lydia... Rick isn't as needed anymore and I'm really starting to think he'll be martyred off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LeBatard put it perfectly yesterday, if I was to tell you that Brad Kaaya will be the all time statistical leader in school history and declare for the NFL draft after his Junior season, you would've thought they'd have done more things. His sole *"big"* win is against college football powerhouse WVU. Yeah they were ranked, but this was not a good season for college football. Someone was going to be ranked #13 or whatever the heck they were. And yeah the team wasn't great, but we're in the ACC. Put any of the recent great college football QB's on this team and they're winning the conference. I'm not saying that you're saying he's an all timer, but to not at least make it to one ACC conference game in *this* conference? His run was a lackluster. Losing Njoku will be a bigger loss next season.

I really hate being the guy that *rips* a 20 year old and says he didn't meet expectations so this will be my last comment. I hope he gets drafted and does well in the NFL, and I'm excited for the future of Canes football. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All true. Fact remains that Kaaya still did nothing in 3 seasons. Do you want a 4th or should we try a new guy? That's my only point/opinion. I'm a Tannehill apologist and still think the Dolphins should look to draft a new QB every season until you know for sure what you have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with History is it's, I'm pretty sure, 100% scripted, at least on the episodes where it's just Aziz and Ashaya, thus making it super long winded. I love Radio Westeros and you can tell that they have talking points but just converse about them instead of reading their thoughts off paper. Aziz also really likes the sound of his voice and dominates the episodes, which is a shame during the GOT seasons because we end up going a couple of months without a good helping of the Radio Westeros crew. And this is just a me thing, but Aziz sometimes gets into a habit of smacking his lips making some of their episodes unlistenable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're honestly pretty much "divorced" already. I have my days with the kids, she has hers. I'm paying a set amount now until the actual mediator comes up with a  number. She hasn't, and I don't foresee her asking for alimony. My concern was more in line with a judge saying "wait a minute, you should be getting alimony too" and planting that seed. I guess I could always force the situation of either selling the house, or having her buy me out now, if she was to push that, but I don't think she will because she knows that the reason she didn't work had everything to do with her wanting to be a stay at home mom. I had been asking her during this entire time to get a job because the weight of being the sole earner was heavy on me and she simply said no, that she didn't want to.

The house situation does suck. I know she'll eventually start to date and who knows where that will lead. To me, losing any of my 401k to her is something that would really bother me at a deep level. I'm okay enough not getting that money now, and even offered her paying me 50 cents on the dollar to buy me out so we could be done with it, but she doesn't want to do that and essentially have no savings account. Maybe I can offer something in terms of once our daughter turns 18 she needs to pay me out or start the process of slowly paying me out.

Thanks for the info and positive wishes.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about alimony. Florida native. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-29 19:44:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all! I'm going through the process of a divorce and am becoming increasingly concerned with the idea of alimony.

Me and my ex are not going through attorneys but rather one of those attorney alternative agencies. We've been married 8 years and were separated for a full year 4 years ago where we went through the process of divorce through the same agency. We went all the way through to mediation then and I was only told that I'd have to pay child support.

We eventually reconciled and had another baby. My ex was a stay at home mom the last 3 years (her choice) but has been working the past month making a little bit less than I do on base (I work sale so I get base + commissions). She has not mentioned alimony and is only asking me to help pay half of our 3 year olds day care bill until we get to mediation.

By all measures we're friendly with each other and want this to be as stress free as possible. Our house is paid off and even though I know I'm being an idiot about this, I'm letting her keep the house and whenever she moves or sells, I'll get 50% of what the house is worth at the time of the divorce. I'm not thrilled about that, but I'm allowing it because she isn't touching my 401k after we split our main savings. We have our 3 year old, and 8 year old and she has a 13 year old from a previous relationship. If I forced her to pay me half of what it's worth now she wouldn't be able to and if I forced the selling of the house, she wouldn't be able to find a living arrangement as comfortable or affordable (she only has to be the HOA fees) as she is in now.

Could the idea of alimony be brought up during mediation? Is it something the judge will suggest once she has to report to court to finalize the divorce? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Considering getting a Russian Tortoise </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-27 21:34:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all!

I am considering getting a Russian tortoise. I will be heading over to the pet store today to check them out as well as some of the supplies so I can start mentally piecing things together. I probably wont actually get one for another couple of weeks.

Anyhow, I live in Florida. I just moved into an apartment and am a little nervous about leaving a heat lamp on while away at work. Would the tortoise be okay in my apartments patio? I wouldn't let him wander free, but I'd just carry him and his tote outside. I get a fair amount of direct sunlight.

Also, would one of those Rubbermaid totes be okay? I have kids and am always cautious about having glass around, especially if I'm going to be moving his container in and out. If Rubbermaid totes are okay, would the lamp effect the container? Would one of those lamps that has a clip work as well?

And lastly, and yes I'm going to review all of this with the pet store, I just like to crowd surf as much information as possible, would mulch be good for the tote or do you recommend something else?

Thanks in advance for all the info. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The best way to be a good father to your daughter starts with you taking care of yourself first. Get out of the house as soon as possible, especially if she's messing around with another guy on the side. I don't know how old you are, or who long y'all have been together, but dude, getting out now instead of spending a life with someone who cares so little about you **is** a blessing. Take care of yourself and be the best dad you can be to your girl. Not saying it wont not hurt, the betrayal and rejection sucks, but don't allow her to continue treating you like shit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well you did the right thing, so I applaud your decision. I had my car serviced a while back and they must've unbuckled the car seat during the minimal vacuuming/cleaning they did. The next day I'm driving around, I make a right turn and I hear my 3 year old go "WOAHHHHH". My son then says "Daddy, look at Zoe!" I turn around and her seat had tipped over. It was funny at the time but I realize how truly fortunate and blessed we were that it was a right turn in our neighborhood and not a car accident going at a higher speed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi!

So I'm a blood and platelet donor and truly enjoy doing it. It's been a few years since I've gotten a tattoo and when I did last, I obliged by the rules of not donating within a year. How serious is that though? I am wanting to get a small piece done, but don't want to have to stop donating. At the same time, I don't want to potentially pass something along to someone who's in obviously I need of blood or platelets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was talking with my buddy of mine about a hockey player who is injured because of a skate hitting his Achilles heel and before I could blink, a rush of images flashed before my eyes, from the scene in Childs Play 2 where the foster dad is walking down the stairs into the basement, to Herman Munster in Pet Sematary. I wanted to see what other types of injuries/deaths have stuck with the community over the years.

For me, the Achilles slashes have been my, well, Achilles. Another one that comes to mind immediately is the "I always wanted to be a surgeon" scene from Hostel. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mediation, child support </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-24 19:39:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello! So I'm going to be going through a divorce in the next month or two. Me and my ex are fairly reasonable and wont be going through an attorney. This is actually the 2nd time we'll be doing this. The first time was 5 years ago. We ended up reconciling and having another children since then.

Anyhow, she's been a stay-at-home mom the last few years and is in the process of finding work. I want to make sure that I'm not crazy by wanting to hold off on signing anything until she has a job and maybe has a paycheck or two under her belt? We have two children, they'll be with them about 50% of the time (3 days one week, 4 days the next, etc). I'll more than likely be providing them with benefits although she has another son from a previous relationship, so it might be easier for her to cover them all.

Anyhow, am I reasonable and in the right for not wanting to do mediation or sign anything until she's established some level of income?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! So in the last week or two, I've noticed some distinct pain in my right thigh, about 6 inches or so above the knee, right in the thigh. It comes and goes. I haven't noticed if it's more noticeable while I'm sitting around at work or if I'm out and about. It's pretty sharp at some times but I'm not necessarily hobbled by it either. No bruising. I'm 6', 240 or so. I just got back from a Disney trip 2 weeks ago where I was averaging 20k+ steps a day. Could this be something serious? My mind always jumps to the absolute worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all, getting these candies have been a major struggle, uphill battle for me and my son but we're finally there. I'd really like to make this one count, so if I should hold off until I obtain a better Dragonair please let me know. This would be our first Dragonite.


These are the Dragonair's we have right now:


CP 851, 64%-73% IV

CP 585, 84%-88% IV


Thanks in advance.

Edit: I probably will not do pvp once it's available but we do battle a gym or two every day. For me, I'd like to get a good Dragonite, but it doesn't necessarily need to be the best possible one I could get. My 7 year old has been highly anticipating this day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know why, but I was reminiscing on my drive home about how great Bo's weekly spot used to be. I remember laughing so hard during the Brett Favre text scandal, with Stu admitting he looked up the pictures to compare himself. Bo, being a combination of baffled and disgusted, called Stu a "meat peeper."

Anyone else have any favorite Bomani moments? </TEXT>

I've only been able to find a gif of the [following](https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dHIFxZmZE0i6T0dnV9n2kA--/aD0yODE7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/cd/diminuendo/1.0/original/60354b45ef40007ddc523319bafedb4dd8cfc7b5.gif). I'm trying to get one where you see the lead up to the air punches, with Lee pushing his chest out towards Gamby. Me and my manager have been talking about this particular scene a ton and I'd love to have it to share back and forth. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

I'll be there for one night, and I don't plan on spending too much time in the room, so I don't really need anything too fancy. Also, are there a lot of tolls on the highways? I don't have a Sun Pass so I'm just trying to think ahead. Anything I should be mindful of? I want to avoid being a bad visitor. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a note: 28 Weeks Later is on HBO On Demand on Xfinity and I'd imagine HBO Go too. Not sure what the overall consensus is of the movie but I love it. The opening scene bothered me deeply when I saw it in the theater and the London stuff with American GI involvement angle was cool too. The movie also introduced me to Jeremy Renner which was nice as well. </TEXT>

2. Was it worth it?
3. Would you do it again? Why, why not?
4. How much actual interaction goes on between the contestants and cameramen, show runners, etc?

Did he actually give him Dawn to fight with, or did he give him Dawn in the sense that he killed him with it?  </TEXT>

Aside from the  recent Michael B Jordan pod, what other ones (as far as guests are concerned) did he do where he may have touched on the show? I've always fast forwarded through those segments because I didn't want to spoil the show. Actors, producers, show runners, etc. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, so I've tried Googling around and I'm just not seeing it. When I was a kid, around the late 80's, maybe early 90's, me and my dad watched a movie about an Australian salt water crocodile that was reeking havoc on the local area. A group of, I believe, scientists/zoo officials decided to capture it because it was supposed to be super large. The last scene took place in the dark, obviously. Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? I think it may have had an aborigine word for the title. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After finishing today's event with my 1st Dino taking out 8 of the 9 and my 2nd Dino not having taken any damage, I thought it be fun if we had some sort of a tiered competition, ie: if you defeat 5 Dino's with a team of 3, you win a common, if you beat 9 with your 3, you gets the rare, etc., maxing out with maybe 15 Dino's to get a Legendary? This way the folks who are newer to the game can participate and get something as well as the ones who have been playing a while get something a better but still need to earn it. I'm sure this will lead nowhere, but I thought it was a good idea. </TEXT>

I'm kind of surprised he's been included in the after show. He just seems super uninformed about the topic overall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello! I hope this is okay to be posted here, but I've recently discovered the Radio Westeros pod and the alt+shift+x YouTube channel. What are some of the other well-done forms of media that are out there that are tilted towards breaking down the books, theories, etc. I'm not opposed to ones that touch on the shows, just prefer the book side of things. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Old Nan had told him the same story once, Bran remembered, but when he asked Robb if it was true, his brother laughed and asked him if he believed in grumkins too. He wished Robb were with them now. Id tell him I could fly, but he wouldnt believe, so Id have to showhim. I bet that he could learn to fly too, him and Arya and Sansa, even baby Rickon and Jon Snow. We could all be ravens and live in Maester Luwins rookery. </TEXT>

I'm thinking of visiting the Albuquerque/Santa Fe area sometime in the next month of two. Any suggestions on places to visit/things to do? So far on my list is just the Wild Spirit Sanctuary in Santa Fe. Ideally looking for hiking/biking trail ideas. Anything to do with animals. Are any of the Breaking Bad locations worth a visit? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, so this popped in my head a couple of days ago. Does anyone remember exactly how it went? He was talking about having a woman call him at night to trick his wife into thinking he was a catch, thus tricking her into wanting him more? Was the slogan, "all the headaches of adultery without the benefits"?

If anyone knows when this happened or has the clip, I would much appreciate it. </TEXT>

I'm listening to Wednesdays show right now and during the local hour, they brought up that Greg started a new bit where he brought in stuff from his garage and apparently he brought in his little league baseball mitt. Was this something they did off the air that they're giving us now, or was it just not on the podcast? Was it a TV exclusive? Thanks, I'll hang up and listen. </TEXT>

On a couple of the other subs I subscribe to they've edited the terms "users" to something specific to what the board represents, and thought it would be fun to have something like "108 Scores men here now," or "Wack Packers." Any other suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I was trying to find the Dennis Hof/Jo Koy episode from May 18, 2015. For some reason, the link on the main website gives you an option to click play but doesn't actually play. The Podcast One page for this episode also doesn't play it. If I'm doing something wrong please let me know. I tried on my computer and mobile. Thanks in advance!

<TITLE> Question re: Yaris C Eco/EV Modes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-04 19:37:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! So I just purchased my first Yaris and was wondering what was the best way to maximize my gas MPG. I drive about 70 total miles/day, with about 65 of them being on the highway. Traffic tends to be pretty fluid and not too bad. I don't go to fast when on the highway, I like a cruising speed of 60-65 mph. When on the highway, should I turn off Eco mode? I feel like the car is "clunky" or struggling when I'm on the highway. Any other pointers? It's a 2015 Yaris C. </TEXT>

Side note, I always laughed when Marcellus' iPhone calendar reminder sound went off a minute into the segment. It literally happened every week. I can only imagine what the calendar reminder said; LeBatard Show, Love Doctor Segment, Mattress Plug. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's easy to goof on Jackie because of how things ended for him and how great Artie ran with his chair, but I think a lot of us have forgotten how funny/entertaining he was. I came across this last night and while the jokes are terrible, his ability to at times even guess the punch line is impressive.

<TEXT> So, of everyone that's been banned for one reason or another, with the exception of Artie because he'd be the overwhelming favorite, if you could have one person back on the show somewhat regularly, who ya got? This could include people who aren't necessarily banned but just walked away from the show like Crackhead Bob, John the Stutterer, etc.

My top three would be Gilbert, Elliott and probably Stuttering John, with the Elegant one winning by a nose. </TEXT>
