<TEXT> From the article:

The move exposed Mr. Trump to the suspicion that he has something to hide and could strain his relations with fellow Republicans who may be wary of defending him when they do not have all the facts. Many Republicans issued cautious statements on Tuesday, but a few expressed misgivings about Mr. Comeys dismissal and called for a special congressional investigation or independent commission to take over from the House and Senate Intelligence Committees now looking into the Russia episode.

Please contact your representatives in Congress, especially if they are Republican.

<TEXT> Listening to the hearing, Flynn appears to have **done** something that (1) there's evidence of, (2) the Russians have the evidence of, and (3) that would destroy his career.  Yates just testified that she warned the Trump administration about that before they kept Flynn on for another eighteen days as National Security Advisor.  Further, Senator Feinstein reiterated the news reports that Obama warned the Trump administration about Flynn months before they brought Flynn on as National Security Advisor.

What sort of idiots are unconcerned about having as the National Security Advisor in their administration someone vulnerable to blackmail by Putin? </TEXT>

* They're completely mercenary, but judge that the advantages of graduating a star student quickly outweigh the advantages of trying to exploit slave labor.  A star Ph.D. graduate can go to another university but keep collaborating with you, can expand your influence in your field, can serve par encourager les autres, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even in the USA, you can go bachelor's to Ph.D. in 3 or 3.5 years in the sciences and math.  Those are best-case scenarios, to be sure, but if everything goes smoothly and you quickly accomplish a notable piece of original research, a good advisor and a good program will graduate you so that you can continue your career.  Note: does not apply to slavedriving advisors who are trying to exploit you.

Also, a one-hour dissertation defense seems perfectly reasonable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pro tip for anyone reading this who hasn't defended: if your advisor is at least minimally competent, your advisor will not allow you to defend unless you're going to pass. ^^with ^^one ^^specific ^^exception

All right, the specific exception is if your graduate program is trying to get rid of you, and all other subtler methods of trying to accomplish that goal have failed.  So if your advisor has been hinting that you may want to take a leave of absence from the program and you've been ignoring the hints, okay, maybe your "defense" is actually the merciful execution of your unrealistic postgraduate ambitions.  Otherwise, you're going to pass.

I need to finish off O-Chul story for the Kickstarter backers, which I need a few more days...this week? Maybe?...and then a regular comic.

Once O-Chul's done I'll be able to focus on the main strip again for a bit.

Rather, Trump "errs" in failing to fully exploit the opportunities that the presidency, in combination with certain dysfunctions in our government and our society, affords him.  Someone skilled, or even just reasonably competent, at consolidating power would, for example, not waste time watching as much television and playing as much golf as Trump does.  Further, while Trump engages in some fights that are very useful to him, but he also picks a lot of fights that don't help him achieve anything. </TEXT>

As a point of trivia, the first compensatory pick that year was by the Steelers, but he became much more famous as a Patriot: Mike Vrabel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It shouldnt have been signed, Trump said in the White Houses East Room. It shouldnt have been negotiated the way that it was negotiated. And we are analyzing it very carefully, and we will have something to say about it in the not-too-distant future."

Sounds as if there's a good chance that the Trump administration will do with Iran what it has repeatedly done with situations that it is "analyzing carefully" and "will have something to say about in the not-too-distant future": a big fat nothing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's interesting to me that the simulated results are becoming increasingly asymmetrical over the course of the three simulations you've recently posted.  Is the starting position becoming less symmetrical, or is it just an effect of the collisions becoming more violent?  I wonder how much randomization the underlying simulation algorithms use, or if they're supposed to be totally deterministic and we're seeing the effects of chaos on rounding errors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any future value function will work; =FV(rate, number of periods, payment, present value) in Excel, or any [online future value calculator.](http://www.calculator.net/future-value-calculator.html) 

The formula for the future value based on the present value is (present value) x (1 + rate)^(number of periods).

The formula for the future value based on payments at the end of periods is 
(payment amount) x ((1 + rate)^(number of periods) - 1)/rate.

For the future value based both on present value and on payments at the end of periods, add those two formulas together.

The rate is **per period**.  For example, 6% annual interest compounded monthly is a rate of 6%/12 = 0.5%.

Here's an example: you owe $10,000 on your credit cards right now at 12% interest, compounded monthly.  You pay off $150 of the existing balance every month.  How much will you still owe after two years?

Rate is 12%/12 = 1%.  Number of periods is 2 (years) x 12 (months in a year) = 24.  Payment is -$150, because you are taking $150 out of your hands and putting it into your credit-card account.  Present value is $10,000, because you got $10,000 of value from your credit-card account.

Future value based on present value is ($10,000) x (1 + 1%)^24 = $10,000 x (1.01)^24 = $10,000 x 1.269735 = $12,697.35.

Future value based on payments is -$150 x ((1 + 1%)^24 - 1)/1% = -$150 x ((1.01)^24 - 1)/1% = -$150 x (1.269735 - 1)/1% = -$150 x (0.269735)/1% = -$150 x 26.9735 = -$4,046.03.

Adding them together, we get $12,697.35 - $4,046.03 = $8,651.32.  You made 24 payments of $150 each, which adds up to $3,600, but you only paid off about $1,350 of your $10,000 in credit card debt.  Maybe you should pay off your debt more quickly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes, it's clearly more stability making the coach, rather than the coach making stability.  Consider this coach's seasons:

* .688, lost in first round of playoffs
* .563, lost in first round of playoffs
* .750, lost in second round of playoffs
* .688, lost in league finals
* .625, lost in second round of playoffs
* .688, lost in second round of playoffs
* .438
* .375

Time to get rid of the coach yet?  Let's consider a few more seasons.

* .563
* .813, lost in second round of playoffs
* .667, lost in second round of playoffs
* .375

Are you still keeping this coach around?  If you are... then here are the next two seasons.

* .938, lost in second round of playoffs
* .688, Super Bowl XL champions

This is Bill Cowher, of course.

(He stayed around for one more season after winning the Super Bowl, going .500, and then retired.)

<TEXT> I've said this before: when multiple law enforcement officials leaked the information that Carter Page was under surveillance via a FISA warrant, it was the hurricane warning for all low-lying areas of the Trump administration.  The warning was twofold:

* After the warrant was issued last summer, any communications between Page and any members of the Trump campaign/administration, including any communications that might have occurred between Page and Trump himself, could reasonably be assumed to be in the hands of the FBI.

* Leaking the existence of the warrant meant that law enforcement already has everything they wanted from surveilling Page.  That's not good news for anyone who thought they may have managed to hide any scurrilous behavior.

The misconception that the Mona Lisa is painted on canvas is not limited to the grandparent poster; it was shared by Pat Hutchins, author of *The Mona Lisa Mystery* (The Bodley Head, 1981). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah.  This is not the first result of its kind.  In 2012, the full USWNT scrimmaged the U-17 USMNT, and the boys won 8-2.  That  USWNT went on to win six of six matches in the UK, en route to the gold medal in the London Olympics.

There's an endearing story from Bruce Arena's first stint managing the national (men's) team.  The USWNT had just won the 1999 Women's World Cup, and some clueless general sports journalist asked Arena what he thought the men's team's chances would be in a match against the women's team.  Arena apparently said, "Well, I hope we could give them a good game." </TEXT>

<TEXT> For example, here's the latest release of evidence everyone should see: the then-National Security Advisor of the USA, Michael Flynn, [listing thirty sources of compensation on a disclosure form, but somehow omitting any disclosure of Russian propagandist compensation.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ao33b0bfim14awi/Flynn%2C%20Michael%202-11-17.pdf?dl=0)  News broke yesterday that he had actually also been compensated by Russian propagandists.  Oops.

Now, this is not yet a "smoking gun" for the Trump administration, and neither is any of the other evidence that has come out so far.  That's why no Russian-collusion impeachment trial has started yet.  But when you ask yourself "which explanation is more likely: that the Trump administration has colluded with Russia and is trying to cover it up, or that this is all much ado about nothing?"... I think the answer is clear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me try an analogy.

Company C has a job opening.  After reviewing resumes and interviewing applicants, there are two candidates remaining, Candidate A and Candidate B.  They seem equally suitable for the job.  So Company C decides to speak to the candidates' professional references, and it just so happens that they share a reference, Reference R.

Reference R knows some things about A and B that Company C doesn't.  Reference R knows a little negative information about A; even with that negative information, A will still be suitable, but not quite as attractive as Company C's current evaluation.

However, Reference R knows damning information about B.  B is actually a horrible candidate, and Company C would be better off hiring nobody than hiring B.

Reference R releases the little bit of negative information about Candidate A to Company C.  But Reference R does **not** tell Company C any of the negative information about Candidate B.  That's because Reference R has an ulterior motive of wanting Company C to fail.  So Company C hires Candidate B.

Note that everything that Reference R has said is the truth!  But it turns out that having more of the truth is sometimes both much worse than having less of the truth, and also much worse than having all of the truth.

To answer your other question, it is at least quite possible that Russia has information about Trump, or information gleaned from hacking the RNC, or both.  Russia has released none of this information. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depending on the ebbs and flows of teams' strengths, you can usually closely replicate the assignment of berths in the 32-team World Cup by giving half the berths based on the strongest teams in the world, and half the berths based on the number of teams in each confederation.  That seems to be the right sort of idea, at least: balancing a desire to have strong teams with a desire to have geographic diversity.

Presumably we don't just want to take the strongest 48 teams to a 48-team World Cup.  That would probably mean taking **all** of CONMEBOL, or close to it.

I think CONMEBOL should have at least five and a half berths in a 32-team World Cup, and similarly, seven berths plus a play-in in a 48-team World Cup. </TEXT>

They somehow managed to concede a semifinal WCQ draw to Guatemala in Port of Spain, and neither their semifinal WCQ matches against the USA nor their hex matches so far inspire confidence.  Their only good result of those six matches is that 1-0 home win against Panama.

I think Panama could be decent this cycle, and I'd like to see more from them.

I definitely do **not** think Honduras is decent this cycle.  I think they're in the midst of a significant downswing.  8 points in the semifinal round?!

Jamaica was certainly decent and then some in the 2015 Gold Cup, but has looked shaky since. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Africa's nine spots are the least of my concerns.  There are generally at least a dozen or so decent teams in CAF.

CONCACAF getting six spots is scary.  There have never simultaneously been six decent CONCACAF teams at the same time.  Usually, there are three or four.

But if CONCACAF is scary, then AFC is a horror show.  Japan and South Korea are consistently decent, and Australia is often up there as well.  Iran and Saudi Arabia have their moments.  After that... ye gods.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Seth Abramson called it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/846135383129772032) three days ago (via /u/alixsyd):

MEGA-THREAD: MI6 agent Chris STEELE, author of history's most explosive intel dossier, will soon testify against TRUMP. Read his story here.

(1) Between 6/20/16 and 12/13/16, former MI6 agent STEELE compiled an intel dossier establishing TRUMP and allies had committed treason.

(2) STEELE first worked for anti-Trump GOP operatives, but most of his research was done for free due to his concern for the intel on TRUMP.

(3) Between 6/1 and 11/18, parts of the dossier were variously held by anti-Trump GOPers, the MI6, FBI friends of Steele, and David Corn.

(4) During this time--largely pre-election--there is no evidence that any of the dossier's sources had been identified or in any way harmed.

(5) From 11/18 to 12/9, John MCCAIN was also aware of the dossier. During this period, none of the dossier's sources were blown or harmed.

(6) Between 11/18 and 12/9 MCCAIN acquired the dossier. The Guardian reports MCCAIN didn't share it--to avoid looking vengeful toward TRUMP.

(7) On 12/9, MCCAIN gave the dossier to COMEY. Presumably, COMEY thereafter shared it with other agents at the FBI.

(8) The NEW YORK FIELD OFFICE of the FBI is known to have illegally leaked confidential information to TRUMP advisers GIULIANI and PRINCE.

(9) GIULIANI and PRINCE--a TRUMP "shadow adviser" and brother to DEVOS--have admitted to having active FBI sources.

(10) Former TRUMP National Security Adviser Michael FLYNN was just found to have active (and paid) FBI sources also.

(11) Within seventeen days of the FBI having possession of Steele's dossier, the chief source behind the dossier had been murdered by PUTIN.

(12) On 12/26, the top aide and most trusted advisor of SECHIN, head of Russia's oil/gas company, was found murdered in the back of his car.

(13) The deceased man, former FSB agent Oleg EROVINKIN, was the trusted "go-between between SECHIN and PUTIN," also both former FSB agents.

(14) The dossier accused SECHIN of offering TRUMP, via PAGE, money from Russia's oil company ROSNEFT in exchange for lifting U.S. sanctions.

(15) The theory PUTIN helped elect TRUMP and offered money via SECHIN for lifting sanctions (allowing a ROSNEFT pipeline) is "#Russiagate."

(16) The death of SECHIN aide/STEELE source EROVINKIN was reported as a heart attack before an autopsy had occurred.

(17) By 12/29, outlets reporting EROVINKIN died in the back of his car via heart attack were withdrawing the claim.

(18) While news of the death wouldn't break widely until late January, it's reasonable to assume Steele had heard about it by early January.

(19) The reason for this is that former FSB and ROSNEFT man EROVINKIN was--as later became public--the chief source for the STEELE dossier.

(20) As there was no reason for STEELE to think on 12/26 the FSB had his dossier, there was no reason for him to think EROVINKIN was killed.

(21) On 1/10, BUZZFEED published the STEELE dossier. Steele was quickly outed as author by the WSJ, endangering him.

(22) The BUZZFEED publication also would've confirmed for STEELE that EROVINKIN had indeed been identified and thereafter murdered by PUTIN.

(23) On 1/12, STEELE and his family abandoned their home in Surrey with no indication of whether they'd ever return.

(24) By 1/12, British media had established Steele's strong reputation in the IC as former Russia-desk head for MI6.

(25) Meanwhile, U.S. media did little research on STEELE--and indulged claims by TRUMP that STEELE was a "failed spy" peddling "fake news."

(26) By 1/27, it had been leaked that EROVINKIN, a "go-between for PUTIN and SECHIN," was a primary dossier source.

(27) The news of EROVINKIN being linked to the dossier within a matter of days increased the credibility of the dossier for law enforcement.

(28) On 2/11 CBS said "it's gaining credibility among law enforcement--even for people who discounted it initially."

(29) On 2/27 reports placed Steele in Cambridge after 7 weeks without a sighting, though he remained away from home.

(30) On 3/1 it was revealed the FBI had enough confidence in the dossier that it offered to pay STEELE to expand it.

(31) On 3/2, SENATE DEMS contacted STEELE via friends and offered to help him testify before their Intel Committee.

(32) On 3/7, STEELE emerged from hiding and told the press, "I won't be making any further statements at this time."

(33) A reasonable speculation is that STEELE's emergence from hiding was prompted at least in part by U.S. assurances he'd be foregrounded.

(34) The more attention U.S. officials gave STEELE, and the more legitimacy their statements lent to his work, the safer he was from PUTIN.

(35) On 3/17 it was confirmed that a STEELE source, MILLIAN, met with former MANAFORT boss (DERIPASKA) in June 2016.

(36) DERIPASKA, a close ally of PUTIN, had paid MANAFORT $10 million annually from 2006 to 2009 to shill for Russia.

(37) MANAFORT, whose current tie to DERIPASKA/PUTIN is unknown, has now been found to have laundered his Russia pay.

(38) The MILLIAN/DERIPASKA meet further confirmed the dossier originated from sources in a position to know the movements of TRUMP advisers.

(39) On 3/20, the HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE met publicly with COMEY. The Dems cited STEELE's dossier repeatedly.

(40) Within 72 hours the Dems had indicated they intended to ask STEELE to testify. Citing his dossier was likely intended to keep him safe.

(41) The likely Dem theory: if the dossier's content is not just public but made public by Congress, PUTIN gains nothing in killing STEELE.

(42) On 3/23, Rep. Himes (D-CT) of the HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE told CBS, "Well want to talk to Christopher Steele."

(43) Himes' statement confirmed the House as well as the Senate was interested in STEELE and had a new level of confidence he would testify.

(44) In the past (e.g. after the 2004 election) minority parties in Congressional committees have scheduled informal meetings for witnesses.

(45) So even when the GOP refuses to let STEELE formally testify, HOUSE AND SENATE DEMS can (and say they will) schedule informal testimony.

(46) The benefit of informal testimony is that Dems can televise the testimony so long as STEELE agrees to discuss no classified U.S. intel.

(47) So there's every reason to believe that (a) STEELE has strong sources, (b) PUTIN won't kill him, and (c) he will soon testify publicly.

(48) For all the lies told by TRUMP and ALLIES about both STEELE and his dossier, in fact virtually none of it has been disproven to date.

(49) E.g., PAGE has confessed to ROSNEFT meets; the ROSNEFT sale was as described; COHEN was a courier as described.

(50) In sum, the IC and Democrats increasingly think the STEELE dossier and #Russiagate theory are accurate. If so, TRUMP will be impeached. </TEXT>

Yes.  That's the only way Trump could bring back coal jobs: by somehow causing the costs of fracking to rise so much that coal would become price-competitive again.

Dear Erik Wemple, author of this article:

The phrase *ad hominem* applies both to males and to females.  The word *hominem* is a Latin form of the word for "human".  It's not as if that phrase uses a Latin form of *vir*.

Sean Spicer was indulging in an *ad hominem* attack, but not in an *ad feminam* attack.  There was nothing particular chauvinistic about this sentence:

<TEXT> But congressional sources say that the offer by Manaforts lawyer, Reginald Brown, a former White House lawyer under President George W. Bush, was carefully hedged. There was no explicit promise to testify in public or address a broad range of questions that have been raised about Manaforts business and lobbying work over the years for figures closely associated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

This is an interview, not testimony, Jason Maloni, Manaforts spokesman, told Yahoo News. A statement by Maloni says only that Manafort is willing to provide information about recent allegations about Russian interference in the election. It says nothing about recent accusations regarding disguised payments made to Manafort from the political party of the pro-Putin former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, or his past work for Oleg Deripaska, a prominent pro-Putin oligarch  both of which have been cited by Democrats as evidence of close ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.

Forget this.  Congress can just subpoena the bastard.  If he wants to plead the Fifth, let him; his silence would speak volumes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NATURE OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATION: Representative Duncan D. Hunters congressional campaign committee, Duncan D. Hunter for Congress, reported expenditures that may not be legitimate and verifiable campaign expenditures attributable to bona fide campaign or political purposes. Rep. Hunter may have converted tens of thousands of dollars of campaign funds from his congressional campaign committee to personal use to pay for family travel, flights, utilities, health care, school uniforms and tuition, jewelry, groceries, and other goods, services, and expenses.

If Rep. Hunter converted funds from his congressional campaign committee for personal use, then he may have violated House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law.

RECOMMENDATION: The Board recommends that the Committee on Ethics further review the above allegations concerning Rep. Hunter because there is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Hunter converted campaign funds to personal use to pay expenses that were not legitimate and verifiable campaign expenditures attributable to bona fide campaign or political purposes.

<TEXT> Incredibly, this commentary piece, less than half an hour old, is already out of date: the latest revelations are now that House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes has claimed that personal communications of the Trump transition team, and possibly of Trump himself, have been picked up by investigators.  Nunes also claims that the communications are incidental collection, but not Russia-related.

The next-to-latest revelations discussed in this commentary piece are Manafort's work as a Russian asset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes said Wednesday that President Donald Trump's personal communications may have been picked up by investigators through "incidental collection."

Translation: investigators are conducting surveillance on what we'll call a bad dude.  Trump communicates with the bad dude.  Investigators now have Trump's communications with the bad dude.

Nunes said at a news conference he discovered the potential surveillance of Trump himself while reviewing intelligence reports, but said it was not related to Russia.

Being "not related to Russia" only narrows it down somewhat.  For example, could the bad dude be an Azerbaijani money-launderer?

"This is a normal, incidental collection, based on what I could collect," Nunes said. "This appears to be all legally collected foreign intelligence under" the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Okay, investigators are not overstepping their bounds here.

Nunes said the collection included Trump transition officials, and also said that it happened after the election. He said he could not say whether it meant that Trump was "spied on".

"I'm not going to get into legal definitions, bit clearly I have a concern," he said.

Uh, yeah, I have a concern too: why are Trump transition officials, and possibly Trump himself, communicating with a bad dude? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the full text of Comey's opening statement, arbitrarily split into paragraphs by me, with grammar and punctuation also corrected by me.

Mr. Chairman, ranking Member Schiff, members of the Committee, thank you for including me in todays hearing. Im honored to be here representing the people of the FBI. I hope we have shown you through our actions and our words how much we at the FBI value your oversight of our work, and how much we respect your responsibility to investigate those things which are important to the American people. Thank you for showing that both are being taken very seriously.

As you know our practice is not to confirm the existence of ongoing investigations, especially those investigations that involve classified matters. But, in unusual circumstances, where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so, as Justice Department policies recognize. This is one of those circumstances.

I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm, that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian governments efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. And that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russias efforts. As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.

Because it is an open, ongoing investigation, and is classified, I cannot say more about what we are doing, and whose conduct we are examining. At the request of congressional leaders, we have taken the extraordinary step, in coordination with the Department of Justice, of briefing this Congresss leaders, including the leaders of this committee in a classified setting in detail about the investigation. But I cant go into those details here.

I know that is extremely frustrating to some folks. I hope you and the American people can understand, the FBI is very careful in how we handle information about our cases, and about the people we are investigating. We are also very careful about how we handle information that may be of interest to our foreign adversaries. Both of those interests are at issue in a counterintelligence investigation. 

Please dont draw any conclusions from the fact that I may not be able to comment on certain topics. I know speculating is part of human nature. But it really isnt fair to draw conclusions simply because I say I cant comment. 

Some folks may want to make comparisons to past instances where the Department of Justice and the FBI have spoken about the details of some investigations. But please keep in mind that those involved the details of completed investigations. Our ability to share details with the Congress and with the American people is limited when those investigations are still open. Which I hope makes sense. We need to protect peoples privacy. We need to make sure we dont give other people clues as to where were going. We need to make sure we dont give information to our foreign adversaries about what we know or dont know. We just cannot do our work well or fairly if we start talking about it while were doing it. So we will try very, very hard to avoid that, as we always do.

This work is very complex, and there is no way for me to give you a timetable as to when it will be done. We approach this work in an open-minded and independent way, and our expert investigators will conclude that work as quickly as they can, but they will always do it well no matter how long that takes. I can promise you we will follow the facts wherever they lead.

And I want to underscore something my friend Mike Rogers said: Leaks of classified information are serious, serious federal crimes for a reason. They should be investigated and where possible prosecuted in a way that reflects that seriousness so that people understand that it simply cannot be tolerated. And I look forward to taking your questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the tenor of the Comey and Rogers hearings going on right now are any indication, House Republicans are not yet generally ready to move toward impeachment, and such a move toward impeachment would seem to be a precondition for a Trump resignation.  Obviously, if truly significant developments were to occur, such as the FBI starting to arrest members of the Trump campaign, then the landscape would change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since I'm intimately familiar with model theory, please allow me to go into pop-science lecture mode for a few moments.

In mathematical logic, if our set of axioms is inconsistent (contradictory when taken as a whole), they're useless, because with such a set of axioms, we can prove any proposition both true and false.  So it is of utmost importance that our set of axioms be consistent.

We'll talk about "sufficiently powerful" a couple of times, which is here roughly defined as "supporting addition and multiplication of natural numbers" (that is, nonnegative integers).  Obviously, this is not a particularly high bar for a set of axioms.

Gdel published two incompleteness theorems in the 1930s.  The first was shocking and controversial in its day, but somewhat ho-hum now.  The second theorem, however, is undiminished in its jaw-dropping consequence.

The first incompleteness theorem states that any consistent, sufficiently powerful set of axioms is incomplete: working from those axioms, while we can prove that many propositions are true, and that many other propositions are false, there are propositions which we can neither prove true nor prove false from those axioms.  This theorem was shocking in itself at the time because it immediately made useless any attempt to create a complete mathematical model.

But the first incompleteness theorem is no longer particularly shocking.  No one tries to create complete mathematical models any more, and the propositions shown to be beyond the power of proof were essentially of the form "This sentence is false", which are yawn-inducing.

The proof of the first incompleteness theorem was controversial at the time, because it essentially treated what we might now consider to be "code" as what we might now consider to be "data", and very few people in the 1930s had any framework for accepting those concepts.  But we treat code as data all the time now, and we're very comfortable doing so.

Ah, then we come to the second incompleteness theorem: given a consistent, sufficiently powerful set of axioms, among the propositions that we can neither prove true nor prove false is "This set of axioms is consistent."  Think about what this means for a minute.  If we can never prove that our set of axioms is consistent, then we will never be able to rule out the possibility that everything we do with those axioms is pointless, because we could be unknowingly working with an inconsistent set of axioms.

Now we turn to real life.  Sometimes people try to pretend that they are coldly logical machines, and that they always act strictly in accordance with a set of principles.  Well, if that set of principles includes the ability to do fourth-grade arithmetic, then we know that either that set of principles is inconsistent with itself, or at least that we'll never be able to prove consistency in that set of principles.  So every reasonable belief system is in some sense a house of cards, necessarily based on a certain amount of unprovable faith in its consistency, and deservedly subject to skepticism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I upvoted you for your thoughtful and painstaking response -- but to use your phrase, it's close to "absolute nonsense".  Considering those of us who endorse the evolution of species, the benefits of vaccination, a heliocentric view of the solar system, and the like: far, far more than 0.1% of us have considered the evidence directly.  Further, there is a qualitative difference between falsifiable beliefs subject to the scientific method, and unshakeable beliefs independent of evidence.

Of course, we all choose (or arrive in some other way at) our personal axioms that we live by, and Gdel's second incompleteness theorem lurks as a trap for the unwary.  But there are fundamental and real differences between critical thinking and uncritical acceptance, and between logic and illogic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's talk about the two pieces of this.

1) White House Press Secretary 101: deniability.  It is the job of the Press Secretary to avoid being a person of interest in any story.  That's so, for example, you can answer questions like "What went on in XYZ meeting?" with "You'll have to ask the participants in XYZ meeting."  That answer doesn't work if you yourself were in XYZ meeting.  Sean Spicer needed to get almost anyone else in the Trump administration to make those calls to CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Senator Burr.

2) Contacting the head of an intelligence agency and the Senate Intelligence Committee chair to have them speak to journalists, if they're pushing back against a story that ends up being true, is participating in a cover-up.  Covering up something that may well be a crime can itself be a crime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Congress is slow to investigate, the press can pursue their own investigations.  But wait, when will the press have the opportunity to directly question the central figure in this story, Sean Spicer?

Oh yeah, they'll have that opportunity **every single day** because he's the everloving **Press Secretary** and answering questions from the press is **his actual job.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want so badly to play poker against Trumpindeed, against most of the people in his administration.  They're a total mess of tells, giving away so much information about their guilt.

Were they innocent of treasonous Russia conductwhich they've made very obvious that they're notor even in the actual scenario in which they're guilty, the simple and effective strategy is to put on a brave face:
We welcome all inquiries into the nature of our administration's relationship with Russia.  These inquiries will allow us to make clear that our conduct has been aboveboard and that we have nothing to hide.

Then, you fight your PR war with subtlety: get people to think of the investigations as a "partisan witch hunt" and a "waste of taxpayers' money" by using your backchannel contacts.

But no.  It's all bluster and bluff and blather.  We know you're holding only seven-high and you're going to lose the showdown; every move you make just reinforces that certainty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you. It is justly so, for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from different causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.

<TEXT> I seem to be attracting Trump defenders lately when I comment on the immigration ban in these threads.  The Trump defenders seem to like to try to draw some tenuous equivalents between this immigration ban and some action of the Obama administration.

Here's the real question, though: who benefits from this immigration ban?!  Obviously not the banned people.  But nobody else in America seems to benefit either.  What possible increase in security, or other advantage, does it convey to Americans?

The only people who seem to benefit from this ban are America's enemies. </TEXT>

But there are also plenty of people who think, "I know all this stuff about total-order forward search using task-network planning.  Wow, there must be just as much stuff to learn about the helium line in the sun's spectrum.  And just as much stuff to learn about the journey motif in the works of Eudora Welty.  And just as much stuff to learn about how to run a recycling center.  And about how to drive a truck that picks up trash and recycling.  And how to operate a television camera at a sporting event.  So **the depths of my ignorance must be profound.**" </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a lot of reasons being provided in this thread about why an owner would vote against a team's move in that owner's self-interest.  Let me provide a different reason: because some things are right and some things are wrong, and some owners vote against things that they know are wrong.

Dan Rooney voted against the Browns' move not because of any particular self-interest, and not because of any love lost for the Browns, but because... I'll let him tell it:
But I was disturbed when I learned that Art Modell would move his Browns from Cleveland.  Not only were the Browns the natural rival of the Steelers, one of the best rivalries in sports, but their fans were among the most devoted in the NFL.  It was a sad day for Cleveland, a sad day for Pittsburgh, and a sad day for the league when the Browns traded in their orange and brown uniforms for Baltimore Ravens purple. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's only one way to shut some of the Patriots fans up about their "#1 scoring defense", and we have to hold this game to have any chance of that.  Hey, those of you Patriots fans who are statistically and strategically naive: you have a powerful offense, more powerful than the Steelers offense, and your defense is perfectly fine, especially against the run.  But the Patriots defense is nowhere near the best in the NFL, and it's *really* untested.  You've faced one reasonably good quarterback this year: Russell Wilson, and he led the Seahawks offense to 420 yards, 31 points, and a victory in Foxborough.

Of course, it's not the Patriots' fault that they're untested: a team can only play the schedule it's given.  There's a Patriots fan who has put together a statistical scheme for evaluating these sorts of questions: "this team has dominated a lot of inferior opposition; how good will it be when tested against stronger opposition?"  That Patriots fan is Aaron Schatz of Football Outsiders: he evaluates the Patriots as [the best team in the NFL,](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/dvoa-ratings/2017/week-19-dvoa-ratings) but also [a team with real questions about its pass defense.](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef)

The Patriots are favored, and should be favored, on Sunday.  But I estimate the Steelers as only needing about one more break in their favor to defeat the Patriots.  Two big Patriots mistakes and only one big Steelers mistake, for example, is likely in my mind to lead to a Steelers victory. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They'd be very similar.  Realize that for the winner of a three-game series to be different from the winner of the first game in that series, the loser of the first game must sweep the other two games.  That wouldn't happen very often, even with the biggest Conference Championship upsets.

In fact, presumably the three-game series would include one game at the lower seed and two games at the higher seed; when the higher seed lost its game at home in real life, it seems like a tall order for the higher seed to then win both on the road and at home.

I grabbed [this list of one writer's estimation of the ten biggest Conference Championship upsets:](http://www.commdiginews.com/sports/the-10-greatest-conference-title-game-upsets-in-nfl-history-33444/)

* 2005 AFC  Steelers 34, Broncos 17.  That Steelers team was one of the best wild-card teams in NFL history.  The Broncos could sweep two more games, but it seems unlikely.

* 2011 NFC  Giants 20, 49ers 17, OT.  Slightly more likely to change, but again, I still favor the Giants to win one of two more notional games against the 49ers.

* 1975 NFC  Cowboys 17, Vikings 14.  I mean, the Vikings were 12-2, but the 10-4 wild-card Cowboys were no slouch.

* 2007 NFC  Giants 23, Packers 20, OT.  Again, I still favor the Giants to win one of two against an aging Brett Favre.

* 2003 NFC  Panthers 14, Eagles 3.  Donovan McNabb wouldn't suddenly become uninjured in the next two contests.

* 1990 NFC  Giants 15, 49ers 13.  14-2 49ers were a better team, but the 13-3 Bill Parcells Giants, after winning with Jeff Hostetler, would still be favored to keep one of the next two games close enough with their defense to advance.

* 1985 AFC  Patriots 31, Dolphins 14.  Maybe the likeliest so far to change.  Those 1985 Patriots certainly looked horrible in Super Bowl XX.  But they did beat the Dolphins by 17.

* 1998 NFC  Falcons 30, Vikings 27, OT.  Great 15-1 Vikings team, but the 14-2 Falcons would surely be favored at home.

* 2002 NFC  Buccaneers 27, Eagles 10.  It's not like this Buccaneers team would suddenly forget how to play defense.

* 1994 AFC  Chargers 17, Steelers 13.  You should get a non-Steelers fan to evaluate whether this may indeed be the likeliest result of all to change; from my biased perspective, that's what it seems to me.  But even if you advance the Steelers to Super Bowl XXIX, they're going to have a tough time with the 49ers. </TEXT>

Terry Bradshaw: "Can't help you there."

As for the Patriots, I don't expect them to feature all of the following in the AFC Championship game: a fumbled kickoff return; a second fumble; a 15-yard defensive penalty to keep a drive alive; two interceptions; and getting beat deep on defense only to be saved by the opponents dropping a touchdown. </TEXT>

[Opponents started on their own 24.87-yard line, on average, against the Patriots' defense this year!](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/drivestatsdef)  That was the worst opponents' field position, on average, in the league.

<TEXT> Ross Cockrell and Justin Gilbert could both definitely improve their CB play.  Ross Cockrell has played 98% of snaps and has 0 interceptions.  Justin Gilbert was originally drafted eighth overall by the Cleveland Browns; he was a bust there, and the Steelers traded a sixth-round pick to get him.  He needs to start pushing for playing time on defense.

Jarvis Jones has been a bit disappointing at LB.  Ryan Shazier has been a great LB, but needs to stay consistently healthy.  Vince Williams was a good find in the sixth round, but it would be great to see him step up from "career backup" level.

Daniel McCullers has been slowly coming along at DT.  No complaints for a sixth-round pick, but if I were greedy, I'd ask for him to push for playing time as well. </TEXT>

* 11-5, lose first playoff game

* 9-7, lose first playoff game

* 12-4, win first playoff game, lose second playoff game

* 11-5, win first two playoff games, lose Super Bowl

* 10-6, win first playoff game, lose second playoff game

* 11-5, win first playoff game, lose second playoff game

* 7-9, no playoffs

* 6-10, no playoffs

Is it time to let this coach go now?  How about if the next season is:

* 9-7, no playoffs?

Of course, this is Bill Cowher, and after that 9-7 season, the next five seasons are:

* 13-3, win first playoff game, lose second playoff game

* 10-5-1, win first playoff game, lose second playoff game

* 6-10

* 15-1, win first playoff game, lose second playoff game

* 11-5, win three straight playoff games on the road, then win Super Bowl XL </TEXT>

Maybe the Patriots will get to six Super Bowl wins after LII.  In that case, at least the AFC would finally catch up to the NFC again.

<TEXT> I think the Chargers may have let some good coaches go too early.  Disclaimer: I haven't followed the Chargers too closely, and I agree with the conventional wisdom that a coach who "loses the locker room" has to be let go.  So if any of these coaches lost the locker room, my mistake; they did need to be let go.

It seems as if the Chargers didn't want to let Bobby Ross go.  But I consider the firings of Marty Schottenheimer and Norv Turner to be mistakes.

Schottenheimer's playoff record was understandably a concern... but two games is such a small sample size in a league where a bad bounce can change everything.

Norv Turner's last three years: 9-7, 8-8, 7-9.  Compare Bill Cowher, 1998-2000: 7-9, 6-10, 9-7. </TEXT>

That year, the Steelers won their last game and made the playoffs by getting the necessary results from three other games that week, the last of which was on Monday night (thanks Vikings).  In contrast to 2006, though, the Steelers and all three of the other teams they needed to win were all favored. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing to keep in mind is that the Strength of Victory tiebreaker can come into play when teams decide whether to play their starters, even if the final standings don't use the tiebreaker.

For example, this season, suppose that Pittsburgh were to defeat Baltimore, Houston were to defeat Cincinnati, and Oakland were to defeat Indianapolis.  Suppose further that Pittsburgh were to get the combination of other results necessary to clinch the Strength of Victory tiebreaker over Houston: for example, assuming that Oakland were to defeat Indianapolis, Washington defeating Chicago would suffice.

In this scenario, Pittsburgh is locked into the #3 seed.  The Strength of Victory tiebreaker has come into play with one game left in the season.

Now suppose Pittsburgh rests Roethlisberger, Brown, and Bell against Cleveland... but Landry Jones, Fitzgerald Toussaint, and Eli Rogers lead Pittsburgh to victory anyway.  Well, Pittsburgh is then the only 11-5 team in the AFC, so they're not involved in any tiebreakers at the end of the season.  But Strength of Victory nevertheless made a big difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Pittsburgh defeats Baltimore, Pittsburgh hasn't yet clinched the strength-of-victory tiebreaker on Houston, but could do so on Saturday, possibly with help from tonight's result.  If Pittsburgh defeats Baltimore, Pittsburgh would need two and a half good results from the following list to clinch the strength-of-victory tiebreaker over Houston, with a tie counting as half a good result.

Week 16:

* New York Giants defeat Philadelphia.

* Buffalo defeats Miami.

* Washington defeats Chicago.

* Chicago loses to Washington.  Yes, that means that a Washington victory over Chicago counts as two good results for Pittsburgh, not just one; a Washington-Chicago tie counts as one good result, not just one-half; and a Chicago victory over Washington is still zero.

* Cleveland defeats San Diego.

* Jets defeat New England.

* Oakland defeats Indianapolis (which would, however, be fatal to Pittsburgh's outside shot at a #2 seed.)

* Dallas defeats Detroit.


(Obviously, if Houston loses to or ties Cincinnati in Week 16, then Pittsburgh can clinch a better record than Houston by defeating Baltimore.)

If Pittsburgh defeats Baltimore, but hasn't quite received all two and a half or more good results from other games in week 16, and Houston defeats Cincinnati, then even if Pittsburgh loses to Cleveland in week 17 and Houston defeats Tennessee in week 17... Pittsburgh still can add good results from the following list to the previous list to add up to two and a half:

* Green Bay defeats Detroit.

* Indianapolis defeats Jacksonville.

* Minnesota defeats Chicago.

If I made a mistake, /u/NFLPlayoffScenarios can probably catch it. </TEXT>

It's only a partial repayment on the debt, though, because the Steelers are already self-motivated to win, whereas the Bills won in Week 17 last year after having already been eliminated from playoff contention. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  [Reuters reports:](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-papua-quake-idUSKBN1460CF)
The PTWC said tsunami waves were possible in the next three hours along some coasts of not only Papua New Guinea but also Indonesia, the Solomon Islands, Pohnpei, Chuuk, Nauru, Kosrae and Vanuatu.

Just in case you are in the danger zone and reading reddit, here are NOAA's tsunami safety rules.

* A strong earthquake felt in a low-lying coastal area is a natural warning of possible, immediate danger. Keep calm and quickly move to higher ground away from the coast.

*	 Not all large earthquakes cause tsunamis, but many do. If the quake is located near or directly under the ocean, the probability of a tsunami increases. When you hear that an earthquake has occurred under the ocean or coastline regions, prepare for a tsunami emergency.

*	 Tsunamis can occur at any time, day or night. They can travel up rivers and streams that lead to the ocean.

*	 A tsunami is not a single wave, but a series of waves. The largest wave may occur several hours after arrival. Stay out of danger until an "ALL CLEAR" is issued by a competent authority.

*	 Approaching tsunamis are sometimes heralded by noticeable rise or fall of coastal waters. This is nature's tsunami warning and should be heeded.

*	 Approaching large tsunamis are usually accompanied by a loud roar that sounds like a train or aircraft. If a tsunami arrives at night when you can not see the ocean, this is also nature's tsunami warning and should be heeded.

*	 A small tsunami at one beach can be a giant a few miles away. Don't let the modest size of one make you lose respect for all.

*	 Never go down to the beach to watch for a tsunami!
WHEN YOU CAN SEE THE WAVE YOU ARE TOO CLOSE TO ESCAPE.
Tsunamis can move faster than a person can run!

*	 During a tsunami emergency, your local emergency management office, police, fire and other emergency organizations will try to save your life. Give them your fullest cooperation.

*	 Homes and other buildings located in low lying coastal areas are not safe. Do NOT stay in such buildings if there is a tsunami warning.

*	 The upper floors of high, multi-story, reinforced concrete hotels can provide refuge if there is no time to quickly move inland or to higher ground.

*	 If you are on a boat or ship, weather and time-permitting, move your vessel to deeper water (at least 150 feet). If it is the case that there is concurrent severe weather, it may may safer to leave the boat at the pier and physically move to higher ground.

*	 Damaging wave activity and unpredictable currents can effect harbor conditions for a period of time after the tsunami's initial impact. Be sure conditions are safe before you return your boat or ship to the harbor.

*	 Stay tuned to your local radio, marine radio, NOAA Weather Radio, or television stations during a tsunami emergency - bulletins issued through your local emergency management office and National Weather Service offices can save your life. </TEXT>

One that leaps to mind is two participants in the AZT double-blind trial, one who turned out to be receiving AZT and one who turned out to be in the placebo control group, splitting half of their pills with each other.  When there were literally no other treatments for AIDS, taking half of two pills -- that the patients couldn't distinguish from one another, except that one set of pills was prescribed to one patient and another set of pills to the other patient -- ended up giving both patients a dose of AZT, albeit a dose reduced by half. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1a) Clinton gets into the White House, Democrats take over the Senate, and the Democratic long-shot House takeover comes through.  Bernie and other progressives are critical constituents in legislation getting through Congress.

1b) Clinton gets into the White House, Democrats take over the Senate, but Democrats miss out on the House, although they narrow the Republican majority.  Bernie and other progressives are key players, although balanced by House Republicans.  Bernie and other progressives in the Senate are critical constituents of Senate-only votes, such as confirming federal judges and Supreme Court justices.

1c) Clinton gets into the White House, but Republicans maintain control of both houses of Congress.  Bernie and other progressives are relatively unimportant.

Dear fellow progressives: strongly consider voting for those downballot Democratsprogressive, centrist, or otherwisein the House and the Senate too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is the total capacity of all incoming forms of transportation to the USA?  Road, rail, ports, airplanes.  How many orders of magnitude is it below 650,000,000 per week?

I ignore walking.  I suppose you could try to line up 650,000,000 people along the US-Canada border and the smaller US-Mexico border, but you've just pushed the question a few feet away: how do all those people get there in the first place?

The video does demonstrate Trump's Russian ties, and raises questions with no good answers, like: did Trump perform in the music video as a favor to a Russian oligarch, or for pay, or did Trump pay to appear?  Any of the possible explanations would appear to be unsettling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm trying to find a science fiction short story.  In this tale, the original embossed copy of the Declaration of Independence at the National Archives is replaced with a fake. The perpetrator, I think, proves that it's a fake by asking the archivist to check the spelling of "British" in "British brethren"; the fake says "British", and the real one has the misspelling "Brittish" (as it does in real life).  Maybe Asimov wrote it, but I'm not sure.  Ideas? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [USA] Fun with Article V of the U.S. Constitution and Senate representation </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-19 23:15:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, location bot, I'm in the USA.  **THE WHOLE USA.**

Article V describes the process of amending the U.S. Constitution, and contains this proviso:
no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.

In a discussion, redditor /u/da5id1 suggested these workarounds for the proviso.  I'm interested in the perspective of/r/legaladvice:

* Amend Article V to delete this proviso.  Then, and only then, amend the constitution to deprive small states of equal suffrage in the Senate.  Or...

* Amend the Constitution to abolish the Senate.  Each state would have equal suffrage: zero senators!

I am more interested in discussing the legalities of these workarounds, and less interested in their moral or ethical virtues or principles, or lack thereof.  Yes, I understand the various *raisons d'tre* of the Senate, including not only providing checks and balances for the House, but also explicitly protecting the interests of small states.  I'm just looking for a fun legal discussion. </TEXT>

As you may have heard, Gygax Magazine has been in a trademark dispute, which we're glad to have settled. However, Luke   Ernie Gygax have decided to withdraw for business reasons. We're all still good friends and support each other, but as a result, we've decided that we will no longer publish Gygax Magazine.  Without any Gygaxes involved, it wouldn't be right to continue it. This was a very difficult decision, and we're so sorry to have to see it end. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Glorious nation of Kazakhstan... could put Turkey in Euro 2016?! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-12 02:03:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Consider this scenario. Spain gets at least a draw in Ukraine on Monday. On Tuesday, Turkey wins at home against Iceland. Turkey finishes third in Group A with 18 points. Will Turkey be the best third-place team, and qualify directly to Euro 2016, skipping the playoffs?

Well, it all depends on Kazakhstan! If Kazakhstan wins in Latvia on Tuesday, Latvia drops to sixth place in Group A, and Turkey's two draws against Latvia are ignored. Turkey would have 16 points against the first-, second-, fourth-, and fifth-place teams in their group. No other third-place team would have as many points (again, subject to the assumption that Ukraine doesn't defeat Spain), and so Turkey would qualify directly.

If there is no such win for Kazakhstan in Latvia, only potato -- a draw or a loss -- then Kazakhstan would be the sixth-place team in Group A. Because Turkey beat Kazakhstan twice, Turkey would have only 12 points against the other teams in the group. Hungary would be the lucky loser and Turkey would face a play-off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In May of 1986, there was a massive one-time coast-to-coast fundraising event in the USA, for the benefit of the hungry, homeless, and poor. Over six million people participated, although the event was somewhat controversial for some of its omissions. Here are some lyrics from the theme song from that event: "...across this land I love, divided we fall, united we stand..."

<TEXT> Just a suggestion: add a page on ChangeTip.com that functions as follows.  I select a place I'm going to ChangeTip (perhaps reddit, perhaps Twitter, or somewhere else).  I put in some text.  ChangeTip then tells me that if I were to tip on that place with that text, the resulting tip would be X bits or Y dollars (or, in the case of "roulette" or "flip" or "roll", the range of the random amount.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> iPad (first generation, 32GB, WiFi + 3G) battery replacement saga, part three (conclusion) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-05 00:36:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Part one is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/2ni95o/ipad_first_generation_32gb_wifi_3g_battery/)  [Part two is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/2o71e4/ipad_first_generation_32gb_wifi_3g_battery/)

I was pleasantly surprised by a call from the Apple Store today to let me know that the replacement iPad had arrived just one day after the service call.  I went in with my old iPad.  The Apple Store technicians restored the replacement iPad to its factory settings (which might have been redundant), moved the SIM card from the old iPad to the replacement iPad, and got me started on restoring from my iCloud backup.  Once the iPad moved to the final stage of restoring -- namely, re-downloading my purchases -- I went back to the office and let it finish there.  All seems to be well so far; I've only had to re-enter some WiFi passwords.  I'm typing on the replacement iPad now.

My use cases and financial situation do indeed make it worthwhile for me to spend $99 on a battery replacement in a first-generation iPad.  Thanks for all the support, especially from /u/Hrhnick. </TEXT>

Because of the comment from /u/Hrhnick in that thread, I went back to the Apple Store for battery replacement again.  **They again tried to charge me $249!**  But thanks to /u/Hrhnick, I was armed with [this link to Apple's website](https://www.apple.com/support/ipad/repair/battery-power/), showing that it should be only $99 ([this link may also be useful](http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=servicefaq geo=United_States product=ipad)).  The Genius Bar employee went to discuss my contention with other employees and finally came back, agreeing that it should be $99.

The replacement iPad should arrive in five to ten business days, and I'll update then.  Of note is that I have performed an iCloud backup of my iPad, for obvious reasons.  I have also turned off "Find My iPad" based on directions I received from Apple in the process of setting up my Genius Bar appointment. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My four-year-old first-generation iPad (32GB, WiFi + 3G, received as a gift) has been having severe battery issues recently, and the Apple diagnostics agreed with me that it needed a battery replacement.  I made a Genius Bar appointment and took it in to the Apple Store only to find that they wanted $249 for the privilege!  I'd get an entire identical reconditioned first-generation iPad for my trouble, but what's the point of that?

I have a lead on a possible third-party repair shop that will replace the battery much more cheaply -- will update as the saga continues. </TEXT>

Bits for Americanisms tossed around at my whim.  Giveaway is open until it's closed.

<TITLE> Guess the country for 500 bits, plus other 100-bit bonuses </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-19 15:06:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night I went to a restaurant to get carryout food for dinner.  This was the first time that I had eaten this particular dish, and it was delicious.  This dish is associated with one specific country of origin: guess the country for 500 bits.

In each round, one guess per person.  Along with your guess, please submit a question that you'd like me to answer to give everyone a hint for the next round.  Each question I choose gets a bonus of 100 bits.

Round 1 begins with no hints... now!

Edit: Round 2 begins with the hint that the country is **not** in Asia... now!

Edit: Round 3 begins with the first ingredient hint for the dish -- egg -- now!

Edit: Here's another ingredient hint -- chicken.  Let's hope for the next hint to be about the country itself.  Round 4 begins now!

Edit: We've found out that it's a Northern Hemisphere country; let's hope to learn more about it in Round 5, which begins now!

Edit: We've found out that the country is **not** in Europe -- Round 6 begins now!

Edit: The country is a democracy, on to Round 7!

Edit: The country is "little", that is, it is **not** one of the largest 90 countries in the world by area; on to Round 8!

Edit: We've learned that, in addition to chicken and egg, an ingredient of the dish was a large, thick wheat-flour pancake -- on to Round 9!

Edit: We've learned that one color of the country's flag is a shade of blue -- on to Round 10!

Edit: We've learned that there is only one other color on the country's flag -- on to Round 11!

Edit: Finally, in Round 11, /u/va243 successfully guessed Honduras.  The dish was [baleadas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleada), large, thick wheat-flour tortillas filled with mashed fried beans -- and, in this particular case, chicken, egg, avocado, and crumbled cheese. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-11-13 18:58:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two reasons for this thread:

* I had a tip not go through, with the message "Tip Delivery Bug" on ChangeTip.com; on mouseover, the pop-up "There was a problem on our side delivering the tip" appeared.  Your website might automatically report these to you, but in case it doesn't, I wanted you to know.

* The error message should tell me whether I need to re-tip or not to get the tip to go through.  I did re-tip (and if the tippee gets two tips, I'll live), but doing that was just an educated guess on my part.  Edited to add: It turns out that I didn't need to re-tip, so the tippee indeed got two tips. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My two personal problems with Bitcoin: laziness and lack of trust </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-10 22:52:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here are my two personal problems with Bitcoin.  

* I'm lazy, so I don't want to go through a lot of work to manage my own Bitcoin holdings personally.  

* Even though I have a lot of faith in people in general, I'm slow to trust in, well, the trustworthiness of every single necessary person involved in managing my Bitcoin holdings for me.  For liquid holdings in U.S. dollars, I don't have to trust anyone except the FDIC and the NCUA.  ChangeTip is great, and I have no reason to think that they represent anything other than the best of humanity, but I'd still be a little leery of storing large quantities there.  

I'm not sure if other people have the same problems, but for people who are interested in overcoming barriers to Bitcoin adoption, this is one example of the barriers Bitcoin faces. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Research for me: who suggested that you only need to say the Pledge of Allegiance once? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-06 15:29:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Somewhere on the Internet within the last couple of months -- could have been reddit, Slashdot, or elsewhere -- someone made the following point.  If you pledge allegiance to the flag of the USA once, you shouldn't ever need to do so again, because your pledge is still in effect.  Yet many schoolchildren in the USA -- including myself, way back when -- recite the Pledge of Allegiance every week or even every day.

I can't find the place where I first read this idea; if you find it, then I'll tip you 500 bits.  If you find another place where this idea was mentioned (before the creation of this thread), but it doesn't happen to be the first place I read it, then I'll tip you 100 bits (maximum of five such tips, and doesn't apply after someone claims the 500 bits). </TEXT>
