<TEXT> Republicans are now trying to claim the single measure for judging whether a health care plan is good is whether or not it lowers insurance premiums. Forget the 100 line items they used to bury the ACA ("job killer", "death panels", etc.). Republicans are pretty good at distracting their base. Will they fall for it again? </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Although the White House claims that it fired Comey over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clintons emails, the presidents letter to Comey didnt mention that investigation, instead mentioning the probe into Trumps ties with Russia. Even there, the language of the letter  particularly the part where Trump writes that I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.  strongly suggests that the goal here was for the president to exonerate himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this part:

  More likely to have provoked the president was Comeys recent congressional testimony, in which he said that it made him nauseous to think his actions affected the election results. This remark likely hit President Trumps most sensitive nerve. Anything that strikes at the legitimacy of his election is destabilizing to the president. He is insecure and seems to feel that his hold on his office is tenuous. Thats why reminders that he lost the popular vote make him apoplectic.  </TEXT>
