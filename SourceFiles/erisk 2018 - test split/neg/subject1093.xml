<TEXT> Thanks for posting to /r/DIY!

Your post has been removed because it links to an unapproved domain. While links to other domains are permitted here, they do require moderator review.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

You have a couple of options:

1. If you are submitting a completed project that meets the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines), and you made the project yourself, you may message the moderators to request that your post be manually reviewed.

2. If you are asking for help with a specific aspect of a DIY project, and are linking to a website to explain your problem, please use the [Submit a Help Request](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/submit?selftext=true) link instead. Include the link to the website in the text of the post, and also include additional context and details so that others may help you more easily.

3. If you're asking a question that doesn't meet the "specific question about an *aspect* of a DIY project" requirement, such as "how can I fix the problem shown in this website" or "how can I make the project shown in this website", such posts generally do not meet the help request requirements in our [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines). Consider asking your question in the [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY, rather than creating a new post.

Remember that all posts are required to meet the posting guidelines. We encourage you to read the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines) for more information.

If you believe your link meets the posting requirements, please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDIY message=Please%20review%20my%20non-Imgur%20submission%20at%20https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/6ac3pj/homemade_greeting_card_and_crafts_tutorial/).

If you're trying to post a product/promotion, or trying to drive traffic to your website, please see [reddit's spam rules here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F), and if you fall into that category, please go somewhere else.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ac3m2/men_of_reddit_do_you_really_think_money_is_a_big/).

## Purchase Guides

# Visit [/r/headphones' Purchase Assistants](https://sites.google.com/view/quipa/assistants). 

The tools include more than 150 In-Ear, Full-size and On-Ear headphone recommendations, as well as DACs and Amps for desktop and portable use.

**Gaming Headphones**: Read [this](http://www.head-fi.org/t/534479/mad-lust-envys-headphone-gaming-guide-updated-9-2-2013-sony-ma900-added) head-fi post.

**Budget Headphones**: Take a look at these guides; [$30](/r/headphones/comments/uywzz/guide_what_should_i_buy_if_i_have_30/) and [$50](/r/headphones/comments/v0xbu/guide_what_should_i_buy_if_i_have_50/)

[This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AvER-WhtgCFjdEpldTBWSVFLeG5pX3ZOcnFDVXdOdVE rm=full#gid=0) summarizes data from the headphone guide in a sortable/searchable format.

## Before Requesting Purchase Advice

Using [this template](/r/headphones/wiki/purchaseadvice) helps others answer your question.  Often questions without enough detail will go unanswered.

Remember that the more specific you are, the better quality the responses you are likely to receive.

After asking a question, please have some patience as responders may not always be immediately available.

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music

<TITLE> Day 1? Starting your weight loss journey on Wednesday, 10 May 2017? Start here! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 13:07:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Today is your Day 1?**

**Welcome to r/Loseit!**

So you arent sure of how to start?  Dont worry!  How do I get started? is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that weve found most useful for getting started.

#Why youre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

#Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

#Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so dont cheat the numbers.  Youll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

#Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what youre eating you wont stick to it.

#Exercise

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has its own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel *awesome* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

#Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isnt necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

#Acceptance

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We dont need perfect.  We just want better.

Now youre ready to do this.  Here are more details, that may help you refine your plan.

<TEXT> In accordance with Rule 8, this is another reminder to ESSers to remain civil to your fellow ESSers, even if there's a difference of opinion. Don't escalate debates into abusive arguments. E.g. "Well you're fucking wrong and stupid" and "So you believe that? You must be a insert disgusting word."

Violations of this rule will be met with a warning, a temporary ban or a permanent ban, depending on the circumstances.

If any abuse is directed to you by a fellow ESSer, report it to the mods and we will investigate.

Thank you for your cooperation and fuck Bernie Sanders.

Acquaint yourself with the rules on the sidebar before commenting or posting. Rules are strictly enforced for non subscribers.


- Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. 


- **Bigotry, ableism and hate speech will be met with immediate bans;** socialism is an intrinsically inclusive system and we believe all people are born equal and deserve equal voices in society. 

- This subreddit is not for questioning the basics of socialism.  There are numerous subreddits available for those who wish to debate or learn more about socialism


- Users are expected to at least read the discussion in a given thread before replying to it.  Obviously obtuse or asinine questions will be assumed to be trolling and will be removed and can result in a ban.

<TEXT> Hello /u/janKhut! It looks like you're trying to post a direct image, or something that might not be the original source, to /r/dataisbeautiful. **I've removed the current thread,** since you're probably trying to do one of three things. Let me help you with posting...

---

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [complete original source article](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization *where it was originally introduced* by the author (not an image on the site, but **the actual full web page article**). [More information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Need+help+finding+the+original+source message=I+need+help+finding+the+original+source+of+this+image:).
        
---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Resubmit your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. subject1093 will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_plagiarism.3F) in this subreddit. No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.
        
---

##If the original source is a PDF:

*Leave your post as-is* and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Exception+for+PDF message=I+need+an+exception+for+this+post:%0A%0AOriginal+PDF:). We'll make an exception for you. In your modmail message, be sure to include the original PDF.

Your post will be manually approved by the mod team, and we'll sticky the original PDF to the top of the comment thread so our readers can get context.

<TITLE> /r/FIFA: The Weekly Bitch/Brag Pack Thread </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's not that we don't care that you got something good in your pack. It's just that we don't care enough to scroll all day to find out. 

If you got something good, brag it up in here. 

If you want to know what to do with it, ask away. 

If you're about to commit pack suicides, write your goodbye letter here.

If you literally burned through all your coins and ended up with nothing... welcome to the club.

**Let us live vicariously through your mistakes or your insane good luck... IMAGES are highly encouraged!**

<TITLE> Weekly Self-Promotion Thread - May 10, 2017 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 13:06:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Self-promotion (ie posting about projects/businesses that you operate and can profit from) is typically a practice that is discouraged in /r/financialindependence, and these posts are removed through moderation.  This is a thread where those rules *do not* apply. **However**, please do not post referral links in this thread. 

Use this thread to talk about your blog, talk about your business, ask for feedback, etc. If the self-promotion starts to leak outside of this thread, we will once again return to a time where 100% of self-promotion posts are banned. Please use this space wisely. 

**Link-only posts will be removed. Put some effort into it.**     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

---

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

While the Rules for posting questions on the basics of personal finance/investing topics are relaxed a little bit here, the rules against memes/spam/self-promotion/excessive rudeness/politics still apply!

Have a look at the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/faq) for this subreddit before posting to see if your question is frequently asked.

<TEXT> [](/user/Maninahouse)Your submission has been automatically removed.

This seems to have occurred because it is not a direct link to a single image, or it is not hosted on an image hosting site. 

**READ BELOW BEFORE MESSAGING THE MODS ABOUT THIS REMOVAL.  THIS IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE REASON.**

**If you did submit to imgur and this was removed, you most likely linked to an imgur page and not to the .jpg of the image itself.  Please double check this, 99% of the time this is the issue.  If you are using RES, it automatically fills in .jpg when you look at the link, but most of the time it actually isn't there.**

The URL of your submission needs to end with .jpg, .jpeg or .png, and it should be hosted on an image hosting site, such as [imgur](http://imgur.com) or [minus](http://minus.com). If you are submitting an image, then please be considerate of mobile and RES users, and resubmit your post as a direct link.

For your convenience, here is your submitted link with a .jpg file extension appended to the end. Please check that it works. If it does, retry your submission with this link:

http://picsagain.com/charlie-chaplin-1918/.jpg

If the above link does not work, right-click on your image, select *Copy Image URL*, and paste that into the reddit submission page.

<TEXT> Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. We just want to remind you of some important rules:

1. No trading of hacked, cloned, or illegal Pokmon. Definitions of these terms can be found in the [legitimacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/policy).
2. Do not trade valuable Pokmon of uncertain legitimacy. That includes Pokmon obtained from Wonder Trade, the GTS, and passerby trades, and may also include trades on other websites or with friends.
3. [Full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) must be posted when offering any shiny, event, or competitive legendary Pokmon.

If your post violates any of these rules, please edit it as appropriate, and [read the rules **in full**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) before posting again. Otherwise, your post will be removed by a moderator.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 
What Card Should I Get Weekly Thread, where we try to figure out what card you should get or  critique your current plans or AOR if you're doing it that way). Everything is YMMV and these are all opinions. Agree or disagree with your votes. As always ***read the wiki, do your research***, and happy churning.

Also, check out the [Credit Card Recommendation Flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/5wsvzr/faq_credit_card_recommendation_flowchart/) before posting in this thread.  

[Current crowd source best offers. Please be mindful to double check if it is indeed the current best offer.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-O7cxABDN1EGwBn8KXIm4ZZVXA88SVfmv2w4NIIyYvg/edit?pli=1)

1. What is your credit score?

1. What cards do you currently have? For better results also add the date you were approved for the cards.

1. Are you targeting points, Companion Passes, hotel or airline statuses, First Class, Biz, Economy seating(s) or cash back?

1. What point/miles do you currently have?

1. What is the airport you're flying out of?

1. Where would you like to go?  (The More specific you are, the better someone can recommend the right card.  Tokyo is great, "International travel" is way too vague)

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ac2nu/is_the_isle_of_man_a_country/).

Use this thread to advertise your desire to party with other players, recruit for your team, find missed connections, advertise your Discord/voice servers or link your Twitch stream (include streaming times)! Be proactive and reach out to others who have posted here!

Included below is an *optional* form you can copy/paste into your post:

    **Username or team name?** (Player ID - NOT individual character names.)

    **What Ship?**  

    **What time zone or general area of the world?**

    **Play style?** 

    **What are you searching for?**

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

Have you hit a brick wall? Did you discover that people on Ancestry created an unnecessarily complicated mess by merging three individuals who happened to have the same name, making it exceptionally time-consuming to sort out who was YOUR ancestor? Is there a close relative you discovered via genetic genealogy who refuses to respond to your contact requests?

Vent your frustrations here, and commiserate with your fellow researchers over shared misery.

<TEXT> Hey there! Your post has been removed because you did not include a correct tag at the **beginning** of your title. Without this, I'm not able to assign the appropriate flair. Please re-submit your post with one of the following tags in the title.

Your post will also be removed if the title is in all caps or if there are less than 2 words in the title (not including the tag). Please be sure to use a descriptive title.

If you're unsure of what tag to use, then [Question] or [Discussion] would probably work for most borderline cases. Thanks!

Tag | Usage
:--|:--
[Release] | New tweaks that have just been released or submitted
[Update] | Existing tweaks that have just been updated
[Beta] | Tweaks currently in beta
[Upcoming] | Tweaks currently in development
[News] | Tweak and jailbreak related news
[Discussion] | Jailbreak related discussions where anyone can give their opinion. For example, favorite/recommended tweaks, tweak concepts, tweak configurations, etc.
[Question] or [Help]| Troubleshooting jailbreak or tweak related issues and questions
[Request] | Requests for a tweak to be made or updated
[Tutorial] | How-to posts
[Meta] | Posts about /r/jailbreak itself
[Giveaway] | Theme or tweak giveaways
[Tip] | Shorter how-to posts

**NOTE: ** If you wish to use multiple tags, please do not "split" your tags like this: `[Question/Discussion]`. They should be separate like this: `[Question] [Discussion]`.

For more information, please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/38uktc/meta_link_flair_system/)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses "()" or braces "{}" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only "[W]" but not also "[H]" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Please also take this time to [examine our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/rules) for future reference.

If you intend to contact us about this action (or any other ones), please ensure that you have read this comment in its entirety (making sure to read through any relevant links) and make sure you grasp a full understanding of what it means *before* contacting us.

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ac287/do_any_of_you_actually_not_believe_in_evolution/).

<TEXT> Hi arkonum, your submission has been removed due to your use of "animes". "Anime" is the proper plural of "anime".

The reason for this removal is to prevent the derailing of discussion and harassment of submitters for incorrect grammar usage.

Feel free to fix the problem and message the mods for reapproval. If it was used in a title, you must resubmit the post.

Preferred sites are: [soundcloud](//soundcloud.com), [bandcamp](//bandcamp.com), [youtube](//youtube.com], [vimeo](vimeo.com), and [spotify](//spotify.com).  These work best with reddit's embedding feature.  It is *highly unlikely* that you'll be unable to find the content you're trying to submit on these sites.

Please ensure that you have searched for the artist on each of our preferred sites before contacting us.

If this stream is a bandcamp or soundcloud link that is being embedded in the artist's home page, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/listentothis subject=Bandcamp or Soundcloud on Artist's Website!) to request manual approval.

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

<TEXT> Hello comrades! As a friendly reminder, this subreddit is a space for socialists.  If you have questions or want to debate, please consider the subs created specifically for this (/r/Socialism_101, /r/SocialismVCapitalism, /r/CapitalismVSocialism, or /r/DebateCommunism/).  You are also encouraged to use the search function to search for topics you may not be well versed in, as they may have been covered extensively before.  Acquaint yourself with the rules on the sidebar before commenting or posting. Rules are strictly enforced for non subscribers.


- Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. 


- **Bigotry, ableism and hate speech will be met with immediate bans;** socialism is an intrinsically inclusive system and we believe all people are born equal and deserve equal voices in society. 

- This subreddit is not for questioning the basics of socialism.  There are numerous subreddits available for those who wish to debate or learn more about socialism


- Users are expected to at least read the discussion in a given thread before replying to it.  Obviously obtuse or asinine questions will be assumed to be trolling and will be removed and can result in a ban.

New to socialism?

- Check out the **Socialism Starter Pack** - https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/index/starterpack

Thank you!

<TEXT> Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/kikpals because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

These work best with reddit's embedding feature.  It is *highly unlikely* that you'll be unable to find the content you're trying to submit on these sites.

Please ensure that you have searched for the artist on each of our preferred sites before contacting us.

If this stream is a bandcamp or soundcloud link that is being embedded in the artist's home page, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/listentothis subject=Bandcamp or Soundcloud on Artist's Website!) to request manual approval.

Unfortunately it has been removed because it must be a direct image link. **If your imgur submission is an imgur album with multiple images, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcrappydesign) so we can approve it manually.**

**PLEASE NOTE THAT, IF YOU USE AN APP, SUCH AS REDDIT IS FUN, TO UPLOAD YOUR IMAGE, YOU WILL NEED TO USE A DIFFERENT APP OR THE MOBILE WEBSITE TO UPLOAD YOUR IMAGE AND SUBMIT YOUR POST.**  Some apps, mainly Reddit Is Fun, incorrectly upload single images as albums.  You can report this issue to the developer of the app you're using (/r/redditisfun, for the biggest offender).

Otherwise, please re-submit using a direct image link (must end in jpg, gif, png, etc), thanks. [These instructions might help.](http://i.imgur.com/RjrqakK.gifv)  

Or see if one of these links works:

* http://imgur.com/a/D2xOG.jpg
* http://imgur.com/a/D2xOG.gifv

Also, if your link ends in ?1 please remove that before submitting.  


Thanks for understanding! Stay crappy. 3

<TEXT> Hello /u/freespinmania,

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

<TITLE> Daily Accountability Thread - May 10, 2017 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 12:52:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone! This is the Accountability Thread where people can list what they need or want to accomplish today and have everyone else help keep you accountable to do them. So, in general a post will look like this:

Things I have to get done today:

~~1: Post Accountability Thread~~

If I had more to do that I had not completed I would list them and update this when these things were   complete.

Also, if I saw someone doing something that I happen to be well-educated or have some sort of expertise in I can offer support or help on the topic/task.

The thread is a versatile one, use it in a way that helps you and others stay on task!

Happy studying! </TEXT>

Because your account is new (under 10 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.
This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/cats requires all accounts to be at least **10 days old** AND have **at least 25 comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have less than 25 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.
Questions? [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcats) and let us know.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ac0m9/do_you_store_things_in_your_bra/).

## Rule 2: Technical Support, VAC Bans, or Trade Bans

 The subreddit is NOT for technical support, you can ask for assistance in our Weekly Support Thread (Usually stickied at the top) but you are not permitted to post it as a thread on the subreddit.
 
 You should contact Steam Support if you have any personal issues. (e.g. Game bans, trade issues, scams) - **Nobody on this sub can assist with these issues.**
 
 Please check [Steam Status](http://steamstat.us) about issues with Steam servers or services, don't post asking about it.

Please ensure you have read [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/steam/about/rules).

**TIP:** Have you tried [Searching the Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/search) for your issue? It's likely someone has experience and resolved the problem before.

**TIP:** We have a [Weekly Support Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/about/sticky) where you can ask other users for help on your technical support issues.

<TEXT> PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE MESSAGE BEFORE MESSAGING THE MODTEAM.
Because your account is new (under 10 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.
This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/cats requires all accounts to be at least **10 days old** AND have **at least 25 comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have less than 25 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.
Questions? [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcats) and let us know.

<TEXT> Hey /u/chugopunk! Thank you for your submission!    

Unfortunately it has been removed because it must be a direct image link. **If your imgur submission is an imgur album with multiple images, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcrappydesign) so we can approve it manually.**

**PLEASE NOTE THAT, IF YOU USE AN APP, SUCH AS REDDIT IS FUN, TO UPLOAD YOUR IMAGE, YOU WILL NEED TO USE A DIFFERENT APP OR THE MOBILE WEBSITE TO UPLOAD YOUR IMAGE AND SUBMIT YOUR POST.**  Some apps, mainly Reddit Is Fun, incorrectly upload single images as albums.  You can report this issue to the developer of the app you're using (/r/redditisfun, for the biggest offender).

Otherwise, please re-submit using a direct image link (must end in jpg, gif, png, etc), thanks. [These instructions might help.](http://i.imgur.com/RjrqakK.gifv)  

Or see if one of these links works:

* https://imgur.com/P5iP4pa.jpg
* https://imgur.com/P5iP4pa.gifv

Also, if your link ends in ?1 please remove that before submitting.  


Thanks for understanding! Stay crappy. 3

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abzc6/short_story_of_your_success/).

<TITLE> Official Weekly RAW Editing Challenge! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 12:38:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **The Official Weekly RAW Editing Challenge!**

***

Every week, we post a new RAW file for you to edit - you can download this file via the link at the bottom of this post. After you have made all the edits you wish, post a link to your final edit in this thread so other users can view/critique it and upvote their favourite edits. The winner is the user with most upvotes by the end of the week.

The winner can send us one of their photos to be used in next week's competition.

***

**Rules:**

* All RAW files in these threads will be released under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** (See rules in the sidebar.)

* Links in your comment must lead directly to your submission.

* If you enter the competition, you must be willing to provide a RAW file for next week's competition. The moderators will message you if this is the case.

* If you enter the competition, you must vote on other people's entries.

* Don't downvote everyone else in a thread or use bots/fake accounts to upvote yourself or the moderators might **shadowban** you.

This thread will be in **contest mode** until the end of the week. This means submissions will not display in any particular order.

***

**This week's RAW file:**

(DNG link) (Preview link)


**Note from the photographer:**

"Got a DSLR recently and etc... Please credit me as etc..."

***

**Note:**

If there is no link to a RAW file, the moderators are still waiting for a file from last week's winner and will update this post as soon as one is available. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music

<TEXT> Hello /u/novostroyod,

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

<TEXT> Hello, Your post appears to be too vague and breaks Rule 6 (and possibly others) of /r/mildlyinteresting and has been removed. Your title must be a concise description of the content. No jokes, backstories or other fluff. "This was inside my car" or "The way this door opens" are unacceptable. It should act as a "spoiler" for the image. If it leaves the viewer surprised in some way after viewing, it will be removed. [Read about rule 6 in more detail here or in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/21p15y/rule_6_for_dummies/). Still unsure? Feel free to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmildlyinteresting) with a link to this post for a detailed explanation.

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music

<TEXT> We changed our name to r/POTUSWatch a week ago, that was because we decided we're going to track President Donald Trump's successors too and because other subs have refused to help us due to our name containing the word "Trump" so we didn't really have much choice. We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses "()" or braces "{}" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only "[W]" but not also "[H]" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Please also take this time to [examine our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/rules) for future reference.

If you intend to contact us about this action (or any other ones), please ensure that you have read this comment in its entirety (making sure to read through any relevant links) and make sure you grasp a full understanding of what it means *before* contacting us.

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

<TEXT> Hello /u/Tinderium! It looks like you're trying to post a direct image, or something that might not be the original source, to /r/dataisbeautiful. **I've removed the current thread,** since you're probably trying to do one of three things. Let me help you with posting...

---

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [complete original source article](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization *where it was originally introduced* by the author (not an image on the site, but **the actual full web page article**). [More information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Need+help+finding+the+original+source message=I+need+help+finding+the+original+source+of+this+image:).
        
---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Resubmit your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. subject1093 will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_plagiarism.3F) in this subreddit. No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.
        
---

##If the original source is a PDF:

*Leave your post as-is* and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Exception+for+PDF message=I+need+an+exception+for+this+post:%0A%0AOriginal+PDF:). We'll make an exception for you. In your modmail message, be sure to include the original PDF.

Your post will be manually approved by the mod team, and we'll sticky the original PDF to the top of the comment thread so our readers can get context.

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

<TEXT> We're sorry, but the title of your post is in violation of our rules. You had "[W] 171 keys [85.5% sa qs" in your title.

You must set a realistic price or a specific item for which you would instantly trade for every item you buy, sell, or trade here. You must state a specific skin (e.g. Gut Vanilla) that you are looking for. You may still ask for offers. If you have set a buyout and your post is still being removed, please resubmit with a different title.
    
New items added to the game won't require such a price (therefore you can ask for offers in this case), but only until one week after the first set of those items become tradable (CST/CDT will be the time zone used to determine when this window ends). If you were trying to do this, and you feel this removal was an error, please contact us at the link given below after this message.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title - *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).


Thanks! :D

<TEXT> Hello, Your post appears to be too vague and breaks Rule 6 (and possibly others) of /r/mildlyinteresting and has been removed. Your title must be a concise description of the content. No jokes, backstories or other fluff. "This was inside my car" or "The way this door opens" are unacceptable. It should act as a "spoiler" for the image. If it leaves the viewer surprised in some way after viewing, it will be removed. [Read about rule 6 in more detail here or in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/21p15y/rule_6_for_dummies/). Still unsure? Feel free to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmildlyinteresting) with a link to this post for a detailed explanation.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abxfc/wired_place_for_getting_boner/).

Because your account is new (under 10 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.
This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/cats requires all accounts to be at least **10 days old** AND have **at least 25 comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have less than 25 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.

<TEXT> Hello /u/I-am-not-very-smart! It looks like you're trying to post a direct image, or something that might not be the original source, to /r/dataisbeautiful. **I've removed the current thread,** since you're probably trying to do one of three things. Let me help you with posting...

---

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [complete original source article](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization *where it was originally introduced* by the author (not an image on the site, but **the actual full web page article**). [More information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Need+help+finding+the+original+source message=I+need+help+finding+the+original+source+of+this+image:).
        
---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Resubmit your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. subject1093 will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_plagiarism.3F) in this subreddit. No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.
        
---

##If the original source is a PDF:

*Leave your post as-is* and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Exception+for+PDF message=I+need+an+exception+for+this+post:%0A%0AOriginal+PDF:). We'll make an exception for you. In your modmail message, be sure to include the original PDF.

Your post will be manually approved by the mod team, and we'll sticky the original PDF to the top of the comment thread so our readers can get context.

<TEXT> Your submission has been automatically removed because it only has a title and little to none self text.   
When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. For example: When submitting a question you can expand on what motivated you to ask the question, reasearch you already did and things you already know about the subject. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion.

Hey /u/harry26902, thank you for your submission in /r/Rainbow6!

Unfortunately, because your account is new (under 2 hours old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.

This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/Rainbow6 requires all accounts to be at least **2 hours old** AND have **positive comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have negative comment karma, it is easy to raise it  simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title - *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).


Thanks! :D

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

<TEXT> But can we at least dispel the myth that Barack Obama doesn't know what he is doing? Because I, for one, believe he knows exactly what he's doing. I'm not sure if anyone else gets the sense that he is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, but it seems to me that he knows exactly what he is doing. So let's, once and for all, dispel this myth that Barack Obama doesn't know what he is doing. He knows exactly what he is doing.

<TEXT> /u/georgewillson818

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abwhy/hiring_managers_of_reddit_do_you_care_if_people/).

<TEXT> Your post has been removed because we are asked a lot of questions about TV License and the answers are always the same.

[Here's a search run for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/search?q=TV+License restrict_sr=on)

[Link to TV License website](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/)

If your question is **not about:**

- Whether you should pay
- If what you watch attracts TV License (Watching live/on iPlayer)
- How you watch (online/TV/Freeview/Satelite)
- Enforcement (what happens if you don't/can't/won't pay)
- Refunds
- What channels to watch with TV License
- What's the point of paying
- What does TV License pay for
- Does my room at University need TV License (if you watch it in your room only, then yes it does)
- Does my rented room/flat need one (if you have an HMO contract, your room needs one, or a single one for a TV in a communal location)
- Anything else found on search or on the FAQ
- Not listed on the [TV License website](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/)
then [click here to message a mod](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=AskUK subject=Please review my post about TV Licensing message=https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/6abwga/temporary_tv_licence/), and we'll review your post.

If you post something on reddit and someone asks for a citation on that there information that you posted then you should be able to fucking find that piece of information. I thought it was very fucking obvious that the piece of information in that there post that I was asking for citations was for Jimmy Fallon's first show, like would it have been that hard to link me to it rather than just call me dumb and be a complete and utter dick? What gives you he actual right to just slay your abuse on any individual who is simply asking for a citation on that there video? And you suggest that I am just "bitching on Reddit", but I feel in that there writing I have written above I have outlined the problems that I am having with you and that I am just not bitching or complaining but simply suggesting that any individual who posts un-cited information on this here website should be prepared to offer citations quickly rather than just try and add confusion and bullshit into the equation.

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

<TEXT> PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE MESSAGE BEFORE MESSAGING THE MODTEAM.
Because your account is new (under 10 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.
This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/cats requires all accounts to be at least **10 days old** AND have **at least 25 comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have less than 25 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.
Questions? [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcats) and let us know.

For example: What did you like or dislike about the book?

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

Based off the title of your post, it appears you're looking for a forgotten series. When you find the series you are looking for, it would be  appreciated if you added the title of the series as a [Flair](http://i.imgur.com/x307DTk.png) by the title of the post that way others will know that the answer has been found. This also allows others that have become interested based off your description to try the series for themselves. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

If this comment has appeared for a post not asking for identification of a series, please report this post and Aruseus493 will be around shortly to adjust my filter. 

Moelord3k was brought to you today by the keyword/phrase "remember the name" in /u/bill_the_nihilist's title.

<TEXT> Thanks for posting to /r/DIY!

Your post has been removed because it links to an unapproved domain. While links to other domains are permitted here, they do require moderator review.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

You have a couple of options:

1. If you are submitting a completed project that meets the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines), and you made the project yourself, you may message the moderators to request that your post be manually reviewed.

2. If you are asking for help with a specific aspect of a DIY project, and are linking to a website to explain your problem, please use the [Submit a Help Request](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/submit?selftext=true) link instead. Include the link to the website in the text of the post, and also include additional context and details so that others may help you more easily.

3. If you're asking a question that doesn't meet the "specific question about an *aspect* of a DIY project" requirement, such as "how can I fix the problem shown in this website" or "how can I make the project shown in this website", such posts generally do not meet the help request requirements in our [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines). Consider asking your question in the [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY, rather than creating a new post.

Remember that all posts are required to meet the posting guidelines. We encourage you to read the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines) for more information.

If you believe your link meets the posting requirements, please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDIY message=Please%20review%20my%20non-Imgur%20submission%20at%20https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/6abvgr/diy_gifts_mothers_day_gift_idea/).

If you're trying to post a product/promotion, or trying to drive traffic to your website, please see [reddit's spam rules here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F), and if you fall into that category, please go somewhere else.

<TEXT> Hey there! Your post has been removed because you did not include a correct tag at the **beginning** of your title. Without this, I'm not able to assign the appropriate flair. Please re-submit your post with one of the following tags in the title.

Your post will also be removed if the title is in all caps or if there are less than 2 words in the title (not including the tag). Please be sure to use a descriptive title.

If you're unsure of what tag to use, then [Question] or [Discussion] would probably work for most borderline cases. Thanks!

Tag | Usage
:--|:--
[Release] | New tweaks that have just been released or submitted
[Update] | Existing tweaks that have just been updated
[Beta] | Tweaks currently in beta
[Upcoming] | Tweaks currently in development
[News] | Tweak and jailbreak related news
[Discussion] | Jailbreak related discussions where anyone can give their opinion. For example, favorite/recommended tweaks, tweak concepts, tweak configurations, etc.
[Question] or [Help]| Troubleshooting jailbreak or tweak related issues and questions
[Request] | Requests for a tweak to be made or updated
[Tutorial] | How-to posts
[Meta] | Posts about /r/jailbreak itself
[Giveaway] | Theme or tweak giveaways
[Tip] | Shorter how-to posts

**NOTE: ** If you wish to use multiple tags, please do not "split" your tags like this: `[Question/Discussion]`. They should be separate like this: `[Question] [Discussion]`.

For more information, please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/38uktc/meta_link_flair_system/)

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abvf6/best_domain_name_to_start_make_money_online_blog/).

<TITLE> Daily Trade Advice Thread - Posted May 10, 2017 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 12:07:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This thread is intended for users to post any questions they may have about potential, pending, or completed trades for advice or feedback. 

For the best replies/advice/feedback, be clear on what you're trying to trade and what you're looking for in return.

Posting something like "What is 'Card A' worth?" won't elicit great responses. Everybody places different values on different cards.

Instead, post something like "I have 'Card A', would asking for 'Card B' 1:1 be fair?" or "Someone is offering 'Card A'   'Card B' for 'Card C'. Which side of the trade would you rather be on?"

These type of specific scenarios are more likely to be responded to as it is much easier to give input on them that "What can I get for 'Card A'?"

Please try to post again **using one of the tags from [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3f0jmg/meta_list_of_valid_title_tags_and_their/)**. A correct title would look something like this: "[Tag] This is the title of my post". Make sure to use square brackets.

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

<TEXT> **The site you have linked to is not on our approved sites list.** We have to remove it.

Preferred sites are: [soundcloud](//soundcloud.com), [bandcamp](//bandcamp.com), [youtube](//youtube.com], [vimeo](vimeo.com), and [spotify](//spotify.com).  These work best with reddit's embedding feature.  It is *highly unlikely* that you'll be unable to find the content you're trying to submit on these sites.  Spotify should only be used as a last resort, as many users do not have access. *Please* use conventional URLs, *not mobile links.*

If this stream is an exclusive release only appearing on one specific website, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/listentothis subject=One-time site approval!) and we will review your subimssion.  Please ensure that you have searched for the artist on each of our preferred sites before contacting us.

If this stream is a bandcamp or soundcloud link that is being embedded in the artist's home page, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/listentothis subject=Bandcamp or Soundcloud on Artist's Website!) to request manual approval.

The reasons for these community guidelines are explained in the [subreddit introduction.](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Get your dunce hats out, Fittit, it's time for your triweekly Stupid Questions Thread.

Post your question - stupid or otherwise - here to get an answer. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer. Many questions get submitted late each week that don't get a lot of action, so if your question didn't get answered before, feel free to post it again.

**As always, be sure to read the FAQ first.**

Also, there's a handy-dandy search bar to your right, and if you didn't know, you can also use Google to search fittit by using the limiter "site:reddit.com/r/fitness".

Be sure to check back often as questions get posted throughout the day. Lastly, it may be a good idea to sort comments by "new" to be sure the newer questions get some love as well.

So, what's rattling around in your brain this week, Fittit?

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.

<TEXT> We changed our name to r/POTUSWatch a week ago, that was because we decided we're going to track President Donald Trump's successors too and because other subs have refused to help us due to our name containing the word "Trump" so we didn't really have much choice. We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)

<TEXT> Hey there, welcome to /r/NewTubers!  We've detected that your account is less than a month old, so we've prepared this nifty little auto-message for you. 
Please read through the [NewTubers Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/52atut/newtubers_rules_v21/) so that you can understand what this community is about and the rules it abides by.  We'd also recommend you start by *not* promoting your content.  We are a *discussion-first* community, meaning that unsolicited advertising is forbidden.  As such, it may be easiest for you to observe for a bit how the community operates before diving in and asking for feedback on your channel.  If you're ever unsure of how things work, you can always ask the Mod team!  We'd rather you ask *beforehand* than get your posts removed for violating a rule.

This seems to have occurred because your title has a personal connection to the image. [Personalization of images is no longer permitted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/2xcj5q/my_blind_husband_juggling_our_rescue_dog_cat_and/)

Please review [the sidebar of the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/about/sidebar) [and wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/wiki/submissionrules#wiki_titles) and resubmit with a corrected title that only *describes* the subject of the photo with no personal connection. 

This is a new rule please [**contact the moderators**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/photoshopbattles subject=Personalization) if this isn't working properly.

<TEXT> Hello /u/AhmedZa3ter,

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

<TEXT> IMPORTANT: Here is an explanation of [what sort of content belongs on /r/WoahDude](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_.22woahdude_material.22.3F). If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Please note that it does not matter whether a post has 1 karma or 1000 karma. (I'm sure a leaked photo of Natalie Portman nude would get lots of upvotes too, but we will protect the integrity of our subreddit and remove it anyway, sadly. It's not all about the upvotes.)

TL;DR - We are NOT interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other "general" subreddits meant for sharing interesting or amazing content.

Instead, we're specifically made for **trippy or mesmerising** stuff that makes you go "woah dude!" in the way a stoned person says *woah dude* when confronted with something that tickles their mind or senses. In other words, we have a bit of a psychedelic slant. We're not about posting things that are merely neat or amazing, but instead, things that sort of mess with your mind, warp your reality. Things that might make a sober person feel like they're on drugs, or really disorient people who are already on them. 

Mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerising. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness. 

Think of the bizarre, erratic and psychedelic nature of Adult Swim. Or the wondrous, mind-expanding, awe-inspiring nature of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Or even the reality distorting, confusing, mind-fucking nature of Eternal Darkness for Gamecube. We're all of that.

Examples of material that is considered trippy or mesmerizing include but are not limited to:

* **Intense use of color and patterns:** [Intricate designs](http://i.imgur.com/UnbMnGl.jpg), [intense colors](https://i.giphy.com/26AHL9ByMyHJzgjkc.gif), [complex geometry](http://imgur.com/a/BAJ8j), [hyperrealism](http://imgur.com/a/xVX48), [fractals](http://i.giphy.com/xT0BKzyF3d7ljlJpug.gif), [recursion](http://i.imgur.com/HiwhxED.gifv), [psychedelia](http://www.oddityart.com/), [abstract art](http://i.imgur.com/ARL6oWs.gifv)
* **Extreme perspective:** [Macrophotography](http://imgur.com/a/vvvmC), [electron micrographs](http://imgur.com/tk9HiBi), [astrophotography](http://i.imgur.com/CWDYFwa.jpg)    
* **Giving a new understanding:** [Mathematical visualizations](http://imgur.com/gallery/moDHTKh), [scientific visualizations](http://imgur.com/FTeAKrr), [engineering visualizations](http://imgur.com/gallery/oC8j4Kn), [data visualizations](http://i.imgur.com/cpHrPyQ.jpg), [physics explanations](http://i.imgur.com/INKrGUS.gifv), exploded diagrams, [cross-sections](http://i.imgur.com/4n7hroi.jpg), [scientific art](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/2bv5b6/watercolors_added_to_ferrofluid_and_then_placed/), [reconsidering assumptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/12y8j4/the_rock_is_in_a_pool_pic/), [reframing perspective](https://i.imgur.com/gz4R6ty.gifv)
* **Altered reality:** [Slow motion footage](http://i.imgur.com/lFatiV7.gifv), [stop motion footage](http://i.imgur.com/00At51C.gifv), [bullet time](http://i.imgur.com/LqzejN9.gifv), [compositing](http://i.imgur.com/MtNUELc.gifv), [long exposure](http://i.imgur.com/9EAxa00.jpg), [special effects](http://i.imgur.com/P8DMiGR.gifv), [drug trip simulation](https://gfycat.com/PastBossyAxolotl)
* **Mesmerizing:** [Cinemagraphs](http://imgur.com/gallery/9cR4L), [chill music](http://open.spotify.com/user/123156102/playlist/0EedULhw6qjt7m6PD0Zsjb), [tranquil art](http://imgur.com/a/JN5Z7), [repetitive mechanical motion](http://i.imgur.com/jBG8fcN.gif), [interactive art](http://weavesilk.com/)
* **Sensory confusion:** [Optical illusions](http://imgur.com/a/VIeMk), [distortion](http://i.imgur.com/jHaAm.gif), [aural illusions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IXm6SuUigI), [stereograms](http://imgur.com/a/iGNlP), etc.
* **Cognitive confusion:** [Surrealism](http://imgur.com/gallery/8s9f5), [absurdism](http://i.imgur.com/G7p2clq.gif), [fifth-world art](http://i.imgur.com/HmtdV.jpg, [mystical art](http://i.imgur.com/LUzuxmr.jpg), [hypnagogia](http://imgur.com/a/kYONn), [strangeness](http://i.imgur.com/4MihoxD.gifv), [the fantastic](https://gfycat.com/LeafyPowerlessCorydorascatfish), [disjointedness](http://i.imgur.com/8PTGLci.gifv), [random and erratic behavior](http://i.imgur.com/dacZgCw.gifv), [datamoshing](https://i.imgur.com/zcuAETF.gifv), [pareidolia](http://imgur.com/OhwaPuD), [paradoxes](http://i.imgur.com/u6rR3BA.gifv), [strange philosophy](http://imgur.com/a/fRuFd?gallery), [strange science](http://imgur.com/gallery/crbiq), [cuil theory](http://shiranuiamaterasu.tumblr.com/post/33080297938)

Material that is NOT considered woahdude material:

* **~~Rarity~~:** ~~Rare talents, dangerous stunts, extreme human abilities, 1-in-a-million shots, sports highlights, etc.~~ **This type of trippiness is not allowed in WoahDude. It would totally flood our subreddit with stuff that's better suited for larger general subreddits like /r/videos, /r/gifs, etc. where these things are already very common.**

If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Please note that it does not matter whether a post has 1 karma or 1000 karma. (I'm sure a leaked photo of Natalie Portman nude would get lots of upvotes too, but we will protect the integrity of our subreddit and remove it anyway, sadly. It's not all about the upvotes.)

TL;DR - We are NOT interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other "general" subreddits meant for sharing interesting or amazing content.

Instead, we're specifically made for **trippy or mesmerising** stuff that makes you go "woah dude!" in the way a stoned person says *woah dude* when confronted with something that tickles their mind or senses. In other words, we have a bit of a psychedelic slant. We're not about posting things that are merely neat or amazing, but instead, things that sort of mess with your mind, warp your reality. Things that might make a sober person feel like they're on drugs, or really disorient people who are already on them. 

Mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerising. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness. 

Think of the bizarre, erratic and psychedelic nature of Adult Swim. Or the wondrous, mind-expanding, awe-inspiring nature of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Or even the reality distorting, confusing, mind-fucking nature of Eternal Darkness for Gamecube. We're all of that.

Examples of material that is considered trippy or mesmerizing include but are not limited to:

* **Intense use of color and patterns:** [Intricate designs](http://i.imgur.com/UnbMnGl.jpg), [intense colors](https://i.giphy.com/26AHL9ByMyHJzgjkc.gif), [complex geometry](http://imgur.com/a/BAJ8j), [hyperrealism](http://imgur.com/a/xVX48), [fractals](http://i.giphy.com/xT0BKzyF3d7ljlJpug.gif), [recursion](http://i.imgur.com/HiwhxED.gifv), [psychedelia](http://www.oddityart.com/), [abstract art](http://i.imgur.com/ARL6oWs.gifv)
* **Extreme perspective:** [Macrophotography](http://imgur.com/a/vvvmC), [electron micrographs](http://imgur.com/tk9HiBi), [astrophotography](http://i.imgur.com/CWDYFwa.jpg)    
* **Giving a new understanding:** [Mathematical visualizations](http://imgur.com/gallery/moDHTKh), [scientific visualizations](http://imgur.com/FTeAKrr), [engineering visualizations](http://imgur.com/gallery/oC8j4Kn), [data visualizations](http://i.imgur.com/cpHrPyQ.jpg), [physics explanations](http://i.imgur.com/INKrGUS.gifv), exploded diagrams, [cross-sections](http://i.imgur.com/4n7hroi.jpg), [scientific art](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/2bv5b6/watercolors_added_to_ferrofluid_and_then_placed/), [reconsidering assumptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/12y8j4/the_rock_is_in_a_pool_pic/), [reframing perspective](https://i.imgur.com/gz4R6ty.gifv)
* **Altered reality:** [Slow motion footage](http://i.imgur.com/lFatiV7.gifv), [stop motion footage](http://i.imgur.com/00At51C.gifv), [bullet time](http://i.imgur.com/LqzejN9.gifv), [compositing](http://i.imgur.com/MtNUELc.gifv), [long exposure](http://i.imgur.com/9EAxa00.jpg), [special effects](http://i.imgur.com/P8DMiGR.gifv), [drug trip simulation](https://gfycat.com/PastBossyAxolotl)
* **Mesmerizing:** [Cinemagraphs](http://imgur.com/gallery/9cR4L), [chill music](http://open.spotify.com/user/123156102/playlist/0EedULhw6qjt7m6PD0Zsjb), [tranquil art](http://imgur.com/a/JN5Z7), [repetitive mechanical motion](http://i.imgur.com/jBG8fcN.gif), [interactive art](http://weavesilk.com/)
* **Sensory confusion:** [Optical illusions](http://imgur.com/a/VIeMk), [distortion](http://i.imgur.com/jHaAm.gif), [aural illusions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IXm6SuUigI), [stereograms](http://imgur.com/a/iGNlP), etc.
* **Cognitive confusion:** [Surrealism](http://imgur.com/gallery/8s9f5), [absurdism](http://i.imgur.com/G7p2clq.gif), [fifth-world art](http://i.imgur.com/HmtdV.jpg, [mystical art](http://i.imgur.com/LUzuxmr.jpg), [hypnagogia](http://imgur.com/a/kYONn), [strangeness](http://i.imgur.com/4MihoxD.gifv), [the fantastic](https://gfycat.com/LeafyPowerlessCorydorascatfish), [disjointedness](http://i.imgur.com/8PTGLci.gifv), [random and erratic behavior](http://i.imgur.com/dacZgCw.gifv), [datamoshing](https://i.imgur.com/zcuAETF.gifv), [pareidolia](http://imgur.com/OhwaPuD), [paradoxes](http://i.imgur.com/u6rR3BA.gifv), [strange philosophy](http://imgur.com/a/fRuFd?gallery), [strange science](http://imgur.com/gallery/crbiq), [cuil theory](http://shiranuiamaterasu.tumblr.com/post/33080297938)

Material that is NOT considered woahdude material:

* **~~Rarity~~:** ~~Rare talents, dangerous stunts, extreme human abilities, 1-in-a-million shots, sports highlights, etc.~~ **This type of trippiness is not allowed in WoahDude. It would totally flood our subreddit with stuff that's better suited for larger general subreddits like /r/videos, /r/gifs, etc. where these things are already very common.**

<TEXT> Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abtkq/worst_or_useless_superpowers_you_can_think_of/).

<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

<TEXT> Hello /u/mishranamitmishra! It looks like you're trying to post a direct image, or something that might not be the original source, to /r/dataisbeautiful. **I've removed the current thread,** since you're probably trying to do one of three things. Let me help you with posting...

---

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [complete original source article](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization *where it was originally introduced* by the author (not an image on the site, but **the actual full web page article**). [More information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Need+help+finding+the+original+source message=I+need+help+finding+the+original+source+of+this+image:).
        
---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Resubmit your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. subject1093 will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_plagiarism.3F) in this subreddit. No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.
        
---

##If the original source is a PDF:

*Leave your post as-is* and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Exception+for+PDF message=I+need+an+exception+for+this+post:%0A%0AOriginal+PDF:). We'll make an exception for you. In your modmail message, be sure to include the original PDF.

Your post will be manually approved by the mod team, and we'll sticky the original PDF to the top of the comment thread so our readers can get context.

<TEXT> It seems you are possibly discussing stealing or stealing-related topics. Although this is against every countries' rules (and even a pesky commandment or two to those non-atheist filth), it's important to remember to be responsible. Content creators can only create said content because they receive funding from things you shit on.

Stealing is an important freedom in our fascist dictatorships, and it's important to remember these things before you pass rightful judgement on thieves discussing it:

 Some steal games because they believe the creator doesn't deserve financial compensation for the state of the product that was released. Those people are dicks.

 Some steal something that they already bought simply to remove the DRM. Which is just another word for stealing.

 Some steal to emulate NES games they definitely had 25 years ago. I signed that waiver Bill Clinton.

 Some steal to try products before they make a financial commitment to them. Just like WinZIP.

 Some steal simply because they cannot afford it. They are like Aladdin. But instead of stealing life sustaining nourishment, it's No Man's Sky.

 Some steal to get something that's no longer available. Nobody actually does, but we'll leave this here because it's the one of two somewhat legitimate reasons.

 Some steal because their country censors or doesn't import it. Despite the irony that pirating was stealing things from other countries, this is a somewhat valid reason to do so. Please move to a new fascist dictatorship.

 Some steal games because of timed exclusivity. If they don't have access to it yet, they use piracy as a method to access it before it's available to them. Just like when Greg who works at Gamestop slips me a copy on Monday. I'll totally pay him, er, uh Gamestop later.

Lastly, here's a few tips: AdBlock is awesome for hiding fake download links. Fake download links are usually a sign of a reputable website, please don't help fund them. Deluge is an excellent open-source client that isn't in close cooperation with the MPAA (unlike uTorrent, uninstall it as soon as possible, OH MY GOD, I'M GONNA CUM). Oh, and remember: torrenting in itself isn't illegal, and it's probably not stealing! It's simply a method of transferring copyrighted files. It's what copyrighted data you transfer that matters.

If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Please note that it does not matter whether a post has 1 karma or 1000 karma. (I'm sure a leaked photo of Natalie Portman nude would get lots of upvotes too, but we will protect the integrity of our subreddit and remove it anyway, sadly. It's not all about the upvotes.)

TL;DR - We are NOT interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other "general" subreddits meant for sharing interesting or amazing content.

Instead, we're specifically made for **trippy or mesmerising** stuff that makes you go "woah dude!" in the way a stoned person says *woah dude* when confronted with something that tickles their mind or senses. In other words, we have a bit of a psychedelic slant. We're not about posting things that are merely neat or amazing, but instead, things that sort of mess with your mind, warp your reality. Things that might make a sober person feel like they're on drugs, or really disorient people who are already on them. 

Mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerising. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness. 

Think of the bizarre, erratic and psychedelic nature of Adult Swim. Or the wondrous, mind-expanding, awe-inspiring nature of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Or even the reality distorting, confusing, mind-fucking nature of Eternal Darkness for Gamecube. We're all of that.

Examples of material that is considered trippy or mesmerizing include but are not limited to:

* **Intense use of color and patterns:** [Intricate designs](http://i.imgur.com/UnbMnGl.jpg), [intense colors](https://i.giphy.com/26AHL9ByMyHJzgjkc.gif), [complex geometry](http://imgur.com/a/BAJ8j), [hyperrealism](http://imgur.com/a/xVX48), [fractals](http://i.giphy.com/xT0BKzyF3d7ljlJpug.gif), [recursion](http://i.imgur.com/HiwhxED.gifv), [psychedelia](http://www.oddityart.com/), [abstract art](http://i.imgur.com/ARL6oWs.gifv)
* **Extreme perspective:** [Macrophotography](http://imgur.com/a/vvvmC), [electron micrographs](http://imgur.com/tk9HiBi), [astrophotography](http://i.imgur.com/CWDYFwa.jpg)    
* **Giving a new understanding:** [Mathematical visualizations](http://imgur.com/gallery/moDHTKh), [scientific visualizations](http://imgur.com/FTeAKrr), [engineering visualizations](http://imgur.com/gallery/oC8j4Kn), [data visualizations](http://i.imgur.com/cpHrPyQ.jpg), [physics explanations](http://i.imgur.com/INKrGUS.gifv), exploded diagrams, [cross-sections](http://i.imgur.com/4n7hroi.jpg), [scientific art](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/2bv5b6/watercolors_added_to_ferrofluid_and_then_placed/), [reconsidering assumptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/12y8j4/the_rock_is_in_a_pool_pic/), [reframing perspective](https://i.imgur.com/gz4R6ty.gifv)
* **Altered reality:** [Slow motion footage](http://i.imgur.com/lFatiV7.gifv), [stop motion footage](http://i.imgur.com/00At51C.gifv), [bullet time](http://i.imgur.com/LqzejN9.gifv), [compositing](http://i.imgur.com/MtNUELc.gifv), [long exposure](http://i.imgur.com/9EAxa00.jpg), [special effects](http://i.imgur.com/P8DMiGR.gifv), [drug trip simulation](https://gfycat.com/PastBossyAxolotl)
* **Mesmerizing:** [Cinemagraphs](http://imgur.com/gallery/9cR4L), [chill music](http://open.spotify.com/user/123156102/playlist/0EedULhw6qjt7m6PD0Zsjb), [tranquil art](http://imgur.com/a/JN5Z7), [repetitive mechanical motion](http://i.imgur.com/jBG8fcN.gif), [interactive art](http://weavesilk.com/)
* **Sensory confusion:** [Optical illusions](http://imgur.com/a/VIeMk), [distortion](http://i.imgur.com/jHaAm.gif), [aural illusions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IXm6SuUigI), [stereograms](http://imgur.com/a/iGNlP), etc.
* **Cognitive confusion:** [Surrealism](http://imgur.com/gallery/8s9f5), [absurdism](http://i.imgur.com/G7p2clq.gif), [fifth-world art](http://i.imgur.com/HmtdV.jpg, [mystical art](http://i.imgur.com/LUzuxmr.jpg), [hypnagogia](http://imgur.com/a/kYONn), [strangeness](http://i.imgur.com/4MihoxD.gifv), [the fantastic](https://gfycat.com/LeafyPowerlessCorydorascatfish), [disjointedness](http://i.imgur.com/8PTGLci.gifv), [random and erratic behavior](http://i.imgur.com/dacZgCw.gifv), [datamoshing](https://i.imgur.com/zcuAETF.gifv), [pareidolia](http://imgur.com/OhwaPuD), [paradoxes](http://i.imgur.com/u6rR3BA.gifv), [strange philosophy](http://imgur.com/a/fRuFd?gallery), [strange science](http://imgur.com/gallery/crbiq), [cuil theory](http://shiranuiamaterasu.tumblr.com/post/33080297938)

Material that is NOT considered woahdude material:

* **~~Rarity~~:** ~~Rare talents, dangerous stunts, extreme human abilities, 1-in-a-million shots, sports highlights, etc.~~ **This type of trippiness is not allowed in WoahDude. It would totally flood our subreddit with stuff that's better suited for larger general subreddits like /r/videos, /r/gifs, etc. where these things are already very common.**

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6absym/natural_disaster_survival_stories/).

<TEXT> Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

<TEXT> Hey /u/Hongsmile! Thank you for your submission!    

Unfortunately it has been removed because your submission must be a direct link to an image or an album of images. Please feel free to re-submit using a direct image link (must end in jpg, gif, png, etc). Blogs, social media, and similar types of websites **will not be approved**, as per Rule 4.

Also, if your link ends in ?1 please remove that and anything else extraneous before submitting. 

---

#####Also, we just started working on a whitelist for legitimate, reputable news sites related to the arts world. If your post links to such a website, please send us a modmail so that we can add it to the whitelist. Again, no blogs.

---

Thanks for understanding! 3

<TEXT> Hello, Your post appears to be too vague and breaks Rule 6 (and possibly others) of /r/mildlyinteresting and has been removed. Your title must be a concise description of the content. No jokes, backstories or other fluff. "This was inside my car" or "The way this door opens" are unacceptable. It should act as a "spoiler" for the image. If it leaves the viewer surprised in some way after viewing, it will be removed. [Read about rule 6 in more detail here or in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/21p15y/rule_6_for_dummies/). Still unsure? Feel free to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmildlyinteresting) with a link to this post for a detailed explanation.

<TEXT> Hey there! Your post has been removed because you did not include a correct tag at the **beginning** of your title. Without this, I'm not able to assign the appropriate flair. Please re-submit your post with one of the following tags in the title.

Your post will also be removed if the title is in all caps or if there are less than 2 words in the title (not including the tag). Please be sure to use a descriptive title.

If you're unsure of what tag to use, then [Question] or [Discussion] would probably work for most borderline cases. Thanks!

:--|:--
[Release] | New tweaks that have just been released or submitted
[Update] | Existing tweaks that have just been updated
[Beta] | Tweaks currently in beta
[Upcoming] | Tweaks currently in development
[News] | Tweak and jailbreak related news
[Discussion] | Jailbreak related discussions where anyone can give their opinion. For example, favorite/recommended tweaks, tweak concepts, tweak configurations, etc.
[Question] or [Help]| Troubleshooting jailbreak or tweak related issues and questions
[Request] | Requests for a tweak to be made or updated
[Tutorial] | How-to posts
[Meta] | Posts about /r/jailbreak itself
[Giveaway] | Theme or tweak giveaways
[Tip] | Shorter how-to posts

**NOTE: ** If you wish to use multiple tags, please do not "split" your tags like this: `[Question/Discussion]`. They should be separate like this: `[Question] [Discussion]`.

Everything in bold is required, the rest is optional.  Check your post now: Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre] using square brackets []?

Please include the [year] and director information if available, and put any additional comments at the end of your submission title.

Here are some examples of correct titles:

 The Buggles - Video Killed the Radio Star [New.Wave Synthpop] [1979] directed by Russell Mulcahy - First video ever shown on MTV!

 A$AP Rocky - PMW (All I Really Need) (feat. Schoolboy Q) [Rap Hip-Hop] [2013]

Unfortunately it has been removed because per Rule 6, your submission must be a link to a meme image. Please feel free to re-submit using a direct image link (must end in jpg, gif, png, etc). Websites will not be approved as posts, unfortunately.

Also, if your link ends in ?1 please remove that and anything else extraneous before submitting. 

Thanks for understanding! Stay wholesome. 3

<TEXT> Hello /u/AndrewKelley49! Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from spam, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions until you've built up some comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our sidebar rules:
   
/r/dankmemes/about/rules
  
r/dankmemes/about/sidebar

We ask you to participate in the comment sections of our subreddit to build up the karma you need to post here and to learn the rules and standards of our community, then you won't be affected by this spam filter. Spend some time getting to know /r/dankmemes and then you'll be welcome to make submissions. 

Thanks for understanding!

#####NOTE: Do not message us asking how many points you need. We will not tell you. In fact we may mute you. You do not need many points. Just get out there and make some comments and you'll be all good in no time.

<TEXT> Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Your post will also be removed if the title is in all caps or if there are less than 2 words in the title (not including the tag). Please be sure to use a descriptive title.

If you're unsure of what tag to use, then [Question] or [Discussion] would probably work for most borderline cases. Thanks!

<TEXT> We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses "()" or braces "{}" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only "[W]" but not also "[H]" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Please also take this time to [examine our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/rules) for future reference.

If you intend to contact us about this action (or any other ones), please ensure that you have read this comment in its entirety (making sure to read through any relevant links) and make sure you grasp a full understanding of what it means *before* contacting us.

<TITLE> Reactive Dogs Daily Updates [May 10, 2017] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 11:29:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Welcome to Daily Updates! Feel free to share about your progress or setbacks, chit chat, or just let us know how you're doing today! 

Remember to be kind and respectful. We all know the struggles of working with a reactive dog firsthand; remember to show the same patience toward your fellow owners as you do your reactive dogs. 

Not sure what to chat about? We have some themed days you can use for inspiration: 

* Medication Monday - Is your dog on any supplements or medication to help with their reactivity? What has been your experience? What questions do you have for people currently using medications? Please work with a veterinarian or veterinary behaviorist if you would like to start your dogs on medication.

* Tuesday Tricks - Sometimes it's nice to be working on some tricks 'just for fun' to mix it up and take a break from all the hard reactivity training. What fun, silly tricks have you been working on with your dog? Show us your videos of any completed or in progress tricks!

* Wednesday Walks - What methods do you use to keep your dog's attention on walks? What kind of areas do you walk in? How did your latest walk go? Feel free to share pictures or videos of your walks or favorite places to go!

* Tracker Thursday - Creating a training or reactivity tracker is a helpful way to monitor your progress and can help keep things in perspective. Are you using a tracker? Have you seen any templates that look promising or do you have new ideas you want to try out? Feel free to share your own or ask questions!

* Friday Fun - Working with a reactive dog can be tough, so we like to remember the positive things. What fun moments did you have with your dog this week?

* Self Care Sunday - Taking care of yourself is an important part of the whole process! What have you done to relax this week? How do you like to unwind from a bad reactivity day? Any tips for putting things in perspective and turning your mood around?

Showcase Wednesday (we're not very good with names) is the place to share your community content with the /r/Paragon community. Are you a streamer and would like to get the word out for your stream? A youtuber or content creator that would like to share what you've been up to recently? Here's your chance. Everything in this post will be exempt from the usual self-promotional rule of the subreddit, this will not affect your ratio.

We do ask however that you limit top level posts to 1 per user, and do not simply link your stream or channel - write a little bit about yourself and why the community should check your content out!

This thread happens every **Wednesday**.

**Earhart**: Oh great! I boost the same tile you change to and I have a good leader skill~    
**Grassvalley**: Oh no, Earhart! Your leader skill doesnt boost Pascas type though. I can help out by leading if you two provide support!    
**Pasca**: Great! Ill be nice to have a active healer if we need it too!    
**Earhart**: Now lets get out there and make the rest of our team! Wait...who else should we use?    
**Grassvalley**: Hmm...Im not sure. Maybe we should ask for some help here?    

Remember to include as much as you can:

* Your goal. Different content requires different teams.
* Your team needs to adjust accordingly. No one team will fit best to all content.
* Your strongest damage dealer.
* This changes depending on the enemy. Elements and weapons like God Eater weapons come into play.
* Mystic Artes (if any)
* Please list your Arte Souls and their respective units that you own. Please indicate their elements and levels as well.
* Your heroes/units. A screenshot is best, but if not possible, please include at least a list of your best.
* When listing units, please include elements as well.
* Gear and guardians
* These are as much of a team as your heroes. Make sure to not leave out anything relevant.     </TEXT>

If youre looking for a Japanese account, or looking to gift/trade a Japanese account, please add "**Japan**" or "**JP**" in bold to your account post. **Please be mindful of scammers. Scammers will be banned. 
Keep these tips in mind when dealing with anybody**:  

* Check their post history. If they have a small history, or no history, don't deal with them.
* If their only /r/TalesofLink history involves the gifting thread, don't deal with them.
* If most of their posts are in the /u/FireEmblemHeroes subreddit, and they try to offer a Fire Emblem account, don't deal with them.
* If you find their current account screenshot matches the screenshot given on a previous thread, don't deal with them.
* If you notice them asking for accounts on multiple occasions, or claiming to have lost their account on multiple occasions, don't deal with them.  

**Use this thread at your own risk.** Please report any suspicious activity to the /r/TalesofLink mod mail.

<TEXT> We changed our name to r/POTUSWatch a week ago, that was because we decided we're going to track President Donald Trump's successors too and because other subs have refused to help us due to our name containing the word "Trump" so we didn't really have much choice. We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :)

<DATE> 2017-05-10 10:16:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone! In less than a day we've hit 1000 subscribers! That's amazing, I'm really glad to see this sub taking off. We're gonna try and run the daily thread a little differently this time, since the majority opinion was that questions and pictures should be separated. So here we go.
Pictures Thread![1]
Questions Thread![2]
This thread, at least for the early days of the sub, will be used for discussing things you guys want to see happen here! Rule changes, mod issues, what type of content should and shouldn't be allowed. Anything related to the running of the sub basically.
What I have planned for the near future
-  Wiki pages with info for beginners, including recommended starter kits and trustworthy vendors, as well as pages with info for more advanced users interested in rebuildables, mods, regulated devices, battery safety etc. - A banner design contest with prizes! - Contests - Possible sidebar overhaul. - Whatever else you guys want to see.
Some questions for you guys
How do you want to handle flair? Should everyone be able to pick their own, reserve flair for mods, or for users who hit a certain level of karma in the sub? It's up to you! Let us know your thoughts and as always feel free to post suggestions for anything else you want to see happen!
Also, how would you guys want to see giveaways in this sub? This was/is a very talked about issue back in the old country, and there are so many options with their pros and cons; we want to know what the community wants.
Thanks again for all the support here, I love seeing pages filled with upvotes and discussion instead of downvotes and hate.  If you guys like something, please upvote.  We've been seeing a lot of downvotes on content from people probably just coming in to downvote.
Also a reminder, make sure you mark things as spam when appropriate and message the mods to report trolls and rule breakers so that we can take action! It's hard to do anything if we don't see its happening. The sub is growing fast and it's likely stuff will slip through the cracks unless the community works with us to stay on top of it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Q A] Daily Questions and New User Introduction </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 10:08:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is the place to post your writing questions that fall short of starting discussion. Additionally, the daily Q A serves as a visible hub for new users to find what they're looking for.

[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/faq) -- Questions asked frequently

[Wiki Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/index) -- Ever-evolving and woefully under-curated

[User Flair Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/flairguide) -- Feel free to mark thyself


[Open Calls for Submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/5gjxc3/open_calls_for_submission_122016)


**General Posting Guidelines** 

1. All submissions must be directly related to writing and contain enough information to start a discussion *on reddit*. Low-quality posts, especially those with only a link or title, obvious spam or site promotion, self-acknowledgement, and solicitations to do your work for you are more likely to get removed without warning. Off-topic and promotion may be posted in the Weekly Check-in sticky.

2. **Post all requests for feedback or critique partners in the Weekly Critique sticky.** If youre looking for help with homework, check out /r/homeworkhelp.

3. **Sharing for the sake of sharing is not allowed outside the Weekly Check-in sticky.** This includes your own writing (when not seeking feedback and especially when seeking views or sales), personal blogs, publication acceptance or rejection, stories you really like, or humorous images.

4. Calls for submissions (including posts inquiring about miscellaneous writing work, for pay or not) **must** include payment information, deadlines, rights requested, and any other relevant information.

5. Please report any rule-breaking posts, as well as abusive comments or harassment. Civility will be enforced, but spirited discourse can often blur the line between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Keep general reddiquette in mind.

6. Moderators may, at their discretion and without warning, remove posts and ban accounts which they consider harmful to the community.

**Getting the Most out of /r/writing**

--While linked-posts are allowed, a quality self-post would be a summary of the content or a block of quoted content, possibly your own thoughts, and a link to the off-site content. Linked-posts are best for reputable sources and big news items. Self-posts are best for more nuanced and specific aspects of writing-related content as well as discussion-starters.

--This is not a critique-focused subreddit. In addition to the genre-specific subreddits, /r/destructivereaders is a great alternative if you're looking for a workshop-like community.

--While we celebrate publishing discussion, please keep all self-promotion to the Weekly Check-in sticky. Feel free to use your subreddit flair as an advertising space!

--Help keep the subreddit clean and on-topic by using the report feature to bring attention to rule-breaking posts. If you have any questions about these guidelines, please contact the moderators. </TEXT>

Welcome to Worldwide Wednesday, where we talk about news and events from around the world. Rules for /r/Denmark are still in place, the only difference is that the content is about the world around us. 

Do keep in mind that submitting posts not related to Denmark is still not allowed and that it should be contained to this post. We also want to encourage common sense and source criticism and therefore         encourage people to share news from big or recognized/established media.

Welcome to the Weekly Store Thread. 
    
In an effort to stop the many personalized store questions and experiences, we are no longer allowing any more store related threads. 
However, we have created these weekly threads instead, to have everyone's store issues, experiences, and questions compiled into one place, to make things more organized. 

In these weekly threads, you can:

* Comment about your complaints, praises, and issues with the store

* Share your experiences and merchandise you have bought in the store

* Ask any questions regarding the store

<TEXT> Welcome to the Purchase Help Thread. This thread refreshes once every few days.

## Requesting purchase advice

This is the _only_ place in /r/audiophile where you can request purchase advice.  Since we don't want to arbitrarily discriminate, it doesn't matter if your budget is $50 or $50 000, or whether you're inquiring about vintage or new - your question goes here.

If you want to ask a gear purchase question, it's of help if you read [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/wiki/purchaseadvice) first.

After asking a question, please have some patience as responders may not always be immediately available.

## Headphone-related question?

Please use /r/headphones/about/sticky instead (we won't remove your post, but you're more likely to get a good answer in that thread).

## Recording-related question?

While we won't remove questions about microphones or recording gear either, you'll be much better off asking in the [/r/audioengineering sticky thread](/r/audioengineering/about/sticky), after you've studied their [getting started guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/wiki/gettingstarted).

## Proposed systems

In an effort to cut down on some of the repetitive questions, here are the absolutely cheapest systems we are willing to recommend.

* **$120**:   [Micca PB42X](http://www.amazon.com/Micca-PB42X-Powered-Bookshelf-Speakers/dp/B00NXAEPDC/)  _or_  [Micca MB42X](http://www.amazon.com/Micca-MB42X-Bookshelf-Speakers-Tweeter/dp/B00E7H8GG2) + [SMSL SA-60](http://www.amazon.com/SMSL-SA-60-60WPC-Digital-Amplifier/dp/B00PA3ECGK/) if you prefer separate components.
* **$280**:   [JBL LSR305](http://www.amazon.com/JBL-LSR305-Professional-Studio-Monitor/dp/B00F1DEI8G/)


## Answering questions?

It would be helpful if you sort the thread by new.

<TEXT> Hello and welcome to **AskAuraxis** the weekly thread for any of your Planetside related questions. 

* Feel free to ask any question about anything to do with Planetside and **don't be scared if you think it may be stupid**.  

* The main aim of this is that: **no question should go unanswered** so if you know the answer to someone's question, speak up! 

* Try and keep questions somewhat serious, **this is not really the place for sarcastic or rhetorical questions**. 

* **We are not DGC**, we can't answer questions that should be directed to them.

* Remember if you're asking about guns etc. to say your faction and if you're asking about outfits to specify the server as well.

* Sorting by new helps the questions less likely to be seen get answered. You can now do this temporarily using [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/).

* **Have fun!**

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The level exchange is an opportunity for users to share and play each others levels.   

What is proposed is that you take this post and sort it by "new" and try to play and leave comments on reddit for 2-4 levels that other people have posted. You don't have to star it if you don't want to, but there really is no reason to be stingy if you like the level.  Once you've done that, post your own level and a brief description of it. Preferably include what the theme of the level is, what style of Mario game you used, and about how difficult you think it is!

A new exchange thread is created every 48 hours.    

Use the exchange as an opportunity to get to know other makers and have fun.

<TITLE> [PSA] Daily PSA Thread for May 10, 2017 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 09:10:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **This thread is for all Public Service Announcements for today's date. Please post in this thread instead of posting separately with the [PSA] tag.**

*Note to users who are interested in opening their town to users from other regions for special events: we advise that you make a separate post and tag it [GIVEAWAY] rather than posting in this thread. You are likely to get a lot of interest, especially if you have a Japanese or Korean version of the game, and posting it in its own thread will be much less of a headache for everyone involved. Thank you for your generosity!*

A PSA is used to announce a service in your town that you would like to invite people to participate in, such as premiums at Re-Tail, Katrina's or Redd's tent in your plaza, and others along those lines; see [the rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/ACTrade/wiki/rules#wiki_permitted_posts_and_tagging_guidelines) for more examples. Please only post if you are available, and edit your original comment if your availability changes, including to "close" your thread, so to speak.

All posting guidelines still apply to the Daily PSA Thread. Posts in this thread **do not** count against the spamming rule. You may have an active PSA in this thread and a second active post outside this thread.

**NOTE TO HOSTS: WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED HOSTING/NO LONGER AVAILABLE,** ***DO NOT DELETE YOUR COMMENT.*** Simply edit it to say you have gone offline. Deleting the top comment makes it difficult to figure out what happened and so will invalidate any RMM reviews left for you.

**If you wish to review someone on /r/RateMyMayor for participating in this thread, please link to the host's original top comment for the event (click "permalink" under that comment to get the correct URL), to make the trade easier to find in the thread. Failure to do so may result in the review being removed if the trade cannot be found easily.**

**REMINDER:** If you are hosting a premium event, know that Bell Boom ordinance does not stack with Premium. Premium items will sell at the same price regardless of town ordinance.

 **HAPPY TRADING! GOOD LUCK!**

<TITLE> NC/NP Trade/Sell   Pet UFA/UFT Thread! (May 10, 2017) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> # Daily NC/NP Trade/Sell   Pet UFA/UFT Thread! (May 10, 2017)

Welcome to the Daily NC/NP Trade/Sell   Pet UFA/UFT thread. A new thread will be made every day at midnight NST. Please refrain from posting individual threads and use this thread for your trading purposes!

# Items

**Remember that you can use Ctrl + F to help you find items you might be interested in!**
**Please use the following specific formats to make it easier for people searching for either NC or NP items.**
## Format - NP

Please use this format when buying or selling items:

**Buying:**

item

**Selling:**

item - price (or link to your shop/trades/auctions)

## Format - NC

**Seeking:**

item(s) or link to wishlist

**Offering:**

item(s) or link to trade list

## Neocash Trading
Please keep in mind that you can ONLY trade Neocash items for other Neocash items and cannot buy them with neopoints.

To trade an NC item you need a gift box that you receive when redeeming NC cards, opening Gift Box Capsules or other events. To read more about trading Neocash items check out the [Jellyneo guide](http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=ncmall#trading).

*If you're trading NC items, here are a couple guides to help you out with values and avoid being scammed:* **ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR WHEN THESE WERE LAST UPDATED AS THEY MAY BE OUTDATED.**

* http://www.neopets.com/~lyl
* http://www.neopets.com/~loosi
* http://www.neopets.com/~korolie
* http://www.neopets.com/~saphronn

# Pets

This also is the place to post all your pets that you are seeking new homes for, whether you're trading or adopting out.

Please post the pet or pets you currently have up for adoption, that you are zapping to adopt out, or that you wish to trade.

You do not *have to* post the name of the pet or the name of your account if you do not wish, but remember to check your reddit PMs if this is the only means of communication you are allowing!

**Please update or edit your comments once you have found a new home for your pets.**

If you want a pet, or are trying to adopt a pet out _but want to give redditors first dibs_, the [/r/neopets Dream Pet List](https://r-neopets-dream-pets.herokuapp.com/) may be of some use! [](/clap)

# Rules

0. **DO NOT** mention /r/neopets or reddit on Neopets in any way.
0. Be excellent to each other, as always.

We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ##Daily Support Thread

Hello! Welcome to today's **Daily Support Thread**

This thread is to help answer all of your simple questions, and keep /r/AppleWatch's front page clean! Got a simple question? Get a simple answer. It's as simple as that. The thread's been set to sort posts randomly to push all sorts of questions to the top.

####Before you ask, please make sure you've checked out our wiki's [**troubleshooting guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/wiki/guide/troubleshooting), searched it on **Google**, or used our [**subreddit search**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/search?q= restrict_sr=on) feature *(wow, who knew that was a thing)*! If you can't find an answer, you want some further insight, or you're just lazy, feel free to post your question here. 

*****

###What can I ask?
If you've been asked to post your question here, then go ahead! Otherwise, if your question is one or two sentences long, and is pretty simple (such as asking for recommendations, apps, troubleshooting, app issues, etc), go ahead. If you need a lot more investigation, or you're asking for many opinions, go ahead and post it elsewhere (it may be removed if it's too simple, or it's deemed to be more suitable for here).

###See all the other threads
[For your viewing enjoyment!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/search?q=Daily+Support+Question+Megathread+subreddit%3AAppleWatch+author%3Asubject1093 restrict_sr=on sort=new t=all)

Smile aga--- oh, that's a part of the scrip-, I mean: no script! No script at all. I am treated so nicely; How was your day, by thE way... Loving life as Per usual!

* **(8)** non-stop action and/or lots of goals

* **(9)** game of the year contender

<TEXT> Welcome to the JudgeMyAccent thread. Each week on Wednesday at 06:00 UTC, I, your faithful Automoderator, will be hosting a thread where in users can record their voice and get opinions from native speakers. Also check out /r/JudgeMyAccent. 

Here's how it will work:

* Go to http://vocaroo.com/ or http://soundcloud.com/ or https://clyp.it/ and record your voice. (No other recording service will be allowed).

* 1 comment should contain only 1 language. Format should be as follows: LANGUAGE - LINK + TEXT (OPTIONAL). Eg. French - http://vocaroo.com/------- Text:  J'ai voyag  travers le monde pendant un an et je me suis senti perdu seulement quand je suis rentr chez moi.

* Native or Fluent speakers can give their opinion by replying to the comment and are allowed to criticize positively. (Tip: Use CTRL+F to find the languages)

Consider sorting by new.

<TITLE> Community Post | Guild Recruitment | 05/10/2017 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 08:03:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 
Well, it is Hump Day and that means its time for the Guild Registrar to open up his bulletin board for Guild Recruitment. The purpose of this post is to allow for guilds to recruit players and for players that are looking for a guild to see what different guilds have to offer.

Please observe the following rules when using this bulletin board to allow for all guilds to have an equal chance to be seen:

* "Looking for Guild" posts are **not** allowed here. If you cannot find a guild you like below, use /r/SWTORGuilds.
* Make sure to mention the **name** of your guild, what **server** you are on, and what **faction or factions** you are part of within the first sentence of your post.
* Only **one** post per guild per week.
* Please keep all posts to **less than 250 words.** If you wish to post a longer post, make one in /r/SWTORGuilds and link it here with a shorter summary.
* It is suggested that you make a similar post in /r/SWTORGuilds and post a link of it here with your recruitment post.
* Please keep this area clear of all posts responding to a Guild Recruitment. Instead, message the person who made the post or respond to their post on /r/SWTORGuilds if they have one.
* Please do not downvote guilds that do not interest you. Someone else may be looking for that type of gameplay.

If you have any questions or comments, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fswtor).

<TEXT> Use this thread if you have any questions about the game or need advice. Post here if you need help with tactics, don't know what team to pick, require technical support... you get the idea.

Also please remember that this thread will only work if you also answer questions as well as ask them. A good rule of thumb to follow is if you ask a question, then try and answer one or two questions as "payment". This keeps the thread moving quickly and ensures that everyone's questions get answered.

<TEXT> Share your Football Manager stories and videos here.

You took Potter's Bar all the way up to the Prem? Win the World Cup with Vanuatu? Did you raise that 2-star winger from a pup and now he's killing it     everywhere? Or maybe it was something less heroic (like winning La Liga with Real Madrid 2037) and you feel the need to share? Welcome to ~~Alcoholics Anonymous~~ /r/footballmanagergames' Story Saturday!

Tell us about the journey, the life, the ups, the downs.

We have also decided to allow people to post their videos in this thread as well. Originally the videos had their own daily thread, but due to subreddits only being able to use 2 stickies at any one times, all of our stickies were used up. This meant that if important updates were made to the subreddit, or awesome user-submitted content was made, we would not be able to sticky them without removing the sticky thread in slot 2. By combining the two threads in to one, we now have a free slot to do whatever we please and give us more flexibility with sticky posts.

<TEXT> We changed our name to r/POTUSWatch a week ago, that was because we decided we're going to track President Donald Trump's successors too and because other subs have refused to help us due to our name containing the word "Trump" so we didn't really have much choice. We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This thread is for simple style questions that don't warrant their own thread

(although we strongly suggest checking the sidebar and the wiki before posting!)

Fit checks and "Help me find a pair of Jeans that has X, Y, and Z" questions are a great use of this thread.

If you have questions about how your jeans fit, about a particular fabric, when is this jean coming out, where can I find jean X to try on in state Y, what jeans have this fit with these measurements, what jeans fade the fastext, what jeans fade the slowest.

No question is too simple for Simple Questions. Bashing people will not be tolerated. And "Read the Sidebar" is not a valid answer here!

Also we recommend sorting this thread by new comments.

Be Helpful!

Be Civil!

<TITLE> [Discussion] Winning Wednesdays (Week of May 10) - Ask /r/spikes Anything! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 07:02:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Taking a nod from the successful "Tutor Tuesdays" over at /r/magictcg, we spikes have decided to begin our own series of "Ask us anything" posts. Every Wednesday is your chance to ask that question that's been bugging you without fear of downvotes, ridicule, etc...as long as it involves something relating to a spike (Yes, you can even ask what a Spike is...although I assume you know that at this point!). 

The Moderators came to the conclusion that we needed a weekly thread to 1) benefit the group as a whole, and 2) reduce the number of similar posts we see on a daily basis that can be rectified with a weekly thread. Much like the deckbuilding posts of old, we'll put a sticky on the sidebar for easy access.
Here are a set of general courtesies when posting here, paraphrased from /u/bokchoykn in /r/magictcg):

Ask thought-provoking questions.
Tell us very specifically about what you want.
Be open to any suggestions.

Remember that, in the end, this isn't /r/magictcg. Please gear your questions towards a competitive, play-to-win audience. After all, that's what we're all about!
With that...ask us anything!

<TITLE> Workout Wednesday - Discuss and Share Exercise Routines, Techniques, etc </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 06:13:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ##Daily Discussion Threads

----

Curated daily at 12:15am ET, the Reddit Ultimate discussion threads aim to cut down on excess content and to provide an opportunity for people to discuss interesting topics in more detail. Today is **Wednesday,** so our discussion will focus on asking about and sharing workout routines and technique questions.

**Please upvote this post** so it can be seen by folks browsing outside of /r/ultimate.

----

In this thread...

- **You could ask about workout routines:** What is your current fitness plan? What routines are best for ultimate? How can I work on my explosiveness? What are your favorite bodyweight exercises?
- **You could ask about specific technique:** What is the best way to perform a deadlift? Where should I keep my feet when squatting? How can I work all of my core muscles at once?
- **You could discuss advanced concepts:** What are some good goals to set for me? What track workouts are great for large groups? How can I use field sprints to better condition myself?
- **And you could share what works for you!** This thread can be a valuable feedback opportunity for proposing exercise sets, critiquing form, etc. What are you proud of? What needs work?

Even if you have nothing to share, check back often and help answer questions!

Note: Content in this thread doesn't just have to be gym-related  it can be field, track, pool, beach etc. Can also be drills in addition to workouts, nutrition discussion, etc as long as it relates to physical development.

## General Guidelines for Students 

* You will be making the first contact by sending a PM or replying to the mentor of your choice.  

* Come prepared. What do you want to take away from this? Is there anything the mentors can review?  

* Know your issues: In which areas do you struggle?  

* You must understand that getting better is all about yourself. Bring your best attitude.  

* Be motivated. The results are proportional to the amount of effort you put in practice.  

* Mentors are here to assist and help you with the difficulties you encounter. This is not a way to find high elo Duo Queue partners.

----------  

## General Guidelines for Mentors  

* You will accept players of your choice as students upon receiving their messages. The responsibility to make further contact and set up times falls on you.  

* Be clear as to what you want to do for your student(s) in your description: Review replays, lane together in normals, experiment and practice in custom games, simply answer questions/discuss, etc.  

* Try to organize your "sessions" by having specific themes. You do not want to overburden someone with too much information at once.  

* Give yourself discussion prompts to avoid losing your trail of thought. Slow down, clarify your opinions and make sure the student understands.  

* It is important to always promote a positive attitude and mentality towards playing and improving.

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi dank memestars. Just letting you losers know that it's been a weeK, so every GPU on the market has droppedat. The question is, how much?

               

Of course, that still means my GPUs are still worth more than yours, as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

Always remember to consult the [ShaQtusTM]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUcSioaXTFU) and review the [golden rule](http://i.imgur.com/54xA2ZZ.png) before making any purchases.

If posting de-stashes, you may either link your /r/asianbeautyexchange crosspost (recommended), or your blog sale if you are hosting it there.  However, if you are selling on an external site we do ask that like /r/asianbeautyexchange, you post a picture with the items + a paper with your name on it for authenticity.

<DATE> 2017-05-10 06:02:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Welcome to r/WiiU's weekly casual conversation thread!

This thread's purpose is to be a lounge: a place for the Reddit Wii U community to relax, hang out, chat aimlessly, discuss mostly off-topic material (current events, sports, etc.), and maybe get to know each other a little better as people.

As for general rules for this thread:

- we ask to keep the content of your conversations PG-13 at best
- keep meta content (meaning about the subreddit in general) to a minimum
- have fun!

We also have an official /r/WiiU [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/0cNxEzSKWDJEtUXB)! Make sure you check it out if you wish to chat with your fellow WiiUsers.

**Guidelines #1, #2 and #12 are in full effect.**

 ## [Upcoming Trial: Daily Highlight Threads](https://redd.it/69q0v7)
 
 Hi all,
 
 This week (starting Sunday night) we'll be trialing a potential rule change: Highlight threads are not permitted, and must instead be posted in a Daily Highlight Thread.  If this change is made, this thread will be prominently displayed either in the Important section, via a banner, or some other way.
 
 For the next week we'll be doing a sticky thread each day, and subject1093 will direct users who submit highlights to this thread, and removing them.
 
 We know this change will have a drastic effect on the landscape of the front page, and we also know changes like this make the mobile app experience less intuitive, and a bit more difficult even for desktop users. We're eager to hear feedback at the end of the week. 
 
 Whether or not this change goes through depends on many factors, but we'd like to see how this trial goes regardless of our intent to pursue the change.

---

**Episode Synopsis:** In the exciting penultimate episode leading into next week's season finale, Coulson and the team's victory in the Framework is short-lived, as an even deadlier enemy looms against them all.

**Kevin Tancharoen** is the brother of showrunner Maurissa Tancharoen, and is known for his work on the webseries Mortal Kombat: Legacy. He has directed various other movies and TV episodes before, and has most recently worked on The Flash.

He has directed eight episodes for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. before:

- Face my Enemy
- One of Us
- The Dirty Half Dozen
- Purpose in the Machine
- Spacetime
- Ascension
- The Laws of Inferno Dynamics

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Post a picture of what you're wearing to get suggestions, feedback and constructive criticism from the community. When posting, please:

* Include what the attire is for (work, school, going out, etc.)

* Include a front-on, full-body picture with your hands at your sides. Multiple pictures from different angles can be helpful, but aren't necessary. There's more info on taking good self-shots [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/16rwft/how_to_take_better_self_pics_for_mfa/).

 Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but keep it constructive/factual.  It takes balls to post pictures of yourself on the Internet, the least you can do is accord the same courtesy as you would to someone in real life.

Fit checks and "How'd I do" questions are a great use of this thread (although they can also go in the daily Outfit Feedback  amp; Fit Check thread). Other example questions:

* Could someone take the chest measurement for a small J.Crew oxford?
* Is there a place with full measurements for Naked  amp; Famous jeans?
* What slim-fitting green cords do you recommend?
* Where do I find a military surplus peacoat online?

<TITLE> [Mod] Simple Questions - the weekly stupid questions thread! - Week Beginning May 10, 2017 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 03:00:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Welcome to the weekly stupid questions thread!** This is a place to ask any questions that you may have -- moronic or otherwise.

**Anyone may post a question, and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer.** If your question is more specific to you, we recommend providing details.

<TEXT> Hey gainers. Today is Success Sunday!

This is a place to post something that you accomplished this week, or any personal triumphs, and get encouragement/motivation from your fellow users. Some examples:

 * This week I set a personal record on my bench press of 150 lbs!

 * I was struggling to meet my daily calories for a while, but I finally was able to reach my goal on Friday!

 * One of my friends complimented me on the size of my arms

 * This week I ripped my favorite pair of shorts -- it was awesome.

We encourage you all to post any triumph -- big or small.

<TITLE> Food Club Bets (May 10, 2017) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 01:03:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A thread for people to casually post their bets, discuss, ask questions, etc.

#Food Club Resources
       
* Place Bets: http://www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=bet
* Collect Winnings: http://www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=collect
* Food Club Guide: http://www.neopets.com/~Jawsnapper0991
* Food Club stats (odds, food adjustment, previous round data): http://foodclub.daqtools.info/
* A bunch of Food Club betters: http://www.neopets.com/~Hostia

#Using Tables

/u/diceroll123 speaking! Instead of shorthand *(see header and content below)*, a prettier and easier alternative to posting bets has been made dead simple by me. :D

I've made a simple userscript to turn your [current bets](http://www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=current_bets) into a formatted reddit table!

If you have Chrome: get [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) to use it! Greasemonkey for Firefox, and I'm unsure about other browsers.

Link for the userscript here: https://gist.github.com/diceroll123/04fb835539530038795e (Press the "Raw" button and it should ask you to add it to your collection of userscripts.)

You'll see a button under your [current bets](http://www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=current_bets) table, click that and copy/paste here. [](/slorg)

#Understanding Shorthand

Pirate A x (Pirate B, Pirate C) is shorthand for Pirate A x Pirate B and Pirate A x Pirate C.

Similarly, Pirate A x (Pirate B, Pirate C) x (Pirate D, Pirate E) translates to:

Pirate A x Pirate B x Pirate D

Pirate A x Pirate B x Pirate E

Pirate A x Pirate C x Pirate D

Pirate A x Pirate C x Pirate E

Basically, [FOIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOIL_method) it out.

<TEXT> 
**Step Challenge**

StrideKick allows people from multiple fitness devices to compare steps (Fitbit, Garmin, Apple watch etc.), i've setup a weekly competition starting today and repeating each week. Anyone can join at any point and have their steps synced (ie. Join on a sunday and all your steps will be from the wednesday)

In order to join the challenge, you can send me a message with your email BUT the easiest way is to sign up to stridekick and then add me at a friend at https://stridekick.com/users/Itch0 and then join the challenge. If this is too much of a headache then we'll just do our own respective fitbit/garmin challenges.

Direct link to the challenge: https://stridekick.com/app#/segments/leaderboard?challenge_id=50624

--------------------------
**Fitness Discussion**

Weekly discussion about fitness goals, PB's, accomplishments or questions.

Sharing is obviously completely optional. For example of sharing sake;

I'm 6'5"
102.5 kg
Roughly 20% BF
I want to get to 90 kg
I eat: Fried chicken

This is a good chance for people who may be starting or have neglected fitness related goals to ask questions or just take some insight from other users.

------------------------

**Where the fuck do I start? I fucking want to do something but I really have no idea.**

If you're in this category, feel free to chime in. Or private message me, i've got experience (not professional, went to study medicine but decided I wanted to do graphic design because i'm a fucking moron)

There are multiple people I know on here that are involved in fitness or even just regular footy players who may know a thing or two.

<TEXT> We changed our name to r/POTUSWatch a week ago, that was because we decided we're going to track President Donald Trump's successors too and because other subs have refused to help us due to our name containing the word "Trump" so we didn't really have much choice. We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 
Erath Connect is a social media network intended for use by those in New Erath. Here citizens can post their thoughts and memories with others being able to reply just like any other social media site.

A new thread will go up every Monday at 8pm UTC but you are free to comment on the current thread throughout the week. By default the thread sorts newest comments first and it is recommended to leave it that way particularly if a thread has a lot of comments.

By default any posts to Erath Connect are public, thus visible for anyone to see in the city or even those outside the city. If you wish for a character's post to only be visible to their friends put **(Private)** at the start of the comment.

Remember Erath Connect is a social media network so characters should use and speak on it like they would on any social media network.

* **(8)** non-stop action and/or lots of goals

* **(9)** game of the year contender
