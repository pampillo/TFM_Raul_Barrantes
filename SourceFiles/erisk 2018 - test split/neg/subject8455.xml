<TEXT> Probably, this is one of the options I thought of as well! I am a scaredy cat, that's why I got scared, it doesn't necessarily mean it was something sinister. It was just creepy and I sincerely have no explanation of it! It could have been a person, of course, but come on... Too weird! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys! I rarely post here as not many scary or weird things happen to me, things with no explanation, but last month such a thing did happen and I would like to share in hope that you can help me figure out what it might have been (though I'm not sure we'll find out ever).

So, me and my boyfriend were on our way to his hometown for Easter. He picked me up after work, which was a little after 7 PM and by the time we drove off it was past 8. His hometown is three hours away by car, so... yeah.

Somewhere after we passed the capital and continued to the little villages, the heavy rain had ceased and we were looking for a secluded place on the road to take a pee. We found a spot that was a bit aside from the road and he pulled over. The spot was on a lonely part of the road between two villages. 

We came out of the car and were just breathing the fresh rainy air, when, out of the woods, we hear a man's voice singing. 

Now, I'm from Bulgaria. When I say "singing", it sounded like a folklore singing typical for our homeland. The voice just echoed through the woods and it sounded very close. We just looked at each other in dismay as it kept going for like 15 seconds. My first thought was, here's a drunkie celebrating the holiday, but somewhere in the middle of listening I started getting creeped out. 

We are in the middle of the road, with forest on both its sides. The street lights are like 5 meters away from one another and, so far, only one car had passed us by. Who the hell could be outside, in the forest, in quarter to midnight, in a cold and rainy weather?!

My boyfriend did his business, but I was freaked and almost refused to go. But I did, and it felt like a man would jump out of the trees at any second, with old gun and knife, big moustaches and clothing, like it was when we were under slavery and such men were hunted through the mountains while fighting for freedom. I honestly tell you I did think that!

It sounded as a person who had come back from the ages and was roaming the forest. It was scary!!!

When we got back in the car, my brain started working. First, it was almost midnight, and I know that because my mom had called me to check on us little before we got off to pee and I checked the time. Second, if that man was drunk, he was singing way too accurately for a drunkie. In fact, he had not a single wrong note. And third, I saw no light, not a single sparkle of flickering light through the trees. If there was a person there, and they were even a bit close, we'd see flashlight, house lights from windows, something. But no. 

We reached our destination safely and searched the history of the area. We found only like two sentences about a warrior, a haydut, as we call them, by the name Milenko who was slaughtered in one of the villages. He was part of the opposition back then.

On our way back, during broad daylight, we took the same very road in search of any sign of home life. We saw that the trees weren't as thick as they appeared at night, and we could actually see through the other side. There was a field with a small den. No houses. No tents. No signs of life. There's nothing there but open air. 

It still boggles my mind. It was absolutely real, we could both hear it and, given the circumstances, it could have been something else, but not human. I mean, what are the chances of two random people stopping by to pee in the middle of nowhere and someone decieds to sing just then?! And may I add, it never sung again apart from those 15 seconds.

What do you guys think? If any of you have any suggestions, that would be awesome. We'll never find out for sure, but still. Thank you.

I'll leave here a link to illustrate how the voice sounded, minus the instrumental music. This manner of singing is authentic to us, it's our musical heritage.

And then I had to admit I didn't remember anything, apart from that guy's hat... which is ridiculous... And it was pretty dark, due to the only street lamp nearby... There's another thing, too, our police doesn't bother with these things at all. Either you take care of your ass, or you go down, sadly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So a few years ago I was at a club with my best friend, but for some reason my mood was really bad and I wanted to go home. All went over the edge when a guy who was dancing crazily accidentally burned my hand with his cigarette. Even though he apologized, I decided that was that, and I was heading home.

I left my best friend with some people we both knew. It was winter, was really cold, and 2 in the morning. 
Now, my home town is pretty small; the club is located at the very centre, and there are always cabs waiting for clients nearby.

I thought I was gonna grab a cab, since I lived in a neighbourhood away from the centre; it was a good half an hour walk home. 

But there were no cars present at the spot. I figured it was because of the cold, but my phone was down and I couldn't call for one. Given my already pissed off state, I just waved the whole thing off and decided to walk home anyway.

Biggest mistake of my life so far.

Now bear in mind, again, it was winter. I was wearing beggy jeans, a huuuge jacket with even huger hood covering my entire face, and sneakers - from the looks of me one could never tell if I was a boy or a girl.
So I'm walking down the street, and soon I reach a point where it connects to two other streets from left and right, and the whole thing forms something like a roundabout.

Suddenly from the street on the left two guys emerge. I immediately get a sick sensation in my stomach, like I KNOW something is about to go wrong in an instant, oh, the famous female instinct. The next second my fears get confirmed when one of them starts crossing the street and coming my way. I still keep walking, we're about to pass each other by, when suddenly this motherf**** grabs me by the jacket and slams me onto the wall with my back against it. All of this happens in the spam of few seconds, and I'm so shocked I cannot believe it. He looked drunk, all I could muster to say to him was, "Get off of me!" 

Then my glance falls onto the other guy (who was much much bigger by the way), and he puts his finger on his lips, making a shushing gesture.

There and then I knew I was done. There was not a single car driving by, not a single living human being around. You can't imagine the pounding of my heart, but it was adrenaline that saved me. 

Wearing puffy winter gloves, I lift my weak hand formed into a pathetic fist, and hit the guy directly in the nose so hard I hear a cracking sound. Next split of a second I realize I gotta run, because if he grabs me again, there will be no letting go this time. 

So while he was holding his nose I sprinted away, and in my panic I crossed the road and ran by the bigger guy, who just stood and watched me in awe. 

I ran and I ran, not slipping on the icy road even a bit, I felt like my feet weren't touching the ground.. I was horrified.

Almost half the way though I stopped to catch my breath and suddenly got SO pissed at these two that I almost made a turn back to crack their heads.

NO ONE has the right to attack people!!! You can't just think you can go out and find someone you can assault! 
At this moment I thought that even if there were like 10 big guys surrounding me I could beat them all, that's how pissed I was. 

I walked the rest of the way, no one ever chased me. I wondered if I should tell my Mom this... I did, and she almost got a heart attack:} 

To this day I believe it was a combination of luck and adrenaline that saved me that night; luck, because it was the thinner of them who attacked me, and adrenaline, because without it I wouldn't be able to make such an accurate and strong punch on that idiot's face (I'm not a fighter and if need ever came to defend myself I'd be dead probably).

I hope they remember me and think twice before trying anything stupid with other girls. It still baffles me though, how they decided I was in fact a girl. Something must have given me away. </TEXT>

Now, when you said "straight jacket", I'm thinking a delusional escapee. Do  you know of any mental institutions around? What bothers me though is how easily it got inside, and how it seems to do it around the same hour at night, thus saying "nope" to the human being option... Don't stay there alone, EVER! And do tell your roommate.

<TEXT> This is most likely sleep paralysis. Some people experience it very tensely and occasionally, like you, others rarely or never do. There's a pattern of reappearing visions (shadow / man in black, old hag, aliens, ghost) when you got a heavy case. You might want to see a therapist or neurologist about it.

<TEXT> Hey, guys. 
I wanted to share a story from my childhood. Might not be so scary, but it's factual. 
We were still living in the apartment where I spent most of my childhood. I was about 10 years old at the time, and still shared a room with my little sister. 
One night I couldn't fall asleep right away, so I kept tossing and turning constantly. Our room wasn't so dark, as we lived on the 3rd floor and street lights were painting the walls.
Now, the door of our room is half-made of glass. Both mine and my sister's beds were put in such an angle that it was no problem for us to keep an eye on it whatever position we slept in.
So, I'm tossing and turning, when I happen to look at the door.
There I see our mother, just standing on the other side of the glass, looking through. (Even though it was dark, so what the hell was she looking at anyway).
Or at least I thought it was her. At the time I did, since the figure wore a night gown similar to one of my mom's, with blue flowers on it. 
So, a few seconds after I saw it, it turned away and started walking towards the kitchen. I thought that Mom was thirsty or something, but I didn't see the kitchen light turning on (I would have, because it would illuminate the hall and I'd see it through the glass door). Nor did I hear a sound whatsoever.
I thought it was strange, and the next day I asked Mom if she had got up during the night, and she denied. Plus, turned out she wore a different sleep ware then.
Till this day I can't explain what this was; a ghost? Or just a contorted vision of my half-asleep mind? I never had any experience similar to it ever again; this was the closest I've ever encountered to might having been paranormal.
What do you think? </TEXT>
