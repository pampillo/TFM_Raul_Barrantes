<TITLE> Has my golden puppy stopped growing? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 03:04:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Our golden retriever turned 7 months 4 weeks ago. At that time he weighed in at 43.8 lbs and when he was weighed this past weekend, he had not gained an ounce. I realize his growth does slow down at this age, but we were expecting to still see some growth. Both of his parents are relatively large goldens - 70+ lbs. We're beginning to wonder if he might just end up being on the small side... Has he just plateaued for a bit and will hit another growth spurt?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> 8 year old central air coil - still good? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-11 03:47:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I purchased my house in June and the previous home owner installed a new Tempstar furnace 8 years ago and installed the coil for central air. They did not hook up a central air unit outside but we are looking at doing that this year. The refrigerant is R-22 which I heard might not be good anymore. Will I need to buy a new coil with the central air unit?

Thanks!  </TEXT>

Does anyone have any ideas what the issue could be? When I hold the floater up the pump will drain the water completely, but it will not do so on it's own. This only began in the last couple days, previously my sump pump would run only as needed and for longer periods of time. Please help!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a junior in high school the graduating class above me pulled a few pranks. My high school had a statue in front of the building with Nicolaus Copernicus' head on it and early in the year the head went missing. We went almost the entire year with it missing and administrators had no clue where it went. Sometime later that school year, around February or March, the head appeared out of nowhere attached to the top of a sign with our school name (about 20-25 tall) with the head attached to it and a giant dildo glued to the forehead. They never found out who it was. That same group then photoshopped the faces of two assistant principals onto a photo from a porno and dropped a ton of them in the halls all around the school after 9th period that day. In the photo the male principal's face was on the female body getting fucked by the the male body with the female principal's head on it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up in the Buffalo area and recently moved to the Town of Tonawanda. Nice to see another person from the area in this sub! 

I remember when the MLK splash pad was such a big deal, it seemed like Byron Brown was on the news ever other day bragging about how big it was. I think construction was delayed by months on that project too. 

It's unbelievable the amount of violent crime that goes on in the city on a daily basis. The areas of the east side where a lot of the problems are look like some post apocalyptic streets out of a movie. Byron has done nothing to address it, he just wants to look good for the camera.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just went through this process as a first time homebuyer. Homes have gone extremely quick since we began looking last fall. My fianc and I had an offer accepted the beginning of this month which happened to be the first one we made an offer on. We had to move really quickly though. The home was listed on a Tuesday, we toured it on a Thursday and our offer was accepted Saturday with two competing offers. No open house even too place, just private showings. We did go just above asking price and fortunately got the house. We were looking in Kenmore, Town of Tonawanda and Amherst, we ended up in the Town of Tonawanda not far from North Buffalo. We're really happy with the area. The lower taxes compared to Kenmore will be really nice too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like most Sabres fans I've always been a big fan of the blue and gold jerseys, but as I've gotten older I grew to appreciate the goat head jerseys much more. My only aud experience was actually the unveiling of those jerseys since I was still pretty young when they were playing there. The alternate red jersey with the swords was awesome, I wish they would have kept it even after they got rid of the goat jerseys.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely agree. I've been thinking about this throughout the season and I think it's become pretty clear O'Reilly is next in line. Last season I was wondering if Girgensons may get the C at some time in the next couple years, but it doesn't look that way anymore. I don't really think there's a great choice afterward, players like Gorges or Moulson are not realistic. The others that might be good are still a few years off in their careers from reaching that level.  </TEXT>

Jerry and George are on the merge of having a successful TV show, only to have it taken away. Great references to situations they encountered throughout the series. I also wasn't left feeling as though there could have been more to offer fans, they wrapped up the series on their owns terms and without leaving a lot of unanswered questions.  </TEXT>
