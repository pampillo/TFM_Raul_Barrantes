<TEXT> You're certainly not alone in feeling that way. When someone in an authority position seems disappointed in me or scolds me, I get very emotional. I was pulled over for driving on a suspended recently - it's a long story but I accept full responsibility. The cop let into me and I started bawling, which I do when I get "yelled" at and/or I'm embarrassed. You're certainly not alone in that feeling but I think that's what the officer was probably going for - making you feel guilty and shameful to the point that you won't do it again. But keep in mind that it's really not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. Learn from your mistake and make it right, then move on! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently read an article about electric shock drowning that freaked me out. I've spent a lot of time on the lake over the course of my life, but knew nothing about it. Link to article: http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/04/what_is_electric_shock_drownin.html </TEXT>

<TEXT> We typically schedule in 30 minute increments. I work with three doctors and they sound similar to yours - one typically moves quickly and is usually out early and rarely out late; one is pretty consistently on time and occasionally runs over; the other runs over most times. It's not perfect but I think by scheduling 30 minutes, it evens out over the course of the day! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much agree with everyone else. Cats definitely operate on their own terms - forcing a cat to do anything will only make it worse. I would try to engage with toys/playtime and food! The little fatty must like food so being the one to feed can help you establish a bond and role in the cat's life. Also sitting quietly and allowing the cat to come to you, without eye contact might help. Oh, and the Jackson Galaxy slow blink. Very slowly close your eyes and reopen them without making eye contact. Look up Jackson Galaxy - I think he's a kitty god. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for sharing your experience! The whole time I was reading I was wondering if you'd found your son - I hope someday you do and someday soon at that. It's nice to know you want contact with both and I hope my birth mother is the same. I like the idea that simpler is better; I'm not in a huge hurry and only recently have I really started to consider searching. I think my first step will be calling the adoption agency to see if she's left any information for me and to request my own copy of my records. I need to have them again before I start searching so I'm sure of all the information. Thanks again. It's cool to know someone else out there has experienced multi-generational adoption! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for the information! It's been very helpful. Just joined DNA detectives and I'm digging into it now. I think I'm going to start with 23andMe as I'm most curious about ethnicity right now. My SO said he'd gift me an Ancestry.com test if and when when I decide I'm ready to look for family. Thanks again! </TEXT>

<TITLE> My birth mother is also adopted... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-27 22:46:15 </DATE>

<TEXT> Background: I was adopted as a baby. My A parents are amazing and I knew from day one that I was adopted. They also gave me free access to my adoption records my entire life. Every few months or years we'd pull out the records and look over them. In my late teens and early twenties, I didn't look at my records for several years but a few years ago my mom, boyfriend, and I looked over them again. I was reminded then that my birth mother herself was adopted, something I had completely forgotten until then. She was a teen when she got pregnant and my B father was out of the picture before I was born. The records indicate that because my B mother had such a positive experience being adopted herself, she felt that it was the right thing to do for me. I have become more curious over the past year or so about my ethnicity, as well as my B parents in general. I am considering taking a DNA test soon and have asked my parents for a copy of my records. 

Now that I've decided to potentially actively pursue finding them or information about them, I have concerns about how my B mother being adopted herself will affect my search. Has anyone else been through a similar situation? How will it affect my search? If I find, for example, a distant cousin on my B mother's side through a DNA test, that person may not even know she exists, for all I know. I don't know whether I'd should seek information about my B mother's B parents or my B mother's A parents or both! It makes things a bit more complicated and I would greatly appreciate any insight you all have to give! </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's the best DNA test for someone who is adopted? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I was adopted at a young age and have been doing a lot of research before I commit to a type of DNA test, but have found conflicting information on which test would be best. At this point, I'm leaning towards Ancestry.com's DNA test, but would like to know your recommendations for someone who is adopted? I am mostly interested in learning about my ethnicity but would also be open to using a DNA test to potentially find family members.

Edit: spelling and grammar </TEXT>
