<TEXT> I agree, to an extent. I'm mixed-black, so I'm very thick on my bottom half. If he's too small, he literally can't get in me from behind (which is my favorite position), but 6-7 inches on full hard is my sweet spot (I realize 6-7 may not seem small to some, but when you've encountered far to many 9-12 inch dicks that are literally impossible to take, 6-7 is a godsend!)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've looked them up right on their website. There used to be one woman who seems to be of South Asian ancestry, but she's no longer reading for them. 

And I'm not sure if they're volunteers or if they're paid (I would imagine they get compensation now due to the shows success), but I think that's irrelevant to my question. 

I've heard David make an announcement at the beginning of a show that they get lots of interest from people wanting to read for them but that they aren't looking for new voice actors. I find it hard to believe that zero people of color have reached out with interest in joining their ranks. So if they have discovered their actors solely through a voluntary process, the basis for your response simply doesn't make sense. 

As a mixed-black queer woman, I'm fully aware that there's no such thing as "sounding" a race, ethnicity, sexual preference, or even a gender/sex etc. But it would be cool to hear some accents that aren't white British or white Irish or white Canadian or white American. It would be cool to hear African accents, Asian Accents. It would even be cool to hear stories read by black and brown American folx with certain vernaculars that some might say are stereotypical as people who use certain vernaculars do exist and as a person who grew up in and around it, the "hood" has some scary happenings/stories. It would be cool to hear an extremely effeminate male voice actor read for them. It would be cool to hear a gender-ambiguous voice. It would be cool to hear stories by and about POC and LGBTQIA folx and the things that only we experience. 

And for every one listener that would stop listening due to their inability to relate to anything that isn't white and hetero, I know the show would gain two more listeners who would be stoked on the representation. 

I also want to note that I don't think anyone who controls anything on the show is at all racist or intentionally excluding anyone, but I do think they simply aren't fully cognizant of how important representation is, especially when you're getting as big as NoSleep is getting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not really offended, per say. Just curious is all. 

If Eurocentricity and heteronormativity offended me, I would spend my life in a state of offense. I like the straights and the whites! Many of friends and family members are straight and white. I adore the voice actor roster and the stories NoSleep picks. It would just be cool to have some variation. 

And I actually just wrote my first story. As my writing gets better, I plan to submit directly to the podcast.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Los Bastardos: Bastard #1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 20:44:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You have to believe me when I tell you that I never meant to murder anyone. But he kept trying to put is filthy hands up my shirt! I repeatedly told the bastard "NO!" Like so many before him, he persisted. As I sat there nearly giving up my protest out of fear that, if I didn't, the situation might quickly turn more violent and deadly dangerous... it was as if every hurt, every bruise, every assault, every ignored "no," every removal of rights and autonomy and agency ever inflicted on any woman suddenly became my own. 

I could feel the rage in my being reaching critical mass and something inside me broke wide open. 

As bastard #1 roughly pawed at my breasts and drunkenly drooled all over my neck, I felt around in my nightstand for the Montblanc Bonheur Fountain Pen my aunt had gifted to me last Eid. I'm quite sure he thought I was searching for a condom for his undoubtedly minuscule dick. "Got it!" I thought to myself as I gently removed the pen's cap. Then, with all the force I could muster from my 5'2" frame, I jabbed the Montblanc directly into what I hoped was his jugular. I pushed it in deep, twisted it around a bit, and swiftly pulled it back out. If the massive spurts of blood emitting from his neck were any indication, I had successfully found that precious vein. 

He looked at me with wide-eyed puzzlement, I stared directly back at him with wide-smile amusement. 

"You stabbed me, you stupid bitch!" were his last words before collapsing. I watched as he continued to bleed, slower now, onto my floor. I listened to his breaths becoming fainter and fainter. I headed to the kitchen to borrow my carnivorous roommate's meat cleaver and returned to my room, where he was lying on the floor, unfortunately still gasping for oxygen.

I stood over him, stared at him, then sat down on his chest with the meat cleaver in my right hand. With my left, I poked and prodded and stuck my fingers into the gaping hole I made just ten minutes before.

I took stock of the situation in which I found myself and began slicing into the flesh and bones of his neck until his head was completely detached from his pathetic body. His eyes were still wide open and his face still bore the signs of sheer terror. 

Sitting atop his lifeless (and now headless) body, I never felt more invigorated. And the release of the kill was absolutely magnificent, I tell you! Every fear, every hurt... all things fell away. I held the power.

I was almost giddy with euphoria until I realized I still had work to do on behalf of bastard #1's mistakes. Ugh. Even in death, men are writhing disappoints. I mean, he didn't even have the decency to bleed out on a blanket or something. Nope, right onto my gleaming, pristine pre-war hardwood. The bastard. 

"You've made such a fucking mess!" I shouted at his corpse as I set about cleaning up after him.

<TEXT> Also, I must add that many western women often struggle for years to get a man to even propose. Whereas in majority Islamic countries and in Islam in general, marriage is easy to come by. So if a woman badly wants marriage and family, the western way of dating around often endlessly would seem like a miserable time to women who are brought up knowing that they will easily get married and obtain that family life quickly.

<TEXT> As an ex-Muslim revert, I'd say the only thing I loved about my brief time as a Muslim vs my life before and after is not having to fucking work! That is one area where Muslim women who are married to men who earn a decent living have it made. There's literally no expectation for a woman to work even if her husband is broke and jobless, he must find a way to support her. I mean, even housework and cooking aren't required of Muslim women (unless poor or from a culture where that's expected.) But Saudi women, for example, who are at least Middle class... most have full-time maids (and nannies if they have youngsters) and full-time drivers and really aren't expected to do much other than pop out babies, maybe cook, and shop (which is why there are so many malls here). This is true for all of the GCCs. 

Yeah, that part is enviable. But it's ultimately not worth the immense restrictions on women and on one's humanity in general.

<TEXT> Again, Saudi is an awful place to live for many reasons. But you have to remember that much of the exceptionally wild shit you hear about (such as beheading for apostatizing) is propaganda like everything else. Yes, they behead people here. Mostly for murder, rape, child molestation, etc. America still has the death penalty, and the American method is far more barbaric than a swift decapitation and much less effective. Often death row inmates do not die painlessly or quickly in American prisons as they are giving drug concoctions that do not really work since European pharmaceutical companies have refused to continue supplying America with the proper drugs to execute people. 

I can assure you that I am not going to be arrested or beheaded for speaking ill of The KSA in the privacy of my home just a few blocks from the American Embassy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm still in Saudi Arabia for a couple more weeks and I was telling my "therapist" here about why I'm leaving and how even though I haven't been Muslim super long, I'm grappling with feelings of indecision regarding leaving it (Islam, not The KSA. I am running out of The KSA on the day of my flight) due to it having become my life and all my most loved friends being Muslim, etc. I was explaining to him some of the reasons, like how people glare in Islamic countries if you laugh in public and how in general I've been told by many Muslims "you laugh too much." And his response: "My sister, I must warn you that too much laughing is Haram. There is Hadith about it" 

WHAT THE FUCK? Is this true? What's the Hadith? And why in the hell is laughing not okay?! Are you supposed to be joyless in Islam?!  </TEXT>

I was secretly addicted to them, for the second time, for the last year. And I've just emerged from a month long withdrawal. About 5 days into withdrawal, I started feeling like 'what the FUCK am I doing here?!' I started feeling actual feelings again and I stopped believing in whatever bullshit I somehow found myself espousing before. I can't explain it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only been Muslim for 1.5 years and have only been married for 6 months, but I am miserable. My husband is a wonderful man. He's sweet, gentle, and understanding. But he would never leave Islam. He's happy in it. It's been his way of life for 20 years, since he was just 15. For me, it is oppressive and constricting and bleak. It feels akin to nihilism and I absolutely cannot stand it. I do not know why I even took my shahada. Now, I'm in the KSA and trying to figure out how to leave without hurting my husband. I don't want to break his heart, but I am so unhappy. 

How did you all finally leave Islam? How do I make my husband understand without hurting him?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It reminds me so much of scenes in Sound Of My Voice!!! 

Also, in episode 2 when Abel, Nancy, and OA are getting a family photo taken, a heavily medicated OA is looking down and the photog is saying stuff to Nancy and Abel and his words become muffled as the camera zooms to OA. And then we hear the photog clearly say "towards the sound of my voice, honey" 

Since Brit and Zal also made Sound of My Voice, they could have just thrown in these things as little Easter eggs for superfans (like myself) to find. But I'm wondering if there might be some actual connection between the two projects. I don't want to give any spoilers for those who haven't seen Sound of My Voice, but the story arc does mirror The OA in certain aspects!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know others have pointed out all of the fish/fishing references, but I haven't seen mention of the many uses of water as a theme, as well as feet. This might be a stretch, but the astrological sign Pisces symbol/constellation is two fish swimming in opposite directions, it is a water sign, the body part ruled by Pisces are the feet, and the word Pisces itself is the plural for fish in Latin. This could mean nothing, but wondering if anyone else noticed these things? 

Also, I'm rewatching the series now and I noticed in episode one, the nurse tells The OA that she has hypothermia. Further along in the series, Hap also mentions that The OA was almost hypothermic after she's been in his ND contraption. Any theories about these references? 

Also, I cannot recall a series that has ever moved me the way The OA has, like ever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Walaykum Salam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh, Akhi! 

Everyone has given you really good advice here, but no one has mentioned the fact that it is not permissible to be speaking to her directly. 

It's best for you to communicate strictly with her Wali and as someone else said, arrange to meet ASAP. With her Wali present, of course. And decide from there if you both want to have the Nikkah. 

Going about this any other way can lead to lots of haram. 

Speaking from experience! 

May Allah SWT make it easy for you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hm. I'm an American revert expat living in the KSA. Since I am a woman and married, I mostly pray at home, obviously. However, I have been to many a masjid. From California to New York and several states in between. Most of them have been absolutely one dimensional in regard to ethnicity, race,  and the like. So, my experience with western masjids hasn't been that of witnessing great diversity. 

Here in the Kingdom, however, just walking through Tamimi's I see brothers and sisters from every part of Allah's great, big creation. Westerners of every color, Asians from the southeast to the pacific islands, Africans, and of course Arabs. This is also true for the masjids I've had the chance to attend. 

So, idk, bro.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Salamulaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. 

Plucking the eyebrows is not permissible in Islam. It is called Al Namas. 

Abd-Allaah ibn Masood (radi Allah Tala Anhu) said: "I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) say: Allaah has cursed the woman who does tattoos and the one who has them done, the woman who plucks eyebrows (al-naamisah) and the one who has it done (al-mutanammisah), and the one who files her teeth for the purpose of beauty, altering the creation of Allaah. 

(al-Bukhaari, 5931; Muslim, 2125) 



However, in Fatwa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, it is stated:

There is no sin on a woman if she removes hair on her upper lip, thighs, calves and arms. This is not part of the tanammus (plucking) that is forbidden.

(Fatwa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 5/194, 195) 

The Committee was asked:

What is the Islamic ruling on plucking the hair between the eyebrows?

They replied:

It is permissible to pluck it, because it is not part of the eyebrows.

(Fatwa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 5/197) 

Of course, Allah knows best, but I hope this helps!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. In our Deen, Allah SWT isn't male or female. Allah is not human and Allah's human creations do not resemble Him other than having attributes like Him. That is, eyes with which to see and ears with which to hear, etc. But in Islam, we don't believe Allah is some human looking male with a big, white beard looking over us. That is an egotistical and patriarchal Christian way of thought, of which we do not subscribe to. 

Allah is infinite and Allah created everything; time, space, heaven, earth, male, female, jinn, animals, sun, moon, stars, etc. Therefore, he could never be likened to humans. Human beings are finite, and Allah is beyond our comprehension.  </TEXT>
