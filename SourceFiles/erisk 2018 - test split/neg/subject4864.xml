<TEXT> What a wonderful question! What is your criteria for knowing a person is enlightened when you meet them?
I guess a person who claims to be enlightened may be suspect - it's like someone saying "I'm a humble person."
Having a goal to be enlightened seems counter productive since it's a state of being - goals are in the future and enlightenment happens now.
I have my doubts that most of us (myself included) can reach Nirvana as a conscious state of being, but I do believe we all have our moments of enlightenment. Once we become conscious of it, it's gone ... until it comes back. </TEXT>

I guess I should have just not replied instead of engaging you and getting myself all worked up. Look, I believe what I believe from what I have studied. I am by no means enough of an authority to make a scientific case for astrology, so I have to bow out of this discussion because I have nothing of value to offer you in this subject.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prove you wrong about what? You are going on about how fake astrology is to a forum full of astrologers. Nobody here or anywhere owes you an explanation about the validity of astrology, and no one here thinks "oh, maybe rlcrew is right".  You are an insolent ass demanding that we show you astrology is real or you're not going to believe. I promise you, nobody here gives a crap if you believe in it or not, nor does anyone here need to defend astrology to you. I don't need to prove you wrong in front of everyone because everyone here believes ... so we already think you are wrong.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because you said that none of the astrologers can give you a thumbnail theory. I question you coming into this with an open mind. People in this subreddit love to talk astrology. Try and find some scrap of evidence you can believe and then ask a question based on that. Like "Hey, I am new and am not sure how I feel about it yet, but I did some research and found that Gemini people love to talk, I do know some talkative Geminis, but my friend John is not a talker, can someone explain why?" We believe in it (to different extents) because we have studied it for ourselves, not because someone proved it to us. I'm not a moderator,  but you're welcome here, but people's interactions with you will be based on your disposition.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are plenty of bad stories here and good ones as well, as I am sure you've bee reading since you got on here. Find yourself a mentor(s) who will take you under their wing. Always be humble, you have no idea what you do not know yet. This place is full of new CCNAs who are ready to redesign the Internet - the technology equivalent of a student who just finished psychology 101 want to diagnose their friends and family. The more humble you are the more willing people will be to teach you. 
You do not have to do this yourself. Post here often and learn to read through the chaff. Rant as well, we're in a business where we have to sell complex techical decisions to people who don't care to understand what we're talking about. Don't bother trying to impress your non-technical bosses with things they'll never understand. Always learn to communicate with them in their language  (money, productivity, etc.) Good luck and welcome! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, don't take this the wrong way (and I'll eat the downvotes) but games like Fallout and Diablo  have been dumbed down for the Console Tards - if you're a PC and console gamer you are not one. Developers reduce the complexity to appeal to a wider audience who they think don't want to bother with the details. 

I guess I am the opposite of a Console Tard - a PC Curmudgeon. I have 3 kids in the house and we have an Xbox One, two Xbox 360's, A Wii U, and two Wii's and I've only played the Wii. I'll be the guy playing Solitaire and Mine Sweeper when they finally stop making games for the PC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's a matter of perspective. The focus in this subreddit is networking and not IT management. I am an IT manager, but we are a small department, so I also do a ton of  networking (which is one of my passions), but my ultimate focus is delivering services to my users at the least cost to my organization. Moving services to the cloud makes sense to me, but we have 8 locations and over 3500 users - there will always be work to do on the network, desktop support, and help desk.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been in IT 22 years, currently an IT manager, but started as a bench tech back in 1994. I agree with some of the posts here that Brother has an agenda. With that said Network World is not a real networking magazine - it is free and funded by advertisers. Do not use it as a source of information with understanding that it's articles will always favor some vendor. 
IT is changing and more is going to the Cloud. You careers in networking are going to center around large companies and managed service providers (MSPs). Brother is not completely wrong in their assessment (despite  the fact that they are selling themselves as the solution).
I will eventually move as many servers and services out to the cloud as I can. If you told me 3 years ago that would be my strategy, I would have laughed. 
It doesn't mean that IT is gone, just changing.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, but you're wrong when it comes to Florida. I just sat with my daughter last Saturday for the required FL CCW class (I got mine last year and knew this instructor). Florida CCW applies to all concealed weapons that are not themselves illegal. This includes knives, brass knuckles, tasers, lightsaber, nunchucks, throwing stars, etc. 
They were arrested because they did not have a concealed weapons permit that was valid/honored in Florida. Disney cannot have you arrested if you are legally carrying and agree to leave, they can have you removed and banned from the premises.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great advice there. I want to agree especially on what foods or drinks set it off. For me onions - especially raw and tomato products are red light foods and give me the worst symptoms. I am NOT a qualified medical professional but when I first discovered it, I was on prilosec and zantec for 6 months to let whatever damage that has happened heal. I don't know enough about the long term effects of prilosec so I try and go off it every other month or so and just take Zantac. Don't suffer with it or not treat it - that can lead to serious problems down the road.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not sure what people new to networking think the CCNA is all about. The CCNA is an entry level certification. The basics of routing, switching, and the Cisco product line. When you are starting out you really have no idea what you don't know. That comes with time. At the CCNP level is when you start to get a solid networking foundation  (in addition to experience ). Do not mistake certifications for actual skill or experience. Asking what your certifications did or did not teach you is like asking what the SAT or ACT did or did not teach you. I wish when I was starting out that I wasn't so arrogant and walking around thinking that I knew everything because I was certified. Now, 22 years later as an IT manager, I want to give young people the chance, but so many of them think their hot stuff because they have a couple of certifications and it's a challenge to teach them anything because they think they already know it all. My advice, certifications are for your career and experience is for your job. Be humble and let someone with experience take you under their wing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We didn't pick him for his size or breed, it was the fact that he was a sweetheart. He came right up to us and licked our hands and interacted with us while the other bunnies moved as far away as they could get. Over the past 10 years we have had 5 bunnies and none of them were even remotely this friendly. Our last one just passed just before she turned 10 and was just plain ornery. I'm glad he will get bigger,  we have a poodle/rat terrier mix who is energetic, but not violent.  We're going to wait until Ozzy fills out a bit and see if they will get along.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stay humble and people will want to help you. I just found out an intern we had awhile back got fired from his job for his attitude. I talked with him about the same thing while he was here. But, when you're 21 years old and graduate at the top of your class, you think you know everything about everything. I've been in IT for 22 years - started out as a bench tech and been in networking for 16 and management for 8 (still work on the network if you're doing the math). There are still days that I feel like I have so much to learn, but I love that challenge. Got an Extreme 10gb switch for our Datacenter and it was nothing like the Enterasys and Cisco devices that I've worked with for so long, still, it felt like Christmas  (or Chanukah, Kwanzaa, Ramadan, Dwali, Tet, Festivus, or whatever you happily celebrate when you get a new piece of networking equipment.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The theory will help you immensely with troubleshooting. Understanding how all the different parts of a network from layers to how network services work will give you a complete picture. A friend of mind went to an interview and said that he never worked with a SonicWall. I let him know that it shouldn't have ended with that statement. I told him you understand ports and protocols and how a firewall works. He may have never worked with the syntax and configuration of the Sonicwall, but in the end, he knew how it worked. That's like being hired by a garage and saying that you never worked on a Toyota.  It's still a car and fundamentally works the same way of cars that you have worked on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sector was ruled by Cisco for over two decades. I know they have a wide product line, but their bread and butter has always been switches and routers sold at high margins. I've been in the IT business for 22 years and I've always felt that Cisco never wanted to cater to anyone but the Fortune 500 and everyone else who wanted to play had to pay. Now, Brocade, Extreme, and other smaller players are offering all of the same features for much less. I hate to see layoffs as much as the next guy, but Cisco has to reinvent at least part of themselves to stay competitive or they'll end up like Microsoft - trying to rule a market that they no longer control.  </TEXT>

Georgie (the marsh that just passed) was there first and outlasted them all. I just assumed that bunnies were more for looking than loving. It's nice to know that there are friendly, affectionate bunnies out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the problem with critical reviews, critics compare everything to their view of perfection instead of for what it is. Using the Godfather as a yardstick for measuring Happy Gilmore just doesn't do it justice. Critics would not give 5 stars to both of those movies because he or she is comparing them to each other. Happy Gilmore is a great movie for a sophomoric comedy and the Godfather is a great drama. I guess I am saying that's why ratings are crap and objective reviews should carry more weight.  </TEXT>

For someone who doesn't want to leave one in the chamber, it does make more sense to at least consider it based on where you are (as one person said on this thread "mitigate risk"). If you're at the house and you have small kids and just are not comfortable leaving one in the chamber that makes sense - you've decided to play the odds. On the other hand, if you're on a long drive and stop at rest stops, unknown places, or other questionable or nefarious locations, leaving one in the chamber would also be a wise way to play the odds.

<TEXT> I agree with some of the other posts that say it's pretty much like in most places. At some point moving up the chain, managers become less technical for a variety of reasons. Rank and file employees often do not know or understand what their managers do or why they do it. They judge their managers solely on technical merit.

I am not defending your managers because I don't know your environment. Over the last 22 years in IT, I have worked my way up the ladder in a variety of environments with the last 8 as a hands on IT manager in a small department, but I have been on both ends.

I used to think about most of my managers 'what do they do all day?'  Until, the job was mine. I ran into one of my old managers at an IT conference in Orlando. I walked up to him and just apologized. He laughed and said "for what?" I admitted to him that I wondered what he did in his office all day. He must have laughed out loud for 2 full minutes. The he said "It's ok, I used to think the same thing about my manager!"

The moral of the story here is that we only know what we know. I am sure your middle managers are catching hell from their managers who are catching hell from upper management. The higher you go up the chain, the less it becomes about the work or product and the more it becomes about profit and productivity. The low end managers get it the worst, because the usually understand the how and why the most, but their bosses just don't care. To them it's better, faster, cheaper. But in their defense, they have to keep a company competitive in the market. 

I know I drive my most technically skilled guy crazy with my pace and requests, but I have to deal with a bigger picture. 

The take away from all of this is don't think your managers are just being like this for its own sake. Understand that they have a whole bunch of different things they have to provide. It may not make your situation any easier, but maybe it will give you some insight I to the madness.  </TEXT>

Start working now in IT, if you don't have certifications or a degree start working on them now as well. It's not one or the other. I started in IT in 1994, but got my bachelor's in 2010 and my MBA last year. Did both of those because I could tell my options were going to be limited if I end up moving on. </TEXT>

I use visible companion affinity to see how much my followers like me. The armorsmith mod adds a new dimension to modding armor including eyewear.

<TEXT> Cards are subjective and everything needs context. There is so much more going on with your question. Do you have a negative self-image? So often people turn to the cards for divination answers to how other people think or feel when it is us who is creating the situation in the first place. Always start with yourself in your readings and post up here for additional insight. The hardest people to read for are ourselves.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> These types of relationship divination spreads always rubbed me the wrong way. This particular one places an interesting amount of  emphasis on appearance which leads me to believe it is popular with teenagers. They key to a quality relationship is having as much self awareness of our motivations and fears as possible. Yet, so many people only want to address the fulfillment of their desires. 

Addressing some of these cards - the 10 of swords is hitting rock bottom and speaks to moving on after. In some ways, I see it as the minor arcana Death card in the same way as the 2 of cups is the minor arcana Lovers. I've always felt these minor majors are on a more personal level and are something we have more control over as opposed to the spiritual forges of the major arcana.

The Devil is more complicated - he is telling you that this relationship ideal that you have created exists and someone is out there that will fulfill it. An unfortunate lie that will have you trying to impose your reality on another person to which the only end is disappointment.  

Why waste your time with a powerful tool trying to divine a future that you will superimpose your own desires? Like so many people, you will get frustrated with the Tarot and feel it doesn't work. Look to it for self discovery and find friends and do readings together.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've got an LCP and wish it had a safety.  I know some people (including my CCW instructor) are against safeties on concealed handguns,  but I just don't trust myself and am much more likely to shoot myself in the butt than be in a situation where not having the safety on is going to matter. (Please understand that I am not saying I'll never need it, just that I am more like to shoot myself in the butt). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The synths raided a building while I was exploring it. They shot the non-aggressive handys, ok, I guess they have their reasons. They left me alone since I've been to the Institute and played nice, but they gunned down a freaking cat! What the hell, man? I haven't played enough through to get their motivations, but I think I've figured out their grand plan, what that has to do with blasting Fluffy is beyond me. Anyone else witness this cat-tastrophie? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kabong is correct, but now in many places there are waiting lists. A local shop here in FL has them for $259, but they're out and dont know when the next ones are coming in.

<TEXT> Congrats! The LCP that's the one I carry. Make sure you take it to the range and put 100+ rounds through it. It's small, and until I got a good grip, I would occasionally hit the mag eject button and it would jam. I can't say it's the most fun to shoot, it's got a hard slide and trigger pull - but that's better because it does not have a safety. Still, for around $250 it's a great deal and it's very small. I like it!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. You should not need to take the CCW course if you are military, but you do need to be 21.  You apply at the tax collectors office - Check the website to see what documentation you will need and to make an appointment. I don't know the requirements compared to a resident,  but you can get a non-resident CCW.
2. I know my FL CCW is valid in (I think) 37 states. It's less for non-resident CCW holders, but Alabama is OK.
3. I like the Ruger LCP as it is a tiny 380 and can be found for around $259-$279, but definitely ask around. </TEXT>
