<TEXT> Just like primitive organisms captured bacteria that served the purposes of mitochondria and then became a part of that organism, the same way it is beleived that amoeba engulfed cyanobacteria and then got incorporated in it instead of getting digested and became an organelle of it and thus the first powerhouse came into existence. Over millions of years chloroplast and mitochondria specialized and cannot live outside their cells. This is known as endosymbiosis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The eyes of fish and other sea creatures evolved to see underwater. Life first originated underwater but without eyes, so the first sea creatures had no vision at all but over time some  evolved to have special proteins or chemicals that were sensitive to light. At first it was just a few patches of light, then some colours, then a blurred vision and then came the eyes that were perfect to see underwater. But when life evolved for terrestrial life and when the first sea creature came on land it didn't have the proper eyes to see the world above water. Light when passes from one medium to another, it bends, this is known as refraction and this happens when light passes from air into water, so the eyes of the first land creatures were made to see underwater. The eyes of fish and terrestrial vertebrates today are almost the same but for one difference, fish have a more spherical lens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think there is much of a difference between them except for the way they are obtained by our body. Both the Vitamin Ds serve the same purpose. There is something called 7-dehydrocolesterol under our skin which when hit by sunlight gets converted into vitamin D.

<TEXT> Babies are like that. They have no idea when to sleep and when to wake up cause they are not aware of the concept of time or day or night. For them the world is just filled with meaningless moving things. Babies aren't engrossed in their sleep as much as us. They have breaks between their sleep. But this doesn't mean that sleep is not crucial for them, sleep is very crucial for developing brains like of babies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The mitochondria is called the powerhouse of the cell because its main function is to generate energy for the cell to function. It does that through a process called cellular respration. This process uses oxygen and many more other components and through a series of reactions it creates ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), it is also known as the currency of energy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Diary of Donna Redd [Part 1] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 17:40:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last week I was returning home from the bar, it was close to my apartment so I usually walked there. I had some chat with my friends while we gulped down some glasses of fizzing alcohol; it was normal, thats what we normally did. But that day we had a couple extra glasses so after I left the bar I was having a hard time keeping myself balanced and my vision was getting blurred out with every step I took. I was tired and I wanted to reach home as soon as possible. I was conscious enough to walk that small distance from the bar to my apartment.

I had to pass a graveyard. It was dark and silent; the cold winds blew with the dust as the moon shone brightly above me. It was awkwardly silent, only my footsteps echoed through the dark street and the hollow sound of winds.  As soon as I came close to the entrance of the graveyard thick grey clouds obscured the moon and it only added to the darkness that hovered all around me. Then, I heard something, something that sent chills down my spine, I heard a girl call out my name.

Daniel 
It was soft, like a whisper on a wind, like a spirit. 

Just my thoughts, its my mind, nothing else I told myself and I kept walking. 

After I took a few more steps, I heard her again, Its me, Daniel, the same spine chilling tone, like a whisper with shades of malice in it, and this time I recognised the voice, it was someone whom I wish I had no memory of. My blood froze with terror and I started walking faster and louder. 

You cant escape, you cant forget about me, this time it was not a whisper, it was louder and scarier, my heart started hammering, her cry had wrath in it and it shook me, that wrath wanted me dead, just like her. 

I started running. 

You cant run away

You cant hide

Your death is at bay

Its going to be a fun ride

She sang. I was panting, I heard footsteps behind me. Oh my god! Is she here? Is she following me?
I looked back and I saw nothing but an empty dark street and as soon as I turned my head back again I saw a still and stiff dark figure in a cloak, I dashed into it and fell down on the cold ground. My head was already spinning because of the drinks and now it was aching, I took a few seconds to come back to my senses and then I stood up and I saw nothing, that dark figure vanished, there were no more whispers. But then when I saw what lay next to my foot on the ground I was taken aback and almost fell down again.

There in front of me on the ground lay the diary of Donna Redd. The very first thought that came to my mind was to abandon the diary and leave the place, but I knew that it was of no use as I had to take the diary with me cause she has come back with her game, the very same game I started five years back, if I lose then I die and the only way to win the game was through the diary, so I had to take it with me.

<TEXT> You say that capture the flag might be unfair because of difference in movement speed and abilities, but don't you think even a normal siege match could sometimes be unfair, for example if the whole team chose all tanks, the match will mostly be won by the tank team unless and untill they all are just noobs. 

What I mean by capture the flag is that it should not necessarily be exactly like that but something similar. They could have some limitations on the hero selection or something like that.

Your idea of conquer the fortress sounds pretty nice. It would be interesting to explore if it were to be made into an actual thing by Hi-Rez. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep. I think they should equally focus on creating new maps as they do for new heroes. As you said that maps are harder to make, this would result in longer intervals between patch releases but it would also give us patches with more content to explore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It has been some time since we have been testing maps and till now we have got only two new maps, Stone keep and Brightmarsh and also that the new maps coming out are only for the Siege matches and so far we have not seen anything new for Payload and Survival. It would be great if we discussed our ideas for some new maps, modes, fixes, heroes, etc.

PvE was great like the invisible drogoz one (that was fun), but wouldn't it be nice if they added something like capture the flag or some more new modes.

Feel free to correct me if you think I was wrong anywhere. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to write enticing scenes? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I would like to start with saying that my native language is not english. But I am really found of writing, especially in english. I practise a lot, read a lot and also try to make some short stories and poems using prompts. 

I find it quite difficult to build scenes or build a character. I was reading The Magician's Nephew and it has a chapter in which Narnia's creation is discussed. That chapter was so impressive, I was totally engrossed in it.

So my question is; how to build scenes which activate almost all the senses of the reader to totally absorb the reader into the book? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Date Night </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-24 20:41:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was excited to meet him. I was going on my first date after moving to this new town. It has been three months since I have moved to this town. I got up early, even before the sun, I love the dark city in the morning and also at night, the silence, and also because I was excited to meet Anthony.

I had bath and my breakfast and was ready to go to my boring same old job.

I was thinking about the date the whole day, about the dress which I specially bought three days back for tonight. I didnt know the answers for the various questions that rose in my mind. But I surely did know it was going to be a fun night.

My shift was over, Danny came to his shift to replace me, and I was happy to leave that place and head back home to get ready for the date. I took the bus, it was filled with all kinds of people and all of them were engrossed in something, books, and phones.

I reached home. I quickly had a bath and wore my red gown. I reached the restaurant where we decided to meet. I saw him, waiting for me with his hands behind him. I saw him and he saw me. My heart stopped for a second, he was beautiful, a really nice smile he had and he also had a really nice figure, an athletes. His hands were thick and muscular, he seemed quite strong and like a person who takes personal fitness seriously. 

I went to him.

He stares at me and is stunned to look at me just like all the other men before who I have met.

I dont know what people think of me or my personality but I was pretty sure that I was a beautiful woman.

You look pretty, beautiful. Anthony said slowly and with a nice smile, with his hands still behind him.

You look handsome too. I said.

After a second of exchanging stares with each other, he pulled out a bouquet which had purple, yellow and red flowers which smelled entrancing. I took it from his hands and my fingers touched the back of his palm. I thanked him for the bouquet and we went in. We took our seats, had a lovely dinner and a talked a lot.

After that, he asked me whether I wanted him to drop me at my house in his car. I didnt refuse.

We reached at my house. I got out of his car and started walking towards the front door of my house. As I went more and more away from the car I felt him pulling me towards him, towards his body. I didnt want to leave him. So I stopped and turned around. He was still there, in his car, looking me go away.

Would you like to come in and have some coffee? I asked Anthony.

Sure, he replied and got out of his car. We went in.

It was surely not for the coffee but what came after it.

He waited for me on the couch as I was preparing coffee for him. I brought him his cup. I wanted to be done with the coffee as soon as possible. I cant wait to take him to my room. I was literally burning from inside.

He took his first sip from the cup and after a few second he started to feel a bit dizzy. I saw him fall unconscious on the ground with the cup. I wasnt surprised, the pills were working. This is what I was waiting for. Finally, the moment was here where I could take him to my room. I dragged his unconscious body to my room and on the way his head hit a few corners. He was heavy, bulky and I liked that because its so much fun cutting open a muscular body. I was sweaty and thirsty after all that dragging, so I went to the kitchen to cleanse my thirst with some water and then to the basement to get my axe which I had bought three days back after I had bought my new dress. A spark of energy bolted within me as I touched the axe, it made me more excited. I returned to my room where Anthony was still lying there with half life on the floor
. 
Smack! I hit the axes blade on his thigh and blood flew on my red dress.

Smack! 

Then his arms. More blood.

Smack!

Then the face. More blood.

With every drop of blood that spurted out of him, I got happier and happier. I dont know why but I loved this. This is what I did to Ian, Sam, Nathan and every other man I have met before. I loved cutting up men. It felt like an art to me.

My daddy used to abuse my mom, beat her. I didnt like it, so one night I drowned him in his own blood. It all started with my dad.

After Anthonys body was in eighteen or so pieces, I decided to end the fun. I got a huge plastic bag to put in the pieces. It was 1 am in the morning. 

I took the bag to my backyard. I dug up a hole with a shovel. I didnt want to bury the pieces while in the bag, if they pieces were buried without the bag and just in the dirt they would decompose faster. I emptied the whole bag with Anthony into the hole and also threw in the axe, just like I did for Jackson, Henry and Mathew. I filled the hole again with mud and back in my house.

I was tired but I did enjoy it a lot. I took a bowl of chips and saw some TV, my hands were still strained in blood but it didnt matter much.

TWO MONTHS LATER

It has been two months since I have moved to this town and I was excited to meet Barry tonight.
