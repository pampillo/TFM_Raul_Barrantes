<TEXT> Here is an article asking if Bush's US attorney purge was unprecedented:

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/so-is-this-us-attorney-purge-unprecedented-or-not/ 

Last night, Fox News' Brit Hume kicked off his show by criticizing the media for "news stories reporting that the Bush administration had considered firing all 93 U.S. attorneys across the country [that] failed to mention that that is exactly what Bill Clinton did soon after taking office back in 1993." 

This argument has been making its way around the conservative echo chamber. Wrote Brent Baker: "The broadcast network evening newscasts, which didn't care in 1993 about the Clinton administration's decision to ask for the resignations of all 93 U.S. attorneys, went apoplectic Tuesday night in leading with the 'controversy,' fed by the media, over the Bush administration for replacing eight U.S. attorneys in late 2006." 

In light of all this, I thought it was important to compare the two cases.

The Washington Post laid it out like this: "Although Bush and President Bill Clinton each dismissed nearly all U.S. attorneys upon taking office, legal experts and former prosecutors say the firing of a large number of prosecutors in the middle of a term appears to be unprecedented and threatens the independence of prosecutors." 

Former acting attorney general Stuart Gerson, meanwhile, wrote that it "is customary for a President to replace U.S. Attorneys at the beginning of a term. Ronald Reagan replaced every sitting U.S. Attorney when he appointed his first Attorney General. President Clinton, acting through me as Acting AG, did the same thing, even with few permanent candidates in mind." (Hat tip on this and the Post piece to TPM.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bahara was part of the bulk resignation action though, he was only fired because he refused to resign. Yates was fired for not acting on the EO, whether or not the EO was unconstitutional. Hind Sight allows for the connection an an investigation to be drawn now. I think it is hard to separate the months of Russia this and collusion that but it is revisionist history to claim yates was fired for any reason beyond refusing to follow through on the President's EO (whether it is constitutional or not), you may think it was not a justified firing but it is the reason she was fired.

I know we are going in circles here but for fun here is another take on the Russia investigation if you are interested.

<TEXT> It wasn't a convenient excuse, she was a hold out from the previous admin who was a placeholder waiting for Sessions. She then refused to act on his EO. Only now that it makes for a nice story are people claiming she was fired for investigating Trump.

He also ask for the resignation of 46 US Attorney's around the country, were they all investigating him?

It's only a distinct trend when you focus on three people. Is there confirmation that Bahara was investigating Trump? Can you link?

<TEXT> Are you claiming he fired Yates and Bharara because they were investigating him? The Yates firing was part of her highly publicized refusal to follow through on an EO and Bharara was part of a mass firing of DA's that was not totally uncommon.

Without context, you're right it looks like he is firing people 'investigating' him but in context it is a totally weak argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So that's what's left to hang on to for the Russian conspiracy theorists. 

Why did the President wait until General Flynns false assurances to the Vice President and others become public before removing him from his post, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is pursuing its own investigation into Trump-Russia ties, said in a statement.

After the Senate Judiciary subcommittees hearing ended, Trump said in one of a series of tweets that Yates had given the media nothing but old news. He went on to say, The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?

Why did he wait? Who knows, but when this is the nitpicking this investigation is coming to then who cares. I am going to agree with the President on this one this is old news, which this media outlet is running with.  </TEXT>

If I got to choose what the situation was I would want to see people having a direct financial relationship with their doctor and insurance for major incidents. Having public corps handle healthcare is not good because their primary responsibility is to Share holders not doctors and not patients. 

For this conversation the power we are giving the government is only supporting insurance corps not people or the HC industry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey sorry for the delayed response...

In the end I thin the Hysteria is over hyped, but I respect your opinion and I am glad we got to have this 'chat'

I wanted to make a point about the Green energy movement and my perspective on it. Focusing specifically on Solar;

I am a big fan of Solar Energy but it has nothing to do with the environment or climate change. I support Solar because it is a huge step towards the democratization of energy. The more we can create energy independence for the homestead, the more liberty we can achieve. I find this argument to be way more persuasive than any moral environmental argument. 

Imagine each American home utilizing it's local resources to generate energy, it is a beautiful thought. 

Well anyway, thanks again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks. You clearly understand the naysaying, probably better than I do. I have a couple of follow up questions. 

What do you think about the ice core data that showed CO2 rise following temperature rise? This is explained by the ocean releasing more and more CO2 as temperatures rise. 

Second, do you think we have the capability to generate enough energy through green energy tech to replace fossil fuels? Is there a projection for when we will? As an aside, how come so many people who advocate the catastrophic climate change theory are against nuclear power?

One counterpoint I want to make is that people can respect and use science and still reject the climate change hysteria. I think this movement to support 'science' as one big idea is getting to close to religion for me. I see way too many people who are just saying 'science' as an excuse or explanation and it is framing tactic to try to imply people who doubt the CC hysteria reject science wholesale and that isn't true. Also implying everyone who does this is in the pocket of big oil is disingenuous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you talk about paying the current cost how do you mean? We see Green energy rocketing into the future wether big oil companies want it to or not. So what cost beyond energy generation should we pay?

As far as large scale societal movement goes, it is traditionally on an individual level but large numbers of individuals are driven to the change. Trying to change things top down often times gets messy and allows for this win power to control the change. Unfortunately if you're right about our future this will only happen when people habitats become inhabitable. 

I am skeptical of the predictions. I have read from both sides and one of the major sticking points I see is the traditional movement of CO2 upwards being to follow temperature movement upwards. There are other common data points like the correlation of sun spots to temperature, which can be mapped similarly to the modern maps we see of CO2 and temperature. Also the declining temperature between 1940 and 1980 while carbon emissions rose significantly, let alone all of the past temperature fluctuation when humans were not emitting CO2 at the scale we currently are. 

I can appreciate the theory and I appreciate you taking the time to lay out your perspective on it but I am currently undecided between it is not happening and if it is, then it is. The world changes and if it changes because of our progress we need to decide which is more important, I am going to side with progress. 

I also believe in human ingenuity so if the sea level rises to a point of major land changes then I couldn't think of a species I'd rather have to deal with it.  </TEXT>

I would personally love to see our tax dollars going to training people on basic office job skills, manual skills like masonry or on soft skills like negotiation...this way if someone wants to make more we are arming them with the appropriate skill set.

Like I said I may not have the answer but mandating pay scales can have some serious negative effects like reduced hours or complete replacement with touch screens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree, increasing the standard deduction could be huge for people who currently cannot take advantage of itemized deduction. 

The 15% corporate tax rate has more nuance. From what I have seen it will include a reduction in loop holes, so some industries will end up paying more than they do now, and others will pay less. Then you need to factor in any growth in the economy with more money swirling in people's hands which will be spent and increase more small business and corporate growth, leading to more tax revenue. 

Comparing the 15% rate to the current rate without nuance it absolutely means our government will bring in less money but these changes do not happen in a vacuum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would argue it is ignorant to label people as climate denier's...what specifically qualifies someone for this label?

Creationist's as following their faith, so I would not call it ignorant...maybe misguided?

Trump looks like a competent President because he is following through on his promises and is also adjusting to the situation at hand when necessary. He has hosted people from all sides of the political spectrum, including those who heavily criticized him. He hasn't been President long enough to categorize him as either a success or a failure. This is always going to be a divisive question because there are people who adamantly despise him, people who adamantly support him, and people in the middle who are not ideologically locked in and will judge his performance on facts rather than feelings.

The biggest problem I see is, so long as people are willing to discount their fellow citizens opinions as ignorant simply because they disagree we will not be able to have a substantive conversation. I find it to be gross when someone tries to cast them selves as better than others because of a different political opinion, like you comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is no possible spin on this- https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-appears-to-mock-disabled-reporter-video

This is a great example of him being taken out of context.

Firstly, the reporter does not move around like that, in any way.

Secondly, he did the same motions to mock non disabled people...during the same speech. Ted Cruz and a General. Go watch the whole thing and see why is this a perfect example of out of context maligning. Anne Coulter wrote up a whole thing about it and if I can find it I will add. 

When viewed outside of the 30 second clip he does in fact mock many people in the same way, then go and watch an interview of the journalist and see how this mocking has nothing to do with the reporter's actual disability.

I check some of the others later in the day.

<TEXT> It could be people are disgusted. I find that 'they' often misrepresent what was said or done. I also think that there was a concerted effort to support HRC during the campaign and maybe Trump's election was a reflection on how little influence some major media companies have in our evolving society. 

There certainly were 'journalists' exposed in Wikileaks that were int he tank for Clinton, and I am sure they are personally pissed about the Trump win.

It also could be people who are in media positions who personally are disgusted with Trump who let their personal opinions infiltrate 'news' reporting. 

I have found people who admit their bias when reporting often give more honest reflections(or their reflections are more easily measured against their bias). Ben Shapiro is a good example; Ben did not support Trump during the election and was very open about it, however when he reacted to something Trump related he gave an honest accounting. His running segment Good Trump/Bad Trump is a great example of this. 

So I am not totally sure, it also could be a ratings thing. Sensationalized reporting probably gets better ratings.


*Side Note: Shapiro recently seems convinced Trump is going to betray conservatives and be a big government President. I recommend his show for everyone no matter their leanings. He often criticizes right leaners by saying they wouldn't support something Trump does if Obama had done it.*

<TEXT> It could never have been the honeymoon with all of the negative press and media we see surrounding Trump. I saw a report, if I can find it I will link, that 89% of the coverage of Trump so far has been negative. 

I mean NYT even tried to make a negative out of the Patriots visit. So I never expected a honeymoon because there are so many journalists who seem personally offended that Trump won. 

But, I see him as doing a good job so far and I would guess that over time more and more people will begin to agree.

<TEXT> ... but the same thing can be said for every world leader, corporation, shoot I would even make the case it is better for the American Citizens. When you hyper focus on Russia and make it all about Putin ignoring the fact that there are so many other people, countries and companies in the world then sure it seems like he is helping Putin. 

If you apply perspective i think there is a very different story. I can be swayed by evidence but the article is citing things that haven't happened but they suspect it will happen. 

Stuff like Tillerson having a good relationship with Putin is good for us, we shouldn't discount Tillerson's years of experience dealing with foreign leaders and negotiating with them just because in that process he developed a positive relationship with Putin. 

So they article is designed to frame things in a way that looks like Russia will be on easy street because of Trump but does little to actually prove it. This is not evidence it is some guys opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Do you accept that Russian intelligence ran an unusual and substantial campaign to influence the election?

I accept that it is totally probable. I would like our government to examine the DNC server, which to my knowledge they have not and have been basing conclusions off of Crowdstrike's analysis. 

As for the internet trolling, I could totally see Russia doing this. Shoot we have American groups doing it. This unfortunately is a big part of the internet and any narrative. Look at this very sub, ShareBlue is a an organization born of Correct the Record who spent the campaign using internet users to push a narrative. If anything we should expect this from foreign governments, political groups, corporations and anyone else with a message they want to push. 

The RT part of the Russian campaign of influence is almost undeniable because it is Russian state television. But what I come back to with this over and over is that often times what was being discussed or pushed was straight from Wikileaks which has been proven to be accurate. So the influence was around factual items from the Clinton team. There may have been fake news pushed by internet trolls, but again that is not exclusive to Russia. 

An example of something I have seen people describe as a Russian narrative which I think is inaccurate is the Clinton health stuff. That was not a Russian narrative, it was people drawing conclusions based on real world events. Her fainting in 2012 and being out of pocket for 6 months, the constant coughing, and the infamous 9/11 fainting. 

I am concerned that Russia influence has become an overarching excuse for things that often times it is not applicable to.


So long story short, i can accept it but I will not accept it as an excuse for Clinton's loss or as something wholly Russian. And, not that you are saying it is, it is not part of the same conversation as Trump /Russian collusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He by no means holds exclusive rights to dishonesty, but I can understand where you are coming from.

It's interesting because I am not surprised by revelations someone like Page spoke to Russians given his past. I also find it interesting that things like Trump meeting the Russian ambassador during the summer being reported without context that there were several ambassadors present. 

I have found much of the Russian narrative to be all story and little substance. I do not think it is wise to have it be considered criminal for people to meet with or speak with Russians, especially when so many people beyond the Trump team do it.

I honestly believe there is nothing there with the Trump/Russia narrative but I am open to changing my mind if anything beyond circumstantial evidence of conversations comes up. Where I find I am most conflicted is when someone like Mukasey (ex Bush AG)says that even if there is an email from Trump to Putin asking him to dig up dirt on Clinton it would not be illegal. So if that evidence surfaces and no charges are brought, it is still a really shitty thing to do. (I do not consider the press conference when Trump said if Russia had it to release the missing emails as this because that quote has been misrepresented for months).

In the end the narrative does not stand up to context, from my view. I can understand why people do not like Trump which you outline your perspective on, but I do not think this investigation will provide you reprieve from that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I could see an instance where the Obama admin wanted to abuse their power to spy on an opponent. There is no evidence proving it so it is just a theory. But if they used the dossier, or used the fact that Page spoke with Russians(which he worked in Russia and it would have been impossible for him not to) to spy on the Trump team there could be political motivation. 

Then you add in all the leaking, which is clearly political, and it starts to make more sense. Again this is just a theory not backed by definitive evidence. Just like the Trump/Russia theory. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You may be right, I need to go back and see what exactly the dossier was claiming about Page...unless you know it offhand. I do know he worked in Russia so finding connections between Page and Russia is not so crazy. I think the question is if he was promising concessions in exchange for something?

At the very least we know know that the FBI did not have evidence beyond what is in the public sphere to justify their FISA request. What I am most interested in is what, if any, evidence exists of any potential collusion that we do not know about? I had previously thought there was something to justify the FISA outside of public knowledge.

I have been leaning on the Clapper interview a lot lately, because it is the highest person who would have knowledge of the investigation, not associated with Trump, and he said there was no evidence of collusion. 

If there was nothing beyond the dossier, it is looking like the spying really could have been politically motivated. </TEXT>

China had said they were not going to accept NK coal, but still were until Xi met with Trump. They then turned the ships back and ordered more American coal. 

China is now going to be accepting US Beef imports which have been banned for 13 years.

China is taking a hard stance with NK based on our President's request.

So why would he go and insult them, now that we are getting concessions? I know many users in this sub never saw an insult they didn't like, but this is a good thing and demonstrates the strength of our President's diplomacy.

Why are you being so dismissive of Clapper, why would he not know? I am not making up that he was the DNI, and as to why he would know what was being collected on the Trump team here is a list of the DNI's responsibilities:

Serve as head of the sixteen-member United States Intelligence Community,
Direct and oversee the National Intelligence Program; and
Serve as an advisor, upon invitation, to the President and his executive offices of the National Security Council, and the Homeland Security Council about intelligence matters related to national security;
On July 30, 2008, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13470,[1] amending Executive Order 12333 to strengthen the DNI's role.[2] Further, by Presidential Policy Directive 19 signed by Barack Obama in October 2012, the DNI was given overall responsibility for Intelligence Community whistleblowing and source protection.

<TEXT> My big three were no more interventionist wars (we will see about this with Syria)

Plans for creating opportunity for our inner cities was a big one (Trump 
campaigned a lot on this but I feel like it got missed in all the faux racist hype) I think we, as Americans, should all make it a national priority to help people who need our help within our own borders.

Not being part of our shitty political system, very important. I am not an R or a D and I am sick of their partisan bought and paid for by special interest BS.

Focus on America First, which the inner cities plans were presented as a big part of, was a big deal for me.

I wrote an in depth thing right around the election but the above three were big ones for me. I voted Bernie in the primary because I wanted a Trump/Bernie general. I believed both honestly wanted what was best for the country.

I have to say when Trump said Our country will no longer submit to the false song of globalism I was very happy. 

That's without even getting into how HRC was the human embodiment of our shitty political culture.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> On NATO:
I said it was obsolete. It is no longer obsolete, Trump added.

He has progressively come around to supporting NATO after it increased efforts to allow more U.S. and European intelligence sharing on terrorism.

Trump, however, has remained firm on NATO allies meeting their financial obligations and pay what they owe. Trump said he told Stoltenberg that allies need to put 2 percent of their gross domestic products into defense by 2024.

So he is working to improve NATO based on his criticisms...this is a good thing.

Let's check another 'flip flop'..

Export Improt Bank:
It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies, Trump said. Instinctively, you would say, Isnt that a ridiculous thing, but actually, its a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money.

He changed his opinion based on exposure to more facts, this is a good thing...

<TEXT> I don't think there is direct correlation to Hitler betraying Stalin, but damn that is something that is so interesting with historical context. Hitler hate hate hated the soviet union. 

My whole thing with the Russian narrative is that it is completely story driven and none of the connections between Trump people and Russia are all that strange with out having the narrative explained. I am not surprised that business people dealt with Russia, Page worked in Russia so having Russian connections is not that wild. 

The Russian Ambassador being at the RNC convention this summer isn't so crazy considering there were other ambassadors there. Shit the Russian ambassador sat with the Democrats during Trump's join address earlier this year. 

The strongest component of the whole theory is the narrative, which when presented a certain way makes Trump people's connections to Russia look nefarious...when they previously were not. 

If we are going to set a standard that working with Russian people, or talking to Russian people is not ok then we need to expand the scope of investigations way beyond the Trump camp. This is why the evidence the Podesta Group was taking payments from Russia is important, because it provides context to the extent that powerful Americans work with Russians. 

So i do think the Russian narrative is largely media driven, because the story is the most compelling part and it allows for fan fiction on places like this sub to crop up because the story is not evidence driven.

Now that we know the FBI has a FISA warrant for Page since the summer, when we see someone like former DNI Clapper say he saw no evidence even more damning for the narrative. It means he had access to any potential evidence from the summer through January and he saw no evidence...

Schiff also said there was no definitive evidence of Trump/Russian collusion more recently.

I am not saying don't investigate, especially since the investigations only seem to lead to the conclusion that the Trump camp did not actually collude with Russia. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so this guy has some points defending his position and acknowledging that CO2 is not a main driver of climate change. I am not clear what he meant, he is saying a chart doesn't prove it but the reference is about acknowledging the ice core samples show temperature is not driven by CO2.

I am not sure how he can retort the atmospheric temperature not heating faster when the guy doing the measurements is in the doc I posted. Which apparently there are many versions of, which I did not realize. 

Full quote. I'm going to check this guys theory out. 

The IPCC was one of the main targets of the documentary. In response to the programme's broadcast, John T. Houghton (co-chair IPCC Scientific Assessment working group 19882002) assessed some of its main assertions and conclusions. According to Houghton the programme was "a mixture of truth, half truth and falsehood put together with the sole purpose of discrediting the science of global warming," which he noted had been endorsed by the scientific community, including the Academies of Science of the major industrialised countries and China, India and Brazil. Houghton rejected claims that observed changes in global average temperature are within the range of natural climate variability or that solar influences are the main driver; that the troposphere is warming less than the surface; that volcanic eruptions emit more carbon dioxide than fossil fuel burning; that climate models are too complex and uncertain to provide useful projections of climate change; and that IPCC processes were biased. Houghton acknowledges that ice core samples show CO2 driven by temperature, but then writes that the programme's assertion that "this correlation has been presented as the main evidence for global warming by the IPCC [is] NOT TRUE. For instance, I often show that diagram in my lectures on climate change but always make the point that it gives no proof of global warming due to increased carbon dioxide."[23]


Here is an article by Sir John in 2004 about how we're not doing enough for global warming, which is caused by CO2 emissions.

When clicking the word evidence you are not taken to evidence of the video being wrong you are linked to a definition page for the word evidence. It also says the literature of the period... and literature is linked, guess where it goes. 

The second rebuttal is even better because it provides links to evidence the movie is misrepresenting data, it's just that the links don't work, which the author acknowledges and says to google it.

<TEXT> I can appreciate your point of view. I totally disagree but I am OK with that. Just trying your shoes on for a moment, I think the biggest hurdle to jump is that because the climate change is constant and slow people grow accustomed to it. So the messaging of immediacy is lost when people are not noticing incremental change. So if we want people to change their ways it has to effect their daily life immediately, like an invasion would. How can you effect change in that way?

<TEXT>  Obviously our worldviews are incompatible but hopefully you can see where I'm coming from.

This is my favorite part of honest discussion, disagreements can be fun, engaging and educational. 

I would argue rethinking our economic system is not pragmatic. From my perspective, providing incentives to people's selfish nature is the best way to effect change. That does not mean I do not support spending federal dollars on research, I do. I also support private citizens who are incentivized to fund research for their own personal benefit...which also happens to benefit the rest of us.

I think progress is always built on past progress, or change if built on past change...which is much more appropriately defined as growth. Sometimes growth is hard to predict and often comes from the actions of a small group of self interested individuals. 

Like I was saying earlier, I am not against the development and research of green energy solutions, but I see it is being a democratic and empowering change for individuals...not a climate argument.

<TEXT> With the storms and rainfall, would you say the climate is becoming more unpredictable?


I think the food point is a good one, sorry for ignoring it initially I should give more time to the reasonable people than the ones who have nothing but insults. 


Food availability will become important because of our rising population, and potentially because of a changing climate. I do think this research should be given importance, I believe Bill Gates new group has said something similar to what you are saying and they are putting importance on it.


I would like to see a democratization of food availability, so that we can have solutions for people in countries that are already starving. Many of these people are also the ones hurt by trying to curb fossil fuels. I would add the case for green energy is super strong when it is described as a democratization of power...rather than the moral climate argument.

<TEXT> When you are designing your sewer, can you predict with accuracy the outcomes of your sewer? I know nothing about this, what are typical outcomes and how accurately can you predict them? I would imagine you can pretty tightly control where the sewer output would be? Do you use formula's developed from observation that allow for accurate measurements and builds? 

Has there been a climate model yet that can accurately predict what the temperature will be? Then what temperature, are we talking ocean temperatures? Surface temps? Atmospheric temps? If it is settled then surely we have a great accuracy with our predictions? How much does me running my car for an hour contribute to temperature rises? whats the formula for that? 

Why do ice core samples show that CO2 levels follow temperate level rises, and why would that reverse? I think there are a lot of suitable questions around human caused climate change.

<TEXT> I cannot claim the evidence in this below video as my own, but scientists discussing the evidence is below. 

 There isn't a single thing that I design on a daily basis that is based off science that is 100% agreed on yet my designs work because overwhelming evidence says it is an accurate description of physical phenomena and it is incumbent on anyone who disagrees with the evidence to provide evidence of there own that can be reproduced and mathematically expressed.

I am sure you are building awesome stuff based off of scientific evidence, but is that evidence ever presented simply by saying 'science' and you accept that? Because that is what articles like this one are doing, and as the conversation has evolved it has evolved into accusations of denying 'science'...which means it is no longer a conversation. Simply saying 'science' is equivalent to saying nothing in this sense because we are just expected to believe because, well, 'science'. 

The truth is, if we asked scientists to change our climate within ten years to a specific degree...they couldn't. There is much more evidence that sun spots are closely correlated to global temperature than there is that CO2 is. 

If you're interested here are scientists discussing the man made global warming theory.

<TEXT> I am not anti science, this post was not an argument against the science at all. I am saying that people who speak in generalities of 'science' sound dumb to me and that I do not take them seriously. Just leaning on the word science is about as weak of an argument as I can find. Often time I see a moral argument then accompanying the 'Science' argument which I think is indicative of what the human caused climate change movement has become...a moral movement leaning on 'science'. 

I have been researching it a lot lately. The more i research the more I find non scientists arguing for climate change as a human result. If you are interested below is a link to some seriously credentialed scientists discuss the human caused climate change premise. I do not expect to change your mind but hopefully this doc can share perspective of why maybe we should question the 'consensus' of 'science' on the human caused climate change premise.

<TEXT> Nearly all scientists who study this say that climate change is man made and most nations have entered into treaties over it because it is verified and accepted by the scientific community.

The closest thing we have as a list to represent nearly all scientists is the IPCC report from the UN i believe, I could be wrong, but that includes scientists who do not agree with the reports findings. My original points stands when people make general claims about 'Science' or 'nearly all scientists' it is equivalent to saying nothing.  </TEXT>

What is this?

Anyway I do not have an agenda beyond being sick of people saying 'Science' and expecting it to mean something. The more i research Humanities role in Climate Change the less I trust we have as significant a one as people who say 'Science' as a defense claim.

Just another way of approaching your 'agenda' claims, so what? I am a person using this internet forum just like you should I not express my opinion? What the fuck does my 'agenda' matter... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find it hard to take someone seriously when they argue that doubting the climate change hysteria is anti science. Be weary when people use such vague language, because it is a way to not actually say anything at all. There are plenty of scientists who doubt Mankind's role in the earth's recent warming, but do not doubt that there is warming going on. There are scientists who make the case that CO2 levels actually follow temperature levels, rather than precede them like many climate scientists argue. 


By trying to make it a science or anti-science argument the actual conversations around specifics cannot happen. Add on to that that Pruit is saying the EPA should not have the power to enact new regulations without congressional oversight(which I am oversimplifying) but it isn't an argument about 'science' from what I understand.

<TEXT> For the political purpose question, my answer will be different depending on the time frame. If they spied throughout the campaign, even before the DNC leaks I would say they were looking for dirt. I mean who knows, but knowledge is power and intimate knowledge of a competitor is extremely powerful.

Your kidnapping example doesn't fit the situation because there is evidence they were unmasking, we do not know all the details yet but there have been reports that it had nothing to do with Russia. So we have reports they spied, we have a few different reports on the time frame and the contents. So we really need to learn more to know the extent of the Political or National Security reasons.

<TEXT> Yeah, and that is where I see it for the current situation. We need to find out how and why the information was used and we get conflicting reports on this. It could be, no they(Trump team) were doing something wrong and we needed to know what that was or they were not doing something wrong and we wanted dirt. 

I also would like to know the time frame of the 'spying' (qoutes since we don't agree on if it was or not). Was it 3 months, 6 months, a year? This will be important context for whether it was appropriate or not. 

I just hope we get truth, rather than partisan talking points.

Spying: work for a government or other organization by secretly collecting information about enemies or competitors.

I did not make a quality assessment, just pointing out they did spy. So saying they didn't spy is erroneous from my perspective. I mean technically our government is spying on all of us, which I do think is wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> revealing the name of transition officials who were caught up in legal wiretaps of foreigners is not the same thing as illegally spying on the Trump campaign. But that has not stopped the Susan Rice story from becoming the dominant story on the American right.

The argument seems to be if it was illegal or legal, not that they spied. Even Vox is making the legal/illegal distinction but not questions whether or not they spied.

<TEXT> The maternity leave example is a good one. I, the father, could have taken 4 months off paid if I was the primary parent staying home. My wife got 2 weeks paid, her saved vacation time and then took the remainder of 3 months off unpaid. I chose not to take the time because I wanted to be at work and saw some opportunities coming I did not want to miss out on. 

We both agreed we were better off, or the child was better off, with my wife staying home even if it meant less income.

I know this is a very specific example but it speaks to the point you are making and the decisions families make that effect the overall income of the woman, my wife in this example. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for sharing that. Nicely organized and clearly presented. I have to ask, what's the end game? I am frankly not surprised that a bunch of super rich people have connections to Russia. Is the idea that Trump will somehow be in service to Russia? I mean business people doing business is Russia should not be surprising.

So no we draw a web of connection between all these people dating back pretty far in some instances;

 gt;8/10/2016 - "Howard has major investments in Russia," Trump told Russian politician Alexander Ivanovich Lebed after his trip to Moscow with Lorber, according to a 1997 profile of Trump in the New Yorker. See, they dont know you, Trump told Lorber. With all that investment, they dont know you. Trump they know. Source

To what end? If the end goal is accusing him of treason, which you will need some hard evidence for. 

Schiff has said there is no definitive evidence yet. I would say now that we are learning Trump has been unmasked for some time, I would think there would be definitive evidence? He also says in the below linked article that we shouldn't be jumping to conclusions...

With that being said, in the Wiki when referencing what people have said about the Trump/Russia meme there was no reference to former high ranked US officials saying they saw no evidence connecting Trump to Russia. Linked below. 

I know that with every connection seen it looks more and more definitive that Trump is so deeply tied to Russia, but I honestly think your looking at the trees. If you are going to make a definitive Wiki maybe some context would help, like showing what other major US political figures have connections to Russia...this will help to demonstrate that it is more common than perceived and not just look like Trump people are the only Americans who talk to Russians. 

Also, for context, when the Wiki references the Russian Ambassador personally meeting with Trump it leaves out that there were 3 other ambassadors there. So Trump met with 4 foreign ambassadors. And if you want to know what this obviously nefarious Ambassador looks like he is the fat bald Russian guy sitting with the Dems during The Presidents joint address to Congress this year. Source for Trump meeting with 4 Ambassadors is linked below. 

I am worried that hate for Trump is manifesting in this conspiracy theory and hope that it means he will be impeached. However, George Bush's former AG thinks that Trump could have emailed Putin asking for dirt on Hillary and that would not even be illegal. Linked below. 

I hope Congress can complete their investigations into Russian meddling so we can all move on together. I think part of that should require that the FBI actually analyze the DNC server, so that they can be an official source of blame for Russia and we aren't basing this off of Crowd Strikes analysis.

Either way thanks again for sharing and hopefully we can all move forward onto new ground together.

He also raised questions about the dossier written by a former British intelligence officer, which alleged a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.

When you ignore that there were already high ranking Dems working to serve Russian interests, then you can paint a picture that the President is some sort of Russian stooge. So context allows for a broader view of the situation which puts a big thorn in the side of the Trump/Russia conspiracy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 1985, sixty black-owned banks were providing financial services to their communities; today, just twenty-three remain. In eleven states that headquartered black-owned banks in 1994, not a single one is still in business. Of the fifty black-owned insurance companies that operated during the 1980s, today just two remain.

This article makes some really good points. The main issue seems to be that conglomerates are growing and 'small' business is shrinking. I also think for the Black owned business problem we need to make sure that investment funds are available for Black entrepreneurs.  

This is actually something that Trump has addressed during the campaign so let's see how he follows through on this promise. </TEXT>

We can encourage more economic development in these areas and provide on the job training for those who need jobs immediately. Then people from these neighborhoods can choose to stay and participate in the maintenance, continued development or new business or they can follow the infrastructure outward from the inner city and help train/build new projects.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  nonbelievers

That's the biggest chink in the climate change messaging, it has become a belief structure. My biggest problem with the arguments for human caused climate change as a majority negative thing is that much of the arguments are based off of modeling, which is continually adjusted. 

The best corollary I have heard is related to ulcers. Everyone was in agreement that ulcers were caused by stomach acid, this was a widely accepted explanation. Two guys hypothesized that ulcers were actually caused by a particular bacteria and when no one believed them one of the scientists took the bacteria and developed ulcers.

I am skeptical of any scientist or person claiming to have respect for science that chastises scientists for skepticism. There are a ton of testimonies and talks given by scientists who are skeptical of the human caused and catastrophic predictions by the people pushing the current Climate Change message. 

It is a problem when someone has a questions that that person is put out and called a denier.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  please do comment back once you look into that story. to do otherwise implies you're not here for fruitful discussion but just looking to confirm your world view.

Oh man, you are preemptively attributing motive? 

I read a  WaPo article:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sought-to-block-sally-yates-from-testifying-to-congress-on-russia/2017/03/28/82b73e18-13b4-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html?utm_term=.b6d5b4542402

So they tried to use executive privilege, which is not unheard of. They also tried to use attorney client privileged? 

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/when-presidents-invoke-executive-privilege/

looking through the history of executive privilege(above article), it is typically used to protect the person who would be testifying...which in this case wouldn't matter because Yates presumably wants to testify which explains the attorney client privilege move. 

So it was a power play that looks like it blew up on them. This certainly adds some intrigue to her testimony. 

My biggest problem with the whole Russia story line is so much of it is conjecture right now, we need to get to the facts and move on in a direction depending on the facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Originally I was defending the point of the article. But personally I think the bigger picture is the method and execution because we should understand it and learn from it, like you are saying. 

I don't see the wrong doing with the Trump aspect, what do you think they did wrong or criminal I guess is more accurate. 

I do not think the administration has handled the constant reporting well, if I had to guess I would say they didn't take it seriously at first. My guesses aside I would like the house to quite the drama and just get to the bottom of their investigation into both Russian method and execution and any Possible Trump admin wrong doing so we can move on. 

The first step would be to have an actual governmental organization examine the DNC server so we aren't resting all accusations on Crowdstrikes' analysis. 

I also find it odd that the Russians were paying healthy sums to the Podesta group to do their lobbying, which was closely associated with Trumps opponent, but then they undermined her campaign and collided with Trump? It's weird. 

Either way let's investigate it all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This could have been a really great article if they didn't try to attribute some malicious attack on green energy. 

But the entire goal of Trumps panoply of executive orders  enabling more oil and gas development and weakening regulations on carbon emissions  is to prioritize dirty domestic energy sources (oil and coal) over clean domestic energy sources (natural gas, wind and solar).

Reducing regulations for 'dirty' energy sources is not a war on green energy. The article points out how green energy is on the rise and companies are making long term strategies around it. It also makes a point that an 8 year span of a President who isn't actively promoting green energy isn't enough to slow the growth of the industry. 

If they left the manufactured intent out then we see a picture of a shifting industry, which has little to do with Trump. 

I think the best case for solar is not an environmental one but a democratization of energy. What's says liberty like a self sufficient piece of private property powered by the sun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well they hired Podesta's brothers firm so they were pretty close.

I see two big holes in the Russia/Trump narrative. 
First off they already hired the Podesta's to represent their interests. This is an actual exchange of money, to represent their interests....

Secondly, noone has investigated the DNC server besides crowdstrike, wtf? If we are going to be accusing people of treason shouldn't the authorities actually investigate the initial breach? If you look over the intelligence reports it is all; it looks like Russia, they used tools like Russia, Putin hates HRC....but they haven't even looked at the server. 

If there is an honest invesitgation the first thing should be to confirm it was actually Russia...you know besides what it seems like.

Podesta lobbying for Russia

<TEXT> No I am basing it off of all of the reporting at the time, which was around how the Trump campaign was in over their head and needed an insider to do their Delegate math and ensure success at the convention. 

As far as trying to find reasons it didn't happen, that is impossible. I do not want to try to prove the negative, but rather want to examine the evidence available. Then after looking at the evidence discuss the possible holes in the conspiracy, or how the evidence strengthens the conspiracy. 

I am currently in the camp that there is a lot of smoke and no fire. So I wanted to sort through the smoke, in the politics sub with other interested people.

Unfortunately it turns into an attack on my motives over a discussion. The Stone stuff actually gives us a chance to discuss this one piece of the puzzle without using platitudes or assumed conclusions....I thought.

Manafort is obviously someone with shady business with Russia and Ukraine, that does not automatically mean Trump does as well and by establishing the nature of his work with the campaign I think I can put that position on solid ground.  </TEXT>

I think implying that Trump colluded with the Russians is counterproductive, especially when there are so many leaps of faith to get to the conclusion. I support and investigation so we can move on and if I end up being wrong it is something I want to know I am wrong about.

<TEXT> I guess, Manafort definitely has some business with Russia that makes him look like a scumbag. But if we look back at when Manafort was brought on, he was the second campaign manager, it was all about his familiarity with the delegate process. 

During the campaign leading up to the convention there was so much delegate math going on and reporting about Trump pulling in an insider from previous Republican campaigns to help seal the delegate deal. He was not involved with the campaign before that, from what we see and was let go after the convention. 

I am not denying that Manafort did some shady shit in Ukraine, he did. But trying to make it seem like he was involved in some big conspiracy with the campaign is a stretch if we actually reflect on the role he played.

Either way I agree all this stuff should be investigated so we can move on because there are enough people who are suspicious it is getting in the way of progress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2) If Wikileaks did not know that Russia was providing the Podesta stuff and Stone spoke with Wikileaks then it does matter...how could it be collusion with Russia if they didn't know Russia was involved?

Also how could it be collusion of the Trump camp if they weren't even working with or talking to Stone? We are piling up degrees of separation here.

3) it matters because this is being used as part of the evidence. I think we know enough now about Stone and his involvement to stop referencing it as any sort of evidence. So let's move on to the next theory and find out more facts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Needing more information is true across the board. But at some point if actual information connecting Trump to Russia fails to materialize we will need to move on. As to Number 2:

SCHIFF: This is a question I think you can answer. Do you know whether the Russian intelligence service has dealt directly with WikiLeaks or whether they too used an intermediary?

COMEY: We assessed they used some kind of cutout. They didn't deal directly with WikiLeaks. In contrast to D.C. Leaks and Guccifer 2.0.

So they used a 'cut out', wikileaks may not have even known it was coming from Russia. Especially since Podesta fell for a phishing scam most likely.

As to Stone being a Trump associate, or part of the Trump cadre, it has been reported and addressed by Spicer that Stone actually has very limited contact with Trump. His interview with Stephanopoulos yesterday shed a lot of light on how little is actually there down the Roger Stone road as far as the Trump/Russia narrative goes. </TEXT>

I have a question though for everyone who thinks Trump colluded with the Russians; Does Stone having communications with Assange's people mean he colluded with the Russians? By Comey's own testimony we know that Wikileaks did not work directly with the Russians.

Also is Stone communicating with Guccifer 2 long after the leaks actually came out evidence of Russian collusion?  </TEXT>

If it were a criminal trial hopefully the FBI or other qualified agency would do their own analysis of the evidence.

I don't know where the disconnect is, I guess I am assuming you are not in the intelligence community and do not have direct access to any evidence, so if you are then yeah you could be forming an opinion based on pure fact.

I feel the need to point out how silly it is to go to such lengths to discredit my opinion, even to the extent where you assume what my opinion is based on from a reply where someone said only right wingers think something and i provided evidence that non right wingers are saying the same thing.

I don't have a good response yet because the article doesn't really provide examples, not that their wrong, but I am going to go deeper into this rabbit hole. I am sure it will be next to impossible to prove some sort of centralized effort to push social media posts, unless they were sloppy or we get a leak. 

I would be foolish to rule this out though, because we know there were American groups like Correct the Record doing the same thing.

<TEXT> This is an interesting article which does a good job of position Trump's proposals with counterpoints to those proposals. I think some of the criticism is nit picking, but that's just me. 

One criticism that I think is just plain wrong;

In his plan, Trump also calls for financial reforms to expand credit and support new job creation, including making it easier for African-Americans to get credit to start businesses. 

"Credit is debt," said Starsky. "The community is talking about building assets, you're talking about building more debt. Who benefits when you offer more credit? The banks. We've seen that story before," said Starsky, referring to the housing boom when blacks and Latinos were the prime targets of subprime loans. 

If we want to push more Black owned businesses they need funding. While Credit is debt, to start a business it is often required and ensuring that Black entrepreneurs have access to credit is critical. 

What I like about Trump's proposals in his New Deal for Black America is that it is all about creating opportunity. He spoke at length about growing the Black middle class and ensuring opportunity for inner cities. 

One criticism I am not sure i followed was;

Trump also called for a "tax holiday for inner city investment," which Melina Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles and an organizer for the Los Angeles Black Lives Matter chapter, called "code for gentrification." She said such tax holidays allow investors to build amenities that typically attract mostly wealthier, white residents, thereby pushing poorer, working class people of color further away from city centers. 

I think the idea behind the incentives would be to create more jobs in the inner cities, but the criticism seems to say that it will only increase the cost of living in those areas? Anyone with more depth of knowledge about 'gentrification' that can school me about this? Do you think tax incentives for inner city investment will hurt the inner city residents?

All in all this is one of the best things I think Trump proposed during the campaign, he honestly seems to want to help grow the Black middle class in America and to help create opportunity for poor inner city inhabitants. I personally think this should be a chief priority for the country, anyone else?

<TEXT> The opening paragraph

The White House tweeted Monday that the directors of the FBI and the National Security Agency told Congress Russia did not influence the 2016 presidential election. But to borrow a phrase from the administrations own parlance, thats actually fake news.


The tweet linked

https://twitter.com/potus/status/843865267008655360

The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process. 


The article does not address the actual words of the tweet. This may not be malicious but it should have been caught in editing I would think. The tweet talks about the electoral process and links a video of the questions from Nunes about vote tampering. 

Trump may have 'misrepresented' the exchange, I don't think so although I understand the criticism, but if that's the case this article falls under the same criticism for misrepresenting the tweet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is an interesting article about his conflicts of interests. I believe he pledged to give foreign money from his hotels to the treasury? I agree there can be potential for a conflict of interest, which is bad. The article does point out though that legally he is not required to divest from his business interests. It is a sticky widget no doubt, and while it is unique in the specifics to Trump, conflict of interest is not an issue Trump alone faces. So when we compare him to establishment Dems we see conflict of interest pop up especially with his former competitor, the establishment Dem Hillary Clinton.

For my point about trusting him more than establishment Dems, I stand by my position. 

Trump's twitter is an incredible openness that we can see on full display, whether he is right or wrong. And i appreciate that openness, i also do not expect someone to be right all the time.

We can disagree, that's fine with me. I like disagreements and think they are healthy in political discussion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What corruption has occurred in the last 60 days? 

I am not going to defend Trump University, there is no point in trying. I don't think total blame lays with Trump for it, but man putting his name on it was a bad move no doubt.

I think he said he would release the returns when the audit is up? Either way I don't care about his returns, although I was shocked at how much he paid in 2005...I was expecting 0 not 38 million.

Still, despite Trump U, he is more trustworthy than establishment Dems. Establishment Dems is actually too vauge maybe? Ron Wyden is a good rep and I respect him. 

I like transparency from all our elected officials for sure, Trump included. I think he is unpresidently open about what he thinks, and maybe that gets him in trouble because he is immediately called a liar. I personally like that we have a President whose public statements and appearances are not some manufactured event. I am loving the twitter Presidency.

As an aside, can we all just agree to use unpresidented from now on without having someone correct the spelling? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No not really. If i have any bias it is against politicians who have been lying to the American people for decades and enriching themselves int he process. I will bring another comment I made over here:

Well that's only half the argument, we have decades of lies and misrepresentation from establishment Dems. I am not arguing Trump is perfect, no human is, but I will stand by my argument that he is more trustworthy than the likes of a Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid.
Harry Reid literally bought land on a river and then supported a project to build a bridge on the land he owns. He also sold all of his Exxon(?) stock before passing regulatory legislation that would cause their stock to drop.
There just isn't enough data on Trump to even compare to the dishonest Democrat establishment. The question was about Dems, but I would make very similar arguments for establishment Republicans too.

Anyone know if church participation is up or down?

Edit:

Church attendance in advanced industrial societies is in gradual general decline with people shifting from weekly to monthly or holiday attendance. Sociologists have attributed this trend to a number of reasons, starting from a simple boredom during services and lack of motivation, to generational incompatibility of belief systems and social changes attributed to modernity.[62] Research across 65 different nations showed that out of 20 advanced industrial countries - 16 demonstrated a declining rate of monthly church attendance.[63]

<TEXT> The Afghan ambassador recently said; 

The Obama administration was the most academic administration we have ever had to deal with but the Trump administration has been the most thoughtful and intelligent.

It is in line with what you are saying about the Obama appointee for DoE. I am not saying Rick Perry is thoughtful and intelligent, but I have seen quite a bit of evidence that Trump is and some people around him, like Mattis are. 

I often think the difference is priorities between Trump supporters and other people, so if you are trying to convince them with something like climate change it won't work because it is not important to them. I realized this when a friend was trying to 'convince' me of how wrong I am. 

Full quote and link to article for context;

http://ijr.com/2017/03/822619-i-had-dinner-with-the-afghanistan-ambassador-what-he-said-about-the-differences-between-trump-obama-is-stunning/

"I've personally met with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the president has had two phone conversations with President Ghani [The president of Afghanistan]. One call was after he won the election and one after [Trump] became president. Before the calls, we were advised to keep conversations short because, we were told, Trump will not be interested in the details of the call and does not have a long attention span, so it would be pointless to have a long call.

However, we were pleasantly surprised at how much time President Trump spent asking very informed questions. The first time the presidents spoke, the questions Trump asked impressed us. How can you win in this fight [against terrorism]? he asked. What do you need to become financially independent? and How can American business invest in Afghanistan? How can we develop businesses and mining in your country?

Trump would listen intently after each question, often asking follow-ups. Trump's second call with our president was even longer than the first. Asking these types of questions for our country is something the Obama administration never did. The Obama administration was the most academic administration we have ever had to deal with but the Trump administration has been the most thoughtful and intelligent.

Trump continually asked How can you win? What does Afghanistan need to win? in reference to our fight with terrorism. Trump wants to win. Sincerely. All the Obama administration wanted to do was not lose.

The Obama administration was hesitant with us. The enemy could sense that. When the Obama administration announced its plans to pull troops out of the region, they announced the exact date they would do it. All our enemies had to do was wait [Obama] out. They knew the date they had to hang on until  which gave them the will to fight. They used that time to recruit and build up resources.

To bring real reform, we must be able to defeat enemies outside our country and inside. We must overthrow the Afghan warlords who are profiteering off the war. Every time we tried to remove one of them from power, [Secretary John] Kerry would say "no" because it would potentially make it unstable and require more troops be brought in. The entire Obama administration was too cautious, but Kerry was the most cautious. Perhaps the Obama administration was fatigued by the time we assumed power. [President Ghani assumed power in September of 2014.] But Trump is very different from Obama in this way.

This is good, for the future of Afghanistan." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 2016 presidential elections illuminated how polarized America has become and how independent and outsider candidates are becoming increasingly appealing to voters. The resulting Trump presidency and the response from both political parties to continue with the same failed status quo approach is broadening political polarization throughout the country and disconnecting the political establishment from its constituents.

I would argue it is what the 'outsider' candidates were promising that was the appeal. The article does a good job of pointing out what the parties are doing wrong, but I think as voters we should focus on what the outsiders were doing right. We need to encourage the behavior of Bernie or Trump, depending on your personal views, no matter their party.

We are not tied to the Democrats or Republicans. We should be thankful people like Bernie or Trump used the Democrat/Republican system to get attention, but it is sad that they have to.

Both parties are corporations and their products are politicians and political action. We are not their primary customer anymore. They own the voting systems, they get all of the media attention and they provide very little to the people for it. 

I have said it before and will say it again, Fuck the Democrats and Fuck the Republicans.

Do your part to MAGA and stop supporting 'establishment' Republicans and Democrats, they do not support you. </TEXT>

Accosting them in public is not enough. These people forgot their rights by disagreeing with us. 

Then we can get all the conservative literature and thinkers and get them too. 

It's justified because we disagree politically.

<TEXT> For your first question, yes. We should do more research...or maybe I need to. One thing I would love to do would be to compare the raw data from NOAA and NASA to their adjusted data. Currently they release adjusted data which has a number of reasons for adjustment.

I also need to look more into the water vapor question because I have seen a scientist present data that it is not rising and data that it is. Water vapor appears to be tied to temperature so I could see it going up and down. Since water vapor is a much more contributing factor to warming than CO2 this is an important question. 

As to what is more important I would say first and foremost would be improving the opportunities for inner city families. This is school opportunity, work opportunity and community safety.

Another problem would be ending regime change policy. I think if we really want to be concerned with the earth we need to stop bombing the shit out of it. I am all for helping people, but you know actually helping them not just killing their dictators or bombing them.

I know these problems are not mutually exclusive but the above two are way more important than climate change in my opinion.

Returning to the helping people over seas idea, one of the big arguments against a global effort to tax carbon or cut CO2 emissions is that there are people in developing countries with out much option. They have not gone through as significant of an industrial revolution as us and we should not be limiting their growth.  </TEXT>

It is an interesting look at the income divide, declining respect for education for educations sake and general cultural decline. He has prescriptions for preserving culture but I haven't gotten their yet. 

It is interesting but written before the internet really became what it is today, which I would posit is it's own major cultural development. 

So that's me. Anyone else? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a good point, the standard may not be high to everyone. But if you are a christian and one of your standards is the school is christian then it fits the mold. 

So you're right. For everyone a private school may not be meeting a high standard. There have been plenty of charter schools who do not meet a standard I consider to be high. so when selecting a private school individuals are using any number of standards to make their decision.

<TEXT> To put some perspective on it;
A couple making 100,000 a year with 2 children is paying probably close to 20% of their pre-tax income on childcare if both parents work full time. 

A couple making 80,000 a year both working full time is probably paying closer to 25% of pre-tax income. 

Childcare is incredibly expensive, and people making the above amounts are most likely not able to get State or Federal assistance so they are paying more per child, at least in my state, than people making less than the outlined. 

It is shitty for everyone because childcare is very expensive but acting like couples maing 100,000 are high eanrers is not very accurate and they carry a heavy cost for childcare. </TEXT>

But, and this is a big but, this is a real opportunity for change. We have an atypical President who doesn't own any of this, he is a new comer and has pledged drastic change in many areas. This is an area that obviously desperately needs change.

It's no secret that the President has not been fond of the CIA and man as Americans we have a real opportunity here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have never said it shouldn't be investigated, in fact in this same comment chain I have said I have no problem with an investigation twice. 

I am simply saying there is no actual evidence of any wrong doing. Trumps campaign met with people, which campaigns tend to do. Clinton's campaign chairman owns a lobbying group with heavy ties to Russia. 

The very same Russian ambassador who was supposedly Session's contact was sitting with the Dems during the State of the Union speech. This guy is fucking everywhere, so now all of sudden it is evidence for a conspiracy between Trump and the Russians. Come on. 

It is all narrative and little substance. I am shocked that seemingly intelligent people will bite into this bait so hard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a real opportunity for Bernie to have positive messaging and to continue the momentum he may have gathered from the campaign season. Instead he is just like all of the corporate Dems with nothing positive to say for the country, just negative nancy shit about Trump.

It seems like the perfect opportunity for a Dem or left leader to emerge with positive messaging and a willingness to work with Trump for the better of the country. But instead we will just see a reactionary party with nothing to offer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, thanks. I went and got my reading comprehension hat on, and your comment still deserves criticism.

Let me know when that solid evidence gets here. They haven't found any yet. So you are proposing Trump is planning for when the evidence is so overwhelming to have his supporters go after Obama? But they haven't found any evidence after months of trying. 

So i guess you don't have access to more information than Clapper or the FBI...just a conspiracy theory that should come true any day.

<TEXT>  Now Trump supporters will simply claim that Iraq has no issues and shouldn't be on the list.
I wonder how they change their minds so rapidly and intensely.

You are proposing what they will claim, and then questioning how quickly they have changed their minds. So you are wondering about something that you made up. This is a Straw man. I actually looked this up and reference it all the time because people were using the term at my work a lot and they were using it to mean like a wire frame...

A Straw man is a simplified or misrepresented argument you use to easily defeat. It is made of straw, i.e. it is easy to knock down. This has been a popular tactic to criticize Trump. 

Here from wikipedia
A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while refuting an argument that was not advanced by that opponent.[1] One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man

So maybe your's was half a strawman since you didn't quite knock it down, but a strawman still.  </TEXT>

Half of the 'conversations' around here have close to zero basis in reality and it is a circle jerk of epic proportions. So as someone who supports our President I want to point out the straw manning.

You're right though because I am not really contributing to the conversation so I am actually doing similar thing to what I am criticizing...Damn you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well with so many people peddling the Russian Conspiracy theory, i am not surprised CNN assumes Trump is pushing one as well. 

The only thing that seems to be on contention is is Obama ordered the Wire tap since there is significant evidence that one existed, after multiple attempts to obtain the warrant. 

Even James Clapper is saying he saw no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The FBI has said the same. So the wire tapping is the new story, and the Russian angle is being blown out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for linking the article. It is mostly about a proposed plan from Trumps lawyer, which based on the actions of Haley at the UN and Mattis at a NATO conference, this plan is not happening. 

If this is all about Russia wanted better relations then we shouldn't immediately close the door, especially if we can get Putin to act more in line with international standards of decency. 

The sanctions stand, Haley has condemned Russia's actions in Crimea and we have not seen any suspect pro Russia anything, beyond them talking. Which is not unusual given past campaigns have spoken to Iran and other nations. 

If Trump was compromised by Russia I am not sure what to expect to see really. Maybe taking actions that only help Russia? Leave NATO? It's a good question that I am not really sure how to answer.

<TEXT> I do not have a problem giving my opinion, and I do not think it is comparable to your 1979 example. Maybe if you provided an argument for it rather than simply stating it as fact then we could discuss that. I would make a more recent comparison of the Obama campaign talking with Iran, which I am not outraged about but it is a closer corollary than the made up example of Reagan. 

Why would people talk with Russia? I don't know we would have to ask them. The NY Times article that originally broke the story about communication during the campaign said they may not have even known they were and that it could have also been during their normal course of business. 

The FBI deputy director also reportedly told Preibus that the story was BS, why would they do that?

I posed my question to you because there is supposedly a massive conspiracy between the Trump campaign/administration and Russia and I am wondering what the end goal is?

There is so much conspiracy theory being mixed in with the facts at this point it is getting crazy. 

So back to you, why is this worse than meeting with Australia? Do you know what they discussed?

Whether it's McCain or Pelosi they are career politicians who have become multi millionaires while serving the public. Look up how Harry Reid made his millions, because it is all dirty dealing and abuse of power. So the irony is supposedly informed citizens in a Politics sub reddit jumping on the corporate messaging. 

The dislike of Trump has made people willing to jump in bed with self serving professional politicians and corporate media who have no interest is helping or serving the American people.

Damn, Trump chasing wealth and Bannon chasing Power is a compelling image. I don't think they are fascists but if I did or wanted to write a book about it that seems like the best description I've heard yet.

I am trying to find details about VOICE, but it looks like he first mentioned it lastnight. 

I mean I voted Trump and I still support him. I don't call him king, and I think that is just a colloquialism that has come out the group of supporters on Reddit. I like the Trump community here, it is actually a fun subreddit if you like Trump.

Even if you're right about them having fascist intentions, which obviously I disagree with, I don't think they would be able to pull off a fascist qoup of America. The executive branch while too powerful, as we have both agreed, is not powerful enough to take over the Nation. There is plenty of Trump dissent in the communities across the country that there does not seem to be the Nationalist fervor required to go along with some sort of Trumpian take over.

And what would be there goal? He ran on ending foreign interventionism, and reducing governemnt regulation. What would be the goal of a Fascist America under Trump? 

It is actually an interesting thought experiment that I wish I had more time for right now.

My believe in America, which i say often without explaining means believing in our foundations in personal liberty and the Consitution. Maybe I am applying it too liberally to Trump, but not Bannon, in my view.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't mean to imply you were an Obama defender, just that authoritarian has been par for the Presidential course. 

If they start shutting down people who oppose them, in the media and politically then we should worry about them being Fascists, but from what I have seen Bannon and Trump believe far too much in America to be fascists. You cannot support American principles and be a fascist. 

So far I have seen no fascist indicators.

As for the Boy Scout quip, this was my favorite part. I think that the people trying to draw a connection between Trump and Hitler are being disingenious. Dan carlin made a great point about history repeating itself recently on Dave Rubin's show. He spoke about how we recognize the humanity in history and we can recognize systems but that does not mean we will get the same results. I am parphrasing and probably horribly. 

So I may have over simplified with my Boy Scout example, in which case I was doing exactly what I am arguing other people are doing with Trump and Hitler.

I also think the powers of the Presidency appear amplified if you don't like what their doing, but the Presidency has been gathering power for a long time now. I thought it was pretty authoritarian when President Obama killed an American citizen without due process but I don't think he was a full blooded authoritarian. 

We are probably just split on this, and that's ok with me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe some of them, but not the majority. I cannot defend every Trump supporter, i actually think he has a wide variety of types of supporters so to try to fit them all into one box doesn't work. I am consistently called all sorts of labels around here that do not match me simply because I defend Trump. This is not conversation.

Bannon definitely ties traditional christian values to his view for America, there is no denying that. I think this is an important discussion to have actually as a Nation because there was a tradition of Christian values for a long time in the country that has been slowly erroding...rightly or wrongly. But again, this has nothing to do with race, but more ideology. 

To have an honest discussion about Trump and Bannon we should address it they way you are now, not by making it a race thing. I see the attempts to discuss the two of them in terms of race, by either side, as a major impediment to having a real honest conversation.

<TEXT> Yeah i read an article about him referencing Evola, you know i found it interesting because we should not shun people from reading and referencing all sort of thinkers. But if he acts on it like the Italian Fascists acted on it then we may have a problem. But Bannon isn't President either.

To be honest, I read stuff that is intellectually interesting that I do not agree with 100% all the time. Lenin's the State and Revolution is something i will frequently reference but that does not make me a Socialist/Communist by any means. 

I really have not seen anything fascist come out of the administration yet, and having heard Bannon describe his own ideology it could be inspired by pieces of Evola...but he is not a mimic of Evola. 

The only time I see skin color brought up it is by people criticising Trump, not by him and not by Bannon. I recently re-watched Trump's New Deal of Black Americans for a discussion i was having with my brother and in the first five minutes he outlines it as a key part of his America First strategy. The implication being that Black America is a key part of America in Trump's view, which is contradictory to the White Nationalist claim.

<TEXT> I think the comment was about people from Asia, not Asian Americans. Which is less about race and more about non-Americans which you can take umbridge with, sure, but it is not a White thing...it is an American thing.

When taken out of context the comment does sound a lot worse though. I have read a lot about Bannon and watched his speeches/interviews. He never talks about White, but consistently speaks about Americans. He is also talks a lot about Christians, which again you can take umbridge with, but its never a skin color thing. </TEXT>

The article never actually mentions white nationalist anything. He is a Nationalist for sure but White isn't part of the label. 

Saying it is white nationalism is an obvious attempt to turn non white people off to him but it doesn't come from Trump, it comes from commentators who don't like him.  </TEXT>

As a nation it serves our best interest to do both.  </TEXT>

I personally don't think we should be encouraging kids to be identifying as anything besides how they are born until they are adults and can make 'reasonable' decisions. Then they can be whatever they want or are.

<TEXT> My wife and I are working class parents and this would be huge for us. The economist the article sites says that it would be beneficial for almost everyone with kids.

Economist Alan Cole describes the proposal as "generous and broad," noting that "almost everyone with young children will get some benefit from it." However, he cautions, "the largest benefits will go to relatively affluent dual-income families using paid child care." In other words, the people spending most on child care, who need the least help affording it, will be the ones to benefit most. 

but then the author says;

In accordance with all her father's stances, this plan would benefit the rich and do virtually nothing for working class parents, who suffer the most under America's current child-care crisis. 

This does not line up with the economist's analysis and it certainly doesn't line up with what my experience would be in my working class household. </TEXT>

I particularly liked this part

Democracy works only if those who have the money or the power to opt out of public things choose instead to opt in for the common good.

I don't think that more money is always the answer to improving our schools, currently, but a sense of civic pride and duty could go a long way for the coming together of our Nation. The school choice issue is ecspecially important for kids in poor neighborhoods getting access to a quality education but it is not a solution, only a bandaid.  </TEXT>

I can appreciate the example from Obama because it shows what can happen when you take people out of context, it happens to people left and right up and down.

<TEXT> Well I did not make a fake news argument but I will show an example, below of an article representing opinion as fact and applying motive to people(suspected motive, again portrayed as fact).

This came right from the front page of this very sub:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/02/21/trump-is-set-to-introduce-a-new-muslim-ban-this-one-is-nonsense-too/?utm_term=.4c5224f704a8

First thing is the title. There is no muslim ban, but low and behold the Washington Post will call it that.

Secondly, from the article:
2) Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller has flatly stated that the White Houses real goal here is to establish to the media and Trumps political opponents that his power to act (nominally) in the interests of our national security will not be questioned. In other words, the White House has left little doubt that it views the battle over the ban as crucial to a bigger goal: establishing that our institutions cannot constrain Trump.

The author is attributing that goal by taken past comments from Miller and using them to apply motive to the discussed order. Miller did not state that this is the goal of the order.

So in this example the author establishes a premise with the title and opening section that is based off of mislabeling the order and then attributing motive by reading into comments made previously. So it may not be 'fake' but it is more opinion than news. 

Since I am quickly trying to reply at work I will provide an example someone else has put together specifically about CNN:

<TEXT> There is a steady stream of criticism for Trump, and I am not saying that is bad, but I've seen a lot of out of context quoting.  I do think that some major outlets have misrepresented him pretty consistently, especially CNN. 

I do not blame him for not being happy with those outlets. I mean the NY Times article about people close to him and in his campaign having frequent contact with Russian intelligence was all headline. Not to mention the entire campaign when CNN allowed people to say Trump said all Mexicans were rapists every single day.

Unfortunately for Trump not bending the knee to these outlets means even more misrepresentation or quoting out of context.

Secondly unpresidented is a running joke since Trump typed it that way. Lol thanks for the correction though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I concede that could be a way to bring their case but, then give real evidence. The NY Times article about contact between Trump associates and Russia is so vague. The only person they name is Manafort and they say it is also just Trump associates, later acknowledging that anyone who did business in Russia most likely had contact with a Russian intelligence agent even without knowing it.

If it is true then prove it, they empty leaks just seem petty.

<TEXT> Can you show me where his high level staffers had constant contact with Russian Intelligence? I would like to read that. (I found it https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html )

It is not unpresidented for a campaign to talk to foreign governments. Pres Obama's campaign was talking with Iran in 2008. 

The NY Times just had an article about how Russia is not getting the friendly Trump they expected. I can't find it but if I do I will add. 

I just think acting as if Trump is a Russian puppet is over kill for the evidence presented.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But this isn't some terrorist group. It is the President of the United States, if they have actual evidence that proves he is crooked they need to follow proper channels and take action, not leak details to the press. 


What they are doing now makes it look like they don't have any provable case but they don't like him so they are being purposely vague so the press can use their imaginations to build an interesting story. 


Trump said he would restructure the CIA and end regime change policy, I could see some career intelligence officials not liking that. Trump is a game changer and we should also consider the possibility that there are some people in Washington who don't want their game changed. 


Either way rooting for the unaccountable 'deep' state to undermine our elected officials is not a safe bet to make.  </TEXT>

People react proportionately to how they are addressed. I think this is important to point out because you are implying that Trump supporters do not have civilized behavior and that just isn't true of them as a whole...maybe some, but not all. Also if we hold the metaphorical mirror up to Democrats there are some who are uncivilized as well...I mean just look at the name calling in this sub for anyone who is pro Trump.

This is a strategy that can be applied to all interactions, not just Trump supporters or Democrats or politics, etc. If you open the door swinging fists, you will probably be met with fists in return. </TEXT>

I am talking at high level about the outrage culture that is surrounding people opposed to Trump. Like applying race to everything he does or misrepresenting his statements, or implying what Trump supporters care about is somehow not important.

So as he is attacked for literally everything, his supporters are hardened in their resolve to support him.

I can see your perspective on it, but I think the fact that the material that was released was true adds an interesting element, so it isn't just social engineering but exposing the DNC and Clinton Campaign. Also, there was so much bad news coming about about Trump as well(some of it self inflicted) I wonder if they scaled were balanced out?

I also think it was much more ant-Hillary than pro-Trump, meaning they were not trying to get their guy elected, but to prevent Clinton from being elected.

If the intelligence community is really going to make a stand then they need to put all the evidence on the table and let the country decide, this isn't their decision alone. I know they have to keep things secret to protect their methods but this is a very big claim and it needs to be proven. But since it was an anonymous source no one will be held accountable and it will all be treated as true. 

If the intelligence community can back up the claims that Trump is working for Putin then that needs to be published.  </TEXT>

I am totally ignorant to a teacher's relationship with their union so I am sure I could be totally wrong. But, I would be surprised if this individual knowledge makes it to the union level, given the unions income is directly related to teachers income and unions represent a large number of teachers the union has more incentive to focus on things like income. 

Any teachers on here with some insight?

Oh well the best we can do is pursue truth, thanks for the convo!


Edit. I forgot to say that if what journalists were doing with the DNC and HRC campaign is normal behavior then we should not trust them. Letting he. Suggest the questions for Republican guests, giving HRC veto power over articles about her this is not reputable behavior.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I was saying; The DNC and Podesta email leaks contain a large amount of evidence that major news media outlets were colluding with the DNC and the HRC campaign. 

Your right about the end user, but it kind of works towards the point of distrusting the media. We live in a time where we have unprecedented access to first party sources and we should make sure as individuals we are using those sources. I always try to find the original content if accessible for context and clarity. 

So I agree with you, personal responsibility is a good solution for each individual person. I also think that distrust in the media is not some fringe idea, it is most likely a major factor in the rise of online commentators like Secular Talk.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe not NYT but they aren't the only game in town. The media collusion exposed by the DNC and Podesta leaks alone should give enough reason to distrust the media. 

Then there was the president of CNN telling President Trump to watch out because they control the American narrative over seas. 

I mean there are what 6 companies that own almost every single major news outlet, that is pretty questionable to me. 

The distrust in the media is way bigger than anything Trump. 

So there are good guys out there like the Intercept but there are also highly controlled corporate media entities that maybe deserve more scrutiny.  </TEXT>

I will say though that the American family has taken some hits over the past couple decades, so maybe there isn't someone who is against families sticking together but our culture is moving in that direction.

<TEXT> The sanctions thing was proven to be something that was in the works under Obama's admin and was a correction that was necessary...not a concession. 

Do you think it would be smart for our President to talk shit about another countries leader? This seems like it slams the door rather than keeping it open for diplomacy. I think it is wise not to take the bait and start putting Putin down, this may be our best chance to gain favor and maybe effect change in Russian society.

Lastly, the most recent 'defense' of Putin in saying that we have not been so good is the type of honesty I like to see. Trump campaigned on our failed interventionist policy and for him to man up and say that America has made mistakes is pretty big.  </TEXT>

Time and time again Trump has demonstrated that calling him names and demanding action go nowhere with him. However even people who had done that in the past but went and met with Trump come out of the meeting with positive words and with their message being heard. 

If Bernie is genuinely concerned he should try a new approach because the grandstanding is not good for anything but TV. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're examples are such a wide array of detailed topics it would be quite a long conversation to address and cite evidence for everyone. But I think that with examples like Mexico is our enemy and Putin is our friend you are combining multiple items into one category with the theme being either, "Mexico is our enemy and Putin is our friend". But none of the individual pieces of evidence draw those conclusions, the conclusions are yours. 

I don't think the administration is pushing an alternative facts narrative. Conway said that and I do not think she is the best spokesperson for the admins. 

I am glad trump has called out CNN, they have been unfair and consistently lie through omission. The head of CNN even said that they control the narrative overseas and Trump should be nice to them because of it, a tacit threat. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/19/cnns-president-has-fired-a-warning-shot-at-donald-trump/?utm_term=.6ead00edb67b)

So not liking Trump and building a straw man Trump are two different things. I appreciate people with substantiated criticism of Trump but when people throw vague platitudes and Straw Men Trump around they are not moving any conversation forward....they are preventing it.

<TEXT> but when the President is threatening to invade partners 

*I want to warn you there will be links in this, which i know you don't like.*

He did not threaten to invade an ally, the reporting seems to be that that never happened. 
(http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-trump-20170201-story.html)

And, our Ambassador to the UN just condemned Russia. The recent sanctions info is in this link too.

You are working on a compelling conspiracy theory and that's fine. Conspiracy theories can be fun but I would not recommend getting too caught up in it.

It isn't a game. Calling for a Military Coup on a sitting President is not a game. If there isn't proof that the Russians and Trump are working together you can guess they are, or build whatever conspiracy theory you would like, but do not present it as fact.

I recently identified, in a conversation with my brother, that I have an incredibly low standard for what politicians I will support right now; Integrity.

This is corny but I am glad there is at least a community like this one on the web where I can guarantee we all don't agree on everything except for one thing consistently, Making America Great Again.

<TEXT> Tell me the definition then because there appears to be many. these kids may not be fascists but they are acting like authoritarians and have some shared qualities with Fascism. They certainly are not liberal because they obviously do not care about individual rights.

The definition on dictionary.com
http://www.dictionary.com/browse/fascism

 (initial capital letter) a political movement that employs the principles and methods of fascism...

the 14 characteristics on this website (http://www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htm) have some direct links to how the protesters act(they are not a state so not every category pertains to them);


1) Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.

*This is not to say they are American Nationalists, but the anti-fa kids definitely have a strong group identity and they certainly carry flags...they even use them to beat dissenters!*


2)Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.


3) Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.


11) Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. **Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.** </TEXT>

But you cannot call things that have not happened yet lies. The wall isn't built and we do not have resolution on who is paying and how. 

As far as getting money out of politics the lobbying ban for his own team is a hell of a start. 

Draining the Swamp and coal jobs have not had a resolution yet, but that does not mean they were lies.

<TEXT> I don't know. He seems to regularly meet with people who disagree with him and generally both people come out saying positive things. 

I do not however think it likely for Trump to work with people who are denouncing him daily and calling him all the buzzwords. 

Here is a fun snippet from an article I was reading earlier about Bernie wanting to work with Trump and you will see an example of what I mean. 


"Within the last 24 hours, Sen. Bernie Sanders has called President Trumps behavior delusional, dangerous and unconstitutional.

But the Vermont independent also says he wants to work with Trump  if he is serious about standing up to the pharmaceutical industry and reducing drug prices."

Specifically I want to learn about how the first communities were formed, and what the result of the formation of communities was immediately. So if a group of hunter gathers got together to form a community, what was the net benefit to those individuals.

Any answer is appreciated, thank you.

<TEXT> My thought is going after the foreign donors angle. 

http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/foreign.shtml

So it is illegal to accept donations towards a political election either directly or indirectly. It is also illegal to help foreign nationals in doing so. 

Now we get to the stretch that maybe the emails can help us with. We know the Clinton Foundation and State department ran parallel in Hillary's camp. We also know that Hillary was planning on running for POTUS way before she announced in the year 15. A logical argument could be made that the Clinton Foundation has been accepting donations from foreign donors for Hillary. She has been active in office during much of its life and the Foundation activities were commingled with her and her staffs efforts while she served as SOS. 

She signed a pledge to not accept foreign donations before serving as SoS and I think as a Senator because of the obvious implications of influence. She continued to serve or campaign ever since, all the while the Clinton Foundation accepted foreign donations on behalf of her. You cannot separate her public positions and her private foundation and trust her that there is no influence.

The foundation is guilty of accepting foreign donations on behalf Hillary for her campaign. 

Can anyone think of some emails that prove it?

Or other provable crimes with the law to compare? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our country needs some nationalism. We are being ruled by corporations leveraging nations against each other and a government more concerned with globalism than our own nation. The cost of living is rising while average pay is stagnant. We need nationalism to drive infrastructure projects, rebuilding the military and improving our schools. Our poorest neighborhoods need nationalism so we have pride in ourselves enough as a nation to help lift these people from poverty. 

America needs nationalism and those opposed have labeled it White Nationalism, I say no; American Nationalism. It is not a question of color it is a question of one America. 

Don't let the opponents of a Strong America muddy the waters. They say white nationalism, I say no

AMERICAN NATIONALISM.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a crazy idea but what if there was a the_donald SuperPAC that raised its own funds to run digital promotion of Donald Trump or against Hillary Clinton. There would be no campaign coordination, just coordinated shit posts across the web. 

This is using the system to beat the system at it's finest. There doesn't even have to be millions of dollars because of the inherent low operating cost of a truly digital operation. 

I do not know the rules of Super PACs or the first thing about organizing one but I most definitely know about digital promotion and data.

<TEXT> The scary thing is that people are acting like they need to save the country from Trump. There is this notion that he is an imminent threat to our nation; and we must do everything to stop him. 

How far does this narrative go? What is too much to stop Trump? Lying? Cheating? Violence? 

The more media dummies say he is 'literally' Hitler or that he is only supported by white male racists the more the media followers will feel justified in the above. Or just as bad, will feel the media is justified in the above. 

This is scary and truly unAmerican. This is the dictatorial behavior they supposedly fear.
