<TEXT> [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/69llts/my_empire_of_dirt/)

I sat in a boat on the Ashley River, vape and tobacco smoke wafting around, mingling with the cool night air of Charleston.  My hand was crap as crap could be; an ace and a two. I either had a whopping three, or a risky fourteen. I could hit, and potentially go too far. I could hold. I could double down. I could just stand. I looked around the table, sizing up the other three players, until my eyes settled on the dealer. I leaned forward, picked up the joint wed been covertly passing around the circle, and took a long hit before passing it to my left. I held the smoke in for a moment, my eyes still locked with the dealers And then I breathed out, heavily. As the smoke passed by my face, I held up two fingers. Im good.

With a total of fourteen, I won the round. No one, not even the dealer, had totaled higher than twelve; none of them had bothered to make any sort of strategic move. By standard rules, the dealer was *supposed* to take hits until he totaled seventeen But he didnt. It was a perfect storm of impossibilities, resulting in an equally impossible success on my part. Likewise, perfect storms are often the cause of some of the greatest travesties in this world. I spent the rest of the night high and a hundred dollars richer.

As I mentioned in the comments of my first post, I did take a trip out to Folly. I took a walk in the area that I assume Doctor Harlan spent his last Fourth of July on. And I found something Interesting. More on that, and on Doctor Harlan, later. First, however, I dug up a bit of lore about a certain mutt.

The first sighting was, if youre willing to go by folk tales and a few darker corners of the internet, sometime in the 1700s, not too far from Doctor Harlans former place of residence in Charleston, South Carolina.  A tribe of natives supposedly passed this tale on to a friend, who passed it on to his friend. Like a game of telephone, the tale was spread and diluted, rehashed and recycled to form half-baked campfire stories with which to frighten boy scouts. Before I learned of Doctor Harlan and his fate, I might have ignored these events entirely. I might have let them slip through my ears and gone on about my day with a smile, none the wiser to the true nature of this thing we call life. 

Unfortunately, once one starts down this path, it is all too easy to pass the point of no return. And so, without further ado, it is time again for my warning, reader. Stop reading. Exit out of this tab and find something less soul-sucking to feast your eyes on. Forget about Doctor Harlan, his children, and the curious nature of the Hound, known to us only as Muggsy. Put the mystery surrounding the murder-suicide that took place on September 21st, 2010, out of your head. There is only misery of a perpetual nature to be gleaned from it.

A colonist, an explorer, a native boy; our protagonist changes in each telling. For simplicitys sake, Ill call him Nathan. Nathan was wandering the wilds near Edisto Beach; maybe he was hunting for his tribe, maybe he was lost and searching for his family, or maybe he was looking for land to settle. Whatever his goals were, they became irrelevant as night fell. By then, only one task remained; survive, by any means necessary. Nathan managed to start a campfire on the beach, and fashioned a perimeter out of several sharpened sticks. He stuck close to the fire, fearful of what lay beyond its warm light.

It was, they say, midnight. The moon hung high in the sky, stars dotted the black void of space as far as the eye could see. Waves crashed down, and the wind roared through the trees. This was a time when nature was still dominant, and so one can only imagine the sorts of howls and screeches coming from the woods that night. One can only imagine the sort of sensory overload Nathan would have experienced, his heart already thumping violently from the terror of being lost. 

And so, you wouldnt blame him for missing the one noise that mattered.

They say it began as a sort of subtle moan, somewhere just beyond the crashing waves. They say that, as the tide rose, the moan grew louder, more consistent, more voracious. Soon it was joined by another moan, and several more. They began to encircle Nathan, and it wasnt until one of them impaled itself on his perimeter of pikes that Nathan became aware of them. Blackish ooze pooled at his feet as the creature strained to get closer to him. Soon, it was flat on the sand, a pike driven clean through its upper abdomen. Its head was buried in the sand, but its neck twisted, crackling violently, until its eyes met with Nathans.
They say you could see maggots, crawling just under the film of its eyes. Its body writhed and twitched without moving, its bones stuck out in several places, and something *Something* was trying desperately to get out. Nathan was filled with dread, his fight or flight kicked in, and he stabbed the creature clean through the eyes. Maggots spilled out, and suddenly Nathans vision began fading, his body tingling almost violently.

He was, the story goes, found with what would have colloquially been identified as a demon. Modern scientists would have likely labeled it as a water logged wolf or deformed dog. If you paid close attention to the beginning of Jamess story, Reader, you can probably guess what position Nathan was found in. He was labeled a heathen, a blasphemer, a witch. You see, no matter how you spin it, Nathan was guilty of one of two acts. Beastiality, or consorting in the worst of ways with a Demon. And, in the 1700s, that wasnt the sort of thing you simply *went to prison* for.

Some versions of the story say Nathan was hung. Others say he was burned alive. Others still  Well. Others say he was banished. In his exile, the legend goes that he slowly changed. At first, they say, he was simply losing his sanity. Who wouldnt, in his situation? But before long, it was said that his skin became black as night. Maggots filled his eyes, he developed severe anorexia, and his hair grew patchy at best. That, of course, is merely a legend.

I promised to address both my trip to Folly and the next chapter in Doctor Harlans story, but I fear I may only have time to type out the former. I trust that you, Reader, will bare with me. I will explain the reason for my sudden urgency soon enough. That said

I spent a few hours yesterday on Folly Beach, putting myself in the shoes of the Old Man and Doctor Harlan. I was able to locate more or less the exact spot Harlan spent that day at. If one were to drive to Folly Beach, they would find a handful of one way roads running parallel to the shoreline. If they took a left, and continued down one of those roads for a moderate span of time, they would eventually come to a dead end, with a handful of parking spaces nearby. Now, if one were patient enough to park their vehicle and hike down a road for a mile or so, they would come to a secluded segment of Folly Beach, complete with large rocks, a bit of wilderness and marshland, and a fine view of an old lighthouse. 

I brought my camping chair, a small cooler, and my tablet out with me, and spent the day perusing various forums, exploring the strand of beach, and enjoying a cold beer with my lunch. The day in a poor mans paradise helped to ease my mind, which was good, considering what happened next.

A small group of teens- a girl with blue hair, a boy with short black hair, and a boy in flannel and jeans with messy brown hair- bumped into me as I packed up my belongings. The girl, who I now know to be named Jay, apologized profusely. The boy with short black hair, Matt, helped me pick up my chair, which I had dropped on my foot. And, finally, the boy in flannel helped *me* to my feet, as I had fallen perfectly on my ass after yelping in pain, given the aforementioned chair landing on my aforementioned foot.

The teens offered to help me back to my car, which I declined at first. They insisted, however, and so I gave in. The boy in flannel carried my chair, while Jay and Matt continued apologizing to me. I eventually managed to halt the apologies by making small talk, which, damn my mortal brain, led to *the* topic. 

Harlan, you mightve guessed, was relatively shocked to realize his tablet had been on the cooler all d-

Wait, wait, the boy in flannel said. He fished his phone from his pocket with his free hand, and shoved it into my face. This is you?

I stared at it blankly, until I recognized my own words. Y-yes, actually. It is.

Right. Sure. That entire forum is for roleplaying. You just *pretend* shits real, like a-a-a VR game or whatever. How about you take your bullshit story, and shove it waaay up your ass, you fu-

Hey! Jay shouted, shoving him. Bullshit or not, its a cool story. We owe him for hurting his foot, anyway, so be nice, T-

Matt interrupted. Wait, what was that part about the old man, again?

All three of us turned our attention to Matt. Uh-uh-uh, right, um He was an older gentleman, maybe mid 60s or 70s. His name was Carl Roiland, I believe. The black haired boy scratched at his clean shaven chin, debating heavily.

Whats the matter, kid?

I dont really know if I should be telling some random ass thirty-something dude this, but Im Matt Roiland. Carl Roiland is my grandpa. I remember him raising hell about some perve and his mutt out on Folly Beach back before he died

Needless to say, my heart started racing. The contents of the ensuing discussion are lost on me, partially because I wasnt entirely sober, and partially because I was trying to manipulate the conversation accordingly. In the end, I did it. I set up a meeting with Matthew Roilands grandmother, and a few other of his relatives. If this pans out as I hope it does

Listen to me. Even as I curse my knowledge, I seek to enhance it. I crave resolutions, when surely I know there are not nearly enough to ease my hunger. You may have guessed by now, Reader, but my stake in the business surrounding Doctor Harlan and Muggsy is far greater than a mere delivery of information.  Im afraid my time is up for tonight, but I promise to return soon enough, Reader.

As I loaded up my car, the teens made their way back out to the beach. I fired her up, pulled out, and drove off, my windows rolled down so that the wind would cool me down and drown out the excited thumping of my heart. I could hear the waves crashing And a faint moan, somewhere past the horizon.

Goodnight, Reader.

[Goodnight.](https://theprose.com/subject1966)

<TEXT> "The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age."
-H.P. Lovecraft


What would you say if you woke up to an unfamiliar creature laying at the foot of your bed, its stomach pressed into your feet, its paws pressed into your legs, and its snout across your thighs? What would you do if it were as black as the night, and seemed to writhe and twist without moving, without breathing or blinking? If it wreaked of death and decay, if you could swear you saw maggots crawling just under the film of its eyeballs, if its bones showed in several places and something inside of it appeared to be fighting its way out? Would you name it? Pet it? Attempt to train it? If you are anything like me- if you are sane- you might leap up, pry open your door, and run to your car, refusing to return even after animal control arrives.


What if, however, that same creature was more than a mere amalgamation of terror and gore? What if it reached into your mind and placed pressure on a few specific areas, flooding your brain with chemicals that made you fall in love with it? Not merely the love a man bears his dog... But something far more horrifying and taboo? Would you succumb to madness in the wake of those feelings? 


Reader, I will leave you with this, before I disclose to you this tale. Our existence is meaningless. We are not destined for greatness, nor are we fated to scrape the bottom of the barrel of the length of our lives. This society, and all of its hazards and consequences, are merely projections that we created to feel some semblance of safety and purpose. But, in truth, we live in anarchy, and we die meaningless deaths. If you cannot accept your place in the Universe, then you, too, will fall victim to it.


James Franklin Harlan was a pediatrician first, a scientist second, and a father third. If he was not preaching to unhearing parents about the importance of vaccinations, and if he was not subjugating rats to various diseases and potential cures for said diseases, only then might he be found reading a brief story to his meek, albeit intelligent, children. If, on such a day, you were to listen in on Doctor Harlan's bedtime readings, you would also hear the love he bore for his triplets. You would hear this love in his carefully crafted, cartoonish voices. You would hear this love in his pauses to explain difficult words or morals. And, perhaps most blatantly, you would hear it in the closing of the stories, in which he meticulously pecked each child on the cheek and forehead before tucking them in. It is this love that troubles me so, my dear reader. It is this love which has rendered me sleepless on many a night.


Doctor Harlan returned home early in the morning on July 4th, 2010. His children were already asleep, and, to his tired eyes, all was right in the world. He greeted the Sitter, shook her hand, and gave her an extra twenty for the cleaning she'd done the weekend past. He locked up behind her, had a shot of whiskey, and climbed the stairs to the third story of his expensive downtown home, where his study was located. Harlan was not fond of working from home on holidays- especially at two A.M., when he planned to take his children to Folly Beach at noon in eight hours. But he'd been forced to stay behind at the Office an extra four hours, and so his research at the lab ran far later than he'd anticipated. Not wanting to stay the night over, he was left to write his papers here, where he could at least wear a bath robe instead of a lab coat.


For nearly five hours, James typed away, backspacing every now and then to adjust his spelling or reword a particularly difficult sentence. It wasn't until 6 AM that he first noticed the scratching coming from the hall, and it wasn't until 7 AM, with sunlight streaming through the windows, that the sounds truly registered in his mind. He stood up slowly, not wanting to startle whatever pest was mucking about out there, and retrieved his phone from the desk's drawer. Harlan crept out into the hallway, and clicked on his phone- only for it to buzz and ring loudly as it shut off. He cursed and jumped, dropping his phone and startling the creature away before he could see it. 


Heart racing, James bent down to retrieve his phone, still cursing. "Damn things, have enough charge to sound a fucking tornado siren but not enough to turn on a fucking flash light..."


"Daddy," one of his children called tentatively, "I think you scared Muggsy with all those bad words."


James glanced up, his cheeks red as he realized how much he'd been cursing... And then his eyebrows knitted, his forehead creased, and he started rubbing at the skin behind his ear- a nervous habit that he wasn't aware he possessed. "Muggsy? Is that one of your imaginary friends, baby?"


His child, Carla, giggled. "No, Daddy! That's our pet!"


"Pet? When did you get a pet?"


Carla clasped her hands and rubbed her toes on the carpet, looking down and around. "Well... Miss Louise and I found him outside a few days ago, and he looked all sad, so we let him stay inside for a little bit... He was sooo cute, Daddy, so we thought... Maybe..."


James sighed heavily, and massaged the bridge of his nose. Of course the damn baby sitter would bring a stray animal into the house without telling him. He suddenly regretted the twenty he'd tipped her, seeing as the random flecks of dirt he'd been seeing in the guest bathroom now had an obvious explanation. They must've been keeping this animal in there or something.


"Alright," James said. "Show me where Muggsy is, Carla. Please?"


After a few seconds of figuring out whether or not she was in trouble, Carla complied. When James laid eyes on the creature, he was filled with dread, disgust, and fear. The time was 7:30 AM. At 9:00 AM, James found himself loading up the car, his triplets taking up the passenger side seat and two of the back seats, and Muggsy taking up the third empty seat. He had a moment of dissociation, but it faded away as he laid eyes on Muggsy. He felt a sudden warmth wash over him as the thing started panting; a warmth he hadn't felt in nearly a decade. The world seemed... Right. 


The family spent their day on Folly Beach. Carla, Stephen, and Rose mucked about in the water, while James sat in a folding beach chair, one hand scrolling down a few medical articles on his tablet, the other lazily massaging behind Muggsy's ears. It was almost 4 PM before anyone showed up on their section of the beach; it almost seemed as if they were being avoided, until then. The two new comers were an elderly couple, saggier than a wet bag of sand, but smiling brighter than anyone James had seen before. As they drew closer, the woman's smile faded into a look of fear, while the man's faded into a look of disgust. James raised an eyebrow. He shot a glance out to his kids, who were building a sand castle beside some rocks, to make sure they were fine.


"Hey," James called out as the elderly man drew closer.


"Hey," the man replied. "What the hell do you think you're doing? This is public property, sicko."


James stared at the man for a moment, still lazily scrolling through his tablet. "What do you mean? Wait, are you talking about my pet? Muggsy's a rescue, damn it, it's not his fault th-"


James found himself ass-first in the sand, a line of blood trickling from his lip. "What the hell-" the old man kicked him square in the chest. Behind the assailant, Muggsy was standing up, its fur on end. 


"You sick little fuck... Take your-your-your whatever that is and go home, before I call the cops on yo-"

"Daddy!" came Carla's scream. The triplets were sprinting towards the scene.


"Oh, you've got kids here and you're doing that? Y'know what," the man growled. He looked around until he saw James's wallet, then grabbed it, snapping a picture of his I.D., of the dog, of James, and of the scene. "Your ass is grass, you god damned pervert." He tossed James's wallet to the sand, turned, and walked back towards his wife. "Let's find a more public place to set up," he grumbled.


Muggsy padded over to James, then sat by him. Without so much as a thought, James began petting Muggsy again. He started to scroll through his tablet


No. His heart skipped a beat. His tablet sat on top of the cooler, untouched by anyone or anything. 


"Whatchya reading, daddy," Carla asked. His hands were still moving. He began to shake.


"N-n-nothing, darling," he said, his voice hoarse and husky. With great effort, he rested control of his hands and got to his feet. He stared down at Muggsy, his brain working over time, searching for information that had gone missing somewhere along the way. The creature stared back at him, and he felt himself growing hot again. Time seemed to slow around him. He fought it, only to feel his daughter tugging at his hand.


"Play with Muggsy, daddy," she was saying.


James clenched his fist.


"We're going home. Now."


He shoved his tablet into his bag, folded the chair, and grabbed the cooler. Stephen and Rose trailed after him, but Carla called out to them. "You're forgetting Muggsy, daddy!"


He turned, his head spinning. It took every ounce of strength he had to focus. It's worse than a bad trip, he thought to himself. "No, Carla, I'm not forgetting Muggsy. Muggsy isn't coming home with us. Hurry along, now."


James turned again and started walking. Stephen and Rose kept close on his heels. He glanced over his shoulder and saw that, to his relief, Carla was starting to follow as well. Muggsy lingered, its head down and its tail between its legs.


Unfortunately, that's not the end of the story. I wish that it were, for what follows is more hellish than any fictitious work I have ever laid eyes upon. If there is a god, he must have been particularly callous when he heard Doctor Harlan's prayers, for there was no answer. This is your chance to back out, Reader. This tale will leave you more troubled than when you began, and with more questions than answers. While I cannot promise much in the way of genuine resolution, I can promise you *this*. I have taken the Harlan Case into my own hands, and I believe I'm closing in on a valuable piece of information. I will be sure to keep you all [updated](https://theprose.com/subject1966)

<TEXT> Overwatch is from Blizzard. Blizzard is used to constantly adding and innovating its products. I think its safe to say it will reign supreme in its niche. As for outlandish shit- robot dinosaur shooter, space wars, etc, CoD has proven itself willing to get weird. 

I guess I could mention destiny, too, because it fills a certain niche. What I guess I'm getting at is there isnt much that will be big enough to really shake up the genre for more than a few months before it becomes obscure (example being the Division.)

Also, i specifically meant the online shooters; not survival horror or mainly single player shooters. So i'm not counting DOOM or Borderlands in my Over Generalization.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mood rings were heat sensitive rings that changed color when worn. They were cheap toy jewelery and gimmicky carnival rewards that were popular about a decade and a half ago. They might still be popular, but i havent seen any since i was like 5 or 6.

Tl;dr- a "groovy, psychedellic" and very trendy piece of jewelery. OP's joke was that the birds change color based on moods, which is what those "mood rings" supposedly did. I feel old now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fridge horror implied in this is astounding, though, friend. The implication is that rape and domination and enslavement aren't, by daedric standards at least, evil. Your very own criteria suggests that it is only the minds of men and met that make such actions evil.

The insight here, perhaps, is that daedra thoroughly lack objectiveness. If they all merely take an interest in a handful of activities... is it any different from a young Khajiit dabbling in the arcane? 

Now, I am not defending these activities. But the implications of your observation are troubling, and may explain more of mortal affairs than I'd like to admit. </TEXT>

In fallout 3 you hunt a refugee synth. Fo4 takes place in the Commonwealth and centers on synth conflicts.

In skyrim you hunt a refugee redguard who either sold out to the thalmor or betrayed the thalmor. Tes 6 is theorized to center on another conflict with the aldmeri dominion. Maybe Hammerfell with a dlc in the isles? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Chemical Romance's first album, "I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love," otherwise known as the Bullets era, and a few of the songs therein, especially "Demolition Lovers".

Excerpts from the song dealing with bullets

"Hand in mine into your icy blues,
and then i say to you,
We can take to the highway 
With this trunk of ammunition, too
I'd end my days with you
In a hail of bullets"

"All we are, all we are, is bullets I mean this
All we are, all we are, is bullets I mean this
All we are, all we are, is bullets I mean this
All we are, all we are, is bullets I mean this,
 
As lead rains, will pass on through our phantoms
Forever, forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning
Forever, and ever
Know how much I want to show you you're the only one
Like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun

And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood
And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down
And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down
I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood
I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever"

<TEXT> One drop, two drips, three drips, four; James's blood is puddling on the floor. How did he get here? What did he do? He's smiling, crying, and his guts are dying too. His good friend Al waits outside the door, holding it locked, holding it closed, while his wife screams some more.

Al has been around since the day James was born, his Father's best friend and his Father's Father's before. His mom would cheat on John with Al on the weekends, in the mornings when the maids did all the cleaning. When the cookery needed doing she'd screw Al's brains, then throw a bit of Shepperd's Pie off to James's plate. James never liked Al- not before twelve- but Al was always there when all the rest were out.

Al smelled bad, smelled like rot and pain and hate, but Al made mommy happy, and Al made daddy sleepy, and Al stared at James longingly, lustfully, knowingly. James didn't like that. When James turned ten Al snuck into his room, placed a hand on his thigh, and smiled smugly, smiled thinly, and James smiled too. James didn't like it but he couldn't quite see; mommy had dumped a bit of gin into his sweet tea, because he was whining, because he was crying, because her head ached so bad; little did mommy know her head would ache off her shoulders, bursting, bleeding, and all her innards failing.

Al never aged, he was always twenty five, like he sapped the youth from his lovers, from his victims, like he held them down under the covers. When Jane wouldn't drink from Al's long straw, Al didn't like that, no, not at all. But James loved Jane, so Jane moved in; Jane took Al's spot on James's bed, and Al slept behind him, not with him, not lovingly, but ruefully. For a while James was free, but four made far too much company, as Billy was born and Billy roamed freely. Al didn't like Billy; he wasn't susceptible like Jimmy.

"Your fault," Al cried, but he cried it through James; he hit, he scratched, he beat and he came. Jane cried and she cried but her love never died, not for Billy nor for James, for it was Al she would hate, Al she never wanted to so much as date. Al ruined their wedding, threw James to the ground, beat him, beat him, made him throw the cake on Jane's gown. Jane hated him so, but Al didn't care; James thought it was him, and those offenses he bared.

And now James sits with slits in his wrists, at the end of his rope, and he can't even taste the bliss, the bliss of relief, the bliss of the end; James can't seem to taste anything but the burning touch of whiskey at his lips. One last time, Al, James screams loudly, but the cuts go up, not sideways; James is gone, and Al is still there, digging his fingers into Billy, four, old enough to know, old enough to internalize, old enough to fear.

Jane screamed as the men dressed in whites and blues arrived.

Billy cried too, but he didn't yet know why. Al disappeared, but only for a time; but that boy Billy could still see his eyes. "You're next, nephew," Al whispered politely, before disappearing into the closet, where he'd sleep snugly and tightly. Ten years would pass before Al would come out, with Billy in tow, the Billy Billy didn't yet know. And that Billy, the one he'd been raised to resist, drove him to the edge, and so the murders persist.

Throw a drink into anything and watch it dissolve; throw a drink to something good and before long you should see just how horrible, how bitter, your life can truly be. Drunk is not a way of life, but a state of mind to experience once, or twice, but not consistently. A shame it was, your life you wasted, until the end, prematurely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> everyone i have ver liked chooses someone else

everyone i have ever loved chooses someone or something else and i dont know how to cope with it

no matter how much i change and struggle and try to crawl back to positivity, it's never enough

i love a girl that i will call Quart. I've liked her since june and i've loved her since october, but first she was dating someone else and then she was trying to date someone else who absolutely shattered her heart and almost broke her spirit, and now she doesn't like anyone, or she doesn't think she does

five or six months now

she knows my feelings. she has since august. i told her, and when my feelings developed more, i kept her updated. she doesn't mind. she didn't mind. she hates that she can't get over the last guy. 

but someone new. he promised he wasn't going to go after her, but he kissed her this past week and she kissed back but she didn't like him but he likes her, and i can't process anything. she doesn't like anyone she keeps saying she doesn't but i can't help feeling that she will choose him 

nothing i do is ever enough

not for anyone

i feel like im going to die alone

i hate that i get like this. i hate how pathetic i end up looking and feeling. i wish i could just let go and not care at all, but when she's around me i'm happier than i've been in years, and i'm trying so hard to just be happy that way on my own, trying so hard not to make her being around me an obligation or a need, because i hate feeling like i'm some sort of burden, i hate feeling like i'm not happy without her

i want to be happy with her

i can't shake the feeling that he is going to keep trying to do things with her, and eventually she will start to like it, and eventually she will like him, and knowing that she chose someone else again, knowing that i wasn't good enough again, knowing that i'll never have a chance with her- that will hurt. but then wagtching more and more of her time go to him, watching myself fade into the background, becoming a fall back, it will kill me and i won't know what to do anymore

i'm fucking helpless

matters of the heart are impossible

you can't do anything to fucking change them

when he's not around her it's fine, i wait, im patient, im calm

but i know no one ever chooses me

ever

if there s compettion im going to be passe dup

because im never good enough

i feel sick sometimes, i feel fineothers, i feel beyond confident sometimes, if eel like trash others

tonight i feel sick and like trash

i'm not always this way

but when i am it makes it so much harder to feel okay again and to be myself again

because even when i am happy i feel like i just want to be loved 

i give everything i can. i do everything i can. but its never enough, and im never loved back.

i justg neeed something to distract me and stop me from freaking the fuck out until tonight is over. im not suicidal i just cant handle being alone with my thoughts on nights like these </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Baron smiled at me, the bright light overhead reflecting off the slime on his yellowing teeth. His skin was tinted orange, his hair bleached; long and luxurious white robes flowed down his body, masking his true shape and size. Perhaps he was a lean, towering, giant of a man. Perhaps he was as a crone, his back misshapen and body frail. Regardless of what he was, his army of Crakors had caught me. My hands were cuffed to the pipe behind me. I managed, with effort, to stand, to face him at eye level.

"You're a monster, you know that? You slaughtered them- all of them, and for what? To capture a damned Prince? My father isn't even dead, you dolt, much less willing to pay a ransom for me. So what's your game?" I let my voice rise steadily, threw in an edge and a growl as I went. I'd learned a thing or two in Downtown Theater. If I put on a good enough show, maybe he'd shit himself and let me go without a fight. 

Wishful thinking. My mind was already crafting a plan B and C, knowing damn well A wouldn't work.

"My game," the Baron asked. He smiled, his hands folded around a silvery staff. Power was flowing off it, invisible to the naked eye but strong enough to burn my skin, even from a good six feet away. "is not one of diplomacy. Your father is a cruel man, my Prince; he was beaten bloody by your grandfather, disciplined and hardened until nothing but contempt for the world remained. He sees only war, and until now, has had no reason to believe he could be stopped."

I pressed my back against the pipe I was chained to; the Baron was drawing closer, and the intense heat from his Relic was beginning to burn. "If it's not about diplomacy, then what is it!? Why'd you take me and not my father? Why me, and not the heir to the throne? Roderick would be the next in line- if you sought to cripple the Kingdom, why would you go for the lesser Prince?"

The Baron hesitated, frowned, licked his lips. "You sound so certain that Roderick is fine- that he himself isn't already dead."

My heart stopped for a moment, before I saw the lie in the Baron's eye. "Impossible. Roderick is kept at Father's side, day and night. He's being groomed for the throne as we spea-" 

The Baron's grin returned. I'd stumbled into the answer.

"And if Roderick is being groomed by Father... it stands to reason his rule won't differ all that much."

The Baron patted my shoulder. "There we are. Naturally, Roderick is turning out to be a fear mongering, bloodlusting little prick in the side of the betterment of the World. You're all but dead to your father anyway, my Prince. When was the last time you saw him with your own eyes?"

I thought about it. 

"Christmas, almost a year ago. He's forced me to stay in the Sister Palace ever since."

"He'll never know you're gone; not until you turn up at his doorstep with an army in tow."

I stared at this man, wide eyed... And then that stare turned into a glare. Treason. "And where in the nine fucking Hells am I to find an army willing to die for me? You expect me to take on the Kingdom- all fucking twelve of the realms- and usurp my Father's throne? Are you insane?"

The Baron laughed.

And laughed.

And laughed. And then he hefted his Relic into the air and drove the sharp end through my chest. It burned; the wound cauterized as he drew the mystic weapon back out. I gasped for breath as my vision returned. 

"I just might be, boy, but I'll not be taking no for an answer... Will you be a Puppet King for me?"

I drew in a ragged breath, turned my eyes up to his, and spat. "Never."

The Baron leaned in close, until his nose was touching mine. His breath was sour, drenched in wine. "That answer will change, once you come to understand true insanity." He rose to his full height, turned away from me, and tapped the Relic three times on the ground. "Send in the Bison Fucker," the Baron boomed. 

He left the room with six long strides; the mechanical doors whirred shut. Somewhere behind me, another set of doors opened. I tried to twist myself around the pipe to see, but could only barely make out a large, blood-soaked knife, bobbing up and down through the air.

"Buffalooooo," came a twisted, broken voice. It sounded like a man, but with the curiosity and innocence of a child... "Buffaaaaalooo," he called again. His voice had gone up a few octaves; I could practically hear his heart beating as adrenaline built up in him. His naked feet slapped wetly on the ground, a sharp sting touched my right arm, a harsh grip crushed my throat, and suddenly a faceless man was staring into my eyes, an eternal, lipless grin pressed against my mouth, saliva dripping down onto my shirt. He was hungry, his face had no skin, and his knife was digging into my right arm. It burned just as intensely as the Baron's staff; it was a Relic.

"Buffalo!" The Faceless Man screamed, and he carved a chunk out of my arm. "Buffalo, Buffalo," one of my fingers was between his teeth, blood sprayed onto his pant legs. "Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo-" with each utterance of the word, the Knife dove into my stomach, lopped off an appendage, carved a new symbol into my skin and muscle and bones.

"Buffalo," the Faceless Man said, one final time. He gripped my head and slammed it into the pole. Just as consciousness began to flee, I saw the Faceless Man retreating. The Baron had returned.

This wasn't the end.

<TEXT> the knife presses into coro's arm, pinches at the flesh, draws out a little bit of blood. the brown coat is smiling maliciously, his eyes alight with some hellish flickering feelings. the brown coat has had coro here for days, since before the council invoked the mutual morals act.

what the council had not anticipated was this; the enemy did not need to kill to win. they only needed to have greater numbers. the enemy simply captured its foes, broke them, diced up the unnecessary bits and left the rest hanging in a room somewhere, getting fed the absolute minimal nutrients by machines. not a single human was being killed; they were just being removed from the battlefield.

coro, however, was not a human being. coro was a divine, and the brown coat knew it. his blade drove deeper into her arm, poked at the bones, scratched at the runes inscribed on them. coro bit her lip, focusing all of her power on keeping the ichor from flowing. if it flowed...

"Of course, you'll know exactly the reasoning," the brown coat said. "It only takes a drop, and then any mortal creature transcends, takes on a totally new biological makeup. Just one drop, dear, and it can all be over."

coro yelped as the knife drove home, piercing her arm bone and letting the golden ichor flow free.

'the council,' she cursed to herself. they'd failed to consider one simple fact.

'it is a war crime to kill another human being...'

humans may not kill humans, no; but humans could kill divines. </TEXT>

Dead snow.


Loathe to speak, less to hear.


Angsty teens, man.


What was that for?


Snow hills.



Loathe to speak, less to hear,

Lest I whisper in my ear.

Snowy hills and great sand dunes, 

too often I find both remind me of you;

barren baroness, having made me a widower,

the snow, the sand, the trees- all i've seen, and been, and gone to to die

i find you in it all, and your face, taken in tragedy,

watch as it stays my hand. you always watch, damn you, and refuse to let me visit.

Loathe to speak, less to hear,

some nights, my mind grows queer

calls you a bitch and a whore and a monster and worse...

god, to not be in *pain.*

Snowy hills and sand dunes, and trees, and seas, these eyes've seen it all, baroness.

Shall I visit? Is it time? But no, you don't listen to the words. The pleas I give you.

You'd rather I move on and live.

Loathe to listen, not to hear.

I'll keep wandering, then.

Maybe meaning will come. </TEXT>

Rather than a light descending from the ceiling, it was as if the light were being reflected from another room. *My* room was brighter than before, sure, but...

I looked up, taking a long moment to process just what I was seeing.

My father sat on the foot of his bed- the one I'd taken to the dump three years ago, to make room for my own- with an ice pack and tissues wrapped around his thumb. My mother sat with him, rubbing her hand up and down his back, calming him. It was like... Like staring through some sort of two way mirror, but... So... So much *weirder.*

I noted, absently, that I'd crossed the thresh-hold, and that I was now standing at the foot of my own bed, staring up. A spot of blood dripped from my dad's tissues, fell to the floor of their bedroom... And plummeted onto my neck. I wiped it away with my shirt's collar.

*Seven, Seven, One... Seven, Seven, Seven, One... Seven, Seven, One.*

My heart halted again, the feeling I'd gotten washing over me again. The image on my ceiling was gone. I was left with... An urge. An urgent urge. I heard some sort of sharp *rap-tap-rap* behind me. The door. At this hour? The urge grew stronger. I held the bat in my right hand, and with my free left hand, I reached into my pocket, groping for my phone. 

*Rap-tap-tap,* the door declared again. But not the front door, I realized; I'd never closed the front door. I turned and, to my shock, realized the bedroom door had shut itself. When the *fos'la* had I done that?

The urge. 


*Seven, Seven, One...*


I typed the first number,

**RAP, TAP, TAP**, the door was screaming now. Something was wrong, incredibly wrong, but my mind, damned as any human mind is, was twisted, confused, drifting aimlessly in space from the pot and the caffeine and the all around *strange.* I typed, my fingers flying, even as I felt myself raise the bat, even as I felt my arm muscles twitch.

*...Seven, One, Seven-Seven-Seven One, Seven-Seven*, my body seemed to be electric, impulsive jolts that were not stemming from my brain guiding my hands as they locked my phone, slammed it down on the bed, gave my father's bat a death grip, and slammed the aluminum thing into the skull of... Of...

"*Fos'la,*" I asked aloud, "what in the hell *are*-" but I didn't have time to finish, because this thing, this thing with too many eyes and too few clothes, and far, far too much free-hanging flesh, was clamoring back to its bony feet, reaching its anorexic arms down, wrapping its skeletal fingers around its flesh, ripping at it, unleashing fucking *maggots* from inside itself and onto my floor. I slammed the bat into again, and it slapped against the wall, its flesh sounding like some sort of wet trash bag. I gripped my phone, typed the final one, and hit the call button.

In one moment, the Many-Eyed Entity was clamoring towards me; in the next, I was alone in my room, with one noticeable difference.

The carpet- the one I'd put in a few months after my father's death- was now tile. 

*Seven, Seven, One. Seven, Seven, Seven, One. Seven, Seven, One.*

My mind was leaping through ideas like a frog across a freeway. Daylight streamed through the windows. My bat still hung at my side, my keys were still in my pocket. The bedroom door was open now, though. *Fuck,* I thought, and then I stopped. "*Fuck?*" The word was... Alien. I made my way back to the living room, noted the Pizza Hut box said 'Pizza Hut' again. To my shock, my car was sitting in the driveway. I reached into my pocket, used the keys to unlock it, and, hands shaking, popped open the trunk.

There sat a wooden bat and a flashlight.

*Seven, Seven, One. Seven, Seven, Seven, One. Seven, Seven, One.*

I stared at my phone. My hands were shaking. Again, I began to type. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Seven, Seven, One. Seven, Seven, Seven, One. Seven, Seven...*

I slammed on my breaks, my heart louder than the music I'd been blaring for the past three hours. *Bump... Bump...* 

It wasn't some strange sixth sense, or a *thing* that was physically visible, or even the peculiar number he'd left on my desk today. *Seven, Seven, One. Seven, Seven, Seven, One. Seven, Seven, One.* No, nothing that predated this sudden burst of pure *instinct* was the causation; perhaps, like some sort of odd quirk in my perception of the world's linear flow, *this was* the causation, and not of the current *effect*, but of those things which preceded it. My mind, my *foslir'ein* mind... It feels... It felt, it feels, like I've been drugged. Not like some sort of date rape drug, either. It feels like someone dosed me with LSD or... Something... Something...

That feeling. That blood-halting, bone-freezing, brain-killing feeling. *Fos, fos, bloodied **foss,*** I'm thinking. Thought. I felt.

I put my car into reverse, moving the stick slowly, methodically, as if I were learning how to drive again and my mother were sitting shotgun, white knuckles gripping the aptly, affectionately named *Oh Shit* bar, just a breath away from screaming at me to stop and let her drive instead. I turned off my lights, and I backed up until the stop sign that marked Jessa Avenue was hidden behind a row of bushes.

*Seven, Seven, One...*

Only now did I know what halted me. Only once the *thing* was out of sight, was my mind able to process it properly. There had been something... *Wrong* about the sign. Something horribly, unnoticeable-y wrong, something that I wouldn't have noticed if not for that *fos'a'* number. *Seven, Seven, Seven, One...* My road had never been Jessa Avenue, not before today. Not before the number. *Jessup Avenue.* I'd grown up here, inherited the house after my father hung himself, after my mother left him for a tragic grave. 

*Seven, Seven, One.*

I took the keys out of the ignition, popped open my trunk, got out, and shut the driver side door as quietly as I could. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and I was regretting the bowl I'd allowed myself at the start of this drive. I also regretted the constant stream of coffee I'd consumed since reading those numbers; neither the pot nor the caffeine was helping my addled mind remain calm. 

From the truck, I withdrew my late father's aluminum baseball bat (a memento that doubled as protection, I used to tell myself, in case my car broke down in the middle of no where) and a flashlight, then pushed down on the trunk, applying pressure slowly and silently until I heard a soft *click.* I gave the bat a quick spin, recalling how my late mother would play 'Obi and Ani' with me back in '03, before she got bad. She'd use this deep, horrible British accent and pretend to be Obi-Wan, and I'd be Anakin, and she'd train me with these nerf swords that we painted to look like lightsabers. My dad, a B-list voice actor and casual baseball player, would put on his best Jar-Jar impression and cheer me on.

I approached the house in darkness, having turned the flashlight off after rounding the corner and using it to inspect the Once 'Jessup' sign again. Sure enough, the 'Up' had changed to an 'A'; I hadn't hallucinated again. I'd feared, briefly, that I'd fallen victim to those latent episodes they warn you about in Elementary school, where a trace of LSD crops up a decade later and drags the victim back into some horrible trip before frying their brain.

*Fos'a',* I thought. D.A.R.E was still getting to me, all these years later.

I held the bat tight in one hand, slid the flashlight into the inner pocket of my leather bomber, and fumbled with my keys. I hesitated for two heart beats, then pushed open the door whose green paint had been chipping away for years. I stood, my bat wielding hand hanging limply at my side, my other on the door knob, and stared into the most welcoming abyss I'd ever seen.

*'Ware that what fakes a limp*, Stephen King once wrote. I pulled the flashlight free of my pocket, flicked it on, and turned the beam over every inch of the living room. Empty hot-pocket sleeves, check. A half-drank can of piss-water-beer, check. PS4 left on because I'm a lazy *Fos'a'ked,* check. But then, there. The empty box of pizza, left open on the coffee table.

*Pitzae Hu'ut*, it said.

"What the foslir'ein..." My voice trailed off. Another variable, another *thing*, completely different from any memory I possessed. Pizza Hut:Pitzae Hu'ut. Jessup Avenue:Jessa Avenue. Red Wagon Suites:Nairskuel Inn. My preferred Pizza Chain, my Street, and my fucking *job.* None of them possessed the same names that they'd had. I was gripping my father's bat the same way my mother would have gripped the Oh Shit bar, when I, on a whim, turned the beam of light upwards.

Footprints.

*Seven, Seven, Seven, One...*

I led the light along the muddy trail, until it hid itself behind the hallway's wall. I made my way- tentatively- across the room, set my flashlight down next to the half empty can of piss-beer, and flicked on the living room lights. Next, I moved towards the hall, now able to see as far as my bedroom door. The footprints curved down the wall, onto the carpet, back up along the ajar white door, and disappeared into the shadows of my room. 

Where the prints touched the floor, they were not muddy. Instead, they seemed... Green. No, more than green. They were, my mind concluded, *grass.*

I flicked on the light and followed the trail, now gripping the bat with both hands. I paused for a moment, bending down to examine the grass prints. My mind was taken back more than half a decade, all the way to my first real memory. 

I was sitting in front of a pile of lego bricks, mostly ignoring them, save for one large green one, which I was slamming on the ground to the sort of rhythm only a two year old boy could hear. "*FOS!*" My father shouted from outside. He came barreling through the back door, gripping his thumb inside his shirt. "Sandra, I missed the nail again," he called. Blood was seeping through his white button up, and his mud-coated boots left a trail of large footprints on the then-wooden floor.

Staring into the grass, I noted one small splotch of red, and a chipped bit of nicotine-yellowed finger nail.

I stood, my breath caught somewhere inside of me that was not my lungs. I dared not cross the thresh hold into my room- the room that my parents called their own years ago, that I'd since moved into. Instead, I poked my father's bat into the shadows and used it to flick on the lights.

The lights- my lights, rather- did not flick on.

*Seven, Seven, One...*
