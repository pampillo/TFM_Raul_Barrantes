<TITLE> How do you read books? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I know this might sound stupid at first, but please bear me for a while.

There are two ways to read. First, go word by word. Second, read fast, while soaking in the general idea and not worrying about every emotion or detail.

I tend to take the first route, but at the expense of consuming fewer books. For e.g., in Pride and Prejudice, I have to reread lot of sentences to exactly understand what's going on, because of its archaic style. The same happened with me when I had read The Great Gatsby and Midnight's Children, because of their high-end vocabulary. I limit the second approach for *lighter* novels, such as those by Sidney Sheldon.

At this point, I should clarify that I am not a newbie reader. It is just that I am slowed down by my attempt to soak in everything that the author has to say, and I am now wondering if I should read faster, albeit with lesser comprehension.

So, what do you suggest? How do *you* read books? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have taken lot of interviews for my company. Two instances stand out:

- I was having a dull day at a recruiting event, because the candidates were all poor. Suddenly, I was sitting in front of this guy from Walmart Labs. I had heard that Walmart Labs asks really difficult questions in its interviews. And since this guy was an employee, and so must have cleared their interview in the past, I couldn't ask him the usual simple questions I was asking all day long. I brought out the big guns, even one difficult question that I had never asked before  The candidate didn't disappoint and handled all of them comfortably.

- One of my favourite questions is how to design a monitoring and automated alerting system, on a high level. The problem isn't as easy as it sounds. Needless to say, I have seen lot of folks flounder in it. And I remember a guy who used a stream, such as Kafka, to build the system. He also handled failure scenarios properly. I was impressed! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with everything *except*:

 I'd chat with the engineer tomorrow and tell them you're interested, talk about road map, etc. And see if you'd be a good fit.

I'd suggest you first talk to the hiring manager: either ping him to meet you over coffee or setup a short 30 minute 1:1 with him. Find out if he indeed has open positions in his team and what kind of prior experience he is looking for. If you sense he is interested, ask him if there's anyone on his team you could talk to further.

In other words, reach out to the hiring manager *before* talking to someone on his team. </TEXT>

Last year, there was a period of about 2 months when I wrote *lot* of solid, complicated code. However, these days I am designing a large system, that involves evaluating bunch of technologies, writing a 10-20 pages long design document, getting it reviewed on 2-3 different forums and incorporating feedback. All of this *designing* and stuff easily takes up 3-4 months. Only then will I begin coding it up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why would you advise someone to do what he's already doing?

This isn't the same as trying to relocate within a company. For e.g., if the project you are working on goes into maintenance mode, you stop getting quality work. However, you have more context in your current company to find out other projects or teams that are still going strong. If you move to a different firm, it is difficult to judge the work quality of the team that you are about to join or influence the team selection.

All of this is, of course, if your current company itself isn't shitty. </TEXT>

Anyway, it's totally OK to not know lot of things in the beginning of the job. What is not OK is that you don't put effort to ramp up, something that is fortunately not the case with you. So, I'd say, 'Relax! And take it easy'.
Also, it can be overwhelming to learn so much in such a short time. Rather, start slowly, first with technologies that are needed in the short term on the job, and gradually move on to more things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmmm, makes sense. I never liked the idea of *owning* things that I could avoid, but I guess that is important to some folks.

On the other hand, "it's not just 1s and 0s being played back"- *that* is just in your head! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't know vinyl has superior sound quality. Gotta check that out sometime.

By the way, will vinyl also beat music playing on Bose speakers? :-P </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, the uncertainty factor is always there. Still, I think I can take my chances.

I guess the side effect of pay increase, both in current company and in future as you mentioned, is going to be significant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a Software Developer at a big MNC. I have two options in near future:

* Stick with my current team, where I have a decent chance of getting a promotion by next October. Pros: Bigger paycheck after promotion. Cons: I have (sort of) learnt almost everything that is there to be offered. So, won't improve much on technical front.
* Screw the promotion and move to some other team, and learn more about a new and (possibly) interesting technical and business domain.

Thoughts? </TEXT>
