<TITLE> My first time being home alone </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-05 04:47:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I grew up in an okay part of town. My mom didn't work and my siblings and I are all around the same age. One morning we were all getting ready for school and I stepped on glass. I was going to make everyone else late, I couldn't find bandaids and what not. My dad took my siblings to school and I got to stay home. Score! 

My mom and aunt went shopping and I had the whole house to myself. I was about 13 and honestly I didn't even think of dangerous things happening. 

I sat outside for some time in the yard playing with our cat and reading a book. I grew bored eventually and went inside. I was watching tv and I noticed a man creeping into the window. When I jumped up he looked scared. But then he knocked. I thought since he knocked and didn't run away it was cool. He asked me about a beat up car in the drive way. I told him I would let my dad he was interested. 

Looking back now I realize that he was trying to figure out if I was home alone. 

I shrugged it off and continued watching tv. about an hour later, I heard someone trying to open the kitchen door. I got a little spooked and moved into an adjacent room that had glass doors connecting to the yard. I heard a window being rattled with. Then I heard the glass door next to me being tampered with. I was so scared I couldn't even breathe.  Looking back it gives me chills knowing the sheer terror I felt right before possibly being attacked. 

After this my glass door was being fucked with I heard a tiny bathroom window being messed with. The bathroom window was never locked it was high up and took some effort to reach. I took this as my opportunity to get the fuck out. 

I ran out from the front door and started screaming about having a gun and camera in the house. (I was a tween idk I thought this would work) 

I got to my neighbors house and waited for my parents. My family asked the entire block if anyone had seen anything suspicious and NO ONE saw a thing. Needless to say I was scared and I still hate being home alone.

I (being the sober one) sat upfront and saw she received a text it said "He was an asshole anyways" followed by a bunch of other supportive texts. I asked if she would stop for a booz run and she did. After grabbing a few bottles I got her a little cactus. It made her smile.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in high school I was pretty ugly. There was a girl that would do anything to make my life miserable. I ended up graduating early and going on with my life. (Not ugly anymore hey) I stay off social media and only talk to one or two people from back then. Long story short she never graduated and has two baby daddies and no car. I ran into her at the grocery store a few months back. She looked a mess. I wasn't too happy with this karma since kids born to poor moms are a sad statistic.  </TEXT>

If this is some  you'd like to see long term, disclose. If not then do the deed and it's cool. Scars are not scarey. If you bleed or leak you might want to give a heads up so there's no surprises.

<TEXT> Shiiiiiit. Buy a stun gun online. Also turn off the WiFi at home, maybe this guy is cyber stalking you and your family.  Next time he's around try to do something to his car to make it more recognizable. Paint? Break a window from a far.  Make sure you're safe tho. Get all locks changed. Don't talk to anyone anywhere. I just want you to go back to college lol. I'm so annoyed for you.  Get the locks with the old school chains. Alarms on the windows. Um yea. I don't know. Try to get a paint ball gun those things hurt too. A bow and arrow a dog idk . Oo set up a spare Webcam at the entrance of your home and watch from your phone maybe you'll be able to recognize him.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work with a company that places bank levys. It will take a week or 2 to have the issue resolved dispite what the bank/collector tells you.  Cash your checks by a Third party. Anything that goes into your bank account will not be taken back out until the issue is resolved. Also might want to call your payees so they aren't charging your card and getting more fees once this is over. </TEXT>
