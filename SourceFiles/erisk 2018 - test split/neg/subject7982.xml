<TEXT> Homer, but I think Seahawks are going to lead the NFL this year, or at least try. Everything Pete and John have done recently lends itself to that idea. We are currently sitting at 13 RBs on our roster, including a top-3 of Lacy, Rawls, and Procise.  We picked up Pocic in the draft, who was a great run-blocker for LSU. I think there is a decent chance we go back to our bread and butter, if they can get the O-Line somewhat better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly it's a lot more than just THC level. Taste is a big one as well, as more expensive strains usually have more terpenes. More expensive strains are usually much less harsh on your throat and lungs too, and will generally burn easier. If I roll a joint with cheap weed it goes out more than the expensive stuff. Same with pipes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, but I just want to correct you on that last statement. If I go buy Purple Kush at the store, I can buy a ton of different price points. It comes down to so many different things. Was it grown indoors or outdoors? How gently was it treated? Is there a lot of crystals? How big is the nugget? How long was it dried? Did they use pesticides? Etc. All of these questions can lead to good and bad products, even in one single strain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so since I've enjoyed edibles, err, quite a bit, I can help you out.

First off, most edibles are candy, mints, or baked items (cookies, etc). Not all, but a good bit. The reason for that comes from a few different places. The first is that candies are easy to make with cannabis infused. One of the easiest ways to prep cannabis for edibles is making an oil or butter, and since so many candies and treats use these two ingredients, it's an easy jumping off point. A second reason is that weed can have a powerful flavor, so the sweetness of the treat can balance it out. 

So, the next logical step past just these treats is to use it in actual cooking, like in this video. This is where it gets really interesting. One of the basics of cannabis is that there are a ton of different strains. A lot of these strains have much different effects from one another. They also have different flavors. For beginners it's a bit difficult to pick out flavors, but they are definitely there. 

**Much like how certain alcohols are used in cooking and provide certain flavours, did the cannabis also provide a different flavour/aroma/sense to each dish?**

If you use these different strains in different dishes, you can absolutely impact the dish in different ways. One of my favorite strains I ever had was a Mango Kush. It naturally tasted pretty good (although I'm "seasoned" a bit, and can taste the flavors underneath easier, kinda like Wine). I would have loved to use it in a fruit based dessert. 

Now here's the problem though. As I mentioned before, cannabis has a pretty strong flavor in cooking, especially for beginners. Imagine never trying cilantro in your life, then finding it in a cookie. It absolutely changes the flavor of a dish, it's just up to the chef on deciding the best way to use it.

**Were there different dishes that brought out different aspects of the cannabis that would otherwise go unnoticed if simply smoked in a joint?**

Well, sort of. If you take one strain, and use it in all the different ways of consuming it, you will absolutely notice different things. With Mango Kush as an example, while smoking regularly I might notice that it's relatively smooth, and the smoke isn't as harsh. If I use it in my Wax pen I can really taste the mango flavor. In an edible, you can definitely highlight the flavors of the strain, especially if you pair it well. 

**What other side effects were there from consuming the cannabis in such a prepared manner?**

Okay so this is where you can go really in depth, and it's also where chefs have to be really careful if they are cooking like this. I live in a "legal" state, and I can go to the store and by edibles. By law, these edibles must list how much THC is inside them, generally it's 10mg per cookie or mint. Now with 10mg, my mom will eat one and be good the rest of the night, while I would need 3 or 4 to have a really good night. 

The problem with this comes from time-to-activation. When you smoke a joint, you will usually feel the high within 10 minutes. But with edibles, you have no idea. Depending on how big you are, how much food is in your stomach, and how experienced you are, it could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. 

You have no idea how many times I've seen somebody eat their first edible, say it's not working eating, eat 1/2/3 more, and later on regret everything. That's why a chef would have to kind of hedge their bets against this, potentially by letting people choose how experienced they are, and preparing the dishes accordingly.

Aside from this issue, you have the different effects from different strains. And to give you an idea of how this impacts people, I'll just lay it out how I would plan a meal like this in my head. 

I would first start with an early appetizer, and pair it with a strain that I know sets up the person for the rest of the night. There are two main categories to choose from, Indica and Sativa, and a bunch of hybrids that combine the two. Sativa heavy strains are good for physical activity and keeping you up and active. Indica are more "heavy-head" strains, and are good when you know you have nowhere to go and want to sit and enjoy a movie, music, etc. 

So in the case of the appetizer, I would definitely go with a Sativa heavy. From there, I would look at the various Sativa strains, and find some that have effects I want. Since it's early, I would avoid anything that is know for being too giggly. Alternatively, I would look for something that makes people more "euphoric" and out-going. 

You can kinda see how theses choice could apply to the rest of the dinner and all that. Hopefully this is a good primer, and please let me know if you have any other questions! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted this before as an idea for a full Minecraft Let's Play, but it could work under the King series too:

---

The Tri-Wizard Tournament

Recreating the Harry Potter Tri-Wizard Tournament, except instead of a big Goblet the final goal is to mine the Tower of Pimps.

The first task emulates the dragon task in Harry Potter. A large Obsidian Pit is made, with viewing areas on the side. One side of the pit is the entrance, the other side has a small raised area with a chest. Between the two sides is a Wither. The chest contains some regular apples, plus one golden apple (Withers love apples). Lowest time to steal the Golden Apple wins.

To mix it up a bit, and make it more like the Harry Potter Experience, each contestant will draw before the match to choose the Wither's assistants. This will be something like three skeltons, three creepers, three zombies, or something else. Just something to make that much harder.

The second task is the lake task. There will be a large lake, and the bottom will be covered in chests. For each contestant, one single chest will hold a block of wool that is their assigned color. They need to find that block and bring it to the surface. Once again lowest time wins.

The final third task will of course be the maze. The person with the best time of the first two tasks goes first, and so on. They will be armed with an iron sword and a diamond pickax. The maze should be dark and full of terrors - like zombies and spiders. First to find the Tower of Pimps and the center, mine it, and bring it to the judge on the outside is the winner.

If you die you have to restart from the outside of the maze. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely call (or better yet, go visit) the Silver Bow Fly Shop in the valley. They are experts, and they collect fishing reports daily from around the area so they can help you a bunch. I do know parts of the Spokane River are closed right now, including potentially the area you like, so you can ask them about that too. 

Also, if you do fish the Spokane River in that area, it's probably best not to eat the fish. They say one serving a month, but in my opinion I don't care enough about eating the fish from there to risk it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't necessarily agree that NK reached a critical stage, but he has a point. NKs previous missile and nuclear tests were all building block or proof-of-concept style tests, at least as far as public knowledge goes. They proved the stuff can work in theory, so the logical next step is the refinement stage. 

With this new stage, NK would be attempting to refine their nukes and refine their missiles to do better. We have already seen this with them claiming to both have hydrogen bombs, and miniaturized nukes. Even if these claims are doubtful, there is no doubt they are still working towards it.  

In the missile refinement stage, their recent military parades and missile tests show that they are now working on missiles that have maneuverability in the terminal phase. Although they have apparently yet to succeed, this is one of those things that makes defending against them that much harder. 

So, at least to me, there is a critical point in North Korea. That point is whenever they can take all these tests and displays, and make them actually usable in warfare. While they may not be there yet, a lot of experts seems to think they are getting there quick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Didn't you see the newest season of Dancing with the Stars? To boost ratings, they added a Q A section, whereupon the contestants are judged on their response to questions like the following:

 - What do you see as the biggest issue facing small business owners in today's economy?

 - What are some ways smaller film/tv/online productions can mitigate a sudden drop in ad revenue?

 - What are the socio-economic effects of an island nation allowing foreign fishing corporations to utilize their territorial waters?

The joke comes from the fact that the "regular" contestants will generally be prepared for these questions, while the pros will not and will usually "dance-around" the question at hand. 

Ratings overall are still dropping, but the show has seen a massive influx of new viewers aged 60+.

Edit: I have no idea where the fuck I was going with this comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The dichotomy between the two articles on the sub right now is kinda funny. One is trying to say we don't need a stamp of approval from anyone, while the other lists reasons why we're so "hip". Nothing against this writer, but I think Spokane should aim for it's own, unique identity.

While some people like to make fun of it, or make their own ("Spokane doesn't suck"), our city motto is a good jumping off point. We don't have stuff that other cities have, *because* we have stuff that other cities don't have. 

We have 5 ski resorts within a two hour drive. We have a river running through the city that is both breathtaking and float-able in different spots. There are 17 fishable lakes within the county alone. Incredible hikes are within walking distance of downtown.

I just think some people are looking in the wrong direction for Spokane. We don't need to be a follower, when we are already a trailblazer. If we try and follow the cookie cutter mold of a big city, then we lose our identity overall.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of MAD doctrine. MAD came about because the US and USSR could theoretically destroy the entire world with their nuclear weapons. North Korea is nowhere near that capability yet, and I would argue that the goal for the US and our allies, plus China, is to never let them get close. 

However this mismatch in number of weapons means that NK and Kim require a completely different doctrine, different than we have used before. Their apparent willingness to use weapons of mass destruction (the VX assassination), combined with rapid development of miniaturized nuclear weapons puts the world in a spot it hasn't been in before. 

People keep trying to assign old Cold War roles to North Korea, when it should be evident that they are a different beast entirely.  </TEXT>

Alternatively, maybe this isn't a bubble, and these openings are in response to the population growth and average age of the city dropping (I think). I guess it's hard to say.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everybody. My family and I are looking into putting a game we invented on Kickstarter in the somewhat-near future. To give you a quick rundown, it is a Golf/Putting game, played on a fake grass surface that will be marked with lines, circles, and labels.

With this surface, we have a set of rules that are simple, but unique to the game itself. As far as I can find, there are no other games that have rules like this, but it's also simple enough that we can explain it to somebody knew within minutes.

Before we publish to Kickstarter, we would like protect our work so, in the unlikely event it become truly popular, we have protection from people stealing the idea. 

From my research, I believe that I would need to file for two different protections. A design patent for the gaming surface, and a copyright for the rules (plus a Trademark for whatever name we come up with). Is this correct? Can somebody let me know what I should do instead if it is incorrect?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For sure. In fact they even said him and Aleks don't get any money from Cow Chop, despite starting it, as they want all of the money to go to the channel and their friends they work with. 

And no harm! Their humor definitely isn't for everyone, I just wanted to make sure nobody would get the wrong impression of James from this video alone. As a comparison, it would be like calling Michael a dick based on Rage Quit alone (which almost all of us know is false).  </TEXT>

But yeah, if you didn't like this episode you probably wouldn't like Cow Chop as a whole. Their humor is based on stuff like this, RT knew what they were doing when they brought them on this show.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a good point. The casualties issue is a tough subject, and I'm not sure how we could mitigate that. Maybe lower speed limits through Spokane County? I'm really not sure.

For the Oil Spill, I think this should go hand-in-hand with the BNSF/UP firefighting team. They should absolutely have a local oil spill mitigation team, and should also work with the county on plans for a potential spill in the future. 

See the issue I see with some of these proposals (like the one in the article) is that they hurt BNSF's bottom line without giving them any benefit. That means that BNSF is going to challenge it in court no matter what, and you're not gonna find many lawyers better than those working for Berkshire Hathaway. 

Alternatively, if the city works on a mutually beneficial plan, we could work with BNSF without involving lawyers and court time. I just think that would be better for the city as a whole. I think if we make BNSF the "enemy", then we will never get anything done. 

Then again, this is all just guess work and conjecture, and maybe making them the enemy is the best way to go. It's really hard to say.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So it seems to me that BNSF/UP would gladly spend thousands of dollars fighting this, especially since a plant to reduce the flammability would most likely be incredibly expensive (although that is just a guess). We might be able to convince them to cover Coal however.

I wonder if there are alternatives that BNSF and UP would consider that wouldn't be as expensive as this other solution. Maybe setup a simple foam firefighting system above the tracks downtown? BNSF also has a foam firefighting train car at their yard in the valley, so it would probably be beneficial if the local fire departments developed plans with them to fight any potential oil fires.  </TEXT>

Did you read the article at all? California Sea Lions aren't endangered, they are increasing in numbers! What has actually happened is that we've essentially set up a buffet for them at the base of dams. These Sea Lions have learned that it's a lot easier to go catch fish at the base of a dam instead of trying to catch fish in the open ocean while avoiding predators like Killer Whales. 

If anything, the animal we are really hurting are the fish themselves. Not only do they have to deal with a large dam/fish ladder they have to traverse, they now have new predators that were never there before.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As of right now, NKs largest missile is only about 50% successful. So let's say they fire four missile at us. We would expect only two of those to really get up to space. 

At that point, it first comes down to the US Navy. Depending on how many destroyers we have sitting in the Northern Pacific, they  would need to somehow make it past all of these ships with their AEGIS systems. Furthermore, they would also need to make it past the Japanese Navy, which also has ships equipped with AEGIS.

So if they get past all of these ships, they will then probably be flying over Alaska (assuming they fired at West Coast). In Alaska, we have thirty ground-based interceptors, so it would then need to get past these as well. 

So if they get past all of these ships, and the ground-based missile defense, they would finally have a shot at the USA. At this point they would need to actually hit where they are aiming, which they haven't shown yet. They could be aiming for LA and hit the Nevada desert (or something like that).

While our missile defense is by no means perfect, it's currently best-suited for states like NK that go "rogue" without too many missiles.  </TEXT>

---

8:00 AM: The committee steps off the plane, four members wearing nice clothes, so obviously out of place on a plane landing in Spokane. They introduce themselves, Bob (1), Bob (2), James, and Pam. 

8:15 AM They've collected their bags. We make small talk on the way to the curb. I think Bob 1 has thing for Pam. They let us know that they judge cities on a lot of criteria, but it really boils down to how lively a city is, and how beautiful it is. They apparently last visited Gary, Indiana, so I think Spokane gets a big boost right off the bat. We enter the Davenport Van. I mean, where else would they stay?

8:25 AM: I offer them brownies we picked up on the way to the airport. They all have one. Bob 2 says he's hungry, and has 3. Oops. 

8:30: I begin the "tour", pointing out some great sights on the way from the airport to Downtown. The business park near the airport is showing a lot of promise. Finch Arboretuem is a small piece of heaven next to a busy freeway. Sacred Heart is well known for it's Children's Hospital and Cardiac work. 

9:00 AM: We arrive at the Davenport. They get checked in as we go over the history of The Davenport and surrounding areas. Crab Louie Salad was invented here you know?

9:30 AM: We make it to our first real stop. The Museum of Arts and Culture in Browne's Addition. I notice that they all have red eyes. Bob 2 was singing to himself during the van ride.

10:00 AM: The Museum is going great! Bob 1 and Pam are watching a documentary, James is looking for a vending machine, and Bob 2 is having a staring contest with a large stuffed Mammoth.

10:30 AM: The committee requests/demands food. We take a walk over to Frank's Diner. I make Bob 2 walk on the inside of the sidewalk.

11:30 AM: Our total came to $107.54 for the five of us. I make sure to give the waitress a large tip, as James and Bob 1 got into a very loud argument about McNuggets. Pam also requested 7 water refills throughout the meal. Bob 2 is surprisingly coherent. We had a discussion about Spokane's Medical and Educational investments. 

11:35 AM: The van comes to pick us up and take us to Riverfront Park. I offer all of them all another brownie. They all accept. 

11:50 AM: We arrive at Riverfront Park. I note that the construction is a sign of improvement and investment. They pose with the runner statues. 

1:00 PM: After showing off the Riverfront and Huntington Park (They were memorized by the Falls), we load back up in the van. We now head to the Perry District. They like the Windmill.

1:45 PM: We load up in the van, and head up the hill. We stop at the Rockwood Bakery. They really enjoy the treats here, and the coffee really helped them wake up. Bob 2 nearly went comatose. 

2:15 PM: We arrive at Manito Park. It's beautiful. They like to feed the ducks.

3:00 PM: We now head North, we stop near the Monroe Street Bridge to look at the falls and grab some more coffee at Indaba Coffee. I mention that Kendall Yards is turning a former rail yard into a brand new nice neighborhood.

3:40 PM: We pass Garland Theater while heading North. James notices that they are playing Star Wars. He demands to stop. I thank my lucky stars they have bottomless popcorn. 

6:00 PM: We get out of the movie. I had to wake up Bob 2 and Pam. The other two enjoyed the movie. The van picks us up. I offer them all a brownie. They all accept. We head downtown. 

6:15 PM: I think about what to do for dinner. I had planned on doing something fancy, but in their current condition I decide on something more appropriate. We head to Dick's.

6:45 PM: The Van driver lets me know there is an extra charge for cleaning up a Whammy off the floor. Bob 1 takes offense to this. The van driver leaves. I guess we're walking everywhere tonight. 

7:10 PM: We stop at 7-11. James buys some cheetos. Pam asks me for another brownie. The Bobs are talking about the city with a citizen, who looks homeless. The man mentions Otto Zehm. I intervene.

7:45 PM: After giving them a choice of locations, the group decides that they want to bar crawl. We make it to the Hogwash Whiskey Den.

8:20 PM: The group apparently likes to drink. *A lot*. They are extolling the virtues of Spokane, so I'm not one to complain. 

8:35 PM: As we head north through the tunnel on Washington St., a bum whistles at Pam. Bob 1 takes offense to this. I try to diffuse the situation, and mention that the group is judging the city. The Bum starts yelling about about the City Council. We head North.

8:45 PM: We reach Sprague St. James notices the Barcade down the street, and runs off to that. We head the opposite direction to the Satellite for some more drinks. 

9:10 PM: Pam really likes Long Island Iced Teas. I put it on Fagan's tab. He'll never notice. 

9:30 PM: James comes back. He asks for quarters. I make him stay with us. I stop Bob 1 from fighting a bouncer. Bob 2 has slammed 6 shots of Whiskey in the last hour and a half, but is still surprisingly coherent. He wants to discuss the socio-economics factors of our new Pedestrian Bridge being built. 

10:00 PM: I'm exhausted. The committee is full of energy. I call us a taxi, and have them take us to Cliff Drive, overlooking downtown.

10:30 PM: We're at Cliff Drive. Downtown is beautiful. James is looking at the stars. Bob 2 is no longer coherent, and is now puking over the guard rail. Bob 1 and Pam hold hands.

11:00 PM: They still aren't ready to go to the Hotel yet. I tell them one more bar. We head to Jack and Dan's. 

11:30 PM: Bob 2 just slammed more whiskey. James went to grab Star Wars from a Red Box across the street

1:00 AM: Bob 1 just got 86'd. We're going back to the hotel. Bob 2 is coherent again. 

1:45 AM: They're finally all in their rooms. Well, Pam isn't in *her* room. I think today turned out well.

8:00 AM: I meet them in the hotel lobby, ready to take them to the airport. They decide to stay another day. They like Spokane. I offer them all another brownie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really hope this succeeds. That whole area is really a big blemish for Spokane's downtown area. 

I think one of the biggest issues for this area is access. Take a look at Division on the Northside, or 29th on the South. They constantly intersect with major arterials that give people easy access. Sprague, alternatively, meets up with Division near downtown. But then there are no major intersections (meaning major North-South roads) until you hit Freya 2.5 miles down the road.

I think one of the best things they could theoretically do would somehow connect Hamilton to Sprague. [Looking at the map of the area](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.6575941,-117.3961445,17.04z), I think the only viable solution would be something using Sprague Way. You could design it in a way to emphasize 2nd St as the faster way downtown, while Sprague would be for more local access. 

Would this be expensive? Probably, but I definitely think it's a hurdle in this whole situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know much about video streaming backend, but maybe I can help troubleshoot until somebody smarter in the subject shows up.

Is it always 7 seconds that it crashes at? M3U8 (the stream) uses a streaming system where it constantly grabs from a playlist and plays them in sequential order. Just throwing the dice, but maybe it's crashing when you try to grab the next file in the playlist? I'm not sure how long each streaming section is, but 7 seconds sounds about right. 

Also, when you say crash, is it a tab crash or a browser crash? Also, I'm assuming Chrome browser?

A couple of things I would try:

 - Check for extensions that could be causing issues. Disable each one-by-one and test

 - Reinstall browser and plugins

 - Temporarily disable firewall/anti-virus and see if that helps

<TEXT> Interesting. My guess is they are testing two system. One would be a system to disrupt GPS to a certain area. The second, in conjunction with the first, would be a system to avoid this in our planes and vehicles. 

It says some of the tests are centered at McChord, and some at Bangor, throughout the month of April. So it involves the three main branches most likely, which means it's a good sized test. I wouldn't be surprised if part of this would be jamming to stop drones, since they are quickly becoming a dangerous weapon to US bases and soldiers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know a guy that gets seatbelt tickets regularly (he has the money to pay them). We asked why and he told us that if we could prove seatbelts are safer then he would wear one. When we brought up the statistics on reduced injuries and deaths, he just brushed off those stats as government lies.

So yeah, that's the type of person that doesn't wear one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so basically video cameras work by taking a bunch of pictures and putting them together really quickly. When somebody says frame, you can basically pretend they said picture. So 24 pictures per second.

If you only see less than 10 pictures a second, your mind can still perceive them individually as pictures. But once you start going over this number humans start to see motion. 24 FPS was chosen because people seen it as motion, and back a while ago people would range from 22-26, so they chose 24 in the middle.

Higher can be better for multiple reasons. The first is smoothness. 60fps is good for video games as it makes the game smoother. Higher fps is better for slow motion too. If you record at 60fps, and playback at 30fps, everything you film will last twice as long.  </TEXT>

*Thursday - 2PM: Matt Hullum is in his office, doing a 1-on-1 with the camera* 

**Matt:** Yeah you know I think we really run a tight ship around here at Rooster Teeth. We have our issues, but overall I think everybody really works out.

*As Matt finishes his sentence, a quick loud knocking is heard at the office door. Chris's voice can be heard*

**Chris:** Matttttttt! Maaaaaaattttttttt! Matt! Matt! Matt!

*Matt gives an annoyed/exasperated look to the camera.*

**Matt:** Alright alright! Come in Chris.

*As soon as Matt finishes speaking, Chris slams open the door. The door knob hits a makeshift stopper taped to Matt's wall. Chris then slams the door shut, which leads to a Master Chief action figure falling off a shelf on the wall*

**Chris:** Maaaattttt, Blaine won't stop stealing my juice!

*Behind Chris's back, Blaine can be seen peaking through the window to the office. Matt notices him, Chris does not.*

**Matt:** Well Chris, that's a serious accusation. Rooster Teeth does not condone thievery!

*Matt gives a quick smile to the camera*

**Matt:** In fact Chris, why don't you tell us how he stole it?

*Chris gets a big smile on his face, and sits down in the chair opposite Matt's desk*

**Chris:** Okay well I guess it all started back on Tuesday. So I came in to work that day and I was really tired, right?

*Matt gives a small nod and a slight smile. Chris begins to speak faster*

**Chris:** And well I knew I needed something to drink, so I started to search and I found a drink, and I went around asking people if it was theirs and everybody I found said no but I didn't want to take it yet because I didn't want to be a thief like Blaine but then I looked at the label and it said free so I took it and then I drank a little and it didn't taste as good as I thought so I went back to my office and I put it in the fridge to make it colder and I forgot about it until today so I went to go get it and it was gone! And Blaine stole it!

*Once again the door slams open, hitting the ragged taped up stopper on the wall. Blaine rushes in and also slams the door, leading to another figure falling off the wall shelf. Matt facepalms, and gives Blaine a tired look.*

**Blaine:** BULLSHIT! Bullshit! Bullshit bullshit bullshit! That was my FUCKING drink!

**Chris:** No it wasn't! It said free on it! I asked everybody!

**Blaine:** You didn't ask me asshole! I was in the bathroom!

**Chris:** Yeah... But it said free on it.

*Blaine pulls a bottle out of his bag and points at the label*

**Blaine:** You stupid ass! Does that look like it says free to you?!

**Chris:** Well yeah, it says it's filled with sugar, and it's free!

*Chris smiles at Matt, obviously hoping he will take his side.*

**Matt:** Chris, that says sugar free, as in, it has no sugar.

*Chris get a surprised look on his face.*

**Chris:** Ohhh... So that's why it tasted like shit!

End Scene

---

*Friday - 9:15AM: Achievement Hunter office. Michael and Lindsay are the only two in the room. Lindsay is sitting on the couch on her phone. Michael sits at his desk, the camera focused on his face. Behind him, in-frame, the door opens. Gavin walks in. Michael glances back*

**Michael:** Oh hey Gavin, sup?

*Gavin grunts back, it's easy to see he's still tired.*

*Cut in scene to Michael in a room talking 1-on-1 with camera*

**Michael:** Gavin and I have a great relationship. I fuck with him, fart on his shit, prank him, just generally be an asshole. And he always responds by sputtering and saying some British shit. It's pretty great overall.

*Cut back to AH office. Gavin sits down to his desk and turns on his computer. Michael gives a sly smile to Lindsay*

**Gavin:** Oi! This isn't my keyboard. It looks like it's in Latin! And my computer! Bollocks! All the words are in Latin too!

*Michael starts laughing*

**Michael:** That's Spanish you idiot!

*Gavin's voice raises, he's yelling at this point.*

**Gavin:** Michael where is my keyboard?!

*Gavin starts to stomp and bang his desk. As he stomps, a squish sound is heard. He looks under his desk*

**Gavin** MICHAEL!! You put dog shit under my desk too?!

*Michael's face looks confused. At this point the door slams open and Geoff runs in*

**Geoff:** Ahahaha you smarmy British Fuck! I did that to piss you off!

*Gavin begins to gag, and grabs a garbage can nearby*

**Gavin:** Geoff! *dry-heave* Clean up this dogshit! *dry-heaves again, head in can*

*Scene cuts, now it's Geoff doing 1-on-1 with camera*

**Geoff:** Yeah I love fucking with Gavin. Keeps him from getting too cocky, you know? Also, that was totally my shit. 

*Geoff winks at camera*

To me, they actually shouldn't have put GTA and Minecraft on there. Instead, I personally think AH should have put one Let's Play a week on the Let's Play channel. The other four days should have been a mashup of Let's Play's from the other groups.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one of those questions that can get tons of varied answers. Here are some of the questions that can help you determine though:

1. What airline do you use the most?
2. What hotel do you use the most?
3. What would you value in your card? Cashback, perks for other travelers, free checked bag, etc.

But here is the big question:

**What deals are currently going on?**

In my case, I recently got a Delta FF credit card, and I got 50,000 bonus miles for spending over $1000. However a week or two later the deal had changed and it was only 10,000 miles for 1000 spent. So it really depends what deals are going on when you buy.

In terms of subs that can help, I would also check out /r/churning, since they know what cards pay out well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the history of the rancher being opposed to wolf reintroductions and advocating for their extermination

Well I absolutely believe that could be the case. Tons of ranchers up here believe that. But yeah in this case the ranchers themselves seemed to be somewhat okay with wolves. This is from a local newspaper:

That rancher and another producer with cattle near the Profanity Peak pack had been taking steps recommended by the department to avoid conflict with wolves, Martorello has said, from deploying range riders to picking up carcasses to avoid attracting wolves, and turning out calves when they were bigger and more mature. He praised the ranchers cooperation.

As I was researching this, I think I found the person you were talking about with the scientific credentials, and it sounds like he wrote an article that had many inaccuracies. The University he worked for published some retractions:

https://news.wsu.edu/2016/08/31/wsu-issues-statement-clarifying-comments-profanity-peak-wolf-pack/

However I do agree with that same writer under some circumstances. He thinks Ranchers should have to sign [this agreement](http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/gray_wolf/livestock/agreements.html) with the state in order to receive protection, and I think that's a great idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I know what you are talking about, and that's one hell of stretch to make the rancher sound that bad. In fact, the rancher basically exhausted his options for dealing with the wolves:

*Producer 1 is the rancher I believe this comment is talking about*

 In this case, Producer 1  who experienced
all but one of the depredations by the Profanity Peak
pack  turned out cattle from June 8-10. The turnout
location, predetermined by the producers allotment
plan with the Colville National Forest,

So his location to turn out his cows was determined in part by the National Forest Service, not "he knew the local wolf pack was raising a litter".

However, by the end of June, an analysis of three
weeks of collar data from the two newly collared
wolves confirmed that the location of the packs den
site had changed since the previous year

They found out the wolves had moved their den in late June, but the Rancher turned out his cows June 1st. 

The proactive deterrence measures Producer 1 had in
place included calving outside of the known occupied
wolf habitat... The
local Wildlife Conflict Specialist concurred that these
proactive deterrence measures were suitable for this
particular grazing situation and were in place long
enough to meet the expectations in the protocol.

So he used proactive deterrence measures, he didn't "send them right through where they slept"

the local
Wildlife Conflict Specialist recommended adding a
range rider as a reactive deterrence measure, which
the producer did soon afterward.

So even spent more money to try and protect his cattle. Unfortunately, as the wolves killed more and more cows throughout the summer, the majority of the pack was removed. But there is no way you can completely blame it on the Rancher, it looks like he tried his best.

<TEXT> Hi Dan,

It looks like it's a bit finicky. If you have an Android phone, you can cast your screen to the Fire Stick and try it that way. With the computer, however, you have to go a bit outside the box. 

http://www.alphr.com/microsoft/microsoft-windows-10-1/1002529/how-to-mirror-windows-10-to-an-amazon-fire-tv-stick

Here are some instructions. I hope they work for you!

As a side note, there are other options if you are willing to spend a bit more, or if the above doesn't work. If you have an Xbox One or (I believe) a PS4, they both include RT apps. Alternatively, you could buy an HDMI splitter, and place it between your CPU and monitor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah absolutely. It's definitely a balancing act. There's also the issue of people just not liking increased foot traffic and cars in their neighborhoods, which I think is a valid complaint if not taken care of correctly.

Overall I think that Kendall Yards are better than the Perry District in terms of helping the city. If it ends up failing it won't "doom" a bunch of people. Generally the people living there are well-off enough that they can respond to issues like that. It also allows for solutions to traffic issues by designing to projected traffic levels from the start, not retrofitting an already developed area.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I think the gentrification of the Perry area is a bit different than the Kendall Yards project. The issue people have with gentrification is that it moves into what is already a low-income neighborhood, then revitalizes it. One issue is that the revitalization can make the cost of living in that neighborhood too high for the people that previously lived there.

Kendall Yards is different because there was no real neighborhood there before, it was crap land. Theoretically they could run into an issue where the surrounding neighborhoods have their cost of living go up. But for the most part the higher cost will be in Kendall Yards by itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Frank:** You enter the cavern that the quest-giver Joel sent you to, taking a second to re-orientate yourself to the darkness. On your right you see a wall covered in what looks to be portraits of Gods, some sort of memorial to those long gone. On your left you see a coffee machine and a small kitchen. 

**Orma:** Do I see anything out of the ordinary?

**Frank:** Roll for a perception check

**Orma:** 17

**Frank:** As you look around the room, you hear small footsteps hidden in the shadows. As you investigate further, one of the small creatures runs past your foot, and you manage to grab him by the scruff of his neck. 

**Frank:** While picking him up, you all notice that he looks like a gnome, similar to the ones you have back home. He has large feet for his size, and short brown curly hair covering his body. As you hold him he starts to yell and try to slip out of your grip.

**Creature (high pitch/squeaky voice):** ^(Hey put me down! Knock it off!)

**Orma:** I'm going to try to talk to it and calm it down. 

**Bor Ealis:** Who cares, just kill it so we can move on!

**Frank:** When the cretaue hears this he starts to struggle even more in Orma's hands.

\*Orma ingnores Bor\*

**Orma:** Hey Little guy! Don't worry, I won't let that mean man hurt you. What's your name?

**Frank:** He finally stops struggling and looks up at you. You notice some hair is discolored around his eyes, seemingly forming the shape of rectangular glasses.

**Creature:** ^(Well... My name is Burnsy Musk and I'm a cave gnome! Can you let me go now?)

**Frank:** As you talk to this gnome, you notice that slowly more gnomes are coming out of the shadows. They all start to gather around Orma at her feet.

**Orma:** I'll let you out if you answer some of my questions first! We're supposed to be looking for a really really bad guy in this cave. Have you seen him?

**Burnsy:** ^(Oh you must be talking about Pongus!)

**Frank:** As Burnsy says the name Pongus you notice that all the gnomes on the ground suddenly respond. Some gasp, other cover their eyes, and one of the larger gnomes with a big beard and nose ring take up a defensive position with his small spear.

**Orma:** Can you tell us more? What is he like? How does he fight?

**Burnsy:** ^(Well he's ugly, big and purple! He's got soft wool skin, so maybe use fire. He has a big horn that he likes to try stabbing people with, and when in danger he can fly for short periods of time!)

**Orma:** Do you know if there's an easy way to kill him?

**Burnsy:** ^(Well he's missing an eye, so if you aim for his other eye you can make him blind! But watch out, because if you get to close he can stick out his tongue and catch you so he can eat you!)

**Frank:** At this point some of the younger gnomes scream and run back into the shadows.

**Orma:** Alright guys, looks like we have our next battle. A one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater! Let's get to work!

**Burnsy:** ^(What does that mean??)

<TEXT> So I disagree with the premise as a whole. While RT undoubtedly has a very large under-18 fanbase, at it's core they shouldn't be "teaching" these fans about life. They will definitely influence these younger fans, but if these younger fans are getting all of their "life knowledge" from RT then they might have bigger problems down the line.

It's kind of like the argument against the Simpsons when it first came out, or South Park, or GTA. People liked to point at these and say "Aha! That's the cause of all these issues in these kids!" While in reality, these shows and games are only a small part, and the actual majority of a kid's upbringing is on the parents and those around them.

So really, it comes down to how a kid is raised more-so than anything else. If a kid has two alcoholic parents, you can probably make a good guess how it ends up. Not 100%, but most of the time that's pretty bad for the kid. 

However, aside from this, you may have a small point with the drinking, especially in terms of binge drinking. They do have a lot of fans that are late high school/early college age, and this is where it gets dicey. They should know RT isn't a "monkey-see monkey-do" kind of company, but I'm sure some forget that. This could potentially lead to some of them going to a party/gathering, and thinking they can chug half a fifth like Geoff can, or take swigs of Vodka like Gus. RT is under no obligation to correct this, and they shouldn't be. 

But at the same time, maybe they could just make a bit of a joke out of this. If Michael is slamming Riot Punch they could have a warning at the bottom: "WARNING: Michael is a professional drinker. Please do not try at home." Or maybe have Michael actually attempt to slur that out when wasted. Like I said, it's not needed but it does address the issue is a slightly funny way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this Roosterteeth Store Gus takeover, and would love to see them do other cool stuff with the store. If you ever have been on Woot.com, you might have seen a Woot-Off. I think it would be awesome to see the Roosterteeth Store do something like that. 

If you haven't been on Woot, it's pretty simple. The store would pick a day to do the Sales, then through-out the day they would pick certain items to be part of it. They would put up one item for sale with a good discount and only a certain number available. Once that item sells out they put up a new item and start again.

If they really wanted to mix it up and create interest, they could spice up the offerings. Maybe in between two regular sales they could do special flash sales. One item with a very small quantity for like 90% off. Or 100 random signed items for $5 each. You would obviously need to put in limits, but otherwise would work well I think.

The benefits of doing something like this are good for both the customer and the RT store. The customer might get the chance to buy something they were waiting for a price drop for, and also get a chance at something really cool for really cheap.

Alternatively, the RT store gets the benefit of having people "camp" the website, and also can clear out old inventory if needed. They could even sweeten the pot other ways to get people to buy more stuff. Like Woot will do $5 all-day shipping, anything you buy on site that day is covered. 

I just think it might be a good idea, because I know I sure would be paying attention to the site like a hawk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah this article is nice with how it talks about Gonzaga, but the rest contains a whole lot of bullshit. I mean, first, lets look at a single paragraph:

For a while, that success was nowhere to be found, especially not in sports. The city has long had a minor league baseball team (the Spokane Indians) and a hockey team of the same level (the Spokane Chiefs). There was an arena football team for a few years (the Spokane Shock), but that disappeared when not enough people showed up to games. None of these teams were much to be proud of (and most of them were rather racist in name).

Yeah so a good chunk of this paragraph is wrong. Let's look closer. 

For a while, that success was nowhere to be found, especially not in sports. The city has long had a minor league baseball team (the Spokane Indians)

In the last 30 years, the Indians have made the Playoffs 9 times, and of those 9 times won the championship 8 times.

and a hockey team of the same level (the Spokane Chiefs).

Out of the 60 teams in the Canadian Hockey League, the chiefs consistently ranks in the top 10 for attendance. They won their championship, the Memorial Cup, in 1991 and 2008. They were the first American team to win the Memorial Cup on Canadian Soil.

There was an arena football team for a few years (the Spokane Shock), but that disappeared when not enough people showed up to games. 

Okay so here is where it gets even more bullshit. First, the Spokane Shock were overall pretty damn successful. In their four years in the AF2, they won two championships, in their inaugural year and the final year of the AF2. They then moved to the AFL for six years, making the playoffs in five of those years and winning the championship in one. Three championships in ten years of operation is not a bad team.

Furthermore, the attendance part couldn't be further from the truth. They led the AF2 in attendance for all four years, and were top ten in the AFL for attendance for all six years. The AFL mostly folded because other teams were having attendance issues, not the Shock. 

None of these teams were much to be proud of (and most of them were rather racist in name).

I'm absolutely proud of our teams, and I'm not touching that last statement with a ten foot pole.

I'll keep digging through the article, but there's so much wrong with this that it's incredible. Hell, just with a quick glance I found this:

In 2004, Spokane taxpayers were happy to help pour $25m into the McCarthey Athletic Center, which seats 6,000 screaming fans. But the new arena hasnt had significant effect on the towns struggling economy as a whole.

Yeah not even close to true. Here is what the Gonzaga Bulletin says:

Construction of the McCarthey Athletic Center was funded through varied sources including private contributions to Gonzaga's Capital Campaign, corporate sponsorships, business agreements and the men's basketball ticket sales, according to the summer 2003 issue of Gonzaga Quarterly.

So yeah, overall, this guy has no idea what he is talking about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would almost call it a "speculation" bridge. The neighborhood where it will land right now isn't the best. That's why some in the City Council nicknamed it the "Bridge to Hookerville." However the speculation part comes from the fact that the land around where the bridge lands, due to the issues, is pretty dang cheap. 

The goal of the bridge is to get developers to buy the land on the South Side of the bridge near Sprague, and essentially turn the neighborhood around. Avista has already invested there, buying multiple lots both on Sprague and one block North. We could see more developers buying up land soon, especially to build apartments and dormitories for the University District. 

So really, it could end up being useful and smart, or it could fail and we wasted a bunch of money. At this point it could really go either way, although with Avista's acquisition of a bunch of property I would lean towards useful as of now.  </TEXT>

**If Achievement City were a real city, what would the citizens think of the main group?**

---

My name is John, and I live in the forests of Norther Nor North Havermeyer, Achievement City. I keep to myself for the most part. The place I call home is a small dugout on a hillside, barely noticeable unless you are actually looking for it.

Achievement City is a larger "city", if you can even call it that. A group of adventurers seem to run the city from Downtown, acting like they own the place. The income disparity is incredible. I've even heard one of their members has a massive mansion, yet it's completely empty. 

It's hard to get by out here in Havermeyer. I tried to ranch one time, getting myself some cows and pigs. But the next day, all were slaughtered, except one cow. I thought they may have had some mercy on me, leaving me something to survive with. But at some point a strange man from the group came and stole my last cow, muttering about holes and a man named Edgar. 

I occasionally try to observe the main group, just to learn what they do and how they operate. I learnt pretty quick that it's best to stay at a distance. They have no regard for safety, diplomacy, or tact. At one point I even seen them playing with Creepers!

To an extent, they seem to be religious, or at least idolatrous. Some follow the same religion I do, praising Dan the Man (Greatness be upon him). Other seems to follow a very large man named Jack, who will bless those he deems worthy with his Holy Water stick.

At the core, their main focus is usually Gold. They collect, compile, and covet gold, taking all they can find. At this point they've created an entire economy based on Gold, trading around towers of  it without an extra thought. 

A couple of different times I thought I had found Gold, perhaps enough to get me out of this tiny hole I live in. The one time it was actually a bunch of dyed wool on a dirt block. The other was on a pedestal surrounded by lava. They take pleasure in deceiving people like me. 

Do I like living in Achievement City? That's tough to answer. When the main group isn't there, it's tolerable. Nice land, beautiful scenery, and enough landmarks and monuments to last a lifetime (even a brand new Museum under downtown!). 

But when the group is there, it's hell. Their tyrannical nature is matched only by their chaotic actions. I've had the entrance to my house covered in lava. I've had to run as fast as I could from massive TNT explosions. I once suited up in all my armor to fight a creeper that I later realized was just a member of their group.

It's hell here. And yet, I wouldn't have it any other way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a huge amount of semi trucks that need to go from I-90 up North and vice-versa. As of right now they have two main routes. The first isn't awful, but also isn't ideal. That would be the route that takes them up Argonne and through Bigelow Gulch to where the NSC currently begins. 

The bigger problem is that a very large amount of trucks currently use Division St as a go-between I-90 and North. Because Division has so many traffic lights, these trucks are constantly idling in the middle of the city, and causing traffic problems overall.

I personally can't wait for it to get done. Let me know if you have any questions! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Apparently all of Funhaus blows the Founding Fathers to get write off on shows like Sex Swing and shit. Jon blows them too to get OTS and ETS. Don't forget the other members of LP.
And did Monty, Miles, Kerry, and Grey have to sleep with people to make stuff like RWBY or Camp Camp with the 2d team?

Did you just write a super-short fanfic? </TEXT>

<TEXT> They will slowly modify the traffic lights that you use on a daily basis, increasing the time of your usual commute and making sure you hit every red every day. They will install radio jammers, ensuring that the only station you can receive in your car is an AM foreign language station. They will adjust your speedometer to read five MPH faster than real speed, making sure you constantly are berated by other angry drivers. The will install a mosquito noise generator in your passenger head-rest, leading to the eventual break-up between you and your girlfriend.

And once all of this is done, they wait. A few days, a few weeks, who knows? Your temper shortens, you show up later and later to work. Your boss is forced to let you go. And this is when they make their final move.

Your dog. You've had him for seven years, and they know that. He's your rock, the one bright spot in a shitty life. And one day he is gone. He runs away, you presume. You wait for him to come back, one day, one week, one month. He's gone.

See, they don't need to kill you. You just needed the motivation to do it yourself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Contrary to what most of the comments in this thread say, I think Jack should stop being liberal in videos. In fact, I want him to go full-on Stephen Colbert style. He should give his Worms patriotic names. The only beer he should drink on camera is Bud Light. He should put a giant American Flag above his house in Achievement City!

Hell, speaking of Achievement City, Jack should build a wall around it! Don't let them damn foreigners in! Replace the giant doors with giant red-white-and-blue middle fingers! 

And I mean for people like the OP he can get really ridiculous. Build a massive rainbow, but have it lead into lava and fire. "Americanize" Gavin's house. Tear down Jeremy's house, because the public built it and that means Jeremy's house is a product of nasty socialism. 

Come on Jack, there's so many options to have fun with this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm confused how TOR would help? Regarding phones, Wikileaks says: 
These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the "smart" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.

Wouldn't the same issue apply to TOR? If they are in your computer they can see what you're typing anyways.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rooster Teeth new variety show in the works? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-07 04:10:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just thought this was interesting: I was browsing jobs on the Fullscreen site, and found [this](https://jobs.lever.co/fullscreen/a793775e-9bf9-4092-a598-f3373bb3b32e) listing. It's for a creative producer, *working for Rooster Teeth*, and says this specifically:

We are looking for a talented creative producer to join our team for a new short form comedy variety series. This daily series will live on the front page of Fullscreen's new video ap and provide social content for it's various other platforms. The ideal candidate will proven success in running digital shoots, strong writing skills, and thrive in a collaborative environment.

And one of the requirements:

Write/direct multiple videos throughout the week

So it makes me wonder what daily, funny show it could be. Maybe this is what The Patch is being retooled into? Or something new?

As an aside, how cool is it that Rooster Teeth offers both pet insurance and paid paternity time? </TEXT>

Spokane is cheaper to live in than FC, especially in terms of housing. I did a quick search on Zillow for both cities, and it seemed to confirm this conclusion.

Also on other benefit of living in Washington is no Income Tax (As of right now).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, that's a fair point. What I'm saying is that you said it in a passive-aggressive way that might "scare off" new users. A way to rephrase your answer might be something like:

"March 14th, also, you should know that questions like these get asked a lot, so next time using the search bar might be better."

I'm not trying to be a dick, and I understand why people are downvoting me. If you check my comment history, you'll realize I'm pretty damn addicted to this sub. And with that addiction I try to improve it all the time, while remaining nice and trying to act as an almost-ambassador to the RT brand, for any Redditors that are new or only casual viewers. 

So I apologize for calling you rude, I should have worded my first comment better. But in the future if I see stuff like this I'm still going to call it out, because I think I can slowly make this place more welcoming to new people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an aside, I looked at the property owners in the area on maps.spokanecity.org. Avista now owns both North corner lots at Sprague and Sheridan, and the large back lot at Riverside and Sheridan. Plus a couple smaller lots

In addition to Avista, the City of Spokane owns the land North of Riverside from Grant to Sheridan that butts up against the railroad tracks, so they will probably be able sale that land without any issues as well.

The only issue I may see them having is the private owners in the area. A couple of lots South of Riverside but North of Sprague are privately owned, so if they aren't willing to sale there may be a combo of new modern buildings and old run-down ones.  </TEXT>

I would imagine other companies may start signing on quick, especially while property prices in that area are still low. Due to our sprawl, Spokane doesn't usually have a chance at "urban renewal", so this is a nice difference.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be completely honest, that would be difficult, at least in the winter. Snow closes 195 all the time, whether it's wrecks or just blowing snow. So you take a 1.5 hour drive and make it 3 hours or so if it snows.

Spokane does have a satellite WSU campus, however, so maybe you can look into that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That makes sense. You guys get better, they get smarter. Kind of a back and forth. Yeah the only other thing I can think of is sort of like the system Reddit has. One of the subs I moderate had a problem with new accounts posting spam, so we put in a minimum amount of karma needed to post in the sub. Spam dropped dramatically, and we approve non-spam (but still low karma) manually.

I don't know if it would be possible, but maybe a way of verifying an account is a "good" account before letting the post appear in the community feed? Or something like that, I don't really know. I just like troubleshooting stuff like this.  </TEXT>

But at a minimum, give people a time-frame. I run Tech Support at a company that has about 10 different customers ask for help a day. Even if I'm slammed, I will email back the customer and let them know I'll help as soon as I have a chance, and when that might be. This helps keep the customer happy, even if it takes a long time for me to help them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so I know it's a bit taboo to criticize RT, and as a result this might get downvoted. But I think it's an important point. 

If you have paid attention to posts lately in this Sub, there's a reoccurring theme that pops up.  A lot of people seem to be having issues, either with the Store, their First Membership, or similar. And many of them say the same thing, that they email RT support and they don't get a response back, or the response doesn't help much.

https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/5srd92/need_help_with_first_membership_dont_upvote/

https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/5sl0qt/so_if_anyone_could_help_me_fix_my_first_membership/

https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/5rok0y/problem_ordering_a_squiggly_cup/

https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/5rj6i8/extremely_unhelpful_support/ (there is a comment complaining about not getting emails back too)

https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/5qkci1/unable_to_get_a_response_from_customer_support/

Now to their credit, they sometimes do a great job responding in the Reddit threads, which is great. But what about the customers that don't come on here as much? If they aren't getting responses to their emails then they are probably just being let out to dry.

I'm not trying to start an argument or even really chastise somebody. I just know that if people are paying decent money to RT for a subscription or merchandise that good support is usually expected. And I know I wouldn't want it to be an issue if it ever happens to me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry I can only answer the 1.5 question. Here is the Fire District map:

http://www.interceptradio.com/wiki/index.php/Spokane_County,_WA

Note that it's a bit outdated. Specifically I believe that Spokane City Fire now covers what on the map is marked District 10 - Station 2, and they are also airport backup. 

Edit: Correction. Here is the updated map:

https://www.spokanecounty.org/DocumentCenter/View/113

Looks like I was a bit wrong, as District 10 station 2 is still there, and SFD has a different station (6) near the airport.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So up in my neck of the woods it's icy and snowy right now. When I was driving into work this morning I watched a deer go full stupid. I seen them on the side of the road, kinda antsy and definitely wanting to cross the road so I sped up a bit and got past them.

But after I passed them, they decided they then wanted to cross, and started running. Somehow they didn't see the van on the other side of the road. The one made it across the road cleanly, but the other deer went full speed into the side of the van. I mean fast enough that there is probably a dent in the shape of a deer's head on that van now.

At this point I slowed down to make sure everything was okay, and I was just watching out my back window. The deer that hit the van tried to get up, but it really was icy outside. He promptly slid underneath the van he had just ran into full speed. So now the van was sitting there, and the deer was trying to kick himself out from underneath, while I'm sitting there crying because I'm laughing so hard.

Finally the deer gets himself out and bounds off into the woods. I really hope the other deer made fun of him, because it sure started my day off right.  </TEXT>

https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=ddB7do2jUx8C dat=19290726 printsec=frontpage hl=en

See the article about the fire at Glen Tana on the front page. 

Edit: Coincidentally, the grain silos in the top right part of the picture (to the left of St. Aloysius/Gonzaga) had a massive fire a few days after this photo was taken. It took the entire fire brigade to bring it under control.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I enjoy studying the history of Spokane, so I did a bit of research. First, I think the Hillyard yard (and township) is a bit to the right of the fire in this picture. This was also before the Kaiser plant was up. I did find a newspaper from December 1929, which mentioned how bad the wildfires were that year. So a wildfire would be my best guess. If I get a chance later I'll try to find some news stories about wildfires near Hillyard in 1929. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to what the other poster said, there is another issue with them not counting it towards data usage. In a way, it makes it much harder for potential competitors to establish themselves. 

Think of it this way: You have two streaming services (A and B) that are somewhat equal in what they offer for the user. However streaming service A doesn't count against your data usage, while streaming service B does count. So service B is at a disadvantage, and most people in that situation will choose service A moving forward. That's why people have an issue with it, as it makes it harder for new start-ups to gain an advantage.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so to explain more fully than the other comment, it started with Steve Hutchinson. He was on the Seahawks, and the Seahawks gave him a transition tag. What this means is that basically other teams could offer a contract to him, but the Seahawks had the right to match any contract and keep him.

So the Vikings, in order to "poison pill" the contract, wrote in that if Steve wasn't the highest paid lineman on the team, then his entire contract salary became guaranteed. The issue the Seahawks had with this is that at the time Walter Jones was still on the team, and just signed a massive contract. So the Seahawks literally couldn't pay for Hutch. 

In return, the Seahawks offered a contract to Nate Burleson, who at the time was tagged on the Vikings roster. In their contract, they offered to make his entire contract guaranteed if he played more than five games in a season in Minnesota, or if he made more than all the RBs on the team combined. Obviously Minnesota couldn't match this Both parts at the time), and this is where the feud came from.

The next time the CBA came up the poison pill was elimated.  </TEXT>

Second tip: Budget more than you think you will actually need. Stuff comes up.

Now for how much to actually budget, /u/beckymegan hit it on the head. Beyond the fixed costs, if you have $100 a day to spend you should be absolutely golden. (Depending on how much merch you want)

Just a note, I've never actually been to RTX. This is just from my business travel, but they should be pretty similar. $50 a day for food is how much most companies budget for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They came out with three easy to get into shows in the last year, and they are all great by my opinion.

For a funny "tv-style" show, watch Crunch Time.

For a great Sci-Fi show, watch Day 5. 

For a potty-mouth cartoon, check out Camp Camp. 

Now besides those three shows, there's tons of other content. Like the other poster said, definitely check out Theater Mode if you're into shitty movies. It's pretty funny. 

And because you like Cow Chop, make sure you check out Funhaus. Especially since we will almost certainly be seeing a crossover between the groups when CC moves to L.A. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Some Minecraft Let's Plays I've thought of, both rehashes and new. What are yours? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-13 18:51:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here are some different Minecraft Let's Plays I have thought of that might be cool to see them play. I know doing it week-in and week-out might get difficult, so these are just some ideas I enjoyed thinking of. If you have any of your own post them in the comments!

I know these are supposed to be posted in the weekly thread, but I don't see that coming up anymore. :(

---

**Flip This House X**

Simple one - Pick a day that Jack is out of town, and literally flip his house. Have the top of his head touching the ground, and have a ladder up to the upside-down house at the top.

---
**Hide and Seek**

Non-Acheivement City. Need a map with a large island that they can play on. The island should absolutely covered in trees, a super thick forest. The main goal of this game is to be the first to collect ten gold nuggets from chests spread throughout the forest. The entire game takes place at night, with day/night cycle turned off.

The hide and seek portion of this is that one person starts as a seeker. Every person is armed with a bow and arrows, but only the current seeker can use theirs. When they shoot a person, that person is now "it", and the previous seeker gets one minute to get away. The seeker is not allowed to open chest, so the only way they have a chance of winning is tagging someone else.

Some of the chests around the map will contain powerups instead of nuggets, like potions of speed, jump and night vision.

---

**The Tri-Wizard Tournament**

Recreating the Harry Potter Tri-Wizard Tournament, except instead of a big Goblet the final goal is to mine the Tower of Pimps.

The first task emulates the dragon task in Harry Potter. A large Obsidian Pit is made, with viewing areas on the side. One side of the pit is the entrance, the other side has a small raised area with a chest. Between the two sides is a Wither. The chest contains some regular apples, plus one golden apple (Withers love apples). Lowest time to steal the Golden Apple wins.

To mix it up a bit, and make it more like the Harry Potter Experience, each contestant will draw before the match to choose the Wither's assistants. This will be something like three skeltons, three creepers, three zombies, or something else. Just something to make that much harder.

The second task is the lake task. There will be a large lake, and the bottom will be covered in chests. For each contestant, one single chest will hold a block of wool that is their assigned color. They need to find that block and bring it to the surface. Once again lowest time wins.

The final third task will of course be the maze. The person with the best time of the first two tasks goes first, and so on. They will be armed with an iron sword and a diamond pickax. The maze should be dark and full of terrors - like zombies and spiders. First to find the Tower of Pimps and the center, mine it, and bring it to the judge on the outside is the winner. 

If you die you have to restart from the outside. 

---

**Achievement City Beautification Project**

Another simple one: Just a beautification project for Achievement city. Each person could pick a project. Somebody could add flowers to their favorite areas. Another could make fireworks trigger on the Achievement City Railroad. They could even build a piano using pressure plates and music boxes, and reenact *Big*. Just small stuff like that.

---

**Settlers of Catan**

If you played the game, you can see how this would work petty quickly. Just build a game board, and Matt or whoever runs it can distribute resources as needed. 

---

**Murder**

Just a note, this is one I suggested previously in the game suggestions thread.

Will recommend again: Murder (Like the G-Mod one), in Minecraft. Set-up a map, and have Matt be the game-master. Each person starts in their own room, and in that room there is a chest. The chest can be accessed from the outside by Matt as well.

Before the game starts, Matt places an item in each chest. Assuming six people are playing, four get nothing, one gets an enchanted bow with a few arrows, plus a jack-o-lantern, and one gets an enchanted sword.

It will play just like murder, with hidden clues around the map they try to collect to get a new bow. If the person with the bow kills the wrong person, Matt throws a potion of slowness at them and they have to put on the jack-o-lantern head.

There are other rules they can put in place too, like the murderer must drop the bow if they pick it up. I'm not sure how well this would all work, but I would love to see it tested.

---

Let me know if you have any suggested improvements!

<TEXT> That's true, and kind of what I had a feeling may happen. It's unfortunate, but this subs really seems to be one of the most toxic subs I've been in, and I think it really is a reason the sub isn't growing. 

I remember the sub was posted in an Ask-Reddit thread, and a user from there came into the FAQ thread and asked what Rooster Teeth was all about. He got down-voted. I guarantee that turned him off of Rooster Teeth as a whole. 

One other suggestion I have for you guys to potentially organize is mini-AMAs. Maybe try to talk to Miles or Luna and have some of the animators come in and do a sub-only AMA, or the prop crew, or the production crew, etc. 

My second suggestion is a bit more out there, but may work. In the past I seen somebody wishing they had First to watch some stuff they missed. I was in a decent spot financially, so I asked them their site name and bought them 6 months. I would love to see more of this, Random Acts of RT or something like that. I've also done similar with RT Store gift certificates.

A third is just to really enforce a "Don't be a dick" rule. A lot of time somebody will post an (admittedly dumb) question. The only comment might be something like "Google it" or "Just search the sub." While these are valid answers, people seem to forget that a lot of the time the person who asked the question isn't just looking for an answer, they are looking for a discussion. The quick downvote and snarky answer just drives them away from the sub.

I have no idea what middle ground you would need to improve the sub, but these are just my suggestions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate to say it, but if you actually want to see growth and more subscribers in 2017 you may have to allow/encourage shitposts. I mean, /r/Funhaus has 70,000 less subscribers, but compare the top posts in the last month and you can tall they are hitting /r/all quite a bit more.

https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/top/?sort=top t=month

https://www.reddit.com/r/funhaus/top/?sort=top t=month

Hell look at another production company like H3H3 and you'll see what I mean:

https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/top/?sort=top t=month

They have less subscribers but far more upvotes!

Now I know the mods don't actually remove shitposts or anything like that, but I think I nailed down part of the problem. I think you guys might want to consider using CSS and removing the downvote button. Obviously this is only a partial fix, but the honest truth is a small group on people on the new queue can completely control the flow of this entire subreddit. 

I'm sure some people may not like this, but there would still be ways to downvote if you really wanted to. Furthermore, I think this will encourage people to posts here. As a mod of a couple of other subreddits (none super big, mind you), this is an incredibly intimidating sub to posts in because it seems like it's difficult to succeed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretend you want to build a lego house to model a real house, and need to know where you should put the little 2x2 blocks to make support columns. But you don't like straight up and down columns, you like cool diagonal ones. 

So first you build the floors out of lego, with no walls or anything connecting them together, and get ready to build your model. You take the bottom floor, turn it upside down, and place it on the ceiling. you then attach strings to that bottom floor, and now hang the second floor (Also upside down), off of the first floor attached to the ceiling. You make your string go at weird angles and lengths, until the second floor is completely level with the first floor attached to the ceiling.

He then repeated it with the third floor and so-on, until he had all his floors level. At that point he would take the strings off, disconnecting all of the floors. He would then reconstruct it using something hard, like 2x2 Legos, placing these support legos exactly where the strings had been, but this time constructing it the right way up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So with the shoveling rule it's honestly barely enforced. The only time I really seen them go after it was back in 08 I think when we had tons of snow and kid's were walking in the streets to get to bus-stops instead of using sidewalks. That being said, maybe just shovel every 6" or so, to save your back some work and avoid a build-up of ice underneath. Then shovel what's leftover at the end.

This snow event looks to be a prolonged one, so maybe just shovel every morning is your other option.

For the parking issue, I would still follow it if you live on a semi straight street. If we hit stage 2 they are almost guaranteed to plow it at some point. I've seen them do every cul-de-sac in my neighborhood. This big reason you want to follow it is because the plows will probably just block in your car if you don't, and plowed snow is a bitch to remove.

FYI, a big one is make sure you keep the fire hydrant clear of snow! I feel like they would write a ticket for that much quicker than they would the sidewalk rule.

Let me know if you have any other questions! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really dumb question, so I guess this is the right place to ask.

I got an email today form my Student Loan financier, going over the interest and how it applies to my taxes. One thing that confused me is this:

**What's included in your number?** The interest on payments received between January 1, 2016 and 5:00 p.m. Central time on December 30, 2016. 

So my question is: Why is December 31st not included? Is the interest I pay on that date just not applied to my taxes at all? I know it's small, it just seems interesting to me that they don't include it.  </TEXT>

I like their deli, and Fatburger can give you a great burger. Hell it's even good to just go in, play some Keno, and get a $3.50 German Sausage delivered to you. There are quite a few different options. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Turns out smaller businesses do better when the markplace has consumers with increased purchasing power.

I live in Washington. I go to a small general/grocery store that primarily caters to farmers and ranchers, staffed almost entirely by high school students making minimum wage. Now the states has voted in a large minimum wage increase, and the store will have to pay these workers more.

But here is the issue, the farmers and ranchers won't have increased purchasing power, as they still have to compete with ranchers and farmers from Montana, Idaho, and other Western states. So where will the money come from? 

The store itself will be forced to do something to account for these extra wages. Whether it's laying off some of these high school workers, cutting hours, or raising prices on products. As far as I can see any solution is a bad one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> French said the Clean Air Agency has been wrestling with this issue for months, but the ordinance was never added to the commissioners agenda. Instead, it was raised as a miscellaneous item during Tuesdays meeting, a move that doesnt appear to violate Washingtons Open Public Meetings Act.

There comes a time when its the right time to bring something forward, French said, adding that he didnt want to cause an uproar before testing out the ordinance. You dont want to advertise these things before they even take effect.

This really annoys me. They knew this would cause issues and debate, so they purposely didn't cover it as an issue until they already allowed it. I don't think these "miscellaneous items" should be allowed, or at least should be curtailed. 

The policy came as a surprise to Crystal Oliver, who advocates for laws that are friendly to pot farmers and recently served on the Clean Air Agency Marijuana Advisory Committee.

I did not see it on the agenda or I would have been there, she said, referring to the commissioners meeting, which had no audience other than a Spokesman-Review reporter.

This seems very shady by Al French. It sounds like they literally waited until nobody was at the meeting to bring up issues with the proposal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me tell you this-- /r/Drama is one of the most malevolent, cruel, coldhearted online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that Reddit would allow such a vile, festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist. You think [slur]town was bad? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans "n[slur]"), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. That's intentional. They encourage arguments in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that /r/drama may be producing an entire army of Dylann Roofs and Elliot Rogers, and I highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit, lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura.

<TEXT> FYI, smoking weed in public isn't allowed in Washington. However, they do have these new disposable vapor pens. They are about the size of a cigarette, and will offer a quick hit of "special" vapor. When you get here, I would give a few places a call (you have so many stores to choose from) and see if they have it. It may be the best discrete way of getting high, beside edibles of course.

Also if you're new to smoking, let the people at the dispensary know that. Every dispensary I have gone to is full of super nice people, and they honestly love to help and teach newbies.

Now after you do it, make sure you don't use too much, and enjoy the hell out of our city. Downtown Spokane can be beautiful in the Winter, and visiting a dispensary beforehand will make it even more special. 

Also check out the Spokane Comedy Club, and see who is on tap when you come. You might get lucky and get a great comedian.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everybody. One question that seems to pop up a lot in the sub, and I believe on the website, is from new fans wanting to know where to start. Rooster Teeth has been around for a good chunk of time, and there is so much content to wade through that it can be a bit daunting for the new fans. I would like to make it a bit simpler, and have an easy reference to give to new fans. Eventually I would like to see it go under the Wiki on the sub if possible.

So although I know a lot of videos, I also know that the best way to compile a large list like this is to crowd-source. I think the best way to do this is to come up with categories, and go form there. Here is what I'm thinking of so far:

First and Foremost, the funniest moments in RT history. Headlight fluid, facility tours, WWE intros, Cheesemaster, etc.

Next would be the "inside jokes." First ever Tower of Pimps, People Like Grapes, Mark Nutt, and probably some others that don't just involve Gavin.

After that would be "intro" videos, basically videos where you get to see what all of RT are like. Would include 

So with all of these I need help finding videos to add to all of these categories, and also any categories you think would be useful to add. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a side idea. I would love that if you donate a certain amount you could play a match or two with the people gaming on the side. For example if I donate $50 I could play a match of Rocket League (my personal fav game) with whoever is on the couch at the time. Then again they would probably get overloaded, but it might be fun!

Maybe they could just bring in animators, etc and have them play with mics on, so fans could talk to at least some people from the company. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the issue I see with it. While it's probably great for Seattle, it sucks for small towns, especially in Eastern Washington. I go to a small town North of Spokane and shop at a small general/grocery store there. Every worker in that place is high school age, making minimum wage. However the shoppers there are generally the farmers from the surrounding areas.

The farmers won't be making more money after this law, beef and crop prices are probably going to remain stable as to compete with other states. So where in the world will this general store get the money to increase pay to all these workers? It's almost certain they will have to let some go, as I know the owners don't make a huge amount of money. It's tight margins, and if they try to raise prices their main customers literally won't have the money to purchase anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not completely. What this means is that when you vote for president you are trying to get your state to swing a certain way. If 51% of Hawaiian residents vote red, and 49% vote blue, the state's delegates will then vote for the red candidate. 

Now what actually happens is that states get entrenched in who they vote for. There could be a state that votes blue in every election, and the result is 75% blue and 25% red. In that case if you are a red voter in that state, your vote is kind of obsolete.

Theoretically, the number of delegates should line up cleanly with the number of voters in that state, but that isn't always the case. So you have situations where a candidate can win the popular vote, but lose because they didn't get enough delegates.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's improved a lot, to be honest, mostly because of the new principal. In eight years, Roger's graduation rate has increased [more than 30%.](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/dec/12/spokane-high-school-graduation-rates-hit-83/). Furthermore, last year their football team made playoffs for the [first time in 39 years](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/oct/30/rogers-reaches-postseason-for-first-time-as-gsl-me/).

The overall improvement at Rogers has been astounding, and it's honestly one of the things I wish more of Spokane realized. The Spokesman Review had a great article a couple of years ago on what they have done. 

http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/feb/27/achievement-pride-soar-at-spokanes-rogers-high/

Among the highlights:

Math scores improved dramatically at Rogers, from 21 percent passing in 2010 to 74 percent in 2013; 

That's seriously an insane gain. Nothing against you personally, it just seems like a lot of Spokane has similar views on Rogers and it's one of the biggest obstacles they still need to get over.

<TEXT> Will recommend again: Murder (Like the G-Mod one), in Minecraft. Set-up a map, and have Matt be the game-master. Each person starts in their own room, and in that room there is a chest. The chest can be accessed from the outside by Matt as well.

Before the game starts, Matt places an item in each chest. Assuming six people are playing, four get ~~placeholder items~~ nothing (thanks /u/Axlgrape), one gets an enchanted bow with a few arrows, plus a jack-o-lantern, and one gets an enchanted sword.

It will play just like murder, with hidden clues around the map they try to collect to get a new bow. If the person with the bow kills the wrong person, Matt throws a potion of slowness at them and they have to put on the jack-o-lantern head.

There are other rules they can put in place too, like the murderer must drop the bow if they pick it up. I'm not sure how well this would all work, but I would love to see it tested. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry man, it might be your style, but this sub has assholes that downvote more than any other sub I've seen. So basically Rooster Teeth is a production company from Austin, TX. They were first popularized with their Halo webseries Red Vs Blue. At this point they are big, and have a ton of different content to enjoy.

Let me know what you're into in other entertainment and I can potentially recommend something to watch. Comedy, drama, anime? Do you like watching people play games, DnD, Xbox, PC gaming, etc. Let me know and I'll help you out, and hopefully change opinions on this sub which can be shitty at times.

Edit: /u/sadlyf420 this goes for you too. I'll help you out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can I ask an honest question? Is the RT website better than this sub? I come here everyday, but this sub just doesn't have the discussion, or even friendliness, that other subs do. Hell, even shitposts don't do well here. 

I know I'm complaining, but it just kind of sucks because I feel like this sub could be better, there's just something stopping it and I can't place my finger on it. I mean, looks at /r/cowchop. They have around one-tenth the subscribers, but any given front page post has probably a similar-ish number of comments. 

Knowing this sub, I'm pretty sure I'll get downvoted for this comment, and I really don't care, but I hope it spawns at least a bit of discussion. </TEXT>

However if you know of some cool stuff, I would be happy to go and explore and see it. It just seems to me like every tourist attraction in Spokane can be seen in a different flavor in every other big city in the country. 

I will admit we score high marks on the outdoorsy aspect. That's probably Spokane's best feature.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to a magician when I was 8. He brought me up on stage while his assistant rolled out a large red curtain on what looked to be a portable coat hanger. He said some magical words, I was pulled below stage by another assistant, and all of a sudden I didn't like magic anymore. It was ruined.

From that day on, I also hated audience participation. Try to bring me on stage to be hypnotized? Nah. An interactive Broadway show? Count me out. 

I tried to go up on stage once in middle school, but I had a nervous breakdown and ended up punching the drama teacher in the eye. At least I think that's what happened; I suppressed the whole thing. I think that's why the man with the eye-patch was so surprised when he demanded I get up from my chair. 

"Arrr! Stand up lest ye be executed!"

I held firm. 

"No thanks buddy. Not into that sort of thing."

My cruise had been incredible so far. The first day I had won $150 on the on-board casino. The second day I was able to lounge about at the adult-only pool, drinking Mai-Tai's to my heart's content. But the third day... The third day is where it fell apart. 

---

My wife woke me on the third day with her *lovely* wake up call.

"Honey! Honey! Look at this! It says there is a brand new show today, a pirate show!"

I groaned. But her look made it very clear we were going.

It wasn't all bad. It started out with the cruise director on stage, giving a brief introduction on the group. "Professional pirates" he called them. I was never really interested in pirates, so I was already bored. At least I was until one of the pirates ran out on stage. 

I would best describe him as short, stubby, and stupid. I mean I didn't know if he was stupid, but he looked like it. A bit cross-eyed, with a brown vest and puffy trousers. But out of the folds between his shirt and pants appeared a sword in his hands, shiny and well-kept by the looks of it. 

He bounded across the stage, and with one quick motion he sliced towards the directors throat. Blood began spurting out, a miniature red geyser. I have to admit I was a bit impressed at this point. The special effects were far beyond what I would expect from a cruise ship stage show.

To add to it, I heard faint screams coming from behind me. The surround sound seemed to be on point as well. But my fascination turned to horror, as I saw more and more pirates spill out from behind the stage curtains, and immediately run down the stairs into the crowd.

I pulled on my wife's blouse.

"Honey, let's go. I don't want any part of it."

She gave a loud laugh.

"Relax! None of this is real! Just enjoy it!"

I pulled her arm again.

"We need to go *now*. They're going to bring me up on stage, I just know it! And then all the special effects will be ruined and I won't be able to enjoy my cruise anymore!"

I was beginning to break down a bit, I could feel it. The priates were working their way through the crowd, forcing each male up towards the stage, and tying them up as they got there. 

Before my wife could chastise me for my immature rambling, I felt cold metal on the back of my neck. I turned, and was face-to-face with a pirate. An eye-patch on his left, part of his ear missing on the right, and a beard to make Grizzly Adams jealous. 

"Arrr! Stand up lest ye be executed!"

I held firm.

"No thanks buddy. Not into that sort of thing."

He turned his blade, pointing the sharp end at my jugular, making his intentions clear. But I wasn't into audience participation, and I intended to make *that* clear. 

I grabbed the blade, pinching it between my finger and thumb. 

"I am absolutely *not* going up on that stage, and you will not force me to do so!"

With my free hand I shoved the pirate against the wall and began to walk back up the path to the doors. But before I made it, I heard a loud scream. It was unmistakably my wife's voice. I turned, and the bastard of a pirate had his blade to my wife's neck.

"Get on the stage or ye lass' gets it!"


I saw red. 

---

I don't remember what happened next. At some point I realized these were less fake-pirates, and more fake-fake-pirates. I'm not sure how it happened, but the first coast guard member I talked to believed I set a record for most modern day kills with a sword. 

Beyond the talk-shows, presidential visits, and key to the city, our life went back to normal. I kept the sword, it's on the mantle above my fireplace. It serves as reminder, to both my wife and any visitors we get:

I really hate audience participation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! I'm at work so I haven't had a chance to really study the statistics, but looking at it I know I can come up with something. There seem to be a lot of really interesting trends from year to year.

Based on what I've collected so far my plan is to maybe average out how many of each type of player is above the standard deviation. So for example, if my league averages 5 QBs above, 9 RBs above, and 12 WRs above, if 6 or 7 QBs are gone and 10 RBs are gone, I should probably go for a WR, or something like that. I just need to refine it before my draft.

It also shows me how valuable some players can be, and leads me to possibly reaching. As an example, When I averaged kicker points in my league for the top 12 (12 team league), Gostkowski is so far ahead of the other kickers it's kind of crazy. 

In the past two years, only two kickers each year were above one standard deviation. In each of those years, he was not only above the deviation, he was above two standard deviations. I really think the stats can be useful. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Using statistics from previous years, how can I best come up with a draft flow chart? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-25 16:18:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I currently have data for the last 5 years in my league, including pts scored for every player, how they rank up against other players in the same position, and what their overall rank is in the league. 

I've taken all of these stats and exported them into a spreadsheet. I've found some trends in this data already. One is that, because of our scoring rules, there is generally about 4 QBs that are a cut above every other player, and other trends like that.

So my actual question is a general one for anybody who has data like this. How can I use the data to create a loose draft guide? I was thinking about averaging each set for a position, then getting the standard deviation and seeing how many std devs away a certain group of players may be. Like the 4 QBs that are a cut above the rest are all more than 1 std dev away from average.

My goal is to create a sort of flow chart I could use during the draft to give me general guidelines. This would be really useful because I'm usually not at full state of mind during the draft, and having easy to use flowcharts would be great. If you have any ideas please let me know, and I'll try them out. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, that link was just the best summary I could find for Firestorm itself. I'll be honest, my assumption was based on what I heard from my cousins that were firefighters near Chewelah. They mentioned how many dead trees there were in the forest, and how difficult it made it to fight.

However, after researching a bit more I think the dead trees may have been caused by the whole issue of letting wildfires burn vs. immediately putting them out.

Also, 20 acres on Tower Mountain sounds incredible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our first regular season overtime game. Boykin walks out on to the field, nervous. He know's he can do this. He's practiced 1,327 times at home, all for this one single moment. He can barely hear the referee. The coin flies into the air.

He freezes up. He can't say a word. Time is slowing, the coin barely moving, right at the top of it's arc. All of a sudden, he hears a quiet voice breaking through the crowd noise. ^^^"Use ^^^the ^^^force..."

He can barely make out what the voice said. He looks around, straining to hear it. ^"Use ^the ^force, ^Trevone!" Finally, he spots him. In the crowd, standing between thousands of people, is the GOAT. The greatest coin flipper of all time, Tavaris Jackson, is looking down on Boykin and helping him!

"Dammit Boykin, use the force!" T-Jack yells. Boykin focuses his attention back on the coin. It's at eye-level now. 

"Heads"

Time speeds up again. The coin hits the ground. Boykin strains to see the result. "Heads, Seahawks have won the toss." Boykin is ecstatic, he looks up to the crowd to give T-Jack a thumbs up. But T-Jack is gone, nowhere near where he was previously standing. Boykin searches, but just can't find him in the crowd. 

There's no more time to search, the referee is demanding his answer. "We'll receive." The Seahawks get the ball, and Russell Wilson marches it down the field to win the game. But Boykin wasn't paying attention. He was searching the crowd, for one more glimpse of the greatest. But he couldn't find him. He gave up, and went to celebrate with his team.

---

Later that night, Boykin received a text message. He checked the sender. "Unknown number". The message was short, and to the point. "In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. The force will be with you, always. Use it for good, and Go Seahawks." </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm in a couple of very touchdown-heavy leagues. 6 pts up to 12pts, depending on length of TD, while they only get two pts every 50 yards for non QB. Can anybody name some sleepers for a league like this? Basically, I don't care if a player only gets 4 runs/passes and 10 yards, if two of those runs/passes are TDs I'm happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found out this week that RT owns http://fun.haus. This just makes me so happy and I don't know why.

Also, I need some help in my fantasy football league. I bought a funny website domain, and am trying to prank everybody in my league. My website is going to have links to different pages, every page for different team owners I go up against. So far my plan is to have a picture of them engaged in some sort of X-Rated activity with their first pick in the fantasy draft.

I would like to put more on each page however, but I'm drawing a blank on what to do. Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> To me, I see it as very likely. Despite Spokane being a Republican stronghold, our city government is very liberal. Condon, being a Republican, will have to go through a recall vote very soon is my prediction. They will get the signatures within a week or two.

After that, we will see Stuckart as our temporary mayor. I'm kind of against this overall. I think Condon, despite being dumb with situations like this, struck a good balance to the city council. They have good intentions, but really lack foresight sometimes, the latest being this fine on railroads they rescinded.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Google Search Operator Help - Dates </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-12 19:52:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to get help with Search operators in Google Search, specifically here is my issue:

I like to search the Google Newspaper Archive for different items. I'll use Reddit as an example:

https://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+site:news.google.com%2Fnewspapers

When searching a newspaper archive, dates are really important. If you look at the first response, you'll notice that it is from 1930, at least on my search. However if I use search tools and set a custom range of 1929-1931, nothing comes up.

What I did notice is that the URL of every story has the date embedded in it. The 1930 story, for example, includes " dat=19300426". 

I would like to be able to search for these dates in a URL while searching the archive. Is there a search operator where I have only 1920's stories come up, by somehow searching "dat=192"? Every time I try something, I think the "=" screws it up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem! /r/gameofthrones and many similar subreddits use Spoiler tags a lot. /r/riddles uses it in the comments as well. 

My idea is that you could flair a post, like "First Spoiler" or something like that. The CSS could then hide the posts, and you have to mouseover to see what it actually says. Or at a minimum have it flaired First Spoiler so I know not to click it, and disallow any posts that have spoilers in the title.

Honestly it might not be worth it in this sub, but it should be reasonably simple to implement. There's quite a few tutorials on how to do it around the site.

<TEXT> /u/beckymegan is smart and told us to post ideas here, so here are some of my Minecraft ideas:

 - Minecraft Prop Hunt on PC

 - Roller Coaster Competition
 
 As judged by Geoff

 - Fight or Flight

 A large maze-like path in the sky, no walls. The path is usually one block wide. Each person is given an iron sword. At certain points in the path it leads to a larger platform with skeletons caged in, and maybe a creeper to make it more difficult. You basically have to make it to the end of the course without being knocked off by arrows from the skeletons.

 - Minecraft Murder

 They create an area above or below ground, as the level they will play on. Matt runs the competition. There are six rooms at the side of level, with a chest in each. The chest should also be accessible from a corridor behind the rooms, so Matt can open each one.

 Each player goes into their room, and Matt starts stocking the chests. One player is given a diamond sword, another gets an enchanted bow and arrows, and the rest get nothing.

 Plays just like Murder in Gmod. If the person with the bow kills the wrong person, Matt throws a potion of slowness at them. They key is that each person must disable death messages except for Matt. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-08-12 16:28:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Something I noticed lately is that people like to create threads about videos that haven't actually been released to the public on Youtube yet. I don't mind it if it stays in the comments on the RT First video post, but lately people have been posting separate threads with info on the videos. I had part of last week's Minecraft spoiled for me because of posts. :(

Obviously an easy solution is to just become a First member. But I already am, I just like watching Minecraft on Friday, not Thursday.

My proposal is to simply have spoiler tags for posts that come out between when a First video is released, and when it shows up on Youtube. I'm even willing to write the CSS to make it work if it comes to it, I just think it would help the sub to have a way to hide posts like that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard a discussion about this subject. Basically, think about the type of fans that Rooster Teeth (And associated streamers) probably have. These kids spent their whole time in high school and college watching RT, and now some of them have graduated. 

They are probably in a field like Engineering or Computer Science, and at this point make way more than they need to spend on necessities. So they end up having a lot of disposable income, and RT is somewhere they can spend it with little guilt. Of course this isn't unique to RT, but they fit into the model. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was driving to work this morning and had to stop for a chicken crossing the road.

It wasn't as funny as I had hoped.

---

Also, I always smile when I come into work, because there is a cute little birds nest at eye level in a tree near our door. Except then I realize that whenever I walk by the nest the mom takes off and leaves her babies for me. What an awful parent.

If different Youtube groups held a draft, in which personalities from one group could become free agents and enter into the draft, who would you hope AH, FH, and the others would pick up?

I mean, Gavin would be a goner. Once he became a free agent there is no way RT could compete with PewDiePie money. I'm sure his entire job would consist of recording facial expressions in Slow-Mo. But then again the merchandising for that deal would be excellent. Team Weird Accent or something.

<TEXT> It's an inside joke. It all started back in 1983, when Reading Rainbow came onto the air for the first time. As you probably know, Mica's dad LeVar was the host of Reading Rainbow throughout it's run. One aspect of the show that was a constant was the ending.

You may remember what LeVar said at the end: "I'll see you next time." With this phrase, he always looked at the same camera, specifically **Camera 3**. 

When LeVar moved to do Star Trek, he found Camera 3 for the main Enterprise Bridge set. He placed a small rainbow on top of the camera, as a small joke and to honor his other show.

I bet even to this day, Mica still puts a little rainbow on her cameras, and calls them Camera 3, just to honor her dad.

<TEXT> My completely unsubstantiated theory is that there is some crazy deals going on behind closed doors (obviously). Specifically, I think Wikileaks and Trump have a deal where Trump has agreed to pardon Snowden if he becomes President, in return for info on Hillary and the DNC.

Wikileaks and Russia's deal has to be in some part due to Snowden's asylum. I have a strong feeling e told them quite a bit about American Intelligence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I think I found the issue. When you call javascript on a page like this, every link should be https. It looks like they forgot one of these, specifically:

div id="marketing-banner"/div
script type="text/babel" src="http://roosterteeth.com/scripts/react/components/banner.js"/script
                div class="hero-copy"
        h1Sign up for DOUBLE GOLD Membership/h1
    /div

So I believe if they change this they would be okay and not pop up the warning anymore.

However on the security end the TLS connection is good, so I think you would be fine, especially since Google Chrome blocks the js by default. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's because every channel is different, based on their viewers and how tech-savvy they are. If there is a channel that is primarily aimed at older folks, they will probably have less views, but more money per view as older people don't use ad-blocker as much. On the other-hand, a channel like The Know would get more views and less money per view due to the users being more likely to block ads.

There's also geographical issues. A viewer in Britain might get served a different ad than a viewer in the US. Assuming both click on the ad, the British click might be worth more than the US click.

I think $2/1000 views is a good ballpark for channels like AH and similar. If you look at the the AH channel, you can average it out to about a video a day at 150 thousand views. For comparison, PewDiePie does a video a day at about 3 to 4 million views.

The Lets Play channel may be a bit different, as it has longer videos on average. So they may get quite a bit more. However all of this isn't enough to support a company like RT. They, like almost every other big Youtuber, sell merchandise in order to make a good chunk of money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's for the full service, if you're using a data-only SIM card this is what they say it works with:

Devices verified as compatible.
Here's a list of devices that weve verified will work with Project Fi:

Nexus 7 - K009 (2013 US LTE)

Nexus 9 - 0P82300 (2014 US LTE)

iPad Air 2 - Model A1567 (2014)

iPad Mini 4 - Model A1550 (2015)

iPad Pro - Model A1652 (2015)

Galaxy Tab S - Model SM-T807V (2015)

Nexus 5X (North American version)

Nexus 6 (North American version)

Nexus 6P (North American version)

Other devices

Data-only SIMs may work with devices that arent on our list. Devices need to be unlocked and work with T-Mobile (GSM radio). You can order a data-only SIM and test it out. However, we may not be able to help activate or troubleshoot these other devices.

Note on phones: If you set up a data-only SIM with a phone, you will have access to data, but you wont be able to make calls and texts across the cellular network.

So sorta what you were looking for. Side note, Google Fi is awesome and I love it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you go into Day 5 expecting it to be Game of Thrones, you'll be disappointed. If you go into the show realizing it's a Rooster Teeth production, you'll be blown away.

On the other point, hearing about it non-stop, I'm assuming there is a big reason for that. While Rooster Teeth has been doing great as an internet production company, it is obvious they want now bridge the gap between where they currently are and being a traditional production company. 

This means that they are marketing these TV Shows and documentaries more than other productions. They are no longer just advertising to fans, they are advertising to non-fans and distributors as well.

The result of this is a minor annoyance to huge fans, but an expanded audience, which is great for the company. I'm sure they would never want to annoy fans like yourself, but it's a bit of a necessary evil to keep growing and achieving their goals.

Also, to be honest, Day 5 is good enough they deserve to talk about it. </TEXT>

Specifically:

Under Washington law, there is a strong presumption against finding that state law preempts local ordinances. Although Initiative 502 establishes a licensing and regulatory system for marijuana producers, processors, and retailers in Washington State, it includes no clear indication that it was intended to preempt local authority to regulate such businesses. We therefore conclude that I-502 left in place the normal powers of local governments to regulate within their jurisdictions, he said in a news release. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does city code still officially ban the sale of marijuana related items? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-19 16:48:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For clarification, I am not against pot or anything. Honestly just curious.

I was just reading some of the city codes today, and I noticed a section that was not yet repealed. Here is the link to the code in question: https://my.spokanecity.org/smc/?Chapter=10.15A

And here is some of the text that confuses me:

"Drug paraphernalia" means, but is not limited to:

any item, whether useful for non drug related purposes or not, which is displayed, grouped with other items, advertised, or promoted in a manner to reasonably suggest its usefulness in the growing, harvesting, processing, manufacturing, preserving, inhaling, injecting or ingesting of marijuana, hashish, hashish oil, cocaine, methamphetamine or any controlled substance;

And:

any objects used, intended for use or primarily designed for use in ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing marijuana, hashish, hashish oil, cocaine, methamphetamine or any controlled substance into the human body, such as:

So then in another section there is this:


It is unlawful for any person to sell, give or permit to be sold or given, any drug paraphernalia in any form.

So my questions is how are these laws still in effect if it is otherwise legal to sell all of this in Spokane?

Also, fun fact: [It is illegal in Spokane to: ask for or receive compensation, gratuity or reward for practicing fortunetelling, palmistry or clairvoyance;](https://my.spokanecity.org/smc/?Section=10.19.020)

Edit: It does not that there is an exception for people with prescriptions, but no recreational exception that I can see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so just think about Gendry, and how much we miss him, right? I figure he will make a reappearance in season 7, and end up pledging himself somehow to Dany. Maybe he learned how to forge Valyrian steel or something like that. In return for this, I think once Dany is queen, she will legitimize him as a Baratheon, in exchange for him pledging his support to her, and he will take control of the Stormlands.

If this happens it will be a neat little way to tie-up his story line, and give him a bit of a reward for rowing a boat for over three seasons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A really simple explanation is due to convection. So basically the middle of a planet contains a bunch of super hot metals, iron, etc. In a planet like Earth, this is all super hot, but the material at near the crust is cooler than the material at the center. This causes the material to move, the hot material moves out towards the crust, the cool material in towards the center, creating a bit of a loop. This movement of metal is what causes the magnetic field itself.

In planets like Venus and Mars, the center has cooled to a more uniform temperature, so there is less movement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, all magnets are dipole. You will never have a magnet in which there's only positive, and no negative.

As for your other question, yes some planets do not have magnetic poles, like Venus and Mars. It depends on the interior of the planet, especially the temperature variation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is fun. So lets say you went back in time 6 years took up the offer of "SmokeTooMuch" in 2010 and bought 10,000 bitcoins for $50. And because you can tell the future, you sell right before they hit 1250 (Probably triggering the bubble collapse by yourself.) Sweet! You now have 12.5 million dollars! 

But you're a greedy asshole, aren't you? You want more. It is now November 2013, and you are going to play the stock market. You look at your pile of money, and think back to what you know from that one time you flipped on CNBC. I'm just going to assume you're stupid and only want to invest, not gamble.

You know that oil dropped a lot, but you don't know about investing so you go find an expert. You Google around and find a portfolio manager in your city. You schedule an appointment, stop at the bank, then head down to his office. You walk in, and drop a duffel-bag on his desk.

"Invest this."

He seems confused, and asks you to repeat yourself.

"This is 12.5 million dollars. Invest this."

His eyes widen for a split second, but he recovers. He's used to dealing with crazy millionaires, after all. 

"Okay sir, I can invest this for you. What are you interested in? We have some nice long-term bonds if you are looking, or maybe we can place it in some reliable oil shar-"

"No. No oil. In-fact, please stay away from oil. Actually, can I invest against oil? I want to do that."

His face looks incredulous.

"Sir, we have some very smart investment managers, and we all believe oil will be a steady for the foreseeab-"

"NO. Do not invest my money in oil."

He seems to be getting a bit annoyed, but then gives you a sickly-smile.

"Okay sir, it is your money after all. If you would like to short oil, we can do that? We can even get you a nice little loan to invest a bit more if you would like? This money you already have would be a nice down payment!"

"Whatever that means, do it."

He stares at you.

---

Just under a year later, you are sitting in an office. When oil dropped to $45 dollars a share, you dropped out and immediately payed off your previous loan. You also dropped by the investment office and left the nice man a greeting card.

The men across from you are old friends, you only just met them. You stare at them, and begin speaking.

"What are they paying?"

"Well we aren't really at the liberty to discuss that."

"Okay, I don't care. Whatever they offer, I will beat. Whatever benefits they give you, I will beat."

The men look at each other.

"We'll get back to you next week."

---

June 2016. You finally reached the timeframe you left from. You look at the name plaque on your desk. They stuck with tradition, and let you choose your own title. Underneath your name, it reads:

"Chief Awesomeness Officer and Immortal Time-Lord, Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC." </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not really a reference to RVB, but to the joke itself, which is old. However now you have sent me down a rabbit hole.

Know Your Meme lists the joke as starting in 2001 on a radio show, but I have found older references than that. [Here is a forum post from 1996](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.autos.makers.ford.mustang/rrmEo1okMGM) that makes the same joke. [And another from 1994.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.humor/zgYO9JD0aIg)

But we can go back even further than that! [Here is a write-in section from a newspaper](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=191 dat=19841129 id=KV5OAAAAIBAJ sjid=GS4DAAAAIBAJ pg=3770,3531287 hl=en) from 1986. If you look for the  Speak-Out that starts "I'M CALLING IN RESPONSE" you'll see that the blinker fluid joke was funny back then as well.

Sorry for the long response, but this was fun to research. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys. Just a quick little bug I experienced. Have any of you had anything like this?

I was doing matchmaking, searching through Hoops. I joined a game just like normal, however when I got into the game it was basically a custom game:

- Time stuck at 3:20
- Hockey puck instead of basketball
- Unlimited boost
- No gravity
- And quite a few more.

After about 30 seconds it kicked me and I didn't get a replay. But I thought it was really strange. Anybody see this ever? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Exploring Gavin's "The sky is bigger than the ground". The height at which that becomes true </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-06 21:53:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everybody that reads this. I just wanted to go into Gavin's statement on "The sky is bigger than the ground" and see if I can quantify it.

I just wanted to quickly go over how we could say that the sky is bigger than the ground, and I realized the best way is to compare the volume of the ground (Earth) against the volume of the sky (our atmosphere?). We can see at which height the volume of the air is more than the volume of the ground, and therefore at which height "The sky is bigger than the ground."

So here are some useful variables and valuables:

V^e is the volume of Earth, about 1.083E12 Km^3

V^a is the volume of the air

h is height.

r^e is the radius of the earth, about 6371km.

We can define V^a to be [(4/3)\*pi\*(h+r^e )^3 ]-[(4/3)\*pi\*(6371)^3 ]

We set this equal to V^e, to determine where they are equal. Above that point, the "sky" is bigger than the ground. After solving for these two, I found that h=1655km. So anywhere past 1655 km up from the surface is where the sky is bigger than the ground.

---

Of course Gavin could have just meant surface area. This is just a fun little bit of math to see the surface area at the surface of the Earth, vs a surface area at 35000ft, about the height airplanes fly at. 

r^e = 3959 miles

r^sky = 3959+6.6 = ~3966

A^e = 4\*pi\*(3959)^2 = 196961284 sq mi

A^sky = 4\*pi\*(3966)^2 = 197658403 sq mi

So this means there is an increase of about 700000 sq miles, which is a lot, but only a .3% increase.

So yes Gavin, the sky is definitely bigger than the ground, but only barely. Thanks for entertaining me on my lunch break. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 3v3 strategy question - Group movement </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-14 22:15:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys, I'm a relatively new player, and had a quick strategy question about playing 3v3. The question will refer to **[this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/fQr5GJV.png)** 

So in this picture, there is a group of players about to approach the opposing teams goal with the ball (Orange arrow). We'll say this is a group that has two of my players and two on the other team, and they are moving with the ball. The other opposing player is on the border of their goal, playing defense.

I am the lone player not on that side of the court, but am approaching from my goal (Yellow Arrow). So here is my question. For the best chance at scoring the goal, should I approach with 1 or 2, assuming the timing isn't right for center?

With approach 1, I can cover the ball if it shoots out from the wall, and also better hit the ball if the opposing team stops the movement. However with approach 2 I can have a great hit on the goal if the ball gets out front, and also can get to the ball quicker if it leaves the group at all.

So this is my question to you, do you think it is better to go against the rotation, or with it, when approaching the other teams goal?

Believe it or not, as a beginner situations pop up like this all the time, so it would be great to know. I'm always unsure what way to go when I see it happening!

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there a fix to the issue of the phone switching off WIFI when the screen is turned off? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-02 20:45:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here is my details:

I have WIFI set to always on.

I have a strong WIFI connection

I've rebooted my phone, multiple times

Almost every time I turn off my screen for an extended period of time - more than a few minutes, my phone will switch off WIFI and turn on LTE. This has become a huge problem, because now I can no longer listen to Pandora without checking it every few minutes. I used a good bit of data last night because my phone turned off WIFI and used data when I had the screen off. If I turn-off background data, then Pandora won't even work unless I manually change the song.

I know this was a common issue, so is there any fix for it?

Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Meta] The Rooster Teeth subreddit does not like self posts - stats inside </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-02 16:12:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys. I noticed a lot of down-votes in this sub, and kind of wanted to dig in. I found out that, excluding posts by mods or RT employees, people really like to down-vote a lot of self posts on this sub.

What I did is just went through the 40 newest self posts, and took the score of each one. Here are my results:

 - Number of posts: 40

 - Average score: 4.375

 - **Median Score: 0**

 - Number of posts in double-digits: 4

 - **Number of posts at 0 points: 29!**

The funny thing is, these stats show that this posts has a very good chance of being down-voted and not seen by many people. So here comes the question:

Should we do something about this, and if so, what?

Some people think that this is okay, it just keeps the subreddit clean. However I am of the opinion that this is very stifling to open discussion. People might be afraid to post anything to this sub in fear of being down-voted. Obviously "fake internet point" aren't a big deal. However it is demoralizing to put a lot of effort into a post, or have an honest question, and have people just not give a damn.

So what can be done about it? Other different subs have different ways of dealing with stuff like this. Some subs hide the down-vote arrows. This isn't a perfect fix, and you can still downvote on mobile or with RES, but it does reduce rampant down-voting.

Another solution is that some subs use daily discussion threads for self-posts like these. The mods in this sub had a (in my opinion) great idea and started the free-talk Friday thread. Threads like these can be collectors for self-posts. The only issue I have is that if it's a Monday or Tuesday, you generally don't want to wait until Friday to post your thoughts, and the last week discussion thread is already dead.

So this is just something I wanted to share that I noticed. I hope it will lead into a discussion if there is anyway we can fix it, but then again the stats say people will just ignore it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> IRT RT Podcast #263 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-26 18:30:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First post, just want to set a bit of groundwork for how posts on this sub will work. This discussion involved [Burnie](/u/GusSorolaVERIFIED), /u/Gavinfree and the others.

So in this podcast one discussion they have is about [MH370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370) and how they could put a "bug" on it to track where they are. Gavin responds that bad guys could just use an EMP to disable the "bug" and still hijack the airplane.

This is such an interesting point to me because it actually lets me delve into one of my interests, airplanes, and it allows me to explain some differences in planes.

So the first thing is that you may not know what an EMP is. EMP stands for [Electromagnetic Pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse). A basic summary is that it is a pulse of energy that can destroy electronics and cause them to not work anymore. Gavin's theory was that detonating a small one would allow you to kill all tracking hardware on an airplane and still fly the plane to do what ever devious plan you have in mind.

What this all comes down to for me is that Gavin actually unknowingly highlights a huge development in [Aircraft Flight Control Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_flight_control_system). There are a few different ways that you can control an airplane. The first is mechanical, basically just rods, strings, etc. This is commonly used in old or small planes. An easy analogy is riding a bike, your direct movement of the handlebars leads to a direct movement of the wheel.

Another way of controlling an airplane is a hydro-mechanical system. This is similar to the first one, however it uses hydraulics. This is important because hydraulics allows pilots to control large systems without using too much physical exertion. This is akin to driving a car with power steering. You move the wheel, and it uses hydraulics to make it so it's not difficult to make a turn.

The final system I want to go over is the new [Fly-By-Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire) system. This system takes your input on the stick, converts it to a electrical signal, sends it to the control surface motors, and they perform the actions. This is almost akin to driving an RC car, where your control system isn't mechanically linked to the surface you are controlling.

Gavin's idea is really funny in this case, because of the airplane that went missing in this case. MH370 was flying a [Boeing 777](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777). The 777 was the first commercial aircraft that Boeing designed to use the fly-by-wire system.

As a consequence of this, Gavin's idea falls a bit flat, atleast in the case of the 777. Yes, using an EMP would probably stop tracking "bugs" from working, but it would also stop you from being able to control the plane, as none of the fly-by-wire system would work either. You can imagine how this would end up. But his point actually could *theoretically* work on older airplanes, like the older 737s! You would probably run into other problems, like the airplane having been upgraded, but the theory is there!

As a side note, EMPs and airplanes is actually a well-studied area. The E-4 is a large airplane that the US Air Force can use as a command post in the sky in the event of all out war. Because Nuclear Weapons can cause EMPs, this plane is actually [designed with that in mind!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4#Design). It uses analog control systems so it can still fly if everything else is going to hell. So, like many times before, /u/GavinFree made an offhand comment that is actually really insightful!

Thanks for reading. Hope you liked it! If you notice any mistakes please let me know, I'm not an expert, just an enthusiast!

<TEXT> Hi guys. I have a good sized bar in my house and want to try out some drink recipes that are RT inspired. My hope is to try them out, take pictures, review, etc., and make an Imgur album so people can choose to make them if they want.

So my question for the subs is: Have any ideas? I would like show related, people related, etc. I promise to give you a shout-out in the album when I make it if you come up with something good. One that I'm thinking about trying tonight is inspired by Gus. It's a shot of tequila for the Mexican side, topped with a bit of Tabasco for that Southern temper(?), and chased by pickle juice because lumpy pickles remind me of lumpy Gus.

So come on Reddit, kill my liver!

<TITLE> Youtube can only run videos at 144p </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi all. So recently, in the last couple of days, YouTube has been struggling to work for me. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/GxPsM0F.png) is an example of the quality I'm faced with. Now my network performance isn't bad. I paused a video and achieved [decent results](http://i.imgur.com/QzdV7oD.png). and while running a video, my system doesn't seem to [struggle](http://i.imgur.com/e9hhXOw.png). However if I run it at anything above 144p, it just can't buffer it. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

<TITLE> A shooting target that contains a flower seed bomb </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was looking at flower seed bombs, [like this](http://www.gardenista.com/posts/diy-wildflower-seed-bombs), and thought of a product for gun enthusiasts. Right now, many clay pigeons and other shooting products are biodegradable, so that you can shoot them and leave them at the range. I think that it would be cool if instead of just being biodegradable, they contained seeds.

With this, every time you go out to shoot at your local forest range, you could plant wildflowers as well. Beautify the area much more than before. What do you think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Link to Album here](http://imgur.com/a/wOpVR)

So this is my grandpa's old radio: A Stromberg-Carlson, Piece Number 17897, not sure on what model. It would mean a lot to my Mom if I could get it in running condition. Looking at the insides, it seems to be in decent condition, except the fabric style plugs make me cringe.

My question is, what would I need to do make sure this stereo will work and not catch on fire, etc? I can post more pictures as needed, take it apart, and all of that. 

Thanks for the help, and let me know what other information I need to provide!

<TITLE> Has anybody else been less than impressed with customer service lately? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-02 03:47:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've had a few problems going into Christmas, and overall have been pretty disappointed with the customer service Amazon has given me. My main problem was that I am a Prime customer, and have ordered a lot of things in the past year from Amazon. In my last report I had 130 items and spent about $3200 in the last year. 


In the last month I ordered a whole lot of Christmas gifts, about a grand worth of various things. Every single one was Prime, and yet 70% took longer than two days, even accounting for Sundays. A few even took 5 days, despite them being in stock when I ordered them in the middle of the day. I've heard that when this happens you should contact them, and I did. 

My response from the Customer Service department was that I should have chosen two-day shipping and checked the estimated delivery date when I ordered, both of which I did. And that was all they told me. This isn't the only problem I have had ([See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/2qbt1s/i_think_somebody_is_having_a_laugh_at_me_twice_i/)), but it is the most frustrating to me. I used to praise their customer service all the time, and now it just seems like they don't care.

Anybody else been having problems? Or am I just cursed with bad luck? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everybody. This year we are attempting to keep things more organized, and also more helpful to anybody new to the puzzle. Because of that we are hoping to do weekly hub posts. We need somebody that can help us collect all new information and weekly post a sticky that explains what has happened. This mod will also be in charge of keeping the wiki updated with information that is helpful to puzzle contributors. 

This will require somebody that can come to the sub and contribute at least an hour or two a week (depending on how much stuff has happened), so please don't apply if you can't contribute your time. We will give preference to those who contributed greatly last year, and those who have shown in other subs they are willing to contribute time.

So if you want to apply message the mods (on the right side of the page) and lets us know why you would be able to help, keeping in mind the preferences above. We will make our choices in a few days.

If you have any questions let me know! </TEXT>

Josh Wise was mentioned(by me because I don't know who else to support in Nascar), and told them I support Josh because of the whole Dogecoin thing, even though I'm wasn't part of it last week. Somebody asked what it was,a nd I realized that I have no idea how to explain it! So I need some help. I'm probably going there this weekend, and want to be able to explain Dogecoin and give the guys an explanation. Analogies are probably most helpful.

- Have something under $5 on your wishlist (I'm pretty much broke!) You can link or surprise

- Go to Google Maps, find me something with the word cake! Street name, a shop sign, etc! Then link it here by copying the address bar or posting a screenshot!

<TITLE> Laptop wont boot for a week or two, then works well for a week or two, then repeats </TITLE>

<TEXT> So like the title says, I have a Gateway NV55C, that will work great for a week of two. At one point it will just shut down, then for the next week or so after that, when the power button is pressed the fan will come on, the lights will flash, but no actual boot, or sometimes it does boot then shuts itself off after about ten minutes and won't boot again. After a week or two, it will start working again perfectly for a week or two and repeat.

I have tried it on Windows 7 and Ubuntu, it happens on both. I have switched out the Hard drive and it happened on both. I have replaced the thermal paste on the MB, happened before and after, although every time I take it apart it seems to work for a while then start doing it again. It seems to me it is something wrong with the MB, but not sure what it would be.It happens with or without battery in, and with or without power cord in.

<TITLE> How would I know if the Flies I have are good/valuable? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-22 18:03:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have found a large collection of flies at my house that seem old, and apparently they came from an old neighbor that decided he was too old to fly fish anymore. As much as I would love to go and fly fish, i have no money to go and get started. I was hoping to know if there is a way to find out if any are valuable so I could sell them to maybe buy some gear, and if any are good quality so I could keep them for my own future use. I was hoping for a general answer as there is a lot of flies. I know it's a good possibility they are all worth a few cents a piece, but maybe some might be worth something to somebody. 

For info, they seem to range from very small to medium size, but beyond that I know nothing about flies so I can't give anymore info. I have tied one before but that is about it. Would love to learn though!

Thanks for the help!

The Comcast Cable box(Edit: Digital Adapter, see below) I have only has a coaxial output. Is there an easier or cheaper way to hook this up than going through a VCR to change the coaxial to RCA?

Also, if this would fit somewhere else better please let me know.

##WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR##

- The timestamps on the back of the envelopes are not random, and most likely a clue was found from this, see [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/1u2yck/step_1_partially_solved_timestamps_on_back_of/ ). This clue spells out FEELFORGREEN, as seen [Here](http://i.imgur.com/aAtfcBt.png). Credit to /u/electro_mullet for the picture and /u/ewige (and some others in the thread) for figuring out the clue.
- [A website was also found, although we found it in the wrong order](http://butbeforeikillyoumrbondimustshowyouthetruemeaningofchristmas.com/). It tells us however, we need two 11 character clues. Also, the people from CAH are watching us. A possible way of finding the name of the website was found by /u/DoubleOhNine ([Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/1u62q5/running_of_this_thread_i_think_i_may_have_found_a/)). The original Cards Against Humanity kick starter included the James Bond card on the [page](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxtemkin/cards-against-humanity).

**/u/DaveLambert** got the [straight poop from Max] (http://www.reddit.com/r/cardsagainsthumanity/comments/1sbky6/question_about_the_holiday_bullshit_possible/cdy37sm) that the puzzle prize can be split up to cover any group working on it.

**ADDITIONALLY:** A clue directly from Max regarding the puzzle:

Gifting winner soon!


Alright, so I haven't ran a contest in a while, and I want to get something for somebody that is under $5! And I like Google Maps! So it's pretty simple how to enter this contest:

1. Have something under $5 on your WL.

2. Make sure you use the Raffle phrase "Nice to meet you, Brad!" (Because really I've been on here a while and don't know most of you)

3. And to relate it to Google Maps, find me the first letter of your username as a giant letter somewhere in the world. If your username starts with a number, do the first letter of the number spelled out. If you're using the new Google Maps, just copy and paste your address bar from Google in. It updates automatically now.

This contest ends tomorrow morning when I wake up, so get to it! I hope to do more Google Maps Scavenger hunts in the future, and maybe get more creative then just making you find a big letter. Also, here is a hint to help you find the letter you need:

<TITLE> How do I know if a Steve Largent jersey I have is real? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-27 17:53:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So back in the early 90's, as members of the Seahawkers, my parents won a Steve Largent jersey. According to the raffle, the jersey was supposed to be worn by Steve Largent in 1989, but was one of the remaining jerseys after he retired that wasn't used, one of apparently only 4. Because of that, it doesn't even have his name on it, only the number 80. Is there any way to verify if this is a real jersey? It's a bit dirty, so if it is real we would like to spend a bit of extra money to get it cleaned up.

<TEXT> My dad has a eT1641-02w computer, with stock motherboard. However it has failed, and instead of buying a whole new computer, we would like to upgrade the motherboard, and most likely the processor and memory too. I don't know much about replacing motherboards, but know enough about computers to think I can do this. Now my main questions is about what items will work.

[This](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813135315) is the board we were thinking about buying. Would it actually fit in with what we have already? i know we would need a new processor and memory, but don't mind buying those. Just want to make sure this board will actually fit in the case and is usable with everything.

Thanks

<TITLE> [College Differential Equations] Need stats on Youtube view history </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-27 23:22:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am doing a project on creating differential equations, and would like to create an equation to see if a Youtube video will become big. However, I can't figure out to see a history of views for a video. i.e. How many views did Gangnam Style have within its first week, two weeks, three weeks, and on. 


I was hoping somebody could help me either figure out a way to see stuff like that, or give me another way to figure out how a video is doing. I feel like Google trends doesn't give me enough info to be useful, but maybe there is a way to unlock more statistics.


Thanks for the help. </TEXT>

<TITLE> If the universe is expanding, are we able to see stars going backwards in time? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-23 00:36:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've recently learned in depth about the big bang, expanding universe, etc. Most of the sources use the expanding balloon analogy, where points on opposite sides of the universe are expanding away faster than the speed of light, therefore we can't see the stars across the universe. However I also read that the universe expansion is accelerating as well. So that leads me to believe a star that at one point was moving away slower than the speed of light could now be moving away faster. Would that mean from our vantage point a star could be going backwards in time, in terms of its lifespan? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is it about my area that makes it so hard for Meteorologists to predict the weather? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-01-17 06:23:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I live in the Inland Northwest in Spokane, Washington. Lately, our city has been under numerous watches and advisories about snow coming. Yet, it still hasn't been here, despite being predicted to start falling Sunday morning. Is there a reason that it is hard to get the weather right in our area? Or is it just a world-wide thing? 

For example, right now on two local news stations they have snow maps of the area. One station says a town will get 12 to 18 inches of snow, another says 1-4 inches for the same town. How can they be so different? Another example is today, in the process of looking at the weather, I looked at NOAA for my neighborhood three different times. Each time, in the space of 12 hours, had almost completely different snowfall amounts and temperatures for tomorrow.

My overall question is, is this difference in predicting due to the geographical area I live in? Or just meteorology in general?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I attend a small liberal arts college with a small Physics department. Inside that physics department we have an even smaller Engineering department. But a couple of friends and I want to start a community help based Engineering Club. My main questions are:

* Does anybody have any tips on making a small club have a big impact?

* Do you guys have any ideas on some projects we can do?

We are trying to keep it within the bounds of what we can do at our school and within what we have learned. Most of us our getting Engineering Physics degrees, because actual engineering degrees aren't offered. But we believe that having this experience will help us on the way to Grad School. Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

<TITLE> What Causes a Tail to Appear on the International Space Station? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-22 06:49:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First, background: I have watched the ISS many times before go over my city and out in the country. This is the first time I have ever noticed something out of the ordinary.
My dad and I were watching the space station go over tonight, and both thought our eyes were deceiving us. The station appeared to have a tail pointing towards the horizon. In all honesty, the best way I could desribe it was it made the space station look like sperm, with a straight tail. When I grabbed the binoculars to look at it, through magnification, it had no tail. But through the naked eye, it did have a tail. Can anyone explain what this "tail" was, and why I have never seen it before?

Some Quick details:

5 min pass starting at 9:28 local time

<TEXT> First off, I live in Spokane Washington. Many Boeing test flights take place nearby or overhead. A lot take place out of nearby Moses Lake. One thing I have noticed with the 747 test flights is that they have a chase plane. Or atleast thats what I think it is. Multiple times this summer and last my family and i have noticed the little jet on the tail or wingtip of the bigger 747. When tracked on Flightaware, I can only find the 747, not the smaller jet. My question is, what is the little jet, and what is it doing?

[Here](http://flightaware.com/live/flight/BOE8/history/20110731/2100Z/KMWH/KMWH) is the flightpath of one I seen with a jet on it. </TEXT>
