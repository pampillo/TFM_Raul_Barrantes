<TEXT>  You posted a photo of a hobby you do in a context of how you'd use it. By my standards you'd be completely fine.

When you said "posting a weapon with no context" I had assumed you meant that we lacked the knowledge of the context. Obviously there is a reasoning behind the post, a context. But the same as someone happening upon my post, the context is not obvious to an ignorant observer.

This conversation is pointless because we don't know the circumstances of the child who originally got suspended.

The child who originally got suspended? As far as I'm aware there is a single child who got suspended, so the distinction here confuses me. 

But if the child never showed an interest in airsoft, never talked about wanting to play on the weekends. And then randomly posts a photo of a gun that says "ready," I would take notice.

Sure, take notice. Now are you saying that is what happened, and you have evidence to show? Because otherwise that's just baseless speculation.

In an age where school killings exist, you cannot idly stand behind vague statements of guns. The reality is an airsoft gun resembles a real gun, and that concidencde is not lost on children.

I'm 24, when I was 17 the climate was no different than it is now. In fact I have a fairly distinct memory of being sent home for a day because my Halloween costume included a trench coat that year.


The physiological evaluation begins at a conversation. If you know these kids and they're completely harmless, then you tell them to not associate their image with vague displays of weapons. And you don't support it.

Why? Because you don't like it? Because you associate guns with fear, and intimidation, and attention seeking behavior? I've been using guns since I was 10 years old. I received my hunting license at 13 after taking a safety course. I've posted a fair few pictures of guns on social media, for a while my profile picture on MySpace was the rifle I enjoyed using the most. I had several pictures of myself holding weapons, showing them off. There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of that, and I'm disgusted at you trying to twist it around so that there is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 17 I played airsoft. I posted a picture on facebook of myself in full tactical gear holding an airsoft rifle. By your standard my school should have pulled me aside and had me evaluated because I had a hobby that I enjoyed and wanted to show off.

Your assessment is absurd. An airsoft gun is not necessarily a weapon, in the same way that a hockey stick and a baseball bat are not necessarily weapons. Even if it were, liking someones post of an airsoft gun does not mean you are seeking to draw attention and cause fear, you have drawn no connection there. All you've done is make baseless assertions about the implications. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  strategic timing

Supposing it was a Russian state actor the timing damn near couldn't have been worse. There is a political media blackout in France.

previous hacking attempts on Macron by Russia

Failed attempts are not proof of success.

document metadata leading to a Russian security contractor

I've given several explanations for that, all of which you have no disagreed with so I'm inclined to believe you're either being intellectually dishonest or you're just not reading the things I say to you.

fabricated documents

That is a fact that, in of itself, in no way points to Russian state actors. 

pattern of previous Russian interference with democracies

Russia is hardly alone on this front. You'd be hard pressed to find a single major nation who you could not accurately make that statement about.

coziness with the Le Pen campaign 

That is in no way evidence of the assertion you are making.


You can try to construct an alternative explanation, but it'll need to be pretty convincing.

No, it wont. All it needs to be is plausible. And you're just being ridiculous at this point, because I already listed 4 such alternatives. Again I have to wonder, do you just not really read the things I'm saying, or are you being intellectually dishonest? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you have any information I don't about how the hack was done? I can't seem to find any specifics about how the emails were attained. 

To answer the question of why, I would suggest that there are many reasons. 

To name just a few, if there is an easy way to distinguish between fake a real emails and the real ones contain nothing incriminating then it's perfectly plausible that the campaign, or an allied group/individual with similar goals, leaked it themselves in order to rally voters in their favor. A false flag attack, if you will.

If there is not, then it could just be the act of someone(s), unrelated to the security firm in question, who is hoping to damage the campaign while also creating a patsy so that their involvement is less likely to be discovered.

It could also be an actual attempt releasing the emails to the public with good intentions, that was corrupted by someone(s) somewhere along the process. It's even possible that the campaign themselves planted red herrings so that in the event of a leak they could point to them and say "yes we were hacked, but look clearly you can't trust these documents". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why could this not be the work of just a single individual who is fairly competent?

Why does creating a patsy mean that this isn't some random security firm with only a bit above average level of competence?

I don't know a ton about IT security, but I know enough that I'm reasonably certain that it's not beyond the capability of a single competent actor, or group of actors, to find the name of an employee who works for a Russian security contractor and then spoof his signature while editing the files or something along those lines.

And I disagree that this is a small mistake. This is a huge mistake. This is a mistake that, should it actually be a mistake and not a red herring, pretty much ruins any value they could have been seeking from leaking these documents.

The headlines turn from "Macron implicated in scandal through leaked emails" to "Russian security firm with governmental ties attempts to smear Macron through false email leak"


Also one has to wonder about the timing. It's a well known fact that the French impose a media blackout in regards to politics in the 2 days prior to an election. This is pretty much the worst time they could have leaked the documents. </TEXT>

You are, of course, not being reductionist but rather extremely unbiased and logical in your examination.

Yup, that silly National Transportation Safety Board. They're wasting their time DEMANDING passenger manifests in the event of a crash because they're completely useless pieces of information.


I'm trying really hard right now not to be extremely rude, but your ridiculous assertions and vapid statements of how "[you're] sorry my argument is invalid" because you've come up with some overly simplified example, and because the information isn't 100% reliable, I feel like you're so ridiculously biased that there's no real avenue for logical discussion.

<TEXT> I disagree that a courts disagreement in this case would constitute bad judgment. The dad signed a contract, whether he likes the terms or not. And contracts are binding, all the terms therein to be upheld (within reason), not just the ones that suit you in the moment. 

Imagine if you contracted a builder to erect an addition onto your house, but when you finally see it finished you see that instead of the schematics you received planning permission based on, they've drawn up entirely different ones and have completed the build based off of them. When you tell them that this isn't what you've contracted them for, they tell you too bad you contracted them and they get to build what they want.

Obviously the two situations aren't identical, one is clearly more egregious than the other. Yet both constitute violations of contracts. The core of the issue is the same. You have laid out the rules, both parties have agreed, but then one party just says "lul fuck that shit" and does whatever they want anyways.

Do I agree with the stipulation in question? No, I think it's a devious money-grubbing tactic with a tiny bit of merit in that passenger lists are valuable pieces of date for many reasons.

For instance, in the event of a crash passenger lists are handed off to the NTSB so that they can identify bodies, live ones aswell if they exist. So they get handed a list that says that the passenger in seat D5 is Guy Boberson, whom they've just so happened to find alive, and he gets brought to the hospital under that pretense and is treated under that pretense. But it turns out who they actually have is Gary Smith, who it turns out is allergic to the antibiotics they're giving him and he goes into anaphylaxis and dies and none of that would have happened if Gary had just forked over the money and changed the name on the ticket.

I flat out don't agree with charges for changing the name on a ticket days in advance, but I also flat out don't agree with not changing the name on the ticket at all. Just take your lumps, pay the price you've agreed to pay in the eventuality, and then take the next week off work and picket the bloody airline.

But understand that passenger lists are valuable, not just monetarily, and that not upholding contractually obligations can cut both ways. </TEXT>

It's almost like we have some sort of systemic issue or something. Naw, can't be, must be them damn dirty righties/lefties.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely and wholeheartedly disagree that you can understand Stalin the politician without understanding Stalin the man. After all, his actions and words as a politician didn't arise ex nihilo, his personal life and political life are inextricable if one wants to understand the why, and not just the how.

Stalin's first son, Yakov, shot himself. He missed his heart, and instead hit his lung. While his stepmother was tending to the wound, waiting for a doctor to arrive, Stalin is quoted as having said "He can't even shoot straight."

Later, his son being captured during WWII by the Germans, Stalin was offered an exchange. For Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus he would receive his son. Stalin refused the trade. His son later succeeded in his second suicide attempt by running into the electric fence surrounding the concentration camp in which he was held.

Do you find that immediate and personal? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My point is that not every leader who leaves behind a great legacy, leaves behind a legacy that includes some good. 

And I believe that's a fact that should be accepted, accounted for, but not treated as cause for renouncing the observation of things created by these leaders. 

If you find their legacy to be repugnant and don't want to even look near it that's your perogative. 

Personally, I think that it's all the more reason to look, because if a great person does terrible, disgusting things, it's important to examine what they did and how they did it in an effort to prevent someone similar from rising to that same greatness. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  lets say that 10% of people are gay, and 50% of people are women. If all were equal, we'd expect that 45% of mass shootings would be committed by straight men.

Uhhhhh, no. We would expect that with a large enough sample size 45% would be committed by straight men. But when our sample size is maybe a bit more than 100 cases, and less than 4% of the population identify as gay, well it sounds to me like you're jumping the gun here.

So [~4%](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/how-many-people-are-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender/) of the US population identify as homosexual. Now there were [90 mass shootings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26822013) between 1996 and 2012, so call that 90 individuals who committed mass shootings.

So since the population of the US is [~323,000,000](https://www.census.gov/popclock/) that would make mass shooters  
~0.00003% of the population. Assuming those numbers were to hold for the gay community, 0.00003% of 4% of 323,000,000 is ~4. So 4/12920000, and while I've always been pretty terrible at statistics that deviation from the expected result would seem to be reasonably accounted for by small sample size.

<TEXT>  This needs some clarification to make sure we're talking about the same thing, because that word can have two different meanings depending on the context.
 "Equal" can refer to how much a person is valued, or how important they are, or what rights they have ("equality under the law"). In that context, I most certainly do believe that men and women have equal value. I don't think that women should be denied any rights or whatever.
 But "equal" might also mean "same" as in, identical. Specifically, that would mean, "contributes the same things to the relationship." This would be the context where I'd answer, "no." So if your question is, "how can you connect with a partner if you do not view them as contributing the same things" then my answer is, I don't think that's a requirement in order for a relationship to be healthy or functional. I don't believe a whole must be made of identical parts. My view is that men and women are different, and can compliment each other. Think yin and yang.
 I prefer a relationship where my partner and I agree on complimentary roles. Now, that does not mean that prescribe a role - not in a relationship, and certainly not in society (that is, I wouldn't say something like, "that's a man's job"). Rather, it means that I am comfortable with this preference. I don't think that it's morally wrong or that I should suppress it.
 In practical terms, this is rarely an issue. I just act the way I want to act, and if she doesn't like it, she wont want to hang out with me anymore. If we get along, that's great. If not, don't force it.

That was a mighty long way to say "that depends what the definition of "is" is." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If the Holocaust were real, or really involved gassing millions of people to death, historical examination would confirm it.

Well it would certainly seem that it does to most people.

If it weren't real, or didn't really involve homicidal gas chambers, the world deserves to know.

Sure, I can agree with that.

The problem is, under scrutiny the story falls apart.

Under what scrutiny? Be specific.

The only evidence of homicidal gas chambers is the photos, lurid stories from prisoners, and a forced confession or two, extracted via torture.

So it's your contention that every account is false? Have you tried corroborating accounts? What evidence do you have of forced confessions?  Could you give an example of one such forced confession, and why you believe it was forced?

The "vast and overwhelming majority" of people who are in positions of academic authority would never dare cast any doubt about the Holocaust narrative because they would lose their tenures and in some countries be arrested. 

Do you understand how tenure works? The main point of tenure is academic freedom. Excepting in countries where holocaust denial is illegal, which is not a concept I agree with, this argument is a load of baloney.


The doors opening inward would be absurdly impractical since you would have a pile of dead bodies blocking the door every time you went in. 

That's a good point, I hadn't thought of that. So I googled around a bit, and from what I can find this was the original design, that the doors would open inward, [but later on the Nazi's learned from their mistake and designed them with doors that opened outward, along with other changes for the sake of efficiency.](http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Hans_HC/media/Overview_slide_door_zps65gp99tm.png.html)

Just one reason this fabled Rube Goldberg system of shaving, gassing, and getting all these people in mass graves would never work on a practical level.

Mass graves? Cmon man, you've clearly done some level of research, you know [there were no mass graves.](https://www.google.ie/search?q=holocaust+piles+of+bodies client=opera hs=8ot source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0ahUKEwjembvO76nTAhXLJMAKHXAsCI8Q_AUICCgB biw=1920 bih=972)  </TEXT>

Got a source? Or is that your personal contention? What evidence do you have for this interpretation of available data, why do you believe this over other interpretations?

The rooms we are to believe were gas chambers bear little or no resemblance to actual gas chambers as they are wooden, not airtight

Uhhhhhh, I'm looking at the gas chambers on that google search and none of them are wooden. And they all look pretty airtight. 

some of the doors open inward which is preposterous

Explain.

ven if there were a plan for genocide, which there was never any evidence of

And yet, oddly, the vast and overwhelming majority who spend their lives studying historical evidence would disagree. That's a very odd circumstance, don't you think? If that were the case, why would quite so many people, with so much investment into discerning historical truth, disagree? Because I can't think of any reason.

I am not saying all mentally ill people shoot people, I am not saying that a majority of mentally ill people shoot people, I am not even saying that 0.00000000000000000000001% of mentally ill people shoot people, though considering the reality it is an implication that more than that have to shoot people for it to be a regular occurence. I am saying that it is a regular occurrence that someone, not everyone, who has a mental illness will shoot people.

It is also a regular occurrence that someone without a mental illness will shoot people. In fact it's much more regular. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm certain that you don't see what I'm saying. Because if you did the way you would go about disproving it would be showing that someone with a mental illness shooting people is not a regular occurence. Instead what you've done is show that the majority of gun-related killings were not perpetrated by someone with mental illness.

These are not contradictory statements.

If every day of the year someone with a mental illness shot people, it would be a regular occurrence. Even if that only accounted for 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of shootings, it would still be a regular occurrence. </TEXT>

You mean 1.35-1.4 aps. At that rate of attacks it takes a tiny bit less than 45% attack speed to reach 2 attacks a second, which lets you cap out on cast speed with CoC. And since crit cap isn't particularly hard to reach with Assassin there's no problem here. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   except for just the fact that there FAR more intersex people (even physically) than are reported

While I can't speak to the truth of that statement, I wonder as to it's relevance. Gender and sex are not the same thing, they are separate concepts.


 alongside the fact that people may not FEEL they are either social gender

I would question the validity of those feelings until such a time as there has been established a condition along the lines of gender dysphoria. I'm not interested in dealing with nebulous declarations of how people might feel. I once met a man who said he felt that he was a dragon, people might feel alot of crazy shit or they might just be acting out for some underlying reason. I don't see how playing into that helps the person, and I can see many scenarios in which it can be very harmful.

so i think including singular they/them to the mix is totally fine as well, i mean, it's already singular when attempting to be ambiguous, as 'it' is clearly marked as an inhuman pronoun.

I have no problem with they/them.

<TEXT> Well, a language is an amorphous concept, so technically speaking *it* can't be damaged. What I meant is that it could damage the ability we have to effectively communicate using the english language. So, for instance, let's say we start using "xir" as a pronoun. But what does "xir" mean? If I say "xir was going down to the beach" a person who knows the words will know what I mean, but a person who doesn't will not. Now you might say that it's a simple matter of teaching this ignorant person what xir means. Not even getting into how you explain the definition of a pronoun which was created by a person to essentially specifically refer to whatever they might be, my main problem arises when you do this on a population scale with thousands and thousands of people all making their own pronoun. It's a short step away from either not being capable of effectively communicating, or having the majority of your vocabulary taken up by pronouns. Which is why, as I said, this specific issue wouldn't exist if there were a consensus. 

Not only that, but I don't believe it's correct to pander to people like this as I can see no reason to do so. I have very little idea why they do what they do, but I have seen no evidence for the reality they present. If someone is transgender then I will refer to them as he or she, whichever they like, and I'll do so because I understand that they have a condition, gender dysphoria, and not doing so is harmful. But I'm not aware of any condition which causes a person to present with a hereto unknown third, fourth, or in the case of New York City twenty nine genders. 

Humans are a sexually dimorphic species, with gender presenting in a modified bimodal distribution. There are men who act more feminine, and there are women who act more masculine, and there are even men who present as totally feminine and women who present as totally masculine. But the fact remains that it is bimodal, not trimodal or any variation thereof. </TEXT>

Where did I say that the English language never changes?


Where did I say that the change in question is necessarily a bad thing?


I'll tell you, just to save time. I didn't.

What I said was many different groups all trying to force changes, some through legislation others through social guilt, is not a good thing. Especially when that change is targeted at a [closed class](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-closed-class-words-1689856).


If people would like to present words, and hope that they one day become common speech that's fine. But that's not what is happening. What is happening is many different groups trying to force changes. 

Shakespear didn't try and pressure people into using his words. He didn't legislate for his words to be used. He wrote words, people like them, and they become part of common parlance and eventually part of the formal English language.  </TEXT>

His statement in the video you linked:

The way we film these things is over 6 days. And when I'm filming the live night stuff out I'm out with a sort of camel carcass, or up a tree. And then when we're not filming the night stuff I'll stay with the crew, ya know wherever that is. Whether it's in a tented camp area in the sahara, or a jungle lodge in a rain forest or wherever. But, um, yeah you need to kinda take the rough with the smooth a bit. 


Those are ridiculously different things. You're saying he sleeps in a hotel every night, he's saying that when they film him at night he is sleeping outside, and when they aren't filming the night shots he sleeps with the crew. Which makes complete sense.

The point of the show is to have Bear dumped into hostile environmentd, then do his best to survive while actively vying to personally reach civilization.

It is not an educational show that demonstrates survival tactics, per say. Rather, it's a show created for entertainment value that happens to include some survival tactics.

<TEXT> So you're saying that if you "free up the market" prices will become the same as they are in other countries? In other words, insurance companies will, for no reason, make far less money in America by paying more for the healthcare they need to provide but charging the same amount for the insurance? And you think this will happen if you just "free up the market"? Does "free up the market" mean " sprinkle magical pixie dust" in American? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Streamers like Mr_Aek have shown faster ways than BV. Him and I worked together to get speeds within 10 seconds of the top runners last league. If you knew anything what so ever about the currency meta of lab running, you'd know this. I'm not going to hold your hand. You're the one spouting off as if you know what people are doing at the top. Go watch Mr_Aek or one of the other top streamers. Their stream link is literally on their ladder name. You're just being lazy.

It's not my job to evidence your statements, you're the lazy one not me. If you'd like to make a claim, while complaining about my lack of evidence for my claim, then you can either provide evidence or you can kindly go fuck yourself.

All he has to do is hit you once to wif your (sometimes) perfect run. Please spare me the cynical comments. Nobody here cares.

I'm sorry, is it too much effort for you to dodge the maybe one slam or major attack that'll happen in those 3 seconds? Because that's the only thing that's gonna 1 shot you. His auto-attack certainly wont.

If you can kill him faster and safer than BV, and choose not to because, 'it's easy.' Go ahead.

The fuck are you talking about? You're the one claiming you have a way to kill him faster and safer than BV, although you have yet to provide this method.

<TEXT> So first off, Jugg node specifies both movement speed and speed, which right away tells you that there are two stats at work here. Secondly, it says "below base movement speed" and "below base speed", which tells you that it wont slow you below what your base speed is, before any modifiers like movespeed from boots or such.

In my opinion, the way it works makes perfect sense and is intuitive so long as you actually read the node. 

Kaom's Roots is a different case, but that's because it doesn't imply that there is a difference between speed and movement speed. Imo the term "speed" should be changed to "animation speed", or something similar, to avoid this confusion. </TEXT>

Or, well, I say applied, what I mean is that he told them he would be leaving if they didn't give him a position which had recently been vacated. But apparently they have to open the position to the public. The requirements for the position were written based on his resume, because he worked closely with the person who previous held the job and who wrote the requirement before he left, and besides that it required a working knowledge of the IT operations of all international branches of the company, which only he and the previous occupant had. He was literally the only option for the position, but he had to blackmail the company into giving it to him, and even then they took in resumes and apparently performed several interviews for a position which they had essentially already filled. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Having an indexer doesn't mean you have everything you could ever need. Ask your parents to set up any indexer to give you pings depending on very specific search parameters. Could they do it?

Well my dad is a System Architect, so he'd be much better at doing so than I am. But I get your point, I just don't see the relevance. So someone who knows nothing about poe couldn't set up searches? Are you saying that your issue is you don't know what to search? Because if so, I would recommend starting with things you want to buy.

If it's so easy to do, how come not everyone is doing it?

In the past 3 days I've linked over 25 Vinktar flasks in my guild chat, showing all the currency I made running Vinktar maps. Yet not a single person in my guild tried running Vinktar maps. 

In the past 3 weeks I've linked countless chests and weapons I've scour chanced, showed all the currency I've made from it. Yet only one person tried to do it, to great success, but they only did it to get their own chest then never tried again.

People are lazy, or at least not particularly self-interested.

And if everyone is already using those tools, why not just put them in the game instead?

First off, not everyone is. Secondly, I have no idea. Why would you ask me about the motives of another person? I have no more insight into GGGs doings than you or anyone else. </TEXT>

I for one have never parsed the API personally, I've used poe.trade woops but hardly ever, not a single time in the past week or so. Yet I have a char worth 30-40ex, about 23ex currency, 4 +1 arrow Signal Fires, and more.

<TEXT> My point is that people like Danny are thrown out on the street when they do need help. Hospitals like this don't have funding to keep people who are screaming under bridges against their will.

That isn't true of every such hospital. New York City is a very wealthy area for the most part, I guarantee they would have many well funded mental hospitals. 

I think it's harmful because people imagine that places like this do exist. They don't see a need for more funding for mental healthcare - or they have unreasonable expectations about what can be done when people do need help.

Are you under the impression that every single public mental health facility in the United States is a run down hell hole or something?

And seriously, you're being ridiculous. This depiction isn't going to make people believe mental healthcare in reality is amazing any more than someone watching Batman is going to make them think Gotham city is real. This is fantasy, the majority of people are perfectly capable of separating reality and fiction.

Of course people can be held against their will, but there are a lot of processes. If Danny isn't there as a criminal defendant, then he's there on a hold against his will without any hearing to determine if he's a danger to himself or others? 

That would be a reasonable explanation, but no explicit statement is made.

It makes sense if it's corrupt, but the other patients make no sense.

What about them makes no sense? We see a man who claims to have tried to commit suicide 4 times, with the scars to prove it, another man who beat a woman to death with a hammer, another man who we're told is a paranoid schizophrenic, what exactly is your issue here?

<TEXT> Well first off they made not a single mention of that, so if that's their point they made an awful job of explaining it. 

Secondly, that's not really true. The only times they dopped him up were when he first got in there and they were under the impression that he was prone to violence, hence the straps, and then the two times he actually had a violent outburst. Other than that he was on some of what were probably anti-psychotics, which is perfectly reasonable considering their perspective. Imagine it from the view of the hospital workers. You're holding a man who was brought to you because he shows obsessive, his stalking of Joy and breaking into her house, and delusional, his claims that he is a person they believe died 15 years ago, behaviors. And that's not even getting into what Ward probably would have told the hospital. Then throw in his assault of another patient, you and I know it's self defense but they dont, and his trashing of the doctor's office. I'm no psychiatrist, but based purely on the facts just listed I'd be quite fearful of what such a person might do.

And there's no dichotomy between constant medication and psychiatric evaluation. I'm not sure how well you remember the episode, but they did evaluate him. He had several sessions with a doctor, eventually managing to convince the man that he is actually Danny Rand. But then he ballsed it up by telling the doctor how he was taken in by warrior monks and given special powers from a dragon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the hell was going on there? First off Danny kicks Howard in the face, then just runs off in a straight line rather than taking the gun away and ending the fight there. It took him longer to run straight forward away from Howard, than it would have to just bend down and pick up the gun. 

But I guess I can sorta understand that, they could have gone about it better but they needed more time for exposition. But then we have Howard beating the shit out of Danny in a straight fight. That makes no sense at all. Even if Danny had 2 arms tied behind his back and was blindfolded, based on every fight we've seen with these two throughout the series, Danny should have easily bested him. It makes no sense at all the Howard would have any chance in that fight, so I just don't understand it. Why not just not have him lose the gun if you wanted the fight to keep going? </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, Sell v. United States created stringent limits on the rights of the lower court to order forcible administration of anti-psychotics to criminal defendants. It has nothing at all to do with administering medications to mental health patients. And it doesn't require, as you say, "a ton of hearings". It just limits the scope of lower courts previous power to order such medicines. 

Secondly, since you'd like to talk about legal precedents lets talk about 5150, also known as the Involuntary Psychiatric Hold. With probable cause a qualified officer or clinician can issue a 5150, probable cause being evident danger to one's self or others or a major disability, a 5150 allows that the person in question is held for psychiatric evaluation. Now this isn't technically relevant to the show, but it both proves a point, and is a good example because it's often featured in popular media because it's Californian law. New York, the state/city the show takes place in, has similar laws that you're more than welcome to research yourself. 


Finally, "This depiction feeds into the idea that even people who aren't mentally ill get permanent housing." that is the most non-point out of all of them. Just to start, there is no doubt that Danny honestly needs mental health help. Then there's the fact that he was held for a psychiatric evaluation in order to determine whether he would be held more long term, so I have no idea where on earth you're getting this idea from. As far as I can tell you're just pulling this out of your ass. There is absolutely no details that speak to this sentiment.


To sum up, you're full of shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Incredibly vague? Well yeah, it's an analogy. If analogies get specific then they fall apart, because no two things are truly analogous just partially analogous. 

And I could make the same comment about your critique. It's incredibly vague, you don't actually give any details just "your analogy is vague, it's not coherent". How isn't it coherent? Where exactly is the disconnect? Just saying "there is no coherence", that may be so but that's still a terrible critique. If I didn't see this lack of coherence before, then why would I see it now just because you merely alluded to it's existence?

To try and explain my analogy, the highway speed limit is the animation speed stat. Just like animation speed dictates how fast your character does things, highway speed dictates how fast cars can move. Movement speed is being compared to how fast your car is capable of moving. The car is your character. So in the analogy, say the highway speed limit were reduced by 10 miles, your animation speed is slowed by 10%, your car would be slowed down by 10 miles. Now if you had a pass from the cops, Kaom's Roots, that said you don't have to abide by this new speed limit, your reduced animation speed, you would keep going at the same speed. But let's say you run over a nail, you get reduced movespeed, well it doesn't matter what you got from the cops your car is still gonna slow down because what's being affected is not the highway speed but rather the speed your car is a capable of moving. 


Obviously if you get to far into the it the analogy falls apart because cars can move faster than the speed limit, and the cops are never going to tell you that you can break the speed limit, and cars can still drive even with a busted tire, and many other discrepancies with reality. Hence why the analogy has to be vague. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you're saying that you edited that image in photoshop or w/e to add in those health bars, then GGG banned you because, and I'm assuming here because it didn't seem very clear to me, because they saw that as evidence you were using a 3rd party program to modify game content? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just to be clear, the image you showed in photoshop near the end is the image in question that got you banned right? You're saying you edited the image to add in stuff like the health bars and arrow and stuff? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can search guild members by name and see how long since a guild member has logged in, how are those not guild improvements? Like I agree with what your saying, but your title is bullshit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Think of it this way, animation speed is the highway speed limit, movespeed is how fast your car can go. Just because you have boots that say "speed limit cannot be modified" doesn't mean your tires can't be blown out, where your tires being blown out means reductions to move speed rather than animation speed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The major complaint was that drops were made artificially low

Do you know what the term "artificially" means? Because there is no such thing as a non-artificial drop rate, low or high.

 Well guess what, that is exactly what PoE does. 

Where'd you get that idea?

They expect you to have to trade to progress.

The fuck is the ssf league then? If GGG expects you to have to trade then why is there an entire league with no difference except that trading and partying is disallowed? That seems pretty counter to that entire idea, doesn't it? </TEXT>
