<TEXT> Climate changes is happening! The question is how much it will cost us so that we can say how much we want to invest ot prevent it: Approximately 3% in terms of GDP (or income) are the total aggregate welfare impacts of climate change according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap10_FINAL.pdf) if temperature rises remain below 3C (see p. 690). The IPCC further writes on p. 690 that "[e]stimates agree on the size of the impact (small relative to economic growth), and 17 of the 20 impact estimates shown in Figure 10-1 are negative." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the abstract: This paper looks at how individual attitudes towards the allocation of government spending change along the life cycle. As individuals age and re-evaluate the benefits and costs of government programs, such as education, healthcare and old-age pensions, they also influence the level and composition of government spending. Using the Life in Transition Survey II for 34 countries of Europe and Central Asia, we find that older individuals are less likely to support hikes in government outlays on education and more likely to support increases in spending on pensions. These results are very similar across countries, and they do not change when using alternative model specifications, estimation methods and data sources. To our knowledge, this the first paper to provide evidence of the grey peril effect for a large group of developed, middle-income and low-income economies. Our findings are consistent with a body of literature arguing that conflict across generations over the allocation of government expenditure may intensify in ageing economies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is widely believed that economic institutions such as competitive markets, the banking system, and the structure of property rights are essential for economic development. But why economic institutions vary across countries and what are their deep origins is still a question that is widely debated in the developmental economics literature. In this study, we provide an empirical test for the provocative hypothesis that the prevalence of infectious diseases influenced the formation of personality traits, cultural values, and even morality at the regional level (the so called Parasite- Stress Theory of Values and Sociality), which then shaped economic institutions across countries. Using the prevalence of pathogens as an instrument for cultural traits such as individualism, we show in a two-stage least squares analysis that various economic institutions, measured by different areas of the index of Economic Freedom by the Heritage Foundation, have their deep origins in the historical prevalence of infectious diseases across countries. Our causal identification strategy suggests that cultural values affect economic institutions even after controlling for a number of confounding variables, geographic controls, and for different sub-samples of countries. We further show that the results are robust to four alternative measures of economic and political institutions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the abstract: Studies of deprivation usually ignore mental illness. This paper uses household panel data from the USA, Australia, Britain and Germany to broaden the analysis. We ask first how many of those in the lowest levels of life-satisfaction suffer from unemployment, poverty, physical ill health, and mental illness. The largest proportion suffers from mental illness. Multiple regression shows that mental illness is not highly correlated with poverty or unemployment, and that it contributes more to explaining the presence of misery than is explained by either poverty or unemployment. This holds both with and without fixed effects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes... as almost all instruments, this one is highly problematic and questionable. However, the simple correlations seem quite strong and the problem with the exclusion restriction is at least discussed. Others (Gorodnichenko and Roland 2011 AER) have used distance of frequency of blood types A and B as an instrument for individual responsibility which is also questionable. But not matter what you do, it seems that there is something interesting in this variable "individual responsibility" which needs to be further explored.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Summary: The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it tests whether an effect of over-indebtedness on self-assessed health exists. Fixed-effects panel regression models based on panel data for 25 European countries show that being in arrears increases the likelihood of reporting bad/very bad health. However, effects are weak in terms of economic significance. The second research question focuses on the effect heterogeneity of overindebtedness among different European countries. It asks whether country-level factors moderate the effect of problematic debt on health. These macro-variables are the accessibility of health services, debt management and debt discharge regulations, dispute resolution with banks/insurance companies, and the social stigma of being over-indebted/in debt. Descriptive analyses showed that some aspects of the legal debt-collection process (e.g., higher costs of debt collection) are associated with a stronger effect of over-indebtedness on subjectively assessed poor health. There is also some evidence that easier dispute resolution with banks and insurance companies is correlated with smaller effects of over-indebtedness on health. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Summary of article:
Anecdotal evidence suggests that people migrate to avoid air pollution. In this paper, we empirically examine the extent to which air pollution is a push factor for international migration. We allow air pollution to affect migrants differently according to their educational attainment as well as their gender. We also instrument for the level of pollution. Results generally show that air pollution is positively associated with emigration for higher educated individuals but less so for those with less educational attainment. Gender differences are less pronounced. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Summary

Models of political competition portray political candidates as seeking the support of the median voter to win elections by majority voting. In practice, political candidates seek supermajorities, rather than majorities based on support of the median voter. We study the political benefits of supermajorities using data from Bavaria, the largest German state. Members of the Bavarian parliament had been permitted to hire relatives as office employees, but in the year 2000 the practice was prohibited, with exceptions that allowed continuation of employment of previously hired relatives. The circumstances provide an informative setting to relate political behavior to protection of incumbency. Our results show that the likelihood of politicians hiring relatives increased with the margin of the majority for the incumbent in the previous election. When the majority increased by one percentage point, the likelihood of hiring relatives increased by about one percentage point. Supermajorities thus facilitated political rent extraction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the abstract: This paper investigates whether financial cooperatives are crowded out by commercial banks in the process of financial sector development. We use a self-constructed database based on World Council of Credit Unions data for the years 1990-2011 of cooperatives in 55 developing countries. Our empirical results are threefold. First, financial cooperatives tend to reach more members in countries where the commercial banking sector is weak. This validates their role as a banking market failure solution. Second, in the process of commercial bank expansion, financial cooperatives run the risk of being crowded out. Third, the relationship is actually complex, since financial cooperatives seem to benefit from some kind of bank presence, especially as far as savings mobilization is concerned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the abstract: The impact of physical attractiveness and resulting advantages of physical attractive people is a popular research field. Nevertheless, few studies have analysed the relationship between physical attractiveness and sporting performance. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first to investigate the relationship between physical attractiveness of professional (female tennis players and their sporting success in terms of prize money earned and probabilities of winning. Moreover, we can determine further factors which have a significant influence on the prize money earned and the likelihood to win a tennis match. Therefore, we investigate professional female tennis players, which were ranked in the top 100 of the tennis world ranking in one selected week in 2011. OLS regressions demonstrate a significant positive relationship between physical attractiveness and sporting success in terms of prize money for the years 2012 and 2013 as well as for the whole career. Further significant drivers are the BMI and its square, the number of played tournaments and the career duration. Furthermore, the study examines whether the probability of winning an individual tennis match is influenced by physical attractiveness. The logit model used shows that the larger the difference in physical attractiveness, the higher the probability of winning for the more attractive tennis player in individual matches. Moreover, difference in world ranking place and difference in the number of years as a professional tennis player have a significant impact on the winning probability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abstract: Using panel data on professional footballers and their teams over a seven year period we find a substantial wage premium for migrants which persists within teams and is only partially accounted for by players' on-field labour productivity. We show that the differential partly reflects the superstar status of migrant workers. This superstar effect is apparent in migrant effects on team performance and crowd attendance. </TEXT>

This setting allows us to evaluate the median voter models quality with revealed constituents preferences. Results indicate a limited explanatory power of the median voter model: It explains 17.6% points more than random voting and that a senators probability to accept a proposal in parliament increases on average by 8.4% points when the district median voter accepts the proposal. </TEXT>

Here is the abstract: Although previous research demonstrates that proportionality positively impacts the congruence between the positions of the government and the public after elections, recent work argues and shows that proportionality dampens policy responsiveness in between elections. Why this is true is unclear, however. This paper considers how proportionality matters for policy responsiveness, focusing on two primary suspects: (1) the friction associated with coalitions in proportional systems and (2) the comparatively weaker electoral incentives in those systems. In this paper we first assess the general effect of electoral systems, showing that results are robust across measures, and also that the impact of electoral systems increases exponentially alongside party fragmentation. We then examine two alternative mechanisms at work in proportional systems, and preliminary results point towards the potential importance of government fractionalization in accounting for weakened inter-election responsiveness. In the concluding section we consider implications for our understanding of democratic representation, and also for future research on opinion-policy congruence. </TEXT>

It has been shown that higher levels of subjective well-being lead to greater work productivity, better physical health and enhanced social skills. Because of these positive externalities, policymakers across the world should be interested in attracting and retaining happy and life-satisfied migrants. This paper studies the link between life satisfaction and one's intentions to move abroad. Using survey data from 35 European and Central Asian countries, I find a U-shaped association between life satisfaction and emigration intentions: it is the most and the least life-satisfied people who are the most likely to express intentions to emigrate. This result is found in countries with different levels of economic development and institutional quality. The instrumental variable results suggest that higher levels of life satisfaction have a positive effect on the probability of reporting intentions to migrate. The findings of this paper raise concerns about possible happiness drain in migrant-sending countries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abstract: In this paper I discuss the effectiveness of foreign aid from a historical perspective. I show that foreign aid is a relatively new concept in economics, and I emphasize the role of exchange rate policies in the foreign aid controversies of the 1970s through 1990s. I show that in the early 1980s there were major changes in views regarding aid and agriculture. I emphasize the role of ownership of aid programs by the recipient countries as a way of increasing effectiveness. I argue that there is little hope of making progress in these debates if the economics profession continues to rely, almost exclusively, on cross section regressions. In order to move forward, these analyses need to be supplemented by in depth case studies that follow a country's history for many decades. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abstract: We use the UK Labor Force survey to investigate whether the socio-economic outcomes of people born on the 13th day of the month, and of those born on Friday the 13th, differ from the outcomes of people born on more auspicious days. In many European countries, including the UK, number 13 is considered unlucky and Friday the 13th is seen as an especially unlucky day. We find little evidence that people born on the 13th or those born on Friday the 13th are significantly less likely to be employed, earn lower wages or that they are more likely to stay unmarried compared to people born on other days. </TEXT>
