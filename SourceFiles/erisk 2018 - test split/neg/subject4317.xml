<TEXT> Toot-Toot 5never

But thanks bruh, I guess since it's not psychological or kinda gory like other ones here, the good word sadly can't spread. Maybe I should pull a /r/forwardsfromgrandma and clean it up and have my fanclub send it out, anything to let people know not to toot-toot more than once!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What kind of title is that even? You're probably wondering, well hang tight and give me some space to breath before I tell you about the time I accidently killed this guy. I know right, wait you murdered someone? Yeah, I did, but like Im not some cold-blooded killer, okay? Im actually just another average twelve year old kid.


Some more info about me, so I like going to the movies with my friends and also skateboarding and playing basketball, hell I even volunteer with my mom in our Community Garden on the weekends and also teach those lonely seniors dumped and destined to a life of loneliness at the Senior Centre near my place origami, so I like to think that Ive got some morals and that Im a pretty decent person. 


But the fact remains that is happened and now the medias trying to spin it as some messed up weird teen trend and not some dumb kid who just did something really, really stupid. I mean if you knew the kid who died, and trust me you probably knew someone just like him growing up. Those pain in the ass uber-dweebs who always reminds the teach that they gave you homework or always looking to snitch on you for the dumbest thing, like walking with your shirt untucked or whatever. 


I mean really annoying but pretty minor things like that, but like I said before, Im twelve, so constantly getting detention because and I know you shouldnt speak ill of the dead but Mr. Adam-Can't-Mind-His-Own-Damn-Business-West ( I know what a sick name, right? Totally wasted on this dick) just couldn't keep his stupid mouth shut for one minute, made me think that what I was doing at the time would be a great way to get my revenge on him. 


Honest, hand to God and all that I really didn't expect it to end this way, like seriously honest you gotta believe me! I mean I may have done some kinda mean pranks in my time, but I never really wanted Adam-even if he may have been like a such a dickwad and just also not a nice person to be honest-to die!


Anyway, Ive talked on already a nice bit, so let me get to how this all started. So like a week ago, its Friday and Im at some supermarket in the supermarket near this movie theater picking up some snacks, because movie popcorn is crazy expensive, you get me? 

But yeah, so there I am with twenty five dollars to spend on snacks because this nice old lady who I taught how to make an origami monkey snuck it in my backpack when I wasnt looking, I mean I may not be that rich but Im not gonna take money just for hanging out with someones grandma, trust me those sweet old ladies already pay me enough in cookies and hugs. So Friday night, here I am trying to find small snacks that I can sneak in my pockets, when I accidently end up in the section where they sell all that imported Japanese/Korean sweet stuff. 


I mean I usually never got to try any regular American candy, since my mom works in a bakery so she usually brought like leftover tarts and cupcakes home, so my fatass was ready to try some of this new shit out for the first time, never mind that most of them had nothing on them in English, candys candy no matter the source. So there I am browsing, trying to find what I could get that be the best deal but also just looked like it rot my teeth, a growing boy needs his sugar after all! 

And thats when I spotted them, a pretty small green box with really excited poop cartoons on it. In pretty big red text, that took up most of the space, it said: Toot-Toot, I know, what a name. And on the book were all these words in Korean, Im guessing and like three small cartoons, the first showing a simple cartoon person eating one of the poop candy (Toot-Toot?) and then the next frame giving a thumbs up while farting as some more cartoon faces behind them showed more cartoon people like in agony. Then next cartoon showed the same thing, but from eating two of the Toot-Toots and third showed them eating three, but this time in the next frame giving a big thumbs down and the people around them with Xs for eyes and like sticking their tongues out. 


I dont know man, but I found that shit pretty funny, like a candy that makes you fart and like I mean some really awful smelling ones too? Sign me up for that! So I bought a box, and some other things and ran of to meet my friends, since I didnt wanna miss my movie (it was Ghost God 2: Lucifer's Revenge, such a fucking amazing movie, yo!) And by the end, I decided to try out my new weapon, popping one as the credits rolled, I had barely swallowed it when I felt the pressure rise in my gut, turning to my friends with a smirk, I let out this massive fart that quickly spread to the whole auditorium. Like it was so bad, this one guy sprinted to the exit to hurl in the garbages there, but my friends next to me were hit with the worst of the stench.


Holy Fuck!!


Shit man, shit!


What the fuck Moses? Did you just shit yourself or something? 


And some other choice words, as they turned to look at me like bro-what you smoking? But they quickly found the funny side, once we got outside into the fresh air and I told them about Poot-Poot. 


Man, what will those Japanese guys think of next? Elias laughed, as he held the box up to the light. Nah, El, thats Korean, Paul smacked him on the arm to make that point clear before looking down at his phone as it let out the theme to Ghostbusters. Oh man, its my dad, well catch you guys later! Paul high fived us all and soon after that, Noahs older sis came to get him so it was just me and Elias left. My mom had texted me, saying that she would be there in fifteen and so had Eliass dad, so we were just sitting there eating some nachos and talking about how excited we were for this new game that was coming out next month, when Elias got all quiet and kinda thoughtful looking, which if you knew Elias was way out of the ordinary for him that I immediately got worried, till he turned to me with this grin and a plan. 


How about on Monday, you take another one of those fart candys and let one rip right in Adams face? And my face just as quickly mirrored my best friends face, when I realized what a great idea that was, because see the thing is Adam, being such a snitch had decided to sit right behind me on the first day of class, since me and my friends kinda had this rep for being class clowns, to have the perfect view and chance to get me and my boys in trouble, which really, really had made me dislike him, even more when after Christmas Break, since I had decided New Year, New Me! like my moms magazines were all blasting, to be less of a shit head, mainly since I really did like our teacher, Ms. Goodwin and wanted to give that poor lady some peace and quiet in her final few months of teaching, since she was apparently retiring at the end of year.

Well Adam didnt like that and had started to like kick my chair, and even poke me and just other stupid, dumb shit to get a rise of me, since like I just said, he unfortunately had to sit right behind me. 


It hadnt worked, since I just started watching these videos from some guy called Sifu Smiles on the interwebz and was all about finding my zen and inner peace and other hippie junk like that for January, and I say January, because February I snapped and punched that little shit in the nose right after he decided to go and pick on poor Hana Byrd who sat next to him. Which was a pretty stupid mistake on his part, since like, I mean, I like liked Hana, she was cute and always smelled really nice, like a field of flowers plus her mom was friends with my mom, so we sometime even hung out together which really just made my crush on her even worse.


Like it got really bad when for my birthday she gave me a kiss on the cheek after she handed me my present, so you gotta feel that I may have been a little overprotective of her, especially since her older brother had just died from getting hit by a drunk driver so the poor girl was still pretty broken from that. Plus it kind of gives you a clue on what a piece of shit Adam was, I mean who goes and starts bullying a girl whose brother just died? So yeah, I punched him and some drama later, he still sits behind me but hes a lot more quieter now, thank god too because it meant for me that I could end seventh grade in some peace and quiet. 


Or at least I thought, I had thought, because on this pretty stormy May morning, right as we had all settled in for the first class of the week, Adam just gave me a small smirk before putting up his hand and reminding Ms. Goodwin that we had homework due. 


Oh shit balls, nooooo, I freaked out, but like internally because Im cool like that. I had been so excited from watching that movie on Friday and then because one of my friends had a pool party to celebrate what we had thought been the start of warmer weather on Saturday and then on Sunday I had done my usual origami round down at the senior centre, which by the way ended with me teaching ten people how to make origami penguins! :D So I had kinda lost track of the fact that we had some Math homework to do, which kinda sucked balls, since Im actually pretty decent at like geometry and algebra. 


Elias who sat next to me shot me a panicked look, so I knew he hadnt done his either and Ms. Goodwin was now asking us to pass our papers to front, so I panicked, grabbed my box of Toot-Toot from my backpack and shoved like five of them in my mouth, as I heard an annoyed Hey! from behind me, because yeah no eating in class, whatever Adam, choke on this, I thought, as I stood up and angled my ass to get the best position to his face, and just as I did that the familiar pang in my stomach passed as I let out one of the strongest farts I had ever let rip go through the class. 


Chaos then started, kids and my teach screaming for air, trying to open the windows that had even rattled from just how strong my fart had, while others just started storming out of the door, all in a desperate effort to breath something that had not been contaminated by me. I would have found the whole thing pretty funny, but I was actually still bent at the dumb angle, petrified, like just scared still. Because when I had farted into Adams face, he had immediately gone white as a sheet, and then, and this is the part that really freaked me out, his eyes had rolled up, so only his whites were showing and soon he had collapsed on the ground where he was twitching and kinda like foaming but like bloody fucking foaming, like seriously dudes, I could see blood mixed up with all this other stuff coming out of his mouth.


I freaked the fuck out man, especially since it wasnt just my classroom that had been hit by my body made stink bomb, but the whole school, like everyone was now outside crying and breathing in the rainy air, desperate to feel something hit their nostrils that would get rid of the stench that still lingered, so I was all alone, as my worst enemy silently and painfully from the looks of it died behind me and there was no one to turn to for help, since I had accidently left my phone at home and when I did manage to unfreeze and run out into the school courtyard, no one could go back into the school from just how deadly the smell was. 

It actually wasnt until a couple hours later, when some people in Hazmat suits rolled his dead body, and with it rumours that are probably going to go down in my schools history, people soon started whispering about how he had lost his skin from my fart, that it had been so noxious and toxic it had eaten away at his flesh and some other gory details Im going to not mention, since they made me sick to my core to hear. 


But Im hoping that the more people who know me will hear my side of the story, the more that they realize that this was a harmless prank gone wrong, that really how was I supposed to know that some weird Korean chocolate I had never even heard off, and actually couldnt even find out anything online could cause death, I cant read Korean! But thats where Im hoping you guys can help me, like seriously please if you find that green box with its red font or if you ever get handed one of those poop shaped chocolates, only one Toot-Toot alright! Lets keep our noses and consciences pure shall we? 


Also, despite what Channel Six news might be saying, Im not a member of that weird five sense themed gang and my gang name is for sure not "Silent but Deadly", like at least give me a less dumber nickname and no way am I affiliated with those wackos, like I said before Im just a stupid kid who made an even stupider mistake that I really wish I could take back.   </TEXT>
