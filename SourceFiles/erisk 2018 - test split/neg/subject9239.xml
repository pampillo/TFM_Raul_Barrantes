<TEXT> The Pope forgets the teachings of the Catholic Church. From the Catechism of the Catholic Church: 2241 The more prosperous nations are obliged, to the extent they are able, to welcome the foreigner in search of the security and the means of livelihood which he cannot find in his country of origin. Public authorities should see to it that the natural right is respected that places a guest under the protection of those who receive him.
Political authorities, for the sake of the common good for which they are responsible, may make the exercise of the right to immigrate subject to various juridical conditions, especially with regard to the immigrants' duties toward their country of adoption. Immigrants are obliged to respect with gratitude the material and spiritual heritage of the country that receives them, to obey its laws and to assist in carrying civic burdens.
"To obey its laws..." Entering the U.S. illegally is not obeying it's laws. </TEXT>

So, we are democratic in the sense we each have a vote, and we have representative government (at least we did before liberal judges started legislating from the bench).

<TEXT> You are truly misinformed. Typical for a liberal drone. As Obama said when he withdrew the last Americans troops without securing a Status of Forces agreement, " We leave behind a stable and free Iraq". Because of that fact a power vacuum was created, ripe for the organization of opposing factions like ISIS to infiltrate. So stop trying to rewrite history. An as an American citizen I've lived through the failures of the Obama administration and know just how he's fucked us and the rest of the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think Hillary could have swayed the mid-west. She lost because she couldn't turn out her base. The Republican vote was the same as the last election. A lot of conservatives turned out, but a lot of moderates didn't vote. Some of the Sanders supports voted for Trump, or didn't vote at all. Democrats had 6 millions fewer votes than the last election. A lot of those were the young voters who aren't energized unless you have an aberration running for President. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, that was Hillary's plan and you were okay with that! If fact she said she'd raise taxes on the middle class. As far as Trump is concerned, when he's been President a full year, then he can see his taxes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one liberal request I'll never understand. The practice of politicians releasing tax returns started to see what kind of people were donating to the politicians, to determine if some kind of quid pro quo was going on. Sort of like the Clinton Foundation contributions for State favors. But Trump was never a politician before. There is nothing to see. Stop the madness. Get over the election. You lost. You're just trying to muddy the waters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, this is the good part. We divorced just before the housing market bubble burst. I was paying attention. We owed $270K on the house, but it was valued at $620K. I knew that was way high, so taking advantage of her greed I told her if she refinanced and gave me $125K the house was hers. I got her to sign off my pension in the divorce. She's now remarried, so she doesn't get any of my Social Security. She recently sold the house and only broke even. She ran up her credit card debt to $80K and just lost her six figure government job. She want's to retire, but her new husband said not until she pays off her credit card debt. I've been retired 7 years now and enjoying all my hard earned benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked for a Theatre group in the 70's, and the answer then is no. Most theatres had one screen. They used arc projectors with positive and negative electrodes burning to make the light. That's why film would burn up if the projector jammed. They use lots of electricity. The projectors each had their own chimneys to vent the heat. Projection rooms were always hot. When we'd get only a few people for a film, the manager would apologize and refund their money. Just not cost effective. </TEXT>

Democrats: Are now Socialists that believe in a system where all property is controlled by a small group of individuals. They determine what the common good will be and force everyone else to comply.
Republicans: Believe in Capitalism, a system where people keep what they earn and trade voluntarily for what they need. Individuals are left to pursue their own agendas so long as they don't directly harm others. </TEXT>
