<TEXT> Related to Canadian Politics specifically regarding international push back on trade treaties: 

 A trade deal between the European Union and hardly threatening Canada was almost scuppered by a recalcitrant Belgian province concerned about the effects of globalization on local workers.

Globally sentiments are turning away from globalization, open borders and trade, towards strengthening national identities. 

From /u/mymainmannoamchomsky in /r/economics: 

Two interesting passages that get to the crux of the issue here:

In the beginning of the article:

 It used to be generally accepted that reducing trade barriers increases prosperity and promotes peace, benefiting investing and recipient countries and promoting international cooperation in solving problems around the world.

And at the end of the article:

 In recent years we have also commenced a race to the bottom in areas like labor standards, environmental protections and capital requirements for banks. Businesses evade stiffer rules by moving elsewhere, hindering national aspirations to improve in these areas. The remedy is international dialogue directed at establishing global minimum standards, harmonizing approaches.

We were sold the first: Comparative advantage will increase output - it's an economic fact - both countries will be far better off as firms use the particular advantages of their home economy and specialize.
But really it was the latter: Countries used "global trade" as a way to transcend the rules of any particular nation. The free trade ended up being an apple plant assembling phones in China shipping to Apple US who sells the phones. Multi-nationals traded with themselves (which is basically arbitrage, not trade). </TEXT>

Thinking of workarounds, the best I can come up with is physical submissions could hypothetically shuffled and tallied after-the-fact, and electronic submissions could simply be recorded without submitter data to an independent server than tax submission.

<TEXT>  This will have a disenfranchising effect on the poor, and individuals who are traditionally less likely to file tax returns, as they have far less to gain from it.

I'd mentioned this in a comment above, but if Basic Income ever takes off it will be necessary to ensure that low-income and impoverished individuals are in the Revenue Canada system. If there's a political soft-referendum element to tax submissions, I suspect there would be a much stronger organized effort to engage these individuals rather than simply letting them fall through the cracks, which is what we currently do.

 Moreover, it moves tax returns into a direction that requires more from people. Tax returns need to be far easier, and ideally, should be as pre-filled out as possible for individuals to receive the maximum amount of returns possible.

This is a fair point, but asking people to fill out a couple of multiple-choice questions separate from their personal return isn't exactly making the return itself more complicated. 

 It's an idea that's good in theory, but really, at the end of the day, we have a representative democracy for a reason, and I'd prefer a group of chosen individuals be making decisions while in constant consultations with their constituents.

Again, a fair point; however, it would generate a fascinating set of additional data on the sentiments of Canadians to inform our representative democracy's decision making.

<TITLE> [Policy Idea] Conducting "soft" referendums through annual Income Tax submissions to Revenue Canada? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-03 17:48:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought I'd throw this out there as a topical policy idea for discussion on whether there's an easier way than full-out referendums to get direct feedback from the electorate on sticky policy issues.

Sometimes the question of whether an administration has a proper mandate from the electorate to make a major reform can be difficult to resolve. Particularly when the issue at hand is whether an administration selected by one electoral system has a clear mandate to change to a new electoral system. Obvious conflicts of interest there...

It's a fair point that a referendum from the electorate might be the only proper method to change the entire system of how Canadians select elected representatives.  However, there's a real danger that if the current government goes through with a referendum and the electorate chooses to maintain the status quo, that's a lot of political capital burnt to achieve nothing. 

Similarly, during an election parties have massive policy platforms, and while the electorate might agree with a large proportion of a party's policy agenda, there may be several issues where a plurality of Canadians would prefer something else. 

Questions of whether ~~the mob~~ the electorate should take too great a hand directly in the selection of policy and governance notwithstanding, it would be nice to have some clear polling data on where most Canadians stand on certain issues. 

**Therefore, be it resolved:** 

**Would it be useful to have a section in Canadian's income tax returns where they could make selections on desired policy initiatives. Basically, annual 'soft' referendum questions, without the pageantry and expense of full-out polling places, ballots, volunteers, etc.**

Good idea? Terrible idea? </TEXT>

Personally, I'd recommend hiring more cooperative education employees for short-term roles within the ministries and give them a mandate of developing simple efficiency improvements to systems during their placements. 

Another option (not mutually exclusive) would be to set up an interdepartmental competition for developing improvements. 

The hard part would be driving adoption if anyone actually developed anything useful... </TEXT>

These senators really aren't answerable to anyone during their service, so hopefully the only things that will motivate them to stand in the way of legislation progressing are genuine convictions towards making it better. 

I'm also generally very pessimistic, but I have a lot of hope for this reform. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, it's less about "salary" when you're in business for yourself, because the success of the company is your success. 

Also, agreed, you can't really do conventional "engineering" jobs as a business without a license. However, anything conventional is going to be a saturated market where you wouldn't be able to compete without a ton of experience anyway.

The key is to find a real problem that doesn't have a good solution, and then build an organization to offer a solution (or more simply, make 'something' that people want), business and work will follow. 

Further, you can still gain expertise, and depending on where you're working and who you're working with, you can still gain expertise towards gaining a license. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just last night, I finished reading Pathfinder by Orson Scott Card. 

It was pretty cool, and offered a nice bridge between Sci-Fi and Fantasy tropes. Also the theme of how time is experienced (and could be manipulated) was pretty interesting. It reminded me a little of reading a Brandon Sanderson story in the sense of there being a pretty cool world and premise governed by a system of rules that the characters are bound within. 

Time travel is pretty complicated though, and Orson Scott Card is a little hand-wavey with some of the paradoxes. Also, the main character is a little too exceptional in his personal capabilities. However, all in all, I enjoyed it a lot.

I'll probably keep reading the rest of the trilogy.

As an aside, this was also the first book that I acquired from a "little library" on someone's lawn, while walking around California, so that was pretty sweet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the US with Obamacare they've made a lot of impressive strides towards paying providers based on patient outcomes rather than fee-for-service.  i.e. healthcare providers get paid more when people get home and get better without needing to be re-admitted. Instead of getting paid more if a patient gets a post-operative surgical complication or hospital-associated infection that keeps them bed-ridden for 3 months. 

If the insurance is public, i.e. single-payer, and set up with incentives for standard of care instead of fee for service, healthcare outcomes will improve. 

Also, right now in Canada we mostly have fee-for-service despite it being a publicly delivered.  We don't pay providers for better patient outcomes. They're paid more in some ways to persist in being inefficient.

Keep in mind, I'm not saying people should be able to go and use their own money to purchase healthcare services.  I'm saying keep the public insurance, but lose the notion that delivery of that service should also be a public institution.  Also, have a strong regulatory component so that the delivery of those services is still held under the microscope. </TEXT>

Being able to produce large quantities of hamburger meat (or whatever meat) straight from cells is going to be safer from a QA perspective (fewer chance of prions, etc.), be a comparatively minuscule footprint, cheaper in the long run.  Probably taste identical.

<TEXT> It would be interesting to have a regular poll of scientists and economists for ranking the acceptability of policy decisions.

Personally, I would prefer to know what the people who know the most think of the policies that politicians are pushing.

Some opinions shift dramatically when you have expertise in a particular area. For instance the average person, if they go into cardiac arrest, or a family member does, want physicians to do everything they can to save them.  However, a [startlingly low number of medical physicians desire the same attempts at resuscitation for themselves](http://ideas.time.com/2012/01/16/what-doctors-know-and-we-can-learn-about-dying/?xid=gonewsedit google_editors_picks=true) if they go into cardiac arrest, many getting "no code" tattoos or medallions, and signing advance DNR orders.  

  Only about 8% of people who go into cardiac arrest outside of the hospital are revived by CPR. Even when your heart stops in the hospital, you have only a 19% chance of surviving.

Given the choice, many physicians elect to forgo the violent medical interventions that many of their patients are given.

A lot of policy is written with the best of intentions and ends up being a nightmare in its execution. </TEXT>

You're right that it is necessary, the same way members of the judiciary don't stand up in public advocating one set of gov't policies over another, as the perception of neutrality is important to maintain.

It occurred to me that under a hypothetical scenario where a government is abusing their mandate to the detriment of the country, such that members of the civil service feel the need to offer public protest or dissent, **the only suitable protest is to resign**. </TEXT>

That being said, the reason why everyone goes to Silicon Valley to get funded is because there's a ton of money being thrown around, to the point where they're calling it a startup valuation bubble.

Rest assured, there will be a surplus. However, if something goes really wrong with the economy, like say the collapse of the housing market, the gov't will be running the severe risk of gloating about something nobody cares about anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If Mr. Harper is going to be launching attacks, he needs to be doing so in a manner that actually hits the both of them.

This is actually really important.  While strategically attacking Mulcair does little for the CPC, by only attacking the Liberals and Justin, it's easy for them to come off as bullies that are picking on what is becoming the underdog in the race.  

Canadians like Justin.  They might not want him for PM, but he's a Canadian icon that voters aren't going to want to see dragged through the mud when he's already in 3rd place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My assumption is that potential conservative swing voters are only shared between the conservatives and the liberals.  Similarly, potential NDP swing voters are only shared between the NDP and the liberals. 

If the NDP continue to perform well in the polls, it will pull support from their shared swing voters with the Liberals.  This loss of support will discourage the conservative swing voters from voting Liberal and stick with the conservatives.

A strong NDP actually boosts the conservatives ability to aggregate their support in the election, because nobody wants to vote for a losing party, no matter how good their policies might look.  The green party is a good example of this (minus their fringe policy problems). </TEXT>

Right now, I feel like I'm in TO watching the maple leafs or something...

The LPC has SO MANY popular policy positions they could have announced. Announcing them all at once like this, unless you're a wonk, or a politics addict, it's probably just more noise than signal, and that won't overcome negative attack ads.

<TEXT> I was basically in your shoes 10 years ago.  I actually only applied to engineering at one school out of all the programs that I applied to.  It was probably the best decision I ever made though, because there was a really good coop program where you could go and work in different industries and see what you liked.  

So I did oil   gas, automotive, pharmaceuticals, etc.  You quickly figure out what you're interested in and what you're not.  I actually moved out to Calgary and worked for a few years after I graduated too.  I eventually decided I wanted to do something a little more on the frontier of science, so I went back and I've since been researching ways to improve a class of protein-based cancer therapies.  

The point is, you want to do something that will keep as many doors open as possible so you can figure out what you actually like.  

Also, do an exchange term if you get a chance, go to Japan or Germany or somewhere, I really missed the boat on that.

Also, don't get a science degree unless you're passionate about getting into research and academia (no offense to any science majors reading). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It must be different... I can't imagine there being enough diluent available to move regular bitumen from Alberta to the gulf coast.  

Bitumen is a pretty all encompassing term, there must be some pre-treatment involved, but probably not full-out upgrading.  I looked up a couple papers after my first comment, which said that it is common to use some special alloys and polyurethane coating to extend the lifespan of the line.  However, I recall hearing about pipeline-sections that had to be replaced in a matter of months out there, and that's just not realistic for a continent-spanning pipeline (I would think anyway).

<TEXT> IMHO, whether or not they occurred at low points they were a reflection of character, and not necessarily even positive character, but a willingness to be adversarial and put up a fight.

Politics is about a conflict of ideas and ideologies, and it takes a certain toughness to be a leader and take a stand. Any time you watch Mulcair in QP, the guy is not taking no for an answer, he won't be cowed. 

To quote Gene Hackman, "It's about putting a brick through the other guy's windshield. I'm talking about taking it out and chopping it up." 

Maybe Trudeau is rope-a-doping right now and this is all strategy... After all, if the CPC redirect all their resources at Mulcair and he comes out swinging fast enough to win people over, he'll come out on top. However, I don't think politics works quite like boxing, it's an awfully big risk to run a campaign of blandness with the hope that you'll be too boring to criticize.

Justin should've stuck to his guns, wilting and walking off with his tail between his legs just made him look weak to all the voters that were ready to give him a chance.  

Sometimes you say fuddle duddle, or give a guy a Shawinigan handshake.  Being a Liberal is about grit, that's what liberal voters respond to.  It's pretty heartbreaking watching the LPC over-manage Justin and basically ruin his potential as a politician.  

Even his most recent announcement about tax cuts for the middle class was like watching someone doped up on Valium.  No passion, just some soulless script...

He needs to accept that he's going to occasionally say things that don't play well in the media and get over it.  The liberals can't run a campaign on "Let's go back to 10 years ago".  They need to have new vibrant ideas like kicking all the senators out of caucus, continue to take risks and own the centre.  

It's not about filing a giant policy platform that the average voter won't read, it's about injecting some healthy populism and criticism of the current administration and offering a better vision of the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For an analysis piece, this seems to lack any real cohesive point.  However, one related aspect that would be interesting to consider is that we're moving towards an economy where conventional labour is disappearing and the concept of a 'job' and livelihood is shifting.  

Some jobs remain in high demand today, including many trades, but it's not crazy to assume that in the next 10 years an effective welding robot will emerge, or that most construction will be conducted by prefabricating and assembling the components in place.  "Disruptive" technology has already become an irritating though accurate buzzword to describe many other economic sectors that are getting upended. 

I don't want to sound like an Isaac Asimov book report, but the reality is that we're approaching a time where the greatest human commodity will be creativity and enormous resources will be available to make whatever we desire.  Companies and ventures will still exist, but like Larry Smith's point in the article, the only thing anyone will bother working for are the things they really care about.

I don't imagine some dystopia where jobs have disappeared and where we all live in poverty with no money, but rather a future where resources to do anything are in such large supply that the cost of doing them is minute, and as a result whatever you want to do, you literally can go do.  

It's difficult to imagine, especially considering that poverty continues to exist unabated today, but I like to think Canada could lead the way in shifting towards supporting smaller cheaper ventures with a better social safety net, and less reliance on trying to hang on to big companies that employ thousands of "workers".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doing a PhD can be pretty rewarding, I'm still trying to wrap up mine. I don't know if RMC has one, but if I was going to give some advice to myself at the beginning of grad school, it would be to take a course on Design of Experiments (DOE). It will save you some pain. Also, try to become disciplined about writing and how to prepare manuscripts for publication as early as possible.

Also, good luck! If you end up out in KW come have a beer with Dillon and I. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's this classic movie from 1939 called "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" starring Jimmy Stewart made by Frank Capra, great movie. It popularized the whole idea of filibustering in the US Senate.  The main character is this guy who gets appointed to fill the seat of a deceased US Senator.  He's not a politician, just a normal guy, but he stands by his convictions to make sure some bad legislation doesn't happen.

Regarding Trudeau, people don't expect him to be brilliant (visionary), but generally speaking think he's a good guy that will stand up for what he believes in, like multiculturalism, justice, etc.

I don't think he can pull off visionary statesman, but he can pull off a bit of justified firebrand populism.  Don't just claim to fight for the middle class, fight for all Canadians, and not with some nebulous rhetoric. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   It has nothing to do with technology. Governments are the most democratic when they are closer to the people.

I'm all in favour of municipal level politics remaining local, but I would argue that the size of our country coupled with the how small our population is is an excellent reason why ridings make little sense as a basis of government when we're all more connected online.  

At a federal level, I have much more in common constituently with /u/Borror0 or /u/palpz even though they're on opposite sides of the country than my neighbours that I've never met or associated with.  

The entire /r/CanadaPolitics subreddit is a reasonably sized and arguably more representative community to exercise federal representation than some arbitrarily drawn geographical basis.

Some rural areas might still exercise a geographical representation given the choice, but by and large Canadian citizens are more connected by other mechanisms than where they happen to live. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The best way to do that is through the investment of government dollars in public goods. Rather than spending on often poorly targeted subsidies, instead we should make investments in our cash starved universities, daycare/early childhood education, and improved care for chronic mental and physical illnesses.

I really like this idea, though I would include the idea of broadening the mandate of libraries.  Public libraries are already essential community tools for helping people reeducate and return to the workforce.  However, as electronic media becomes more ubiquitous, the focus of libraries can change to include concepts like hackerspaces for developing new ideas and technologies outside of universities.  Several countries are already [moving in this direction](http://www.npr.org/2011/12/10/143401182/libraries-make-room-for-high-tech-hackerspaces). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting, so would you say that the current SCC spends a greater proportion of its time on modern legislation than previous courts? This is perhaps more related to the challenges that are brought to it, but I'd be curious whether a lot of pre-Charter low hanging fruit has already been taken care of, such that now the SCC is caught up and focuses a greater amount of time on legislation as it is being passed by parliament. 

The latter would mean that even the next administrations will face greater scrutiny of their policy, and it's little to do with the current government.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The cause of the loss of manufacturing in Canada is kind of a moot point, and an excuse to point fingers at the West, as though they shouldn't be trying to extract and produce their resources.  

I would prefer to see an article on potential directions that manufacturing in Quebec and Ontario could go.  It seems like most of the big investment to date has been in propping up flagging industries that were ultimately leaving anyway.  Canada is a developed economy, if we don't want to be replaced by developing countries who are advancing their own manufacturing capabilities, we have to have an eye to the next decade, not the previous one. </TEXT>

CHAPPiE was actually pretty good! It didn't feel disorganized, I was emotionally connected to the characters. I caught some of the subtext that Chappie was a foil for every person who comes into this world. Plus, I liked where it went, it wasn't totally formulaic, and the action was good.

<TEXT> I really thought this would be a different article from the title.  The entrepreneurship scene can definitely be a bit of a cult, with people drowning in their own Koolaid like they've joined a pyramid scheme.  I've personally known people to pitch ideas for startups that sound great, win a bunch of money, and then roll-up the company like con-artists disappearing to enjoy their free lunch.  Or worse, the concept defies the laws of physics and none of the judges dolling out money have a highschool level understanding of thermodynamics.

Those are some negatives of the entrepreneurship culture going on in Canada and elsewhere.

The positives are it's an enormously rewarding education even if your venture doesn't get off the ground.  I've seen several small groups of people start with a problem and conceive a relatively clever solution and a few years later their team is tripled, they have operating capital, and they've made something cool and useful that people are willing to pay for.  In good faith trying to scale a solution to a real world problem.  Even if it hasn't gotten off the ground, they notice a different problem, build a new team, and iterate their knowledge, avoiding the mistakes they made the first time.  Investing in that sort of education in Canada isn't a waste of money, it pays dividends in metrics that are still being conceived.

Entrepreneurship is risky in the sense that you don't have the kind of income security that lets you pay down a mortgage, makes you worried about getting married, or trying to have a family.  But honestly, there's a generation of people now who don't feel that sense of security in a regular job anyway.  With a feeling like there isn't much to lose, I think Canada is heading for a very innovative time for startups provided they don't all leave to America because all the investors here are chickenshit scared to be the first to sign a term sheet. </TEXT>

2. There can only be seven Chandrian, therefore when there are rumors early in the story of a 'new' Chandrian, this is actually Denna who has fully joined Haliax's team and gone to the dark side after Kvothe kills Cinder.


3. Kvothe is ultimately able to open his thrice-locked chest with the help of Auri, who understands seemingly inanimate objects so intimately that she's the only who who is able to make it 'right' so that is will open.

<TEXT> The subject of electoral reform and proportional representation has been in the news and on this sub fairly often leading in to this 2015 election year.

I've often felt that one of the benefits of first-past-the-post was that its tendency towards majority governments at least provided for a lot of legislation to be passed, unlike PR legislatures that suffer more gridlock appeasing several parties at once.

However, if the ease of passing legislation means we must wait for legal challenges from private citizens and the courts to remove poorly conceived laws (i.e. unconstitutional legislation), then I don't know if I wouldn't support moving to a more PR system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much.  Plus, shale oil does not yield high production long term.  The US is temporarily a major exporter of oil gas.  Alberta has a much longer-term supply.  The question is whether prior to the drop in US production energy alternatives will rise enough to yield a long term 'drop' in oil prices.  

If Alberta can get it's pipelines down in time for when the price of oil  likely rises again, it will have a fairly sustainable revenue stream from harvesting bitumen IMHO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, PM me after Christmas if you're still interested, I think my housemate is going to try it with me and split the bill. (economies of scale for the win)

I assume you also started off with this website - [DIY Soylent](http://diy.soylent.me/) - that /u/WhyAmISuchAJerk already posted one recipe from in this thread, and there are about a hundred specifically Canadian recipes on there to date it looks like. 

Most of the recipes have fewer than 15 ingredients total, and they cover your basics: protein, carbs, fats, vitamins, minerals

The fewer the total ingredients, the better **$/day** (generally)

My goal is to start with a fairly basic recipe just to start out and then find some decent flavors to work in.  I've heard mixing with coffee is okay for breakfast, but I wouldn't mind trying one with a frozen fruit component (since frozen fruit is relatively cheap, flavourful and lasts).

I am curious whether there's a way to make hot meals with soylent that won't be completely gross...

<TEXT>  Professional assessment of each clinical situation should be based on guidelines developed in light of up-to-date evidence-based data. Until such consensual guidelines are developed, the Commissioner believes that clinics should adopt a moratorium on IVF for women over the age of 42 who wish to use their own eggs. This age limit was proposed by an expert committee in Ontario and is already used in a number of clinics in Qubec.

Interesting, so because professional guidelines have not yet been released to physicians the province wants to try and pass legislation?

If practitioners in the majority of cases agree to follow a guideline not to perform certain medical procedures given certain conditions, that's a much simpler way to handle this than trying to pass laws to the same effect.

I have a running theory on this with /u/dmcg12 that rather than abolish the monarchy we should just make QEII our monarch in perpetuity, even after she is deceased, which would effectively end our monarchy, but retain our heritage. 

However, I do think having the PM be the head of the executive and simultaneously the head of the legislative bodies of Canada leads to inherent conflict of responsibility. So, I would also want some kind of reform to the office of the Governor General.  

That being said, I don't know if being a republic instead of a constitutional monarchy would really mean that much in the scheme of things for the future of Canada... </TEXT>

However, I can't help wondering, what's next for us?

Looking at the world as it exists today, what is something Canada is well-positioned to innovate and lead the rest of the world on?

There was a questionnaire posted recently to members of the Liberal party, and there was [some discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/2nopvn/does_a_quiz_recently_sent_out_by_the_liberal/) about whether the LPC was trying to craft some kind of election narrative for 2015.  Personally, I found the topics somewhat boring.  

I wondered if I was alone in wanting to feel more inspired by the direction of my country.  Is it enough that we live in a developed, moderate democracy, with high standard of living.  Or, should we collectively be more ambitious?

Personally, I feel like we should be doing more, though I feel at a bit of a loss for what that 'more' ought to be.  </TEXT>

While a 900 is pretty sweet, and I would have loved to try it at some point, there is plenty of NMR research, even in solid-state, being conducted in several labs across the country.

I'll agree it is stupid to make the investment and then shut the facility down for pennies on the dollar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If anything, it's a less ideological and pragmatic decision (in most instances) to stop funding programs like this.  Especially as you noted in  your earlier comment that it's more of a provincial jurisdiction anyway.  

I don't mean to come out on the side of slashing programs, but new programs are introduced all the time, they either become essential public goods and politically untenable to remove (universal healthcare), or they become expendable.  

You're right though, these programs start as a manifestation of political ideological will, and end more typically as a pragmatic fiscal decision.  Granted, in this case the fiscal decision is also ideological, but what isn't partially ideological in politics... </TEXT>

Yes, I am joking (and laughing, sorry), but you have to admit if you're going to unfairly tax a demographic, it might as well be the one that refuses to exercise political power.

 On a separate note, why do you call it a "privilege" not to vote

I would argue that everyone has the right to vote. However, living in a country like Canada, with laws, stability, checks and balances, such that not voting won't yield much in the way of consequences and therefore choosing not to vote is a priviledge.

 Question: do you think that low voter turnout is the problem or a symptom of the problem?

I don't know if I'd categorize it as a symptom. As I said, I think those who don't vote are exercising a privilege to be lazy and not register an opinion, even if that opinion is *none of the above*. I think lack of satisfaction with the options is just an excuse to remain uninformed and not take responsibility for unpopular electoral outcomes. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  To me, remembrance Day becomes derailed when people wear the white poppy. The people who wear the white poppy or who support it are hijacking remembrance day and pushing a political agenda. Regardless of their intentions.

I don't disagree with you, but I'm equally concerned about how Remembrance Day itself can often be hijacked for political narratives to encourage nationalism and nostalgia through glorified representations of Canada in the early 20th century.  

 But if Nazi Germany cannot be considered evil then what can? Nazi Germany and their atrocious are the literal definition of evil.

While Nazi Germany is probably the best example of evil that the average person can call to mind.  I feel like it's too often an excuse to view the world in black and white.  The west and its allies were 'good guys' and axis powers were all 'bad guys'; when really we shook hands with the devil in Stalin and committed plenty of atrocities defeating the Germans and Japanese.  

Overall, the actions of the west and its allies were necessary and justified, but the narrative we subscribe to remembering these events is a little too forgiving.  Monstrosities were committed to defeat monsters.

As an adult, I can acknowledge that WWII was probably as bad or worse, than the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and its simply difference of media available that shifts how we choose to remember these events that we get to feel like 'good guys' for WWII.  

However, that 'good guys' narrative is too easily exploited even today to convince large electorates to take up violent international conflicts, such as when the US invaded Iraq, by portraying Saddam Hussein as a Hitler of the middle east, with ties to 9/11.

I'm comforted by some of the other descriptions ITT for how individuals focus on the terrible sacrifice of Canadians when they wear the poppy. That our hands are never clean, no matter how pure the intentions going in... </TEXT>

If we were going to build a system of government from scratch with all the technology, information, and even political philosophy available today, I think it's unlikely we would settle on parliamentary democracy.  I would further extend this to our judicial institutions, and really any public institution.  

Still, I don't know if direct democracy would necessarily be the answer either.  Though it would be very interesting to have regular national referendums (coupled with convenient voting schemes) rather than relying on elected representatives to vote on our behalf.  We could even still have elected representatives to submit and debate legislation...

Something that concerns me is that the Ottawa shooter [attempted to get a passport](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-shooting-michael-zehaf-bibeau-wanted-libyan-passport-1.2811768), and the Quebec hit-and-run murderer had [his passport revoked](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/martin-couture-rouleau-hit-and-run-driver-arrested-by-rcmp-in-july-1.2807078).  Both were prevented from travelling. Both were known to police and wanted to leave the country, and only barring that committed acts of domestic terrorism.  

If the police had the foresight to prevent these men from traveling, is there some other intervention, currently outside the bounds of the law (not necessarily detention or incarceration), that might have prevented both incidents?

(and future incidents for that matter...)

You could have a media embedding program for instance, where reporters and the intelligence apparatus work in cooperation (and under the supervision of a judicial arbiter) to declassify and inform the public within 5 years (or by election cycle) of operations executed.

<TEXT> Totally true, from a public safety perspective, such an apparatus is in the public good I would concur.

Also, from a slightly more pragmatic perspective, understanding how the global economy is shifting, and positioning Canada to benefit the most based on the best information and analysis of foreign nations and transnational conglomerates is also important. 

After all, fairly recently a [certain Canadian enterprise](http://business.financialpost.com/2014/10/01/snc-riadh-ben-aissa-pleads-guilty/) was committing illegal actions behind closed doors with the Gaddafis in Libya. (Presumably not in the best interests of the Canadian state).

I wouldn't condone us training agents to violate the sovereign laws of other nations and steal intellectual property, but having first-hand data and analysis of foreign economies and the activities of large corporations impacting the global economy is invaluable.

I totally agree with this, though I do wonder whether a judicial court is the appropriate means to establish ethical practices.  It's certain an essential means of enforcing against breaches. However, I feel like as soon as you try to establish a system of rules, it will be imperfect, and loop-holes will begin to be exploited. 

I would prefer that beyond typical judicial checks, that the intelligence and diplomatic communities would establish codes of professional conduct, and bodies for peer oversight, similar to how engineers, doctors and other professional groups keep their members in check.

This might be a naive proposal, but I think it could be a simple and effective means to cultivate an appropriate culture for a future intelligence community.

<TEXT>  It's the very definition of moving the goalpost.

One could argue that democracy and the law itself are moving goal posts...

After all, if something becomes unpopular leading to protest, which leads to a change in gov't administration, and then a change in regulation, then maintaining a mandate even only locally to a public project is an important reality.

For me, the more interesting question goes back to Spock: 

*"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one."*  

So, if a government possesses a national mandate, but fails to secure a local mandate, like in the case of the bitumen pipelines, are they still secure in pressing ahead with development?

I suppose the answer depends on the strength of the national mandate.  A good example is probably when P.E. Trudeau enacted the NEP against Alberta. </TEXT>

Isn't [civil disobedience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience) (i.e. protest) by its definition a means to undermine laws or practices that are perceived as an injustice?

From wikipedia: *"Civil disobedience is the active, professed refusal to obey certain laws, demands, or commands of a government, or of an occupying international power."*

 Their influence no more undermines the law than unions, business associations, or any other organized group that pleads a case to government.

The law is a tangible piece of work that is meant to approximate a perfect legal contract of compromise between all groups in society as a whole.  Depending on the level of disparity between the actual law, and 'what it ought to be' for perceived social justice, is the foundation of public protest isn't it? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  overly simplistic and immature world view

Acknowledging the limitations of Canada's current military and its ability to make a real contribution in a combat role is the mature action here. So is supporting the overall mission in real ways instead of 'sending the best we got', which is so obviously eclipsed by the militaries of our allies who haven't cut defense spending as deeply as we have.

<TEXT> My issue, and it's admittedly somewhat off-topic from the point of Coyne's article, is 'what happens after?'

I feel like it's an illusion that western nations can sweep into destabilized foreign countries, dumping money and resources, to defeat some group taking power, and then somehow encourage nation building or win hearts and minds...

I'm **not** saying do nothing. But just bull-dozing into Iraq and Syria (and back into Afghanistan when the Taliban takes over again) without a long-term sustainable strategy seems like folly.

We can't just prop up a minimally western-friendly corrupt government and expect the region to stabilize. </TEXT>

I'm inclined to agree.  I wonder if there is anything in the criminal code regarding actions taken outside of Canada, so international jurisdictions.  For instance, if it was made illegal to engage in militant and other activities with foreign organizations for purposes contrary to the will of the Canadian state, then there could be a standing warrant for his arrest issued... 

Under these circumstances, his passport could be rescinded, rather than simply stripping him and others like him of citizenship, which comes off as an unwillingness of us to clean up our own messes.  

Furthermore, for intelligence purposes, given appropriate intervention and leverage, some of these people make for potential assets for undermining ISIS from within. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This passage reminds me of a poem by Neruda I was telling a friend of mine about the other day, "October Fullness":

*Poco a poco y tambin mucho a mucho
me sucedi la vida
y qu insignificante es este asunto:
estas venas llevaraon
sangre ma que pocas veces vi,
respire el aire de tantas regiones
sin guardarme una muestra de ninguno
y a fin de cuentas ya lo saben todos: 
nadie se lleva nada de su haber
y la vida fue un prstamo de huesos.
Lo bello fue aprender a no saciarse
de la tristeza ni de la alegra,
esperar el tal vez de una ltima gota,
pedir ms a la miel y a las tinieblas.*


**English Translation**:
*Little by little, and also in great leaps,
life happened to me,
and how insignificant this business is.
These veins carried
my blood, which I scarcely ever saw,
I breathed the air of so many places
without keeping a sample of any.
In the end, everyone is aware of this:
nobody keeps any of what he has,
and life is only a borrowing of bones.
The best thing was learning not to have too much
either of sorrow or of joy,
to hope for the chance of a last drop,
to ask more from honey and from twilight.*

The poem has more passages and offers a little more optimism to feeling like a life is more than insignificance, even if that means you have to crave experiences for your own self-gratification. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  instead of constantly attacking Conservatives

Generally speaking, there's a distinction between attacking the actions and policies of one's opponents (fair game), rather than attacking people and character (negative ads).

That being said, I saw Trudeau's speech at UW this past week, and an interesting thing happened. Justin made a slightly unfair criticism that immediately got a lot of applause from the students, but then immediately said to the crowd, "don't applaud that... partisan attack..." 

So, while he's campaigning and stumping and playing the game, I appreciate that he has a certain distaste for 'going negative' on his opponents.

<TEXT> Haha, I don't know if I wouldn't call myself a schmoe either, but as an example of how you could work with Ebola material that is inherently non-dangerous.  There was this story from a few years back of a [guy trying to smuggle](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/winnipeg-researcher-charged-with-smuggling-ebola-material-into-u-s-1.774725) Ebola-related research samples out of Canada's Lv4 Lab in Winnipeg.  While the prospect was scary, it was determined that what he'd stolen could never be used for bioterrorism because:

 Dr. Frank Plummer, the scientific director of the Winnipeg lab, said the genetic material taken was not the full Ebola virus and does not pose a risk to the public.

As I understand it, and this is purely speculation on my part, for viruses that have a habit of mutating rapidly (HIV, ebola), or other viruses where a seasonal variant can be very different year to year (influenza): while their exterior structures will change a lot making it difficult for our immune systems to detect or remember them, sometimes they possess a common trait across their various mutations.  

[Seth Berkley](http://youtu.be/nncPtxLCPrE) gives a great TED talk here about modern vaccine technologies currently being commercialized.  In the talk he uses the analogy looking at influenza that it might be wearing different clothes season to season, but it's always wearing the same socks, and that's how a universal vaccine could be developed.   

So, live virus might be very important for some aspect of research related to making a universal ebola vaccine, but it might be easier to expedite treatments that target the characteristics that are subject to change (this is risky though, as you could end up with something completely ineffective...)

That being said, in that talk by Seth Berkley, he explains why it would never be possible to use a strategy like this for influenza with our current process involving making the vaccine in chicken eggs.  However, with the alternative process he describes, rapid virus-like particle (VLP) therapeutics might be possible.  The company Protein Sciences that make Flublok effectively do this for seasonal influenza.

All that being said, it sounds like there's been [some success](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-29076371) developing ebola vaccines since the first outbreak, so hopefully they can turn around human trials fairly quickly for it. </TEXT>

These can be protein-only, completely non-infectious and safe to work with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Saw this posted in another [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2fpi2y/the_scientist_leading_britains_response_to_the/ckbnmv3) for this article, but Adrian Hill the researcher noted in the title responded to this article:

This article claims that I, Adrian Hill, have  launched a devastating attack on Big Pharm, accusing drugs giants including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Sanofi, Merck and Pfizer of failing to manufacture a vaccine, not because it was impossible, but because there was no business case. I did no such thing.
I simply explained to Mr Cooper what is widely known in the biomedical research and development community: that vaccine development is extremely expensive, usually takes a very long time and the market is dominated by some very large pharma companies. Because outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola are rare and unpredictable and, until now, have afflicted small numbers of people in very poor countries, it is widely understood that that is no business case for a private company to invest tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in vaccine development for such diseases. It may be the Independents view that this is a telling indictment of the global pharmaceutical industry, but it is not mine and I am unhappy that the first paragraph of this report wrongly attributes that view to me.
Developing drugs and vaccines for diseases of low-income countries is an enormous challenge but one where there has been substantial progress over the last decade. The problem, that this report presents as news, is not new to the large numbers of governments and agencies working to tackle this area, including many product development partnerships set up to try and develop and provide vaccines for neglected diseases. In most cases the solution involves more public and charitable foundation investment in early stage research and partnerships with industry for late stage product development.
While most of us would like to see even more industry engagement in these endeavours one should also acknowledge the important contributions made by several major pharma companies despite the lack of a business case for investment (e.g. GSK in malaria and Novartis in typhoid vaccine development). GSK is an important contributor to the current effort on Ebola vaccines. The simplistic opportunism of taking a new understanding of these longstanding challenges to discredit the global vaccine industry is unfortunate. To ascribe that view incorrectly to me, when I was simply explaining the problem and not attributing blame, is very poor journalism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd actually like to see the %GDP defense spending normalized per capita or per size of military to determine if Canada is actually spending a 'fair' amount with respect to other NATO allies.

After all, 2%GDP could be a fairly arbitrary assignment...

It seems kind of foolish for each allied NATO country to have separate mutually exclusive military spending programs.  The USA, France, etc. might be better at producing military equipment and aircraft, while Canada might be better at producing multilingual officers and personnel for training missions.  If the different allied nations were organized to focus on particular military niches it might benefit NATO as a whole.  

I realize NATO wasn't designed to be a shared western military, but that seems to increasingly be what it's becoming, so why not embrace that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not to be needlessly contrary, but beyond a certain point, what value does wealth generation serve? Aggregating capital is enormously important in an economy for sure. However, I think its fair to say that there are individuals and corporations operating today that have amassed more wealth than they can ever realistically use... Pools of capital that just sit there, not benefitting the economy or really the owner of the wealth.

I think this problem stems from employment without ownership. A lot of companies today give equity over time to their workers, but such practices should be wider spread.

Maybe this is needlessly philosophical, but when a bare majority of the eligible voting population casts a ballot, and a minority of that subpopulation gains a majority share of seats in a legislature, it can be strongly argued that there is no true mandate for that resulting government.

Discomfort with online voting might be reduced enough that it could work, especially if they beta-test a good system in a few by-elections ahead of a general election. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like the endless arguments on transit completely ignore the [reality of congestion](http://natpo.st/1l7elWu), and the fact that by and large a car is always going to be perceived as a preferred option until tolls are introduced. Notwithstanding that paying for new transit demands new revenue models.

Yesterday, I was sitting in a packed bus on Lakeshore moving at a snail's pace through a traffic jam of SUVs, trucks, and cars all carrying only a single passenger each.

We are deluding ourselves that any transit plan will work short of better incentivizing fewer cars in city limits and busy highways as well as carpooling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I think the resulting atmosphere would expand outwards.

It would, but air pressure in the atmosphere is a gradient from the surface out into orbit.  What we experience on the surface as air pressure, which varies with weather patterns, would change significantly if earth suddenly had a lot more air surrounding it.  It's sort of like if you were standing at the bottom of the ocean, the weight of all the water above you creates absolutely enormous pressures. We live at the bottom of a giant ocean of gas.

CO2 makes up less than half a percent of the total atmosphere, so the amount of nitrogen and oxygen you would need to bring CO2 levels back to normal would likely be significant (21 molecules of O2 and 79 molecules of nitrogen for every excess molecule of CO2).  Removing that much water from the water cycle to make enough O2 would also likely be a significant impact, you would have to harvest these gases from asteroids and moons in our solar system.

That being said, atmosphere 'building' is a fascinating field of study.  Mars has an atmosphere that is mostly CO2, and its gravity is less than earth, so to make an earth-like atmosphere there on the surface, I believe I read somewhere that its atmosphere would be 3x the size of earth's, either in terms of depth or total volume... </TEXT>

<TEXT>   If the atmosphere is 1M kerplecks of gas, and there is 400 kerplecks of CO2, then adding 1 kerpleck of CO2, needs 2499 kerplecks of O2 to keep the 400 ppm CO2 ratio.

The atmosphere is actually mostly nitrogen though, N2, and only about 21% oxygen.  

Even if the ratio of CO2 to the other gases were held constant, I think you could expect additional effects from adding so much additional gas, increasing our total atmospheric pressure.

<TEXT>  electrolysis works with salt and dirty water too.

Yeah, but for a large scale process using briney water or water with a lot of impurities means increased issues of fouling, scaling, corrosion, etc.  Also, chlorine gas from chloride ions comes to mind... You can get around it with reverse osmosis, but each step along the way makes your process increasingly non-economical.  Depending on the amount of energy production in distributed locations, you might be able to rely on rain water.

 I wonder if releasing O2 into atmosphere would by necessity reduce CO2 and other pollutant ppm rates?

It would just dilute CO2, and only negligibly so.  Realistically, to reduce atmospheric CO2 you need to scavenge it out of the atmosphere.  I recall reading somewhere that while sounding absurd, because coniferous forests in the northern hemisphere are so rapidly regenerative, one of the best options to reduce atmospheric CO2 would be a logging and tree-planting operation to literally strip CO2 out of the atmosphere, storing it as biomass. (Some people talk about scaling this better with some giant algae farm as well)

That's the one upside of plastics being non-biodegradable is at least that's petroleum-originating carbon that will remain out of the atmosphere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Big oil invests a lot in hydrogen production, as pure hydrogen is an important component in various upgrading and refining processes.  However, the process remains more economical to generate the hydrogen from natural gas (methane) rather than water.

I like to think this will change as solar drives down the cost of energy and the petroleum industry shifts more towards materials (plastics, polymers, etc.).

However, it's very possible that the value of fresh water could change dramatically in the future... </TEXT>

<TEXT>   No previous government has really had to deal with the internet...

This argument would carry more weight if other countries employed such restrictive communications policies on their government scientists, which is not at all the case, for instance [the American policy](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7387/full/483006a.html) on this issue is:

 In the United States, President Barack Obama's administration has directed federal science agencies to develop integrity policies with clear guidelines for scientists who are approached by journalists.

 In December, agencies including the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued guidelines that promote openness with the press. For instance, NOAA and NSF-funded scientists and staff are free to speak to journalists without first seeking the approval of a public-affairs officer. The NSF's policy states that researchers are free to express their personal views as long as they make clear that they are not speaking on behalf of the agency. And scientists also have right of review over agency publications and press releases that claim to represent their expert opinions.

<TEXT>  But this culture is wrong and needs our culture instead

Multiculturalism isn't the melting pot. New cultures aren't erased, they're absorbed, respected, and acknowledged. However, prejudices, discrimination, violence and superstitions of cultures shouldn't be indulged simply because they're part of a nation's heritage. And, just because a group of people have historically resided in some geographical area does not provide them any divine right to continue discrimination, prejudice, hate or violence towards themselves or other groups, nor to exist in isolation to continue such behavior.

*"No man is an island entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 
own were; any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind. 
And therefore never send to know for whom 
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." -John Donne*

<TEXT>  So empirialism

I think you mean *imperialism*.

I suppose that's exactly what I'm advocating. Only instead of Canadian colonies, it would be charters of a world constitution held by a world citizenry.

Old imperialism, and even 'new imperialsm' of the 20th century with foreign military bases all over the world were conducted prior to Little Brother and the capacity for people to record abuse of an oppressive powers and organize protest and resistance like the Arab Spring. The problem with these movements pulling down their oppressive governments, or getting rid of foreign military authorities is that it creates a power vacuum similar to what I discussed in my previous post when western powers try to pull out after 'Nation Building'.

However, if there was a world civilization charter and constitution with just laws, courts, and trade. Devised academically and crowdsourced to have wide input and shared interest rather than special interest. It would offer an alternative option for peoples of the world to demand and implement.

A franchised federation of fair government.

So yes, it's imperial, but it would largely be opt-in, self-implemented, and only executed by force in instances of extreme abuse of populations and corruption.

Any system will tend toward corruption, and traditional political models have only been accepted for their stability more than their effectiveness. However, the models for fair and equitable society and government are available to design and implement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All excellent examples of places where problems are acknowledged, but no outside action is taken because there's a feeling that either it's not worth it, or the consequences of action will just make the problem worse, like in Iraq right now. 

 Why Syria and Iran? Why is it a military problem?

Going to assume you meant Iraq, though there was plenty of sabre-rattling to invade Iran fairly recently too.

The problem as I see it is that the model of toppling a government through military invasion, followed by occupation, and then leaving a friendly government behind while pulling out doesn't work. It's failing now in both Afghanistan with the Taliban and Iraq with ISIS. You could make similar arguments for Hamas taking over in Gaza, though that was a democratic election.

Ultimately, these were/are expensive, drawn-out conflicts by western powers that are now blowing up in their faces.

I would propose that this is only going half way, and a permanent solution means a permanent occupation. However, this is impossibly expensive to achieve by a single country and also an injustice for one nation to take this action against another.

I would suggest it is not an injustice for the world to take such an action, however. I would like to see the formation of a world government, legal system, with police and courts, and an international military. Further, I would like see this international body gradually take over and remain a permanent fixture in small oppressive and/or corrupt states annexing them and introducing education, law, order, stable development of food, trade, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just think it would be interesting if every session of parliament you randomly dropped 34 people of unknown political alignment or background into the house to shake things up a little.  One could argue that our system of government is unfairly biased towards the selection of politicians to government.

Also, you have to admit, if you got a visit from a representative of the RCMP one day who informed you that you had been selected to sit in the house of commons for a term, you'd be pretty stoked, right? </TEXT>

Maybe instead of a genie it's a relic of a native tribe containing a trickster spirit and the system was never made to affect 30+ million people, but now the opportunity is here...

Second, we've gotta clean up these archives, there's dusty boxes and lamps on the floor, i'm tripping all over shit in here!

There was some talk of digitizing the genie and closing the archives, but there's not a lot of certainty about what's really happening there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Change the selection process of the governor general and lieutenant governor generals, such that they are selected from a body of representatives at the quasi-municipal level of government: mayors, rural reps, and first nations reps, etc. through a series of run-off ranked ballots.  Then allow them to exercise their veto power.

2. Create a special federal court beneath the Supreme Court of Canada of 5 justices to examine the constitutional legality of any new legislation. This court will examine challenges brought by the opposition (with controls in place so the opposition cannot simply challenge everything).  Similar courts of 3 justices at the provincial level.

3. Award 10% of the seats in both the commons and the senate, as well as provincial legislatures, on the basis of a lottery. ([Demarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarchy))

Adding extra backup wishes in case I can wish for more wishes, or take the lamp to my grandma and get her to wish:

4. This one is just me being goofy, but still: Introduce a special technocratic shadow branch of government bureaucracy with a black budget in charge of Canada's espionage and merge it with the the National Research Council to fund a series of 'mad' science projects domestically, with the mandate of improving and safe-guarding Canadian quality of life and increasing our global influence.

5. Make the public school system run year-round, however take some of the added time and put it towards applied-learning programs where students visit national parks, science labs, public-infrastructure locations, governments, etc. to get a better perspective on roles/functions in society.  

6. Begin transitioning public libraries towards becoming technology spots and [hackerspaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) to encourage invention and entrepreneurship.  It's crazy how much space opens up when you don't have to house tons of physical books. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Finding yourself in an obscure archives near parliament hill, you accidentally trip and collide with a stack of dusty boxes spilling what looks like a genie's magic lamp on the floor (or maybe a relic of a native tribe containing a trickster spirit; alignment chaotic neutral?). Picking up the lamp (relic) and going ahead and rubbing it for fun, out pops the genie (spirit) of Canadian political science.  The genie offers to fulfill any 3 wishes specifically pertaining to changing the governing political and legal mechanisms of Canada (all three branches).

What are three changes that you would propose?

<TEXT> Instead of starting a whole new political party, you might have more luck starting up a 'faction' or special interest within an existing party that's already somewhat compatible with your ideals.  

Also, it sounds like you have a lot of concern about fiscal transparency rather than 'futurism', so you might want to consider alternative branding.  Otherwise, you need something more novel than an expensive website that very few people are likely to want to look at to grab positive attention for 'futurism'.  

I always thought it would be interesting if a government programs could be run through a quasi-crowdsourcing model, where gov't programs/policy could be advertized like kickstarter campaigns, and adoption to an extent would be based on the popularity of their online support.  If you wanted to be really radical, you could let people direct a portion of their taxable incomes to the programs and goods that they want to support, so that people don't feel like their money is wasted, it goes exactly where they wanted it to (well, at least a portion, hard to get people excited about a new sewage treatment facility, however much a new one is needed...). </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Ruby Tuesday by the Rolling Stones](http://youtu.be/NW2eL8qWIvI) was incorporated into the [Royal Tenenbaums (2002)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/) pretty brilliantly by Wes Anderson.  In order to introduce the track, he first plays [She Smiles Sweetly](http://youtu.be/hlEatlyMv4Q), from the same album.  

Cameron Crowe picked it as his [#9 favourite music moments in film](http://www.empireonline.com/features/cameron-crowe-music-moments), saying: 

*"When "She Smiled Sweetly" flows into "Ruby Tuesday," even though Wes is re-sequencing the album, the result is an left-hook of deeper emotion. Now this already wonderful scene takes off into true greatness. Many a director has tried to use "Ruby Tuesday," the evocative Brian Jones/Stones classic, and failed. Wes solves the problem by letting you hear it the way the way you'd hear it in life... devastating and random in the way it pops up, innocently requiring you to remember the moment forever."* </TEXT>

But how telling are live debates really?  It's usually just a demonstration of how well leaders can weave talking points at each other.  You have very little guarantee (especially with American live debates) whether the points being made are even factual.

The only part of televised debates that I appreciate is when candidates with little chance of winning take the opportunity to criticize and question the candidates that likely will win. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something that's been discussed here sporadically, but I'd really welcome getting some fresh opinions: 

**What is the real advantage to having piloted aircraft as opposed to remotely piloted drones?**

I feel like if Canada were to shift their investment away from conventional aircraft towards developing innovative drone technology now, we would possess a strategic advantage in future engagements.

I'm definitely interested in current limitations, but I also see them as opportunities for next gen drone tech.

It seems as though a lot of the current limitations to conventional aircraft are the human body itself, and reaction times of pilots.  Plus, from a PR standpoint, without the potential loss of pilots, the US have been able to run pretty dangerous missions with drones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For all the therapeutic opportunities for gene therapy that open up from using CRISPR, the conventional markets are the EU and North America first, where patents, at least in pharma, are still somewhat observed.  

Give it a couple years and someone will develop an alternative CRISPR protein suite, but in that time a few companies will be several years ahead in clinical trials for their new therapies.

Still, the genie is out of the bottle.  This is going to make the next 20 years look very interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I see the majority of people using the internet to further insulate themselves to ideas that confirm their views rather than to actively seek new information that counters it. I see politicians playing up these divisions between the good and the bad. I see scientists being placed on sides rather than simply presenters of fact. I quite frankly see our system getting worse.

The idea of filter bubbles freaks me out a little for whether my own positions are based on objectively weighing several arguments, or if they just fit conveniently into the adhoc moral model I've built for myself to interpret the world.

.....I need a beer

Absolutely.

<TEXT> While this is an interesting result, it's important to consider that losing the function of glucosidase has a major impact on countless protein-receptor regulations for countless glycoproteins in the body.  (Around 50% of all proteins are glycosylated^1, though that includes O-glycans which aren't affected by this mutation)

It's almost like if we lived in a world where circles didn't exist, that

Every N-glycan on every protein of every cell coming out of the endoplasmic reticulum is going to fail to have the correct post-translational modifications it should have leaving the Golgi.

It's miraculous these kids are actually still alive, but they'll actually suffer the side effects:
 Early in life, they each had a complex disorder characterized by dysmorphic facial features, generalized hypotonia, seizures, global developmental delay, cerebral atrophy, a small corpus callosum, optic-nerve atrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, hypoplastic genitalia, chronic constipation, and recurrent bone fractures; severe hypogammaglobulinemia was also diagnosed.

<TEXT> Well, the ideas don't necessarily disappear.  Not unless it's all out genocide.  Especially today, where we have books, internet, etc., such that there are more vehicles for information and ideas than just the people who believe in them.  

For instance, fascism, communism, and liberal democracy with a mix of capitalism and socialism were all fairly popular in the mid 20th century.  However, by armed conflict (WWII) and a mix of armed/economic conflict (various cold war arenas, etc.) you could say that liberal democracy with a relatively free economy became the acceptable consensus for several countries.  Even China is gradually liberalizing their society and economy over time.  So a consensus on the societal model of government and economy is gradually being reached, even though in some cases armed conflicts have contributed to those developments.

An example of where an armed conflict lead to a weak consensus could be WWI, where the treaty at the end was completely one-sided, so an agreeable consensus was really impossible.  So a weak consensus, could be said to only be accepted as long as one side can force it on to another.

Edit:  A slightly more recent example would be countries that had dictators for several decades.  The populace was mostly willing to accept these arrangements, or at least uprisings could be put down fairly successfully, leading to a weak-consensus.  However, once one uprising succeeds, it can be very difficult to successfully achieve a new stable consensus that's acceptable for the majority of the population. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm willing to accept the conclusion that more information doesn't by itself assist in the reaching of consensus. After all, the more nuanced the information, the more difficult to form informed opinions.

However, I'd argue that none of this indicates stupidity. Conflict of ideas ensures the absolutely strongest consensus is finally reached, sometimes violently. Look at slavery, now followed by gay rights, drug policy, etc.

Conflicts of ideas within society eventually leading to stable consensus on acceptable norms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went looking for an article [blaiming rail-bitumen for why wheat isn't moving](http://theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/railcar-shortage-leaves-farmers-in-lurch/article15370310/), but apparently that's not the real culprit. Found this [blog post](http://albertadiary.ca/tag/canadian-wheat-board) giving some interesting info. Skim till about the 10th paragraph.

The real problem, as farmer Bill Gehl, chairperson of the Canadian Wheat Board Alliance, a group representing farmers who tried to save the board, said last November is that without the farmer-controlled single-desk Wheat Board, nobody is coordinating grain sales, transportation logistics, and the efficient use of port terminal facilities.

That, in turn means port terminals are now competing with each other to use rail transport capacity just to generate grain handling revenue.

The result is they do not always have the right grade and type of grain in place so ships either cannot get a full load at one terminal, as they could when our Wheat Board arranged deliveries, or ships have to wait for more of the correct grade and type of grain to arrive, Mr. Gehl said. The result is too many ships waiting much too long and that means farmers get less money.

Added together, Mr. Larsen says, this is truly a train wreck of immense proportions. If we assume last years western crop was worth about $7 billion, it means more than $2.8 billion has been taken out of the wests economy! Include the effect of the drop in the U.S. dollar, since most grain is sold in that currency, the actual decline has been more than 50 per cent.

Another thing Canadian farmers will soon be free of is the excellent reputation Canadian wheat and barley had with buyers abroad  Japanese and Chinese end users are already complaining the new privatized Canadian system isnt delivering the quality theyve expected for generations from the Wheat Board.

Edit: Basically, it just seems that the market hasn't shifted to account for logistical aspects of the grain trade yet... </TEXT>

<TEXT> My limited understanding is that a great deal of electrical energy is lost in the [transmission and distribution](http://www.nema.org/Products/Documents/TDEnergyEff.pdf) (pdf link) from the power plant, and also trying to match production against the system load. 

A good example would be countries trying to use renewables, like Denmark, where they sell off a lot of their excess power on the cheap, and then have to [purchase it back](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gathering-the-wind/) when the load increases.  [Ontario has a similar problem to this](http://www.thestar.com/business/2011/08/29/ontario_pays_others_to_take_its_surplus_power.html).

If we had the capacity to store the surplus power that we generate in the grid, not only would be have an easier time avoiding blackouts, but we could run our power-generating facilities a lot more efficiently, only generating power to top up the system and saving our surplus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The other thread is getting more responses to this, but personally I would invest in the loading and storage capacity of the Ontario power grid.  

As a for instance, in California Tesla is starting to sell their advanced batteries separate from their cars and people are putting them in their homes to minimize their power-draw from the grid during peak loads.

There are other larger simpler options that can be implemented at the neighbourhood-scale.

Currently, we waste ~~most~~ a lot of the electricity we generate. (Edit: hyperbole) </TEXT>

Tesla is starting to sell their advanced batteries separate from the cars and people are putting them in their homes to minimize their power-draw from the grid during peak loads.

<TEXT> I don't understand why they wouldn't spend $440M on smarter infrastructure instead, and bring down costs that way. The gov't goes to all the trouble of taking your money, only to give a meager bit back... Ridiculous.

Edit: We should be [modernizing our power grid infrastructure](http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-tech/sustainable/grid-energy-storage.htm) to allow for distributed storage and loading to reduce the costs for everyone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are currently annexing it, whether or not it's validated won't change the fact that it is so.  

One option: isolate Russia, 'send a message', economic sanctions, halt trade, depress European markets further, damage to the world economy and markets, if Russia isn't economically destabilized leading to uprisings relations normalize and Russia keeps Crimea.

2nd option: negotiate some kind of  realistic diplomatic resolution where Russia gets Crimea (which they already have, and they're keeping), and the new Ukrainian state isn't crippled economically.  At least with some kind of 'purchase' they get something out of this.  As things currently stand, they'll be digging themselves out of an economic hole for a decade or more without an armed conflict occurring.

Call it appeasement, there are certainly some parallels with ~~the Anschluss~~ the Sudetenland, but Crimea isn't Czechoslovakia. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So it's okay to violate national sovereignty so long as ethnicities match up?

The morality of the maneuver is moot.  They've sacked Crimea, without firing a shot, and they won't lose face and give it up, regardless of any economic sanctions.  The largely Russian inhabitants of Crimea also make 'taking it back' morally grey. 

 you can make it clear that any attempt to expand by military force will be made to fail, one way or the other, so as to discourage further attempts.

I am honestly curious what you would suggest for this.  Economic sanctions would probably work, seeing as the Russian economy is already faltering.  However, the damage to the world economy to cut off Russia isn't going to be insignificant.  There's also the possibility that destabilizing Russia economically could cause political uprising there, which might sound good on paper, but would mean instability over a very large region and several global markets.

Some kind of realistic diplomatic resolution must occur, we're all connected now.

<TEXT> You definitely can't out-macho Russia.  Jingoism or military escalation isn't the answer.  

Frankly, given that Crimea is ethnically more or less Russian, its being annexed isn't completely unjust.  

However, the stresses that are being leveled on the new Ukrainian state, and the amount of funds that have been [robbed out of the country](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/ukraine-search-missing-billions-yanukovych-russia) are the part what concern me the most.  Furthermore, the [Russian economy is tumbling](http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/03/03/russian-rate-hike-ukrainian-unrest-send-stocks-for-a-tumble/) and everyone is shorting the ruble, so they're not actually in great condition following this; to say nothing of the ["G7" pulling out of the next G8 meeting](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-crisis-g7-jointly-condemns-russia-halts-g8-prep-1.2557174) which was supposed to be in Sochi.

<TEXT> I came across some interesting data after our conversation at the convention about this.  Interestingly enough, the manufacturing capacity and production from the US (and probably Canada too) has continued to rise unabated regardless of economic downturns over the past few decades.  Manufacturing jobs, however, have stagnated and are going down.  

Automation...

Canada needs to be more concerned about making new innovative products and less about faltering brands and unskilled labour. </TEXT>

My other favorite part was meeting Marc Garneau when I got up up during a policy session to defend the role of the National Science Advisor, and the resolution that the position should be reinstated.

Beyond that just meeting and hanging out with so many people from this sub was really awesome.

Another amusing thing that happened is I have slightly longer hair right now so I kept getting mistaken for Justin Trudeau as long as my back was turned. One woman kept demanding to know if I was his secret half-brother throughout the convention. </TEXT>

Saying that the ends don't justify the means would be a better argument. 

Honestly, I'd like to see an outcome more like what's occurring in Myanmar right now for many of these states.  You're right that simply propping up these governments isn't the answer.  However, /u/truejaywasright is right (hah) in pointing out that any solutions in this region needs to be brokered along with China, Russia, and any other power that will add to that final stability.

Unfortunately, that will probably have to wait until oil is no longer worth recovering. Or, like in the case of N. Korea, there's no longer a need for a buffer state between China and Japan.

The status quo is better than any other achievable outcome under current circumstances. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my perspective I see this as an excellent way to spur innovation and entrepreneurship. When you're worried about financial security you don't take risks. Give Canadians a real financial safety net instead of a welfare trap and they will start more small businesses and startups, which will provide more jobs.

Widespread automation is going to disappear conventional labour. Canada needs new economic sectors or it will cease to be globally competitive.

**Edit:** I want to [draw attention to this short video](http://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc) [10:48] that details a counter-intuitive disconnect between a person's personal motivation and financial rewards, which is really good to think about when considering the merits of any minimum income strategy.

<TEXT> One major area of health policy that needs to be revisited is the manufacturing of the influenza vaccines.  

The current process involving chicken eggs really isn't flexible enough, in terms of production, compared to available alternatives.  If a pandemic starts, or if the flu-variant that gains supremacy doesn't match with expectation put forward by [the WHO](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/13vol39/acs-dcc-4/index-eng.php#siv), or if in the case of this article, the demand for vaccination is just higher than expected, it's not possible for industry to increase supply to meet that sudden demand.

[Several alternatives are emerging](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/19/us-flu-vaccines-idUSBRE90I0AI20130119) in the US, capable of far more rapid deployment, that should be more closely examined at the policy-level here in Canada. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ~~I think you mean 'unfavourably'?~~

No, but the Bank of Canada is an independent body, and as per the article, it's very unconventional for the finance minister to make any statements regarding interest rates, which are the sole purview of the Governor of the BoC.

 More to the point, how is this any of his business? The minister of Finance doesnt set interest rates in this country: the Bank of Canada does.

i.e. these answers Flaherty has given are not just out of character for him, but out of character for any finance minister ever.

Mr. Flaherty doing so to screen for Poloz would seem to tip their hand that the Tories are seeing themselves as feeling vulnerable about their federal appointments lately.  Possibly due to senate scandals of the past year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The raising of interest rates is typically viewed as a fairly unpopular move by businesses.  I feel as though Flaherty is actually carrying water for Stephen Poloz in this case - taking the negative focus on to himself to test the waters on raising rates, so when they are increased in 2014 the new governor won't receive as much flack from business for the move. 

The [selection of Stephen Poloz to succeed Marc Carney](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stephen-poloz-named-next-bank-of-canada-governor-1.1302494) this past year as the Governor of the BoC seems to fit with a similar pattern to the appointment of Justice Nadon to the Supreme Court in that both were [unexpected selections](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/what-justice-nadons-appointment-says-about-the-supreme-courts-future/article16192045/?page=all) by the Tories.  

I think it's fair that the gov't doesn't want those appointments to be viewed unpopularly, which means taking measures to keep them from looking bad in the media.  In this case, Flaherty could be getting out in front of the rate-hike, blaming it on 'international pressure' from the OECD and IMF, taking the focus off Poloz. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In scientific research, a conclusion follows directly from a hypothesis (made by a researcher), which provokes the initial experiment in the first place.  Therefore to divorce the conclusions from the researcher is impossible in the scientific method.

It's the communication of those conclusions which is inherently political.  So the question is, should the communication of research conducted by government scientists be restricted by the state.  

Various countries have different policies in this regard; however Canada under the tories have erred on the side of being [more restrictive](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/04/01/information-commissioner-to-investigate-harper-governments-muzzling-of-federal-scientists/).  This hasn't been just with regard to science, but with regard to communication in general.  

It's not a war on science, it's just controlling the message.

That said, the Canadian public finances this research and unless it's something dangerous for public consumption, access to that research should be available.  Further, just because one is employed by the government shouldn't restrict their ability to communicate as a free citizen provided they announce that they are speaking from their expertise and not from their office. </TEXT>

Not that I think this narrative is inaccurate, since I think every nation and several private organizations are indeed always seeking to gather intelligence, and I think most Canadians expect this of our government. However, I wonder if it would be more valuable to turn this known spy or give them false information rather than out him for more favorable media coverage.

If this is to deflate the recent G20 story from the CBC and Snowden, then it's basically spending national security capital for partisan benefit. </TEXT>

By this do you mean the debates?

I would say Dion had a lot in common with Richard Nixon in the sense that he's a very intelligent policy maker and is apparently very good in one-on-one interactions, but on television he lacked charisma and just didn't look and sound right.

Regarding the comparison to Nixon, I'm referring to when Nixon and JFK had the [first televised presidential debate in US history](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2021078,00.html).  Those listening on the radio thought Nixon won, while those watching on TV were taken in by JFK's looks and charm, catapulting him in the polls. </TEXT>

I don't think it's fair for you to suggest that the mods have set up the rules to be broad or overreaching, thus making them easier to enforce.  First, the rules are very specific and minimal in order to maintain this as an open forum where actual content and perspectives can be posted and discussed as objectively as possible without being suffocated by lazy downvotes.

<TEXT> Strong R D tax incentives are already in place, the government is practically throwing money at companies to do research through universities (not that it's effective at all).  

The pulling new markets out of the ground aspect interests me more, I admit.  I wonder how many federal dollars go towards things like accelerator centres and young entrepreneurship (not that money is necessarily the answer).  It's definitely hard at the federal level to make small impacts without making a mess of things, though I think a lot of small impacts is the answer here.

Everyone I know who has started a company has inevitably moved south because the environment was just better for start-ups.  Investment, mentorship, etc.

Your earlier comment about draft-picks for sports teams reminded me of an idea I had a little while ago about how it might be interesting to develop a conference/festival sort of like SXSW around the idea of setting up a competitive draft-style system for helping companies/investors to make relationships with new inventors/creators.  

Set up a government-sponsored bursary program to fly inventors/creators out to the location with matching dollars from industry partners as part of the sponsorship-packages.  Offer start-up workspace in Canada at accelerator centres to help keep business foundations in Canada.

The conference would be a competition with lots of online voting and free PR for inventors that want to get their products noticed that could match funding from small individual donors like kickstarter with a matching investment from whichever industry-partner that wins the pick for that group in the draft, and another matching investment from the gov't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If anything I'd like to see corporate income taxes reduced and look into alternative revenue models.

I'd like to see more creative policy development to help encourage corporate investment and new business to drive the economy and bring jobs back.  Raising corporate income taxes will simply further diminish the appeal of Canada as a place to do business.

Back when Canada had a low dollar we were seen as a good place to invest because it was cheaper to do manufacturing up here.  That wouldn't work today because it will inevitably be cheaper at this point to start new manufacturing overseas.  However, the lesson remains if it's cheaper doing business here, especially with the proximity to the US market, it's advantageous for businesses to move here.

Edit for clarity:  I also do not recommend Canada return to having a low dollar.  Rather that the analogy shows the benefits of establishing a circumstance where it's more competitive for businesses to invest and establish themselves here. </TEXT>

That can't be a healthy direction for a society to take though.

You can only sweep so much under the rug, and xenophobia isn't helped, only appeased.

<TEXT> Well, hopefully we get around to releasing him then.  I can't help thinking if the circumstances were different - if I had grown up in the same environment as him, that I'd most likely be right in his shoes, or dead.  

I would rather see a person punished for their choices rather than their circumstances.

He's turning 27 this year... 12 years in jail. Not even real jail for most of it, some extra-legal fake jail created to avoid humane conditions. Thinking about him reminds me of a character named Leggatt in this Joseph Conrad story I read years ago called [The Secret Sharer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Sharer), where one guy helps shelter a murderer because he can't help see himself in the other's place if the circumstances had been reversed.

As Canadians we can't fix the whole Guantanamo Bay fiasco, but we can do what we used to do in situations like this: be an example.  Show the rest of the world that we don't have to lock someone up for the rest of their lives just because politically and legally we don't know what else to do with them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Do we require them to get a doctor to sign off on it?

Yes, a doctor should make the final call.

In this case you've given anecdote for instance, mandatory vaccines are not produced in chicken eggs, just influenza comes to mind actually. They're also moving away from that practice of using eggs to using insect cells because with the H1N1 outbreak, the dose/egg was so low they couldn't produce enough vaccine to meet demand.

(I'll add some links to this later when I'm off my phone, but it's the same idea as how Glaxo makes the HPV vaccine).

Most mandatory vaccines (Measles, mumps, rubella) and polio before that were/are made in cultured embryonic human cells (WI38). (I believe this is still the case) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of the problem is establishing a market place for venture capital. You go down to California, and it's reached the point where those with the money and inclination are going there to seek out innovators. 

How do you convince all those people to congregate in Canada?

I think the answer, at least to get the ball rolling is to sponsor technology and culture festivals/conferences. Sort of like how SXSW has that partial tech-focus that attracted venture capitalists to Texas.

It's not just money though, proper mentorship apparently is really difficult to come by and a lot of other factors. I read an article by Eric Migicovsky, the CEO of Pebble that noted a lot of points about how more money isn't the solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I keep bringing up an idea at parties that I think is funny; basically, to have a kid as a time-share.

Because the cost and time-investment in having children today seems to be the most difficult part of the scenario (apart from real estate), I figured technically you could just have three separate couples mutually adopt a kid together.  Sort of like having the divorce ahead of time.  You get to raise a kid, have a stake in the future, teach them what you know, feel like a parent.  But, it would be like 2 days a week and one holiday in the year.  

I think it could work out, despite how outrageous it sounds. I liken it back to when we all lived in small villages and children would sort of be raised by everyone.  Living in little silo nuclear families seems unhealthy, I remember growing up in the burbs and having no idea who my neighbours were.  We're all losing that sense of 'community' that's important from a psychological perspective.

<TEXT> Try engineering sometime...  Lots of theory, no real choice in courses because it's an accredited program. 

You forget the material after the classes mostly, but they teach the courses in a different way from other programs.  Everything is problem-solving over and over again.  So, when you encounter an open-ended problem in the real world, before you know it you're spinning out potential solutions to it.  It's rare that you remember a lot of the specifics of the courses though.

What I'm suggesting though is that learning at the university level needs to be more of an active process.  Not just sitting in lectures absorbing information.  Students should be taught and encouraged to develop commercial and intellectual products, whether that's art and poetry or robots and rockets.  And, to figure out outlets for that creativity to generate economic stability for themselves.

Most of my friends studied art and music out of high school.  They actually do fairly well selling their wares on Etsy for instance.  

It's a new economy, we need to find new work models rather than relying on corporations to just "make jobs" for people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted this in the /r/Canada thread in response to someone suggesting another person should simply 'move where the work is':

 I don't think people should have to move somewhere for economic opportunity. Continuing to rely on established companies to supply jobs can't be the answer.

 It's a global economy now, opportunity is everywhere. We're just not doing enough as individuals to generate economic opportunities for ourselves. The generation we're following all got jobs that they stayed in for years with the hope of eventually retiring. It's hard to break away from that pattern having grown up observing it as 'the thing to do'.

 Unskilled labour in the new economy is rapidly disappearing. Where it's not disappearing, it's being outsourced to developing countries.

 We're creative people though, there needs to be a revolution in small-scale entrepreneurship. New forms of intellectual and commercial products... Fewer salaried 9to5 jobs, more ownership. Otherwise, we're just going to be another lost generation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think institutions of higher learning need to put more emphasis on entrepreneurship. Degrees where you take a class, write a test, and forget the material after need to be changed. All the way back to K-12.

Students should be spending a large part of their university time building their own organizations. Doesn't have to be commercial products, I think the same model could apply to the arts. However, more applied creativity. More 'doing stuff', less scan-tron multiple choice.

Also, increased subsidies. Education should be the most affordable investment a person can make. Economically, 'return on education' is one of the most proven benefits. </TEXT>

http://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/1i0siv/domestic_dream_of_25_children_per_woman_long_gone/

The cost of living for youth today, the absence of opportunities...  This I feel is the real driving force to low birthrate.  Children require a lot of financing, and with the economy the way it is for young people, it's no surprise people don't want to start families.

Add mounting student debt, the cost of owning a home...  I feel like we're cutting our country off at the knees. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This feels like a natural political issue, since Canada will need to continue having an aggressive immigration policy in order to supplement our aging population.  Aggregate Canadian culture, values, and politics will see a major shift in response to changing voter demographics (which I suppose is the point of [Ibbitson and Bricker's Big Shift book](http://www.cbc.ca/books/2013/03/how-the-political-landscape-is-changing.html))

I have to admit, as my cohort is now entering the encouraged time to start proliferating, I'm really turned off thinking about the cost of having a family.  I like kids, family, etc., not bothered by the idea of being a father, but economically it feels a little untenable...

It might be interesting to do a [meta] poll on this sub regarding how users feel about the traditional life-model of settling down and having a kids.  I don't feel like I'm alone in my generation looking at it this way.  Young people today are probably too concerned with finding a job and keeping it, than taking on the added economic and financial risk of having kids...

<TEXT> There is refining capacity in Eastern Canada, however the refineries are not set up to accept the Alberta product.  Apparently, the reason the Keystone is such a big deal, is because the refineries in the Gulf Coast were already upgraded to handle Venezuelan oilsands product...

I think a larger problem with the whole scenario is that the US is rapidly becoming an oil producer again with fracking of shale oil deposits.  This oil is of conventional quality, which means that Alberta product will soon become considerably less valuable in the face of a large supply of American conventional crude.

I really worry about the Canadian economy and Alberta when that happens... </TEXT>

 Over the 2003-2012 period, 52 of the 93 accidents (table 5   table 6) resulted in a release of product. Nineteen of these involved a release of natural gas, all with less than 1 cubic metreFootnote 7 of gas released. Fourteen accidents involved a release of crude oil, with 8 less than 1 cubic metre, 2 between 1 and 25 cubic metres, 3 between 26 and 1000 cubic metres, and 1 over 1,000 cubic metre

I couldn't find anything comparing it to releases by rail accidents though...

<TEXT> Admittedly, the damage and location make this particular case newsworthy, but there seem to be A LOT of derailment stories in the news this year... i.e. [Northern Ontario in April](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/cp-oil-spill-in-northern-ontario-larger-than-first-reported/article10781522/), [Saskatchewan in May](http://saskatoon.ctvnews.ca/more-than-91-000-litres-of-oil-spilled-from-derailed-sask-train-1.1290062)

I rarely see much of an explanation as to why the derailments occur though.

 pipelines have proportionately less spills than other modes of transport

Fewer spills, but the magnitude of the release ~~is typically~~ may be larger. Edit, I stand corrected.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That's saying that the roof is leaking, so we need a bigger bucket to hold the drips.

I'm acknowledging it's good to have a roof at all here, imperfect as it is.  You're saying it's only fair to tear it down and let everyone get wet.  Sure a good roof is the ultimate solution, but you're not going to get that if no one will stay in the house long enough to fix it. (this analogy is probably too drawn out, lol).

 It's a current grey area, which is why large, risk-averse companies can try this. The kinds of professional unpaid internships under discussion are not part of the underground, unregulated economy -- they work (like in this thread) in jobs like IT that are otherwise perfectly respectable.

If interns are unpaid, and not part of a "provincially recognized educational institution", then they are effectively part of an unregulated economy and unprotected labour-pool.

 we need to act sooner rather than later to reduce the supply of training for people who will ultimately never get a job in their field

Some internships don't lead to employment, it's true, but they all provide work experience that helps people find new employment and integrate better into their next position.  The training does have value.

<TEXT>  The root problem is one of motivation. Are unpaid internships so desirable that we as a society need to subsidize them, as you would with your EI plan?

I would argue yes.  If between 100,000 and 300,000 Canadians are voluntarily working without compensation in the hopes of getting a full time position, despite knowing it's illegal for a company to let them work without compensation there's a problem. 

 an outright prohibition is far, far simpler than trying to divide virtuous from sinister internships

Technically this prohibition already exists, and clearly it's ineffective since young people continue to work without compensation as unpaid interns, going uncounted.  

Policy-wise, your comment seems to say "do nothing, we've already got this right".  Or institute a crack-down on companies for unpaid internships, which will destroy potential employment opportunities for thousands of Canadians that have no work experience trying to enter the work force. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think trying to regulate internships and force employers to provide minimum wages is too heavy-handed an approach that will disincentivize companies from hiring interns in the first place.  These are positions for training skilled employees, as opposed to unskilled labour and services (i.e. minimum wage).

I've mentioned it [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/1hisec/unpaid_internships_exploit_vulnerable_generation/cauw0xg) that with the money that would be spent building a bureaucracy to regulate companies on internships and force them to pay a minimum wage, you could probably just give that money to interns in the first place and have them self-regulate the industry.

If they're on EI, they're accounted for (unlike now).  This will improve our unemployment statistics, to say nothing of the fact that you'll be putting money back in the pockets of consumers to help drive the economy.

If internships are free, more companies will hire interns for the prescribed time.  This will generate more employment opportunities.  Companies could be scored on a permanent-hire/internship metric for eligibility for a tax-credit to better incentivize good behaviour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One could argue that corporations *already* exploit young workers with internships.  At least with EI the more vulnerable new workers would receive some compensation. Furthermore, it would allow for the monitoring and regulation of internships which is currently not possible. (i.e. burger-flipping internships would not meet eligibility). 

This arrangement *is* a subsidy to corporations, that's the point. Where new workers will take greater risks on training and new employment in a changing economy, corporations will take more risks on how many new-hires come in the door, helping drive employment. The number of interns and the length of internships could be easily regulated to make this economical. Further, corporations could be scored based on a permanent-hires/interns metric for eligibility of a tax credit to further incentivize good behaviour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Simply introducing more regulation on to internships will just burden everyone, disincentivize the programs to companies and cost money you could otherwise just give to interns.

I would agree that the purpose of EI is meant to be an insurance fund; however, the whole point of EI is to get people unemployed working again.  Technically, they could NOT take an unpaid internship, continue job-hunting, and on that basis collect EI (which some people may very well be doing).  I think using state funds to subsidize internships could have significant economic benefits.

On one hand, more people will be willing to take chances on new training and internships in a changing economy.  Companies will be more inclined to hire interns.  Income will be transferred to those not otherwise earning any money, all of which will help drive the economy.

I think in terms of incentives, benefits, and the fact that the government infrastructure is already in place it could make for a nimble turn of policy to improve employment figures.

<TEXT> I agree it would be a harder sell to have it come out of regular EI, but I think a narrative of investing in a future work force by sponsoring future employment could actually put a more positive spin on EI from some of the perception that it gets today. (On a side note, do companies pay a separate fee into EI? I wouldn't be in favour of increasing corporate tax burdens in Canada.)

After all, interns are generally a youth demographic trying to get experience.  I would actually feel more generous about paying into EI knowing it was going to support them.

The other benefit is that if you're using established infrastructure, then the cost of added of bureaucracy is significantly reduced. i.e. no increase in the size of gov't argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One option that might work for all stakeholders on this issue is to compensate interns with employment insurance benefits.  That way they receive a basic income, and it's easier to track which companies are hosting interns properly and which may be abusing the system.

I feel like one of the problems with unpaid internships is that to a certain extent they're "off the books", so they're an easy means to violate labour-laws unless there's a complaint: 

 Student organizations and lobbyists estimate between 100,000 and 300,000 Canadians work without bringing home a paycheque. Statistics Canada does not track unpaid internships.

However, getting hired just on a resume can be enormously difficult and having a way to get your foot in the door with an organization can be of pretty significant benefit. So as long as it's in good faith, I feel like internships can be pretty beneficial.

Obviously there would be a tax-burden associated with this, but I think this kind of wealth-redistribution would be very healthy for the country and economy at large. </TEXT>

If however, this deal is being made to undercut the future of the archivist unions, that's obviously not appropriate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed, I look forward to a reopening of the debate.  

I believe in the sentiment of universal healthcare, but realistically the current delivery of healthcare in Canada is a badly designed system that it needs to be changed.

We gather every sick person into the same building, regardless of acuity, where wait times are extreme and a significant proportion will become sick on top of whatever they came in with, with drug-resistant hospital-associated infections (HAIs), which already kill more people in the united states than HIV, breast cancer and car accidents [combined](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/judith-johnson/hospital-acquired-infections_b_834425.html).

We have population statistics, we know how many of which kinds of procedures need to be conducted annually and where.  We should be completely overhauling the system such that specific offices/clinics treat specific sets of conditions, and meet the level of care that everyone deserves.

Hospitals and Doctors are not unlike centralized government in trying to be everything to everyone.  I don't mean we should throw the baby out with the bath-water, but there's got to be a better way to organize all this. </TEXT>

Furthermore, I believe a lot of the healthcare responsibility has been [discharged to the provinces](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/health-care-funding-how-harper-views-the-canadian-federation/article4182242/) in Harper's tenure.

Don't get me wrong, I think healthcare reform is important, and I can imagine models where private providers can exist.  However, I just don't think it's realistic to see this topic come up anytime soon. 

There was an interesting article the other day about how the Canadian electorate has been affected by [watching shows like Grey's Anatomy](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/06/05/greys-anatomy-makes-canadians-grateful-for-public-healthcare-study/) in terms of their perception of public healthcare.

<TEXT> I think you're assuming one party would continue to control both houses for a hypothetical elected senate. 

Likely there would be a second cabinet in the senate if the opposition in the commons held the upper-house. Furthermore, even if both houses of parliament were held by one party, legislation can be introduced in either house. Meaning, policy could simultaneously be dictated by either the PM or the senate leader and their respective cabinets. 

An elected senate would mean the PM giving half of the legislative power of that office away to the senate leader, and with it the de facto executive power.

So, foreign relations, trade, foreign policy... Who negotiates on Canada's behalf? What if there's another terrorism crisis like the FLQ...?

I can't help but feel reforming to an elected senate would inject a lot of instability into our parliamentary model of gov't in the absence of a supreme executive, such as a president.  

Again, I'm not a political scientist though, so if someone can assuage my concerns, I'd appreciate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Why would that diminish the power of the executive...?

The power of the executive would not be reduced, rather the position of Prime Minister.  Executive power would be split between the PM and the leader in the senate.  These individuals may not even belong to the same party.  In terms of foreign affairs and foreign relations, who would represent Canada?

I'm not an expert on the constitution or parliament, however. If executive powers are explicitly the province of the prime minister, I'd be very interested if someone could point out my misunderstanding (if I'm making one). </TEXT>

<TEXT> One serious problem/consequence with senate reform would be that in the absence of a separate executive branch of government (i.e. we have a symbolic governor general), reforming the red chamber would significantly diminish (if not usurp) the authority of the Prime Minister as the de facto head of state for Canada.  Therefore, it may harm the bargaining power of the Canadian government in international trade relations if the commons cannot as easily enact negotiated terms. </TEXT>

In some ways, I like this idea, because it lets individuals choose where they would like to direct their funds.  I think it would be interesting if there was a system, almost like Kickstarter, where Canadian citizens could elect to fund certain programs over others.  Like a policy market-place.  There could still be general revenue to fund regular activities, but there would be an additional system to fund things like science, research, the arts, infrastructure, bike-lanes, etc.  Provide some ownership, such that citizens feel like they're paying for the services they want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are tried and true methods of taking up revenue, for sure.  However, as economies become more globalized I worry more about these revenue generating methods, because Canada is forced to compete with other countries to attract investment.  

Raise corporate income taxes, and companies just move elsewhere.  Raise personal income taxes, people just hide their funds in offshore tax-havens.

Plus, these forms of taxation are politically unpopular, like you've mentioned, which can lead to irresponsible government policy and populism leading to deficit increases attempting to make the electorate happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With growing demand for overhaul of transportation infrastructure in various municipalities and ongoing concerns of deficit-reduction, I'm curious to a hear opinions from our community on taxes and revenues.

Some topical examples that have come under fire:

* Changes in the federal budget regarding [tariffs](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/canadian-consumers-will-feel-the-pain-of-ottawas-tariff-hikes/article10753547/)
* [Fees](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2013/05/27/toronto-ontario-metrolinx-revenue-tools-gtha.html) proposed by Metrolinx for the GTA, which include tolls and PST increases
* [Carbon taxes and Cap and Trade](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/09/18/reality-check-all-carbon_n_1894400.html), which might see more play during the next election

As citizens and consumers we all pay taxes.  I believe everyone understands that for governments to function and provide services, they require revenues; the size of government and the scope of those services notwithstanding.  So, I thought it would be fun to try some out-of-the-box thinking on how they could go about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would be pretty funny to see someone try it tomorrow and crash and burn horribly, but really, think about all the kids born post-Facebook.  Of that cohort, the ones that end up in politics are going to grow up in a hyper-documenting culture of people photographing, video-recording, and micro-blogging just about every innocuous event of their lives, *voluntarily*.  72 hours of video already gets uploaded to YouTube [*every minute*](http://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html).  

The average person's privacy is trending downwards rapidly as we head somewhat organically into a complete surveillance culture.  Extrapolate 20 years and think about how politicians are going to be behaving...

It's that whole 'Little Brother' thing (rather than extreme surveillance by the state, i.e. 'Big Brother', there is extreme surveillance in aggregate by everyone's individual recording devices and our hyper-documenting behaviour).  Someday, to be a public person will be true in every sense of the word, IMHO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree it would be overkill if it was an enforced scenario, but with the amount of self-documentation people already perform just as part of growing social media, I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility to start seeing politicians record and distribute all their official activities voluntarily. 

Especially with the convenience of wearable computing devices coming out like google-glass, I feel like politicians might be driven to such self-documentation as a means to control how they are perceived by the electorate and the media.  

That's one of the strengths of politicians like Naheed Nenshi.  Since he actively and consistently communicates by twitter, facebook, etc., directly to the Calgary electorate, in many ways he influences his own public perception more than if he just relied on conventional media reviewing his tenure as mayor.

Also, wow, I'm getting a ton of downvotes lately, I wonder who I pissed off... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure how many positions Harper personally added.  The wikipedia article lists the precedence of each position, but the [last 10 or so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Canada#Current_Cabinet) have no date associated with them.  However, looks like it's on par with what Paul Martin had:

 ...the size and structure of the Canadian Cabinet is relatively malleable, the slate of Cabinet positions tending to be substantially restructured periodically, the last major period of realignment occurring between 1993 and 1996. Throughout the 20th century, Cabinets had been expanding in size until the Cabinet chaired by Brian Mulroney, with a population of 40 ministers. Mulroney's successor, Kim Campbell, reduced this number, and Jean Chrtien eliminated approximately 10 members of the ministry from the Cabinet, so that by 1994 there were a total of 23 persons in Cabinet. Under the chairmanship of Paul Martin, the number increased again to 39, in the vicinity of which it has remained; the Cabinet proper currently comprises 31 ministers, with another 7 members of the ministry who are not of the cabinet.

[Coyne](http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/01/07/how-to-make-a-cabinet/) made some good points on the subject a while back: 

 As far as I have been able to tell, Canada has the largest cabinet of any government in the democratic world: possibly even the undemocratic world. It is 50 per cent larger than Britains, 73 per cent larger than Italys, and more than twice as large as that of the United States of America. It is also more than twice as large as the cabinet Mackenzie King employed to cope with the Great Depression and fight a world war...(Macleans, Jan 2011) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came across this conservative action group after hearing about it on the This American Life podcast (also listed on the front page for the link).  

They make some really interesting points beyond those you've listed for why conservatives have thus far rejected climate-related issues.  The major one seemed to be that acknowledging climate-change was seen in some ways as a betrayal of "the American dream", because it suggested people should have to give up the privileges inherent to developed western nations.  That they should 'feel bad' for wanting to hold on to the way of life we enjoy.

I can see something similar in Canada when people suggest that the answer to climate change is to completely forego exploiting natural petroleum reserves such as the oil sands, which has been a major national income and overall economic boon.

Personally, I think if Canada pioneered a position where personal and corporate income taxes were nullified in place of taxes on environmental impact, I think it could:

* a) Spur some really interesting engineering innovation to lower emissions
* b) Attract a lot of new business, since corporate income taxes would be much lower than other countries

The only problem would be that as such innovations occurred, national revenue would gradually decrease, and there would be a structural deficit driven by green-innovations...

Also, finding ways to balance the new tax code such that existing operations weren't suddenly swamped in new environmental taxes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're right to worry about losing the broader picture; however, I think you need to consider that it's the regulators that see this every day have the expertise, more so than the federal bodies. 

I worry more about situations like Fracking, where most of the analysis and field-testing has been done in Alberta, but shale-deposits in other parts of the country might not benefit from the regulatory know-how that's developed in Alberta.  Another good example is acid-gas injection for sequestering CO2 and H2S under ground.  Nearly all of these wells are in Alberta, but if carbon-capture became a federally mandated scenario, you would see it in other parts of the country quite rapidly.

Rather than having approvals go through the province and the federal government, it makes more sense to share information and research between provincial regulators and have the feds set the bar for what the provinces should be looking for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't believe *in situ* EOR is across too many provinces. However, I do totally agree that holding the same meter-stick to these projects across provinces is essential. However, I think that can be achieved by a federal body mandating that onto provincial bodies, rather than doing double or triple submissions to multiple regulators.

Furthermore, some provincial bodies have greater expertise in particular areas, such as Alberta Environment and the ERCB for *in situ* EOR. Ideally, they would help draft guidelines that Environment Canada could approve and apply to other provincial bodies.

So I guess what I mean, is that I'd prefer more information sharing and stream-lining of regulation, rather than siloed bureaucracies acting independently.

The latter option may seem more robust (i.e. more eyes per project), but I think in today's day and age, we have to adopt more effective systems.

<TEXT> Something important to consider here is that this development is removing federal environmental regulation.  Provincial regulation of these projects will remain intact.

I think this is a smart move.  Rather than Environment Canada directly regulating these projects, they should be mandating the level of scrutiny that the provincial bodies bring to bear.  Alberta Environment, and the Environmental Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) have a lot of expertise and personnel to oversee in-situ enhanced oil recovery projects, so it makes sense not to double-dip.

In general, depending on the sizes of the projects, I think it's a good model for the federal regulatory bodies, to be auditing and working through the provincial bodies. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Avoiding the tough question

Unless I'm misunderstanding, I believe the question is whether investing in genomic sequencing technology for healthcare in Canada for the general population will be worth the cost.

Logically, apart from pathogenic illnesses (viruses, infections, etc.) and physical accidents, all other illnesses and disorders that remove people from the workforce must be the result of hereditary predisposition or gene mutation.  

Numerous examples are already available for predicting such disorders with genomic data, such as the one in the linked article for mutated BRCA-1 (breast and ovarian cancer).

It makes sense that the total cost of developing such tests for the general population (which are currently on the order of a few thousand dollars and are continuing to fall, as per the link in my previous comment), will be a lower economic burden than letting them get sick and fill hospitals (which is the current strategy).  Hospital associated infections (HAIs) already kill more people in north america than [car-accidents AIDS or breast cancer](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=beating-back-the-bugs).  i.e. you go to the hospital for one thing, get sick with a drug-resistant infection, and stay significantly longer or never come out at all.  Any measures that reduce the number of people making extended stays in hospitals is probably going reduce the healthcare economic burden.

Implementing genomic testing should be examined in a larger economic analysis, I agree, but for the sake of argument let's assume I'm wrong.  Even if such a program operated at a economic loss, it would be still be morally worthwhile to provide such care rather than letting Canadians simply get sick.  Really, this is the underlying argument for having universal healthcare in Canada in the first place.

 They'll just be dying of a *different* disease at high cost

Actually, predisposition to these disorders would also be detectable.  However, they would be more linked to elderly individuals, rather than tax-paying younger people getting cancer or heart disease in middle age.  /u/Darth_Face2021 makes some excellent points in this regard as well.

<TEXT>  The cost has fallen

I actually said the cost is *falling*, research and development by groups all over the world continue to push down the cost of this technology and this [trend](http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) is expected to continue.  

 which thing in healthcare should we stop funding

I think we can reasonably agree that the cost of patient care for degenerative disorders (so illnesses that progressively get worse over time) is higher when treated at later stages than if it is if detected earlier.  This measured in terms of time spent in healthcare facilities, treatments, and attention from personnel, but also lost productivity when patients are out of the workforce with illness for extended periods of time.

Implementing large-scale genomic diagnostic medicine for preventative care could be economically viable in the sense that early detection of illness (also providing information to patients of what they are 'predisposed to') could allow early treatment for disorders.  Therefore, less would be spent in aggregate to keep people healthier overall.

So, which thing in healthcare would I stop funding? The majority of the really sick people, because they would no longer exist.

The topical example in the article if of Angelina Jolie spending a few thousand dollars to learn she's predisposed to breast cancer and ovarian cancer (mutated BRCA-1 gene), so she's having elective surgery to prevent those eventualities.  Overall, these procedures cost less than if she actually had cancer and then had to be treated for it, with chemo, radiation, antibodies, etc., on top of these surgeries.

 The other half of the question

This is the direction of medicine in the 21st century.  Better data, more timely treatments.  Canada can get ahead of other countries in developing and implementing these procedures and treatments.  At the same time build databases of genomic information that can be licensed to other countries that want to implement similar programs.  So there's further economic arguments to generating the intellectual property first.

I'm not suggesting that all these practices should be implemented as government-funded programs.  Rather that there is a burgeoning global market for these technologies, Canada has a highly trained life-sciences educated population that we're currently just losing to the US.  This is one of the areas that if we invested in now we could be a powerhouse in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a little late to the party for anyone to see this, but I think it's going to be **poverty**.

I could quote a [bunch of statistics](http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats) about how many children are currently in poverty, food production vs. those going hungry, etc.  Chances are you've heard it before, know it's a problem, and shrug it off as unavoidable.  Scarcity economics after all is the basic tenant of our global society, and many governments already invest a lot into social programs for various issues.  However, the number of [people living in poverty is increasing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States), so the problem is actually getting worse.

Reddit has seen a lot more discussion of [income inequality](http://youtu.be/JTj9AcwkaKM) in recent years, I think a possible program that is going to increase in popularity in the future is the idea of getting rid of poverty by systems like 'minimum income', or the 'reverse income tax'.  There are several of these proposed systems that work in different ways to offset negative incentive effects to personal economics.  However, they're all often tossed out as simply 'just giving money to poor people' and a lot of 'give someone a fish, vs. teach someone to fish BS'.

<TEXT>  American's can't afford their own goods. So them threatening to cut off a market as big as Canada's would be near suicidal for any business at the moment

It would hurt them immensely, but it wouldn't be suicidal.  For us it would be suicidal.  A big agenda item of the CPC is to divest Canada from its dependence on the American economy.  If new trade agreements with BRIC countries avoids strenuous copyright and IP and helps us achieve that goal, your domestic goal would be realized.  Harper does seem to favour bilateral agreements over things like TPP, so it's a real possibility.

You might find some [inspiration in this story](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/05/03/180912847/episode-224-the-cotton-wars).  It was all about how Brazil managed to out-maneuver the cotton-lobby in the USA.

<TEXT> Okay, but to be devil's advocate here.  Well, not really devil, let's say the pragmatist's advocate.  How are you going to advocate to Canadian politicians that the value of your proposed policy reforms to IP and copyright outweighs the vested interests of the US entertainment lobby?

[The USA receives 73% of our exports, and we buy 63% of our imports from them (merchandise, not services)](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/trad45a-eng.htm).  The US could simply *threaten* retaliatory action on our goods and services and it would cripple our economy.

I'm not saying your reforms aren't worthwhile or just, but I am saying the scope shouldn't be domestic Canadian policy, but international trade.  Like you said, China, Russia, Brazil and India, the largest emerging economies on the planet have little interest in adhering to western copyright and IP laws.  

If you structure the economic arguments of your policy reforms around achieving free-trade agreements with those countries, enshringing relaxed IP and copyright regulations (rather than TPP and the EU trade deal going on), then you might have a chance.

However, again, to make domestic policy changes in Canada, I'm convinced you first have to make it economically viable for Canada to piss off the USA, which right now is unrealistic, if not impossible.

Canada doesn't want strict IP and copyright.  The bill we ended up getting was actually pretty generous compared to the DMCA. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Money for that research *sometimes* comes from federal grants

Gross domestic expenditures for research and development (GERD) federally in 2010 accounted [for over 20% of all funding](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/scte01a-eng.htm).  Provincial funding accounted for ~6%.  Institutions covered ~17% of funding, while business accounted for ~46%.

So, a lot of the money for pure research *does* come from federal grants. More than the two examples you have provided combined.

 The question is whether or not pure research is being done in Canada. The answer is yes, in universities.

The question isn't whether pure research is being done, the question is whether *less* will be done by these policies.  Clearly, if a major source of funding for this work will be further partitioned to business-related research, which already makes up half of all GERD, apparently with limited results, then the answer is yes, less pure research will be conducted.

In all seriousness though, I'm just saying that if the total annual budget for federal research funding remains the same, or is reduced, and at the same time the NRC executive is directed to more strategically direct funding towards 'economically viable research', then some pure research that might have traditionally been granted funding won't occur.  That research is where the accidental eurekas that change the world occur.

Some research doesn't sound so fancy when it's first being proposed.  [Gregor Mendel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel) did nothing but make observations of pea-plants for years and it wasn't till after his death that he became famous as the father of genetics.  </TEXT>

I don't think the concern is that business or industry is evil in any way.

However, I feel like a lot of pure research in math and science is conducted and then never applied until decades later, sometimes forgotten in the interim.

The answer isn't to remove funding from basic research to give towards research that appears more economically lucrative.  The answer is increased funding for *applications of research*, where entrepreneurs are given the training and resources to apply novel research to new markets and start new businesses. 

Trying to turn research towards business is a mistake.  Turning business and entrepreneurship towards research would be of greater benefit.

My argument might seem like semantics, but I don't believe it is. </TEXT>

Really, you shouldn't need a regulator in the first place to avoid making an unsafe design, that's what the engineers are for.  The NEB doesn't have those kinds of resources.  Engineers have an obligation to protect the public, not to please the regulator. 

However, mistakes happen, no design is perfect. It helps that regulators see all designs from all companies, which help shape their guidelines.

The problem here more realistically, is that Enbridge had a pump-station design that they cookie-cuttered over a hundred times before someone noticed a problem. It's a pretty common issue. </TEXT>

I remember working on a complaint from a regulator about a pipeline project, where the regulator basically had no teeth so the complaint had been ignored for years.  The regulator had noticed a problem on a line (that had already been built and was operating) a major failure possibility that had escaped everyone's notice.  The matter was easily resolved with a half-hour's work and a $50 valve, but it could have been a different story.

Regulators remind me of intelligence agencies in that the public rarely learns of their successes, only their failures. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You don't need a detailed study to determine that local demand for refined product is at least 1 order of magnitude too small to support a single multi-billion dollar refinery.

I'm assuming your comment is suggesting that the demand for these products is already near to where the existing north american refining capacity is.  

 Who is going to pay for that study? Because it would be a waste of money.

Parliament, April 2012.  Refer to [section 4.2](http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2012-27-e.pdf) (pdf) 

Recommend referring to Figure 4.  There seems to be some economic incentives of increased refining in Alberta.  However, it is cheaper (based on the report) to transport crude, rather than refined petroleum products though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Suggesting that if something doesn't exist, it must not be economically viable, because the market would already have produced it sounds too much like a tautology.

 The market should be able to find the most efficient way to extract the oil.

I think you might be failing to consider the role of government as an agent of capital investment in the free market.  The most efficient extraction techniques were derived by [research funded by government as well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_Oil_Sands_Technology_and_Research_Authority).

The short-term economics might favor simply selling synthetic crude by the Keystone pipeline to refineries in the US, or shipping it to markets in China by Northern-Gateway.  However, the long-term economics may favor Alberta selling fully refined petroleum products.  Furthermore, these two economic strategies are not  mutually exclusive.  The cost of developing new refining capability (and applying new technology developed since the existing refining plants in the US were built) may be too high to easily entreat private capital investment, despite economic opportunity.

Government has the power to be a very big fish in the ocean of capital investment.  It might not be efficient, but it has deep pockets (i.e. taxpayers), that benefit from such strategic investments in a market. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spending on social programs that would likely be supplanted or made obsolete by GMI would offset a number of the costs of such a program. Therefore such a policy could be spending-neutral.  Furthermore, Canada already possesses a system for redistributing tax-revenue to low-income earners, so there would be no additional bureaucracy to manage such a system.  The United States similarly maintains the [Earned Income Tax Credit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit).

Regarding your math, 27 million Canadians aren't beneath the poverty line.  Rather [9.4% of Canadians fall in that category](http://www.indexmundi.com/canada/population_below_poverty_line.html), therefore your estimate is off likely by a factor of 10.

<TEXT> So you're describing an integration of 'on demand streaming' with all potential video-related content without being device-specific.  It does seem like an inevitable result of where things are heading...

I've been giving some thought to this lately, because of the major problem with monetizing streaming and 'on demand' services.  Google seems to have finally achieved [strong revenues from YouTube](http://www.forbes.com/sites/connieguglielmo/2013/04/18/google-reports-first-quarter-profit-that-tops-analyst-estimates-shares-rise-live/), but for a long time the story was that they were losing money propping up the service.  

I think the major problem is that you can't staple boring content (ads) to interesting content and expect people to pay attention when it's not a passive service like tv.

I think a future online business model is going to be a marketplace where instead of having interesting content supported by ads, the content itself will be ads, which will be user-generated.  Content-creators will be rewarded (much like how YouTube does it now), for creating far more effective ads than the ones currently designed.

Look at how much motive there is just on reddit to accumulate fake internet points (karma), if users received monetary rewards for the content they linked and that content was interesting in its own right despite advertising some product or service, you would see very different behaviours.  I guess that's already true to an extent with some of the ads in reddit that look like posts and are usually for amazon content, with some ads getting voted up... </TEXT>

<TEXT>  and one of the things we're learning is just how different the non-adult brain is.

I can totally appreciate that.  It sounds like we both agree regarding dehumanizing activities, but depart at labels. 

Recognizing separate activities as both being acts of social violence shouldn't at all equate the seriousness of their direct consequences to victims involved.  

However, addressing 'root causes' is important for applying corrective action.  Will the policy put forward be to just put kids in jail, or to [teach them](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/dec/26/twitter-facebook-school-libel-lessons) years in advance to recognize certain behaviours as being explicitly wrong?  Our entire discussion-thread in a way has been a microcosm of the larger political dialogue that's been happening (more so regarding terrorism, not yet bullying, but it could likely head in that direction in the coming weeks). </TEXT>

I don't want to minimize the seriousness of bullying, but it's not apples and oranges. The psychology is the same.  To tolerate one in a civilized society and say "well that's what politicians sign up for," while decrying the harassment and isolation that youth go through, is hypocritical.

Bullying continues after highschool.  It happens in the workplace, in families.

It's poisonous for everyone.  Youth have the worst of it, there's no denying that, but you can't fix half the problem and expect to get anywhere.

<TEXT> On the contrary, I don't think bullying is ever going to go back to a marginalizing "kids will be kids" sentiment.  Rather, in getting serious about those issues within our society, it might lead to the public being more reflective on what is appropriate for communication between adults, particularly from public officials.  

It wasn't too long ago, I remember seeing[ Elizabeth May getting shouted down](http://youtu.be/Ga8c0Hd6oCo) during question period, unable to finish her question.  I think most people came away from that and similar situations saying "well MPs will be MPs," and "that's how it's always been," and the whole business about three sword-lengths distance between the seats.

<TEXT> Premise:  The ELA is being shut down not for economic reasons, or for performing research that's beyond the scope/mandate of the DFO, but as a response to ELA founder David Schindler's persistent and public criticism of the water-usage and downstream impacts of oil sands extraction and upgrading processes.

Argument: The economic reasoning for closing the ELA is fairly poor.  The operating costs for the station are relatively low, [$2M/year](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/03/19/experimental-lakes-area-tories-scientists_n_2910022.html).  Wheras the cost of closing and decommissioning the ELA is comparatively exorbitant [in excess of $25M](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/06/15/pol-experimental-lakes-area-budget-cuts.html).

Add to this expense the reputation-cost to Canada of closing it.  It makes us look bad, because it's more than just government research up there, they're halting experiments for [international researchers](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2013/03/20/pol-ela-scientists-contact-dfo-for-closure-confirmation.html) and a ton of their grad-students by doing this.  So why do it?  Middle of nowhere, relatively low operational cost, few active on-site personnel... 

The founder of the ELA is a world-renowned scientist, David Schindler.  He's highly respected, and probably one of the most vocal critics of [water-usage by oilsands operations](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2010/10/15/f-david-schindler.html).  

Prof. Britt Hall, an associate professor of biogeochemistry at the University of Regina:
 *"The fact that demolition work has started on cabins at the ELA site is a sign the federal government is not trying in good faith to find a new operator."*  

The criticism seems to be that negotiations are slow, secretive, and [not being made in good faith](http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/doubt-real-effort-to-get-new-operator-200996581.html).  The DFO maintains its line that the [ELA doesnt fit within their mandate](http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.com/2012/10/19/environment-canada-urged-to-take-on-ela), but the political capital being spent to weather shutting this station down is becoming significant.

Despite all this though, I think the CPC is going to look at this as a way out, while still saving face.  They know otherwise it's not going to go away and the media is going to keep hitting them with a sob-story that is going to stink to a lot of voters and it's time to get some distance from it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At my highschool, all the classrooms had these heavy CRT televisions suspended up high and every day there were these scheduled "video announcements".  There were also like thirty of these televisions in the cafeteria, but more of that anon. 

Normally, the vice-principal would get on the PA and let the teachers know to turn on their televisions for the daily video announcement.  This was grade 11 for me (one year before graduation), and it was near the end of the school year, so as was customary there were a fair number of pranks from the graduating class going on.  I don't even know if half of them actually happened, but I remember hearing they released three pigs in the school at one point, with the numbers "1", "2" and "4" painted on them, so that the administrators would be running around looking for a non-existent #3 pig.  

Anyway, on this particular day, the vice-principal gets on the PA and says "**Teachers, DO NOT turn on your televisions**".  My bio teacher was this young hip lady, who upon hearing this went straight to the television saying "Well now I *have* to turn it on".  So she hits the power button and sure enough it's some super-hardcore pornography that one of the graduating students had put on the daily announcements after locking himself in the audio-visual room.  You could see everything, it was **GRAPHIC** and my teacher was so shocked it took her a good 5 seconds to hit the power-button again and turn it off.  It was a very Sir Patrick Stewart moment (i.e. "I've seen everything"). 

My best friend got into class late that day nearly pissing his pants laughing.  He had just come from the cafeteria where a bunch of teachers had been desperately jumping up to turn off the thirty odd TVs, suspended high up all over the big room, including the vice principal who must have been barely over 5' tall.

Pretty funny, I remember some of the more religious kids who presumably had never witnessed sex before all having little freak-outs; it was quite the 'to do' for a long time after, though the kid who did it got in deep crap.  

**TL;DR: Kid pranks highschool daily video announcements with hardcore porn, hilarity ensues.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Patents are unfortunately the cart preceding the regulatory horse.  Pharma products, particularly biopharma can take upwards of 15 years *after* a patent is approved before they can typically receive FDA approval.  It's a ton of really expensive testing and trials.  However, lot of it can be supplanted with computer models today though.  This will likely be the basis for regulatory reform in this industry eventually, allowing more rapid innovation and less expensive drugs.

Technically, you could separate patent-protection into two stages, first being development stage, followed after by a temporary market monopoly stage.  

This would be a nice adjustment to avoid patent trolls, because if an organization failed to commercialize their product they would have no claims against a company actively selling a product on their alleged IP after the expired term.  It would also be a good incentive for companies to actively seek to commercialize their patented technologies, rather than simply patenting them and letting the technology languish. </TEXT>

I mean, if someone develops a really innovative augmented reality product, or industrial automation product (i.e. not just another phone, camera, etc.), they ought to enjoy increased licensing benefits for a reasonable period of time after.  

A full decade might be too long, especially if the rate of innovation continues to increase.  So perhaps patent-legislation should be devised with flexible metrics to determine their length with respect to the pace of innovation in the industry to which they apply. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With respect to copyright, I think it's pretty well out of control the length of time a work remains outside the public domain.  At this point I feel like they should just give Disney an exemption already and stop punishing the public at large to satisfy them.  If an author is dead, I don't feel like I should be paying their grandchildren for the intellectual property.  [The Happy Birthday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You#Copyright_status) song is a pretty good example of this.  (written in the mid 19th century, copyrighted in 1935, current copyright still active and held by Time Warner, hence why they don't sing it in restaurants anymore...)

In terms of competition and innovation, there are areas of intellectual property law and patent law that could definitely be changed to help spur growth.  One big problem area in patent laws is there's no distinction between different industries; the same patent-lengths hold for the tech-industry (rapid cycle from product to market) as well as the biotech industry (slow cycle from product to market).  

Biotech, particularly pharmaceuticals, is a nightmare to try and have a start-up in.  If you discover something with awesome therapeutic potential and manage to patent it, it will take on average 10-15 years before you can clear regulatory hurdles and bring your product to market.  Then by the time you have people buying it at an exorbitant cost to pay back all the cost of development, suddenly the patent expires and generics (or for bio-drugs 'subsequent entry biologics') hit the market and undercut you.  Currently, most venture capital in North America goes to [bigger companies doing biotech](http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Industries/Life-Sciences/Beyond-borders--global-biotechnology-report-2011), because smaller companies just can't sustain themselves.  

Tech-sector products on the other hand, even hardware, can go from inception to market much more rapidly, and patents on these products extend to the point of being obselete, as evidenced by the glut of lawsuits between tech-companies, all owning thousands of overlapping patents.

Tech-sector patents should be shortened to 10 years, and biotech patents should either be extended or the regulatory process should be overhauled (or both).  Similar adjustments should be made on a per-industry basis with flexibility in the legislation to account for rapidity of innovation in the particular sector. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regarding your point#2, I'm not completely in favor of making downloading legal without introducing some means restitution fee for artists and content-creators.  

While I think that downloading is really more of a service/convenience problem than a "free-stuff" problem, I'd like to see Canada introduce a levy to redistribute funds back to artists and content creators.  I'm not a fan of the [blank media levy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_copying_levy#Canada) introduced in 1997, I'd like to see it charged from internet service providers (w/o raising rates on consumers), since they're already gouging Canadians as it is.

Also, highly recommend reading stuff from [Michael Geist](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6692/125/) if you're not already familiar with him.  And, rather than starting your own petition, you could consider volunteering to help [Open Media](http://openmedia.ca/) as they're pretty well in line with your copyright convictions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same with senate reform, and a few others.  If it came down to keeping a promise and losing power versus scraping a promise and keeping power, the latter will more likely win out.  Harper is a pragmatist, he would only need to establish a convenient reason for calling an early election.

It might be considered a pretty good argument that the conservatives may be expecting a stronger economy by 2015 and would still want to wait until then.  However, I think it would be more cunning to hold the election before the economy has fully recovered.  As long as the economy is on the minds of Canadians before various other concerns, the conservatives will hold a political advantage. </TEXT>

If I was Harper, I might seriously consider calling an early election in 2014.  Long enough to let the buzz about Justin simmer, but not so long for him to lose his 'inexperienced' image.  And, soon enough to quiet down the backbenchers. </TEXT>

Frankly, I'm not against developing the resources out there, but I am totally against giving companies a free pass on developing their engineering and processes to be cleaner and more efficient, and just accountable for the damage they cause.  Stricter regulation, as long as it doesn't defy economic realities is good for innovation.  

One of the biggest problems with the oil and gas industry, is that it favours robust 'working' solutions over innovative technology that's unproven.  Too much is accepted practice and a hundred little things add up to make for really dirty not-particularly-sustainable processes.  If these companies were really forced to tighten their processes, there would be a lot of fat available to trim. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The success of non-centerist parties notwithstanding, what kind of conflict and dialogue of political ideas will occur if each major party attempts to occupy the middle?

If it's all about perception and nothing to do with policy, I think Coyne is correct in saying the only distinguishing feature becomes party-leaders, and then parliament as it was designed and individual MPs become obselete.

I think parliament to remain effective in the future needs to retire geographical ridings, and elect all members on the basis of national popular vote with respect to issues.  Then you could elect a member who really cares about copyright reform, or one that insists on free trade, or a climate-change skeptic, or one that insists on tighter carbon emission controls. Parties would probably still exist somehow (they always survive) but there would be a return to electing individuals on the basis of an individual platform instead of a party platform.  </TEXT>

I'm curious what you think of the Liberals' leadership selection process allowing outside 'supporters'.  Specifically, what do you think the value/influence is for the Liberals in having email access to that group of voters, even the ones that haven't registered to actually vote?

As a follow-up question, while it's related to American politics, what do you think of the Whitehouse.gov using their petition system to more systematically target groups of voters on particular issues, and do you think one of the federal Canadian parties will try to implement a similar system for better sculpting their platforms?

So say a ministry of transportation, or medical information at a hospital, or prisoners in the justice system.  The way we organize people through our social institutions has a lot of room for overhaul to reduce overhead costs as technology improves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to think of it more in terms of social and organizational infrastructure.  

The inefficiency of any bureaucracy tends to increase over time leading to stagnation.  This is true for more than just governments, look at inefficiency and overhead of some older companies compared to newer ones and the differences can be pretty dramatic.

All these budget-cuts by the current administration, while having a negative direct effect to services will ultimately spur the creation and development of new and more efficient social infrastructure for delivering services.

<TEXT>  he calls the decision "completely unfair"

I listened to the interview, while he's definitely expressing an opinion, he offers very good points and evidence, so once again I wouldn't say his communication in inaccurate, simply unflattering. 

There's a bit of an ethical paradox here, because on one hand as a government employee it's not appropriate to go on the news and criticize government policy (of which you're technically a representative).  However, it's also not appropriate to remain silent to policy changes that will be harmful to the public and essential services like legal-aid, since ultimately the duty of a public servant is to the public.  It's essential that that information reach the electorate, and even though it's not the role of a government employee to perform this communication, it is the role of a public servant to do so.

In the first of these circumstances (gov't employee criticizing gov't), frankly it's healthy for a government to suffer criticism - whether from media, ordinary citizens, even its own employees - despite its political inconvenience.  It may seem inappropriate, but there's no other realistic way for a gov't employee on the ground, independent of party affiliation, to affect policy up the chain.

In the second of these circumstances (gov't employee withholding 'sensitive' information from the public), it's not healthy to the public to wait for ordinary citizens to be in danger of hypothetically bad policy, when knowledgeable public servants could offer warning against those policies.  

If the reality is that that communication has to be done through the media, rather than less-sensitive back-channels, it ought to be accepted, because the greater harm to the public is in withholding information, and the greater robustness of the political system is in receiving genuine criticism, even from gov't employees (which is probably even more valuable since it's less politically motivated than something coming from the opposition in question period). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That doesn't mean that they can't give an accurate assessment of the situation. But they need to stick to "just the facts, ma'am"

I read the [first article](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2013/04/02/nl-legal-aid-justice-cuts.html) where the lawyer's views are first quoted.  I would hazard that the points he makes aren't inaccurate, simply unflattering.


 they still have a duty to support the decisions of the duly elected government.

Is this in fact the case?  Isn't the duty towards the public?  While these are government employees, if policy changes affect their ability to perform essential services to the public, communicating those facts to the public should be protected under whistle-blowing rules.

I would suggest this situation is not unlike closing a hospital for a rural population and then having a doctor suspended for telling the CBC there won't be enough equipment or personnel to treat the general population. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been considering this problem, because I recognize that when gov't employees (scientists or in this case a legal-aid lawyer) communicate to the media and the public, they become in a way de facto representatives of the government. This is problematic when the government wants to manage its communication and messaging (which it understandably wants to do), and someone seen as representing the gov't 'goes rogue' and starts criticizing policy.

However, these are servants for the public, not the governing administration, and if there's a legitimate concern to the public well-being from policy decisions, I'm tempted to suggest the speech and criticism by public employees should be protected under whistle-blower rules.

The problem seems to be that there aren't clear guidelines for gov't employees to represent their personal opinions and criticisms as separate from the governing administration.   </TEXT>

Really, though, it will be important to get Canadian oil to Asia and its developing economies, especially with the shale-oil boom in the states showing that they won't need to rely on our production.

The perceived risk means a political cost, which added to the monetary ones could make the whole thing nonviable though.  It's sort of like nuclear power, no matter how great the benefits, or how far the technology has come, when you have recent events like Fukushima, or bringing it back to coastal oil-spills, Deep Water Horizon (less than 3 years ago), winning people over becomes a pretty bleak affair.    </TEXT>

Geologists are definitely an outrageous group of people. :)

Those links in my previous comment suggest that the standard to which gov't scientists are being held isn't the norm.  Rather that researchers are just expected to follow certain guidelines when communicating publicly.  

Even taking the whole muzzling thing as a complete fiction though, I have to wonder how much overhead and personnel are being devoted to media and communications bureaucracy to 'manage' all public communications.  Is it more than before these new rules came into place in 2006?  Is it worth avoiding a few embarrassing quotes and sound-bites here and there? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been considering this problem, because I recognize that when gov't scientists communicate directly to the public, they become *de facto* representatives of that government.  This is problematic if you want to exert control on government communication and messaging (which the gov't understandably wants to do).

However, I think if we're going to employ scientists directly (as opposed to research at a university for instance, where researchers are still funded by the gov't typically, but not directly employed by them) they shouldn't be more restricted than non-gov't researchers in their communications, i.e. peer review, unless it's classified military research (i.e. defence and weapons, etc.).  Otherwise, there's an ethical hazard not unlike the state possessing it's own news-media that only reports news that reflects positively on the government or party in power, symptomatic of dictatorships...

Therefore, I think research directly sponsored by the gov't should be carried out by an independent body from the bureaucracy and parliament, subject to oversight and audit, but representing neither.

IMHO: the independence of scientific research should be protected the same as the independence of the Bank of Canada or the judicial branch. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Worse, it implies that government policy (ought statements) are ultimately able to be based on scientific evidence (is statements). This is a favorite trick of the left, to assume their ideological premises so strongly that they genuinely begin to believe that they aren't in fact ideological.

I would think historically, a fair amount of government policy is based in facts and evidence, which should circumvent any left-leaning or right-leaning ideology.  As an example, free trade agreements removing tariffs, while initially rejected at the time by left-leaning ideologies, was supported by economists and ultimately helped spur new economic growth.  Hence why PM Harper in his tenure has really put a lot of effort into getting Canada at the table for new agreements to open trade markets in Asia and Europe and diversify our economy from just the US, whose market we depend on too heavily.

Evidence is objective, and a good foundation for policy.  

That being said, I'll agree, this motion is more an opposition stunt, less about protecting scientific evidence than criticizing the government:

* Part (a) isn't really binding, anyone could agree to that.  
* Part (b) is problematic, because controlling communication and messaging so well has been a very politically profitable maneuver for the CPC and the PMO, you can hardly blame them for controlling their message, this is politics after all...  However, it is an important question how much control is appropriate for the ruling party to exert over the state bureaucracy.  Realistically, there should be some independence of the bureaucracy (incl. gov't scientists) from the politics of the day...
* Part (c) is really just an attention-grabber, since the ELA project has gotten a lot of media attention.  Realistically, the project could be totally bloated and not a realistic approach to the research they set out to conduct, and not worth continuing, no matter how expensive the initial cost of clean-up in the short-term. </TEXT>

I suppose action of [hormonal contraception (i.e. the birth control pill)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_contraception) is to temporarily halt these hormone shifts.  I wonder if there are any animals in nature that have a once-in-a-lifetime (or at least once-a-year) mating cycle, the best example I can think of now is salmon.

Though, if sexual reproduction in humans became a once-in-a-year thing, it would probably have a lot of sociological implications, unless the same sex-drive in individuals was maintained.

Altogether, it would be a complex issue to address.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a time when we made more contributions to the UN missions than any other country (in the 90s).  After Sept 11, though, we were more attached to NATO missions than UN peacekeeping operations.  

All of the peacekeeping operations would have had to be sold to the Canadian public, since the expense was likely significant, and it was at a time when Canada's national debt was a concern (hence a hypothetical mythology).  However, there must have been some foreign policy positives to our investing so heavily in peace-keeping. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on how you qualify "power" I suppose.  There was that period after WWII where we had pretty [significant air and naval assets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Forces#Origins_and_establishment).  This qualified us as a middle-power at the time in terms of military capability. 

 At the end of the Second World War, Canada possessed the third-largest navy and fourth-largest air force in the world, as well as the largest volunteer army ever fielded. Conscription for overseas service was introduced only near the end of the war, and only 2,400 conscripts actually made it into battle

During the early part of the cold war, we also [possessed nuclear armaments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Inventory_of_Canada.E2.80.99s_nuclear_armaments). 

With respect to international diplomacy and influence, when Canada was synonymous with [peace-keeping](http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnmilitary/peacekeeping.html), we could have been considered a middle-power in this respect.  However, our military assets would have been much diminished from their earlier levels.

Today, economically we're still a middle-power; members of the [G8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8), despite its exclusion of Brazil and China, such as it is... </TEXT>

<TEXT> A response from a friend who's a Canadian Social Worker:

He's a very engaging speaker and his opening metaphor comparing the welfare system to the bleeding patient scenario is very apt. 

I agree wholeheartedly with his assertions that poverty is the root of many social challenges that government programs attempt to address, that a new approach (as opposed to tinkering with the current ones) is needed, and that the government has traditionally been more interested in institutionalizing poverty than eradicating it. 

Having said that - and he alludes to this later on - the social problems caused by poverty also cause poverty in a nasty little loop, so programs to address them must still exist. This means that, in his cost/benefit analysis of an income supplement, the costs of these programs can only be partially subtracted from the cost of the supplement and that additional money will have to be found to fund it. I do believe, however, that these costs will be recouped over time 
through the reduction of welfare program costs, health care costs, and other costs to government (as Segal talks about). I also believe that initial costs would have to include "navigation aides" - workers to help individuals in low income (especially in intergenerational poverty) to learn to access systems they have previously had little interaction with due to lack of income (ie: education, credit, etc.) in order to reach their goals. This does not neccessarily have to be new workers dedicated to the income supplement program, but it may be wise during the transition from welfare. In addition, and after these workers are no longer needed, these system navigation tools could be taught as part of secondary education, be offered through pre-existing programs (such as student loan offices, credit counselling, etc), and incorporated into government service offices in much the same; way as learning to fill out a driver's license renewal, etc.

In the same vein, using the tax system to deliver the supplement is a great idea because it will reduce administrative costs and, hopefully, a lot of confusion while increasing the respect of the individuals by not "othering" them into a seperate system from "regular" Canadians. However, at least at the beginning, a recruitment system will be needed to get Canadians living in low income who do not file taxes due to lack of income to do so. 

I agree with the idea of a general income supplement for all of the reasons he discusses. I do think it's failed in the past, and continues to be unpopular beacuse of the conservative values that judge poverty as a result of a lack of personal responsibility or deficiency - the view he describes in his contrasting of left and right. I think a good way to circumnavigate this is to "sell" it to conservatives using a cost/benefit analysis as he begins to here. His logic and examples are good - but in order to really sell it, you'll need harder numbers. 
Attempts to reverse these judgements have existed for decades, but a marketing campaign to remove the stigma around poverty may also be neccessary to sway public opinion and get this off the ground. 

On a related note, all of his descriptions of the welfare system as needlessly confusing, punitive, judgemental, offensive, and demeaning are spot on. 

So, in general, I agree, and hopefully more people will seriously consider this and other new approaches to poverty eradication. 

Sorry for the long response, but you asked for it, and as you'll recall from the lecture, poverty is a very "complex" issue. Thanks for the link, I enjoyed watching it. 

As a side note, I also love the Gardiner museum and had no idea they hosted nifty lectures . </TEXT>

He made a number of really interesting sociological arguments about how the numerous programs designed to help abate poverty actually lead to a marginalization of those who use them.  Plus the economic arguments of bureaucracy associated with delivery of those programs that don't successfully mitigate the problems of poverty. 

I wish Sen Segal was still in the lower house, he seems like a very interesting guy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, it definitely has been a fringe issue to date, and coming out in favor of it has the risks of marginalizing the party that tries with the negative pro-pot connotations of past elections.  It would be a serious message-war, I cringe imagining the political ads.

However, if it has relatively broad appeal, as it seems to now in polls, and if more than one opposition party comes out in favor of at least decriminalization, it could become main stream and 'ok' rather than some fringe policy.  Then, an alternative narrative marginalizing prohibitive policy could potentially win out.

Colorado and Oregon lend a lot of legitimacy to this issue moving away from the fringe, and there could be more state referendums in the US during the 2014 elections. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The legalization of marijuana could end up being an interesting wedge issue in 2015 between the CPC and the other federal parties (assuming legalization is adopted by any opposition platforms).  

The CPC is pretty well tied policy-wise to a 'tough on crime' agenda and highly unlikely to flip on legalization.

As such, they're stuck with only one play of demonizing the use of marijuana as well as the idea of legalization to voters; marginalizing any of its proponents.  Strategically then, if opposition communication is prepared ahead of time and can out-maneuver these tactics, they could come out ahead on this issue (provided the votes play out with the current demographics).

It would be interesting to see polls on legalization specific to ridings won by the CPC in 2011. </TEXT>

In a 4 to 3 decision, the Court found the Acts violated Quebeckers' right to life and security of person under the Quebec Charter. The ruling is binding only in Quebec. Three of the seven judges also found that the laws violated section seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Id consider the possibility of adding a clause to the Charter that would necessitate something along the lines of a political questions doctrine, while admitting that such a clauses application would be kinda messy.

Could you elaborate on this? I assume you're referring to [this feature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_question) of american constitutional law (from the Wikipedia entry):

 In American Constitutional law, the *political question doctrine* is closely linked to the concept of justiciability, as it comes down to a question of whether or not the court system is an appropriate forum in which to hear the case. This is because the court system only has authority to hear and decide a legal question, not a political question. Legal questions are deemed to be justiciable, while political questions are nonjusticiable.  

Which decisions by the SCC might have qualified as political questions? </TEXT>

* PM Harper has made the [last five appointments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada#Current_members_of_the_Court) to the Supreme Court, and will make two more when [Louis LeBel](http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/ju/lebel/index-eng.asp) and [Morris Fish](http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/ju/fish/index-eng.asp) hit their mandatory retirements; has the general character and decisions of the bench changed much since 2006?
* Do you think the process for judicial appointments in Canada could ever become as politicized as it is in the USA? 
* Prior to passage of the charter, was the SCC still a pretty big deal?

I'd love to take one of your courses, would you recommend any for non-polisci ppl?  Or, possibly just buy you a beer over at Kickoffs sometime, hope you like Waterloo so far, thanks again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> While this matter seems topical to Ontario right now, the subject of privatization of public corporations is an important political subject at various levels of gov't across Canada.  

Furthermore, liquor privatization, while in this case it's a provincial matter in Ontario, it's a question with precedence in Alberta where it was privatized in 1993-94, making it a good topic for making comparisons of results.

If public opinion allowed the sale of the LCBO today, it could signal to the CPC and other political parties that it's safe for them to make similar attempts at other [remaining crown corporations in Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_corporations_of_Canada#List_of_Canadian_Crown_corporations). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't familiar with the [Greenbelt](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/11/20/toronto-greenbelt-expansion.html), thanks for bringing it to my attention.

As for whether the sale of the LCBO~~/beer-store~~ would increase government revenue, I mentioned these possibilities:

 If the LCBO and beer store were sold off, the initial revenues of the sale and the economic boost of new companies entering the market may actually increase provincial revenues in the long term (the effects should be predictable, however, for whatever policy is better I think). This is also to say nothing of the effect loosening alcohol regulations on sales of alcohol (i.e. being able to buy a beer down at the corner store) would have on revenues.

There's probably an independent report floating around somewhere... here's one from [1994](http://www.yorku.ca/nuri/lcbo.htm) done by a prof [Nuri T. Jazairi](http://people.laps.yorku.ca/people.nsf/researcherprofile?readform shortname=nuri) in the economics department at YorkU.  Perhaps outdated, but sounds like privatization doesn't win out: (from conclusions sect. 17)

 Under liquor control, revenues are greater and prices are lower than under privatization, other things being equal, because of economies of scale. The privately-owned outlets are fragmented, and require higher rates of return on their capital costs than control boards. 

 Selling the LCBO to private owners would not help in reducing the provincial debt because LCBO assets are a small amount relative to the $80 billion debt.

 Privatization in Alberta has resulted in higher product prices, smaller product selection, higher warehousing and distribution costs, and higher social costs. Alberta Premier Ralph Klein has conceded that the ALCB privatization is "counterproductive".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll admit, when I consider alcohol privatization, I'm taking the perspective more of an average cough consumer...  :)

Monopolizing alcohol distribution puts ~~inherant restrictions on the varieties of beers and liquors and spirits that can be marketed~~ (**Edit:** Apparently overall variety can be measurably higher under a public system, I was considering more small businesses with more niche selections, but that result isn't necessarily a foregone conclusion of privatization).  Makes it more difficult for smaller and regional breweries to enter the market.  

If the LCBO and beer store were sold off, the initial revenues of the sale and the economic boost of new companies entering the market  may actually increase provincial revenues in the long term (the effects should be predictable, however, for whatever policy is better I think).

<TEXT> I agree, a lot of our government structure is based on [tradition, convention etc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system)  It would be nice if we could innovate government the same way we do anything else.

I read this great series of books about [setting up a government on Mars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy) after the first colonies are settled there.  Really made me consider how obtuse some of our conventions are becoming over time.  I made this comment in another thread yesterday:

 I've been considering lately whether federal politics should continue to be driven by a system of local geographical ridings. Why not have a system (especially with the internet today) where if a person can get a certain number of votes nationally, whether in a local city/town or broadly from across several provinces they would be awarded a seat in the HoC.
Municiple and provincial politics could continue to be run the same way, but nationally I feel like I might have more in common with people in Newfoundland and Vancouver than my direct Neighbourhood about who I want representing my interests nationally.

I'd rather vote with you Palpz on putting a representative in the HoC than my neighbours that I've (perhaps ashamedly) never met.

<TEXT> Constitutional changes are actually enormously difficult, the failure of the last two big pushes for constitutional changes, the [Meech Lake Accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meech_Lake_Accord) and the [Charlottetown Accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottetown_Accord) are pretty good evidence of that.  I worry sometimes with how rapidly the world is changing that there aren't more flexible gov't mechanisms to make adjustments.  

That being said, Chrtien [made a good point](http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/chrtien-criticizes-quebec-culture-of-grievance-over-82-constitution/article4100813/?service=mobile) earlier this year when he said:

<TEXT> I like your suggestion that increased urbanization alone is a potential factor on median male incomes due to competition.  That would actually make for a good economics study I think.  

I don't believe his measurements of innovation are necessarily accurate either, it's a little too anecdotal to say we're not as innovative as 50 years ago just because consumer goods and appliances remain fairly pedestrian compared to their counterparts from the 50s.  Biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials; there are research areas exploding right now, they just aren't as visible as the consumer electronics handset market.  

However an interesting topic brought up briefly in the talk and not really discussed at length is the fact that with tomorrow's innovations in automation a large portion of traditional unskilled labor will disappear.  Standard of living should still be high, I imagine, but what the average individual will do for a living could be very different... As an example of this, imagine those google self-driving cars, now apply that to the trucking and shipping industry.  A fleet of trucks with no drivers that can go 24h/day.  If this technology is licensed, suddenly every trucker in the world has to figure out what they're going to do now.  

So, where increased competition could be mistaken for stagnation, what will obsolescence look like... </TEXT>

So much of the food produced in north america right now doesn't get purchased and eventually just gets chucked out.

If less of the current food production can be used to satisfy the needs of more people in this manner (i.e. less waste), that leaves room for a lot more freedom in how food is grown.  Biodiversity, organic production, environmentally conscious farming...  A lot of negative aspects of agriculture today are driven by a persistent global food shortage.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regarding 3D printing and automation: 
 
* That level of automation frightens me a little in and of itself.  When we've reached that point you realize traditional labour on earth will have disappeared.  I don't know what most people will be doing for a living by that point, unless 3D printing and distributed manufacturing becomes a success (as per next point).
* 3D printing is definitely an exciting prospect, if only because the business model around small-scale distributed manufacturing vs. traditional large-scale mass-production adds the potential for so much creativity and diversity in the stuff we have around us.  I really want one of [these](http://www.wired.com/design/2012/09/how-makerbots-replicator2-will-launch-era-of-desktop-manufacturing/). :)

Regarding privatization of space:

* This also makes me nervous, but at the same time, if there aren't commercially viable reasons to go out there, then we will probably never go and that would be the real tragedy.  
* A frightening idea to consider is how if space exploration does 'take off' in the 21st century, it will primarily be developed nations that go, and as such developing countries may be forced permanently into a back-seat role economically, and social inequalities could multiply in severity.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is disappointing that funding over time has been curbed, but a lot of western countries have struggled with where to take their space programs in the last couple decades.

The [Canadarm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm) is a good example of how on a limited budget, but with a clear focus and project goals, we can still make a real contribution to space exploration.

Another good example is the [MELISSA long term life-support system](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Melissa/) that was pioneered by the European Space Agency.

With various agencies taking on different parts of the puzzle on how to successfully traverse space, a lot of headway can still be made.

The emergence of private companies in the US like [SpaceX](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/10/spacex-iss-cargo/) and the proposed asteroid mining company [Planetary Resources](http://www.planetaryresources.com/asteroids/) adds a new and exciting dimension with the prospect of commercialized space exploration.  Hopefully similar start-ups can occur in Canada possibly beginning through the CSA... </TEXT>

<TEXT> My lab mates and I are at a Chemical Engineering conference and the subject of the spherical chicken in a vacuum "Why did the chicken cross the road?" Physics joke came up.

For chemical engineering, I thought it was clear there must have been a "Chicken gradient" that was producing the effect.

<TEXT> I really like reddit; I get reddit.  There's a community, people rattle off ridiculous puns like they're going out of style.  Interesting links, there's karma, I'm happy.

I really don't get Twitter yet.  

I don't want to be one of those people that writes off Twitter as some bizarre internet fad that doesn't really make any sense.  I suspect that there must be some merit to it.  So, lately I've been giving it a try, started "following" a bunch of people I know, as well as some funny actors (Simon Pegg), cool authors (Cory Doctorow, Brandon Sanderson), comedians (Chris Hardwick), relevant politicians, etc.

Is there other stuff you can do with Twitter that'll make it more of an experience? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always avoided reading science fiction novels, but I picked up Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card a couple years ago, and it really changed my mind about the whole genre.  Since then I've read some Sci-Fi like Asimov, William Gibson, Rant by Chuck Palahniuk was pretty cool. 

If you had to choose what would you say was the coolest Time-Travel novel you ever came across?
