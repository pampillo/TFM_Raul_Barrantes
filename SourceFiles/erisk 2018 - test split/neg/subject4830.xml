<TEXT> This reminds me of a story about [Mother Teresa](https://valerietarico.com/2013/04/29/self-flagellation-and-the-kiss-of-jesus-mother-teresas-attraction-to-pain/)

 One day I met a lady who was dying of cancer in a most terrible condition. And I told her, I say, You know, this terrible pain is only the kiss of Jesus  a sign that you have come so close to Jesus on the cross that he can kiss you. And she joined her hands together and said, Mother Teresa, please tell Jesus to stop kissing me.

I've heard Catholics say "Jesus is testing me" while they are in a difficult part of life. That one has always made my skin crawl. I've never understood this logic. What is the test? How does one even pass it? My best guess is that people think some horrible problem, such as a loved one dying, is actually a secret test by Jesus to ensure the person being tested actually keeps on believing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Single payer can work in America, and it can work without screwing the healthcare industry by expecting them to all take a big pay cut or shareholders in healthcare companies getting a huge decrease in stock value.

It also doesn't need to be some socialistic government takeover of a trillion dollar industry.

It's a math problem.

Currently, those of us with health care pay a lot of money for that insurance in premiums, co-pays, etc. A family of four can expect to pay over $1000 a month just to have insurance. We need to spread that cost around to everyone. That's why the Affordable Care Act has a provision where people must get insurance or pay a fine.

Some people get better rates if they work for a large company. The company has the leverage to negotiate better rates and they can also spread the cost across their many healthy employees defraying the cost of their few sick employees.

At its core, single payer means a single pool of people. Instead of one person buying insurance directly, another person in a small business getting insurance with a few other employees, and some giant company getting plans for all their employees, instead we all pay into the same place.

Where is becomes a math problem, and a solvable math problem, is how we spread the cost around. Let's use the $1000/month for a family of four, for $250 per person. Let's say that's what it really costs for a big healthcare provider to cover four people, so they can pay their doctors and staff what they are paying now, and their shareholders make some money. Instead of each family paying in based on separately negotiated rates, we all pay into a common pool via taxes. This could be by expanding Medicare, or creating a new pool. There would be some difference in what each family pays based on their income level. What's important is the math. Using the $250 per person * 321 million Americans, that's the amount of money we need in the pool each year. If you work at a minimum wage job, you pay less than $250. If you are a Fortune 500 CEO, you pay more. The $250 number might go down once we are all in the same pool, and all spreading the cost around. No more having people who pay for insurance having to pick up some of the cost for people who show up at the ER with no insurance.

Again, it's math. The percentages can be sliced and diced and endlessly debated in Congress, but at the end of the day, if you have enough money in the single payer pool, both the minimum wage person and the 1% person can walk into their local United Healthcare, Blue Cross, or other provider and sign up for coverage. The company bills the single payer pool $250 per person. That amount should provide for at least basic healthcare. What defines basic healthcare would also be an endless debate, co-pays, deductibles, etc. There could still be supplemental healthcare on top of the basic single payer. Employers could still offer that as a benefits. It could lower co-pays and deductibles and cover more medical issues.

Keeping our society health does benefit everyone. CEOs have a healthier workforce, and healthy consumers who can stay employees and buy more stuff. It could also cut down on expensive medical procedures if people could go to the doctor at minimal cost when they first get sick.

This single payer system isn't all that different from how Social Security works, or Medicare for old people, or unemployment insurance. We all pay into those programs out of our paychecks, and at a percentage based on our income level. The reason people keep saying Social Security is running out of money is again, a math problem, we collectively pay in less money that we collectively take out. Sure, I'm ignoring the political reality of voters getting upset with they have to pay more and/or receive less, but as they say "money doesn't grow on trees". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't read JPII "theology of the body" but I have gotten into a number of debates with Catholics around the topic of sexuality and "natural law" which is another underpinning of Catholic philosophy. I'm no expert in all this, but what it seems to come down to is that sex is used to make babies, and that keeps our species going. Any other use of sex is therefor bad/less pure/less holy, especially if it goes against the idea of making babies. This is where they derive the Catholic opposition to birth control, sex acts that can't lead to babies, same sex relationships, etc.

There are people who can go on and on about this natural law argument and see it as a pretty iron clad "logical" argument.

While I certainly wouldn't argue that sex can be used for making babies, it's also not the only reason to have sex or enjoy sex. There is plenty of medical evidence showing other benefits of sex, either with someone else or by yourself. Just because a baby doesn't come out of it doesn't seem particularly relevant to me.

I really don't get why something needs to have one and only one use or primary purpose, as natural law arguments would make. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Not so fast](http://www.archindy.org/holyyearofmercy/indulgence.html)

 The Holy See has designated four ways that Catholics may receive a plenary indulgence during the Holy Year of Mercy, which will begin on Dec. 8 and conclude on Nov. 20, 2016.

 Only one plenary indulgence may be received per day. A single participation in the sacrament of penance can apply to any reception of a plenary indulgence 20 days before or after going to confession. However, reception of Communion and praying for the intentions of the pope and the pope himself are required for each plenary indulgence.

I guess we missed out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope someone in the US military would risk being Court marshaled and tried for treason, and stand up to President Trump should he give the order to launch a nuke.

[This recent Radio Lab episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/nukes/) offers a sobering look at just how little legal ability any would have to stop the President should he decide to launch a nuke.

Part of the conventional Republican wisdom about: when doing poorly in the polls, bomb someone, I don't think that logic would hold up with nukes. Launching some cruise missiles into Syria or dropping some mega conventional bomb on ISIS in Afganistan, those have limited short term blow back. They aren't out of the ordinary, even with the Mother of All Bombs.

I just don't see how the same could be said for using a nuke. How could we possibly drop even one anywhere in the world and not get sucked into a huge international crisis? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Here's a question to you - if some (ill-informed) Catholic actually told a ex-Catholic relative that they were "going to hell," it would be painful to the ex? This is where it falls apart for me because if I don't believe in hell why is it painful if someone tells me I'm going there?

Would it be painful? Absolutely, why wouldn't it be? Sure, I don't think I am going to hell, but that fact that someone I love thinks I am screwed for all eternity, yeah, that does hurt. The hurt is tied into the idea of not being fully accepted and loved by your family.

<TEXT>  They become a mess when people enter the church as well.

I could see how that would be a difficult process too.

 And I don't understand what this means "and Catechism for what part the Church actually teaches, and what parts are just picked up along the way and not proper Catholic behavior." If you're willing to explain I'm willing to listen.

Basically, what I mean is, when people say stuff like: "ex Catholics are going to Hell" or "your marriage isn't a real marriage because it occurred outside the Church". Maybe those statements can be traced back to a section in the Catechism, or maybe those statements are just ideas that get propagated by other Catholics and not officially endorsed by the Church. The answer to that question isn't all that important to most ex Catholics. It just that it hurts to hear statements like that from people who you love and who are still a part of the Catholic Church.

<TEXT>  Do any of you understand the pain you cause your families?

I have gained a greater appreciation for that question as I have gotten older. I know my decision to leave the Church has caused a lot of pain in my family, and created a certain amount of distance between my mother and I. I do think we have healed much of that over time and over a number of conversations, but I doubt it will ever be fully healed.

As you say:

 I took it because I had to follow my conscience. My decision, my consequences.

I agree, I said much the same when it was my time to leave the Church. I needed to be true to myself. If I could have chosen otherwise, it would have saved me a lot of grief. I don't regret my decision to leave. I do regret some of the ways I initially handled it and have done what I can to resolve that.

I take most of my frustration with Catholics and Catholicism here to /r/excatholic and avoid posting the stuff I post here on Facebook where it will upset or offend Catholic family and friends. I've had enough of those arguments to know there really isn't much point to starting more. Earlier on I made some attempts to convert people to ex-Catholic status who just weren't interested. I regret that and no longer bring up those kinds of conversations. I think I am mostly fine with the religious choices other people make, as long as they aren't trying to force it on me.

Ultimately, I think these types of problems stem from the Church, and many religions, insistence on knowing **The Truth**. I get that for people who are followers of whichever religion, that does bring a certain amount of comfort, and a framework for how to live ones life. I felt some of the comfort when I was growing up and still very much a Catholic, and also a certain amount of condescension towards non-Catholics and ex-Catholics. It's all fine when you are in it, but it sure makes for a big mess when people decide to leave.

We can debate all you want, and parse the Bible and Catechism for what part the Church actually teaches, and what parts are just picked up along the way and not proper Catholic behavior. I don't think you will find much interest in those theological arguments here on /r/excatholic

<TEXT> I wonder what Trump voters are thinking and how they can still justify voting for him. I heard plenty of "he will blow it all up and start fresh", whatever the hell that means.

It is pretty crazy that a GOP Congress and President can't agree on hot button issues that get Republicans excited. I am convinced that Republicans don't want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They don't want to be held responsible for all the problems that would create. The have been complaining about Social Security for decades or overturning Roe. Obamacare is just another Republican dog whistle to get people to vote or donate money.

As much as I would like to see President Trump pushed out, I just don't see it happening with a Republican Congress. It's not like they don't already have enough reasons. If the midterms could sweep in enough Democrats... </TEXT>

Different strokes for different folks. I know people all across the spectrum, conservative Catholics, liberal Catholics who disagree with the Church on just about every hot-button social issue, and ex Catholics.

 20 years is a long time to be angry.

You should have seen me 20 years ago. I'm much better now.

<TEXT> I think the odds are pretty low.

From the US perspective, Trump does talk tough, but war with North Korea is a huge risk. It's not like bombing Syria or Afghanistan. There's a reason that previous US Presidents haven't attacked NK. There would likely be a large number of US casualties with the soldiers stationed in South Korea, and a large number of South Korean casualties. I could see public opinion in the US quickly turning against US military action.

For the NK perspective, they have been walking a fine line for a number of US Presidencies. Getting as close as possible with their provocative behavior, without starting another war. They may talk tough, but I gotta think they know how badly a military conflict with the US would go. What do they really have to gain?

<TEXT> Trump and Kim have both cultivated an unpredictable image. The big unknown is that neither have been pushed far enough where they need to follow through on their big threats and start shooting. It's really hard to say who will blink first in this game of chicken. In some ways, it doesn't matter who makes the first move. Once the shooting and missiles start, a lot of people will be killed on both sides of the DMZ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is asking for a whole lot of things to go right and very little to go wrong. One of the problems with North Korea is that have been making threats for years but they haven't had to go through with the threats. Who knows how tough, or crazy, they really are. It's possible that the US bombs sites in North Korea and North Korea backs down, but I still think it's a huge risk.

We have gotten this far with a mixture of diplomacy, sanctions, and threats. I would be more comfortable keeping that pressure up, and increasing the pressure on China to have them crack down on North Korea and Chinese businesses that work with North Korea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a fair point. What would the US need to do with a military strike to set North Korea back far enough in their nuke ambitions to either: 1) make them give up on trying again, or 2) set them back far enough that another attack isn't needed for a long time? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This logic has been in play with North Korea for a long time. Seriously, what can we do now, in terms of military action, that won't make the situation worse?

Let's say the US does attack North Korea in the next few days because they think another nuke test is about to happen. We could damage or destroy that facility, but wouldn't North Korea also retaliate with an attack on South Korea or Japan? Presumably, they could fire a nuke into South Korea. That would be the end of the current North Korean leadership, given the massive military response in reply, but a whole lot of people could be killed in the process.

We could take the risk the North Korea wouldn't retaliate if the US blew up their nuke testing facility, but that does seem to be a huge risk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Government money and public funds pay for polygamy](https://www.culteducation.com/group/1099-polygamist-groups/16852-government-money-and-public-funds-pay-for-polygamy.html)

 Welfare is often how polygamist communities like Hildale in Utah and Colorado City in Arizona substantially support themselves. Polygamists often use food stamps to feed their families. Former polygamist Benjamin Bisline said, "If it wasn't for government subsidies, these people couldn't survive. There are people here with 15 wives on welfare.'' Bisline still lives in a polygamist town.

 Colorado City and Hildale were on a list of the top ten towns with a population over 2,000 in the Intermountain West for reliance upon Medicaid (health care for the poor) in 1998. And in that same year the same towns draw from the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program (food for low-income mothers) could only be equaled by Western Indian reservations and impoverished inner cities. 33% of Hildale and Colorado City residents were using food stamps in 1998. To put this into perspective, respectively Arizona's average was 6.7% and Utah's 4.7% during that same period. </TEXT>

I didn't have such issues around movies and even enjoyed trying to watch the porn channel on the old school cable boxes, trying to spot the occasional genitalia through the static.

I did have all sorts of issues around nudity and my own body. In my later 20s I went to a place with a clothing optional hot spring. Initially, the idea of stripping down in front of a bunch of strangers seemed terrifying, but it was a time in my life when I was trying to challenge my boundaries. I went for it, got nude and had a soak. It was a liberating experience that I still fondly look back on. </TEXT>

If you are running a software company and need people, it's not like there is some huge pool of US citizens sitting on the sidelines, who have all the skills needed for the job. If companies can't find the people in the US, won't they just look to places like India, and open or expand development offices there? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Ask those H1-Bs to write down the name of those excellent institutions they graduated from. 

It seems like the research should be done as part of the interview process.

In my experience, the school a person attends is not a good indicator of how good their work will be. One of the best engineers I worked with had an English Degree. He is now CTO of a very successful company. People who have dropped out of college to start working are also often quite good.

They are very smart academically, but that often doesn't translate into being a good engineer in practice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who works in high tech with a number of H-1B teamates, I don't support what Trump is doing. It's a complex issue. On the bad side, I have seen people with H-1B visas get lower salaries, work long hours, and get treated like they are stuck because their visa is tied to their employment. I don't see how these changes to the visa process would address this issues, other than raising the salary requirements.

I don't see how this will help companies. There is a shortage of tech workers, both US born, and from other countries. Whenever we interview for a new position it takes a long time to find someone. I see no evidence of some large pool of high skilled and unemployed US engineers. In my experience, you have a better chance of getting hired if you are a citizen, it's less paperwork and lawyer work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had similar problems when I was younger and it caused a lot of problems. I would meet someone I was attracted to, but as soon as I thought they wouldn't measure up to my mother's high Catholic standards, I would basically sabotage any chance of the relationship going anywhere.

I agree with what other people are saying: it's your life, make your own choices. I ultimately married an atheist.

But some other pieces of advice that eluded me when I was in my early 20s.

Dating does not mean marrying. It's totally fine and fun, to just go out on dates without thinking, is this going to lead to marriage? Am I going to have to introduce this person to my parents? Go out with people who you find attractive and interesting. You will learn more about yourself too, what you want out of a relationship, what you like sexually, and what type of person you want to be in a relationship with. Don't rush the marriage issue. There's no reason to introduce everyone you date to your parents. If it helps, tell them you are going out with a friend. All of this might sound obvious to most people, but I didn't get it for a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to understand why people who voted for Trump would be upset with a Trump Presidency. Since he was sworn in, it's just been an extension of his campaign. The daily (hourly?) scandals. The ridiculous tweets.He is even attempting to put a lot of his campaign promises into law, or at least executive actions.

The health care replacement was a big failure, he has totally failed to "drain the swamp", and he hasn't gone after Hillary, but otherwise he is pretty much right on the money with his campaign.

<TEXT> The approach I've been working on is to:

* Keep the top IV of each Pokemon.
* When a level 1 IV is better than a level 2 or 3, I evolve it. ex: Pidgey has a higher IV than Pidgeotto, evolve it. In some ideal world, I would have a 100 IV of every Pokemon. 
* Keep best IV of each Shiny variant (so far that's the Pikachu and Raichu Santa and party hat versions). I'm still trying to find a Gold Magikarp.
* I'm starting to keep the best IV of each gender, when there is some visual difference in gender.
* For my good fighters, I keep more than one, and keep powering them up.
* I haven't found an Unown yet, but I plan to keep the best IV of each letter. Hopefully, I'll eventually find the full alphabet.
* In the recent software update I noticed they added gender icons in the Pokedex, so now that's something to obsess over, getting a complete set.

Is there a full list of existing shiny variants and a list of which Pokemon have visual gender differences? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm with you on the Domestic Terrorist label not being used nearly enough. Especially if the person with an itchy trigger finger is white, Christian, and the typical Murcia as Apple pie chacteristics. I thought the Bundy Ya'all Queda folks should have been given the Domestic Terrorist label from the get go, given their obvious political agenda. Same with all the home grown militia folks with their fantasies of over throwing the government.

America just isn't willing to make an honest assessment of all the problems firearms cause. Instead it's easier to blame people at the margins. Illegal immigrants and Muslims are the current favorites. Arguments about immigrants committing less crime, sanctuary cities have no higher crime rate, and the countries on Trump's travel ban attempts producing basically none of the terrorists who have attacked America--those arguments fall on deaf ears.

It would get really uncomfortable for a lot of folks if they looked at the news each day and read about America's latest home grown white Domestic Terrorist and people started debating how to restrict their access to guns. We can't even pass the most basic common sense gun laws.

<TEXT> I've had one for about a month and love it.

* Works great in the car, and not as dangerous as messing with my phone. It doesn't seem to be affected by the "your going too fast" popup, and it often gets Pokestops that I could rarely get on the phone.
* Gain XP faster. Whenever the thing buzzes, I press.
* It sees Pokemon that are a little further away and haven't yet shown up on the phone.
* The different buzzing patterns (Pokestop/New Pokemon/Pokemon you already have) make it easy to play without even looking at it.

What would make it better?

* Rechargeable battery with USB charging support.
* Greater configurability. Currently, you can select if your want to look for Pokestops and/or Pokemon. It seems to weight Pokemon before Pokestops, even when I've got little to no Pokeballs. Would be nice to configure to skip certain Pokemon, or even set an order of priority. It only uses the basic red Pokeballs, and only throws one then gives up. More configurablity to use other ball types and throw more than one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a tough one. I was worried this would happen when I got married, but thankfully the uber Catholic family and relatives kept their objections to themselves.

I would go forward with the wedding as you want it. It's your special day. I wouldn't cut your father out of the wedding or make threats. Instead, I would tell him how much he means to you and how much you want him there. He may not change his mind, but at least you are taking the high road.

As others have said, if you give in to his wishes now, the same problems will likely come up when you have children. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Do you have any advice for standing up to parents about a conversion?

You will need to determine how your parents might react if you want to continue with leaving Catholicism. Since you are living at home, it might be worth while to at least try out the Byzantine Rite Church, if only to say "I tried it, and it's not for me". As for how to get to the Orthodox church in time for the service you want to attend. What are your options? Are you wanting your parents to drive you? That could be asking a lot based on their initial reaction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know lots of church going Catholics who are pro birth control, pro-choice, and pro same sex marriage. Some even send their children to Catholic schools. I think they like the communities they are a part of, and they like some aspects of Catholicism, at least enough to keep going.

Personally, I'm with you, I don't get it. I was definitely a Cafeteria Catholic for a number of years before I finally stopped going to church and finally saw myself as an ex Catholic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome. There are a number of ex Catholics here who have joined other religions, also lots of non-religious/atheist folks. It's tough talking to your parents about these issues. It didn't go well when I had that conversation. It doesn't go well for a lot of people. It can take time for your parents to see you as an independent adult who is making their own decisions, even decisions that they disagree with.

I liked how you started out with them saying you could choose any religion when you turned 18. As for why they reacted differently when you actually decided to make that choice, it's the difference between thinking you could let your child choose their own religion, and actually having to accept them doing so. Give them time, they may come around.

As for what to do, most people will start by asking: how dependent are you on your parents? Are you living at home? Are they paying for your education? If so, and if those are at risk by choosing a different religion, it might be best to wait until you are living on your own and not financially dependent on your parents.

You mention not driving or having access to a bus route to your new church. I think it would be asking a lot to have your parents take you, given their reaction to the news. Do you have a friend who attends the church? Can they give you a lift?

<TEXT> I wonder how far down this rabbit hole goes. Are we to assume that the mass graves contains just children that were either stillborn or died very young? Is there a still darker side? Were these mothers and children neglected to the point where there were unnecessary deaths?

A few years ago I watched the film [Sex in a Cold Climate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtxOePGgXPs) that tells the story of several women who ended up in these places, had children while unmarried, and were treated by the nuns in ways that might make ISIS blush.

Fuck, at this point, I would believe almost anything.

 In recent years, more of my friends have taken something distracting out of their life to add a practice that is more life-giving. For instance, people leaving social media for Lent and replacing time spent online with reading spiritual books, journal writing and prayer. Others give up television for hiking or eating out at restaurants for gardening.  
 Replacing a time-consuming distraction with an often-ignored practice is not necessarily about denial. Instead, this kind of choice balances us, putting us back in touch with slower, more intentional ways of life. We only have so much time in a 24-hour day. Lent offers the opportunity of considering how and on what we spend that precious resource. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's also helpful to ask the opposite question: "what if one of America's top companies replaced their CEO with someone with no business experience?"

As an example, let's use Apple. When Steve Jobs stepped down. The put Tim Cook in as CEO. Tim had been at Apple for many years. He had worked closely with Steve. He filled in for Steve when he was on sick leave. He had all sorts of knowledge about Apple's products and business.

Let's compare that with bringing in someone with a lot of political experience as CEO. We can use Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama as examples. Both have spent most/all of their adult life in politics and by most measures, have been very successful.

My guess is, if one of them were appointed CEO of Apple, or some comparable company, investors wouldn't be too happy. Their political experience would certainly be a plus when dealing with the government, but their general lack of industry experience is bound to cause problems. A skilled leader could delegate, but in the end, you still need someone at the top to make decisions.

Following your Jeff Bezos example, let's say Steve Jobs, when he was still alive and healthy, decided to run for President. Apple was certainly a success in his later years. I liked the guy, but I wouldn't have much reason to support him as a candidate for President, especially if his campaign was a Trump styled ego trip and light on any real policy details.

Donald Trump's main popularity seemed to be due to his "you're fired!" attitude on The Apprentice and his not at all subtle racist, xenophobic approach where he wouldn't apologize for anything stupid he said and would generally double down on the insanity. There have been plenty of candidates who are racist and xenophobic, but they generally don't get far at the national level. Maybe his "fuck it, I'll be a sexist asshole and get away with it" attitude also appealed to some people. Maybe it was some weird sense of looking up to him.

I still struggle to understand how Donald Trump pulled it off. Maybe he was just the right person and the right time who could tap into the deep reserves of anger that many Americas have toward their government. Combine that with most people seeing his campaign as a joke and waiting far too long to dig up dirt on him.

<TEXT>  I think there can be a healthy, moderate practice of this idea of enduring in the midst of suffering (such as the simple believe that hard work pays off in the end) but Catholicism takes it to the excess, to the point of getting its believers drunk on suffering.

I like the idea of the [Serenity Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer). As I get older, I find that in most situations there is a way experience less suffering. Often it's just talking with someone else about a situation, can help me feel better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I inherited and adopted some of this masochism as a Catholic. When situations became a struggle I generally wouldn't ask for help. I would be fuckin' miserable and just try to plow through it. I thought all the pain was just part of the process, and I generally didn't question it. I would even look down my nose on people taking an easier approach.

Now, I hate the saying "that which doesn't kill you makes your stronger". Back in the day, I did that. Maybe I learned a few things along the way with this stubborn attitude, but it wasn't worth all the misery. I'm glad I can more easily notice the warning signs when I see myself starting to do this now, and generally can ask for help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Therapy was the key for me. I found a local therapist and spent a long while on the couch. My therapist followed the CBT "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy" approach. Slowly I started to see how I kept getting into the same situations and started to understand the thought patterns behind it. There was plenty of it tied into my Catholic upbringing, guilt, shame, anger. It took some time to unravel all of it, but I can honestly say therapy was the best thing I've ever done for myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I think your logic is sound, I really hope they don't wait until the 1 year anniversary before we see any new Pokemon. From my casual sampling of players on local Pokegon Go Facebook groups, most people have all or almost all of the currently available Gen 1 and Gen 2 babies. I just need to walk my Togepi 45 more km to gen enough candy to evolve it. I'm not all gold level on all the achievements, so that's another project to work on, but the excitement is starting to slow down, for me. Why risk having all the daily players drift off before they drop Gen 2?

Edit: an intermediary option could be to remove the region restrictions so we can catch three more Gen 1 mons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I missed the "my girls" comment on my first read through the article. I kept expecting his advocating for celibacy as wanting his children to become Priests. Maybe Nuns in this case, but he doesn't mention wanting his children to join a religious order.

I also wondered if by celibacy he meant, just have sex a few times once you get married, to have children, but he clearly states he doesn't want grandchildren.

With all the parental celebacy pressure I expect his daughters to be regular contributors to /r/excatholic once they get old enough to realize their father is nuts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, the situation sounds even worse than I thought.

Trump will be able to take the "blame the previous Administration" route for a little while. Soon enough he will run into problems that won't be so easily explained away, and can't be solved with a 3am Tweet. That's when this shit show will get really interesting.

What should also be interesting is to see how members of Congress and foreign leaders try to use Trump's personality weaknesses against Trump. It shouldn't be too hard to back Trump into a corner.

Edit: a few more thoughts. Reading this article and can see some of the aspects voters liked in Trump. As a reality TV star he could fire people each week and treat people like shit. That is entertaining for people. As a business man who would cheat his investors, bankrupt businesses, while getting rich himself, I guess some people could admire that. Similar with his sexiest pig personality.

The thing all these pieces of Trump's past have in common is: they don't impact the lives of most Americans, other than providing a perverse form of entertainment. All of that changes at noon on Friday. He is going to find the people he previously entertained getting really pissed at him as soon as they start blaming the Trump administration for whatever problems they have in their lives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why would anyone expect something different? American politics is so polarized. Roughly 50% of America will dislike President Trump. Since President Elect Trump is going out of his way to be an extra special asshole, his approval numbers are even lower.

All of this will hurt his businesses. Maybe he can leverage his Presidency to help with his current business debt, but if he keeps up his jerky behavior his businesses will still lose customers.

Prior to the election, I already thought Trump was an asshole, but didn't care that much. Now, I will go out of my way to not spend money on any Trump owned business. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We could make the distinction between responsible and irresponsible behavior, when pregnant. Irresponsible behavior would cover chemical endangerment. A person who is honest and says they are unable to care for their child and seeks the help from the state, that is responsible behavior.

I am bothered by the punishment aspect of the "pro life" community. The general "if you didn't want to get pregnant then you shouldn't have sex" argument, or "only have sex and get pregnant if you are married and can take care of a baby". With all the health benefits of human sexuality beyond reproduction, it's ridiculous to put such tight restrictions and punishment around sex. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We could immediately grant full rights and person hood status to all one second old fertilized eggs and they STILL would not have the right to use another person's body without that person's consent.

Wow, now that is a fascinating new way (for me) to look at protecting a woman's rights.

Parent's can surrender rights to their children, to the state. That happens for a variety of reasons, often because they can't take care of the child. Maybe fill out the paperwork to surrender your parental rights to this one second old person, and then force the state to either (pay for your medical care or provide an abortion). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can sympathize with your story. I too struggled with having sexual relationships even after becoming "ex Catholic". After a while, I realized I was mostly going out of my way to avoid relationships, that I was lonely, and that I really didn't know how to fix my situation. It was a dark time. I felt really stuck.

Therapy was the key for me. I found a local therapist and spent a long while on the couch. My therapist followed the CBT "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy" approach. Slowly I started to see how I kept getting into the same situations and started to understand the thought patterns behind it. There was plenty of it tied into my Catholic upbringing, guilt, shame, anger. It took some time to unravel all of it, but I can honestly say therapy was the best thing I've ever done for myself.

<TEXT>  If you are White and you pride yourself in your heritage, culture, religion, or ancestry suddenly you're a racist.

That's not entirely true. It depends on how people celebrate those ideas.

People who are of Irish descent celebrate St. Patricks Day and aren't generally thought of a racist. Similar for Italian Americas, and probably people of any European descent who want to celebrate their particular background or culture. There are plenty of religious/cultural celebrations throughout the year. There are days in memory of various saints, or just food and culture festivals. None of these are generally considered racist.

I'm a white guy, but have also never felt comfortable with the idea of "white pride". I don't really know what that means, in the general sense of being white. I have Irish ancestors and do some basic St. Patricks Day recognition. In America, we have national holidays, the 4th of July and Thanksgiving being two popular ones. They aren't specifically white, but pride in our ancestors is widely celebrated, and most of the key historical figures those holidays are based on, were white.

What are ways people could celebrate pride in being white, without the general racist overtones? I genuinely struggle with how to answer this question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Republicans have found themselves in a difficult spot, they didn't really expect to be in, with Trump winning and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed, they have been trying to repeal it. Once Republicans took over the House, but President Obama was still President, House Republicans staged dozens of votes, passing a repeal of the Affordable Care Act that they knew had a 0% chance of getting signed by President Obama. It was just good old-fashioned political theater, and throwing a bone to their conservative base.

Now that Republicans can actually repeal and replace, or just repeal and walk away, they have found themselves in the unenviable position of having to try to fix and system that really can't be fixed, at least by anything remotely acceptable to Republicans.

They made a mistake calling it "Obamacare", making it immediately disliked by conservatives. Whatever gets created next will be called "Trumpcare" or something silly like that, and Republicans will get the blame every time someone can't afford healthcare under that new system. [Reviews of existing Republican health care plans](http://www.vox.com/2016/11/17/13626438/obamacare-replacement-plans-comparison) show that they will cause more people to lose insurance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The part I'm confused by is: do Republicans really want to repeal Obamacare, replace it with Trump/Ryan Care, or whatever moniker it gets, and then Republicans get all the grief when things go wrong? Much like privitizing Social Security, or the general dislike of Social Security by conservatives. That's been an issue for them since FDR. It gets their base excited. Once they privitize or overhaul something, it's the old "you break it, you bought it".

<TEXT>  Natural Law

I have read some about Natural Law and it being the basis for the Church's views on same-sex relationships, birth control, and more. With same-sex couples and children, there are other methods: adoption, and in the case of women, one of them being the biological mother. Is it really in the best interest of humanity and our fragile planet that everyone who wants to be in a sexual relationship, get married to someone of the opposite sex and try to have lots of children? It's just cruel to tell people who feel otherwise, "no sex for you" when there are all sorts of benefits to human sexuality beyond keeping our species going.

 Kalam Cosmological Argument

I don't know where all the matter and energy in the Universe came from, but I do think it is a fascinating question. The idea that all of it had to come from somewhere and someone had to light the proverbial match to start the Big Bang, I just am not satisfied with "God did that". That leads to "where did God come from". If God is immortal, then why isn't all the matter and energy immortal?

I don't have a good answer for all this. I have spent a long time thinking about it, reading about it, and talking about it with others. I love books on Cosmology and trying to wrap my brain around topics like String Theory, Supersymmetry, and the Multiverse. It is pretty amazing that we little humans can ponder such big questions and come up with so many possible answers.

I am glad all the matter and energy are here. I try to feel a general sense of gratitude, though not directed towards any particular being. It's more of a gratitude that all these billions of years of time has led to people like you and me being here, pondering such questions.

<TEXT> Early on as an ex-Catholic, I did want to be excommunicated but had no idea how. I saw it as a clean break. I never did figure out how. That process does seem to be selective on the Church's part. They seem to reserve excommunication for public figures, perhaps to make an example. The hassle to get excommunicated was just going to require me giving more time to a church I had already left. I found therapy to be far more helpful in resolving issues I still had.

I also gave up on the idea when I thought about some Church official sending a letter to the parish I grew up in, asking them to take me off the books, and how upset my mother would be. I had my fill of that grief when I told her I was no longer going to Mass.

<TEXT>  We don't teach to be jerks to LGBTQ people

"Jerks" was a poor choice of word on my part. It does bother me that the Church has taken a stand against same-sex marriage, and generally same-sex relationships. I have lots of LGBTQ friends and know 5 married couples. I know the Church has its theological reasons. I just think they are coming down on the wrong side of history.

 abortion is a huge fight for us as we value the life of everyone

I don't want to make this a thread about abortion since the Church's views on abortion had nothing to do with my decision to leave the Church.

 I'm curious why you think science and the faith are incompatible. Many theologians and scientists of the Catholic faith are highly regarded in fields like astronomy, biology, and evolution.

I don't think science and faith are inherently incompatible. For example, I appreciate the Catholic Church's acceptance of [evolution and the big bang](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/10/28/pope-francis-evolution-big-bang/18053509/). I am grateful I didn't learn Creationism in CCD class and I could enjoy science classes in high school and college without wondering about 'young Earth' issues. It wasn't until my mid-20s that I met people who took Creationism seriously, and they weren't Catholic.

My story, of leaving the Church, began later than this article describes. I was in my 20s when I left. I could point to a moment or two of doubt in my early teens but still went to Mass and thought of myself as a Catholic until my early 20s. It was a gradual process over several years. I did have a crisis of faith around science and religion. The Universe being 13.8 billions years old, human evolution going back 2 millions years, modern humans 100,000 years, and the Bible stories all taking place in the past few thousand years. Looking back, I did have a literal interpretation of the Biblical stories and events. It bothered me how human-centric everything was. At the time these stories were written down, the understanding of our place in the Universe was quite different.

I came to understand that the Universe had been humming along and doing its thing for those many billions of years. At first, I was a little sad once I stopped believing we were Gods chosen species. It was even a little scary to see the Universe as a place not controlled by a divine being who could intervene on our behalf.

Over time I came to appreciate all of it in a different way. I love being a small piece of such a grand story going back billions of years. All the little random moments of evolution and all my ancestors going back to the earliest forms of life, each making another generation. I prefer the Universe where there is not a prime mover or clock maker. Where I can look up in the night sky, seeing the stars and light from stars billions of miles away, and knowing that I am connected to it all. That's the stuff that fills me with awe and wonder.

In terms of values and behaving kindly to other people, I think I am now in the secular humanist camp. I prefer living in a world where we try to treat each other with kindness and respect. Not because someone else is telling us to, or out of fear of punishment after death, but just because it makes this a better world to live in.

<TEXT> In the photographer case, would the KKK have any legal grounds to sue the photographer for refusing service, even if the photographer said, "I won't work with you because I think the KKK is a bunch of racist assholes." I would expect that court case wouldn't go very far.

Another example: let's say a heterosexual couple wants to get married in their local Catholic Church. The couple isn't Catholic and has no interest in becoming Catholic. Let's say they like the pretty stained glass and think it would be a nice place for a wedding. I think it's reasonable for a Priest to say no. No to performing the service, and no to using the Church, on religious grounds.

The reason I mention Civil Rights issues about (whites only signs, etc), is those are cases where the Court ruled against the business owners, on grounds of what has become known as "protected status". On the federal level, protected status does not include sexual orientation, though it is included in a number of states. The Supreme Court should weigh on if sexual orientation is protected status in all 50 states. If this law passes and is challenged, it could be the right opportunity for the court to weigh in. </TEXT>

 FADA would prohibit the federal government from taking "discriminatory action" against any business or person that discriminates against LGBTQ people. The act distinctly aims to protect the right of all entities to refuse service to LGBTQ people based on two sets of beliefs: "(1) marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or (2) sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage."

It's not just having the right to say you don't like same sex couples, it protects the actions they take. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The author is articulate, but doesn't offer any reasons why voting for Trump would help address his problems and that of his fellow coal miners.

 Corporate greed, mechanization and the rise of fracking have forced people in Dickenson County into lower-paying, less stable work.

This is a good summary. The Democrats really dropped the ball this election cycle. Democrats are the ones who fight against fracking. Democrats are the ones who fight for raising the minimum wage. Democrats are the ones who see more value in Unions.

Why would anyone think a rich guy like Trump and all his rich friends he is bringing into his administration would also fight for the little guy?

<TEXT> That is a surprisingly frank assessment of the situation. I took a similar path out the door, the struggle between faith and science. Science won. I didn't have anyone who was a devote Catholic who I also felt comfortable talking about my doubts with. Those conversations always felt like "it's just a little phase. There, there. You will come back to the Church."
If I could give the Church, and the writer of this article, some advice, it would be to focus less on faith and more on good works. Put aside the miracles and the super natural. Is it any surprise that kids these days are a skeptical of stories of Jesus walking on water, or feeding the masses.
For the good works part, just look at all the young people Bernie Sanders got excited with his progressive platform. A lot of that is in line with Catholic teachings, it's just that pesky abortion stuff that gets in the way, or being a jerk towards LGBTQ people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to lookup [Antinomianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinomianism). 

 The distinction between antinomian and other Christian views on moral law is that antinomians believe that obedience to the law is motivated by an internal principle flowing from belief rather than from any external compulsion.

That almost sounds like Unitarian Universalism or even Secular Humanism.

If it's true that they didn't influence the election enough to be responsible for Trump's election, then President Obama's reaction is appropriate. A lot of people are thinking otherwise, that Russia's influence was key to Trump's victory.  Maybe those folks are venturing into conspiracy theory territory. I really don't know.

<TEXT> Sure, but I'm wondering, why draw the line here, with bullets and background checks? Don't other gun laws (background checks, waiting periods, magazine capacity) also inconvience law abiding citizens? You could also argue that laws restricting access to automatic weapons are unfair, since some criminals find a way to get their hands on them.

There is evidence that gun laws work:

* [More Guns, More Crime](http://www.nber.org/papers/w7967)
* [The Relationship Between Gun Ownership and Firearm Homicide Rates in the United States, 19812010](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301409?journalCode=ajph ) - "Gun ownership was a significant predictor of firearm homicide rates (incidence rate ratio=1.009; 95% confidence interval=1.004, 1.014). This model indicated that for each percentage point increase in gun ownership, the firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9%."
* [More guns, more crime: New research debunks a central thesis of the gun rights movement](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/14/more-guns-more-crime-new-research-debunks-a-central-thesis-of-the-gun-rights-movement/)
* [The Accessibility of Firearms and Risk for Suicide and Homicide Victimization Among Household Members: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis]
(http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1814426) - "Conclusion: Access to firearms is associated with risk for completed suicide and being the victim of homicide."
* [Long List of Research](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/wiki/academic_sources)
* [New Study Is Latest to Find That Higher Rates of Gun Ownership Lead to Higher Rates of Violent Crime](http://www.thetrace.org/2015/06/new-study-is-latest-to-find-that-higher-rates-of-gun-ownership-lead-to-higher-rates-of-violent-crime/) - Data shows that states with the top rates of gun possession have nearly three times the rate of gun murders compared to states with the fewest guns.
* [Guns Don't Deter Crime, Study Finds](http://www.livescience.com/51446-guns-do-not-deter-crime.html)
* [States With Tighter Gun Control Laws Have Fewer Gun Deaths](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/10/02/gun_control_by_state_tougher_laws_mean_fewer_deaths.html)

<TEXT> I have storage for 350. I keep the high IV mons that are good fighters, and then one of each in the most evolved state.

For the ones that can evolve into gen 2, I keep a few and have enough candy for all but the Porygon.

For the ones with gen 2 babies, I had been holding onto as many as I could find, thinking they would randomly be assigned genders and then breed the little ones. Now that it's random based on eggs, I'm going to trim those groups down.

What I used to do with th common ones lik Pidgey is, I would transfer them as soon as I found them, until I had enough to evolve one, then evolve right away for XP. Recently I switched to holding on to enough to evolve with the candy I have. I was waiting to evolve all the gen 1 mons that have a gen 2 version. I want to us a Lucky Egg and then evolve everything for max XP. I'm still holding out for that, of if they have a Christmas event with double XP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you found a church that's been good for you and helped you through tough times, that's great. I've had plenty of stuff to say in criticism of the Church, but it's not like they are wrong 100% of the time.

As far as being pro-choice or pro-same sex marriage while also being Catholic, I don't think you are in as small of a minority as it might appear. I don't think I've ever met a Catholic, even the hard core ones, who could honestly say the agreed with the Church 100% and tried to live up to it. For people who stay in the Church, they find their ways of making peace with their differences. The unlucky ones get stuck with a lot of guilt. </TEXT>

 On Dec. 4, Edgar M. Welch, a 28-year-old from North Carolina, arrived at Comet with a military-style rifle and a handgun. The police said he fired the rifle inside the pizzeria, hurting no one, and surrendered after finding no evidence to support claims of child slaves being held there.

 The shooting did not put the theory to rest. Purveyors of the theory and fake news pointed to the mainstream media as conspirators of a coverup to protect what they said was a crime ring.

<TEXT> I would add Daryl to the list of people plotting to kill Negan. His plan is less clear, more of a waiting for the right opportunity plan.

I'm also wondering what Spencer is planning. If he is to kill someone with the bow he found, his likely target is Rick. Would he try to kill Negan if the opportunity presented itself?

Michonne's plan of going to see Negan with just a sword and a pistol seems rather crazy. It's not likely she could just walk up to him and chop his head off.

Carl is another person looking for another opportunity. Especially now that Negan is playing with Little Ass Kicker.

If Rick comes home to find Negan holding his child, that could push him over the edge too.

All this plot setting up looks to mean at least one of these stories will lead to an attempt on Negan's life next week. I expect Negan to survive and then kill someone in revenge.

<TEXT>  I never heard anything about a registry for Muslim Americans.

[Another source](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/20/donald-trump-says-hed-absolutely-require-muslims-to-register/). It's all in how you parse Trump's statements. Personally, I don't think he would try to get US citizens to register.

I still think the whole registry idea is just PR talk. We already know who gets visas to enter the US. We know what countries they are coming from. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They need to relax the driving restriction on Pokestops. I commute by car and counted on grabbing some pokeballs on my commute. Sure, it's not the smartest idea, but I was careful. There is plenty of slow stop and go traffic. Now pokestops work only if I have been sitting still for a few seconds.

Lately, I've been passing on most Pokemon I see, in an effort to stock up on pokeballs for when gen 2 drops.

To make matters worse, the one pokestop near by office has been unreliable due to the GPS not working well indoors. That's probably nothing to due with Pokemon, but it's been a real pain. </TEXT>

Conservatives and the NRA have been effective at labeling Democrats that way.

<TEXT> Greatest Hope: Trump turns out to be a moderate President who doesn't go through with most of his far right campaign proposals. Mostly I hope that the economy continues to do well. If Trump gets some credit for that, that's fine. If he can actually help some of the 'white working class' voters that he appealed to, that's great too.

Greatest Fear: That Trump and the Republican Congress actually implement some of Trump's far right ideas. If there were another 9/11 size terrorist attack, how far would Trump and Congress go? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Twitter seems like a hard way to communicate any meaningful information. YouTube videos are a good idea, and longer form text social media.

Even if Trump isn't standing at a podium in front of the White House Press Corp, the press will still be an important part of all this. We still need experts to review what Trump is saying, point out where his ideas are not economically feasible, or even potentially violating the law.

This could just end up being an odd way to communicate with the press. Where Trump says something directly, the press write about all the ways it won't work, and the Trump tweets at the press in response. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One issue with nationalism, even the version that includes the diverse background of everyone in the US, is what happens in the world when the US pulls back and takes an inward focus? We have a great deal of influence all around the globe. Some of that is due to our economic strength and some is due to our military strength. There is no reason that global reach needs to continue, but it would be foolish to turn inward without looking at the very real problems that would cause elsewhere in the world. Who would try to solve thos of problems? What old scores would be settled if we weren't there to stop them? Before you say, "who cares, that's not our problem" first look at what happened in the Balkins after the fall of Communism, or the Middle East after the Arab Spring, or even them Middle East since the first Gulf War. These situations have a tendency to become our problems whether we like it or not. </TEXT>

For all this hatred of "Washington Insiders" the idea that he can put together an entire administration made up of people who never worked in Washington and have no idea how Washington works, that's just plain bat shit crazy. There need to be some grown-ups at the table. I'm not a fan of Reince Priebus, but at least he's a grown up and looks to be Trump's Chief of Staff. That's a smart move. If he gets enough of these folks, and is *willing to listen to them* (that's a big if), then they can help get him through the learning curve without making too big of a mess along the way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been looking for the Conservative *legal* argument against same sex marriage. Especially since it is now legal. I'm not seeing a legal argument that could be used to take same sex marriage case all the way to the Supreme Court and over turn it. The cake baker argument doesn't seem to be enough to overturn all same sex marriages. At best, the court could allow someone to refuse service to a same sex marriage couple, but "separate but equal" doesn't tend to work with the court. Have any of the legal folks who want to overturn the Court's decision share what the strategy would be? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the case of a baker, wouldn't they only have standing to bring a case to say it's okay to not bake a cake for a same-sex wedding?

A same-sex couple suing for the right to marry, to have equal protection as heterosexual couples, I see how that legal argument works, and why they won.

I'm not seeing how the anti-same-sex marriage argument works. Stuff like "it's against my religion" wouldn't get them very far. If you don't think you should marry someone of the same sex, don't. Suing because you are personally offended that two dudes got married, that's argument is going to get thrown out. That's been the problem with the anti-same-sex legal issues, they never came up with a legit legal argument.

<TEXT> That's just it, the standard Catholic stance is either:

* Have sex to create babies, if you are married
* or, don't have sex.
* no birth control.

It's untenable. People may try to follow the rules, but almost everyone eventually gives up and just tries to enjoy the many joys of human sexuality.

I sure hope this Priest gets in trouble with his superiors and they don't pat him on the back and encourage this type of behavior. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, Trump could cause Hillary a lot of problems. If he keeps at it on Twitter and especially if he starts a new network, he can keep on spinning conspiracy theories, calling for more investigations, impeachment, etc. There may not be much in the way of facts to back up his assertions, but that's never stopped Trump before and his antics during the campaign have hurt Hillary's reputation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have [this set of joysticks and buttons](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WAZK5K8/), with a Pi 3 and Retropie. I have been having trouble getting the joystick to work in games.

The buttons are wired up as described [here](https://github.com/libretro/retroarch-joypad-autoconfig/blob/master/udev/DragonRise_Inc.___Generic___USB__Joystick__.cfg). I copied the full config file onto my Pi. The joystick up/down/left/right works fine when navigating around the RetroPie menus. When I start a game, Ms. PacMan for example, the joystick doesn't work right. I can go left right, but not up down. Similar behavior with the Colecovision emulator.

A few questions:

* Is there additional configuration needed for each emulator to map the joysticks and buttons?
* How do I configured one set of joystick/buttons for player 1 and the other for player 2?
* How to configure games like Robotron where both joysticks are used? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Abortion would be legal.

Abortion and guns are where a new party platform will get tricky. I suspect many conservative Catholics and other conservative religious folks wouldn't be comfortable voting for a pro choice candidate.

 Gun rights? I would think their best bet would be full gun rights, no restrictions.

Being pro choice and even more pro 2nd Amendment than current laws, that could also be a difficult platform to bring people together on.

There have been polls that show most Americans, even gun owners and NRA members support the modest gun regulations that Democrats are pushing for (no fly/no buy, universal background checks, magazine capacity).

 The real question is how to keep the alt-right out.

This one seems a little easier. Have a candidate who takes a strong stance against racism and zenophobia. Make it clear that anyone is welcome, no matter their religious or ethnic background. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what you mean by fiscally liberal. There is an argument to be made that this is what the mainstream GOP is. They play it pretty loose on fiscal policy. Big task cuts, big borrowing, big debt increases. They talk about curbing entitlements by rarely do much about it.

I suppose you are asking a more serious question, about a party or candidate who truly embraces "fiscally liberal but socially conservative". As someone who grew up Catholic, I think you are on to something here. Most socially conservative Catholics I know vote Republican. This is primarily due to the abortion issue. Most of these same people are eager and active in helping the poor. I do find them to be a little uncomfortable with the idea of paying more in taxes to have that money go to social programs. They seem more comfortable with the Catholic Church and its various charities playing that role. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How did the Feds screw this up so badly? Is anyone guilty of anything? They were [charged with a number of crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge#Trials)

 A total of 27 people involved in the occupation were charged under federal law; of those, 26 have been indicted for a single federal felony count of conspiracy to impede officers of the U.S. from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation, or threats. A number of those under indictment on the conspiracy charge are also charged with a variety of other counts, some of which incur sentences up to life imprisonment, including possession of firearms and dangerous weapons in federal facilities, use and carry of firearms in relation to a crime of violence, depredation of government property (relating to damaging the site "by means of excavation and the use of heavy equipment"), and theft of government property. In addition, several of those under indictment in Oregon have also been indicted separately for their roles in the 2014 Bundy standoff in Nevada.

Hopefully, the government lawyers for the trial in Nevada can learn from the mistakes in Oregon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some colorful details from [Oregon Public Broadcasting](http://www.opb.org/news/series/burns-oregon-standoff-bundy-militia-news-updates/ammon-bundy-verdict-oregon-standoff-malheur-court/)

 After the verdict was read, Ammon Bundys attorney Marcus Mumford was tackled to the ground by five U.S. Marshals. He insisted his client was free to go. Ammon Bundy faces a US Marshall hold and is supposed to be transferred to Nevada where he faces charges for the Bunkerville standoff.

 Theres a hold for Ammon Bundy and Ryan Bundy out of the district of Nevada, said Matt Schindler attorney for Kenneth Medenbach.

 Theres nothing Judge Brown can do about that. So acquitting him here, all it does is effectively release him to that hold, to be transported to Nevada. And the court that has anything authority to deal with that, is the court in Nevada. Marcus let the emotion of the moment, I think, overtake his better judgement.

 During the incident, Judge Brown ordered everyone out of the courthouse. Mumford was later detained.  </TEXT>

I will keep at it, stocking up on candy to evolve the next round of pokemon, whenever they become available. Also, powering up my best fighters to max, and upgrading a few to better IV versions. </TEXT>

Sometimes there's a little icon in the lower left to left me add one of my Pokemon without needing to battle my fellow teammates, other times the icon is not there? It's a good way to help strengthen a gym and get me some training credit. Why is the icon only available sometimes? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump often talks about "ripping up" some existing trade deals and renegotiating better deals. How much power would he have as President to implement these ideas? We also hear a lot about how Congress has yet to ratify the TPP and [is unlikely to do so](http://fortune.com/2016/05/05/trans-pacific-partnership-ratification/). At least this year.

If Congress never ratifies the TPP, will it have any effect on US trade? Would Congress also need to approve any trade deals that Trump would try to renegotiate?

Reading the [Treaty Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Clause)  in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution

  The Treaty Clause, which empowers the President of the United States to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements, which must be confirmed by the Senate, between the United States and other countries, which become treaties between the United States and other countries after the advice and consent of a supermajority of the United States Senate.

Are trade deals covered by this? </TEXT>
