<TEXT> Same here. I live in a small-ish town and pretty much everywhere I drive is 5-10 minutes away, so taking the time to plug in my phone/mp3 player, find a song I want to listen to, etc...I was at my destination by then.  So I found sports radio easier as something to listen to while driving.  Then I got a better job that involves a lot more driving and the habit stuck.

I would actually be interested in sports radio if there was a lot more X's/O's breakdown type of stuff, things that make me more knowledgeable about sports.  But 99% of it now is just a bunch of stupid "what if" crap like "If Chris Paul was on the Warriors and Durant was on the Clippers, would the Clippers be in the finals?"  Like, sure, debate that for half an hour, but it's not reality and it's not gonna happen.  So what's the friggin point? 

So yeah, I've come to love DLS because they make fun of all of that idiotic pontificating that will never have a real answer because the nature of the questions means no real answer is possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Longtime alcoholic, depression since puberty basically. I'd like to try to offer some tips for this.

First - one of the harder parts is dealing with the idea that improving yourself isn't an accomplishment but an ongoing process.  This can be very overwhelming. (If I start to exercise to improve my body/health/looks/whatever, then, jesus, does that mean when I'm 60 I'm still going to be running 5 miles a day and doing tons of situps? Noooooooooooo......)

I think of all the work between here and 60/70/80+ years old, and it seems so overwhelming. That's a *lot* of work, and that's just exercise, not anything else!  So...

Second - Thinking small.  Think about the old trick-question; would you rather have $1million now, or, 1 penny now, but each day for a month your money doubles? (By the end of the month, you end up with more than $1mil.)  Improving yourself isn't winning a lottery, it's adding pennies. 

Third - Improving small. This month, start with just making your bed after you wake up.  You don't have to do a professional hotel-maid job of it; re-stretch your fitted sheet so it's on the mattress nicely, lay your non-fitted sheet on top of that, lay your comforter/blanket on top of that.  Smooth it out.  It should only take 45-90 seconds. Are you worried that spending those 45-90 seconds means you'll "miss" commenting on a reddit post? Once you start doing this, you'll see it's really a pretty damn quick/easy thing to do, and it isn't something that's going to interfere with any other aspect of your life. You have that much time to spare, it's okay to do it.

So just do that for a month.  Don't worry about other improvements. That's all.  Make your bed in the morning. 

When you're ready, start to keep your room clean in general. When you get home from work and change out of work clothes and into your comfy clothes; fold/hang the clothes you're going to use again before washing them, put the clothes you're going to wash straight into the hamper.  This is also something where, once you start doing it for awhile, you realize how quick and easy it really is, and doing it won't interfere with your reddit-browsing. 

Two months have passed, and every time you walk into your bedroom, your bed is made and your clothes are nicely put away.  This starts to feel really good.  And you realize what a ridiculously small amount of time you've spent doing it. You've still been browsing reddit this whole time, you've still been playing plenty of games of Rocket League or dota or whatever, you've still been doing all the things you normally do, you just also have a clean bedroom at the same time.

After that, figure out the next thing you want to improve that's most important to you.  Don't join a gym, enroll in Intro to Japanese, start learning to program Java, and try to cook homemade dinners all at the same time.

Figure out something you do too much of (play video games, drink booze, masturbate, whatever) - don't get rid of that thing entirely.  Just take a portion of the time on that, and put it towards something else, even if it's just one day a week.  

Maybe you love playing DotA - in the time it takes to queue and play one (good-ish) game, you can walk 2 miles, cook a small meal, or finish a section in Rosetta Stone. You don't have to stop playing DotA. If you play three dozen games per week, just "sacrifice" one of those games per week. 

The small things add up. And if you can get into it, and keep it up, you realize the time "lost" on them is pretty minimal, and it starts to make your "non-improvement" things feel a lot better.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> heh I made an almost identical post like this about 5 years ago when I first moved back. 

At pine nursery park in the NE I sometimes see people playing, but, the once or twice I've seen it happening, it included a lot of children, and I think once baseball starts talking over the fields it might come to an end. (This was very early Sunday when I did see it.)

Many many years ago the fields between Cascade middle School and broken top had regular pickup nights, no idea if that's still a thing.

Edit: oh also sometimes when I played disc golf at cocc before that went away I would see what looked like pickup games on the weekends, mid afternoon ish. But those might have been practices or classes.

Was considering joining there PandR summer league but I'm not sure how serious that is and I'm not in the best shape to play "seriously." 

If you find something tho, if love to know. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is literally no downside to leaving your bed unmade 

Not gonna browse your history, but I wouldn't be suprised if yourself and a lot of the people who upvote you deal with some amount of depression.

Wanna know something that kinda helps in some way with depression?  Doing something nice for yourself, like improving your surroundings, and living in less of a shithole.  

It takes like 90 seconds to make a bed. "Oh no, but I had so many comments on reddit I could have posted during that time! I'll never get those shitposts back!"  

Please.  You aren't painting your walls, you aren't doing an oil change.  You're putting your sheets back, and laying a comforter on top of the sheets.  

It feels good to "achieve" something nice, even if it's small. If you aren't taking pride in your surroundings, how much pride can you take in yourself?

Quit being a child.  Make your bed.  You'll feel better. </TEXT>

What happened with the imgur mobile site in the past month?

For the longest time it was really slow to render, and there was a ~5 second lag between when the page "loaded" and when I could actually play the gif.

Then a few weeks ago the look/layout changed and suddenly I could play gifs instantly and it was great.

And then in the past week it went back to the old style and everything is slow and laggy again? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Linux mostly-noob; I've seen lots of comments about issues with dual booting with Win10. Is using 2 SSD's with a single OS on each and switching boot order in BIOS a "better" solution? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-07 05:54:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been considering trying to use linux more, currently Win10 on my current rig (see note below).  Pretty much any time a complaint about Win10 reaches the front page of reddit, there's an inevitable chain of comments suggesting switching to Linux, replies about "I still need Windows for gaming," then talk of dual booting, then lots of people with lots of problems dual booting and it's generally (judging by the comments/upvotes) considered a huge PITA. 

I know the solution in my title isn't perfect but...would switching boot order for two SSD's (as opposed to boot order for two partitions on a single SSD) be "easier" overall? 

Hitting F2 on startup and going through BIOS isn't ideal obviously.  But ...eh?

Personal Note: I use Linux (Mint) on my work PC.  It is my really old PC that was replaced when I could afford a better rig, so the hardware is junk, I expect it to die any day, hence installing Linux to play around with it and see what's up. About 90% of my experience has been fine, with that 10% being...very annoying.  

And it seems a lot of the problems with dual boot involve a whoooooole lot of that 10%. So if your answer is, "Just dual boot, once you get it working, it will be a lot easier," the "once you get it working" part seems frightening. I can't even get my scanner working on my single boot Linux box. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an inherent flaw with the upvote downvote system. I have to explain why something is stupid.  Quote a line from the movie, an upvotes galore! But sure. 

Because if the director/producers/writers/audience ask "But why?" to just about every aspect of that film, none of it makes any sense.

First fight.  Gold people can't fight the alien because...each one is engineered for a specific purpose? So they can't fight this alien using typical weaponry (it dies from a fucking sword), because...why?  They're able to chase the Guardians and attack them using typical weaponry. (Note: using typical as in "weird space guns that are typical for the universe.)  But they can't use those same ships to target an alien, only another spaceship?  

All to protect their batteries, which are super important.  But...why? They can't make new batteries? Rocket stole their batteries, they end up exploding at the end, so that race isn't ever getting those batteries back.  I guess that planet is just doomed to extinction now because their super important batteries are lost forever?  

A daring escape through a quantum asteroid field! I'll ignore how stupid "quantum asteroids" are because it's a wacky universe.  They get through the other side and "oh no, the gold people went around!"  So you went through the asteroid field...why? It wasn't a shortcut, the gold people were on the other side in the same amount of time.  

Somehow the jump they take will get them to safety.  But why? The gold people can't follow them through? Yandu's ship later goes through 150 or whatever.  The jump is safety...why?

They crash, Kurt shows up. Somehow knows right where his son is. (Why?)  Rocket suddenly doesn't understand how perspective/vision works. (Why?) Daxx heads to Ego with the others instead of helping Rocket. (Why?) Groot doesn't understand how buttons work, but is able to free Gamora at the worst time. (Why?) The one and only other life form he tolerates is because she helps him sleep. (Why does he need to sleep? He existed since the birth of the universe but only lately he needs sleep? Or was she around since the start of the universe too? Why?)  

Kurt explains stuff; he decided he wanted to explore the universe "to know what it meant to be human," but he didn't meet humans until 34 years prior to when the movie takes place? His whole plan is to essentially destroy the universe so it's just him.  Wait, didn't he start exploring the universe in the first place because it was lonely being just him? So...why? 

Sylvester goddamn Stallone.  Why? Oh, he's there to show that these ruthless scumbag shitheads have a super serious code about no children.  Yandu didn't eat Peter, didn't molest him, raised him up. So...why is the head of this shithead gang mad? They suddenly have some weird honor system? 

These same people start throwing their crewmates out of the airlock just a bit later. Why? They excommunicate a member for kidnapping a kid, they have a super elaborate space burial ceremony for a fallen member.  But they'll toss their fellow crewmembers out of the airlock, people they've probably spent years working alongside, probably even friends with them, yep right out the airlock they go.  Why?

Yandu gets his ship back and promptly blows up 90% of it.  Why?

There's a button on the bomb that blows up everything instantaneously.  Why?

Second in command at the very end is playing with the arrow, even though Yandu specifically states the other fin was a prototype, and literally the scene before you watch it evaporate with the rest of his corpse. 

Do I need to go on much further? Because I can, but that would require giving this movie more thought than the people making it did. 

It just reeked of "people are bored, it's a sequel, we'll make hundreds of millions, who cares if it doesn't make sense."

So when I left, I thought, "I gave them money.  But why?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> The difference between the vilification of cigarettes and the glorification of alcohol is astounding and disgraceful. 

Let's set aside direct deaths (lung cancer for smokers; alcohol poisoning for drinkers). 

Deaths from second hand smoke are greater than deaths from drunk drivers, sure.   After that, the problems to the general well being of the public in general are so much greater from alcohol.

First - in the history of the planet, there hasn't been a single unwanted pregnancy due to smoking too many cigarettes. (I would argue that children who were unwanted pregnancies contribute to many of the problems in the world, and comprise the majority of prison populations, but that's another debate for another thread.)

How many women or children (and, sometimes men) are beaten by an abusive significant other, largely because of the influence of alcohol?

How many suicides or manic depressives are alcoholics/children of alcoholics? 

How many just generally terrible ideas resulting in terrible injuries (/r/holdmybeer) are due to alcohol? 

How many people have just plain drank their lives away, getting whatever work they can wherever they can just so they can afford to keep drinking when they get home, and contributing little to nothing else in society?

But go to any game thread for any sporting event, one of the top comments will be a gilded remark about how drunk that user is. Alcohol sponsors all of those events. People tell themselves they don't have a problem with alcohol, but what's the primary reason they leave the house for entertainment? Alcohol.  

I say this all as an alcoholic (3 months sober) who still smokes (bought patches, trying to get an Rx for Welbutrin). The stigma attached to one far outweighs the actual societal effect of the other, which is cheered and glorified. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not just lawyers. Real estate appraiser here. Buying a house or doing a refi? It's my job to tell the bank roughly what the property is worth for the loan. So many times I want to tell the homeowners to shut the hell up. 

Just yesterday, called to set up an inspection. The guy was confused about why I had to inspect the interior (because that's what the bank asked). He really wanted exterior only. Exterior only happens sometimes sure, and we include a statement about making an assumption that the interior condition is equal to the exterior condition.

The guy then started telling me about how the floors and walls in two rooms were ruined and required thousands to repair. Guessed what, dumbass? Now I can't make the assumption the interior matches the exterior, I'm required to put that in the report now.

Value goes way down, dude probably won't get his loan. Because he couldn't just shut up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like radio with a variety of artists.  The problem being; in radio stations with some level of overlap, the same songs by the same artists appear in each.  

For instance, I have radio1 which is "experimental" electronic music, along the lines of Prefuse73.  I have radio2 which is more dancey electronic music, along the lines of Daft Punk.  

In both of them, the song Odessa by Caribou appears.  Caribou's earlier albums are closer to radio1.  That song in particular is closer to radio2.  

I don't want to thumbs down Odessa - I like his music, I like this song.  It just isn't the most appropriate for radio1.  And even in radio2, it's the only song of his that ever appears.  

This happens across a ton of genres.  I enjoy 1960s Roy Ayers (jazz), I detest 1980s Roy Ayers (synthy soft jazz). If I thumbs down 80s Ayers, does gMusic know I just don't like that decade of his music?  Or is it just going to stop playing all Ayers on my jazz station? (Seems like the latter.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here, make this catfood thing, but with 1/2 the tomato sauce.

In a different pot, softly melt 1/2 a stick of butter.  Once it's liquid (don't let it boil), add, let's say, 1 tsp curry powder, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 1/4 teaspoon just about any other spice.  Start slowly adding/mixing 1/2 cup of flour, one spoonful at a time, wait until all the flour is dissolved into the butter before adding the next spoonful. You'll end up with a consistency of a thick paste.  

Add 4 cups of veggie/chicken stock.  Now throw your catfood into that.  

Now you have a curry, that will look presentable, and you have about 4x the amount of servings out of it by adding a minimal amount of other ingredients (some butter, flour, spices, stock).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm fairly new to saving up, but I've been following some personal tips, and they've been working well for me.  

1) Check clearance at your grocery store.  It's "embarrassing" if you really care what strangers think. But bottom line is it's a grocery store, they are **not** going to sell you rotten food.  Most of it is there because they need to clear shelf space for new product.  (As a side benefit, you get a lot of healthy food this way because guess what doesn't sell that great?  In the month I picked up a number of of these V8 fruit juice things, not the Fusion sugar bullshit but veggie blends, all 50%+ off.  Among other purchases.)

2) Debit cards make everything easy! Including spending too much.  After I take care of rent and my monthly bills, I withdraw $100 a week.  That's my budget for that week, including gas and food and all that.  

3) Related to #2, everything I think about buying becomes high priority or low priority.  High prio is fairly obvious; gas, essential food (not lousy snacks).  Low prio is just about everything else, and usually I only spend on that at the end of the week before withdrawing my next $100, or at the end of the month for bigger items (as long as it doesn't eat into the amount I want to save that month.  If I want to save $400, and I have $450 available, I really only have $50 available, is how I try to think of it.)

4) Related to #1, I go grocery shopping 2 to 4 times per week.  Yeah, that's time, time is money.  Instead of once every 2 weeks, and throwing out a lot of shit that's gone bad.  Plus, there are usually daily sales you don't normally see.  Awhile back Chex Mix was 10 bags for $10, normally $3 per bag.  So I got 10 bags of Chex Mix, I have about 6 months of snacking out of that, and only got that deal because I happened to be there that day.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a pretty typical teenager, B or C grades in most math classes in High School.  I "use" math allllllll the time in my work (real estate appraising).  There are a few problems as someone in between the love/hate spectrum.

1) Presentation.  My high school years were the late 90s.  We were still doing questions about trains leaving Chicago etc.  I don't think a single person in my entire school had ever been on a train.  I still have no idea why I had to learn how to graph curves.  If a class included practical applications (here are identical water bottle rockets, calculate how to get the most distance i.e. figure out how to plot a curve) maybe it would have kept my interest.  Even then, it would have been a neat practical application experiment, but something I don't actually "use."

2) Semi-purposeful obfuscation.  This happened in Junior College, when I was more mature and a good student. We were learning about...something.  It involved making a big triangle out of numbers in order to work out some sort of function? (Not how to calculate angles/etc in a triangle.  It was one number(integer?) at the top, two numbers under that, three under that, etc, and some xyz function thing. [Maybe this](http://world.mathigon.org/resources/Fractals/pascal1.png) )

Some part of my brain started tingling as the teacher was walking us through how to solve whatever this triangle number thing was. I found out on my own there was a shortcut to solve this.  I approached the teacher after class and asked him if my shortcut worked; he got a huge smile and said I was right.  He even asked me to teach the class my shortcut the next day. I was incredibly proud.  

The next day after class, I asked him why he didn't just teach this shortcut to begin with.  "Well, you're supposed to learn the longer and more difficult way first, because it's the proper way to learn it.  But you're right, your shortcut works faster."

Really? Edit: and along these lines, not being allowed to use a calculator.  I mentioned I use math all the time in my work.  Mostly, that's plugging in numbers while calculators/software actually do the equations for me. 

3) Math is a language.  And, again, a language not many people use that often. Imagine if you were forced to learn Farsi, Latin, Greek, Serbian, or Swahili throughout your K12 years, and lived in an area no one spoke those languages.  You'd grow up, forget most of the language because you never have anyone to speak it with, and eventually you'd "hate" it.  You would ask yourself "Why did I have to learn this language that I never use, and I forgot almost all of it because I never use it?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm right there with you, OP. I've installed 5 games in the past month (Star Trek Online, Sins of a Solar Empire, Cities Skylines, Europa Universalis IV, Warframe) all because I was burned out on games after "finishing" Witcher 3 and losing interested in Minecraft.  I tried going back to Fallout 4 and was tired of it by the time I reached Codsworth (about 5 minutes in - I'd played ~50 hours when I first bought it.)

I keep going back to Rocket League because I can just hop in, play for however long I feel like, and quit whenever I feel like.  Games that require me to accomplish specific tasks are just...tiring now.  

Might try Mount   Blade as it's the most upvoted at the moment.  If you find one that fits the bill, would be great to know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the other end of the spectrum - I picked up a GT Team Zaskar for cheap-ish because I loved the classic frame, and it was going to be my "project" bike (mostly because I couldn't afford a "proper" bike and need to spend a little bit at a time fixing this one up).

Took it to the bike shop that was my local cool shop when I was a teen, and this was 15 years later, highly gentrified and very high end.  I didn't really know it had changed that much as I'd just moved back.

They installed my brand new disc brakes on it.  Very, very, very poorly.  I ended up having to practically reinstall them on my own at home.  

Got the strongest impression that the shop looked at my bike, went "this is a piece of shit," and did the bare minimum work "installing" them.  </TEXT>

I mean, that's how you put it when you were trying to explain it.  

So my question still stands - why not ask your friend where they got the 45% figure from?  

And some people might think that making gross assumptions about another forum member being a part of the school board (with absolutely zero evidence), and then calling them a jagoff, and then saying you're better than them, isn't really "contributing."

They have always taken the ads out of the podcast that they put on the ESPN app (what I use when I missed shows in the past).  They included the occasional ad for ESPN content, usually 2 per hour at about 20 seconds per ad, but you're correct, all other ads were removed.

They still do this, yes.

What I am saying is that they used to remove ads, and the shows would have roughly 40 minutes of content per hour.  They still remove ads, and now the shows average 33 minutes of content per hour. </TEXT>

I know they started cutting out segments with music, but that shouldn't cut the show length by 5-8 minutes per hour.

<TEXT> You are hilarious.  I mean, sure, blame Californians.  All they're doing is taking advantage of the City Council members that continue to line their own pockets.

Instead of whining on reddit, you could go out and vote during the election, and get some people who care about the non-Northwest parts of Bend.

But I'm going to assume you (and probably everyone who complains about rent prices in Bend) didn't even vote for any local offices.  Or, if you did, you just filled in the bubble that matches your party affiliation without any regard to their policies on affordable housing.  

It was the **local** government that decided the UGB needed to expand in the Northwest, rather than any other part of the city that could provide cheaper housing.  In a few years, it will be the **local** government that decides Newport Avenue is way too small to handle all of the traffic in the NW (it already is), and starts paying exorbitant sums of money to buy up properties and build a proper roadway in the area.  

Put your Pabst and video games away, and start making yard signs for your campaign for a city council position in the next election, with the promise of making more affordable housing.  You'll get my vote.  

People making themselves rich from corrupt politicians is hardly unique to Bend. Go make a difference, or quit whining. </TEXT>

Edit: Wow this blew up faster than I thought, so just to help save time for everyone - 

Bodies - I also have almost every body I want.  Esper and Endo are the only ones I care about.

Wheels - I mostly only want animated ones.  Already have Spiralis, Zomba, FSL sienna, Pulsus green, and Voltaic.  Maybe want rare+ non-animated ones, but already have a lot of those too.

Trails - Again I already have a lot of these.  Outatime and Polygonal are the only non-imports I'm interested in; also interested in a few of the imports.

Antennas/Toppers - meh. Would take a pretty special one for me to care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow you really love to willfully ignore entire sentences to reach faulty conclusions. I'd hope an anthropologist could apply critical thinking.

Key words: 3rd-5th generation descendants; speaking the same language. 

That is very different than "all Europeans/Africans/Asians."

Did you get your degree from COCC? Your lack of reading comprehension is astounding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the content providers couldn't play nice with Netflix and had to launch a few dozen different services. To watch everything I want to watch I'd need to buy accounts to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon prime, hbo go, and that still probably would leave out a ton of shows/movies. At that point I'm paying more than the cable TV I ditched. Granted it's (mostly) ad free, but DVRs are mostly ad free too. 

They could have worked with Netflix, increased the monthly fees a bit, and had it all in one easy convenient location, like Spotify/gMusic do for music. Instead every channel needs its own service, most with their own fees. </TEXT>

If you're going to be a pedant just so you can force your anthropology 101 conclusion into the discussion, fine, I'll rephrase OP.

Does Bend have a population of ~95% who are 3rd-5th generation descendants of primarily European heritage, primarily speaking a single language, with very similar phenotypic traits? 

How's that work for ya, darlin? Now can you stop shoehorning first semester "race is a social construct" conclusions into a discussion when you know damn well what the person actually means? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Semi-Serious] Sports Boredom </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-20 03:25:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A point Dan brings up pretty often is he thinks part of the success of the show is people bored with other "normal" sports radio shows.  Definitely true in my case, but I wanted to bring up a similar point.  

I still catch parts of other shows from time to time while driving, and there's been an annoyingly common theme to almost all sports radio for awhile now, one even this show falls into.

The first round of the NBA playoffs - Two nights ago driving to the movies, I caught one show talking about how boring the first round of the playoffs are.

The masters - No Tiger Woods?  Boring.

NCAABB/Final Four - No Kentucky or Duke?  Boring.

Super Bowl - There aren't any good storylines with the Falcons and Patriots.  Boring.

Hockey and Soccer - They're just always boring.

World Series - The Cubs win, that's neat! ...and before the Gatorade had even dried from their uniforms, shows started saying how now that the Cubs have won?  You guessed it.  Now they're boring.  

______

It's reached a point where I'm starting to wonder if these sports radio hosts actually enjoy sports.  It really seems like what they actually enjoy is the bullshit drama surrounding sports.  But when it comes to the actual games themselves?  They can't wait to point out how boring each event is.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Neat read, but this doesn't address my biggest single issue with the film, which came up repeatedly.

Jennifer and Chris **constantly** voice out loud things that are either; a) very obvious, or b) just plain stated out loud already to begin with.

I'd have to watch the movie again to name all of the examples, but the two that come to mind **spoilers** - 

1) When they're trying to find the damaged component that's making the ship go nuts.  Cut to a montage of them searching the one area of the ship they've narrowed the problem down to.  They open a panel.  I'm pretty sure the dialogue goes exactly like - 

Chris - "This panel won't open."  
Jennifer - "That's a problem."  
Chris - "We were looking for a problem."  
Jennifer - "We should check this out."

All that was needed was a single wordless shot of them having trouble opening a panel and realizing it was the problem they were looking for.  Instead, a bunch of stupid dialogue that just explains something *already explained*.

2) And near the climax of saving the ship, same exact thing.  It's well established that when Chris goes out to recomboozle the fizzamatron with the engine, that it will burn him up and he'll die.

He gets to the engine.  He gets to the recomboozling of the fizzamatron.  

Chris - "Open the hatch!"  
Jennifer - "But you'll die!"  
Chris - "But if you don't, then the ship will die!"  
Jennifer - "But I love you and you'll die!"  

Again, all of that was previously explained, and a dialogue-free (or less dialogue) would have made such a stronger impact.  But instead, the filmmakers decided the viewing audience is too goddamn stupid to remember that he might die.  So it all has to be spelled out for a second time in really shitty dialogue.

If I watch the movie again, I'm pretty sure I could find many more examples of this.  The final cut gave zero respect to the viewers, and ruined a lot of the pacing/drama by having the characters spell out what is happening/will happen at almost every moment.  

I agree with the start of this youtube video - it wasn't a terrible movie, and I'm sure I'll watch it again from time to time over the coming years.  But my god those moments were so insulting and just plain bad.

<TEXT> I enjoy listening to this one particular sports radio show that kinda makes fun of sports radio shows.  Last season there was a particularly brutal play in the NFL that left one player (Luke Kuechly) sobbing on the field because he was concussed so badly.  The host was talking about how shocking it was to see.  

He read a tweet on air  that was something like, "Hey Dan, this is a MAN'S sport.  Take off your panties!"

So the host spent the next 5 minutes on air describing himself "taking off his panties." And holy shit that was hilarious to hear.

Re:Pollos- Jimmy knows Mike gets into some pretty sketchy stuff, and the vagueness of it from Mike's end would (to me) imply being very careful. "Go here, get a coffee, watch for a specific car/person, I'm not telling you anything else." Again, it seems like Jimmy should know something probably bad is going on and to be extra careful. Not forgetting his entire life history of cons/shadiness and acting like you or I might act in the same situation. 

But yeah I can see how Jimmy's emotions probably overrode his judgement re:Chuck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did anyone else feel like Jimmy's actions this episode were pretty out of character?

His stakeout in Los Pollos was **so** amateur. Jimmy is a "professional" con artist. He should be really good at casually observing people/events without raising suspicion. The way he was so awkward and obvious this episode seemed really out of place.

And the second example, maybe future episodes will prove me wrong here... But in the previous episode, the second Chuck tricked Ernie, I immediately thought Jimmy would see through the obvious ruse. Instead he just walked right into the obvious trap.

Both of those seemed really out of character to me. </TEXT>

Starting with the episode where Homer goes to clown college (Homer makes his announcement, she says she'll have a glass of wine), then the Hank Scorpio episode (dramatic music as she has two glasses), and another episode or two in the seasons following she starts drinking quite a bit more. 

But not sure if they developed that potential arc further after that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Exodus, but my biggest problem is when I don't know what I want to watch and try just browsing.

Most Popular and People Watching are essentially the same lists of movies, just slightly different orders. Genres doesn't work very well, because almost every movie gets tagged with 10 different genres (for instance, Dr. Strange ends up in Action, Adventure, Sci Fi, Thriller, Suspense, probably more...), so they again end up as almost identical lists to Most Popular and People Watching.  

And the biggest problem with basically every browsing method, is they're almost all movies released in the last 2-3 years.  I've started browsing by Certificates (ratings), and that mixes in a decent (but not good) amount of older movies.  

But, the certificates lists are fairly static.  

I'm hoping someone found a script/plugin/something that shuffles any/all of the lists, so movies from the 70s/80s/90s/00s show up in any/all of them. </TEXT>

I'm probably ditching Netflix at this point. Removing the things I've already watched, there's maybe only ~6 hours of content added every few months that's worth watching.  They're starting to turn History Channel in terms of just adding a ton of horrible awful shit in order to fill their catalog. 

And that VPN service I purchased after the recent new ISP fiasco? Oh, Netflix won't let me use that.  Neat.

Netflix has spent way too much money on Netflix Originals lately, instead of bolstering their non-Netflix content. 

For me, Netflix has become $10 a month for Futurama and It's Always Sunny reruns, and maybe a movie or two a month. I'm already borderline "Fuck it, I'll cancel Netflix."  If the rating system pissed me off as much as OP, it would be enough to push me to cancelling my service, since I'm already heading that way anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then I fail to see your confusion about animation holding up. 

Individual stylized backgrounds (as opposed to using plain backgrounds that loop), a huge amount of lighting/shading effects (as opposed to mostly flat lighting), minimal but well done 3d blending...

Go watch the simpsons episode where Bart gets a driver's license/gets stuck in Tennessee. Watch the part where the "camera" pans from the side of the car to the rear (I think when Nelson throws the toy dog out the window). 

In the DVD commentary they marvel at what an amazing job the animators did... Creating a very simple 90 pan with some amount of perspective thrown in. And it looks absolutely terrible nowadays. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mac quotes Genesis as the first part of his day. The part he quotes goes - 

*And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.*  
*And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.*

Which leads to the "obvious" conclusion - his first activity is about water.

If he continued reading the next few lines...

*And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.*  
*And God called the dry land Earth;*

Really, that chapter was about the creation of Earth.  But of course Mac interprets it to be all about water.

The day it became recreational-legal here I went to my local shop and asked for an eighth. "Sorry but since we sell medicinal marijuana, we have to apply for a new permit for allowing recreational sales.  And we only are allowed to submit the permits now, and it will take 8 to 10 months for the permit to be approved."

Now I can buy no problems and the prices aren't bad.  But in Prineville it's still illegal (because the Federal government still says so, which is funny since it's such a Republican area, and normally they hate the Federal government telling them what to do...) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Discussion] Fans of "hard" scifi - what are your views on veganism? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Disclaimer:** I am not a vegan, I've never been a vegan, I'm not trying to promote any vegan agenda. Just a thought I had recently, curious about others.

There are a good deal of near-future "hard" scifi novels out there, and there's a near-universal consensus about humans travelling the solar system - we'll be eating a lot of protein that doesn't come from an animal. 

As someone who's always wanted to live in "the future" (yeah yeah appreciate what I have now blah blah that's another discussion) I found it curious why I wouldn't take one of the "easiest" steps to emulate those characters and stories I enjoy. 

Why don't I eat like they do? There's the obvious answer - I'm on Earth, meat is readily available, why not consume it. But, I also find myself mocking people who eat "fake meat," even though they're consuming a diet much closer to my scifi heroes than I do. 

Anyway, just curious about others' thoughts on the subject. </TEXT>

The crew includes an englishman, african, a jewish man escaping the inquisition, a samurai, and a few others.

<TEXT> My biggest gripes with google music - 

1) Playlist merging (the minor quirk, for making megaplaylists).  In spotify you could just open your current queue and merge it into a pre-existing playlist.  In gMusic you have to save your queue as a new playlist, and then merge the two playlists.

2) International music - I didn't play much of this when I was a (paid) Spotify user, so I don't know if Spotify is any better. But, for one instance, I tried a radio station based off Serge Gainsbourg - Requiem Pour Un Con, a 60s/70s jazzy french tune.  The station basically became "play anything french, it doesn't matter what genre or decade or anything, if it's french it goes in this playlist." (Some early thumbs up/down action helped steer it to what I wanted.)

3) Switching which device is playing.  Maybe I haven't searched settings enough.  On Spotify it was super nice when leaving my house to switch what was playing on my comp to my phone.  With gMusic it seems like both devices have their own setups and you can't just toggle which device is playing the exact same playlist.

But the better radio functions alone are worth it for me, plus you get free YouTube Red (no ads, can play youtube audio only, can play youtube while turning your phone's screen off).  

Plus, the security problems I had with Spotify.  For me, gMusic is definitely worth it for the same monthly fee. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only reason I can think people do this is to level up their rank faster by getting "completed match" points.  Most of these weren't people trolling after bad goals or whatever.  From the start of the match, they hold down the accelerate button, and do nothing else, at all, at any point.  

This has seemed to be more common the past few months...

If the reason people do this really is to level up their ranking, maybe a system where they need a minimum of 200-250 points in order to get the "completed match" reward? So they have to at least contribute a little? 

I don't know why this is a thing or the best way to prevent it, but when a large majority of my games are 3v2 because of some jerk avoiding afk detection, matches don't feel so fun. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (Note: This isn't a "buy books online or buy ebooks you big dummy" debate, please save those comments.)

I would drop by my local B N about once every month or two to check out their "New Science Fiction" section, typically 3-5 bookcases.  This was the easiest/best way for me to browse a whole lot of titles/authors at once, sometimes buying a hardback copy on the spot, sometimes buying the ebook later. I found a lot of my favorite books and writers this way. 

Last time I went in, there was no "New Science Fiction" section anymore.  (Apparently, there aren't any "New" sections for any categories anymore.)  I spoke to the manager of my store, hoping it was a local decision. Sadly, it isn't. 

The manager also told me, "The reason for the change is we found most B N customers enter the store looking for a specific author." I asked how having a "New" section prevented that before, and didn't get a great answer. 

I'm pretty disappointed because most online services are still pretty terrible when it comes to recommendations, and it's always a bit upsetting anywhere when a useful feature is taken away for specious reasons.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] Song - New-ish electronic song, around 120bpm, female singer and a *heavily* distorted male singer. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-03 11:42:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1) Even though it's (roughly!) 120bpm, the beat is "slow and plodding" and very simple through most (all?) of the song. For the most part it's just a steady kick/snare throughout. I think. 

2) The rest of the music was a few synth-y sounds, kinda 80's style in being long drawn out single notes, nothing too complex. The synths were mostly a higher pitch. 

3) The verses go back and forth between a typical female singer, and a very distorted male singer.  I'm not entirely sure you can really make understand many of the guy's words. Most of the pitch was removed so it sounded like a spoken word robot, recorded on an answering machine tape from the 80s, then that tape was thrown into a river for a few years, fished out, and played back over this song. 

4) The chorus is mostly the female, clear, high pitched normal singing. It goes something like "You make me some-THING / So what can I say / You make me hap-py booo-ooy / I can't explain"

The song was coming up on some Spotify radio for me for awhile, but then I stopped hearing it come up, and ended up cancelling my Spotify and switching to Google Music. 

Possible artists that I might have started a radio station from that led to this song coming up in the first place - Eskmo, Opiou, M Machine </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a recent transition from Spotify to gMusic, that's my one complaint with the gMusic service so far is their total lack of properly cataloging international music? Like I put in Serge Gainsbourg - Requiem Pour Un Con as a radio station starter, a French 70s jazz song.  And the radio just ends up being "play anything French, it doesn't matter what genre or decade or anything, if it's French, throw it in that playlist."

<TEXT> I'm actually interested in all of those. I follow the NFL, and a player I respected quite a bit (since retired) played at a very high level at a much later age than most players at his position. In an interview he was asked how he was still playing at a high level when he was so old. His response was tl;dr "Maybe 2 or 3 times a week, I have a small portion of meat as like a side, otherwise I'm vegetarian." 

Since then I've taken quite a keen interest in, at the very least, severely limiting the amount of meat I eat. Can't say I could ever go full vegan, but I certainly see benefits in just about everyone eating a hell of a lot less meat for the health/environmental reasons as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, once Netflix really started to gain traction in the mid 2000s, the traditional media companies that gave them content started freaking out, and made new deals intended to hamstring Netflix. (That's why some titles only appear for limited times now, or seasons of tv shows take a little longer to reach Netflix than before, among other things.)

So they turned to producing content, to reduce their reliance on traditional media. And, like almost every cable channel, about 21 out of 24 hours per day is total crap.   </TEXT>

When Fred Johnson is meeting with the Mormon dude and they're riding the little cart on tracks, they're firmly planted on the ground standing normally, even though there should be no gravity. When they make their escape to the Roci for the first time, gravity is off, they say out loud "turn off your magboots and go quick!", turn off their boots, and then run like they're on Earth, just slightly more slowly. 

If you're really going to get worked up over things like that, you may wish to stop watching the show now.  </TEXT>

They still think this is a malware download.  It has been one and a half years, and they do not realize this is being done by logging in through the website, and adding devices to user accounts there.

They still don't know.  I found out about this issue last night.

We trust them with credit cards?  This particular attack doesn't reveal cc info, but what does that say about their overall security, that they don't realize it's being done through their website?

Edit: Email I received today, bold for emphasis.

Hi there,
Thanks for your feedback.

We're always looking to improve Spotify in any way we can. We cant say now if or when any specific release will be out, but as soon as we've got something to announce, we'll let everyone know on the Spotify blog.

Also, we would suggest that you update your security software and application on your devices. **Sometimes, it's better to have your personal devices secured twice the normal security that everyone has :)**

If there's anything else, we're just an email away.

All the best, </TEXT>

But the other worry in this particular instance it's that it's allowing the Spotimb 0.2.1 exploit, which they've known about since July 15 of 2015, and they're still not interested in a relatively simple solution to 1) stop password mining, and 2) stop an active exploit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Full writeup I did trying to explain it on /r/Spotify - 

**Better TL;DR by Vice Magazine in 2015** - [Here](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/hackers-are-sabotaging-my-spotify-playlists-with-awful-ambient-music)

_____


Spotify's IT security just scared the shit out of me with how incompetent it is. 

1) Try logging out, and when going to log back in, type the wrong password.  Keep doing that, over and over.  **There is no limit to the number of password guesses a potential hacker is limited to.**

Notice how almost every website on earth has a system where after so many failed login attempts, you're locked out until you can verify another way?

2) This led to my receiving the Spotiamb 2.0 exploit.  An exploit that Spotify has known about [since July of 2015](https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/v3_1/forumtopicpage/board-id/001/thread-id/134965/page/1)

(For those unaware, Spotiamb forces its way into your "Devices" list, frequently trying to either force-play certain songs, or just pausing/unpausing Spotify.)

You'll also note that the forum regarding Spotiamb is set to "Solved!" You can follow the steps on that page and get rid of Spotiamb, this is true.  **But only for however long it takes to brute-force your new password.** 

3) It's not wise, but many people use the same account name/password across a variety of websites/apps/etc.  If you have ever gotten Spotiamb (the forum runs to 8 pages), the hacker(s) know one of your username/password combinations.  Are you certain you don't use the same combo on other popular websites?

4) From that forum, Spotify's first (only?) public email reply regarding Spotiamb - 

" Thanks for your email. We understand that you're having issues with Spotiamb 0.2.1. 

Spotiamb wasn't created by Spotify. Please contact them and they'll help out with this.

We're always here if you have any problems with the Spotify service itself though. Just let us know!

Cheers,

Marc"

Wow, great response to a security threat, Marc.

______

**TL;DR** - Hackers can brute force guess your password on Spotify. I hope you don't use the same username/password combinations elsewhere.

Edit: Even if you use Free Spotify, hackers can still brute force guess.  I've never used the Facebook login, but I assume that's halfway fucking secure.

<TEXT> The article mentions the exploit (Spotiamb 0.2.1, still an active exploit) that can screw with playlists. 

However, with login details, a hacker could potentially see your name, gender, zip code, email address, and possibly mobile phone number. 

On a personal note, I emailed Spotify earlier regarding this.  They didn't care then, and they don't now. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Scents of the Months] Next Up Nominations </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Inaugural thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelifestyle/comments/5c4x4v/scents_of_the_months_novdec_inaugural_thread/)

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelifestyle/comments/5it8ej/scents_of_the_months_update_1/) - includes some reviews of the products. My opinions there are still pretty much the same.

**TL;DR** - Picking a scent "theme," and purchasing various scented-products in that theme.  Post what you got and what you thought of it next update.

_________________________________________

Nominations? Previous theme was "The Woods of Winter" - found some fun woodsy/smokey stuff!  

I would say a good nomination should have a theme, instead of just "mint, because mint."  Hoping to see some good ideas! </TEXT>

At /r/MaleLifestyle/ I started a ["Scents of the months"](https://www.reddit.com/r/malelifestyle/comments/5it8ej/scents_of_the_months_update_1/) thread, so that instead of smelling like MEN, or smelling like random chemicals, we might actually smell like real things.

<TEXT> My main thing, and the rest of this post will just be dripping in irony because of it -

Stop making everything about me.  

(But hey, we're dealing with depression, we have to talk about these things.)

By that I mean having imaginary arguments/confrontations, which I talked about a bit in the /r/depression/ post. 

And, oddly, it's also made me very selfish, in some ways.  When I find myself in a bad place, I ask, "What's something I can do to make something better," and frequently, I am the thing that needs to get better.  

Similarly, the line, "Why blame myself for all I need help for?"  

People need help.  I need help.  There is no shame in asking for that help, whether it's asking someone you love, a stranger, or yourself. Last night, at around 10PM, I called my parents and asked for them to come over, while it was snowing, because I was starting to hyperventilate and just needed a hug.

It wasn't easy asking for that, at all.  Why am I making my elderly parents drive through the snow late at night? 

I needed help.  They helped. </TEXT>

It seems like **everyone** knows G2A sells game keys, the **vast majority of which** are stolen. And people knew that before this post, but still used the site.

And, someone got scammed, and now it's, "I'll never use G2A again."  Even though that same person might have known with 99% surety, that the keys they were buying were probably thanks to theft.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't a PM right?  Others can see this?

One of the people I've been talking to is my mom, actually.  I'm 36, she's 70, but alcoholism runs in our family and I know she takes antidepressants. Her house was the closest to where the incident occurred, and I (somehow) managed to make it that far, walk in, and collapse on the ground sobbing. 

But after awhile, I did tell her, "I faced my suicide today. And, the silver lining is, I said no."  As I said it's not making me happy.  But there is a relief. 

So um, follow up, and this part's still being processed kinda.  I live in a semi-rural area, and my job involves a lot of driving, and winter and all that bullshit.  That's what lead to the event. 

And I had another job.  Today.  Less than 24 hours later. (Late edit for context: it was about another 100 miles of driving.)

I called my mom.  I told her, I need you to do this for me, but I will be lying down in the back seat, under a blanket the whole time.  Because, if I can't get through that, I might never drive again. (This is part of my depression post - why blame myself for all I need help for?)

Mostly got through it.  There was a total panic attack near catastrophe, but also another good thought.  

I was lying down in the back seat of a car.  Under a blanket.  Not driving.  Not seeing.  I was not in control, of anything.

And I realized, there are always going to be things I am not in control of, like a meth-head semitruck driver nearly killing me.  But, there are also other things I'm not in control of, that I can be in control of.  </TEXT>

The most important thing is "one day at a time." Don't worry about two weeks from now and maybe you'll just crash again, or a month from now and maybe there's some great/crappy event that you know you'll get drunk  over, etc.

Don't worry about the future.  Just ask yourself, "Can I make it through today without drinking?" and do your best to make it through today, and only today. 

And having a fuckup doesn't make you a fuckup. Maybe you'll have a slip. Oh well. It doesn't mean give up, just go back to asking yourself, "Can I make it through today without drinking?" and answering yes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heard a good bit on the radio about Romo yesterday.  Not my opinions here necessarily, but it was interesting.

Tony Romo is possibly the best pocket passer playing today. You can argue Brady, for sure he's great, but his passes are usually very quick, sub-2-second release.  Tony will stand in the pocket for 6, 7, 8 seconds, and when he feels pressure, he just makes tiny little adjustments to his footwork and body positioning, keep his cool, and deliver the pass. 

In the pocket, feeling pressure, Alex Smith will throw it away or go for the easy check down; Aaron Rodgers might spin and scramble; Brady would have already gotten rid of the ball.  But Romo will just make small changes to his position/posture, stay in the pocket, and make the pass.

I'd never really heard that about Romo until yesterday, but it was interesting to hear. </TEXT>

For the first week of trying to change my thoughts, I pretty much woke up every single day feeling like I was going to break into sobs at any point through the day. I still get that feeling a lot.

<TEXT> Two simple lines from a song, and they've really been the perfect description for my depression.  

I've been dealing with depression since puberty I suppose. Lately I think I've been doing a pretty good job of getting myself out of funks, and part of it has been a personal philosophy along the lines of the title.

You'll see how this is a bit awkward for me to talk about in a second, but if it helps someone else dealing with depression, than I'll be any amount of awkward required.

_____
**Personal Story**  

For the past few months I've been trying, and it's very hard, to live by the mantra, "Stop making everything about me."

Relating to the title (I cannot be sure I see the future, in my head) - did some jerk cut me off in traffic? I'm imagining a confrontation with that person, where I'm yelling in their face for being such a big dumb jerk.  Or maybe some cute girl helped me out while I was shopping, and I'm imagining a date with this girl, maybe an entire relationship, and then I'm back to reality and single and sad again. 

I think a lot of my depression comes from "seeing the future, in my head," and they're all futures that don't exist. Living in alternate realities. 

"Why blame myself for all I need help for" - part two.  There have been crazy snow/ice storms around where I live for the past month. Two days ago my car got stuck while driving, and it took 3 people to push me out.  Not 3 people at once.  First one person, that wasn't working, then a second person joined in, still wasn't working, then a third.  

Humiliating.  Absolutely embarrassing and humbling moment. And the whole time I'm sitting there, I'm cursing at a God I don't actually believe in, like this whole experience was just him getting me stuck to laugh at my misery.

C'mon.  I'm not that important. Cars get stuck in snow.  It's something that happens. I needed help, and thankfully, three kind souls helped.  

Why blame myself for all I need help for? 

______

**Coping mechanisms**

I feel I'm already rambling, so maybe if you've already read the above, that's enough to help.  But here's what I've been doing whenever I feel those depressed thoughts creeping up (and they're **always** creeping up).

1) "What's something around me that I can make better?"  - Clean your room, make some nice food, exercise, customize your computer, do some yardwork.  But also things like - a few weeks ago, I saw a neighbor across the street furiously shoveling snow. I mean, he looked young and healthy and I was still worried he'd have a heart attack, at the rate he was shoveling. 

It was one of the hardest things I've done lately, because I am not good with people.  But I went into my house, poured an extra large shot of whiskey, and went over to his place and asked if he needed a drink. Ended up chatting for awhile, and yeah he's going through some shit. 

The point being - I tried to make something around me better.  (I think? Who knows.  An attempt was made.) 

As another short anecdote - I had an absolutely terrible day yesterday, and driving home, I was doing nothing **but** getting into imaginary fights with people. It took several repetitions, but I kept thinking, "I'm in a super bad place right now, what's something I can do to make something better?" - My answer was, go home, drink whiskey, play video games. Childish, maybe. But as soon as I thought of that, I felt this peace. And I went home, and did exactly that, and it felt amazing. (Whiskey and video games isn't always the answer :P )

2) this is my emergency backup - "What's that?" Basically, there's always something around you to get curious about.  Always. I have a coffee mug sitting in front of me.  What blend is the coffee? Why is this region a good coffee region, compared to other regions?  Now I'm googling things, and learning things, and I'm not sitting in a depressed puddle of ego.

______

TL;DR - Sorry there isn't a good TL;DR.  Hopefully this helps even just a little bit, though.

Edit - The song is "Promise me a rose garden" by The M Machine.  I've been playing it a lot, lately. </TEXT>

Um, nope, the Antonio Brown thing kinda represents exactly what Dan loves.  Sports is entertainment.  It is there for fun.  He snapchatted a haircut for 40 minutes, and avoided a few dozen questions like "So the Patriots are 9-0 at home on the road in the rain when trailing at halftime by 3 points,  how will your defense respond to inside guard formation shifts on third down?"  

If you really want to hear those questions, and the shitty answers that will follow, then you really don't get the show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me start my reply with - I absolutely believe Aaron Rodgers is the greatest quarterback I have ever personally witnessed, and possibly all time (I don't know enough history to say so). There was a play in maybe the second quarter where I was yelling at a friend to watch the replay, because even though it was a mostly forgettable play (I think it was a 2nd 8 completion for 5 yards?) - the pass itself was so freaking amazing. 

So let's start there.  I am in no way questioning Rodgers's performance or anything like that. 

I will also completely concede that box scores don't tell the whole story.  See: Chiefs scoring 2 td's, allowing 0 td's, and losing. 

So, minutiae aside, Dak did have the better stats.  Dak did play an amazing game, as a fourth round rookie making his first playoff start.  

Returning to the very original parent comment - 

He's a Rookie and he matched Aaron Rodgers (okay maybe not matched, but certainly competed with)

I think (my opinion, you can disagree) that OP's original intention was very true - as a rookie, he went toe to toe with possibly the greatest QB to ever play. 

I don't think it's terribly incorrect, and (again, IMO), I don't think it's terribly disrespectful towards Rodgers to say that Dak was able to hold his own against him.  </TEXT>

About 3 hours after this post I inadvertently (long story) ended up getting an XB1 for cheap anyway. But I think that's probably what I would have gone with anyway, it seemed like a lot of the PS4 benefits were things I wasn't particularly interested in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also want to point out that both the PS4 and the XB1 have functionality where you can stream games to your PC and play from there if you decide to put the PC in a different room.

That's fascinating to hear. 

I played around with Plex some before.  This sounds like a pretty great solution. 

The XB1 having an HDMI input sounds like a very deciding factor for the setup I'm picturing.  Wow, this has all been great info.  Thanks a ton! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Which console provides the best living room connectivity options with my PC? [Sony TV/Windows 10 PC] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-04 22:24:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Currently, my PC is in my living room, connected to my TV. I am considering a console (for one game and one game only), so most of the other pros/cons can be thrown out the window (pardon the pun). 

I would like to move my PC to my bedroom, replaced by a console in the living room.  I would like this console to very easily integrate with my PC for watching files I've downloaded/etc.  

I mention Sony TV because, while it kind of wirelessly recognizes my PC, it doesn't really do it very well.  Which is where I'd probably lean towards the Xbone. But in my limited time with those, I don't recall those being particularly well integrated either.  

**TL;DR** - I want to play one game.  When I'm not playing that game, I want to watch movies off of my PC wirelessly. What works best in that regard?

Edit : I may also keep my PC in my living room regardless.  Would a wired connection make any difference? </TEXT>

This is kinda "start to finish."  Starts with the device plugged in, putting it on, the frustration getting it synced, then using it once synced.  Keep in mind, this only arrived this morning, and it's now past midnight (happy new year!) and I've had a few to drink among other things. 

Note : I point to my elbow a few times, and shake out my hand a few times. The elbow is important because in a way that's your "projector" and your hand then creates the screen in front of that. 

So it's important to keep in mind where your elbow is.  And sometimes if you're just losing control, give your arm a shake, might have to resync, but then everything is refocused.

Edit : just saw the video missed most of the important bits, making a new one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The pregame interview with Miller was kinda frustrating to watch even as a Charger fan, when he was asked about the changes to the defense, and you know he can't give an honest answer so he gives the stereotypical bs.

I would have loved for him to go "are you fucking insane?! we lost three to five starters?! this isn't the same fucking defense as last year! get that through your fucking head! Edit: It's week fucking 16, and you still can't see that the names on the roster are different?! Fuck!"

Edit2 I know the number is probably a lot higher than 3 to 5 starters </TEXT>

<TEXT> (Note: In the spirit of the thread, keep in mind this is meant for levity, and these might be my opinions, but I might also be strongly exaggerating them in a Frank Costanza kinda way.)

I got grievances with Chargers fans calling for Mike McCoy to get fired.  

You peoples!  The audacity! Do you realize we're one Philip Rivers away from being the Jaguars?!

We have been decimated by injuries for two seasons now.  Two! Decimated! Our division is now one of the toughest in football! 

Yes, McCoy can go too conservative too quickly. But that's precisely because he's a young/inexperienced head coach, without the trust of the ownership, OR THE FANS! 

Belichik can get away with weirdass risky playcalling, because he knows the next morning, people won't be calling for his head! 

The team is a mess, for many, many, so very many reasons. Mike McCoy isn't one of the bigger reasons. I think what he's been able to do considering all of the injuries and his lack of experience has been admirable.  And you! Should be! Ashamed! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Watched the first episode.  Some of the acting parts were eh.  But overall enjoyed it, looked forward to the rest.  It looked like it was continuing Myth Busters, but adding a twist to make it unique.  Cool.

Then episode 2, where it was nothing but dramatic reenactments with maybe one experiment/test performed?  Episode 3 the same but with no experiments/tests?  

By episode 4 I just started fastforwarding through, looking at what the thumbnail looked like on the timeline to see if the thumbnail was acting or experiments.  And it looked like there wasn't a single one.

I don't have a problem if they want to do something that isn't Myth Busters.  That's perfectly understandable.  But the first episode of this series made it look like it would be a lot different than the rest of it turned out. 

TL;DR - first episode involved experiments/building things, then they stopped doing that. </TEXT>

I am fairly certain I could cherry-pick stats that make your favorite player look like the worst player of all time.  I could find weird stats like "when trailing one score in the fourth quarter on the road with the temperature below 20 degrees, aaron rodgers (or tom brady/manning/etc) is the worst QB of all time."

You are doing to his overall argument what stupid sports fans do when they do that.  You're cherry picking quotes instead of stats.  Look at the overall body of work instead.   </TEXT>

But like with the Assassin's Creed read lately...is he really screwing it up each time?  I loved today's show partly because first I thought "wow when he says jeremy irons he sounds like the mariota-growing-up-in-front-of-our-eyes read" and he immediately brought up he couldn't say Irons.  Then later I thought he really was saying Fassbender (and the French chick's) name differently each time.  And he immediately said he read it differently each time!

Do I need to delete this post so that the Stugotz Army doesn't assassinate me to keep the truth quiet? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's also stupid branding. If it was just generic "here's a dude with powers in a weird reality" it'd probably do fine. Why they felt the need to attach AC to the title is weird. How many more people are you getting by making it an AC movie, versus how many you'll lose because "oh it's another stupid video game movie."

Felt the same way about the WoW movie. Just make it a generic orc/humans/magic movie and it probably would have done okay. Instead, WoW is attached which just leads to a disappointed fanbase and a general public that dismisses the movie bc it's based on a video game. </TEXT>

1) a very boring game that becomes very tense in the final 5 minutes, or,  
2) Smashville makes the other team look like amateurs and more or less walks up and down the field.

<TEXT> If you want a random guess about why the over is more popular - 

I would guess a subconcious effect, where betting the under is almost the only bet one makes where the worst outcome is the best? 

You bet to win.  You win when other teams win. But in the case of the under, you win when both teams fail? Maybe there's just something fundamentally uncomfortable about picking that outcome? 

Sure people will bet on the Browns going 0/16, but those are more joke/prop bets.  When it comes to typical day-to-day betting, the under is the only real bet where you're hoping for the worst outcome. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Scents of the Months] Update 1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-17 07:30:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey y'all! Here's the first update. Hoping some of you are still interested!

[Original post with the idea behind Scents of the Months](https://redd.it/5c4x4v) - personal reviews below.

People who joined after the initial post - what did you get?  What are your thoughts so far? 

Next theme -  Open to suggestions! But don't just name a scent or two, have a concept around why those scents should be chosen. We're in Winter in the North, so I might suggest something like woodsy/berry?  But it's also Summer in the South, so maybe coconut/citrus would be better? 

If you feel like participating, throw out an idea!

Also, doing it every 2 months, waiting on things to ship etc...maybe every 2 months is too fast of a turnaround for this sort of thing? Would 3 months+ be better, with interim checkups like this?

**Actual Reviews**

*Wild Man of the Woods Deodorant* - 10/10  

This has been a great alternative to normal pitsticks. The woodsy scent seems to be mostly derived from cloves; not necessarily a bad thing, but if you don't care for cloves this isn't for you most likely.  I used it regularly to start my day and always seemed to do fine.  Recently there was a huge snowfall here, which involved lots of shoveling of snow. The shoveling was a hasty idea, after already showering.  So I thought I'd give it a true test and just apply this deodorant after doing a physical activity.  Even a few hours after that, I do feel very fresh smelling, and yes even a nice back-of-the-nose woodsy/clovey scent.  It was from an Etsy dealer, and they included a bonus sample product which is what brought this from a 9 to a 10.  

*3x samples of colognes - Cheeky Teaky 7/10, Smoke 'n Oak 9/10, Mood for Oud* 8/10.

Smoke 'n' Oak is exactly what I was looking for, and I will be ordering it.  But Mood for Oud also got my attention.  Basically, of the three samples - Cheeky Teaky is on the sweet end of the spectrum.  The smell was enjoyable, but not what I was looking for.  Mood for Oud was a much darker scent, almost but not quite musk.  Smoke 'n' Oak was seemingly a blend of the two? Regardless of how they arrived at the blend of scents, smoke 'n' oak pretty much brought to mind exactly that when I put it on.  Mood for Oud I could see as possibly a more situational cologne.   If I had to classify them - Cheeky Teaky is the "hey it's a fun Friday night" kind of smell; Mood for Oud is a more intimate one-on-one kind of smell; and Smoke 'n' Oak is a day to day (but still unique) kind of smell. 

*Sandalwood and Manuka Facial Scrub* - 10/10

This shit is amazing.  I had no idea "Manuka Honey" was a thing before and a friend enlightened me.  Call it bovine entrails, whatever it is, I love it. I've always had very large pores between my cheekbones/brow.  Strangely, this is showing a really positive effect on one side but less so on the other side.  Regardless, my skin feels fantastic after using it.

*Crabtree   Evelyn Sandalwood Bodywash* - 9/10 

Probably the priciest per/use item I got. I have one small complaint, which is that it is *ridiculously* thick.  Get out your tennisball grippers, you'll need a good amount of effort to get a halfway decent amount out.  Aside from that - the scent lasts a good long time; a small amount goes a long way (thankfully); and the scent in general is pretty awesome. 

*Pipe Smoke Organic Body Lotion* - 8.5/10  

Warning - very strong.  I received this item at the same time as my cologne samples.  Day 1 I used both; told that I had way too much scent on.  Day 2 tried very minimal amounts of both; same result.  Day 3 tried just the body lotion; same result.

It is a very great smell, very much along the lines of the smokey/woodsy scents I was looking for.  And, another bonus, the etsy dealer included a free sample of a body oil.  

I would give this a 9, maybe a 10 because of the extra sample; but it's apparently so strong it has limited application.  Post-shower, going to bed alone?  Sure! Post-shower, and a few hours until work? Sure!  Definitely not something to use if going out in the near future.

*Candle* - was shit. There was a reason it was a discount sale.  I hope no one bought one of them thanks to the OP.

<TEXT> (First time viewer here, no spoilers please.) 

I just reached the point 1/2 way through where Philip learns his other son (Misha) could be pulled off the front line if Philip wished.  

I almost expected this to become a 15 minute long mostly-monologue diatribe about how anguished he is over what the correct choice is to make.  

I am paused right now, maybe this episode will become that...

But instead, Philip said no and walked away and that was the end of all of that (so far).  

This was so awesome on so many levels for me. The several-commercial-break-long-speech I imagined would have involved Philip lamenting "what right do I have to determine his future when I didn't even know he existed until 2 months ago etc etc".  

Instead Philip realized he had no right to interfere in the life of a son he had no part in raising? And he just...left it at that, show moved on.

That's kind of a breath of fresh air in terms of modern TV...purposely foregoing an extra 15 minutes of time wasting internal debate to arrive at the Subway Fresh Take Episode Conclusion (looking at you, Walking Dead).

There are so many other parts of this show I'm dying to get into, but I still need to catch up to all of you first. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [OC] Bend Trump versus Bend Bernie - who would you vote for? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-08 05:47:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Preface** - friend and I were joking around about running for city council next year, one of us as Bend Trump, other as Bend Bernie. We made some jokes, I decided to fully write out the first ever debate between Bend Trump and Bend Bernie.  I hope you enjoy.  (Also this isn't meant to be serious in any way, please note the mention of joking/jokes. I was hoping I was making fun of both equally. If I appear to have a bias, I apologize and it wasn't intended.)

_______________

**Moderator** : Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the first ever debate between Bend Trump and Bend Bernie. Candidates, first question - the Central Oregon economy seems to be rebounding, but there are still questions about long term middle class jobs.  Bend Trump, well start with you.


**Bend Trump** : First I would like to say it is an honor, and a privilege, to be here tonight.  You should all feel very honored and privileged that I am here.  


My job plan is simple - Bend jobs for Bend residents.  We have these sneaky, criminal elements, robbers, thugs, rapists, and theyre coming down to Bend from Redmond, and theyre stealing. Bend. Jobs. They come take our money, our Bend money, then they take off and use Bend money in Redmond.  This isnt right, and I will put a stop to this immediately by tearing up every square inch of Highway 97 between Bend and Redmond. And I will make Redmond pay for it.


**Moderator** :  Um.  An interesting take... Bend Bernie, your response?


**Bend Bernie** :  Yes, the economy is growing...for some people. Your real estate brokers, owners of dealerships, your uh, your local brewery owner who has just released his 100th different variation of an IPA. For those people the economy is growing, but try telling people working two jobs the economy is growing. 


That is why I want to level the playing field.  My administration would pursue the implementation of a policy whereby everyone, not just the rich and not just the poor, but everyone, would have to work two jobs. I believe this is fair, and I believe this is right. 


**Moderator** : How does that help anything? At all?


**Bernie** : It will Re! Distribute! The wealth!


**Moderator** : No, it really wouldnt.


**Bernie** : Well it Re! Distributes! Where the wealth is located. Some! Times!


**Moderator** : [pause] Mmmkaaaay.  Moving on.  The next question should be a simple one.  If elected, what would your first City Councilial action be?  Bend Ber-


**Trump** : Trees. [Stares]


**Moderator** : -nie well...start with...nevermind.  Bend Trump, um.  Trees?


**Trump** : Trees. [Stares]


**Moderator** : What about the...  The trees?


**Trump** : The trees. Have got.  To go.  [Stares]


**Moderator** : The trees have go-


**Trump** : Gotta go! Bye bye!  Look, Chris, or whatever your name is.  Youre...too little for me to remember.  And I dont mean little metaphorically. I mean physically little, youre a very small man.  Although it fits metaphorically too.


Look. Laszlo.  I know that my predecessor and the candidate to my left want to continue the policies of tree coverage throughout Central Oregon.  And I think we should let the tree market decide.  If someone wants a tree, they can plant their own tree.  Why should my tax dollars be going to pay for someone else getting tree coverage?  I think we can all agree that the trees have been a disaster, at times literally.  Can you show me one dollar, one actual American dollar, that Bend has gotten from the trees? You cant.  Tree coverage is bad for the economy.  If someone wants trees, they can get trees, on their own, as an American.  But we need to end. The subsidizing. Of trees.


**Moderator** : Just... go.


**Bernie** : Pope Francis, I apologize for the remarks from the other candidate towards you. While I myself am a practicing member of the Mklushufu, I respect the Catholics, now that theyre at least trying, not to diddle minors. 


I believe Bend needs more reasonable real estate prices.  Vacation rentals are becoming a plague that is marginalizing those already struggling to get by, just renting! That isnt even talking about the difficulties, of the lower class, and even much of the middle class, in their dream. Of owning. A home.


To that end, my first action would be aimed at making real estate more affordable, for buying and renting. And it will take the help of this wonderful groundswell of supporters.  Myself, and more importantly, all of you, can come together, march to Northwest Crossing, and burn it to the ground!


**Moderator** : First, my name is Michael Thomas and I am not the leader of the Catholic faith.  Second, did you just propose burning Northwest Crossing to the ground?


**Bernie** : Yes your highness, Northwest Crossing.  And, maybe Broken Top.  Shevlin Heights....well, lets just say all of Awbrey Butte at that point...to be safe, we should burn all of northwest bend, and perhaps some parts of southwest bend, down to the very bedrock itself. That way, prices throughout the rest of  Bend would become more reasonable for those working class families that cant afford a 97703 zip code..


**Trump** : If it gets rid of trees I can support that.


**Moderator** : Well we have some agreement amongst the candidates.  Some unusual agreement, but agreement nonetheless.  Thats good.  I think.  Im going to uh, skip ahead a few questions at this point and.  Gentlemen.  Your closing statements?  Bend Trump, youre going to interru-


**Trump** : Yolanda honey, my campaign can be summed up in one word.  ARTBLIBTWTS.


**Moderator** : That isnt my name or a word.


**Trump** : Apparently our moderator is such a disaster, so terrible, he doesnt know what an acronym is. 


**Moderator** : I know what a


**Trump** : Its a way for me to make a lot of words into one word, okay? So Im telling the truth when I say its one word, do you think you can handle that?  Look, A Return To Bend Logging Is Better Than Whatever They Say. Logging is what made Bend great before, and logging is what will make Bend great again.  All of our logging jobs were shipped. Over rivers!  To places like Klamath Falls and, I dont know, places.  I will bring. Those logging jobs. Back.

**Moderator** : I believe you got your own acronym wrong. And werent you arguing against trees earlier?


**Trump** : We make the trees, but we chop the trees. We sell the trees.  Our economy will be the best its ever been.


**Moderator** : Do you understand what metaphors, allegories, or puns are?


**Trump** : Your words mean nothing to me.
 
**Moderator** : Bernie, lets hear it. 


**Bernie** : I believe my stances have been quite clear since day one that I am for the little guy, and I am against income inequality.  To that end, I believe that through research and development, engineering, computers, the internet, all of these things can be better used to develop the technology that will shrink everyone to precisely three inches tall. 


That way, we would all. Be. The little guy!


Houses could then be much, much smaller, creating a tremendous availability in real estate.  We would not need to eat as much, and food would become more affordable. The ventricles, in our lungs, would at that point be too small for us to catch the common cold or flu, providing a great relief to our healthcare system. And most importantly of all, public transportation would be free, since youd only need to find a big leaf, and float on the wind. Roughly. The direction. You hope.   To go! 


We must shrink down to 1%.

<TEXT> Jon Gruden - 

Sean what I'm gonna do here is break down the failures in that last Toyota ad.

The problems start at the top, and by that I mean the play selection by Junior Vice President of Marketing Norv Turner. Keep in mind Sean that the strength of an ad is to sell something.  And they're playing a song all about not owning! I don't know what they were thinking.

And while we're speaking about the Song, boy, I haven't seen line play this bad in years!

It starts with one line from the verse and jumps immediately to one line from the chorus  And if that's not bad enough, there's some terrible and frankly amateur line play in the middle there. And really, Toyota should take a knee here.  But trying to gain that extra yard, they force one more verse, and that's what's bringing out the boobirds.

Frankly Sean, that ad wasn't just poorly planned, but also poorly executed.

Sean McDonough - 

(Stifly and awkwardly) Thank you, Jon. </TEXT>

One tweak I would suggest, and it sounded like Zom suggested something similar -  more endurance for slower speeds, and possibly a way to stop leveling speed?  As in, maybe I would prefer a horse that's 14 speed but can travel 3k blocks before water?  Where an 18 speed horse would need water every 1.5k blocks?   Or something along those lines?  

I don't necessarily need/want the fastest possible horse.  I would gladly sacrifice some speed if I could travel further. </TEXT>

"No server events during the first month of a new rev"

Starts of revs seem to see a pickup in new users.  Shouldn't we be displaying what the server is typically like, to those people?  Not "hey here's a stupid turkey you can't attack that shoots fireballs"?  

Maybe admins can come up with some stats that show new player retention is X% higher than past revs, and I should shut up. 

But even for people who have been here for awhile, well, having these turkeys around this early into a rev, when people are trying to build towns/infrastructure?  It's pretty shitty. 

Please let the starts of revs be the typical nerd.nu Vanilla Substitute.  Add events when it's time to keep people around/draw people back.  Not at the very start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hear gambling pundits come on sports radio fairly often, so my takeaway from that line is -

2 is a weird number.  Usually you'd expect 2.5 or 3.5? So why 2? As an away?  And, as you'd put it, -8 if SD was at home.

IMO, Vegas wanted that -2 to be closer to -5.5/-6.5.  (I'm not dissing your team, just saying what I'm seeing from the weird line.)  But they knew if they actually put the line at that, 1) few people would actually put any money on it, and 2) those few who did would probably get fairly large payouts. 

So they put it at -2 in order to get the most people possible taking the Texans, while hinting that they expected the Chargers to win big. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **PRE-LAUNCH INFO**

**Portals** - We don't really care, but if you see one, go ahead and claim it, and maybe we can trade it later.  And if you want to keep it for yourself, whatever. 

**Terrain** - Really want desert.  Mesa was discussed, but that's mostly as a backup plan in case there just isn't any desert on the map, or it's too small, or already claimed, etc.  **Note:** we aren't just going to grab the first desert and start building.  We want to find the right terrain. If you find a really weird/lovely/interesting area, take some screenshots and send them to mayors.

**Town Style** - We aren't requiring specific materials.  But we want builds to be mostly light (whites/beiges), with some orange, and sprinkles of reds and darker colors. [Here are some quick and dirty examples](http://imgur.com/a/UwLgU) and [here is the town hall mostly finished kinda](http://imgur.com/a/btUCV)

**Rails** - If 40/pez/other wants to make a complex rail system station, that's fine. But it sounded like others are going to be abandoning the carbon/lite/"smart rails". I was picturing just an old fashioned carts station to the neighbor towns/nearest end+nether portals. 

___________
**POST-LAUNCH INFO**

**Location** - 2100, -1000 - It's a large hilly desert, and we found one of the few iron golem spawners (part of why we built here.)

**Priorities** 

~~**Claim fence** - We're going to do a 200 block radius around the center, square. The later town will have circular walls around the perimeter of the town, inside the claim fence, but just making a square to start.~~ 

**As Usual, NO PERSONAL BUILDS TO START** - All chests/furnaces should be placed by mayors.  Mayors can create personal chests for your personal storage. We will set up early rev storage, please wait until roads/plots are made for houses.

~~**Basic Farm** - need early rev animals/crops.  These will eventually be moved to a better location, but we're a hungryhungry town.  **Update** Tic has finished most of this.~~ Pretty much good to go. 

**Planning** - planning isn't a requirement this rev, but is of course encouraged, especially when it comes to town builds like farms/arenas/etc. Pez has created a rev19 planning space. The server again is oc.blankstare.net - you might need to do /server planning and then /mvtp plan19

**Other Stuff** - TBD

Somewhere in the map we have found and claimed an end portal.

**Rails at y12** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, it does appear I misread some things. 

First - Regardless of what # a team is picking at, it is very easy they will completely and utterly screw up that pick.  You pointed this out as well. That's a human element that I would say applies equally to any/all of the sports leagues. Goff is terrible, sure (most likely). If I was more familiar with baseball/hockey, I could probably point to similar/recent reaches by teams that failed in those sports.   

Nothing about baseball/moneyball strategy says every pick is going to be a 100% great fit and works perfectly, or the A's would be more than a footnote of a Jonah Hill movie.  

Furthermore, getting the first pick in the NFL draft, as opposed to the third, or fifth, or twelfth, honestly doesn't mean as much as having more picks in general.

It's not about the first pick necessarily.  They can trade that pick. Plenty of dumb teams will trade from #9 to #1 for someone like Goff.  The tanking isn't about #1.  It's about the accumulation.

Tanking will not happen in the NFL without a significant change in that culture, and I don't think it'll happen anytime soon.

I'm suggesting that's happening.  You have not provided evidence to the contrary.  </TEXT>

RG3 was after.  And RG3 was hired for the league **minimum.**  He paid the lowest possible amount for a player he assumed would be just okay and probably hurt eventually, which is what happened. 

Their brilliant plan for QB was to pay the **minimum amount** to an injury prone quarterback who sat on the bench for the entire last season, and that's not tanking? </TEXT>

<TEXT> But you're applying arguments that should theoretically equally apply to other sports, but saying the NFL is excluded from this.  

There are direct quotes, from some of these MLB GM's, saying they purposely will be horrible to start in order to accumulate young talent.

Single games don't matter.  It's been made clear they are, again, **purposely** tanking to get talent. You say "seem to pick off wins here and there" like they're trying.  If they are, it's the bare minimum. 

Again, the arguments against NFL teams tanking don't really hold water. MLB managers have taken positions in clubs knowing full well that the plan was to tank for 2 years.  Same with NBA head coaches.  And even ignoring other sports, look at the incredibly high rate of turnover in terms of coach/coordinator/staff positions even when those teams are *trying* to win.  "They won't tank for job security" doesn't really work out as a proper argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But what have the Browns done but fall into the same cycle every 1-3 years since being re-established? #1 on QB, new coach, new coordinators/staff, repeat. 

Would tanking on purpose with the (remote?) possibility of changing that cycle be worth it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can totally see how it will have a lot of difficulties translating to the NFL and maybe won't ever have a proper analytics model.

But I've also seen lately how a lot of the arguments about how tanking in the NFL "just won't work" break down when that model works in other sports. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Serious] With a baseball/analytics at GM, are the Browns breaking an NFL taboo and tanking on purpose, following the MLB model? And is that necessarily a bad thing if true? </TITLE>

<TEXT> **Note:**  I understand this is a very sensitive topic, hence why I tagged it as serious. I'm just asking for people to keep an open mind to generate discussion. I am not trying to troll.

Tanking in the NFL is a **very** ~~taboo~~ ~~uneasy~~ ~~awkward~~ ~~shit!~~ idea. There's no proper way to emphasize how much all of us hate the idea of it. 

The Browns have hired a GM with a background in baseball/analytics.  Tanking, in baseball, is pretty much considered super duper okay nowadays. The Cubs, A's, Indians, Royals, maybe the Mets...they've all recently taken to the idea of purposely tanking in order to accumulate young talent, with a few key free agents, to make a run of a few years.

There's even a semi-popular quote by one of those GM's (which I'm guessing people more familiar with baseball can quote better), but when he was interviewed he said his plan was "We'll be terrible for the first two years, competitive in year three, a late playoff run in year four, and a world series in year five."

MLB has openly embraced tanking in order to accumulate talent and make a run. The Browns GM is from a baseball/moneyball background.  

Browns fans.  We've just witnessed the Cubs break a 108 year drought.  And they did that by purposely tanking for a few years.  

**TL;DR**  

1) Is it possible that they're tanking on purpose, following an MLB/Cubs/A's/Indians/Royals model?  
2) If so, is it such a big deal? Can you "live with" purposely losing 2-3 seasons if it meant a Super Bowl run?  
3) Why was Kessler taken out tonight?  
4) I didn't even start on how obvious NBA tanking is...   </TEXT>

Pay attention to his mic next game in the 4th quarter.  I swear something keeps happening that just totally destroys his audio quality.

<TITLE> [Scents of the Months : Nov/Dec] Inaugural Thread - Winter Woods </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-10 01:46:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey y'all.  Doing this myself, thought others might be interested. I got tired of all of the generic male scents ("Bold Breeze" or "Fresh and Crisp" etc) so I thought I'd start buying specific scents for various products, focusing on a narrow range/complimentary scents every few months. 

If you felt like joining in, posts of what you bought/where and reviews would be great!

November/December. Fall is coming to a close, Winter is coming. A time to chop wood, sit by the fireplace, stoke a pipe.  So I'm doing woodsy/smokey smells.   

**Note: Links below are not an advertisement or endorsement. I'm not connected in any way to anyone making these products. Found them all just by googling "male (product) (smell)".** 

These are the various things I decided to go with - 

[Wild Man of the Woods Deodorant from an Etsy Dealer](https://www.etsy.com/listing/231354589/wild-man-of-the-woods-deodorant-aluminum?ga_order=most_relevant ga_search_type=all ga_view_type=gallery ga_search_query=Wild%20Man%20of%20the%20Woods%20Deodorant ref=sr_gallery_1) - "The scent is woodsy and spice with clove bud, cedarwood and sandalwood blend."

[3x samples of colognes from mefragrance.com](http://www.mefragrance.com/details.cfm?premixproductid=413 collectionid=6) - Smoke n' Oak, Cheeky Teaky, and Mood for Oud samples to see what (if any) I want to go with.

[Sandalwood and Manuka Gentle Facial Scrub from Koru Naturals](http://www.korunaturals.com/proddetail.php?prod=DCSCR)

[Crabtree   Evelyn Indian Sandalwood Hair and Body Wash from lookfantastic.com](http://www.lookfantastic.com/crabtree-evelyn-indian-sandalwood-hair-and-body-wash-300ml/10970974.html)

[Pipe Smoke Organic Body Lotion](https://www.etsy.com/listing/206938942/pipe-smoke-organic-body-lotion-aloe-shea?ga_order=most_relevant ga_search_type=all ga_view_type=gallery ga_search_query=Pipe%20Smoke%20Organic%20Body%20Lotion ref=sr_gallery_2)

[Manly Indulgence Woodland Escape scented candle](https://www.amazon.com/MANLY-INDULGENCE-Woodland-Escape-Candle/dp/B01LXD4NCL) (actually found this at a TJ Maxx for $8, was also looking for a cheap handsoap there but struckout.)

No reviews yet, since the candle is the only one I have so far (smells nice). 

Edit : ~2 weeks before Jan/Feb I'll make a new post.  Hopefully there people will post reviews of things they bought, as well as possible nominations for the next theme? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Finished building an Anet A8 and running into a problem with the X-Motor on Position/Home All </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-06 17:07:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the Y and Z motors/sensors are working beautifully, but the X is not. 

If my initial setup has the Extruder carriage pressed up against the X sensor and I do Home All, it sounds like it tries to go left for 1/2 a second (slight grinding noise against the belt), then stops and chills.

But if I, say, have the Z 1/2 way up and in the middle of the X/Y, and I run Home All, the Extruder carriage/X motor sends it all the way to the right (away from the sensor) then starts making grinding noises for a few seconds, then the Y and Z finish aligning perfectly. 

Any ideas why the Extruder assembly always wants to go **away** from the sensor instead of towards it? Is there some reverse switch I accidentally hit on the motor? 

Edit some streamables -

<TITLE> Could Elon Musk be bluffing the world into taking Mars seriously? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-04 00:19:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To start - I don't actually doubt Musk's desire to get to Mars himself. Just a thought that popped into my head.

Colonization. It was a joke in The Martian. But there is reason for governments to worry about this. Can one entity really own all of Mars? Are territories going to be a certain radius around the colony/colonies? 

Governments are going to have to start working out policies regarding this. Otherwise, a situation could develop where a corporation owns Mars. 

And if governments start working out how territories work...they're going to start wanting those territories. Maybe the Russians/Chinese send out 100 really shitty/high failure colonies as a land grab. 

While Musk's Mars Mission hasn't really been much in the mainstream or as a funny side story by some crazy billionaire. But I bet behind the scenes a lot of governments are shitting their pants. 

Even *if* Musk is bluffing, if it prompts governments to take Mars seriously, it's a great thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Title pretty much explains it all.  I like playing all modes of RL. But in order to play all modes, I have to leave at the end of each match and requeue, which means I'll probably be put in an already started match. 

I'd rather have 3-5 seconds to decide on a rematch and if I don't click rematch, then be loaded into whatever **new game**, regardless of mode, that is looking for more players.

I took all the years of the big 4 sports as a professional franchise in that city/"area" and added them together, and divided by the number of total "championships."  

It came out to something like - IF you include the AFL, then San Diego is the worst sports city, with 106 years of combined sports franchises and only one championship. If you don't include the AFL, Buffalo has one hockey championship in 104 combined years of sports I think?

<TEXT> At some point during tonight's game I thought I noticed that Gruden's mic seemed better equalized/etc, and McDonough seemed to regularly cause sound issues. After that, Gruden being wacky and all causes a fairly wide range of frequencies, which is theoretically harder to compensate for. But McDonough seemed to have the worse quality.

TL;DR - the audio quality from McDonough seemed terrible compared to Gruden.

Late edit : it seemed like McDonough's mic experienced clipping errors more often, to be more specific. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks to both of you! Yeah desert is really our primary goal.  Mesa is more a backup plan than a secondary plan. And then just plain weird terrain we may or may not be interested in.

<TITLE> [Next Rev Plans] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-23 01:59:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Portal** - We aren't going for a portal this time.  If we find one, claim it, as it may be worth trading.  But thanks to elytra/good boats/etc, it's not a primary goal.

**Terrain** - We are going for a certain type of terrain.  **Desert first, Mesa as backup.** However, we are also open to other interesting terrains.  Can't really guess what they'll generate for the next map, there may be a neat weird place that we all like. (Edit: green terrain only as a last resort really...)

**Theme** - This rev, we're going to try out a town palette.  We want builds to emphasize a very light color (tans, whites, sandstones, clays wools birch bone etc), with reds/pinks secondary (clays, wools, mushrooms?), and occasional/sparse dark bits (coal blocks, obsidian, wool, etc).

To help clarify, [here are some variations of the overall theme, including possible road designs.](http://imgur.com/a/UwLgU)  First few desert, second few mesa variants.  

**But most important of all** - there is one month until the new rev begins. So if you have any ideas/inspiration for working on road designs, or town hall designs, or farm designs, we'd love your input.  

The images above are just some rough ideas for what might look nice in desert/mesa. Input on designs/colors/etc is always welcome!

**Backup Plan** - Aw crap did we not find any desert/mesa to settle in?  Oh well, I guess we'll just have to settle for making the prettiest goddamn city on the map somewhere else.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last two Civilization games haven't been broken at launch.  But they've both definitely felt incomplete and lacking at launch. And it's obvious that their strategy is to release a base (imo, incomplete) game then release as many DLC's as possible after.

But Civ never seems to get the flak that any other game with DLC does.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That looks a bit larger than the Saturn from the series "what would the other planets look like if they were as close as the moon." [Here](https://youtu.be/usYC_Z36rHw)

I'm no mathematician, but if Saturn were closer than the moon, it would certainly fuck up our oceans. Probably at some point (relatively quickly)our orbit would decay and we'd get splattered on Saturn. I don't see how any of the inner planets would survive, either smashing thrm or screwing their orbits and flinging them out of the system. The extra gravity would probably eventually draw Jupiter closer to the inner system. Which would in turn have a slight effect on Neptune/Uranus, the loss of mass in the outer system possibly sending Pluto out of the system also. 

That's vaguely what would happen if Saturn was teleported to that orbit, at least. But you could also interpret that picture as, "there's obvious human civilization with Saturn in the background", which would mean we've ways been in orbit with Saturn (likely as its moon). Which would probably mean mercury, Venus, and probably Mars never became planets, and over a span of time we probably don't need to worry about all that outer planets stuff might happen.

Edit: Seeing from the other answers that I mostly got this right, hooray! Forgot about gravitational effects on continents tho... </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing from that article, is it mentions it's a 2.5% tax, and what I knew before is that's on gross receipts.

So I tried to imagine the "worst case" for something like Umqua. I tried to find their actual financial reports but of course those aren't easy, although I did find their "revenue" is close to $50m per year.

So then I thought, $50m revenue, let's say they only actually take in $100k as net.  Well, 2.5% of that would only be $2500. That doesn't seem like something that would make or break Umqua dairy.  </TEXT>

You mentioned it may help small businesses, which I'm for. But it's the more regional businesses I'm concerned about. Wilco etc. The ads (not that I necessarily believe them) say those are the businesses that'll probably get hurt most. And then Safeway or some other nationwide takes over. That's something I hope doesn't happen. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-10-15 04:18:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First, please no trolls. I'm looking for a reasoned response either way.

I went to the site with the summary/arguments for and against 97.

I thought it sounded pretty okay. I liked there were ways to avoid paying the tax, by doing green things or whatever . I don't recall exact numbers on how much of that stuff they'd have to do to get the break. And it closed an apparent gap, which, I'm all for (reasonable) taxes for.

But two things gave me pause.

1) Can't recall exact numbers, but I think they're trying to close a $900m gap? That's like, a lot. But...the site said the measure would generate a revenue, again don't recall, but I do remember thinking it was a *lot* bigger than the gap. Like a more reasonable tax could close the gap.

2) When it mentions companies like wilco umqua etc. I'm still pissed that Rays had to close because of Safeway. A nationwide company can more easily absorb those kinds of losses. 

But. How much of an actual hit would those companies take? I guess I'm asking would the net profit to tax ratio be that terrible for those semi-local companies? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So um there isn't really a good place to talk about this thread?  Thought I'd do a game thread for it? 


Player | Time of possession
---|---
Obama | 78%


**8:02** - Obama delivers an eloquent and well argued defense of the importance of getting out to vote.  Emphasizes that regardless of the party you choose, you should get out to vote for the one that best represents your ideals.

**8:05** - Nhawndie Shaw asks a tough question regarding the recent death of Michael Brown.

**8:11** - Obama mentions task force(s?) created to work on this. Emphasizes independent inquiries. Better education.  Emphasis on "protecting and serving."  Vote local, Obama can't get involved in every town's problem.

**8:14** - It's over.  No one cares?

<TEXT> So **if** we do a town pallete, right now it's based on the idea that we settle in desert. If we end up somewhere else, these ideas may get scrapped.  

But these two images are from a flower called a Desert Rose and they would more or less be an idea of the pallete.  [1](http://i.enkivillage.com/PQDSeHm0g9uXEpNsPhr1iQn5AjM=/800x0//images/8c168bceed35c49b4952bba2c926f57f.jpg) [2](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/6a/16/86/6a16860db685cfdaf0360bc32972d5f4.jpg)

So reds/pinks (wool (probably not as a primary material), clays, etc) and tans (sandstone, wool, clays, etc) for the primary colors, with some white/black accents. 

Again, that's only a possibility even if we settle in the desert, but we're looking for feedback. :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> What did you like? What did you hate? What would you like to see more of? What do you want to see less of? 

Note (the following is *possible* but nothing set in stone yet) 

We may be heading towards a desert, possibly mesa.  We may also be keeping an eye out for other interesting terrains in general.  

A portal isn't a primary concern, but if we find one it may be worth trading for better area later? (Portals are nice, but elytra/new boats/horses/rails make everything pretty accessible.)

There are some ideas of going back to a "town palette" - i.e. all builds ~~use~~ incorporate a certain range of blocks.

It was at about 9:45 AM in Central Oregon, the flight seemed to be heading west (possibly SF-Boise?). The turn had it heading (roughly) in the direction of Portland, Oregon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, I just turned off this episode about 20 minutes in and that'll be the end of that for me. 

This episode started with a family I know nothing about. Great? Then it cuts to someone we know...and the series's millionth flashback. Then back to normal times and then another flashback.  That's when I turned it off. 

For me, how this show was originally pitched, "before the breakout," sounded great. They gave up on that after 4 episodes and now it's just stupid people doing stupid things, with a million flashbacks to try to get you to care about them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to admit before the season, I really only knew 2 things about the Eagles - 

1) Their new head coach was the guy who "masterminded" the season of the Chiefs when no wide receivers caught a touchdown.

2) They drafted a guy from North Dakota State?

Gotta say, impressed how well groomed he looks and the play calling tonight looked pretty inventive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gonna repost a comment from the game thread just because I appreciated it so much - 

I really like the Eagles play calling to kill the clock.

They know the other D is tired and dejected. They aren't giving easy up the gut runs. They're still spreading the runs to the outside mostly, making them more tired and more dejected.

I feel like with a lot of other coaches (ahem), there would be a lot more time left on the clock right now when it was time to punt.

Edit: AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN PUNT! HOLY SHIT I LOVE THE EAGLES COACH! </TEXT>

But like, Trump winning the nomination has basically handed the presidency to Hillary on a silver platter.  Pretty much *anyone* else they nominated could have a real chance to beat her. 

If Hillary becoming president is part of some spooky big conspiracy, then Trump is equally a part of that. If not a bigger part. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Spoilers] Vigo and the ending to John Wick. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-07 08:43:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If you're reading this you know what goes down.  Puppycide, rampage of Archer proportions, culminating in Vigo getting a taste of the Wick.

Or do you?  ...know?...what goes down...?

Because it seems for the most part, all y'all think Wick killed Vigo, even if his death was maybe offscreen. To which I humbly submit; I am awesome, and you are wrong. 

Wick doesn't kill Vigo. Let's go over the FAQs! (Get it? Facts? Ah nevermind.)

1) Why wouldn't Wick go ahead and kill Vigo? 

A) It's not like he spared bullets in eye sockets or knives in tender vittles earlier. Oh, *now* the director decides to spare some red corn syrup? 

2) Uh...mercy?

B) Bitch please.

3) Well, Vigo was basically going to die right? 

C) Was he? (Why am I answering a question with a question? Ahhhh I'm doing it again!) He got the shit beat out of him and a knife in the shoulder.  Yes, big porno-shaming veins or arteries or what have you around there. But Wick seems to know what he's doing with the human anatomy and where to put sharp things into it, even moreso evidenced by purposely getting stabbed and only needing some staples and not-sugary-carbonated-liquid poured on the wound. If any melonfarmer can stab someone in the shoulder and miss the artery, it's Wick.

4) Well, Vigo says, "Be seeing you soon John," as his final words in the movie. That's kinda like a "see you in hell" kinda thing right? 

D) Or, it means they'll literally be seeing each other, as their line|s| of work will likely bring them together again. Which leads me to the **TL;DR**  (haha not) summation if you'd be so kind to ask...

5) So why doesn't Vick kill Wigo? (Kidding.  Vick killed dogs.  He's like the Russians.  He's a bad guy.)  

E) Wick has, at the very least, given Vigo a very bad case of the Mondays. Or he also like, killed his son, confidant, best bodyguard (only guy to survive 2 encounters!), and probably very seriously hampered (if not outright crippled permanently) his criminal organization. 

How does that fight start?  

"No more guns, John.  No more bullets."  And Wick tosses his gun.  We've seen before that he does indeed have a sense of honor, at least in some ways. And then Vigo is getting his ass kicked.  "What happened John? We were professionals.  Civilized."  "Do I look civilized to you?!" 

Aaaaaaand punkass Vigo draws a knife. In just a few seconds, Wick has some weird moment of clarity kinda shot and decides to let Vigo stab him in order to dislocate his elbow. 

**Real TL;DR? Maybe?** Wick had been on a rampage, yes.  But it was a rampage with rules. But he realizes, maybe he has crossed lines that he wouldn't have intended to cross. Sure, Vigo pulls a knife after convincing Wick to toss his gun - but maybe John has done some things like that along the way too ("Do I look civilized to you?!"). 

He lets himself get stabbed in order to end the fight with neither man dying. He returns to being a professional. He leaves Vigo with a wrecked empire, beaten half to death, stabbed, son killed, and sitting in the rain (and some pee).  He has beaten Vigo.  But there is no real reason to take things with Vigo personally.  Everything was his dipshit son, and him (understandably) not wanting his son to be murdered.  

__________

A loose end or two...or are they?

Sigma) Well, Vigo still looks like he's kinda dying. 

Jupiter) Yep, there's a shot where it looks like it might be his last breath. One *could* (if they didn't want to be a big dickhead) view that as a huge exhale - relief from not being killed, exhaustion, realization of everything that had happened.

Bojangles) I mean, he really looks like he's kinda dying.

) He was also walking toward his helicopter. Or something? Well it looks like cranes are in the background.  But theoretically a helicopter pilot who gets paid by this guy is in the area. If you're in a helicopter and there's a landing spot at a hospital with a helicopter pad can you just like radio in and ask to offload some dude?  I don't know, but these are the important questions. 

Wick let Vigo live. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For live sports, Sports Devil links to websites such as vipbox, roja, firstrowsports, etc.  All of those are flash-based streams.  On Windows/Mac, that's not such an issue because flash is easily installed system wide. On linux you have to tinker and run a bunch of command lines to get flash to work with separate programs like Kodi. It was a bit of effort just to get flash to work in some browsers. 

If it was a Windows system, Flash would be a system-wide service, which is why those streams work fine in Kodi/Sports Devil. In linux it is not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My googlefu has only found a single link as a way to "fix" this and it was a pretty crappy link, which TL;DR would only really work if I only use one specific URL for all sports streaming. (Doesn't really work when switching between Football games, watching Soccer matches, etc.)

So Sports Devil is kinda useless to me atm because Flash streams don't work which is pretty much all of them.

Hoping there are some linux pros on here who have figured out how to do this.  </TEXT>

It's the only reason I can think of for them being so hard nosed about this. But now it's stupid because if you wanted more cap room to get free agents, 1) they've scared a lot away because of this, and 2) it's not like there are a bunch of big names still unsigned.  </TEXT>

It isn't like when Genghis Khan died and the Mongol hordes did a 100% retreat. Think of it more like the collapse of the ussr. Sure a lot of territories were lost, but Russia remained a big bad power with many of the former apparatuses still basically in place, just rebranded. </TEXT>

It wasn't like we decided to find a 2br place together. So he payed a token amount because it's in my best interest for him to find his own place so I could live alone again, and I'd be paying that rent regardless, at least I get a months (or few weeks) worth of whiskey out of it.

<TEXT> Um, well, if I could defend myself a bit here -

I wasn't expecting payment, or a drink, or whatever. If she had said "hey let me get you a shot of whiskey!" I would have thought "awesome!"  But I wasn't expecting it. 

And my friend who is staying here, I'm "charging" him $100 a month. Long story short, he's a super awesome dude, he had to move here on very short notice bc of a job offer, and it's in my greater interest to continue living alone, so the sooner I could help him save up to find his own place, the better. 

When he sent the "she's taken off" text, I replied "Huh, not even a goodbye or a thanks."  When he came home from work that day, he brought me home 2 of my favorite Belgian ales, and I could tell that he was pretty appalled by the extended length of stay/abrupt departure. I had to reassure him that whatever I thought about her didn't reflect onto him. 

Maybe my contrast story of the other guest made you think I was expecting something? But that was a text I received at work, "hey guest2 is making a bigass meal and there'll be plenty if you want some" - awesome! She didn't make it for me, she made it for herself and my friend. But there was a lot, and I was invited, and I was thankful for that. </TEXT>

And she was no introvert. Pretty typical east coast girl who spoke her mind whenever and wherever she felt like it. It was really the lack of a goodbye or thanks that soured me. When I got the text saying "She's taken off" (while I was at home, where she had just been as well) I was just, well, shocked. 

feeling entitled to somebody's time 

If she doesn't want to hang out, she's free to do whatever. Even my friend complained about the "conversation blackhole". If she wants to just sit on her phone the whole time, sure. Just don't expect me to open my doors to her a second time.

He tells me he has a friend who's camping/travelling around the country.  She'll be in the area for awhile, and might spend a few nights here.  Sure.

It turned into 9 nights.  She left yesterday.  She didn't say bye.  Or thanks.  Didn't so much as buy me a drink any of the nights we all went out. And the majority of the time she was here, her face was buried in her phone while we were watching the Olympics in the living room.

Contrast that with another friend of his who was here for one weekend. One night she made a home cooked meal to which I was invited. She bought me a new handsoap for the bathroom after mine went kaput.  We placed quarter bets on Olympic swimming and had a lot of fun.

One of those two guests would be welcome back any time.  The other will not be allowed to return.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After about 3 months, my main thought was, "why the fuck have I been working cafe jobs for 10 years?!"  

And I could probably teach you 80% of the job in another 4-5 comments. The other 20% are the quirks, specific to your area. Like I said I don't know basements at all. If those are common in your area, your supervisor should give you an idea of how to value them. (hole in the ground = nothing, finished walls = $5/sf? insulated, full electric, nice flooring = $20/sf?  Or they'll let you know that this one neighborhood is SoDoSoPa and it's rapidly increasing in value only because of its name really.  

But yeah a really great start would to just be any time you see a flyer for a house for sale, grab it. You should have a good idea of what are the good/meh/bad neighborhoods around, compare the values of those flyers to one another. Two neighbors are for sale, but $100k apart? Why? One has hardwood flooring, central air, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, the other does not, and it's 500 sqft larger ~~smaller~~. 

Just grab flyers, they're free after all, and try to get a feel for the areas around you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Each time you start a report, you merge it with a previous report. If you merge it with a very similar place you recently appraised (same size, value, etc more or less), then yeah, it's basically just changing the specific numbers and then a few words here and there.

Sorry but kinda need to correct myself there.  Even if you merge with a recent report, you still need to do a new search for comparables, a new MCA/One Line report, a new statistic analysis...

Eventually they become relatively rote. Just felt like I was being misleading in terms of the ease of new appraisals.  If you have two nearly identical houses next door to each other selling at the same time? Sure you can probably use the same comps/mca/one line/stats, but otherwise you should really do new searches for that stuff. </TEXT>

But there is more work in terms of finding comps. One of those minor rants would be - you're required to bracket. Which means if your house is 2000 sqft, you need one bigger and one smaller. And you have to bracket *everything*. So you might find a house which is completely typical in every way except for some reason only 1 garage space. And all your comps have 2. So you need to cast a super wide net to find a kinda-similar place with 1 garage (or with central air conditioning, site size, view, etc etc.). And sometimes there just plain isn't one, and so you need to choose a really really shitty comp just because it has a 1 car garage, and you end up with 165% net and 234% gross adjustments. So even though that's a terrible, awful, horrible, disgusting clusterfuck of a comp, you *have* to use it in order to bracket the 1 car garage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I missed 2 other parts. 

I'm sure there is also more besides judging the price of the house that you need to do? That seems like it would take very little time every time.

Depends where you live. Are you in a major city with lots of suburbs? You can probably do the jobs a lot more quickly. Where I live is some weird mix of like 1/5 golf resorts, 1/5 houses from the 1920s, 1/5 super new trendy, 1/5 typical suburbs, and 1/5 semi-rural. Some are a lot faster/easier, others more difficult. But, yes, last week I had 3 jobs that I finished in 3 days. If I wasn't still fee splitting, that's $1800 in 3 days.  With the cherry on top of a 4 day weekend, since I thought I'd need Monday/Tuesday. (If money was my main priority, I could have taken on a tougher job/higher fee and worked those 4 days.)

Skills - ummm...be kinda okay at math, you don't need to know anything beyond like algebra. But if you can kinda look at a comp and think "it's 300 sqft larger, I'll probably adjust by $50/sf, so that's a $15,000 difference" (note: I used a calculator for that, even though that should be easy :P ). 

Deductive logic? Basically, comparables should end up comparing. It's 300 sqft bigger, so now it's $15,000 too low. But, it doesn't have a mountain view. So, it would seem that a mountain view is roughly $15,000 in value, because that would make the subject/comp closer to being equal. Once you make adjustments, they should be a good idea of the value of the subject. If something is out of whack, there is a reason for that. ("Ohhhh, this comp was downslope of the house behind is, so their neighbors behind them are basically staring down at them into their house/back yard. That's a shitty lack of privacy, so maybe a 5% adjustment to location?  Hey, that 5% adjustment ends up making that comp a lot closer to the other comps. That explains it!") </TEXT>

<TEXT> Still some time before track   field starts, no problem ;)

Okay, [here](http://www.goodfaithappraisals.net/xSites/Appraisers/GoodFaithAppraisals2/Content/UploadedFiles/Appraisal-1004-Sample2.png) is one of the pages of forms you fill out, this one specifically about comparing the subject and comps.  Far left is the subject, comparables the next 3. A lot will look like gibberish. 

For instance view is N;Res; - neutral, residential. If a mountain view, B;Mtn; (beneficial) or A;Factory; (adverse). This can also apply to location (B;Resort; or A;BsyRd;).

So top to bottom mostly self explanatory up til Site adjustment. It seems like the subject was located in a semi-rural area where a larger site isn't *that* important. In a tightly packed suburban neighborhood, those adjustments would probably be bigger. Looks like he gave it around $0.75 per square foot difference. 

The age adjustments he did...in an interesting (pretty shitty) way. It should be a certain % multiplied by the square footage (and rounded, usually nearest $500). He just did a flat rate.  Oh well.

The 1 year olds are given C1 condition since they were just built, subject is C3, it's been lived in awhile. This can be somewhat subjective and it's good background data to get if you say, see a neighbor got their house painted. So the appraiser probably thought, "if we installed new flooring, maybe new counters in kitchens and bathrooms, fresh coat of paint, that's worth $20k."

He didn't adjust for the number of bedrooms which is kinda odd. (That adjustment would go to the right of "Total|Bdrms|Baths".)  Bath adjustment below that, he decided a 1/2 bath is worth $2000. (Also it's 2.1 as in 2 full, 1 1/2.  If it was 3 full and 2 1/2 baths, it would be 3.2.)

Square foot adjustment, he did by $20/sf.  That seems a bit low. The way I've been trained is 40% of replacement cost, which is from something called cost approach which isn't worth going into here.

Basements I pretty much never deal with where I live. I don't really know valuation methods for that. 

I guess subject had a small porch and deck and he decided that was $5,500. These can also be kinda subjective. Maybe a house has a 10'x20' covered porch, but it's concrete, versus a 8'x12' nicely stained wood deck with no roof/cover? Some people might prefer the first, some might prefer the second. So I wouldn't adjust for those. But comps 1 and 3 straight up had none at all, so an adjustment is made. 

The porch/patio/deck is the last of the ones you *need* to fill out and you have the 3 lines below to add other things.  He added fireplaces, which is odd for where I live, but this is Minnesota, so I guess that's worth an adjustment. 

Fence/shed/other I often do ("Outbuildings") when working on the next town to the south of me, because detached large shops are popular down there.

Okay, the next row of significance is the net adjustment total with the X boxes. He did something kinda bad here; typically in your first 3 comps you want at least one positive adjustment or one negative adjustment; he has only negative adjustments. But again, rural area, it might not have been possible.  

Next are net and gross adjustment %'s. This is usually what tells you what your best comps are. Comp 2 has a 1.1% net and 8.9% gross, the lowest in both. That's the strongest comp. Comp 3 is 6.6/12.0, probably second strongest. Comp 1 is 8.7/11.9, probably weakest. So, the value of the subject should probably fall between Comps 2 and 3, but with a little pull closer to 2 from comp 1. $295k sounds like a good conclusion. 

Some of this could have made me go on some minor rants about the bureaucratic crap I mentioned in the cons. But track   field is starting.  Maybe later :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I can't speak nationwide about competitiveness.  But right now we're turning down around a dozen jobs per week because we're pretty much booked through September.  And along those lines, when I started about a year and a half ago, the standard fees were around $350-450.  My supervisor told me that's basically the fees they'd been getting since they started 20 years ago.  In the past 4 months, our standard fees have gone up to $600-800. In one particular job, was doing a refinance on a house owned by a realtor. And she was curious about wtf was going on, because she had a house "sold" except it would take 2 months to get an appraisal done on it, and the deal couldn't close until that was done. 

So at least where I live, it seems like the well of appraisers is definitely drying up pretty quickly. As for others being clued into it, see my parent comment.  I never see this job come up in any sort of list of jobs people should look into.  

I kind of think there'll probably be a crisis soon, which might lead to easing trainee requirements.  As my supervisor told me, "How I was trained to be an appraiser? I got hired by a bank and started doing appraisals." 

And one piece of advice I was told when I started was, "Always put a bit aside in a savings account, because you never know when the slow times will come, but they will come."  </TEXT>

This is one con I left out mostly because it's a bandaid effect. The classes (can all be done online) are dry as fuck. I had to answer questions in a test about how many chains make a mete, and how many metes make a bound. Like, 17th century measurements I have never once used in work so far.

<TEXT> It's not glamorous, but pays pretty fucking well. 

Basic rundown - someone needs a loan for their house (purchase, or refinance, sometimes foreclosures) - the bank wants to know, "You're buying this house for $300k?  What is it actually worth?" so they know how much to loan out. So they hire us to go check things out, we look up similar houses, we compare the subject with the comparable houses (1 car garage instead of 2 car? mountain views or not? next to a factory or in the suburbs?) - apply values to the differences, and that (should) give you a good idea of the value of the house.

Pros - 
1) About 95% of the job can be done in your underwear. Very little interaction with humans.  But you do deal with homeowners, and sometimes meet some neat characters, and (rarely) some jerks.  
2) Jobs have a due date.  As long as you turn in the job by that date, it doesn't matter when you work on it (mostly).  So when you're filling out the report, you can do that 9-5, or 7-3, or 2am-8am.  
2b) This also leads to a lot of random three day weekends (or longer).  A job normally takes about 2 days. Sign up for 3 jobs per week thinking I'll turn them in Tuesday, Thursday, Monday. Turns out all 3 jobs were super easy and only took 1 day each.  Suprise! You now have Thursday and Friday off!   
3) There are official go to work for a bank appraiser jobs with normal hours and whatnot. Independent, you throw out bids for jobs. The advantage of this is if you want to take a week off? Just don't bid on jobs that week then.  Have a happy vacation!  
4) Currently, and this was confirmed when talking to some reps from US Bank, the vast majority of appraisers are basically in their 60s.  They'll be retiring soon. There aren't many young people going into this profession.  Fewer people doing it = higher fees per job in the near future.

Cons - 
1) You have to be a trainee for 2 years. So you need to find an appraiser who will be your supervisor. A good one, who gives you at minimum 50% of the job's fee.  Some will sit back, do nothing but put their signatures on the report, and try to take a majority of the fee.  
2) There is some amount of bureaucratic bullshit. For the most part it's background noise you get used to.  For instance, a report I recently had to revise - there is a freaking checkbox for a line "Are there any adverse conditions that might effect value? []yes []no" - I checked no. The report was returned, and I had to actually write down elsewhere "There are no adverse conditions that might effect value" even though there's a *freaking checkbox* for that.  
3) It varies with the market.  Right now, in most places, the markets are bouncing back from the recession.  But if another recession hits? Real estate takes a big hit, so your job takes a big hit (and this is when you're more likely to do foreclosure jobs, which are always kinda sad to do).

But overall, you can easily earn $50k per year, plus or minus $20k depending on how hard you want to work/how good of clients you can find. You can work from home if you want, or find an official job at a bank if you want. If you work from home, there's no "ladder" to climb so you'll just be doing jobs forever.  But you can also take classes to become a commercial or industrial appraiser which pays a lot more. 

I pretty much tell every friend who complains about their job to look into doing this. </TEXT>

But after that I saw the Japanese/Korean leagues definitely invested in their youth programs. There were so many "great-one-touches-per-game" more than a US match.

I probably overlooked the 2002 squads, but I'm always suspicious of host nations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's Chelsea vs AC Milan, two pretty good teams.  But, this is kind of the equivalent of preseason for them.  It's better than the NFL preseason, the typical stars/starters will play a number of minutes similar to what they'd play during the regular season, but they're only playing maybe 80% speed? 

I was planning on watching this anyway, but getting some nice live looks at the new stadium in action is a sweet bonus.  

It's on ESPN2   3, frequently you can stream ESPN2 for free with a cable subscription login.  Or you can find it in the soccer variation of where you'd find NFL streams.

(Also, Chargers fan here, just thought you guys would wanna know.)

Edit: Looks like pretty much every stream is reliant on ESPN and they've still got 10 minutes in the Bayern/RM match. </TEXT>

He dies surrounded by others in a static position.  Wade (medic) is introduced surrounded by other medics, not caring the least for his own safety.  He dies with no medics around, crying for his mom.  Mellish cries over a Nazi-youth knife at the start; dies by one in the end.  Miller is shown utterly shell-shocked and looking horrified; dies after coming out of shell-shock, and totally gleeful (even while dying).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So a friend of mine has [this shirt, which has dark brown lining under the cuffs](http://imgur.com/a/ntWkx).  We were trying to think of a way to roll the sleeves so that he could have the dark brown exposed when/if he rolls up his sleeves further up his arm, like up past the elbow. 

All we could really come up with is bunching up the shirt, but that looks pretty sloppy.  And all of the conventional ways to roll up a sleeve would end up hiding the dark brown part. 

So, any creative ways to keep the brown exposed while making a crisp/clean sleeve roll? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rev18 Plans! (Sorry for the late info) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-26 18:08:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey Rosarians! Rev18 is coming, so here are some of the plans we've discussed.

**Biggest Changes**

1) We won't be requiring builds on the planning server first next rev, except for large-scale things like farms/townhall/etc.

2) Speaking of townhall - design for the townhall is open for anyone to give a go at. Whether you're new to Rose or an old hat, if you think you can make a nice townhall build, head on over to planning and give it a go! (Note: townhall should include both storage as well as room for rail stations.  Possibly incorporate a water elevator/ladder/something to get to sky limit for flying.) 

**Other Changes**

1) No terraforming.  We're building with the land again.  Edit: If you want to terraform your own plot you're welcome to.

2) The general theme is modern, eco-friendly. However, it's likely we'll have an "olde time" district for those who like building in that style.  

3) Similar to the past, the first few days of the rev will be **no personal builds** until we get the town center and some roads marked out.  Mayors will set up chests the first few days for storing your personal goodies. 

4) **Portals!** We will be hunting for a portal again.  This includes end portals, but preferably Nether portals.  We'll be striking South primarily at the start of rev.  If everything fails and we can't find a portal, then 0,1000 will be the location of Rose.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rocket League on PC here, using a Steam Controller.  About 50% of the times I launch the game, my bindings are completely screwed up.  When I look at the options, all of the buttons look how they should.  But when I click, B for instance (which is what my boost should be), it instead brings up an option to leave the match/etc.  My right trigger, normally just "go forward" is instead boost.

And, again, if I go to the control settings in game, my controls appear there correctly.  But in game, they don't.  

Sometimes I have to restart Steam entirely just to get my settings to bind.  

But again about 50% of the time I launch the game, my controller bindings are for some reason completely off, even though in the options menu they all look correct.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Fans of Neal Stephenson - what the hell was up with Seveneves? Why did it seem so off? (Spoilers I suppose?) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-19 04:15:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just finished reading it for a second time.  I've read most of his novels multiple times, but this second read was more along the lines of, "maybe I missed something the first time...?"

But it was still mostly disappointing.  In past novels he tended to teach the reader something while doing so in a very entertaining way.  The action tended to be a slow build towards a big payoff, or possibly slow/big/slow/big.  

But Seveneves, when it came to the "teaching" elements, was just dry and boring.  Especially if you'd already read Anathem, the enormous amount of time spent explaining Delta Vee's was just tedious.  There were none of the humorous elements that might make them interesting.  

The "action" parts were just plain stale.  The build up to Cleft was kind of intense...in parts...when it didn't divulge into yet another science lecture about Delta Vee's that took up most of a chapter.  Edit: Also I can't recall a single other of his novels that made such a blatant, obvious plot point as "the gun was missing from the holster" and the former president using it to such terrible effect later.  When I first read the gun was missing from the holster I immediately thought, "Well that will come up again later to a shitty ending," and sure enough it did.  I don't recall any other examples of Stephenson doing such a shitty job of foreshadowing.

And the ending felt so very rushed.  Like his publisher put a page limit on the book so he had to hurry it.  The first time I read the book was as an eBook, and so it's a little harder to keep track of the page count/how far into the book you are.  "EPILOGUE" suddenly appeared on my screen and I was in shock.  I just could not believe that was really how that entire build up ended in a very short time.  

I have friends and family who also love Stephenson.  When they asked my opinion about Seveneves, all I could tell them was, "It was good, I guess.  But it wasn't a Neal Stephenson book."

Any theories about this, or explanations of why I didn't get it are appreciated.  Because I feel like maybe I'm missing something?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just randomed Elder Titan.  Again.  I checked my dotabuff stats.  Out of my 13 games playing Elder Titan, 7 are from All Random.  3 of the games are All Pick, and I am 100% certain that each of those 3 times were choosing random, because I fucking hate Elder Titan and would never choose him purposely. (The rest are Single Draft, where I probably picked him just because AR made me "familiar" with him.) 

That brings the total to 10/13 randoms.  

I have randomed Invoker once.  Earth Spirit twice.  TA twice.  Wyvern once.  Tusk twice.  (I'm going backwards from my least played heroes.)  Chen twice, Morph 4x, Lycan 3 times...

It's become something of a joke with the people I play with.  "Oh you played all random last night? So how did you like Elder Titan?"  

Anyway, just wondering if other frequent AR players have similar experiences. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for low-ish cost, low maintenance, to cover a pretty large area. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-27 04:19:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I live in a duplex, with my friend living next door.  Rent is pretty low here, but part of the reason for that is we're supposed to keep the "yards" weed free.  So every late Spring/Summer, we have to go out and do a lot of work removing all the weeds.  

[Here are two pictures of the total area we need to cover](http://imgur.com/a/zwpgT)

So I'm wondering if there are attractive, low maintenance (there are no sprinklers, and the goal is to reduce the work needed) ways to fill in these areas to prevent future weed growth/removal.  

We're not against some amount of work setting it up, like doing some gravel areas or something.  But preferably it would be some sort of low, attractive ground cover plant.

Notes about conditions/weather - This is in Central Oregon.  It's a "high desert."  So it's pretty arid, with snows/freezing temperatures in the winter.  It's typically sunny, I think we average something like 300 days of sun per year.  And as you may or may not be able to tell from the pictures, shade is fairly minimal.  (More shade in the second picture, not so much in the first.)

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

Maybe there's someone I'm not thinking of atm, but it seems like Kunkka is the *only* hero that has an obvious way to tell if a skill is off of cooldown or not.  And to me that seems similar to the manapool debate - it gives the enemy way too much information way too easily.  

There are a lot of abilities which have special animations *when they're active.*  But to me it seems like an animation of when it's active versus when it's off cooldown is a big difference.  I can think of a lot of skills where, if there was an obvious animation telling you if it's on cooldown or not, would change how you play. 

Imagine if Juggernaut had, say, glowing boots when his spin was available.  Wouldn't that change how you played against him?  

Edit: Jakiro and Bounty Hunter also apparently have these tells.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> YSK in Oregon (and possibly other states) there is a way to be reimbursed from the state for random crimes/damages. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-12 03:13:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> About 10 years ago, a friend was letting me short-term borrow his car, as I had just moved back to the US.  Halloween came along and on November 1, I woke up to find that someone had thrown a pumpkin through the windshield of my/his car.  

This was obviously not a crime that had a chance of being solved.  My friend whose car it was?  He was a lawyer.  He told me, hey just go down to the courthouse, ask for these forms, they'll reimburse the cost of a new windshield.  

Lo and behold, it worked.  It took awhile, I think they wanted to give some window of time to attempt to catch the perpetrator?  But a few months later, I was compensated for the cost of replacing the windshield.  

[This is the Oregon-specific link](http://www.doj.state.or.us/victims/compensation.shtml) which mostly just lists *very* serious crimes.  But, at least in my one experience, they also support small-scale, non-violent crimes.  (And the way my friend so casually suggested I do that, it seems like he thought it wouldn't be a problem, so probably applies to other similar petty crimes.)

Edit: Oh a few other important points, possibly/probably also Oregon-specific : 

1) You had to have a police report.  I called the cops, they came and checked it out, I had a report.  You can't just fill out the forms for some theft that wasn't investigated.  

2) You had to file your claim within a certain amount of time, I believe 3 months was the window? So you couldn't fill out the forms, "yeah my bike was stolen last year..."

3) As hinted at but I didn't clearly state - you needed a receipt/some other form of proof of cost of reimbursement.  I paid out of pocket for the repair, included the receipt, was reimbursed.  So, unfortunately, if a particular object was a cheap item with high sentimental value, that won't come into play; just the cost to repair/replace. (note:this may vary depending on the seriousness of the crime; this was only my experience with such a cheap/petty crime.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been signed up with Project Fi for 4 months, and already on two separate occasions I've had to have 1+ hour discussions with customer service to get them resolved

First time - I signed up with a certain debit card, which I also set as my auto-payment card.  Month 2 - Payment declined.  What?  After 45+ mins on the phone, finally figured out that for, whatever reason, they were using credit card details from 5+ years ago, from a card that's been inactive about since then.

Why? Why use a card that I didn't use to sign up, and a card I didn't set up for autopayment?

Tonight - two different 45 min calls.  Received notification my payment didn't go through.  I'd recently moved, updated my payment address - but, didn't go through.  45 mins on the phone, "sorry I can't help you, can you wait for a supervisor?" "can they call me back?" "sure!" ~10mins later receive a call back, I hear literally nothing but "boop boop (insert random computer noises here)" for 5 mins before hanging up.  

Now on the phone for another 30 mins.  Person just transferred me to yet another wait signal.

___

Finally got it resolved. Total call times (just tonight) - 49 mins, 47 mins, 44 mins, 14 mins.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every 6 months or so I house-sit for my parents and take care of their dog while they go on vacation, and those are the only times I have to deal with cable tv. 

My job involves weird hours. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. During the day, nothing is on, ever. Price is Right is cool I guess, and then nada.  Then maybe at 6-7 PM something good comes on.  Sometimes. And after 9 PM, nothing again.

I'm currently watching Daredevil season 2 premiere because, at 11 pm on a Friday night, with ~600 channels, there is nothing at all worth watching. 

The current "let's cram everything into a 7-9 PM timeslot on certain weekdays" pretty much just encourages everyone to DVR those shows and save them for a more convenient time - allowing them to skip ads and reduce revenue. 

If there was something, **anything** on TV right now I'd be watching it, and its ads, and generating revenue. But there's nothing, and I'm watching Netflix instead. The number of times this comes up when I'm reduced to cable tv is ridiculous.  </TEXT>

I just repotted it, with some gravel at the bottom to help drainage, the pot has a proper hole in the bottom for excess water.  But, I was lacking decent new soil and had to re-use a lot of the original over-saturated soil.  

Is there a good way to dry out this soil?  I even put a lot of paper towels on top to try to dry it out.  And it's sitting by my heater.  

If I place it in the oven at the lowest setting (200 F) for awhile to help dry the soil, will that help? Maybe if I leave the oven door open and the cactus sitting on the door?   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rewatching Ep1, thought something was worth pointing out - The name of the Alliance Cruiser they run into is the I.A.V "Dortmunder" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-11 08:52:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Why I think this is worth pointing out...

There is a long series of novels by Donald E Westlake, where the main character is named John Dortmunder. Why I think that *maybe* the name of this cruiser is related - 

1) Kinda a weird name to randomly choose.  Google "dortmunder" and mostly you get weird import/export businesses or foreign beer companies.  

2) But, if you've read the Dortmunder series, you might recognize the main character is very similar to Mal. He's a robber by trade, and frequently finds himself in a unique position to steal something valuable.  BUT, he is very much a "violence as a last resort" kind of person, and always basically kinda broke despite his last job.  And his plan often looks like it's failing, but works out in the end.  

If you read some of the Dortmunder novels, you'd probably see how my explanation doesn't do justice.  Mal is basically a futuristic-version of Dortmunder.  

I'm convinced that naming the ship "Dortmunder" wasn't an accident/random thing.  And these novels, while they're no War   Peace or whatever, are still entertaining "popcorn" novels - you don't need to think too much, they're page turners, but still keeps you interested.

If anyone here has read any of the Dortmunder novels...am I right in thinking this?  And for the people who have not read any of the Dortmunder novels, if you're looking for a quick/easy/entertaining read, check them out! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Supports get no love really.  Everyone likes to say in chat/comments how supports are great, but in-game, it's all about the carry.

When you look at the official stats of a user, it's gpm, xpm, last hits, aegis's, triple kills, etc...all stuff that favors the carry players. 

If we want support for our supports, why not show some other stats?  Wards per minute would be much higher valued than total wards placed, for instance.  (Since some people can play "support", buy all the wards possible in the last few minutes, and come out with a good "wards placed average.") Enemy wards destroyed, also good.  Tangoes/pots/clarities used on other people, also good. Total mana refreshed (through mana boots), total hp refreshed (through spells/mek), also good.

Why no public/visible stats for things like that?

<TITLE> Rose City movie night </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-02 06:10:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since pez is such a big lazy jerk and hasn't posted yet, I will!

We had our first Rose City movie night on Sunday, yay!  But it wasn't exactly advertised very well and was at a semi-inconvenient time, boo!

So this is the post for the second movie night.  What I suggest is the following - 

Make a comment below suggesting 3 movies - 

1) Give each movie a (say) 3 word description of it, and the IMDB rating.  Just naming random movies off the top of my head, something like - 

Cube - Scifi/Suspense/Indie [7.3]  
Saving Private Ryan - Action/Gritty/Big Budget [8.6]  
Brain Donors - Wacky/Comedy/Inane [7.1]  

And if there's a particular movie you feel strongly about, go ahead and say why you think it would be good!

2) *Maybe* stay away from big-budget popular movies since it's likely we've all watched them a lot/recently?  You know...no Jurassic Park or Jurassic World.  But then again, maybe we all watched Jurassic World when it first hit theaters and it might be worth watching again as a group?  So not set in stone.

3) Also, changing the movie night time to Saturday.  What time Saturday would be good to determine, since we have a lot of timezones to cover.  It seems like Zomise is the furthest-outlying timezone, so Zom what time would be best for starting a movie for you on a Saturday night? (My guess is, at the latest starting point, 6 pm eastern?  Which would be 1 am Helsinki time?)

Finally, this sub is part of the big mcpublic multi reddit thread thing, and other non-rose people might see this.  If you guys felt like joining in, feel free to do so! </TEXT>

<TITLE> If you want a series of novels (very) similar to the expanse - The Agent Cormac series by Neal Asher </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-25 03:22:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This was inspired by a reply in another thread.  [Here is Neal Asher's wikipedia with a list of the Agent Cormac novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Asher)

The Agent Cormac series is **very** similar to The Expanse.  To the point where I thought James SA Corey was a pseudonym for Neal Asher. I finished the Agent Cormac series in 2008, so when I found The Expanse I immediately fell in love with it because I loved Cormac so much. 

They are very action/military oriented.  They're set a bit further in the future, where travelling between solar systems is a thing. And all the tech that implies.  

They aren't incredibly deep, I refer to this kind of writing as "popcorn novels" - something you don't have to think **too** much about, but definite page turners.  


____________

If you're curious about Neal Asher and want to know about his other series, I've also read the Spatterjay series which is also a pretty similar writing style to the Expanse. And I started on The Owner Trilogy but didn't get very far, because at that point I'd binged on like 6 books in a row and needed a break.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off - I use weird, non-standard keybindings. It was how I first set up DotA when I first started playing a decade ago, and it's way too late to change now. 

My keybindings for my item use are - space/w/e/r/t/y.  So column 1, row 2 is bound to R. 

In 3rd party voice clients (mumble, team speak, etc) I use V as my push to talk key. 

For some reason, pushing V (to push to talk in mumble) activates my R item. 

I've tried unbinding that key, changing the binding then changing it back, nothing seems to fix this issue. 

[Screenshots of my weird keybinding setup / proof that no V keybinding exists](http://imgur.com/a/BypUp)

It's been incredibly annoying that I constantly have to make sure a passive item remains in that item slot so I don't accidentally use it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I brought this idea up a few revs ago.  After a few private conversations with certain members...we apparently have a LOT of talent in Rose.  I don't want to doxx, so I'll just say the following - 

1 of us is about to release an album with the backing of a label.

1 of us has a band that is **very** well produced from what I've heard on soundcloud.

1 of us is forming a startup/web2.0 company specifically trying to find those kinds of people. 

1 of us has spent a lot of time producing music on their own.

Actually, check that, 2-3 (or 4 or 5 or 6) of us have done that?

I don't mean we have to take the time/effort to press CD's or whatever.  I'm really talking mostly about a nerd.nu effort.  

But hey why not? From all the private message conversations and whatnot, we seem to have a very talented group of folks here.  

Let's create a soundcloud group and "release an album" that way? Just seems like a fun diversion. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rev 17 Day 3 Info Post </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-10 16:11:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We've found a lovely place to settle, huzzah!

So plans going forward - 

1) We have 3 (kinda 4) unique biomes. Spruce/taiga, extreme mountain, dark oak forest, and a wee bit of swamp. When we start developing the city, each of these biomes should have a semi-unique style and use the materials native to that region. Spruce taiga uses spruce, dark oak uses dark oak, swamp could use normal oak OR acacia.  The mountains are a bit tricky in this regard. It could be neat if people living there carved into the mountain and lived inside it, trying to leave as much of the natural mountain exterior intact as possible. (This of course leads to issues of how large an area in the mountain you can take up. We'll pretty much leave this to your discretion, just try not to claim the whole thing :P )  And adding fortress-like developments on top of the mountain works as well.

2) Town builds - We obviously need a lot of these things soon.  Proper veggie farms, animal storage, stables for horses.  If someone has a good understanding of how the new iron golem spawner system works and a good design, an iron farm would be good too. And of course all the other fun stuff like spleef, pvp arenas, etc. **Please work on these on the planning server first.  If you don't have planning server info, ask a mayor for the info, since they also have to whitelist you.**

3) We like a lot of the topography of this area and would like to keep as much intact as possible. Keep this in mind when planning any town builds. If you need help, a mayor (or other players) could help copy the terrain to planning so your build can work with the terrain better. We're not saying it has to be 100% kept natural, just keep a light touch. 

If you have further suggestions about, well, anything, leave a comment below :D </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rev17 - Last info post before the new rev. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-08 20:42:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1) We aren't really going to be portal hunting. If we find one, neat. But we're looking primarily for biomes we like.  Specifically, we're kind of hoping to build on a border of 3 biomes. For instance [this spot on the current map which is a combination of plains, snow, and jungle](http://nerd.nu/maps/pve/live/?worldname=world mapname=flat zoom=4 x=-523 y=64 z=1783) - but probably/hopefully more like savannah/mesa/plains (mesa would be great for clay/sand needs early rev). 

2) I guess we're going South again? We haven't really discussed it that much. I'd be fine with going a different direction (North is already "claimed" by a few towns). But if we felt like going West or Southwest or something, I'm fine with that personally.

3) Planning server, people! If you have the server info, /mvtp plan17 to warp to rev17 planning. 

4) We are doing a combination of megabuild, while also having a more conventional city on the ground. The megabuild is going to be a very large spiral with central tower, with houses "hanging" off of the spiral.  On planning, you can see ideas at 2000,2000. 

The road designs on the ground are located at -50,50.

See you all later today hopefully! (Assuming I can get my computer working again...)

Edit: Some additional info - 

Examples of the megabuild.  [Here is the spiral in an 80% completed state](http://i.imgur.com/QAWwUv2.jpg)

An example of 1 type of house that can be built on it - [Embedded into the spiral and hanging out](http://i.imgur.com/KFlfEG3.jpg) - if doing this style it will be encouraged to develop the bottom of the spiral [in an organic kind of way like this](http://i.imgur.com/zXX137S.png).  
There is also the option to build a road to a [floating island](http://i.imgur.com/nPTpIgh.png) house, which you could also embellish with [more small floating islands nearby](http://i.imgur.com/ogizW3G.png).

Also part of why we want multiple biomes is so that the town on the ground can have multiple themes. So pretend we have mesa, plains, and mountains.  The plains part of the town might be where people who want to build in a Hobbit-y style can build, the mountains would be where people who want to build old medieval style can build, and the mesa can be modern style builds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I finished the game, I felt very...incomplete. I hadn't found all the kindergartners, I hadn't found all the chinpokomon, I hadn't made friends with everyone in town.  

When I play "semi-open" world games like this (Skyrim etc) I tend to basically do any quest that's nearby regardless of whether it follows the main quest or not. And I try to level up every single thing before completing.

I finished the game with still a lot of level ups remaining on my character, tons of money, etc etc. 

While I found the game entertaining one go around, it wasn't really fun enough to do multiple go-throughs. I could see most of it was predetermined regardless of how you leveled, what clan you joined, and so on.

Then I saw things like the crabpeople levels were removed, also vampire kids, also hippy fights.  

If the main storyline had a little more variation, if some of those missing levels were added, if it was a little harder to reach the end.  I would gladly pay again for those features, and play through the game again. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In the 10+ years of stadium fuckery, why hasn't this idea been pushed by public/media - convince the Spanos family to sell 50% of the team. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-05 08:54:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, I can agree the notion seems silly on its face. Here's why I think it's a decent notion.

1) According to Forbes, the Spanos family is worth [$1.69 billion](http://www.forbes.com/profile/alexander-spanos/) of which [$1.525 billion](http://www.forbes.com/teams/san-diego-chargers/) is from the Chargers.  90% of their valuation is due to the Chargers alone.

2) Sell 50% of the team. Suddenly, the Spanos family has ~$750mil in liquid assets that they can invest in other things, that would potentially earn them much more money over the long term than a 100% ownership of a franchise. Hell, even throwing that in a basic money market fund would probably earn them more per year than having a 100% ownership of the Chargers returns. (Edit: I know this makes it sound like "well then why would someone buy half the team"; NFL ownership is an exclusive "club" and with a new stadium and decent marketing/concessions/etc, returns on investment could be much higher than at Quallcom.)

3) The NFL is an obvious "we want to get into that club" business.  Selling 50% of the team would likely attract a large variety of investors. 

4) The main reason the Spanos family can't personally fund a new stadium in SD is largely because 90% of their worth is tied to the Chargers. If they want to build a $1.5bn stadium, they'd have to sell 100% of the Chargers in order to build a stadium for the Chargers. That obviously doesn't work.

**Pros** - The Spanos family has liquidity to invest in other areas; they get a potential owner who could (primarily, with some city money) self-finance a stadium; the Chargers stay in San Diego.

**Cons** - They lose some control over operations; ego.

<TITLE> Rose City Rev17 plans/ideas/etc. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-22 09:35:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The mayors recently had a meeting, and we tossed around some ideas for next rev. There's nothing concrete yet, and of course we'd like your feedback! Below are the ideas that came up during that meeting. I'll post other ideas (my own or other mayors') that came up after that meeting as a comment(s) below.
___________
1) Going for a specific biome as opposed to portal hunting.  
1a) Ocean -  
Pros -  
* Variation in building (can build underwater, at surface, in the sky)  
*  More space (it's unlikely we'd have people building *right* at our border as usual), which also means we don't need to worry as much about initially claiming an area, and also room to expand later  
Cons  
* At least at the start, more difficult to build things (dirt towers from ocean floor to surface, or surface to sky, or building underwater)  
*  Early-rev travel difficulties (if no ocean portal) - boats are glitchy, swimming long distances, (early-mid) no horses until bridge(s) are made

1b) Dark forest was also brought up. 
_________________
2) Not pre-planning the build like we did for this rev, requiring massive teraforming to fit the build. Instead just coming up with the "ideas" for builds (roads etc) and going back to building with the terrain.
_____________
3) Early rev apartments. It seems like every rev we tell people not to build houses until we have good progress on the town layout. And every rev at least a few people set up a derp hut we have to later tear down/modreq away/etc.  So design/build apartments at the start, so people can have their personal space (and room for chests/furnaces/etc) and hopefully discourage people from derp huts.
___________

Other ideas that we didn't spend much time on, but maybe you have ideas and thoughts on them...

A) Helping to build server-wide infrastructure earlier on (such as CARBON)

B) a Rose mega-build - like a continuation of the townhomes in this rev, but where basically the whole city is a "single" build...somehow...

<TITLE> We need to make a Rose Gardens carnival event happen. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-08 05:46:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First - In order to make this happen, we could use a few more events/attractions/etc set up.  There are still open plots which could/should be filled.

Second - The event itself...basically we say "Rose Gardens events start at (time), with firework celebrations at the end."  I figure something like 3 hours between the start of the Rose Gardens opening and the fireworks? That would give people time to sample all of the events/rides/etc, and then firework finale.

The other thing is, we'd probably need a few more people to make some builds soon. Flumper could finish his dunk tank, etc...

Again, check planning, and confirm with tic/ice. If a plot is open on planning it's likely open on nerd.  So just confirm your build and make something awesome for ppl to go to! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-11-18 03:48:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> An on first-join msg that links to a post in this sub which is basically a "beginner's guide to PVE." Which includes a link to rules, a link to the livemap/carto, a link to basic commands (/dnymap show, /cmodify, /modreq water flow...)

Or maybe a command like /new which sends a link to that person for that sort of info? 

_______________________

Reasoning - 

There are a lot of signs with rules.  And signs are kinda...annoying. I'm guessing a lot of the people who will view/respond to this post are people who have played on this server a long time.

Putting yourself in the shoes of a first time player on this server, and seeing the chat from a lot of first time players on this server, the signs are mostly ignored. 

For instance, with new users, I frequently tell them "hey do /map and check the livemap link, and do /dynmap show to appear on that map" and I've seen lots of other people explain that same info.  Also lots of frequent questions/answers re:/cmodify, modreqs of various sorts, etc.  
 _____________

In summation - 

Maybe /new (or some command like that) could point users towards a very simplified version of common/helpful links/commands, with other helpful links included.

_____________

Example post of what /new would link to (a "permanent" post here) - 

_______________

Welcome to PVE! The following links are handy for new users to this server - 

1) Rules (no link on the sidebar apparently? But this should link to that theoretically.)

2) Livemap (link to info about the link for the livemap and how to appear/hide on it)

3) cmodify (link to info about common cmodify commands)

4) rg (link to info about region commands; how to add/remove owners/members, finding info about other towns, etc)

5) Clanchat (link to info about finding public clanchats, creating your own clanchat, etc)

6) Other (link to info about custom/etc mods like dopples, hgps, things of that nature.)

So this first post is just brainstorming ideas. Throw out what you think might be a good giant project for people to work on. Next post (say in a week) will be maybe taking the top 3 ideas and fleshing out the details more, and seeing which of those ends up as the best/most popular idea for a giant collaboration. 

So let's see some ideas for what you think might be a good giant project! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Primary concern - a small case that still handles decent gaming specs. ~$1,000 to start, with upgrades later. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-03 00:12:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

So I'm looking for a pretty good gaming PC that I'll likely upgrade over the coming months. One of my primary considerations is a smaller sized case. 

I'm not a big gamer in that I don't play a lot of games/spend a lot on steam sales/rush to buy the big new releases. Over the past ~3 years I've played Dota2 and Minecraft and very little else. And my current (not very great) rig handles both of those fine. That's why case is higher on my list of wants than specs. However, I am usually running Netflix/streaming NFL games/etc on a second monitor, so there's some fighting for resources there which I'd like lessened.

I was very attracted to [this case](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139033) but if you have other suggestions I'm open to hearing them.

Second big consideration - as stated in title, I'll probably upgrade various parts. Certain things (RAM) are easier to upgrade later than other things (motherboard), so starting out with good/very good (don't really need "excellent") things like MB, power supply, are preferred. So for instance, I only need 8 gb of RAM to start, and it doesn't have to be super amazing RAM. A good/very good SSD to start would also be nice, as I already have a 3TB/7200 rpm drive which would become my second drive. So the SSD only needs to be 128 gb, maaaybe 250gb, for OS/program files.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

Let's say the maximum maximum is $1200, though I'd prefer to come in lower than that, again, because of upgrading later. $800-$1,000 would be preferable.

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

If I get a good list of parts at $800 I'd probably be buying the parts within the next week. If it's in the $1,000-$1,200 range, the purchases would likely be spread out between now and Christmas.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Case, good+ motherboard, good+ cpu, average/good+ cooling system (fans, water cooled, or other), average/good power supply, (some) RAM, average/good SSD.

I would conder video card options, but at this point it's likely I'll keep my current card and buy one of the top of the line beauties a few months down the line.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Oregon, US. I do not believe there's a Microcenter in my town tho.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

I'll be keeping my current monitor, headset, keyboard, mouse, HDD (to be used as secondary HDD), probably video card (at work, will edit specific card when home).

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I'm interested in overclocking the CPU if it's done easily/safely. If it involves me personally changing BIOS settings that are likely to void warranty, then I'd stay away from overclocking.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Not particularly aside from, again, a small sized case that can fit all of this and not get too hot. 

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

If there's a small-sized case that features cool paint job or LED lighting, I would definitely consider that if it's not exceeding, say, $150.

**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Most likely yes, and the standard Windows 10.

**Extra info or particulars:**

That's all, thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> In 24 hours (1pm EST Sunday) Rose City will be hosting a Snowball PVP Grand Opening event! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-17 22:21:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Where** - NW Rose, -350,860

**When** - **4pm** EST Sunday, October 18 (sorry for title typo!)

**Format** 

There will be 2 phases to the event.  

**Phase 1** - *No armor or weapons.* Join one of the two sides, run around on the brick ledges, and knock people off the other side by throwing snowballs. 

When you fall to the ground, you can either run through a door, go back up, and continue firing snowballs, or, slapfight other fallen players to death.

Snow Golems are set up in each booth and shovels are provided (please return to the chest when done).

**Phase 2** - *No armor, using only weapons provided (stone swords, bows/arrows).*  This part's free for all.  

An unspecified number (currently 8) of **WITHERS!** will be released.  Stars will be dropping.  

**If you grab a star and you can exit the arena without other people killing you, you get to keep it!**

If you want to bring potions or end pearls for Phase 2, you're welcome to.  But please, again, **no armor, and using only the weapons provided.**  Want this bit to be as equal footing as possible.

So come to Rose tomorrow, throw some snowballs at pve'ers, and maybe go home with a star!

Special thanks to Zomise, Nyxie, StarMinion1, and m0rg4n4 for providing materials, helping to build, or helping to collect items.

Edit : and late thanks to ghrey/Solace for helping provide arrows. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For some reason, a few people have an issue with ingame chat with the latest update. 

For most of those people with that problem there are two solutions -

~~1) You can revert to the previous version of Rose Pack.  At the Technic launcher startup screen, click "mod options" in the upper right, and select use a specific version (0.6).~~ - sorry, I thought this was up, it isn't.

2) You can use the latest version with the following fix that mostly works - on pc, go to your /.technic/modpacks/rosepack/mods/ folder - make a new folder there /backup.  Move the file mod_watson_0.11.0_mc1.8.0.litemod into the backup folder.  Do this while minecraft is closed and try launching again. (edit: I don't know what the equivalent mac directories are, and the only other mac person I've seen with this problem, moving the watson file didn't work, so dunno about that.)

That **should** work, but if text still doesn't work - in the following suggested order, move the following mods 1 by 1 into the /backup folder and relaunch until things work right :P  -

I don't know if it's 1.8 or if something has gone awry with their moblimiter plugin or what. But the zigs are fucking crazy this rev, overworld near our portal is constantly being flooded with them, and their agro radius is insane. 

Zom and Pez remember the zigpocalypse from a week or so ago.  Well, same thing happened again last night, with Upvote and myself spending a good 20 minutes (at least) constantly running through spawn portals to despawn a never ending wave of angry zigs. It only really ended when we left to planning for 30+ mins. </TEXT>

All you have to do is link up a rail line to these parts.

I (think) I have enough blocks to finish making the CARTS section how it should look, and that will be done in the next day or two. (Sorry so much of it is over lava lakes, but that's where spawn was so *shrug*)

<TEXT> Our town is filling out quite nicely! But there are still a lot of things that we haven't built yet of various importance.  The following are off the top of my head, some we should probably build soon, some that can wait awhile.

And remember, test your design on planning first when possible! Talk to a mayor and they can set up an area for you.  Also, on the planning server, if you /tp 0 50 0 - there is a board there set up with the following (and more) ideas. But you can also post ideas here as well!

1) Tree Farm - Soon(ish) - we don't have anywhere allocated for this yet.  We were thinking it might be nice to have an "open air" tree farm this rev, but if you had a building design in mind instead, we're open to hear your ideas! 

2) Dog/Cat adoption center - no particular rush, but you can design it now and build it later or w/e - people love dogs and cats. So an area with pens where it's easy to breed new ones for new town members would be great!

3) Villager trading - same as dog/cats, no particular rush, can design whenever and build whenever - right now Solace has a lot of great villagers (as they always do), so you can do a lot of good trading there. But it would be nice if at some point we had our own villagers as well to save us the journey.  If you have experience with villager breeding setups that's a huge plus!

These are just a few ideas, it's recommended checking out the board at 0 50 0 on planning. There are ideas there that aren't here; maybe you'll post an idea here that isn't there.

And finally if someone "claims" a project, but you're interested in it too, then just leave a comment here or chat them in game and see if you can collaborate on it! More than one person working on something generally helps it go faster and be less monotonous to build. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Captain, engines are at full capacity! We need more power!

I'm trying to get Nether Spawn done as quickly as possible. But I'm also dividing time between Rose responsibilities (THE FLATTENING) and mining to make tools and get materials to finish Nether Spawn.

The reason I'm posting...pretty much every time I come back, I've found one form of grief or another.  (I haven't done any modreqs because it's mostly been minor, and I've left signs asking people to not do it again, /mail me, etc.)

So the reason I'm posting is to ask for patience, please. And also to get feedback.

1) The exit paths - (see footnote [1])

If you're two towns along a similar axis and want to share a path, I'm asking please let me know. But at the same time, for some distance through the slabs laid down, the paths will be separate.  If you want to combine paths after that point, please do it then. 

2) Chests being put down - so far these are mostly chests of gear from people who died there. No problem! But if you could leave a sign on the chest saying that's why (I'll go add a public chest of signs in a minute) and/or /cmodify @dnynumberone so I can remove the chest once their things are retrieved, that would be great.

3) If you want to help so it gets finished faster - coal blocks are the main lack so far.  I wasn't really around last rev and apparently with the new ore generations, well, I didn't expect coal to be such an issue. I also have a schematic available if you wanted to help build. 

**TL;DR - I'm working on it, please don't remove/alter parts of it (including the signs), I can try to accommodate towns sharing paths, I could use more coal.**

[1] - *puts on whiney baby face* I had an original design based on 8 portals since that was the most popular result of the poll on the forums.  Then the night before the new rev, they announced 4 portals.  I made a new design. Then this Zodiac stuff happened, and made a new 16 path version. I'm trying my best!

<TITLE> [Spoilers All] Ep2/1.1 A (minor) example of...stuff...that I can't say without spoiling. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-22 03:19:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So after last night I had to go start watching all the episodes again.

In Ep2 there was a minor moment that, in the discussion thread and a search of this sub, I can't find any mention of.

SPOILER REMINDER! DON'T READ MORE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS EPISODE/ALL EPISODES SO FAR!

The episode ends with Elliot and Mr Robot sitting on the railing.  Mr Robot pushes Elliot off the railing. 

Just before this, as Elliot is first walking up, there are 9 kids sitting on benches hanging out, listening to hiphop. Right as Mr Robot pushes Elliot off the railing, there's a shot from far back which includes these 9 kids.  Mr Robot says something, taking just a few seconds, and gets off the rail.  There's then another shot from the same perspective, with all 9 kids gone and the benches empty.

There's no way this was an accident in the way it was directed; those kids were *meant* to be included in the first shot and not included in the second.  And given this, I don't think you can write it off by just saying "oh well the kids just happened to disperse in those few seconds."

One possible explanation I can come up with is these kids represented Elliot's childhood/innocence - topics that were brought up in his conversation with Mr Robot.  The song they're listening to is by Mos Def, and I'm pretty sure (not 100%) that this track is from the early 90s, or when Elliot would have been about the age of all the kids in that scene.  

So Mr Robot pushing him off the rails/the kids disappearing, it was Elliot basically trying to wake himself up, tell himself "you aren't a kid anymore," and that he won't be "normal" like all those other kids.

That's my theory at least.

**TL;DR - Mr Robot/The Men in Black aren't the only people that Elliot is imagining.** </TEXT>

<TITLE> For sports radio fans (and non-fans) - Jay Mohr Sports from Fox Radio will be broadcasting from Chargers Camp this coming Monday! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-13 05:37:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First - I am not employed by the show or Fox radio in any capacity, so I'm not just trying to plug a show for any reason other than I like it and it's the Chargers.

Second - This is hands down, bar none, far and away my favorite radio show. When I'm at work and I don't have normal radio, this is the only show I will listen to on any of the Android apps.  (I used to listen to SvP Rusillo too, but since SvP left it's just not the same.)  If for some reason work causes me to miss the show, I will actually download the show when I get home just to listen to it.  That's how much I enjoy it.

I'm going to continue writing about how much I love this show down below after pointing out more meaningful info.

I'm pretty sure the SD affiliate only has the second/third hours of the show and not the first.  If you want to listen to the whole thing here are a few ways - 

Oh important note first - the show is live from Noon to 3pm Pacific time.

1) iheart.com - for normal browsers/PCs.  You can search either "fox sports radio" or "jay mohr sports" and it should pull up the link.

2) the "I heart radio" app.  Same steps as above.

3) The "Fox Sports Listen" app, which is what I use, because this is the only sports radio show I listen to with my phone. **Note:** his hours were switched, and apparently the app programmers were lazy, so if you do happen to tune in and use the "radio" function to listen live, it will say Steve Gorman sports is playing, but that's wrong.  

_______

About the show in general (more fanboy talk) - 

1) Most important - he combines comedy with his show as much as sports. Some of you are probably like, "Jay Mohr...isn't he an actor or something?"  Yeah, he's an actor/comedian.  And that's why I love it. There have been times where I've been driving while listening to the show and I've felt I should pull over and park because I'm laughing so hard it's probably not safe to drive.

2) Integrity - All this deflategate bullshit? He spent 1 day talking about it when it first broke, because he kinda had to.  He spent 1 day talking about it when it was going to go to court.  Other than that he has pretty much not brought it up at all, except to point out how stupid it is and how much he wishes he didn't have to talk about it.  

3) If you're new to the show, there are a lot of "in jokes" that might not make sense.  If you want an example of what is probably one of his best shows ever, using the Fox Sports Listen app, download the 05/07 show. I mean...I've re-listened to this episode like 5 times.  For a *radio show*.  How many radio shows are worth repeating even a second time? But holy shit is it hilarious.

Edit : found links for 05/07 show - (wrong links the first time correct this time)

On android there's the Fox Listen app (which they haven't updated, so if you go to the live/radio feed it'll say Dave Gorman sports).  On android there's also I Heart Radio app, and on your PC there's also iheart.com and you can search fox sports and listen there. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-08-07 03:45:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First - yes I've checked "enhancements" and none are enabled, I've configured my speaker layout so it's the right setup, I've gone through every other sound setting to make sure there are no weird options enabled. 

Second - I've found this issue occurs through any software I use, so it's not a software specific issue. Netflix, youtube, popcorn time, media player classic, they all have this issue.

The shortest way I can describe the issue is it seems like background/ambient noises in movies and shows are much more prevalent now. That's why I think it's maybe a compression/normalization issue. But maybe it could also be trying to force a "3d sound" effect, even though no effect is enabled? Maybe I'm imagining it but I don't think I am. It really does feel like anything I listen to there's a lot more "atmosphere" to it, and not in a good way. </TEXT>

I haven't bothered doing the same with #2 of the Amazing Spiderman series, but when watching it I recall a similar phenomenon.  

I'm in the theater to watch a superhero movie.  Not a bunch of fake/BS drama with people crying, on average, once every 6 minutes.

Second, I just figure it would be better overall if the fan is using the higher rate while playing this game? If every 10s it needs to rev up, wouldn't it be best to just stay revved up?   </TEXT>

According to Panamanian fans, 90% of the US fouls weren't called.

According to both teams, Beckerman smells like licorice that's been left on the dash of a car for two weeks.

For instance, the comics themselves are very often focused on the "day to day" life of the people, the random drama, etc.  Basically, a lot of the things people complain about with TWD. 

And yes, I know TWD the show has a lot of faults.  Not saying it doesn't.  Just curious if people here and on r/gameofthrones/ are as familiar with TWD source material as they are here. </TEXT>

Basically my one and only question is - **what is the gameplay like?**  And so, so, so many times, the preview videos don't answer this question.  They're 99% cinematics.  

I really don't care what kinda fancy video you can create with a few months of time that has nothing to do with the gameplay.  

I'm pretty sure that, with gameplay video implemented, I would have purchased a LOT more games.  But, the game my friend is playing I just checked out to see if I might want to play it; 3 videos, all 3 cinematics only.  

So...fuck it, I'll keep playing DotA2. 

**TL;DR** - If Valve/Steam required that, say, 50% of their total video time required gameplay footage, I probably would have bought a lot more games.  Fuck cinematics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I follow soccer.  I don't have a TV, and even if I did, the majority of the matches aren't shown on TV.  So I use streams.

I have a second monitor.  Soccer match goes on #2, while I play DotA on #1.  

Except...I can't do that with Firefox.  With Netflix/Silverlight, it works fine.  But with sports streams (typically Flash-based), it doesn't work.  And no, it's not the stream.  I've opened the same links on Chrome, and it works fine using that.  

Is there maybe some plugin or something that fixes this issue?  Because otherwise, I have to keep using Chrome just to watch soccer. </TEXT>

<TITLE> New to this game and feel like I've hit a block. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-20 09:33:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Saw a DotA friend playing this, he said he loved the first and the new one was awesome, so I thought I'd give it a try. Thing is, he lives in Sweden, I'm west coast US, so there aren't many times where I can pick his brain for answers.

1) Ship design - he told me I should always be upgrading and doing custom ships, and it's a lot of fun. But, for instance, I built a Human Stewart Class outfitted with mass drivers, and if I mouse over the lower left weapon info, it says "Seconds to Depletion: 400" (or something like that) and next to that for the powered weapons it says "Seconds to Depletion : Infinite." But then watching the battle, it looked like my rail gun ships only fired once, twice...maybe 3 or 4 times? Then I noticed clicking on the ship in-fight, they had 0 power after those few shots...

Is this a lack of power capacitors? Why does it say "Infinite" in the mouseover instead of like 2 seconds...

2) Money/Research. Another thing I was told is I should set up "farming planets" for generating income. So like, if a planet has a max pop of, say, 7, with good base food, should I basically have *only* farmers on that planet? And only do food upgrades there (like soil enrichment etc)?  And planets with small pops and 0 base food, *only* do production stuff there?  But then where does that leave researchers? Just sprinkle them throughout all the planets, 1 or 2 at most or something?

3) Also having trouble grasping when the right times to expand are. There's the research penalty for each colony, so I tend to go slow with colonies. But then I look at neighboring races taking up 1/2 of the galaxy and also with a ton more technologies than I do...(yeah yeah, AI cheats...) 

Tried googling and the wiki and whatnot but not having much luck. 

Any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is AVG Free basically completely useless these days? Also an ELI5 question in post. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-15 04:18:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Former tech support employee, but many years since I worked in that field. When I did, I always recommended people run a combination of AVG Free and Malwarebytes.  

For the ELI5 - This used to be a common issue, but it seemed like all the time when inspecting ole gramps virus-filled computer, AVGF would find, say 16 viruses.  Then MB would find 14 different viruses. Are they made to search for specific things, and each one searches for a different specific thing?

Anyway, back to title post - today Chrome wouldn't launch.  Just straight wouldn't launch at all. Naturally, alarms went off. Ran AVGF, 0 threats. Ran MB, 8 threats. 

I'm pretty good at web security typically - I use a custom hosts file, use ublock and flashblock, and AVGF is apparently running in the background.  But I also have a weakness for soccer, and have to resort to some pretty shady sites in order to watch certain matches. 

So apparently AVGF allowed this virus to be installed through my browser, then couldn't detect anything? 

I guess I'm switching to Avast to see how that goes.

TL;DR - Used to always recommend AVGFree, apparently it's basically useless now? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, I can understand how this may be viewed as an idiotic theory.  I'm just playing Devil's Advocate here...

What if Chuck's call to Hamlin was something along the lines of, "Turn down Jimmy for a job here. If he declines the case out of spite, it shows he doesn't have the best interests of his clients in mind.  If he still gives you the case, even if he doesn't get a job at HHM out of it, it shows he has turned a corner and offer him a job after."

In other words, what if this was a test from Chuck? When Jimmy realized he wasn't getting a job at HHM, and decided basically, "fuck this case"...Jimmy was basically deciding at that point that his pride/honor was more important than, potentially, 350+ clients who were being ripped off.

So maybe, just maybe, Chuck/Hamlin decided, if he's going to throw away the well being of 350+ clients for his own pride, then he has shown he still isn't worthy for a position at that firm. 

If Jimmy, after realizing he wouldn't get a job at HHM, decided "fine, have the case anyway, it will do some good", would Chuck/Hamlin have reacted differently?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> First - This show has been beautifully written, directed, and acted so far.  Dialogue has been witty, the plot has made sense, it's great seeing backstories on some of my favorite BrBa characters.

Second - Despite what I'm about to say, I'm still very involved in this show and want to see more.

Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut...

As we're approaching the season finale, I keep asking myself, "What has **actually happened** so far?"  And the basic answer is...nothing. 

We've gotten a bit of the Jimmy/Saul backstory.  We get a bit of Chuck.  Oh, hey, an episode explaining why Mike is why he is.  But can you actually say anything has **happened** so far?  

The first/second episode, we saw Jimmy conning some teens into a scheme, Tuco, a near-death sentence in the desert...and since then...?  

I mean, character development is cool and all, it's why I still watch each episode and enjoy them.  But at some point the characters have to actually *do* something.  And since basically the second episode, no one has actually done much at all.  

Bearing in mind that by this point, in BrBa (SPOILERS!)- 

Walt starts cooking, poisons/kills two people, a scare from the fire department (he/we thought was police), body melted in a bathtub, Tuco introduced, Tuco kills his friend, among other things.  

Not trying to be a dickhead.  And I'm not saying this show is terrible or anything.  Just that, for being wonderfully shot/written/directed/etc...nothing seems to have actually happened.

**Edit 1** - Episode 7 ends with a "cliffhanger" where Jimmy takes a call in his empty office...and, episode 8, had literally nothing to do with that phone call.  It was a "cliffhanger" ending that never, ever, resolved.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer 1) Sorry for the potato quality images. Apparently the print screen key on my keyboard doesn't work, tried some Chrome extensions, etc.  Finally took pictures of my screen with my phone. Also I couldn't find proper replays and had to resort to a low quality semi-dodgy site.

Disclaimer 2) I've only done this analysis for the first WC match versus Ghana so far.  I'll be looking at Portugal, Germany, and Belgium when I get home from work tonight.

**TL;DR** Doing this at the start because likely a lot of text/pictures - our defensive back 4 is constantly out of position, regardless of whom is playing back there, and I think Bradley got waaaay too much blame from the WC for trying to help that.

**The Problem** - As you can (sort of) see from [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/BUF1KAG.jpg) - our formation is a 4-4-2 utilizing a Diamond midfield.  You could also call it a 4-1-2-1-2 I suppose.  The most important thing to notice about this - Bradley is the **forward midfielder**, whose nominal job is to help distribute the ball to the forwards.  

However, as I'm about to show, that is rarely the case.

**Evidence!** - It turns out I'm not crazy for thinking Bradley was in the backfield way too often.  In the game versus Ghana alone, I found 8(!) examples. And this was a match where we "parked the bus", meaning everyone should be playing strong-ass defense!  How is it that when we're supposed to be playing strong defense, our *forward midfielder* is constantly one of the rear-most defenders?  (And note: I had a cig or two while re-watching this match so I may have missed a few examples.)

[12 minutes in](http://i.imgur.com/o74Cel6.jpg) Bradley is the second closest person to the GK, and apparently one of our back 4 now?

[~18 minutes in](http://i.imgur.com/Z2B5Bos.jpg) Bradley is one of three rear defenders here.  

[~24 minutes in](http://i.imgur.com/yoKlOpO.jpg) Bradley is the closest player to the GK, with only 2 other defenders nearby.

[41 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/HuRW47v.jpg) Right after a dangerous chance form Ghana, Bradley is one of only 3 US players near the GK.  

[52 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/nJMDa3N.jpg) Bradley, just a bit below the guy with the ball, with only one other defender between him and Howard.

[58 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/qcfzUxd.jpg) Hey, there's our back 4! Oh wait, Bradley is one of them again.

[60 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/S7GmMiP.jpg) 3 defenders...Bradley being one of them...

[79 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/tgV7XWs.jpg) For a change of pace, hey look! We have an actual back 4!? Of course, Bradley is the rear-most midfielder in this shot even still.  

[83 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/1hzJ8GQ.jpg) 2 defenders, Bradley, but at least 3 others are at about the same distance.

**Who to blame?** As I said, I saw this problem happening again yesterday versus Denmark.  And that was with an entirely different back 4, and midfield too for that matter.  

*Is it Bradley's fault?*  I don't think so. For almost every one of the instances I pictured, he would soon after be quickly found at the top of the diamond, his actual position.  The dude was playing his ass off and, from my view, trying to shore up our defensive weaknesses.  And it's worth remembering this was during insane heat/humidity.  (Yes he had a few bad touches/passes here and there, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt and blaming exhaustion after considering all of this.)

*Is it the other players' faults?* At least somewhat?  Even if the defense needs help, which it obviously does, shouldn't that be the responsibilities of the rear and central midfield?  Not the *forward midfielder?*

*Is it Klinnsman's fault?* Considering the drastic roster changes between this match versus Ghana and the match against Denmark, I don't know if you can just chalk this up to players forgetting their assignments.  It really seems more like a team philosophy to have the two outside defenders constantly pushing up the pitch, and the "diamond" being more of a blob that just stands at the half-line (to congest the midfield, I suppose?) and makes Bradley do all the work.  

**Conclusions?** - We've seen how often Bradley is the key distributor on our goals, and theoretically that's why he's at the top of the diamond. But time and again we've seen him forced into defensive duties instead because of our team's questionable formations.  If our back 4 remained as an actual back 4 instead of the 2 outside backs pushing up, Bradley might have more freedom to wreak havoc up front. If JK wants Bradley to be up front, then he needs to stress more importance on the back 4 staying as, you know, a back 4.  If he wants the 2 outside backs to push up the field more, then stress that the rear and central midfielders stay that way.  Instead the team seems to be of the mindset of "All but two defenders push up the field, and Bradley, you run everywhere and do everything."

**Finally** - I have three more games to watch tonight after work, so I'll probably post again about those in the next day or two, and try to figure out a better screen capture solution in the meantime.

**Actual Final Note** - Holy crap re-watching this game was awesome.  Even knowing what was coming and when, the first goal, Altidore, the equalizer, the header for the win; knowing all of that was going to happen, it was still so sweet to watch.  When Brooks headed in the winner, my housemates probably thought I was crazy, hearing me screaming "Yeah! FUCK YEAH! YEAAAAAAAAAH!"

<TEXT> A lot of these points were brought up in talking dead, but I think a few were missed - 

1) The infidelity. Rick making a play on blondie reminiscent of discovering the Shane/Lori relationship.

2) Horse gets eaten.  Obvious enough.

3) Rick is a cop! Just like the start of the series.

4) Probably the biggest thing, we got to see them all in a "normal" life situation for the first time in basically forever.  Not since the first ~5 minutes of the show did we get to see any of these people acing "normally," until now.  

Edit 5) oh I forgot! And the song at the end! The first episode ends with a song that is frankly kind of "silly" with how it matches what's going on, and this episode was kind of similar in that regard.  It's been so long!

<TEXT> For awhile I would tell people, "DC animated movies right now are better than a lot of the movies you'll see in theaters."  I can no longer say that.  The last two DC ani-movies have been, frankly, *terrible*.  I say this after watching "Throne of Atlantis" and "
Under the Red Hood" back to back.  The former is entirely childish aside from token swear words to make it seem edgy, has basically no action at all until some generic scenes towards the end...whereas Under the Red Hood has a compelling story line, intricate (and frequent enough) action scenes...

A new DC movie used to be one of the highlights of my year.  I always eagerly awaited the newest release.  But "Throne of Atlantis" and "War" back to back have basically made me give up on this franchise.

Please Bruce Timm...return to making DC animated movies.  They were amazing and wonderful when you were a part of it.  Now they're just generic and boring. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I was very very active last rev.  And this rev, at the start, I was very very active.  And then I became very very inactive.  

Comparing my experiences last rev and this rev, last rev I had built houses in 5 towns, and did the uber-deux project, among other things.  This rev I was basically Rose Rose Rose and nothing but Rose, aside from spleef.

A lot of that was town-building projects.  And eventually I reached this point where logging onto nerd felt more like a chore than having fun.  

So off the top of my head was things like offering custom flairs to this subreddit.  "Pro Tourist rev 15" for building the most houses in the most towns.  "Pro Spleefer" for anyone participating in 3+ spleef tourneys.  "Active Trader" for being highly active in the trade chat.  

I dunno, I remember during the admin hunt in rev 13, hearing multiple people saying things along the lines of, "Wow I've seen so much of this map because of this event that I've never seen."  And I think encouraging exploring/trading/touring other towns, any way to help that, helps keep people interested/active in the server.

Note: I know there was a semi-recent post about how to "encourage keeping PVE active" stuff leading to a forum link.  I didn't post this there because first, it's a kinda old link so I don't think many people are reading it anymore, and second, the forums in general I think discourage a lot of response because people are like "meh, do I really want to set up some new account somewhere just to write a few sentences?"

Late Edit : I have no idea the possibility of this, but something like adding a + next to the user name for each flair they receive here? "I have 6 +'s woot!" </TEXT>

Almost none of his comics were actually relevant or topical in any way.  They were basically just shock-jock level of "oh hey look how insulting I can be, come at me bro."  If he hadn't just been killed by a terrorist, this was basically 4chan level of trolling. Not even that really. 

"I don't have a wife or children or credit" etc, sure that applies to him, but not the other people killed. And, frankly, his comics were awful, pure 100% trolling, but now they're "genius" because he's dead. </TEXT>

<TITLE> As a bit of "desperation" I purchased Heiroglyph. After reading the prologue, I want a refund. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [I recently posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/2qvu7m/is_there_a_dearth_of_good_standalone_scifi_novels/) -

The TL;DR - had a collection of Barnes   Noble gift cards from the holidays, went to try to use them, left utterly despondent because of their 3 shelves of "new" books in the scifi section, a) 70% were fantasy, b) of what were left, about half were zombie novels, and c) of what little was left after that, almost everything was part of a 5 to 7 to X#(where X is a large number) series.

I ended up picking up Heiroglyph.  I'd heard about it before, how it was this "call to arms" about trying to make a positive scifi impact in the greater world.  And it was very much a last resort option; I really don't like short story collections for various reasons.  But I was kinda feeling crap about the lack of any good "stand-alone" scifi novel options, and it was "optimistic", and so I bought it.  

I also love Neal Stephenson.  I don't think there's a single book of his I've read fewer than 3 times; Cryptonomicon was just finished for the ~ninth time.  

But his prologue was just...incredibly depressing.  And seemed completely counter to the spirit of the book.  His prologue basically just crushed what few hopes I had left about science/scifi progressing.  

Maybe it's just post-holiday blues.  Just...I picked up this book as a last resort, thinking, "at least it will be optimistic."  And the prologue by my favorite author is anything but.  He didn't even *try* to end on a positive note.  It was just, "things have gone to shit, and here's why, seeya." </TEXT>

<TEXT> **TL;DR** - had a collection of Barnes   Noble gift cards from the holidays, went to try to use them, left utterly despondent because of their 3 shelves of "new" books, a) 70% were fantasy, b) of what were left, about half were zombie novels, and c) of what little was left after that, almost everything was part of a 5 to 7 to X#(where X is a large number) series.

First - I don't necessarily hate fantasy, I just wish the two sections were fucking separated. I was in the mood for a scifi novel.  "Oh that looks cool...oh fantasy...oh what about...fantasy...maybe that...fantasy..."

Second - I lost my tolerance long ago for any series that lasts longer than three books.  In my experience, anything that takes longer than three books to tell the story means a metric shitton of useless/shitty/boring descriptions of *everything.*  Pages of describing every single thing on sale at a market, or every single bit of food at a feast, etc.  Brevity is the soul of wit; 5-7+ books is just a cash grab usually; get to the fucking point...

Do stores like B+N basically only carry series at this point, because, being a series, they're a kinda "guaranteed" purchase?  Whereas a standalone book might be a risk for sales, so they don't bother?  

I just ended up leaving depressed and irritated.  All I wanted was one good book.   </TEXT>

I didn't really know what to do after that, and thought I'd just kinda let the up/down vote system figure it out.

2) Quality - When this sub was a bit younger, the "hands-off" style seemed to work better. But I'm not so sure anymore.  Strike that, I'm pretty certain it doesn't work anymore.  Without calling anyone out, frankly, a lot of the posts aren't really shittyseduction but just, well, plain shitty.

<TITLE> [Season 4] Speculation about one of Tyrion's lines from Episode 8. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-28 10:22:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The exchange between Jaime and Tyrion in the prison - 

Tyrion: Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. Theres no kind of killing that doesnt have its own word.  
Jaime: Cousins.  
Tyrion: Cousins! Youre right, there is no word for cousin-killing. Well done.  

I was binge-rewatching the season, so when it reached the final episode, and Tyrion shoots his father on the privy, it made me think for a second...

He just committed patricide.  He (technically) had previously committed matricide (his mother dying while giving birth to him).  

He didn't mention, say, regicide (killing a king), and he had no part in Joffrey's death.  He didn't mention homicide, and you could argue Shae was self defense (she grabbed a knife before he had done anything).  

Going back to what he did say, there's infanticide and suicide.  Infanticide?  According to the wiki, he and Tysha were together for two weeks, and secretly married, between first meeting and the rape by the guards that was ordered by his father.  And no one really knows what happened to Tysha after that.  

Was she pregnant with his child by that point? (They do specifically mention that Tyrion and Tysha had made love at least once, plus...the bad stuff could have caused a pregnancy as well.)  Tyrion was basically forced to rape her last.  Then he never sees her again, believing the story that she was a whore, when she was actually truly in love with him.  

Maybe, those awful events, and him leaving her, caused her to commit suicide.  And, in a way, at the same time infanticide.  

Meaning Tyrion was "responsible" for the four -cides that he names.  While the two prevalent -cides that are left off the list, he's either clearly not responsible for, or it can be argued it was self defense (or at most, manslaughter in modern-speak, acting in the heat of the moment/not pre-meditated).

Or, Speculation-B - those horrible events caused a miscarriage in Tysha, but she went on living.  Which would mean suicide would be the one last thing Tyrion hadn't been a part of, hinting at his future? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [S04E04] If you're interested, the painting in the doctor's office and the possible influence on the episode. A wee bit of (maybe) relevant art history. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-13 05:42:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The painting was 'Denial of St. Peter' by Caravaggio.  

To begin there is some direct relevance as, at the end of the episode, the doctor makes a reference to St. Peter, saying if Peter had said anything he'd have been crucified too.

[The painting in question](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/06/08/arts/08FRAME_SPAN/08FRAME_SPAN-articleLarge-v3.jpg) features this exact confrontation - an angry Roman guard confronting Peter, while a maiden steps between them to intervene.  

Some quotes from a NYT article on the painting that seem to bear relevance on the episode - 

"In the best-known works darkness and light wage a battle" - I think we've seen a good bit of this throughout the series, but in the cinematography of the last few episodes, it seems especially relevant.  

"On the wall, the painting is even muddier than in reproductions  most of the light comes weakly over the guards right shoulder, falling on Peter, who makes a universal gesture of blamelessness, turning both hands toward his chest, as if protesting at that moment: Me? Im telling you, youve got the wrong fisherman." Again, referencing both the cinematography of the recent episodes, and the Doctor/Peter comparison.  

But possibly the most relevant bits of interest, relating to Beth - 

"But the longer I looked, the more it seemed to me that the saint  as the symbolic embodiment of the human frailty and faith that underpin Roman Catholic doctrine  was not the lead actor in the drama. It was the maid, whose eyes, catching the light with pinpoint reflections, somehow become the paintings center. "

and

"Her eyes seem to have come unfocused, and shes not looking at the guard she is facing but looking momentarily inward. Whatever precise Counter-Reformation doctrine the painting was once trying to expound, it is the maids hesitation and humanity in the moment of accusation that, to me, now remain as the paintings subject and its power." Which seems to resonate strongly with the final scene/episode in general.  

It just kinda jumped out to me; of all the paintings you could possibly include, why *that* one in particular? It must have some sort of relevance.  And if a Caravaggio, why not one of his more popular works? (There's a wee bit of art history class still bouncing around my head.)

**TL;DR** - On the left we have a Roman guard, and this was meant to be a scene right after Jesus's crucifixion, so he's clearly evil (Dawn/Slabtown people in general).  On the right is St. Peter, afraid of dying just as Jesus had and lying to prevent that outcome (The doctor, lying to save his own skin).  And in the middle is Beth, the maiden trying to save Peter by confirming his lie and allowing him to continue on.    </TEXT>

<TITLE> Odd Bone pooling </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the event is over.  And we only have 1 week to made our /modreq's for spawning skelly/zombie horses.  After the odd bones I gave krapps, I'm left with 14. So I can spawn 2 more horses, and then I'll have 4 left.  I'm guessing a lot of people will have similar odd numbers of odd bones leftover.  

I want to keep 1 more to put in an item frame, which means I have 3 more to donate to a pool, to try to get as many spawned as possible.  

Also if you might be wondering why - we're starting to develop the Rose catacombs (spooky underground areas) and I thought these horses would make a nice addition to those areas as decorations.  

Since I imagine most people want to keep one of each horse for personal decoration, any excess horses to add to catacombs decoration would be appreciated!

TL;DR - I write a lot, wow. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Below is a list of projects. If you think of something that isn't here, just add it below! And if you're claiming a project just say the number below in comments.

1) Nether Portal area redesign. Main goals - making it spawn-proof. So, lots of slabs/glass/leaves/ice/etc. Mostly enclosed with doors/gates/(I don't know?) leading to the rest of the nether.

2) PVE arena help. I've started doing some stuff with this on the planning server but frankly I'm kinda starting to run out of ideas. Right now we really just want a basic design done, primarily walls, so we can build those up in PVE and get the area protected.

3) Pretty-up the ceiling in the carts station, and/or possibly the drop wall. The ceiling in the station is just stone mostly now, would be nice to have something else there. And our return rail is so pretty, the drop wall (just stone/dirt/etc) is pretty ugly compared to it.

4) Enchanting rooms! One by the Town Hall (probably kinda small) for convenience. One by the animal farms (bigger), since that's an area to get XP.  
5) Speaking of Town Hall, removing the pumpkins/cactus/netherwart that's in front of it now, and making that area pretty. Most of that ring area is just acacia trees, but particularly in front of the Town Hall, it would be nice to have nicer gardens. Water, flowers, etc.

6) A better sheep farm, in the area with the barn/etc. Where the differently colored sheep are in their own pens, and the area is safe from mobs coming in and exploding the sheep.

7) Carbon - 2 things here actually.  7a - making it mob proof (lots of slabs/glass/leaves/etc) and 7b - making it pretty (up to your discretion.)

8) Roads! Within the city we need the 400 (diamond shaped) road finished, it's about 1/4 done so far.  We'd also like to extend the South road all the way to Itamashi, using the Spawn road design.  Same goes for making the East road to the world's edge.

9) Iron grinder pod-widening.  You know those random holes in the North side of town, where the iron golems drop?  Their holes are only 2x2.  We'd like them 4x4, with signs placed inside the edges to prevent water flow.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Am I the only one who thinks the "6 days to air" format is kinda hurting the series? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From someone who loves South Park, and also loves the NFL (while also thinking there are a lot of problems with the NFL), this episode just seemed....really really forced to me.  I didn't even slightly chuckle, though the Jerry Jones eyes made me smile at least.

This whole "6 days to air" thing in order for episodes to be relevant...yeah it can work some times.  But I'd rather see them go back to making Casa Bonita styled episodes that have nothing to do with anything, personally.  

This episode just seemed to be trying **so hard** to make a point, that the jokes were predictable and stale.  I mean, if you're a fan of the NFL, and spent any time at all on /r/NFL, a lot of the jokes from this episode have basically already been told there.  In fact, I'd say there have been a few jokes on /r/NFL that were actually better than anything in this episode.  ("You're a fucking Redskin!" "Wow I...didn't think Redskin was offensive until now...")  I mean even the very start, where the kids keep saying random offensive things, and having seen the ad/preview for the new episode, I thought, "Oh I get it! They're trying to come up with a name that's more offensive than 'Redskins' and failing!"  But no.  

I mean there were lots of great little touches in this episode that were amusing; the woman in the elevator screaming, the Redskin player "killing" a server by ramming it with his head, and then showing obvious symptoms of a concussion after...

I guess I'm just saying, this episode seemed to be more about making a point than making a funny episode.  And while a big part of why I love South Park is because they can usually do both at once, in the past few seasons it seems they lean more heavily on one side or the other.  "This episode we're making a statement about a current event.  Next episode we're just gonna be silly.  Then after that, we need to make another statement."  

**TL;DR** - I think with a little more time working on/polishing scripts, they'd end up with a better end result.  Episodes in recent seasons definitely show that they're being "rushed".  (IMO, of course.)

<TITLE> [General Question re:Proxy Services] Would using one of these services "hide" whether I'm streaming or not on various network analysis tools? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-15 04:55:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll try to keep this short.

Friends with people who own/run my ISP.  They've installed...some sort of "service"...I have an "unlimited" download/bandwidth account, but for video streaming services in particular, there's a 2.5 MBps limit.  (I live in a rural area, it's free for me so I can't complain.)

**This part semi-technical but also TL;DR'ed as much as possible, can skip?** 

I use a variety of streaming video websites because it is football season, and sometimes it takes a few tries from a few different websites until I find a suitable stream.  I also have many roommates.  So, say I'm home alone, I can watch a ~2MBps stream no problems.  But if someone watches a youtube video, or netflix, or whatever...then my connection is basically halved by each additional connection.  It's a network-wide implementation so there's no particularly easy way to exempt me from the rules.  

**Continued..**

Does using a proxy service hide what type of format (streaming video) my computer is using?  Thus, letting me use the maximum download speed for streams, as opposed to a 2.5 MBps shared connection for anything marked as a video stream/format? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The unofficial "official" modpack of Rose City </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-04 18:26:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Thanks to pez for setting this up for everyone.  

First you need to use Technic Launcher to run minecraft instead of whatever you're currently using (Magic Launcher, Forge, etc.)  [Download Technic Launcher here](http://www.technicpack.net/download)

Once that's installed, and running, on the left side you'll see a "Add Mod Pack" button.  Click that, and it will ask for a URL, and you paste in there -  

http://api.technicpack.net/modpack/rosepack

This modpack includes -  
Zyins HUD, which includes the horse info stuff.  
Journey Map, which adds a minimap and lets you set waypoints and other features.  
Optifine.  
Schematica, plus Forge and Lunitarius Core which are both required to run Schematica.  

One note about using the Zyins HUD - if you go to the options page for Zyins, on the second page of options you *must* disable any of the "aid" options - Ender Pearl Aid, Torch Aid, Eating Aid, Potion Aid.  Those are not allowed by the server, and you may possibly be kicked/banned if caught using them.  

Edit: Oh one other thing, Technic will create a new minecraft installation, so you'll have to change settings again once it's up and running.  It won't delete your old minecraft.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wondering if there are many precedents for similar injury-riddled players in the beginnings of their careers?  

Part of me thinks that, let's say best case scenario - Bradford gets signed to a good team next season as backup, the starter goes down...does his history of injuries "cause" him to just not play well as the starter?  (too timid/afraid/etc?)

Have there been players in the past that had their first 3-5 years marred by injuries, but they've been able to bounce back and play at a high level after that?  And, how many instances have there been of players with similar high-draftpick/injury-histories that just sunk into the shadows?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> [OleToothless was asking for and planning](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/2dylwu/a_preview_of_the_rev_13_tourists_guide/) his own personal tour of the rev, all the various sights and whatnot to see before the rev ends.

Personally, I'm finishing up a few minor projects here and there, but for the rest of the week I don't have much else to do but play tourist.  

Thought it might be fun to make an "event" out of it, where a bunch of us all travel from one spot to the next for awhile.  Might be hard to hit all the tourist spots in one go, so maybe Wed/Thurs/Fri, earlyish US times (say noon EST-2pm EST each day?) we form a big group and travel from spot to spot?

Maybe t'is a silly idea.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Next rev ideas 3 - Transportation </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-15 12:12:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let's say we get a portal - that doesn't mean that will be our only source of transportation.

1) Roads - our colored roads this rev worked fantastically.  I'm hoping that our road-builders will be back again to help out next rev; but that doesn't mean they won't need help.  Which doesn't just mean help building roads but also, for instance, setting up a quick ice farm/shearing a ton of sheep/collecting resources in general.  

2) Rails - Boring, but you get lots of diamonds and find unexplored caves!

3) A "standard" height for roads (3 blocks), for instance when digging through mountains or whatever, so that they're horse-friendly. 

4) Are we going to bother with canals again? It seemed like this mode of transport required some of the largest amount of time with the least amount of actual use. While I think the canals are pretty, they also seem mostly useless.

5) Overland rail - this ended up becoming my second-favorite method of transportation (after horses) by the end of the rev.  Is it worth selecting a few nearby neighbors (wherever we end up) to connect an overland rail to, even if we have a CARTS/CARBON connection?  Or should that be a later priority?

6) I had another point here but I forget. Edit: I remember now!  Stables!  Smaller/temporary stables near attractions (iron grinder etc), but also smaller stables for the town itself in general.  Rather than one huge stable at town center, have 4 small/medium sized ones in each quadrant of Rose, so people are never too far from their horse no matter where they live.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Next rev ideas 2 - City-wide "standard" build, along the lines of acacia roofs this rev. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-15 11:42:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1) How did y'all feel about that this rev?  

2) There have been a few ideas tossed around about this for next rev, but nothing at all concrete yet.  So any ideas you have are appreciated!

3) For instance, coco recently submitted links of Russian architecture such as [this](http://i.imgur.com/XrZ32.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/Vc5Ht.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/tNJ9v.jpg).  Obviously, saying the whole town could only build in red and white would be waaaaaaay overbearing. *If* this idea is implemented, it would only be for the main buildings (town hall, farms, so on).  

3b) But, we could say to use cobble/stonebrick for roofs, similiar to acacia this rev.  The advantages being that cobble/stonebrick can be made into stairs (popular as a roof material) and it's more easily obtained.  Gray also works well with a number of color combos (red/white as pictured, or red/green, or white/green, and others).  

4) If we're going for a "standard roof" idea again next rev, it seems it should be something that can be made into stairs/slabs, which unfortunately rules out a number of materials/colors.  

5) Is the standard roof played out?  I still think it looks awesome on the livemap but who knows, maybe that's just me?  Maybe there's some other way to make an impression on the livemap without requiring a standard roof?  (For instance, one idea that's been floated out is make a dome encompassing the entire city built out of snow, like those snow globes, in which case, a standard roof is completely unnecessary.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> For better delineation - for next rev ideas, I'll be posting a lot of threads that address more specific parts of "next rev ideas". This thread - **Portal or No Portal** - and how to achieve those ends. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-15 11:31:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1) To Portal or not to Portal?  That is the question.

2) If Portal - We'll need to work out search parties. I suggest that everyone who thinks they'll be around at the start of the rev focus purely on one quadrant of the map (say, South East).  We then (in this post) work out search team groups.  So, say, 3 people loosely spread out and head primarily east.  3 primarily south.  Another 6 primarily SE.  With others "filling in the gaps" so to speak.  That way we could "cover" a quadrant of the map with searchers, rather than everyone running randomly and hoping for the best.

2b) This would require some mumble coordination most likely.  I know a lot of us are averse to mumble, but we'd probably need a bit better coordination than clanchat for this. (Edit: I do have access to a private teamspeak server which I'm sure we could use for this initial search.)

3) If Not to Portal - then we're likely going to 0,1000 again?  Yes, it's a *minor* inconvenience having to go to Spawn to get to a portal, but it's not that bad really. But hop on a horse, take CARTS or CARBON or Overland rail for 1 minute...it really ain't so bad.  

3b) Do we have a team set up an initial build at 0,1000 just in case we don't find a portal, so we have a backup?  

3c) If we choose to go to 0,1000, or end up there cause we don't find a portal, we would need some dedicated rail builders.  It's not the most glamorous position, but I for one could do that since I'm not exactly the most talented builder.  

Also as a disclaimer yaddayadda - if an idea here ends up the most upvoted, it doesn't necessarily mean it will be implemented, just that the mayors will take it heavily into consideration and all that jazz.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> I have no idea of the difficulties implementing this idea, but *if* it's possible...a /clanchat mail feature? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-15 11:11:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1) basic idea - say there's a link on your town's subreddit that you would like everyone in the town to read, /mail send c:rosecity http://reddit.com/r/mcrosecity/plstoread

2) I can easily see how this idea could overwhelm server resources, so it could A) only ~~mayors~~ clanchat owners could use this feature to send mails, and/or B) the mail doesn't *have* to be sent instantaneously, but say one user gets mailed per minute...so a large town (150 users), it takes 150 minutes to send each user the mail.

3) I dunno...maybe even, if user(x) hasn't been active in (y) number of days, the mail doesn't bother sending to them.  

You mods and admins do a ton for us already, so if this idea is just silly hard to implement no worries! I just thought it might be a nice feature to have in order to aide city/town/group coordination.  (/mail send c:spleef reminder guys, spleef tomorrow!)

<TITLE> Sorry to be vague - ~2002 there was electronic group based out of Portland, OR. I can't remember their name. [x-post r/portland] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-13 02:24:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Other than the genre and timeframe, the only other clues I can really give are (I *think*) the album was like one long song, almost.  Where like, one song would kinda blend into the next song.  *Maybe* it was a mix that they turned into an album, can't recall exactly.

I also think the group name had two words in it, with Electronic (or some variation) being one of the words.  Like Electronic Cannibals, or Electronica Thieves, or Electronic Ninjas...or something like that.  

Sorry for being so vague, but it was 10 years ago that I got this CD from a friend and at some point the CD disappeared from my collection.  Lately things just keep reminding me about them and I want to give it a listen again.

Since electronica can be fairly vague, it was most in the style of, say, Prefuse73 or Caribou/Manitoba style, but a little more danceable?  [Listening to this mix by Jon Hopkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQiWz80RqRI) was the latest thing that made me think of that group again, though I don't think they were quite as polished as that mix.

Also there were no vocals, purely instrumental, if that helps.  (Maybe some voice samples, but not many if so.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'd like to see a "new PVE rev" meeting held here, instead of mumble. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-11 02:36:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a list of reasons, the TL;DR of which is - more feedback from a wider audience, less timezone bias, less of a "circlejerk" bias (just hearing feedback from the same/only people who ever use mumble).  

From clanchats and general chats, it seems a lot of people would participate in a thread on this sub, rather than an arbitrary/timezone-exclusive/specific-program-exclusive thread.

Anyone can reply to this thread, that has a web browser and reddit account (which, as the "official/unofficial server of reddit" and how most people find their way here) means a majority of people can reply.  Whereas forums/mumble require separate accounts/apps, plus being able to logon at the right time...

Basically, if we want the largest amount of feedback from the widest range of users, we should talk about it here.  If we just want to hear from the "elite"/"power-users" then mumble/forum. What's the balance we're looking for, here?  

Edit: "sorry" for asking for a better method of community feedback? ~~4~~ 6 downvotes already without a single response?  I thought mcpublic was better than that...

Edit 2 : Seriously, if you disagree with me, at least say why? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Two things - First (and primarily) it's likely a new rev (possibly a short one) is coming soon, so let's start planning in earnest. Second, let's host the next spleef tourney? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-04 04:52:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1) I posed awhile back about plans for next rev, but I was probably a bit premature with that post.  However, with the recent mumble meetings, it seems a new rev is probably coming soon. Also from the mumble meetings, it seems there might likely be a (short) rev next, while waiting for 1.8 plugins to update, and then another new rev.  

So...

A) There were some good ideas from diffi and pez (and others) regarding next rev, but now it seems like the next rev might be so short (3 months possibly?) that some of those ideas would be better saved for the next rev that would presumably last longer.

B) Rose planning server!  Let's not let this valuable resource go to waste, courtesy of twil. 

C) This post is just to generate ideas and discussion.  It seems the "central dome" idea has fallen to the wayside, but a nice central meeting place is still a good idea.  Moving certain farms (hopper-intensive ones) away from the dome, and moving others closer (like the veggie farms) would be good.  I'm sure others have ideas for semi-basic tweaks that could improve performance in Rose.  

D) Let's just get some ideas flowing people! Even if they're blue-sky/silly ideas, let's hear them and maybe we can make the silly ideas realistic.  

2) Spleef - Ghrey and I won the last tourney in Orbit.  I now have a spare beacon which I plan on donating to a future cause.  I'm happy to donate it to the winners of a Rose spleef tourney.  

A) If we're hosting, what other gifts can we round up?  We can't donate ONE beacon, because winnings have to be able to be divided equally.  (I could donate my second beacon if y'all felt like helping me replace one of them...)  Diamond blocks, emerald blocks, etc... would be nice.  

B) People stacker!  We got it pretty tall last time, but I think we could get it even taller!  If we agree to host the next spleef tourney then I'd like to see more of y'al turn up for the next event!

**TL;DR** - Time to seriously consider the next rev, and possibly the one after that.  And let's gather some prizes for winners of the next time we host spleef, whether next time (this Saturday) or next! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Make it in the Over World, but have it spreading from "the nether" (bedrock) up.

1) Dig to bedrock, spread nether rack/brick up from there.  Then build the uber project in the over world from there.

2) It's already, as the name implies, a super project/ordeal.  Add into that equation the location (fairly hard to get to) and the location (hard to transport materials to) and the location (ghasts while climbing ladders and potentially angry pigmen) makes it a good bit more difficult.

3) Uber seems to basically be dead in the water at this point. I haven't seen an /c #uber message in quite some time, and the construction site is the exact same as I last saw it 2ish weeks ago?  

So, take the same basic Uber idea, except have it be like the nether is "leaking" into the over world.  Easier for people to reach + easier to transport materials = easier to get people to join in generally? </TEXT>

<TEXT> First - I was very opposed to the Uber project since it took place in the nether, and that would hurt skull hunting.  But since most of my beacon projects are over, I'm mostly over that objection. 

Second - The Uber project seems basically dead at this point.  Really it looks like almost everyone has given up on it.

Third - so...how about we take over the project?  Not necessarily "officially" make it a rose project, but it seems a number of us are at loose ends lately (what with the town being built up) so a community effort may provide good results.  I mean, we recently decided to build a PVP arena and a handful of us were able to combine resources and finish it in a pretty short amount of time.

So how about we pitch in and give a good ole community effort to finish the Uber project?

<TITLE> So...about those villager traders? Just trying to find out what's possible, not trying to whine. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-22 05:26:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Block grief?  It can be rolled back easily (I'm assuming?) enough.  Animal grief? They can be replaced or easily bred again. 

But villagers. That shit takes hours.  And a ton of resources.  I was sitting on 3 stacks of emerald blocks, and it took all that (and more) just to get 2 new paper traders, which were both broken within a week.

Now, it's true, we could all just lock down all our villagers, make them all trusted users only, have to break a block which requires region perms, other security measures like that.  But many of those kinda seem contrary to the nature of the server, which is let (practically) anything and everything be open to anyone?  

It's just that, as opposed to other forms of grief, 5 seconds of negligence/intent can cause 4+ hours of work to restore.  

Some thoughts just off the top of my head - 

1a) change the "planned restart" message to a different color than all of the other messages from the alert list.  Bottom line is, there are so many alerts I just sorta tune them out.  30 alerts, all the same color...it's kinda easy to gloss over them. 

1b) Specifically mention in the "planned restart" message to close your inventory and STOP TRADING.  I know if you open your inventory there's an anvil noise/warning.  Again though, the "planned restart" message is the same color as every other server message (29 of which can be ignored) it seems any extra attention to the fact would help.  Change the planned restart message to include things like close inventory/stop trading?  

2) Is it even possible to have a server plugin just ignore villager trading 60 seconds before restart?  I'm ignorant of this sorta stuff.

3) Any non-server-side suggestions for how to help this problem?  Solace has gone through 7 Bob's.  Aypop/Seneca has had a similar number of issues. Within 1 week of discovering both of Rose's paper traders were broken, and then replaced, both of the new ones were broken.

It's just reaching the point, and pardon my french, but how many damn freakin hours are we going to spend on this problem before we can find a workable solution?  

Surely we can come up with something that doesn't involve "permanently lock down all villagers and only allow them under intense supervision."  I hope?

Edit: Just trying to brainstorm/bluesky idea here.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Soooo... the Rose City Head Museum has finished construction! (Note to self : never build an erdtZAC design again.)  One problem, however, is the design accounts for 117 heads, and we have around...36.  

First - any noteworthy past players/mayors that may have been missed during the head-hunting? (For instance, noticing I don't have a FrankLloydCrank head.)

Second - was going to do a "friends of Rose" section.  People who aren't a part of Rose but are good friends (already have Flumper and Aypop and the admins, could add ghrey303 and more people along those lines.)

Submit some names, and let's have a dopple killing day soon.  

Edit: I guess a list of whom we have so far would be handy.  Thought I'd break it down into four sections (since there are 4 areas to place heads).  1) current/prominent members.  2) members who may not have been around all that much. 3) Past members (previous to this rev).  4) Friends of Rose.

In section 1 we have -  sisigwithrice, assasymphoni, krapps, zomise, y0urwhitefriend, kevo, erdtzac,  difficult and dickicult, twilexis, starlight, tic   ice, super__coconut, sneakypablos, pez   merp, sylkre, skiflea, rivae, dannie williams, quzzarboy, (adding SourPickleEater, can't believe I forgot D: )

2) aghe87, temporarilyalone, santibanez, admanta, scarybilbo

3) claff319(?), axisarchon, soon to add  tyran, lloyd, duck, cream, clefe

4) have buzzie, kitcat, totemo, would like to add the rest of the mods/admins, flumper, aypop, soon to add ghrey303 and open to other suggestions.  

Also in the trusted chests there is a book and quill to add any names there, or comment here. </TEXT>

Robin Van Persie - 2 / 3  
Arjen Robben - 2 / 3  
Karim Benzema - 1 / 2  
Tim Cahill - 2 / 2  
Neymar - 2 / 2

________

**Netherlands 3 - 2 Australia**

Goals in - 20th Minute (NED) - 21st Minute - (AUS) - 54th Minute (AUS) - 58th Minute (NED) - 68th Minute (NED)

Notes : 

Australia officially eliminated following Chile's victory over Spain.  

Tim Cahill has scored 50% of Australia's World Cup goals.  He also may have played his last match in the World Cup as his second Yellow Card means he'll miss Australia's final match against Spain.

______

**Chile 2 - 0 Spain**

Goals in - 20th Minute - 43rd Minute

Notes : 

Spain eliminated following their loss.  This is the fastest the former Champion has been eliminated in World Cup history.  (Not including Italy in 1950, who played in only a three team group.  1966 Brazil, 2002 France and 2010 Italy all had a chance to move on coming into their third match, while Spain was eliminated after two.)

Depending on the Spain - Australia match's outcome, Spain may also have the worst goal differential of former Champtions in World Cup History.  (They will need to win by 5 goals to tie the worst goal differntial; they will need to score 3 to tie the most GF.)

________

**Croatia 4 - 0 Cameroon**

Goals in - 11th Minute - 48th Minute - 61st Minute - 73rd Minute

Notes : 

Alexandre Song served a straight red card in the 40th Minute with an ugly punch to the back of Croatian player Modric.

Cameroon could have faced a second Red Card near the end of the match with some team in-fighting.

Scores from today's matches - 

**Switzerland 2 - 1 Ecuador**  
Ecuador scores at 22nd minute - 1-0  
Switzerland equalizer at 48th minute - 1-1  
Switzerland go-ahead goal at 93rd minute - 2-1

Other notes : Switzerland's go-ahead became the latest game-winning goal in World Cup history!

**France 3 - 0 Honduras**  
France scores in 45th minute - 1-0  
France scores in 48th minute - 2-0  
France scores in 72nd minute - 3-0  

Other notes : Honduras's Wilson Palacios receives the ~~first~~ second Red Card of the tournament so far.

**Argentina 2 - 1 Bosnia and Herzegovina**  
Argentina scores in 3rd minute - 1-0 (Own Goal by BIH)  
Argentina scores in 65th minute - 2-0  
Bosnia and Herzegovina scores in 85th minute - 2-1

Other Notes : Watching the replay of Argentina's second goal, there was a slight deflection off a Bosnian player so, in a way, both of Argentina's goals were Own Goals by BIH.  (Though the second was likely to go in regardless of the slight deflection.)  

Also - Bosnia and Herzegovina's first appearance in the World Cup finals, and also their first goal!  While some other nations have visited the World Cup multiple times and failed to score a goal yet.

Also - On the other end of the spectrum, BIH has scored the fastest Own Goal in World Cup history.  

**Golden Boot leaders as of today**

Robin Van Persie - 2 goals  
Neymar - 2 goals  
Karim Benzema - 2 goals  
Arjen Robben - 2 goals

<TITLE> [S4E09] I've seen lots of talk about how many Crows were killed/size of the Wildling force/etc. I tried to quantify it. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-09 11:12:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Here is a small album of shots explaining the numbers of the forces from previous/current episode.](http://imgur.com/a/HvAJo)

Image 1 - From the previous episode, it's stated quite clearly there are 102 Crows left.

Image 2   3 - Screenshots (from the current episode) of the (South of the Wall) Wildling encampment (Ygritte, Tormund, the Thenns, etc).  It's hard to get a precise count, but it looks to be around 24 of them. (Note: After counting deaths later, it was likely closer to 30-35.)

Image 4 - Ygritte estimates 20 Crows are guarding the castle, while the rest are on top of the wall.  Note: It's not like she has x-ray vision so she doesn't know how many are inside buildings/etc.

After that point, it'd be a shitton of screencaps to show every single death.  But here are my notes while rewatching - 

Crows - 102 - 101 charging the gate - 100 23:07 - 99 - 23:31 - 98 23:40 - 97 - 96 - 95 (tormund knocks 3 out but doesn't necessarily kill them) - 94 (giant arrow) - 93 (i think? 27:47) - 92 - 91 - 90 (possibly) - 89 - 88/87/86 (ygritte) - 85 (storming the kitchen) - 84 beheading - 83 pyp - 82 allister dies - 81 thenn kill - 77 (oil explosion) - 76 (fail piggyback) - 74 (long shot) - 73 - 70 (tormund/thenn kill spree following ghost) - 64 (defending the inner gate).

Wildling Sneak Attack - ~24? - 21 charging the gate  - 20 allister's first kill - 19 - 18 - 16 - 15 - 14 (i think?) - 13 - 12 boiling water - 11 cleaver - 10 pyp - 9/8 (allister again) - 7 sam kill - 4 (jon in on the action) - 2 (ghost in on the action) - 1 jon before thenn fight - 0 bigbad thenn dies - -1 ygritte - Tormund captured.

So it looks like the Crows still have somewhere around ~70 people to defend following the attack.  I ended up at a -1 count on the Wildlings when Ygritte died so my initial estimate was off, but probably not off by much I guess?  The first time I watched the episode I thought Crows were dropping like flies but after watching again it looks like the deaths were pretty 50/50 between the two camps. 

Some disclaimers/notes :

1) I'm assuming there was a fair bit of artistic license in terms of killings, and the Crows will probably end up with more than 64 people still alive when all is said and done.  But who knows?

2) I only counted what looked like an actual kill.  A lot of people were punched/kicked/knocked down/knifed in the leg or what have you, so they may still be alive.  And maybe even some of the "confirmed" kills weren't necessarily mortally wounded.  

3) Again, it was dark and a lot of them were wearing similar outfits, so a kill credited to the Wildlings might easily have been a Crow kill instead, and vice versa.  

Anyway, as I said a lot of people seemed to think the Crows were getting wiped out and I thought I'd try to put into numbers what the "total" kills were.  And as with a bunch of people fighting with swords it seems it was basically a 1:1 ratio, as you may expect.

Edit: **TL;DR** There were around 25-30 Wildlings attacking the castle south of the wall, they killed around 25-30 Crows, if the show was literal in terms of deaths.  So ~70 Crows left, assuming not too many artistic liberties.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Next Rev goals/planning. Just a place to post thoughts/ideas, nothing definitive. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-31 18:33:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From general chat and elsewhere - 

1) Going to 0,1000 again.  This has some great pros, a few cons.  It's nice that it's basically halfway between a portal and spawn, so it's not really that inconvenient.  The one thing I would say about trying to get a portal tho, is that it's kinda disheartening how many portal towns are basically empty this rev.  Vinhaven, Argoth, Woodbury, kinda Oasis...all portal towns that are mostly ghost-towns at this point.  So part of me thinks it would be nice to have a portal just so it gets "properly used/developed".  

1b) But, being a (possibly) portal town also generally means more popularity, thus more noobs/griefers/storage-emptiers...so yeah being a portal town would probably mean more work from the higher-ups keeping on top of all of that.

2) Diffi posted some really nice ideas about next rev's planning in terms of town layouts, but I think a few tweaks could be made.  

a) Central Dome - Diffi's new dome is definitely an improvement but...domes are just kinda so easy what with dome-generating algorithms out there and all.  I think we could pull off a nice central/main building that was different.  

b) Moving a lot of farms/grinders outside town central.  I think we all know the obvious benefits from this re:lag.  But one of the things I love about this town is how active the town center is.  It seems I can rarely go downtown without seeing 2+ people in the process, as opposed to (no offense just first thing off the top of my head) Seneca, where all the main farms/grinders seem so spread out that you never bump into anyone else.  I think we could find a good compromise of non-hopper-intensive farms/grinders near the center, and just moving the hoppery things towards the periphery.  

Anyway those were just my recent thoughts on the matter, and of course any and all feedback is encouraged! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure most of you are familiar with the (many) reasons I'd suggest this...

Just seems like a minority of folk provide a majority of supplies, and a minority of others take a majority of supplies.  

I'm not suggesting this purely as a punitive sort of measure, but thinking it might also encourage "some" people to help contribute; i.e. the "general" meat chest is empty so they decide to go breed/kill a lot to resupply, which may help them earn a "trusted" supply room status.  

Just a thought. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Experiencing a weird lighting glitch in nether fortresses, where floors are lit up even with no light source nearby. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-17 19:02:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Some images for examples](http://imgur.com/a/cP5bH)

We've been trying to make a more efficient wither hunting area, so you don't have to run up and down stairs and through small corridors etc.  There is a lava lake under all of that, but about 40-50 blocks below. I've completely removed all the nether bricks in those areas and there is no hidden lava or glowstone or anything.

Also weird is that a few of these areas, if you just stand still in the middle of the light for between 5-30 seconds, sometimes (but not always) the lit up floor will go dark.  But if you leave that spot, about 30 seconds later it lights up again.  

Oh and some of these lit up areas are directly above pillars, so even if it's the lava ~40 blocks below, how is it transmitting through the pillars that far? And why isn't the whole floor lit up?

And I have seen this happen in other non-modified fortresses as well.

The minecraft wiki/trivia/issues hasn't been much help either, which is why I thought I'd turn to you folks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When two matches are played simultaneously, **for the love of god stop showing scores from one match in the other.**

We live in an age of DVR's, downloadable matches, hell I wouldn't be surprised if World Cup matches are put up on their website to re-watch after a match.  

I don't want one match's scoreline ruined while watching the other.  If someone feels the opposite and they want to know, they can whip out their phone or hop on their computer or whatever.  

I can't remember which match it was during Champion's League, but I did a really great job of not looking at any popups of the score from the other match...until the 90th minute when I accidentally saw the score and thought, "Well I guess I won't watch that other match I recorded after all..."

<TITLE> Proposing a small series of nether spawn experiments. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-13 02:49:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let's try to solve some of to experiment on some of the great unknowns regarding nether spawn rates.  It seems there's lots of speculation and not much fact.

These experiments would have to take time around, say, 3-5 AM PST, as those seem to be the least populated times, so we'd have less interference from people who don't know about this/don't pay attention in chat.  

And if someone has better ideas for experiments just pass it on, I'm not all that knowledgeable about this stuff to begin with.  

The experiment would be varying the # and locations of players in the nether for, say, a 30 min interval each.  

1) 1 person at one fortress, trying to track # of withers in a 30 min interval.

2) 2 people at one fortress, etc.

3) 2 people at two fortresses, on opposite sides of maps, etc.

4) 2 people at two fortresses near one another, etc.

5) 2 people, one at fortress one at random location, etc.

And so on.  

It seems like maybe in this manner we could get a better idea of, say, if a few people are off quartz mining while another is trying to hunt withers, what the likelihood would be.  And...other things.  

Dunno, just a thought. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A big part of why I love DotA2 has nearly nothing to do with the gameplay itself. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-23 02:51:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is awesome.  But it's the extra settings that I love so much.

1) Flawlessly handles (in my experience) multiple monitors.  I typically run a dual monitor setup, and sometimes I use my roommates projector to "watch" movies while playing.  D2 + VLC playing IASIP?  No problem.  

In February I got into the Arma2/DayZ mod pretty heavily but...awful dual monitor support.  Other games, they're typically allright at it but every time I install a new game it's a toss-up whether it will work easily or not.

2) Multiple **audio** output support.  This one is much rarer in games.  But, as stated above, I usually have one monitor acting as a "TV" while playing on the main screen.  So I want the audio from the videos I'm watching playing over my speakers.  But Dota2 needs a mic, and I have a headset and what do you know, Dota2 easily works at having video over main speakers and game through the headset.  

This is so much, much, much more rare in games.  DayZ? Either everything through speakers or everything in headphones, no way to split.  Same with Elder Scrolls Online.  Same with Minecraft.  Same with Diablo 3.  Why is this even a problem?  

3) The alt-tab friendliness.  I mean, does this game understand its users or what?  When I solo queue, I play exclusively AR.  Which means usually a 3-5 minute wait.  So...I alt tab to browse reddit.  And, even though as stated above I have D2 playing through headphones, when a game is finally joined guess what happens?!  It plays a noise over my main speakers, so I don't have to wear headphones the whole time, and the icon even flashes on the taskbar!  

Anyway, that's all.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm watching The Wire for the first time.  Yeah it's a shame I waited this long.  Just finishing the third season now.  And damn...I really wish I had some folk to talk with.  So I came up with this idea for a sub.

Also thought it would be useful for current TV shows, but for the non-EST folk.  The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad...would have loved to participate in discussion threads for these shows, but I live in PST so I have to stay away from fear of spoilers.  

I only just created the sub and haven't put too much time into it yet, like how to set up threads and stuff like that...but I'm not sure how much interest there is in this thread so I'm not getting into that just yet.  

Just throwing the idea out there.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My roommate had 3 books on his bookshelf and he highly recommended them.  I was looking for some new reading material so I started the series.

Finished book 1, didn't love it but I did enjoy it.  Finished book 2, eh there seemed to be a good bit of filler material, but I was still enjoying the world/plot.  I finished both of these in one week.

As I picked up book 3 to start, my roommate mentioned, "Oh yeah, there are actually 5 books in the series."  At which point my enthusiasm took a sharp downward turn.  It's been a week since then and I've only made it about 1/4 of the way through book 3 because while I've enjoyed the series, I don't think I like it enough for 5 books worth of reading.  

I look up where I can get the final two books online, and then I discover there are actually **eight** books in the series?!  And now my enthusiasm is totally crushed.  

I've always stayed away from any book series that lasts longer than 3 books.  

[This review of the final book](http://januarymagazine.com/SFF/chungkuo.html), which basically says (jokingly) that the author was kidnapped and this was one of the worst novels ever written doesn't give me much hope either... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically, I've started the process of taking over my parent's business, which is real estate appraising.  And I've always had a thing for architecture.  

I'm kinda wondering - say someone who owns a house by Frank Lloyd Wright decides to sell; would an appraiser be used to judge the value of the house, almost more like an art appraiser?  Or are those sorts of things more like some rich person decides they really want that house, so they make an offer and the two sides negotiate and no appraising really needs to be done?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was reading about how the NFL tried to create a "super helmet" to reduce concussions but, ultimately, they found it was impossible to do such a thing because the brain sloshes around inside the skull and there's no real way to stop that.  

I jokingly (at the time) thought - oh so you could just inject some foam inside their skull so the brain doesn't get jostled!

Obviously a silly notion but it did make me wonder is that space between brain/skull necessary?  Aside from injuries are there other instances of the brain swelling from just normal, hum drum reasons?  Even though my "idea" would never be used, theoretically could you inject a foam (or gel or you know what I'm getting at) in that space with no ill effect? </TEXT>

Second - my second monitor is kinda old and doesn't run the same resolution as my primary monitor (1920x1080).  

What happens is - I have a video playing on VLC, I launch DayZ, and the video keeps playing in a way, the audio is still going and if I alt tab the frame catches up to the playback.  But while in DayZ the video itself is frozen on a single frame.  

Anyone have any success getting videos to play while the game is playing?   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-02-08 23:31:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Most of us really dislike the rest of reddit for reasons that are pretty understandable.  Well I managed to create a front page that still keeps a lot of the random interesting stuff while ignoring the crap.  

1) First and most obvious is install RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) and block most of the default subs in the settings/filters area.  There I have, you know, /r/funny /r/adviceanimals etc all filtered so they don't show up. 

Now there are a few different ways to do the next part, I'll start with what I used and then the other ways.

2) I went to "All" and clicked Next until I was several hundred links deep...like links 600-625.  Around this time you'll start finding the highest rated links from fairly obscure subreddits.  Whenever you find a post/sub you like, subscribe to it.  Keep going through these deep /r/all/ links and keep subbing to anything interesting/odd/whatever.  Now when you visit your front page you'll have a diverse/interesting set of links while not having to deal with the crap on regular reddit.

3) Similar idea but different - go to r/all/new/ and do the same thing.  I don't like this as much because all/new can often include a ton of really awful/boring links.

4) Another variation is - go to /r/all and go maybe 100-200 links deep.  Keep this tab open for several days.  Then click "next" after a few days.  You'll start getting links similar to #2, the top links from obscure subs, and they'll again be pretty random while also being the highest rated links from those subs so it helps filter the random crap.  

Happy redditing!   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Chargers fan.  Not blaming this loss on the refs, don't think there's a "conspiracy" to get Manning/Brady.  This pretty much squarely falls on the shoulders of our horrible offensive game plan for the first 3 quarters.  

Which brings me to the point of this post - In the time between beating the Bengals last week and facing the Broncos today, Ken Whissenhunt, our OC, interviewed with **three** teams.  And I can't help but think that (at least partially) explains how sluggish and uninspired our offense looked for most of the game.  

If the Chargers decline requests to interview him, they look like assholes and it makes it less likely people will come to work for us in the future.  

I get it, the new front office wants to get their people in and start building their program right away.  But the offseason is long.  Is 6.5 months instead of 8 such a huge difference?  

Edit: since this keeps coming up; "teams need as much time to prepare..." pretend the Chargers reached the Super Bowl, in that case they'd need to wait those weeks anyway.  And if it was a blanket rule, "NFL teams cannot interview period until after the Super Bowl" all teams would be on equal footing. 

Also coaches frequently talk about how their players should "give 110%" or whatever.  If they're interviewing during playoffs, how can that be taken seriously? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm watching Troy, you know, the Brad Pitt movie.  I know it's probably highly inaccurate but it made me wonder a few things.  Some instances - 

1)They repeatedly show shields blocking direct blows from swords.  These were, by the looks of it, thin wooden shields, and it seems like when more advanced technology like steel would rip those shields apart after just a single blow.  

2) It seems like most "armor" was leather - would this protect against most glancing blows and only really be susceptible to a piercing strike (point of the blade)?  Again it looked like most deaths (in the film) were from piercing attacks, or blows that landed on exposed flesh.

3) There's the phalanx-style of attacking, where the front line has their tall (4 feet or so) shields, and the line behind them have spears and they're stabbing over the tops of the shields...so it seems like those shields would be very strong against the spears/swords they'd go against.

And if you could explain how/why swords/spears/etc may or may not have been effective against armor/shields that would be great.  I mean...I'm guessing it's because they only had iron, so the swords would dull at a much faster rate than steel, hence why a piercing-attack was the only effective way?  (If that's true.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been basically not doing much with this sub for awhile now as some of you may or may not have noticed.  Thought I'd take a moment to let you know what's up and whatever, and a chance to hear from all a y'all.

To begin - I've been mostly hands off because I don't really know what to do with this sub.  I started it as a joke, someone in /r/shittyaskscience asked if there was a shittyseduction, there wasn't, so I made it.  

That being said, I don't really know what to do with this place.  If you asked me, "What makes a great shittyseduction thread?" My answer would be, "I have no idea really, I just know a good one when I see it."  

I mean, this sub has grown from about 1,000 people a year ago to 3,500 now with little/no involvement on my part, so I guess things are going smoothly?  But I don't check in all that often, so I don't know if I've missed posts talking about the state of the sub or anything like that.  

Anyway, just checking in.  If you think I'm doing a shitty (pun intended) job here, let me know, I won't ban you for speaking your mind.  Any other suggestions or whatnot, again, just let me know.  And if you want to be a mod here and think you'd do a good job/be more active/help css/whatever...let me know and I'll think about it.   </TEXT>

[I wrote about this problem on /r/nfl awhile back](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/xabry/dear_rnflers_this_started_as_a_joke_on/) but looking at some of my submissions in other places - in /r/movies I have a 218 self.post with 738 comments, in /r/startrek another self.post that's 173/363, another /r/nfl post is 99/340, a /r/gameofthrones post is 92/630...those are all self.posts.  Whereas say in /r/gameofthrones I also have a 1394/184 link post, at /r/childfree a 352/72 link post...

It almost feels like reddit should implement some bit of code that says if a user gives more than 2 upvotes to comments in a thread, the thread should automatically receive one more upvote, or something, to help promote discussions.

___________

There are obvious exceptions - just because something is a link post it doesn't mean good discussions won't happen; and just because something is a self post doesn't mean the number of comments will always be greater than the number of upvotes.

It just seems like this would help "level the playing field" for self posts to reach their respective front pages more frequently than the "easily digestible" link post where all you have to do is read the title or look at a picture.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Inspired by a comment, I thought I'd write down the definitions of the various types of fandom. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-01 21:38:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I dunno, someone mentioned the difference between a bandwagon and fair weather fan somewhere, and it got me thinking.  So here are my thoughts on the different levels of being a fan.  Thoughts? Changes? (Note: originally written for r/nfl but thought it might be better here, to explain the football-bias in descriptions.)

**Die-Hard** - They own more than one jersey.  Often owning one of even their "bust" players jerseys.  Sundays, Mondays, Thursdays (and some Saturdays) are off limits 17+ weeks of the season.  Even if their team isn't playing, they're watching.  They have season tickets no matter how bad their team is, or they would if they could.

**Loyal** - They love their team and follow them for life.  But they only own a few pieces of paraphernalia.  They watch their team's games, probably any games involving their Divisions/Conference. They stick around through thick and thin, but wouldn't even consider painting their faces in a million years.

**Fair-Weather** - Again they'll follow their team for life.  But if it's a down year, well...maybe they'll watch the games but maybe not.  Or maybe they were born in that town so they're a fan, but don't know more than a few players' names.  

**Bandwagon (A)** - The first type of Bandwagon fan - they know almost nothing about the team they're cheering for, but they live in the city or have a lot of friends who are fans of a certain team, and suddenly that team is looking awesome and wow aren't they a big fan!  Sure they'll watch the game with you this weekend!...while saying things like "man they should onside kick every time!"

**Bandwagon (B)** - They have a favorite team already.  But for this season, maybe even the next few...know what?  That other team looks pretty cool, or I just love how their season played out, or I really respect that player...so fuck it I'll cheer for them too! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Sorry for the specificity of this post - But I recall when the NFL/Ref Union reached their agreement, part of the deal was phasing in newer/less-experienced refs. Anyone have better details on this? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-30 06:07:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First) I'm having trouble googling the "details" that I think I'm talking about.  Something like part of the deal was that the NFL got the power to start adding less-experienced refs to the crews, theoretically as an attempt to "train" them?

2) If true, anyone have any details about who some of these newer refs might have been, what games they might have officiated?

c) Could this maybe just be a short term issue, as these newer refs are being phased in, and things will be better in the coming seasons?  

Edit: This is the best I could find and it's nothing definitive - 

Additional crews[edit]
The NFL currently employs 17 officiating "crews"one for each of the 16 games played, plus one extra. The league wanted to hire three additional crews, bringing the total to 20 crews. The league claimed this would improve the quality of officiating, since they would have a larger pool of qualified officials to choose from, rewarding the best performing crews, and giving them more flexibility to "sideline" or "bench" poor performing ones. The union indicated that they believed the NFL was using the issue to distract from the core issues in the negotiations, due to the fact that the proposition was introduced so late in the negotiating process,[22] and because a provision for adding officials already existed in the previous CBA.[23] However, referees felt that making it easier to "bench" them undermined their job security, and since officials are paid based on the number of games worked, increasing the number of officials would invariably reduce the number of games worked per official, thereby reducing each official's average pay for a full season

It doesn't say what the official (pun wasn't intended) decision was in the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically - two monitors.  Not that unique I know.  But I haven't had a problem like this with any game before now.

On one monitor I play movies/tv shows from my hard drive on VLC full screen...on the primary monitor I run the game.  Except for DotA2, I've had no problems doing this.

But with DotA2, it really fucks with my secondary/VLC monitor.  I can't run fullscreen, but have to run the video at a certain size, positioned in a certain way midway between the two desktops, and then I can view it (window mode) while playing D2 (full screen mode).  

Anyone have any tips on how to play D2 fullscreen while on a second monitor watching movies full screen?   </TEXT>

<TITLE> My roommates completely and utterly refuse to "punish" their dogs for being shitheads, and I'm left feeling like an asshole for being the only one to do so. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-15 06:28:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First, note: by "punish" I even mean just raising their voices or something like that.  There's one dog in particular that barks like a shithead almost every time someone enters the house (or even if it just *thinks* someone is entering the house).  His owner just laughs it off, "aww he's being protective" or at *most* will say, in a pretty calm voice, "Fox knock it off."  So I'm listening to this tiny dog yap his fucking brains out, and I'm the only one who actually loudly and sternly says, "Fox! Quiet!"  

And I'm feeling like a huge dick because I'm "punishing" someone else's dog.  Like they're thinking, "Hey, that's my dog, it's not your place to do that."  (Throw in that his owner is only around for a few hours once every few days...)

Another dog in the house constantly tries to bite people's feet when he's in a certain mood.  Now this I mostly shrug off, I think it's even kinda cute some times...but we had a house party last night and he was doing it to *everyone* and the owner was just occasionally like, "Hey hey, not cool" to the dog instead of, again, raising his voice, pointing a finger, making him sit outside for awhile or something...

There was a point awhile back where I thought I didn't like children, and I realized it wasn't really children that I disliked, but their parents.  I love dogs, but I'm starting to reach a similar point where dogs are getting on my nerves because of their shitty fucking owners.  And oh, hey, now apparently the onus is mine to teach your shitty untrained dog how to not be shitty.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was really upset with Verizon, with their removal of unlimited plans and basically paying +$20 more per month for just a 2gig contract.  I thought I'd "vote with my wallet" and switch providers.  

And wow Sprint just totally sucks so much fucking ass.  It's weird because for the first week the service seemed to work great...during that one week where I can get a refund.  (I kept my old Verizon number because I wasn't sure how it would work, but that first week with Sprint seemed good enough so I decided to cancel my Verizon account after that week.)  

And now, holy shit.  My text messages fail all the fucking time. Opening imgur links when not on wifi fail all the fucking time, regardless of the number of bars I have. 

Just...wow this service is really terrible and I don't get (well I kinda do) why it was so great for the week where I could still get a refund, and now that that week has passed, my service is just fucking terrible in every way.  

I can't help but think that they give some sort of "premium" service to new subscribers to make them think it's good at first, then drop their coverage once they're locked into a contract.

<TITLE> Chargers fan here, and r/nfl has been flooded with MVP talk so I thought I'd come here instead. As much as I hate to say it, I really think Brady deserves the MVP over Manning. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-12 03:36:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As much as I hate to say it, I really feel like Brady should win it this season.  I mean how on earth are the Patriot's not competing with Buffalo for worst team in the AFCE if Brady isn't at the helm this season?  

Maybe the same is true for Denver.  Their stellar D isn't looking so stellar after all.  But Welker, Holliday, Moreno, the Thomases...I think they'd probably be second or third in the Division with just a "pretty good" QB.  ~~Not to mention the Patriots walloping the Broncos.~~ (sorry was maybe a little drunk)

Basically it seems like, take Rogers (pre-injury) or Manning and make them the starting QB in New England, and the Pats would probably have a worse record than they do now.  Whereas put Rogers or Brady on the Broncos, and the Broncos would be more or less the same record.  

I get that Manning has gaudy stats this season and is likely to break Brady's single season TD record.  I guess I'm just saying I don't think those stats are *just* because of Manning, and really the stats should be second to record, and when you put the Patriots and Broncos records side by side and consider the personnel...

Well.  Fuck.  I'll say it.  Brady should be MVP.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After watching [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgvOHnujspg feature=youtu.be) of a bad snowy-roads accident in Wisconsin, plus having a shitty experience or two in the past few days of my own, thought I'd send this out.  Sorry if some of this seems demeaning or whatever, but again these past few days have made me think it's necessary.  Some of y'all might be from areas that didn't have much snow or whatever, so this is moreso for you.  

1a) Because I just remembered this after writing almost everything else - *allow more time to get where you're going.*  Normally it takes you 10-15 minutes to get to whatever place?  Plan for 30-40.  This relates to almost every other point. 

1) Drive *slower.*  So you bought studded tires, or snow tires, or you drive a Subaru or a 4x4?  It doesn't matter.  Drive. Slower.

2) Give a much larger cushion between you and the next car.  Normally it's 2-3 car lengths.  Aim for more like 5-6.  

3) *Sudden* direction changes are your enemy.  Try to make everything as gradual as possible.  Not just stops/starts, but turns/roundabouts, etc.  

4) Please, do not be an asshole.  If someone in front of you is driving really slowly ("too slowly" for your tastes)...don't ride their ass or flash your lights or whatever.  Some people haven't gotten their snow tires installed yet or they're just being *careful*...you're basically pressuring someone else into being irresponsible and possibly getting into an accident.  If the person in front of you isn't comfortable driving at a higher speed, it's very likely you shouldn't be comfortable driving at a higher speed either.  

Be safe out there first and utmost.  Being late to something in these conditions is secondary, and if it's really *so* important for you to get there ASAP, it's your fault for not leaving earlier, not the person in front of you's fault for not driving fast enough.  

Edit: Wow the troll downvoters.  I'm saying be safe and it's like I'm saying kill babies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Fumblerooski is an actual play, not just a nickname for a fumble.  The Chargers were the last pro team to successfully perform it (and one of only a few to ever try it.)

It was in the game listed in the title.  For those who don't know what an actual Fumblerooski is - the center snaps to the QB who immediately puts the ball on the ground behind the center, then starts running in some direction.  While the D is chasing after the QB, the FB or RB picks up the ball off the ground and runs elsewhere.  

It was an amazing play to watch, partially because of the tremendously huge balls required to call that play, and then it actually worked.

Unfortunately, if you go to NFL.com and find the highlight of that play, the one highlight they have, the cameraman is so fooled by it you can't actually see what happens.  I remember at the time there were other highlights that showed other angles where you could see how crazy it was.  But those highlights don't exist on NFL.com.

So maybe someone here is crazy about recording every single Chargers game and has this on a dusty VHS tape or something?  I'd love to see this play again.  

Edit: [Here's a link to the nfl.com video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/san-diego-chargers/09000d5d801d32a0/Lorenzo-Neal-Highlight-WK-14-vs-Broncos-2006) but again the cameraman is so fooled you can't really see what happens.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> TWE - wow.  I watched it twice in two days.  The first time I left feeling that, while utterly entertained, it didn't have the big laughs of the previous incarnations of the trilogy.  I was trying to think of how to describe this movie to a friend to get them to watch it when I realized how awesome this movie was, which made me go back the second time.

The best part about TWE is that it's almost completely unable to be defined as a genre.  My initial thoughts, because of what I thought the movie would be like, "Well it's a comedy, but..." Well, it's also an action film, with nods to both American and "Eastern" (kung-fu/whatever) styles of action flicks.  But it's also scifi....kinda, but almost in the basest of ways, particularly since the "scifi" part of the plot basically revolve around one of the oldest/most common scifi ideas, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers".  It reaches the point where there's no way to describe it other than "It's just a very entertaining movie".  

Ender's Game - I enjoyed it...while also doubting I'll ever watch it at least a third time.  (Gotta give it one more go just to make sure...)  The running time is listed at 2 hours, but I know for a fact I was 12 minutes late to the "start" of the movie, old people buying tickets in front of me, still caught two more trailers before it started...and it was precisely an hour and 45 minutes later that I walked out at the start of the credits.  

The reason I bring this up is because I really think the movie would have been much better off at around a 2 hour 30 minute mark.  ~30-45 minutes longer than it was.  

The movie hit all of the basic plot points...but that seemed like all it was.  Just a "okay next major formative scene" followed by another "okay next major formative scene" until the credits roll.  I can get why what really happened with Bonzo was changed because Hollywood/PG-13, but I'm not just talking about that.  I just couldn't help but feel like the movie was mostly "Okay let's get this over with".    

Book spoilers now - [](#s "His time at Battle School and the lack of the whole "loose international alliance waiting to turn on one another once the war is won" stuff, really seemed like it could/should have been included, even if you don't include the Locke/Demosthenes subplots.") </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not the fault of the refs really.  The rulebook is so dense and filled with legalese that it's really pretty much impossible to properly define a lot of things.  

Obviously this topic is opening itself to a bunch of jokes, but really; couldn't the lot of us come up with better descriptions of when things are/aren't a foul?

The way I see it, and I'm a bit tipsy so I'm likely to forget at least one glaringly obvious thing, but we can break the "on the field" rules down a good bit, can't we?  All those off the field rules we can set aside for the moment.  

Have some ideas but curious about how this could all be made simpler?  Where a call doesn't invoking 4 sub-clauses from 3 different rules in order to be interpreted?

<TEXT> First, there was a season or two during the Schotty years.  Maybe I'm just remembering wrong, but it seemed more like our O was able get a comfortable lead in many games and so the D was playing to more predictable opposing-team-offenses.  

Second, yeah Seau was great.  But was the D as a whole really considered in the top tier?

Finally, I also remember the year we were technically #1 on D (and on O) and missed the playoffs, but again were we really a "dominant D" at that time?

I guess what I'm getting at is - lots of teams can look to a certain, say, 3-5 year span of saying "Oh man our D was so great when we had players X, Y and Z, among others."  Whereas with the Chargers it seems like we maybe had 1 or 2 guys who played really well, but not necessarily the entire unit, for an extended amount of time.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) The "best of r/nfl thread" - so this week, the top four images (I stopped looking into it at this point, but I'm sure the rest follow a similar pattern) - Image 1 = 13th comment from the top, Image 2 = 4th, Image 3 = 1st, Image 4 = 4th...basically, if you actually spend any sorta time around here, you've seen all these comments.  Previously, this thread was run independently and actually highlighted a lot of the lesser-seen comments. Now it's run in the same sorta circlejerky/mod-suck-up/"let's celebrate the people already celebrated" kinda way that makes me call it a circlejerk.

2) The complete and utter loss of identity(identities) from this thread because of mods taking over so much.  Anyone else remember that game thread last year, 1st Quarter, 2nd Quarter, 3rd Quarter, (nominally 4th Quarter but instead) Eli Time?  It was those sorts of quirks and insertions of individuality that made this sub so great.  But this year?  No, all the  game threads have to be created by /u/nfl_mod because **it's so important that every thread remain consistent.**  Really?  Is it really that important that every thread be consistent?  To me, those little insertions of humanity ("Eli Time") far outweigh the supposed benefits of consistency.  

3)  Completely ...how to phrase this properly... totalitarian dictatorship responses towards threads?  the "NFL Insomnia" thread. It was allowed once, before week 1, then removed every subsequent week that someone tried to post it.  It wasn't deemed "relevant enough".  Almost every recurring thread here is posted at an EST-friendly time, and basically fuck everyone who lives elsewhere.  NFL Insomnia thread, West Coasters, Europeans, various other international folk, could actually contribute in a way where they'd end up near the top of the comments, because the timing of the post let them. But the "insomnia" post was no longer allowed because it wasn't deemed relevant (while the "haiku" thread was, among numerous others), and...well I guess that's it really.  If late-night/international people want to talk about football, they can just be the 2000th comment in a thread or shut the fuck up and say nothing.  

r/nfl, you're turning into ESPN.  That's not a compliment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spoilers all following, basically -

The way the novels follow from this point out are basically pretty interesting and involving.

But I've watched a lot of this show with my parents who haven't read a single book thus far.

So I'm just wondering; how well will they adapt to the basically gigantic changes from here on out in the TV series?  Yeah there are big changes in the books/show up to this point, but from here on out things mostly take place on different continents, and in a way "restart" lots of storylines from where they were before.

**Okay I'm seriously getting into spoilers here for real, I know I only hinted before but it gets serious now so back out if you don't want more**

I mean...Arya moves to a different continent and basically "starts over" for a good portion of what would be the next two seasons...Jon goes through similar (though not as geographic) changes...Dany is basically caught in politics on a far off continent for a long time...and many more similar examples. 

I just wonder how, say, halfway through the next season, I could conceivably tell my (non-book-reading) parents "nah it's good just stick with it" when basically things from here on out more-or-less "start over" in terms of tearing down old heroes, building up new ones, blah blah blah.  

(I will absolutely grant that this whole post may be out of spite, that it seems I read a lot of stuff just to get it all thrown up in the air again, and I'm basically just...afloat in this universe and no longer caring about who ends up where and/or why.)

Edit: **TL;DR** - The *huge* changes that occur in books 4-5...I just wonder if TV followers can really follow along with that, because (to me) these sorts of changes are the type that those with short memories/attention spans won't really care for/pay attention to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was waiting in an airport, thought I'd see if there were any good books, picked up one called "Line of Polity" by Neal Asher.  It was amazing.  This was at a time when google was still getting off the ground and all that, and it was a UK writer (bought the book in an Australian airport), so I couldn't find much about him at the time (2003).

I re-read the book a few times over the next few years and when the interwebz finally started really taking off, found out this was the second book in a five-book series.  

The thing is, it's a really good stand-alone novel.  I lent it to a friend last Summer and told him it was book 2 out of 5, but he should still read it, and he loved it too.  The rest of the series is similarly awesome, though this one in particular will always hold a special place for me.  

It's very much in the style of Richard K. Morgan and James A. Corey; really interesting characters, either in the military or maybe ex-military and "shady".  Really interesting tech/foreign planets/etc.  Gripping, "it's 1 AM but I want to see what the next chapter brings" kinda stuff.  

It seems he still hasn't broken out of the UK market that much.  Which is a shame, because he's awesome.  

Also awesome - he has two other series (between 3-5 books each) in the same universe.  There's also a fourth series, though it doesn't take place in that particular universe and I haven't read them yet, though I'm about to.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of people don't like Peter King, but I enjoy regularly reading his MMQB and Tuesday followup.  Though I often skim large chunks when I can tell he's about to go on a wank-fest or what have you.

And having said that, I've read his columns for many years...and except for games that may have ended 6-3 or something like that, and even then, I'm pretty sure this is the first time that not even a single WORD about the Monday Night game was mentioned in his Tuesday column.

I think it's because we get called fair-weather fans frequently, and granted we do have a good amount of those in house.  Hell I've bitched about the Chargers on /r/nfl plenty. 

So I'm just wondering what positive changes we can take to finally get some attention when we deserve it.  Even when we were Super Bowl contenders, almost no one talked about us at all.  

Thoughts on how we could improve this situation?  I almost never use my Twitter account, but I just sent out two tweets towards King about not getting coverage because dammit.  And I notice in /r/NFL I often see Chargers comments only at the very end of a given thread.  So we could do a better job of upvoting each other (while hopefully avoiding the "seahawks circlejerk" phenomena of only being able to reply to a comment by making a vague reference to our own team)...

I dunno.  I'm just tired of having so little response to games like this.  Maybe somehow we as fans can do a better job of bringing attention to the team by being more active on social media and whatnot, or something?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gonna do a quick paraphrasing before getting to the gist of the matter, and sorry, this might sound a bit rambling but there *is* a point, I swear it -

He talks about the difference between the "Mundane" and the "SF" (Speculative Fiction, not Science Fiction) worlds.  He uses Hugo Weaving (you know the main baddy from the Matrix) as an example first, how he did lots of "Mundane" work (plays, artsy films, etc) and was very popular in that world, but really became *popular* popular once he entered into the SF world.  

Now the relevant parts, and I'm not going to write the entire essay but just some select quotes - 

**Vegging out and Geeking out**

[paraphrasing] We know what vegging out means.  We just want to put something on and not think about it too much and let it wash over us.  Geeking out is when our intelligences are put to a test and we actually think about what we're watching.  Many of the best movies/books/TV Shows/etc employ a combination of both.  We want a good amount of vegging out, but just enough geeking out to keep us involved.

"The classic example is in suspense movies, when someone, usually a pretty girl, is running away from a monster or a serial killer, when she happens to trip and fall down.  Whereupon, instead of simply getting to her feet and running some more, she sits on the ground whimpering until the threat catches up with her.  ...The satisfaction, and the solace, offered by good SF, is that its characters don't behave that way.  Consider how Ripley [Sigourney Weaver in Alien(s)], responds to the threat posed by the aliens.  In the second film, once she and the Marines she's with have made first contact with the aliens, and had a chance to catch their breath, they very quickly agree that they should simply go back to the orbiting ship and nuke the place.  **It's a brilliant move on the part of the film-makers, precisely because it is the obvious and intelligent thing to do-it's exactly what we in the audience are thinking to ourselves-but because it's a kind of horror movie, and we've been conditioned to expect stupid behavior from characters in horror movies, it's the last thing we're expecting.  When the idea is raised and agreed on, we wake up, sit a little straighter in our chairs [geek out] and say, 'Oh! This is a movie about REAL people - which is to say, people who behave intelligently.'"**

And that incapsulates my problems with this show's last two seasons pretty freaking well.  There are just far too many instances of people behaving non-intelligently.  Even when they're supposedly intelligent people.  **Here are the S3 spoilers stop reading at this point if you don't want them.**

Perhaps the most perfect example of this is Andrea in the chair with Winston(?) turning into a zombie in front of her, and she's trying to grab the pliers with her feet to break the handcuffs holding her there...and in *several* instances she stops actively trying to get those pliers in order to *talk!*  And remember, she's a lawyer, she's supposed to be pretty fucking smart!  It's unintelligent and counter-intuitive and just plain bad.  There are plenty of other examples like that, but this is the one that sticks out most plainly in my mind.  And it's why I have such problems with this show.  They don't have to be rocket scientists.  But when a few million viewers are shouting at the screen "WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING (IMPLAUSIBLY STUPID ACTION X)!" well you're doing something very wrong at that point.  That this show seems to keep invoking that reaction shows they just have lousy fucking writers.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) There's this whole "Seahawks=bandwagon" thing going on because they're more prevalent lately.  Well first, our numbers have blown up tremendously in general over the past two seasons.  Second, Seattle is a pretty "tech-y" city, so it makes sense lots of them would use reddit and whatnot.  Third, as a Chargers fan myself, I know what it's like to be largely ignored by the media/rNFL/etc, so when success comes along, you're more likely to be vocal about it, instead of the usual "oh...okay..." attitude.

2) I got into a long talk with a Seahawks fan just the other day, about why he uses an NFC flair instead of Seahawks. Basically, he found that he couldn't contribute to a thread without people automatically assuming he was a homer/bandwagoner/etc.  Whereas with NFC flair, he could make the exact same comment he made elsewhere, and instead a quality discussion would ensue.  

3) The reason I post this is the top comment-thread of the "Judgement Free Questions Thread" - someone with Seahawks flair posts about why are the Broncos considered hands down the best team in the NFL by far.  At some point someone says "No need to get mad because someone says another team is better than yours." to which he responds "Never said the hawks are the best" which is 100% patently true - at no point did he say that in even the slightest way.  The next (and highly upvoted) response - "Oh please, that's your entire point."  

Hey even I've made jokes about them.  But I'm starting to feel bad about it.  

Maybe their numbers have increased, but that just means the % of jerks have increased, as the % of jerks exist in every team's fanbase.  But as a collective, we're starting to make wild and offensive assumptions about the *entire* fanbase.  Basically as a whole, we're acting how we acted towards Saints fans during Bountygate, where they just couldn't voice an opinion about something without a bunch of troll/downvote shit following.  

In summation - Fuck the Seahawks, fuck the Broncos, fuck the Saints, fuck the Patriots, fuck e'ry team up in here except mine.  But let's not let that shit get out of hand.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> A not-so-brief summation on the end of the NE/ATL game, and why coaches should go for it on 4th and short and/or go for the TD before settling for an FG. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-30 06:25:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before I get into it, I want to first say I understand Smith did the "safe" thing because otherwise he gets crucified.  

Now let's go back to the end of the Fourth Quarter.  Atlanta drives to the New England 3 or 4 yard line, trailing by 10 points.  They reach 4th and 1.  Here is where Smith lost the game (by doing the "safe" thing).  He chose to kick a field goal.  

First - I understand Atlanta has had some issues with 4th down conversions over the past few years, but I don't think that's a reason to just concede the down.  

Second - a field goal makes this a "one score" game, but there's a huge difference between a TD and an FG in the final minutes of a game.  

To begin, Atlanta was in an almost optimal position here.  This wasn't, say, 4th and one at the goal line, or at the 12.  This was 4th and 1 from the 3.  If they can get one measly yard (which is statistically probable) they have four more downs to score a TD.  *While at the same time, keeping all of their timeouts.*

Instead they kick the field goal.  Now it's a 100% given they'll be doing an on side kick.  Best case scenario they recover, but those chances are pretty dreadfully low.  So you're basically assuming at that point -

1) You're giving the second best QB in the history of the game the ball back.

2) He only needs to make it about 30 yards to get into FG position, at which point ATL is down by 10 again.  (Whereas if they went for [and made] the TD instead, they would only be down by 6.  This means they need a TD to win, but they needed a TD just to tie before.)

3) Okay there was a botched snap/fumble in this *particular* instance, but that's an incredible fluke.  If it wasn't for that, it would be fairly safe to assume the Pats make their fourth and short conversion.  Now ATL needs to burn all their time outs, and hope to block a field goal in order to have *any* chance.  

4) Let's assume they do precisely that - burn all their timeouts and block the field goal, which barring a fluke fumble, is their only chance at all by this point.  Now they have 0 timeouts, probably somewhere around a mere ~50 seconds left on the clock, and have to drive 60 yards *and score a TD and nothing else will work but that.*

So let's say Coach Scrotey McBallsy was in charge of ATL.  

A) He goes for it on Fourth and 1 at the 3.  He now has 4 downs to get a TD, or fine maybe he doesn't test his luck and kicks an FG the second time blah blah.  But in this situation, they only need a mere *two yards* to score a TD.  Not 70+.  

B) He doesn't get the on side kick either.  But now the only thing that kills his hopes is a NE TD.  If they settle for a FG, fine, he needs a TD, just like Mike Smith would have needed it.  Except in this case, a TD *wins rather than ties.*

C) Let's say they even managed to stop NE sooner, where a FG wasn't viable.  Sure they've probably burned all their time outs at this point, and there's probably also only ~1:10 on the clock.  But now they only need to drive maybe ~40 yards and kick a FG (high % play), instead of 70+ and score a TD (lower % play).  

Atlanta lost because of a lack of balls.  Smith gets to walk away (largely) unscathed because he played it safe and gets to blame his players for lack of execution.  Julio had a crazy good (and crazy low probability) catch that got them close so it makes it seem like Smith made the right calls.  But at the same time, that Julio catch had them in FG position for a tie, if they'd gone for the TD and made it before.  

Note: Most of this is from having read many grantland/"thank you for not coaching"/mmqb/tmq articles.  Too lazy to look them up for sourcing stats atm.  Also I'm a Chargers fan so I've seen my team lose because of "playing it safe" way too fucking often.  

Edit: As someone brought up, thought I'd point it out here - 

If NE scores a Field Goal it's game over regardless.  After an onside kick it's hugely probable (especially NE) will do so, it just didn't happen to turn out that way because BB has balls and went for it on Fourth (and won).  NE only has to go ~30-40 yards to make a FG and win.  In the Scrotey McBalls scenario, NE has to score a TD or they might lose.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> All this Freeman talk.  Chargers are my team but every few years I pick a "second favorite" team, someone who I think is on the rise but not there yet.  When the Saints got Brees, they were the team.  Then they won an SB, so I switched to the Bucs, around Freeman's first or second year.  I really wanted to see him do well.  And every post I see about Schiano being a jerk makes me feel Freeman got shafted.  But, seeing his play and attitude during games...I'm starting to think maybe I just wanted to see him do well strictly for the reason that I wanted to see him do well.  

I really haven't watched enough of the Bucs the last two seasons to really have much knowledge of the situation.  I just hoped Freeman would kick ass is all, and I'm a bit sad it didn't work out that way. </TEXT>

Fourth - Generally speaking the song is somewhere between "rock" and "electronic"...it has a very party vibe kinda feel to it...it's kinda "noisy" in that most frequencies are spoken for by one sorta noise or another...

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll try to be as brief as possible.

I work at one of two cafes owned by the same people.  There's a West and an East location.  I predominantly work the East, while the people I'll soon be talking about work West.

Similarly, two owners; a divorced couple.  The ex-wife predominantly West, the ex-husband predominantly East. 

And finally, two of my coworkers started dating; both predominantly West, the girl occasionally East while the guy is almost never East (and I am 99% East).  

The boyfriend just got fired.  He was assistant manager, for all intents and purposes.  He was fired for a variety of reasons I won't get into, but they were basically valid reasons.

Now, this Sunday, just two days after the boyfriend gets fired, I'm scheduled to work with his girlfriend and the ex-husband co-owner.  

Earlier I tried to bring up to the ex-wife co-owner that maybe it wasn't the best idea to have her working the same time as the co-owner, since maybe his resentment would rub off on her.  I'm still pretty doubtful she'll even show up that day at all.  

The female co-owner gave me a, "Yeah but she is very professional and mature and she could use the support" thing, which I mostly agree with; she is very professional and mature...but she's also privately voiced things to me like she was willing to quit and walk out over various things...which I couldn't bring up to the boss because she voiced them in confidence.

I'm just really worried about this Sunday.  If she even does show up, how maybe even the slightest slight from the male boss might make her walk out because of this whole thing.  

Has anyone gone through something similar?  Should I be expecting the worst?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This [CBS Sports Power Rankings](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/powerrankings) is the latest and probably the worst, but I've seen similarly bad predictions about the Chargers this year.  I mean this one has us 27th, behind the Vikings (really?) the Cardinals and Rams (really?!), the Titans and Bucs...

Part of me thinks ending up with the 5th overall pick next year wouldn't be the worst thing.  

But c'mon, we have an established QB, Mathews and our other RB's were looking great, the O-Line is mostly fixed, and our D is looking more respectable.  Each one of those teams that gets placed before us has a big fat question mark at QB, most have O-Line's just as shaky if not definitely worse, and aside from one or two big names (Revis suddenly makes the Bucs a great defense all by his lonesome?) D's that are in tough, high-scoring divisions.  

Bah.  I guess we'll find out soon.

Go Chargers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you're the sidekick to James Bond.  The villain is in a plane taking off down a really long runway (cause it's a huge plane so it takes a long time to lift off or whatever).  

You're driving a car, trying to catch up with the plane, so Bond can jump out of the car and onto the plane before it takes off.  

So you're just flooring it you know, so you can catch up.  Here's the thing though; at the end of the runway is a giant cliff, because that makes for a more dramatic chase.

Bond Jumps off and lands on the plane!  Now you have to stop the car.  Just to make it more dramatic, rather than simply hit the brakes, you pull a 180 (okay I'm actually stealing this all from the Captain America movie I'm watching right now).

MY QUESTION!  It's here it's finally here - 

What is the best method for stopping the vehicle at this point (summation - driving really fast, pull a 180 and need to stop)?  Would you just hit the brakes?  Or would it actually be better to keep flooring the gas at this point?  (And since this is from Captain America, this is a car built before ABS was around)

Sorry for the long-winded post, and yeah the idea of stopping that way is probably just silly, but it made me wonder. </TEXT>

<TITLE> While watching preseason games, it seems the QB's are more mic'ed up/louder than in regular season games. And because of this, their cadence when snapping seems very predictable. Does this change through the regular season? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Like watching the Ravens game last night, Flacco was loud as hell, and I can't remember the exact wording he used now, but it was something like, "Ready?!  Ready, hut!" Pretty much every time I paid attention.

Watching GB now, I'm hearing Rodgers say "Green 18?! Green 18, hut!" 

And every time it's pretty much the same pacing on how he says that, just like Flacco last night.

So 1) from what I remember, it seems rare for QB's to be so audible (pun intended) during the regular season.  Are networks restricted from playing this audio during the regular season, but not during the preseason?

2) Are the "ready set hut" calls much more variable during the regular season?  Because the way it looks in these two preseason games, it seems like it would be very easy for a D-Lineman to "guess" the snap most of the time. </TEXT>

Similarly at work - I use Pandora.  I have a custom station with lots of songs from the 40s/50s and lots of modern stuff.  The 40s/50s stuff - super quiet, I have to walk to the back and turn up the receiver by 30% or so.  Then a modern song comes on and I have to go to the back and turn the receiver down 30%.  

I just find it so hard to believe that people were complaining about this sorta stuff in the 80s, and 30 years later we're making graphene and "teleporting" data and landing rovers on Mars yet it's still "impossible" to just have a given movie/set of songs/etc stay a consistent volume.   </TEXT>

They're really, truly doing "adult" style movies, with the only bias being 
"it's animated so it's for kids".  

If you can overcome that bias, you'll realize what a fantastic collection  of movies awaits.

And as the title states, DC is winning this race in a huge fashion. But Marvel still has a good number of good animated movies.

<TEXT> Okay this is largely a rhetorical question.  One company is pumping money into the venture, the other isn't.

It's just crazy to me how DC pumps out so many freaking good animated movies.  Marvel tried, for awhile it seems, then gave up I guess?

Planet Hulk, Hulk vs Wolverine, Hulk vs Thor, and to a lesser extent the Ultimate Avengers movies..

But they still pale in comparison so so much to Batman Under the Red Hood, Justice League - Flashpoint Paradox (which I'm watching now), Batman Year One, Superman - Doomsday, Superman   Batman - Apocalypse, Superman   Batman - Public enemies, etc etc....

DC is just pumping out amazing animated movies one after the other while Marvel seems to have started then gave up.  

Again, mostly this is rhetorical.  But holy fuck DC is making some awesome animated movies while Marvel isn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll try my best to make a long story short - 

A friend is trying to create a TV show...maybe online only, maybe a pitch at a proper show.

He filmed a kickstarter "ad", he filmed much of a "first episode", he's had several meetings at my house discussing ideas.

I haven't been included in most of this.  But I'm vaguely friends with the guy.  So as an outsider, I can see any number of problems with everything I've seen/heard.  

His kickstarter "ad" was horribly edited and not very interesting to boot.  He filmed much of the first episode without having much of an idea about how the first season (let alone the entire storyline) would pan out.  

I want to tell him these things but as I said, I've been left out of almost this entire process, so I'm not sure how to go about it without just seeming like "oh you're just bitter because you haven't been a part of this project".  

It's not that I want to see him fail. I don't want to see him succeed either.  I'm entirely neutral.  I don't want to discourage him, I just want to say what he could do better, without seeming bitter. And I guess I don't know how to do that.

Edit : note, his first kickstarter campaign was hoping to raise $5k, and raised only $1.2k, $1,000 of which came from a single good friend of his.  I offer that as "proof" that I think the idea isn't very valid/well executed, and has room for improvement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So to begin, I stated this thread wasn't for Peter King haters.  But I'm guessing more than a few will show up anyway because reddit.  So to you folk I offer this - I don't adore Peter King, I don't treat every word he says like sacrament, I don't jizz when he mentions the latest marathon he's running.  But he does get access to a lot of players/coaches/etc that other people don't get access to, and he can offer good insights in that regard.  Two quotes for why I like Peter King - 1) Possibly Confuscious? Probably not - "Even in the foulest of swamps a lily may bloom."  2) An old roommate of mine - "It doesn't matter which news station you watch/read/whatever, right wing or left wing or whatever; what matters is *how* you watch it."  So there, that's why I read MMQB and derive enjoyment from it.

That stuff being out of the way - What are your thoughts on the new layout/"specialness"/etc of the new MMQB?  I'm still not really sold on it - I just wanted to read the "normal" MMQB and not get bogged down with all these changes.  But anotheranother part of me always hates change at first, then typically grows to love it.

<TEXT> Basically - three of us live in the same house, we all downloaded at the same time (plus another instance on a fourth guest computer).  

We didn't realize there was a Steam version at the time.  Just DLed off the website.

Now that we know there's a Steam version, we want that, since we have more friends on Steam and it's easier to coordinate etc.

Naturally, we don't want to download 4x9gigs again.  Any way to "move" the native installation to Steam? </TEXT>

<TITLE> So I has me a crazy idea that would require the participation of a few others. an r/NFL internet-streaming announcer group, practicing during the season and culminating in the Super bowl. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I lived in Australia from 2000-2003.  During that time the Olympics took place there.  For certain of the main attractions, a comedy troupe would perform on radio; they'd do a pretty good job of actually narrating what was happening at the event, but they'd throw in their own funny anecdotes/snarky comments/rude jokes/etc throughout.  It was *much* better than listening to the actual TV broadcasters.  You just turn your radio to the frequency, mute the TV, and voila. 

So I'm thinking some of us could do something similar.  Really, the goal is to provide an alternate-listening-experience during the Super Bowl, but we'd need practice before attempting such a feat, so we'd use occasional regular season games for that.

Things I'm not entirely clear about -

1) How a small group of us could simultaneously transmit through some Internet-medium of some description from various locations.

2) How "live" it would be, or if the inherent Internet-mediumness would cause a delay that would make our announcing too out of synch.

3) Who would be a combination of funny enough, and also willing to give up hanging out with friends to watch the SB, in order to do this.  I hate my friends so I'm totally willing.  

I do have a friend who runs an ISP/website hoster, so I could get free (or really really cheap) hosting for at least some of the functions, depending on the answers to 1 and 2.  

Anyway, just tossing the idea out there.  Maybe it'll work, maybe too many hurdles.  (And yeah I know the NFL bans "descriptions" of the games so we might get shut down quickly, but if we keep our regular-season broadcasts limited to /r/NFL only...maybe it would survive long enough...)

Edit: currently googling for answers to 1 and 2.  Finding interesting results. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Methods tried (and abandoned, as none seem to work) - 

1) Close all windows/blinds during the day.  Open only at night (~9PM).  

2) Use one of those box-window-fans to blow hot air out.

3) Use one of those box-window-fans to blow cool air in.  

4) keep lower-level windows closed, keep upper-level windows open, to vent heat.  

None of it seems to make a difference.  Surely someone here knows the optimal method.

Edit : yeah yeah, "AC"; we're trying to find a more natural way to do this.  nohippies, just wondering. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just finished my first game. A few thoughts. (Semi-repost..and now I've finished a few more games.) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Deleted the original thread, because I became paranoid that I might be breaking the NDA.  Got approval from the mods, so here it is again.

Background - started playing DotA sometime around 2006ish.  Switched to HoN in 2010 or so.  Those are pretty much the only games I've played for the past few years.  But - I have played a handful of games in LoL and Smite as well.

* I like that this combines elements from almost each one of those games.  The shopping system is a lot like Smite, which I find is more intuitive/easier for noobs than HoN/DotA.  I also like the LoL-style feature of having two "extra" skills on top of the 4 unique to the character.

* Last hitting creeps was really, really difficult.  Maybe this is just getting used to attack animations.  I also just jumped right in before adjusting key-bindings (noob!).  But I didn't think it would be *that* hard to last hit.  

* I think the way-points (not sure the official name atm, but Wayne Tower and the Subway and whatever) should have some sort of defense mechanism.  Maybe not as difficult as HoN/DotA towers.  But my teammate and I could just run past the creeps and capture the waypoint with no bother while the enemy was busy elsewhere.  Maybe this is just part of the strategy of the game, I dunno, but it seemed a bit too easy.

* The graphics are freakin slick.  Well done.  Each Moba has a level of learning what spells from heroes look like.  But if you're even halfway familiar with the DC universe, it helps alleviate confusion a great deal.  "Oh, Green Lantern just dropped a jet on my head, that's why I died."  (As opposed to my first dozen games in HoN being like, "...what just happened...?")

* Mouse-over info on the endgame screen would be nice.  I have no idea what "Drones/Controls/Dest." means.  I can wager a guess, but I'm not sure.

* Also I couldn't seem to change my Shop list away from the "Recommended".  I'm sure this is something that will get changed, but while our team was totally kicking ass, I would have liked to explore different items (since I'm sure they would have done fine without me).

* New one here after playing more - the creeps in this game seem...kinda pointless...there just seems to be so much constant moving, spending a few seconds to take a control point then moving for a gank or another control point...it seems that laning in a traditional Moba is something you shouldn't really do in this game.  It just seems like a waste of time sorta.

All in all this looks impressive.  

And now to start my second match. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Discussion] On the Baroque Cycle/Neal Stephenson </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-19 06:15:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm curious as to others' thoughts on this series, and thought I'd post my own.

As a disclaimer of sorts - there are only two novels by Neal Stephenson that I have read less than three times - The Big U (which I just completed for the second time), and The System of the World, the final chapter of the Baroque Cycle, which I am currently working my second way through and which brings me to this post.

I love Stephenson's writing style, whichever form it takes.  From the zany/action-packed/Tarantino-esque "Snow Crash" to the plodding/pent-up/slow-accumulation of "Anathem", and most everything in between.  

But this third book ("System of the World") I am struggling with, for the reasons laid out below - 

1) It seems Stephenson decided he would create three ~1,000 page works and set out to achieve that goal, regardless of the pacing/style/"interestingness" of the work. 

2) I find myself skipping over large sections of this work because of that, which is something I very infrequently do.  I reach a point where I see that the next ~4 pages are simply long paragraphs describing what London/(insert setting) looked like at the time, or similar, and I ignore those parts until I start seeing quotes again, signifying a return to plot.

3) Even those parts with quotations/"plot" involved frequently seem to be large diversions simply to fill page numbers.  

My experience with the series is thus - 

Quicksilver - Read in it's entirety 3-4 times.  The long descriptions (that I find tiresome in "System of the World") contribute to the richness of the world.

The Confusion - Read it's entirety twice.  Read the Shaftoe/Waterhouse sections 2-3 more times, while skipping over most/all of the Eliza parts.  I suppose this is where the series started to lose me.  The Eliza parts are where I first felt that he was simply trying to fill in page numbers.

System of the World - Second time through, and already finding I'm skipping large sections.  By this point I really don't need two pages describing what a particular street looks like.  I've already grown quite accustomed to what ~1700's London is like.  An entire paragraph devoted to how a single alley is laid out seems wasteful, and there are many such paragraphs.  

Anyway, just wondering how others have approached/perceived this series.  Am I right in thinking he basically "wasted time" in overly-describing things to fill pages?  Or did you find it wasn't a big deal and still highly appreciated every word?   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dear Google Play Music : Regarding your "radio" function - you almost perfectly copied Pandora. Which is why I'm keeping Pandora. [x-post r/google] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-16 04:23:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The whole Spotify-esque features, I don't care so much for. I only really use these services while working, where I'm too busy to think about a specific album. So I look for good Internet radio.

I thought this new Play Music would be the solution. Pandora has many, many faults. (Note: I do use the paid service, not free.) And, basically, Play Music has the same problems as Pandora, except worse.

My problem with Pandora : basically, the station I put on plays the same playlist every time. I up-thumb a song, thinking maybe it means it will play more/different songs by that artist, but no. It just means it makes sure to play that same song every. single. day. to the point where I eventually down-thumb it, because I'm sick of it. But the thing is, at least it only plays that song once per day.

My problem with Play Music : It plays the same songs more than once per work-day. I heard several songs repeated within a six-hour period. (Yes my work day is eight hours, but I noticed the songs repeating within six hours.)

What's worse? At some point this really annoying song came on. I went to give it the big thumbs down to make sure I never heard it again. And guess what. I had already given it a thumbs down, yet there it was being played. The salt in the wound? About 20 minutes later, a song from the same album was being played which I then had to give a thumbs down to as well. I'd think that giving one song on the album a thumbs down might mean "I don't like these people, stop playing them" but apparently not.

Now, about the Spotify-esque feature of "whatever you want to listen to on demand". I had this one song in mind, Bandits by Buck65. I really, really wanted to hear this song. They have the previous album (2003, "Talkin Honkey Blues"), and later albums, but for whatever reason, they don't have that album (2004, "This Right Here Is"). So not only can they not copy Pandora correctly, they can't copy Spotify correctly either, apparently.

And finally, a feature of Pandora that always keeps me coming back - "Add variety." In a single station I can add Lemon Jelly, Beta Band, Skull Snaps, Nina Simone, Nillson, and have a nice, highly variable listening experience. Still haven't found an Internet radio app that does the same.

**TL;DR - Play Music still seems to be in a very, very beta stage, despite it launching "officially". They have some bugs to work out, and some features to add, before I'll even consider making a switch.** </TEXT>

2) I don't post here under this account, because I don't want people upvoting me just because I'm the mod.  That being said, I do post here using other accounts.

3) Generally speaking, I think most subreddits are best when left mostly hands-off.

<TEXT> So we've been trying to teach a friend's friend how to play.  So we're trying to feed them kills against bots to teach them basics.

I was rhapsody.  I used staccato on a few people, but I'd only use it once or twice to slow people down.  I wouldn't attack, I would literally take my hand of the keyboard so I didn't staccato again, and I would still always end up with the kill.  Or, often enough that the new girl's boyfriend would bitch me out for KSing.

I know creeps can get last hit and I can still be rewarded with the kill for doing most damage.  But still, it happened often enough it made me wonder about staccato.

So does one or more of the staccato charges automatically go off at the end of the time frame? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Atheist, so I don't really think the title, but...fuck.

I feel like if I write the whole history of the last two years I'll just get depressed and end up going to suicide watch.  So I'll just say the latest example since that's what has me upset enough to be here.

Start talking to a girl on OK Cupid.  We're hitting it off great.  I ask her out to coffee this past Sunday.  She says yes.

We meet.  We (as far as I could tell) had a great time.  Conversation flows smoothly and easily, we're both laughing frequently.  Tons of common interests.  We depart, "I'll talk to you soon," I say.  "I'd like that," she says.

I call today at 5:30.  She's getting her hair done, can I call back later?  I call at 7:30.  Rings twice, goes to voicemail.  A minute later, a text arrives.

"Hey subject4639.  Sorry about the weirdness earlier, I had a bunch of goop in my hair.

Anyway, I met a guy last week [ed: as in, before she went out with me] and I like him and think I'm going to pursue that.

But if you still wanted to be friends and stuff, I'd like that.  And sorry about texting, I'm just bad at doing this stuff over the phone."

All I'm left with is the feeling that she went out with me because she was hoping to "trade up" and for whatever reason I ended up with a lower score than the other guy.

And this is an example of about a dozen similar events that have happened in the past two years.  Not all relationship-related; two great jobs I was certain I would get only to find out I didn't (one because they "thought I was a great fit, but we feel we need a female presence in the office"), etc...

This is the toughest string of consecutive near-victories-turning-to-defeats I've ever gone through.  Every time the dice roll, they roll in someone else's favor.  I just can't get a break. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I get it, I'm just using the free mode, so there are ads.  But seriously, why can't they play them at the volume of the music, or hey, even just a tad bit quieter?  

Instead they're following the same BS model that has pissed everyone off about TV since the 80s.  I'm driving around, listening to music, and suddenly my speakers are nearly blown out by an ad for some insurance company or whatever.  

Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.

Edit: Since a bunch of people are making assumptions, a few being quite rude about it, to clarify a bit - I use (and pay) for Pandora at the moment.  But it's radio function has left me feeling pretty "blah."  You add a band to create a station, and then you hear the exact same songs every single f'ing day.  So I was **testing Spotify's radio to see if it was better.**  I don't particularly care for/need the ability to access any song I want at any time.  I just want a good radio app that plays a variety of music instead of (what seems to be the case with Pandora) a single playlist on shuffle.

<TITLE> Hypothetical - Say China, tired of North Korea constantly straining tensions, and fearful that an "incident" would lead to a US invasion, decides themselves to invade North Korea pre-emptively. What would be the likely fallout/repercussions? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-03 02:30:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To repeat the title with a little more info - 

1) China has more or less been forced to be an ally of North Korea.  During the Korean War, they seemed to happily embrace this stance.  Lately, they seem more and more upset at being placed in awkward situations due to the increasingly erratic behavior of DPRK.  

2) China fears there will be an incident, intentional or accidental, that will cause the US to invade, resulting in a strong US presence right against their Northern border, meaning a second potential front (as Taiwan provides a potential Southern front).

3) China decides to preemptively invade North Korea.  They argue the US didn't need permission from the UN to invade Iraq.  They argue they're trying to free an oppressed people from a diabolical leader in possession of WMD's, just like Iraq.  

What would be the likely outcome/reaction if this were to happen?  Or, in other words, could it feasibly work out for China?  

I imagine it's doubtful the US would declare war over such an act.  I imagine the US would complain a lot, "sovereign rights (even if acting insane)" and so on.  China would also now have a "buffer State" similar to the USSR/Eastern Europe post-WW2.  

Would it make sense for China to do something like this?   </TEXT>

But...when searching, I see the final score of the match.  So there's little point in watching the game because I know the final outcome.  

I figure it wouldn't be that big of an adjustment to make.  

For instance, searching "uefa champions league", you include a nifty schedule of recent and upcoming matches.  The recent matches include the final scores. In place of the scores, just include a little button that says "Show Result" for those games?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> One small change would have made a world of difference in these scenes.  

If she would have kept trying to get the pliers *while* talking to Milton.  

Instead, she stops to talk to him, stops to talk to see if he's dead.  This is just so utterly unbelievable, that someone would risk their life just to talk.  

And that, to me, sums up my frustrations with the show itself, in general.  

If, like in the comic, very minor comic spoiler[](/c "they were doing things like planting gardens,") and talking while doing that, that's one thing.  Instead, they do literally nothing while talking.  Countless other examples of the same.  

My problem with the show isn't that there's non-stop zombie killing hoorah!  Character development is fine.  But you can have characters DO THINGS while talking, like for instance, saving their fucking life when they know someone is about to become a zombie.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> I still disagree with the loss of random gold in AP. But how about this change to AR? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-31 06:57:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, so in AP if you random you don't get extra gold.  As stated in the title, I think this is lame.  

But if you're going to do that, what about this...

In AR, let one person per team allow for an AP pick - but, they end up with repick gold.  

As in - you're playing AR, you random the team of 5 int squishies and you're in desperate need of a tank.  Right now, your only option is repick and *hope* you get a tank/carry/whatever.  

What if you let one person per team choose their pick, in AR only, but they end up with the same amount of gold as if they repicked?  Maybe you're the 5 melee team and want to repick into Bubbles or something...sure, but only 453 gold.   Or as I said earlier, the 5 intel team and you want a tank.  Sure you can repick and choose Devo, but only 453 gold.  

**TL;DR** - Allow a chosen repick in AR mode, as opposed to a random repick, but get stuck with less gold a la normal repick.  

Edit for some clarity - my response to a comment that's been deleted - "I was trying to say (and I've had a bit to drink so sorry for being confusing) - only a single person can choose their repick.  I guess whomever comes first.  If a second person repicks, they random their repick just like it is now, and lose the same amount of gold.  " </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think I'll probably do a poor job of summarizing his arguments but I'll try my best.  

1) You have a guaranteed amount of damage, which is fairly high early game.  Later game, the +24 damage might not be comparable to the potential scaling of the str/agi/int boost from steamboots.  But early game, +24 damage, it's way over powered.  

Edit: 1b) How does the scaling of steamboots compare to the +24 damage of ghost marchers?  Let's say Flux at level 8 versus Flux at level 25?  How much damage output is the steamboots/GM difference going to be?

2) The phasing effect.  You can escape/chase way better than any other boots.  

3) TP boots are awesome, but too expensive.  Armor Boots would be cool if they applied to heroes, but they only apply to creeps.  

Because of these bits of info, I find myself buying ghost marchers on practically every single character.  With the occasional exception of blink characters (since they don't need the speed boost for chasing). 

So can you explain why for the characters, let's say....Mage Bane, Predator, Torturer, and Bramble...why would Steam Boots be preferable to Ghost Marchers, or vice versa?  Other character examples? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The reason we haven't been visited by "aliens".  And the reason we won't be any time soon.   </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-05 05:16:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Aliens will never contact us until we can prove we have evolved past war and become a single, unified, peaceful species. They know about us, there are probably cloaked transmitters the size of a dime floating in space keeping tabs.

Why do they require us to be peaceful? Here's the thought-experiment that led me to this conclusion -

Two planets, Alpha and Beta. Think of them like Earth and Mars, except both have intelligent life at the same stages of evolution, where we're at now. Which means, maybe they get along peacefully most of the time, but they don't trust each other. War will come.

So, Beta has received intel that Alpha is going to attack them. Beta decides to launch a pre-emptive strike. They're going to send 10,000 nuclear warheads at us. They paint them black, create a propulsion system that doesn't leave an obvious trail. Stealth Nukes, that Alpha has no idea about until, whoops, all of Alpha has been nuked to cinders.

Now into this scenario we insert a temporal vortex thingamajig. Time gets rewound 20 years. Except, everyone on both planets has memories of what just occurred.

So Alpha litters their orbits with high-tech sensors which can detect the nukes. Alpha can now safely detect and destroy any of the incoming missiles from Beta. Beta sets up their own similar network, thinking Alpha might try the same trick. But, Alpha, knowing Beta just nuked them, goes with a different strategy. They send a "peace delegation" to Beta. The 5 delegates each carry a component, seemingly innocent on it's own, but when combined create a biological weapon that will entirely destroy Beta's population. They do just that.

Time paradox thingamajig again. Both sides learn from that, develop new defenses. Beta's turn; they send a 100 mile diameter asteroid at Alpha - so large none of Alpha's weapons can destroy it. Alpha is wiped out.
Time paradox thingamajig. Alpha creates a weapon that can cause a mini-black hole. Beta is destroyed. Thingamajig. Beta causes a solar flare that doesn't harm them but destroys the atmosphere of Alpha. Thingamajig. Alpha figures out how to freeze all of Beta's oceans in an instant. Beta is uninhabitable in a week. Thingamajig. On and on in this vein.

The point is - there is **no defense of a planet possible in space warfare.** No matter what kind of defenses you imagine against whatever possible threat you can think of, a determined enemy can figure out something you haven't prepared for, and destroy you that way. Even if your planet is perfectly defensed (impossible, imo, but we'll run with the idea), then fine, they'll destroy your sun.

Warfaring species cannot exist. Maybe they're allowed to explore their own solar system, but I'm certain that if the alien overlords discover an antagonistic species is developing interstellar capability, they'll make their presence known only for the purpose of containing that species from the rest of the galaxy. Destroying most of the population so they return to tribal/basic civilization. Containing the planet in an unbreakable shell, ensuring they lack the resources to leave the planet. Something.

And, if a species shows they are unified and peaceful, and have developed interstellar capability, then and only then are they allowed to join the galactic brotherhood.

**TL;DR - It's too easy to wipe out planets, even with the puny technology we have now. Evolved species monitor potential aliens like us, and if we've proved we've evolved beyond warfare, they allow us to join the galaxy. If we're still violent/antagonistic, they make sure we stay in our own tiny solar system.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> For fellow r/NFL'ers who have Game Rewind - each Sunday we are going to watch the best game of the week during the regular season. Continuing with Week 2 this Sunday. Edit for clarity : I'll create a game thread this Sunday about an hour before the "start" of the game.

So post the Week 2 matchup you most want to see here. Whichever receives the most upvotes is the game we will all rewatch together.

**Also, please note** - Include which type of broadcast you prefer.  Some want the All 22, some want the condensed, some want the normal broadcast.  I think normal broadcast is best, so people can watch youtube/torrents, but that's me.

As a reminder, the Week 2 games eligible for voting are - 

Chicago Bears vs. Green Bay Packers  
Oakland Raiders vs. Miami Dolphins  
Cleveland Browns vs. Cincinnati Bengals  
Kansas City Chiefs vs. Buffalo Bills  
New Orleans Saints vs. Carolina Panthers  
Baltimore Ravens vs. Philadelphia Eagles  
Houston Texans vs. Jacksonville Jaguars  
Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. New York Giants  
Minnesota Vikings vs. Indianapolis Colts  
Arizona Cardinals vs. New England Patriots  
Dallas Cowboys vs. Seattle Seahawks  
Washington Redskins vs. St. Louis Rams  
New York Jets vs. Pittsburgh Steelers  
Tennessee Titans vs. San Diego Chargers

<TEXT> A few details - 

I always go to sleep on my side, and most nights she'll sleep up near my head, using my arm as a pillow.  Sometimes she'll sleep behind my legs, in the roughly 110 degree angle formed by my thighs/calves.  These are the nights in question.  Before crawling over my legs to sleep there, she reaches out a paw and gently pats my junk.

It's reached the point where any time I can tell she's going to sleep behind my legs, I use one hand to cover myself.  But once in awhile I'm on the verge of sleep or forget or whatever, and sure enough, *tap!*

No claws are involved.  And the shock of it always makes me immediately react which makes her stop.  So I'm not exactly sure what she would do if I didn't intervene.  Nor am I curious to find out.  

It's happened after days where I fall asleep in the same underwear I've been wearing all day, and days where I've showered and changed before getting into bed, so no, I don't believe it's a smell thing.  (Jerks.)

Oh, and I'm apparently supposed to include a picture of  her, so [here she is using my arm as a pillow](http://i.imgur.com/Wf5aO.jpg) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quick recap of what this is - for /r/NFL folk who have Game Rewind, we're going to be rewatching the best game of each week.  I'll create voting threads on the Thursday before ( [this past week's](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/18k4tp/season_rewind_rewatching_the_best_game_of_each/) ) and whichever game gets the most upvotes is the one we watch.  

At 2PM EST we all click play and watch the game together.  (Google "what time is it" for a common reference point.)

<TITLE> [Season Rewind] - Rewatching the best game of each week.  Week 1 voting thread.   </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-15 03:58:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For fellow r/NFL'ers who have Game Rewind - each Sunday we are going to watch the best game of the week during the regular season.  Starting with Week 1 this Sunday.  Edit for clarity : I'll create a game thread this Sunday about an hour before the "start" of the game.  

So post the Week 1 matchup you most want to see here.  Whichever receives the most upvotes is the game we will all rewatch together. 

As for the watching itself, I'm open to suggestions.  I was thinking maybe a 2PM EST starting time, so more people can participate?  Not too early for West Coasters, not too late that East Coasters miss dinner?  Similarly, as another commenter pointed out, should we watch the "normal" view, or the All-22 view, or the "Condensed" View, etc.  I would say the "Normal" view for the first few weeks as we first understand how this operates. (Hey I'm just as new to this idea as you all are.)

A recap of the Week 1 games for nomination - 

Dallas Cowboys vs. New York Giants  
Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Minnesota Vikings  
Miami Dolphins vs. Houston Texans  
Buffalo Bills vs. New York Jets	  
New England Patriots vs. Tennessee Titans  
Indianapolis Colts vs. Chicago Bears  
Atlanta Falcons vs. Kansas City Chiefs  
Philadelphia Eagles vs. Cleveland Browns  
St. Louis Rams vs. Detroit Lions  
Washington Redskins vs. New Orleans Saints  
San Francisco 49ers vs. Green Bay Packers  
Seattle Seahawks vs. Arizona Cardinals  
Carolina Panthers vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers  
Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Denver Broncos  
Cincinnati Bengals vs. Baltimore Ravens  
San Diego Chargers vs. Oakland Raiders </TEXT>

<TITLE> I guess I'm beating a dead horse here - but with HoN 3.0 and the "Learnatorium", it fails in quite a few ways. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-10 08:07:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First - why aren't items included in the Learnatorium?  There's no easy way to look up items except in-game. Items are basically as important as the heroes themselves, and some descriptions are somewhat vague.  

Second - why isn't there more detail than the general hero description?  What I mean is, in the picking stage, if you mouseover a hero it gives you a description of each skill.  But many of these descriptions are lacking somewhat key elements.  Some mention the casting speed, most don't.  I understand it's safe to assume that "Lifesteal" means per damage inflicted, but Predator's Lifesteal is based on HP of enemy.  Maybe it seems redundant to some people, but for me (and probably noobs) it would be nice to understand the differences.  Lord Salforis's first spell, for instance - the description says "causes damage after *some* time".  His passive gives you a X% Lifesteal, and it seems like it's obviously damage.  But maybe it would be nice to know that before using the character.  

Third - or perhaps 2B, the skills in the Learnatorium are only described at their max capabilities.  It doesn't show each level.  C'mon.  It's the *Learn*atorium, it should be teaching you everything.  

I guess the basic point is - the Learnatorium should be a valuable resource to all players, new or experienced.  You play Salf enough, you "just know" how long his first skill takes to go off.  but ask one of you in person and the response will be "I dunno, it takes 1, maybe 1 and 1/2 seconds..."   </TEXT>

<TITLE> The thread in which we discuss new town ideas for the next rev.   </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-31 06:44:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was asking in chat whether there was an "official" thread for this and mattman kindly told me that no, typically this subreddit was flooded with various posts/ideas around new rev time.  So I thought maybe we could condense some ideas here?

I've had a few ideas - 

1) Rose City, the current city I'm mayor of.  The original idea was little more than "build lots of bridges, and plant lots of roses." We've come up with some new ideas/refinements. 

2) As noted in the terrain-ideas thread, I had some vague notions of starting a town in a very cliffy area, where all the buildings were carved into the cliffs, balconies, etc.  But I've been doing a test build near Wellspring and...it's not working out so...well.

3) Inspired by a recent /r/minecraft post, now I really really would like to found "Tuscany" - [here is the post that inspired](http://imgur.com/a/H6uk3#0) - white buildings with brick roofs, wood accents.  Or maybe a "Euro Villa" town to make it a little broader, and allow for traditional Greek/French/etc building styles.   </TEXT>

Games I play/have played a lot and enjoy - Skyrim, Minecraft, Dota2/Heroes of Newerth, Civilization.


Games I've played recently but haven't been able to get into - EVE (too tedious), Natural Selection (meh), Planetside 2 (meh), Diablo 3 (anti-climatic).

There are just so many games out there I don't know where to begin.  If an RPG, I don't want just any RPG, I want there to be some sort of unique...something...about it.

FPS's don't hold my attention for very long.

Does that mean you can only use that item in a single game?  

Then when I go to that bundle details, I see I can buy the items individually.  Except there's no warning about "limited use" for the individual items.  

Sorry, last time I played DotA2, this store didn't exist.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> On PvE server - 

1) Eggs are broken.  I try throwing an egg to hatch a chicken, the egg just pops back into my inventory.

2) Bows and/or arrows are broken.  I haven't tried this personally, but was just seeing Weazol and Fraakan talking about it.  Arrows decrease in your inventory, but don't actually get shot.

3) Manually-opened doors are broken, if holding certain items.  When an egg or a bow is the active item, the door just closes again.  Also doors that require a button to open have the same issue, the button depresses but the door doesn't open.  Switch to a dirt block (or whatever), and manual/button doors open fine.  

4) Actually, it seems some (but not all) right-click action items are what are causing the problems.  Just tried opening a chest with an egg as my active item, and the chest doesn't open.  Ender pearls and fire charges work fine for opening doors/chests.  Snowballs have this problem.  Fishing rods have this problem.  Flint and steel doesn't. 

Maybe the haxoring to enable PvP messed things up?

<DATE> 2012-12-15 15:15:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, it's officially the next day so I can talk about this. Why is it every time some tragedy like yesterday's occurs, it's never about the guns, it's about mental health? Columbine? Mental health. Little Rock? Mental health. LA, Aurora, Clackamas, Connecticut? Mental health.  (The saddest part of this is I can't even remember every instance of a tragedy like this, because it happens so often.) And where has that gotten us? Precisely nowhere. The brain is an incredibly complex and intricate mechanism. We could pour billions of dollars per year at it for the next 100 years and still understand only a fraction of what the brain is and how it works. Guns? Guns are fucking easy; to understand, to legislate, to control. Yeah, people can go crazy with knives or bow and arrow or their car, but how about taking away the *easiest* option from them? This isn't the time for division/opinion? Fuck that. With the gun nuts, it's never time. How is this NOT the time? "We should just come together", yeah, the problem with that is, one side refuses to even budge from their corner, with their fingers in the ears yelling "NAH NAH NAH CAN'T HEAR YOU NAH NAH NAH!" It's easier to get a gun than a car, and there is ONE and ONLY ONE purpose to a gun - to kill things. You say you only use your gun to shoot cans and bottles? Yeah, and you take great joy in the fact you caused massive destruction to cans and bottles. You "killed" the cans and bottles, and took pleasure in it. You can say its purported reason is "self defense" or to "defend yourself from the government" or whatever the fuck else you can come up with, but in every instance the reason to own the gun? TO KILL SOMETHING. Wait, that's not even partially correct. It's not the kill someTHING. It's to kill someONE. You wanna hide behind the Second Amendment? Fine. Make it possible to own a gun. But make it extremely fucking difficult to do so. Set up ammo centers where all your ammunition is stored and you have to go check out in order to use. Make it so I can't walk into Big R at 7AM, plop down less money than an X-Box costs, and walk out with the ability to take nine lives. I'm tired of the Left in this country cowing down on this issue when little fucking children are being gunned down. </TEXT>

I was at level 27 and wanted to reach 30 to enchant a pick, but didn't want to travel all the way to The End or any of that.  So I was running around killing all the mobs that spawned at night.  

I found one infected villager, and I lured him into the Walla Walla Inn and fenced him in.  I'd never cured a zombie before, or even knew how it was done.  So by the time I read up on it, created a Brewing Stand (located in the library, opposite the enchantment room) and brewed all the necessary ingredients, the infected zombie was gone. 

I decided I wouldn't sleep until I cured an infected zombie.  

Now to find Wallette, so we can have us a nice lil village. </TEXT>

(Original text) - Regarding the "hotel" areas -

In the Basic rooms - spend the night, rejuvenate, hide from skele's until the sun rises.

The Deluxe rooms - public chests included, store whatever you want there while you're in town.

The Penthouse Suite - When you're in the room there are two chests, one to the left of the door and one to the right. In the left chest I've included basic crafting items and some iron tools. Feel free to use them, and return them in whatever state. (Note: Nicer items will be there soon, but I've been busy making this tower and I'm still fairly new to this server/MC in general.) In the right chest is where you can place your "payment" for staying the night/using the items. Preferred methods of payment : books, quills, leather (these for helping the Church of the Broadcast), any other blocks you deem valuable.
Hope you enjoy!

<TITLE> [Mostly discussion, semi-suggestion] Chairs.  Everyone wants them.  But why? Just to sit and stare?  I have an idea, and I'm wondering what yours may be.   </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-04 05:16:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So people love building "chairs" in MC, and people often complain that you can't actually sit in the chair.  Well...why would you want to?  You really just want to sit in a chair in your room and do nothing but sit?  

I understand it adds (a bit) to the realism.  But it doesn't really seem all that necessary of a function, since at least personally, I'd rather be off building/mining/etc. rather than just sit.  (Granted, it would be nice to just sit and admire your surroundings from time to time. But building functional chairs for such a brief/minimal enjoyment is asking a lot.)

My idea - mini-games.  

If two chairs are set up opposite one another, and two players sit opposite one another, they can play a mini-game between them.  The games don't have to be anything fancy - connect-four, tic-tac-toe, things of that nature.  

Tic-Tac-Toe - if a crafting table is set up in between the two chairs, use the crafting area as the gameplay area.  The X's are cobblestone, the O's are dirt.  If you lose, the winner is able to take a single item from your non-queued items. (i.e. something in your "backpack" but not something in your 1-9 items.)

Connect-Four - if a double-chest is set up between two chairs, you can play Connect-Four, using the double-chest as your game surface.  Same winner/loser rules as above.  

Edit: I mentioned this in a few comments but thought I'd add it to the OP - I understand there's a specific suggestion subreddit.  Usable chairs have been suggested many times.  The point of this post wasn't to get across my suggestion alone, but see what ideas people had in general.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about sheep that the wiki/discussions/etc. don't seem to have an answer for.  Do sheared sheep eat grass/regrow wool faster under direct sunlight? And/or with a nearby water source? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-04 04:04:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been playing on the reddit PVE server, and the Walla Walla farm has some sheep in a pen.  I need a lot of wool.  So I breed the two sheep into six, sheer sheer sheer, then reduce back to two sheep.  

The problem I have is, the sheep take a really, really long time to eat grass/regrow their wool.  In my single player worlds, my sheep would typically eat grass/regrow almost instantaneously.

Our sheep pen is under some cliffs/hidden from direct light.  Also, there's no water source nearby.  

I'm wondering if these are factors in how quickly sheep eat grass/regrow.  If there's water and/or direct sun, do they eat faster?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't have to be instantaneous.  Whether it's after each set of games are played, or at the end of every game except Sunday Night, or at the end of Sunday period, or whatever; I'd be happy to see the scores easily listed on my most-often visited NFL site.  

I know the scores are listed in the bottom ticker of games, and halftime highlights.  But, for instance, I was working all day today, and certain games I don't particularly care about (because they don't concern my playoff cares), I remember the victor but not the score.  

And I'm left visiting (*shudder*) NFL.com or something in order to see the scores.  

What brought this up was seeing the story about Sanchez being benched that's currently one of the top links, but the story was written in the middle of the third quarter and was left with "the score is currently 7-3."  I know the Jets won, but can't at all recall the final score.  

Just seems like something not all that difficult to pull off with 13 mods and all.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> The problem/non-problem with the "B.S." rule the cost the Lions the game </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-26 07:49:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This came up watching the Bears' game earlier today.  There was a certain play that seemed obviously B.S. to anyone watching on TV.  Because it was a turnover, it was reviewed.  

After a short review, the refs came back on the field and said the play stood.  However, because of some on-field issue (injury or something), more time was allowed...and about 30 seconds later, the refs came back and said the play was under review...even though they had just said the play stood as called.  

This seems like precisely the sort of situation the "bullshit" rule that screwed over the Lions was intended to prevent.  Throw in the fact that another review in the Chargers/Ravens game took *nine* minutes to reach a conclusion...

I can see now why, at least in theory, this rule was created in the first place.

It just leaves me wondering, why not set a mandated amount of time for a review?  Give every single review a minimum/maximum of a minute and thirty seconds.  Otherwise, has the replay booth been given enough time to review every angle from every camera?  And even if they have, maybe it's just time to make a fucking decision and make a call, and not take nine minutes to do so.   </TEXT>

Edit: I didn't even realize that was Beiber with the PM until the fifth meme about it reached the top.  I thought it was just some random Saskatchewan yokel who saved some Boy Scouts from a polar bear or something.

<TEXT> I have Pandora on at work, with a range of 60s funk/jazz to modern Electronic/Rock type stuff.  Too often I have to run to the back of the shop to adjust the volume one way or another.  Pandora can't compress/normalize, most mp3 players can't compress/normalize, most computer music players, TV, movies that go from ultra-soft whispering to ultra-loud explosions...

I have general knowledge behind audio engineering, so I understand concepts like compression and whatnot.  

It just seems crazy to me that this shit is still so difficult to achieve.  Why can't my mp3 player look at my songs and go X% is the volume, adjust everything accordingly? </TEXT>

<TEXT> RE: 49'ers QB controversy

Would Peyton Manning really have "worked" with the 49ers?  His style of game is so different, and between he and Harbaugh the egos are so strong...the "obvious" answer is "oh the 49ers are so great, if they had Manning they'd obviously be even better!" But is that necessarily the case?

RE: Jason Campbell

When I (only a few weeks ago) found out Jason Campbell was the backup for Cutler, I was surprised and thought, "Well if Cutler goes down, things could be much worse than Campbell."  After last night, not so sure.  Hell, even Cutler's numbers were frequently awful and the defense was the main producer; would a different backup really have done much better?

RE: Fig Newton

Newton's numbers and decisions look awful this year.  So did Freeman's last year, whereas his first and third year (so far) look pretty damn good.  I think Newton will bounce back next year, like Freeman this year.  I haven't watched the Panthers much, but it seems their problems lay more in the coaches-area than the players-area.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a Droid X (original).  I love it to death, and really fear the day I'll have to upgrade.  I've never had any problems with it; didn't have to replace it, everything worked as fine as expected.  Sure it was a little slow, but the hardware is a little slow, so whatever.

But lately it seems like every month or so, when I update all my apps, at least one more app becomes almost useless.  I have a feeling it's because my device is now way down the list on the "check compatibility" list.  I'm also wondering if it's due to apps being created/optimized for dual core systems and things of that nature.  

It started with Lithium, my favorite music player.  A few months ago, it picked up the habit of occasionally ceasing to play music.  It's not paused, and it's not really "frozen" because I can still go back to the menu and select another song, but when I do...nothing happens.  I have to kill the task and restart Lithium, and then it will work again.  

The most recent is Mozilla.  The problems have become so bad I switched to SkyFire.  Similar to Lithium, I'd click a link, the page would start loading and then...nothing.  In Firefox's case, it really was frozen; trying to click "back" or a different link, nothing would happen until eventually "Firefox has stopped responding - force close or wait?"

Maybe it is just the hardware starting to show its age, but I feel like it's more-so that I'm being "forced" to upgrade so the software runs correctly.  

Bah, I guess I'm just sad I have to give up this phone.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Speculation and SPOILERS up to current episode] Would the group have been better off if Rick had never found them? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-14 02:17:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In S1E2 - Rick starts off getting the group into trouble simply by being found by the group.  They were originally there for a quick grab-and-run of supplies, and they allude to things going perfectly until Rick shows up.  Who's to say things wouldn't have gone swimmingly, until Rick arrived on the scene?

Now, from this point on, things would be *entirely* different, so it's incredibly speculative, but continuing on...

Merle, the first "victim" of Rick.  Now, Merle has some problems, he's a bit of an asshole, but as we've seen recently he can be kinda allright, and there's a good chance Daryl (who seems pretty dang honorable) would have been able to keep him in check.

When the camp is attacked, there are two points - one, I thought it was somewhat hinted at that, because of Merle being left behind, he may have been responsible for leading a group of walkers to the camp.  Second, as Shane suggests, if Rick and all had been at the camp instead of trying to free Merle, there may have been fewer/no casualties.  

Then he talks them into returning to Atlanta, to the CDC.  This results directly in another member of the group dying, a hugely devastating blow to morale in general, and fleeing without a purpose or base camp.

Shane would most likely have stayed sane without the pressure of Lori/his possible child/so on...

The search for Sofia - another fruitless endeavor, another blow to morale, and in many ways responsible for the deaths/scattering that ended Season 2.

I could go on, but I guess to drop the hypotheticals that followed and return to the beginning - would the group have been better off staying at their camp at the quarry, with Rick never having found them? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey r/music.  This is an idea I had a decade ago that I still think has potential, though there are also some big flaws.  What are your thoughts on creating, essentially, a band stock market? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-10 05:03:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was in two groups in 2001-2003, and as is often the case with garage bands, we wanted to release albums but most of us were struggling just to get by, let alone throw in money to make an album.

We did eventually manage to produce and release two albums.  But I digress.

The point is, during this time I had the crazy idea of, "Why isn't there a stock market system for bands?"  Now that things like Kickstarter are around, it seems more viable, though there are still some obvious problems.  

Basically, the band states it's goal - we want to produce 1,000 copies of a CD, which would cost $3,000 dollars.  If you chip in $100, or 3% of the cost, you'll receive a free copy of the CD, and...well that's where things get confusing and I'm hoping some of you have ideas to make it more viable.

With a 3% investment, maybe they get a 0.3% return on profits?  i.e. the person paid $100 for a 3% investment; if all 1,000 copies are sold at $16 per CD, that's $16,000 gross profit, so the investor receives $480.  

And there's the problem that maybe you invest, but the band experiences "creative differences" and breaks up.  But then again, in the actual stock market, people make bad investments all the time, so...is that such a big deal?  

Anyway, I just thought it was time to throw the idea out there and see what comes of it.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are you a fan of the author Neal Stephenson?  Myself and another redditor believe many of his novels are contained within the same universe.   </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-09 04:23:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The specific novels involved are Cryptonomicon, the Baroque Cycle series, Snow Crash, Zodiac, Diamond Age, and possibly Reamde and Anathem.  

These novels take place in (respectively); ~1940-1945 and 1999ish, ~1680-1750ish, 2020ish, 1998ish, somewhere between 2050-2080ish, and current day and 2100ish.  Many of the novels don't state explicit dates, so I apologize for the vagueness.  

Myself and xrelaht [his comments that inspired this thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12u65p/its_not_often_i_read_a_1000_page_book_for_the/c6ymbmv?context=3) believe all of these novels exist in the same universe for the following reasons (that link leads to the reasons, but to explain them here) -

1) First, nothing in any novel inherently counters another novel's "universe" from existing.  For a random instance, there isn't a mention of, say, London being nuked, while another novel has London still existing.  There are no preclusions.  

2a) There are specific examples, primarily identified by xrehalt - in the Diamond Age, a very elderly woman mentions she was a "thrasher" when she was younger; Y.T. in Snow Crash is known as a thrasher.  Perhaps the two characters are the same?

2b) In Reamde, a character refers to an inflatable boat as a "zodiac", which isn't a common term for such a thing; however, in his novel Zodiac, inflatable boats are frequently used.

3a) More vaguely related; China.  In Cryptonomicon, the threat of China is somewhat vague but certain - China is a "scary" enemy.  In Snow Crash (a few decades later), China is somewhat more serious of a threat. In the Diamond Age, China is basically THE big player, aside from the US/UK alliance.

3b) Cryptonomicon involves the creation of a legitimate digital currency.  Such a thing could easily lead to the economic problems (hyper-inflation) in Snow Crash. 

3c) Similarly, Snow Crash involves a pretty liberal/"free" society; the Diamond Age features a Neo-Victorian society.  Often times, one generation/society is created from the reaction to the previous generation/society.  Thus, the Neo-Victorian attitudes in Diamond Age are more easily understood, as they're a backlash to the ultra-freedom in Snow Crash.

The only novels to take place in a remotely similar period of time are Zodiac and Reamde, and parts of Cryptonomicon - and again, none of these make reference to something that obviously precludes them from sharing the same universe.  Considering all the novels, they span a roughly ~600 year period, but still none of them entirely cancel another's from existing in the same "earth".   </TEXT>

<TITLE> It's not often I read a 1,000 page book for the seventh time.  When I do, I decide to recommend it here.  Cryptonomicon, by Neal Stephenson. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I simply can't get over how damn good this book is.  Like most great things, it's very difficult to describe.  It's fiction, except, it's also non-fiction.  It's kinda sci-fi, except the sci-fi parts are set in (at the time of publication) "modern" day.  It's funny as all hell, while also being incredibly informative.  

There are three main story-lines, with a few others that spring up later - one set in World War 2, following a math genius and Nazi code-breaking; another set in World War 2, the jarhead Marine whose duty is to make SNAFU's look normal (while kicking ass along the way); and the final a modern day character attempting to...well...I don't want to spoil things.  

Being the seventh time through, I'd expect the jokes to be stale and the story so well-known as to be boring, but that just isn't the case.  I'm still laughing hard every few pages, and intensely following each chapter even though I know what's to come.

I suggest 9PM EST so West Coast folk can participate.  A lot of episode discussion threads (for any show) start with the East Coast viewing time, meaning West Coasters can't join in.  If enough Westies would prefer a 7PM start, pushing it back to 10PM EST, and the Easties don't mind...

**NOTE** Since this is a *re-watch* thread, it means you can pretty much guarantee there will be spoilers.  If you haven't watched the series before, it is recommended you *not* participate.

Um...well I guess that's it really.

<TEXT> Hoping to crack 1600 tonight.  

As a bit of back story, I stopped playing hon for 2-3 months, started up again.  Lots of new heroes and a few new items.  My account was 1520ish when I started again, dropped to 1490 while re-learning everything.  Not the highest I've ever been, but feeling good.

My few ideas -

1) How about throwing in extra silver coins for unpopular game modes?  AR is usually at least a 5 min queue, very often a 12 min queue.  I don't mind all that much, I just browse reddit while waiting.  But how about throwing a little extra incentive for unpopular modes?

2) In SD, why can't I see character info when mousing over other players possible selections?  If they shadow pick/pick a char, then I can mouse over and get info.  When I occasionally choose SD to play (for a shorter queue), I'm sometimes left asking, "I'll swap for...that one guy on the far right...Ravenor?  Or is it Prophet...?"  Semi-discouraging for noobs/casual players.

3) Okay this one is probably trickier to implement - but in AP, if someone afks/dc's and gets a random hero, how about making their "random" pick be the character they play the most often?  That way the rest of the team can at least kinda plan their picks and make a good team around the "random" pick.  Right now, it's kinda punishing the whole team because one person wasn't around for whatever reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the end of last season I wrote to Nick Canepa.  I moved away from SD a few years ago, but I still read the Union Tribune articles online.  I was either using a different email account at the time, or I just deleted the emails from disgust.  But my initial email went something like this - 

"During the past few horribly disappointing seasons, I've seen you blame almost every player on the team.  You blame Rivers for throwing INT's, you blame Matthews for fumbling or LT for being too old, you blame the WR's for not showing up, you blame the D-Line for not getting enough pressure, you blame the Safeties and CB's for being almost invisible.  Not once have I seen you blame Norv.  Guess what?  When the entire team is to blame, it's no longer the fault of the players, it's the fault of the coach.  The only thing I can figure is you already have a house in LA and you're trying to help the team move there so you can get a new job at the LA Tribune."

His response was 2-3 sentences, I can't remember exactly what, except for the one sentence - "Look, it's not my job to get a guy fired."

I replied again (receiving no response this time) - "It's not your job to get someone fired.  It IS very much your job to hold someone accountable.  Look at how the media in NY treats Coughlin.  You don't think the pressure placed on him makes him coach harder, hold his players more accountable?"

And of course, Canepa is far from the only one to blame.

This all comes up because of the boltsfromtheblue.com post about firing Norv.  One of the sentences is, "I never thought I'd say this, but the Chargers need to fire Norv."  

Really?  You *never* thought you'd say that?  Even after the past two horrible stenches of seasons?  

The SD media, to me, is plenty culpable in this whole fiasco.  They've continued to act as the unofficial mouth-piece of AJ Smith and flat out refuse to do their job - speak the truth, point out the flaws, hold people accountable.  

If the SD media had half the backbone of the NY media (or Pitt, or Balt, or NE, or many others), Norv would have been fired two or three years ago and we might have a decent coach by now.  

Instead, Norv will be fired (probably not) in mid-season, we'll have an interim coach who will struggle through the middle of next season, and by the time we have a good coach with a strong mindset, Rivers will be too old and/or to worn out, and it will be complete rebuilding mode.  

From here, it looks like 5-6 years (at least) before the Chargers will be considered a dangerous post-season contender again.  In part thanks to the media being soft and not speaking up for change years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was rewatching some games from the past two nights, and two in particular (both involving the Texans) made me wonder.

In the GBvHOU game, why was Rodgers still playing so late and with such a lead?  

In the HOUvBAL game, same question with Schaub. 

Now, I understand very well that leads can disappear, having watched the SDvDEN game.  And I only just realized this maybe sounds like some sort of advocacy for Tebow, which it very much isn't.

I just wonder, say a team is up 21 to 7 in the second quarter, why not throw in the backup for a few snaps, even if it's just one snap per drive to confuse the defense.  Yeah, that one snap might lead to one pick six and it's 21-14.  But with injuries so common, why not give the #2 a few more reps with the #1 offense?  

I understand the potential downside (pick six or strip sack or similar) is probably greater than the potential upside (backups aren't used that often), but I'm not certain that's really all that true.  Occasionally there's a Cassell who wins 11 games (but still misses the playoffs), but more often it's not, and fans/media/teams just say "well it was our backup QB so of course we were likely to lose." </TEXT>

<TITLE> I was told to come here.  By 2020, the NFL should have a Lunar Bowl. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-24 05:17:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay okay, hear me out.

The NFL as an organization makes roughly $6 billion per year. Put half that aside for the next eight years, and that means $24 billion able to be spent on a Lunar Pro Bowl by 2020.
Virgin Galactic currently offers ticket prices of $200k for a trip into the upper atmosphere.

Now, let's say there's a push, and Virgin Galactic decides to make a shuttle that can reach the moon and return. Let's say it even quintuples the price of the ticket for an even $1 million. That's enough for 24,000 people to visit the moon, definitely enough money to visit the moon. Even with prices increased to $5million per ticket, that could get around 4,000 people to the Moon, more than enough for the teams and all the production staff.

Advertising? What better venue? 111 million people watched the last Super Bowl. The first game held in space?! You must be looking at close to 3 billion viewers, at least.

Tie-ins? If just McDonalds builds a restaurant on the Moon to feed the players, that's some major advertising revenue. You thought Super Bowl advertising revenue was crazy? How about the first game on the motherfucking moon?  If the NFL were serious about this, don't you think the government/NASA might want to chip in, to show what a badass nation we are?  NBC chips in a few hundred million per year for TV rights, that helps build the dome they play in.  (Along with NASA and all the other advertisers).  Nike chips in a few hundred million per year to design the uniforms/suits.  

2020, enough time for Virgin to develop a moon-capable vehicle, and all the advertising money that would generate. The NFL only needs to set aside half their yearly profits. Then throw in the money from every other company wanting to get in on the premier deal. </TEXT>

<TITLE> So you wanna make the NFL Pro Bowl interesting?  My very humble proposal.  Lunar Bowl, 2020. [x-post, r/nfl] </TITLE>

<TEXT> Okay okay, hear me out.

The NFL as an organization makes roughly $6 billion per year.  Put half that aside for the next eight years, and that means $24 billion able to be spent on a Lunar Pro Bowl by 2020.  

Virgin Galactic currently offers ticket prices of $200k for a trip into the upper atmosphere.  

Now, let's say there's a push, and Virgin Galactic decides to make a shuttle that can reach the moon and return.  Let's say it even quintuples the price of the ticket for an even $1 million.  That's enough for 24,000 people to visit the moon, definitely enough money to visit the moon.  Even with prices increased to $5million per ticket, that could get around 4,000 people to the Moon, more than enough for the teams and all the production staff.  

Advertising?  What better venue?  111 million people watched the last Super Bowl.  The first game held in space?!  You must be looking at close to 3 billion viewers, at least.

<TEXT> So only 5 people submitted on time, with a sixth the day after.

What are your thoughts on giving another week or two?  We can say only the original 5 can be voted on, or we can say it's all good, or whatever.

Personally, I'd like to see more tracks up.

I had an out of town trip, plus a battle with the flu, and I know that's whiney crybaby excuse making, but it's also just hard sometimes to find the inspiration.  When I posted the initial thread, I said 1 month to make songs, but people seemed to want only 2 weeks, which I thought would be pushing it.

Anyway, thoughts?  Should we give it one more week?  Due at the end of this coming weekend, so by Monday the 29th?   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There was Weeden last week (or two weeks ago?), and the punter this week.  

With Weeden, a lineman batted his first attempt in the air, he caught the ball, and threw it a second time.  Illegal play.  

The punter had his punt blocked, he picked the ball up, and tried to pass.  Illegal.

I don't understand why.  To me, these kinds of plays demonstrate almost everything the NFL is supposed to be about.  Well, Weeden's more so, the punter to a lesser degree.  

It showed great awareness, athleticism, composure, resiliency, and a determination to make a play.  So why is it illegal?  

And I understand that if a QB throws to a WR, the WR can't then make a second forward pass.  It just seems like in the case of blocked passes, a second attempt should be fair play. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This thread is to provide information on what the mixoff is, how it works, and how you can join.  

The simple explanation - everyone who wants to participate contributes three samples.  Out of the collected sample pool, users create songs.  At the end we vote on favorite songs.

Detailed explanation - 

**To participate you must first upload three samples.**

1) These must be instruments, synths, breaks, or beatboxing.  Or basically, anything except pure vocal samples.  *It is recommended, but not necessary* that everyone submits two instrument samples and one drum sample.

2) Samples can be a solo instrument, a combo of instruments, or whatever except for voice.  You can upload a precut loop, or upload a raw sample.

3) Samples can be any length, but try to keep them under one minute long.  

4) **Most importantly** - Also upload a txt file explaning where your samples came from.  This isn't necessary, but highly encouraged.  If you can't remember where the break is from, ah well.

5) **Also important** - name your samples as "YourUserName - sample name" for easy recognition of who has uploaded what.  WAV or lossless format is preferred, but again not necessary.

6) **You upload/download samples from here** - FTP info - host address dny.webformix.com.  Login information can be found [here](http://dny.webformix.com/)  If you have problem logging in, send me a message.  Find the "hiphopheads MIXOFF" folder in the main entry.  If you need an FTP program, I recommend CuteFTP for Windows, which you can download  [here](http://download.cnet.com/3055-2160_4-10000625.html? tag=pdl-redir_)

**Everyone then makes a song out of the collected sample pool.**

**DUE DATE FOR SAMPLES BEING UPLOADED IS THE END OF THURSDAY OCTOBER FOURTH.**  If your samples are uploaded on Friday the fifth (Pacific), you won't be considered for voting.

_______________________


**Make your song.** 

Your song can only use music/break samples from the collective sample pool.  

**Exception** You can use any voice samples you want; singing, acapella raps, your own rapping, scratching.

___________________

**Upload your final track**  

**Due Date: The end of Saturday, October 20**

You have a little over two weeks to make a track.

1) There is a folder already created for placing your tracks.  You can upload your track any time before the due date.

2) Please name your file, "YourUserName - Song Name"

3) **Also**, include a txt file explaining which samples you used, including whatever voice samples  Also nice to include is what software/hardware you used.  

________

**Voting** 

Due date is October 27, one week after tracks are due.  Create a text file, and name your first, second, and third favorite tracks. First favorites get 5 points in voting, second gets 3, third gets 1.  Add the points up, that's the winner.  

_____________

If this is your first time making music, I recommend Sound Forge and Fruity Loops, which may or may not be able to be found on torrenting sites.  Sound Forge is good for cutting samples to make loops/etc, Fruity Loops is a fairly easy to use sequencer.   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-09-30 04:07:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On a mailing list long long ago, we came up with an idea that was a blast.  You're probably familiar with Diplo?  The first song he ever made came out of this idea.  It's called a mixoff, and here are the rules we ran by - 

1) Everyone who wants to participate submits three samples.  No voice samples, only music or breaks.  We set a date on when samples must be contributed by in order to be a valid "contestant". 

2) Everyone makes a song out of the collected sample pool, and using **only** those samples.  

3) The one exception is you can use any voice samples that are not in the pool.  This includes scratching.

4) A given date, something like 2-4 weeks after the samples are submitted, is the day everyone has to have their final song submitted by.  Edit: When you submit your track you must also include a txt file saying which samples you used, and any other relevant notes.

5) We then have a vote on each song, and determine the "winner" of the mixoff.

So...what are your thoughts?  You guys down to do something like this?  

**Update** - working on securing some FTP space that I can make public for this.  An "official" post will soon follow here, and probably on /r/makinghiphop as well.  Glad to see the reaction!

<TITLE> Something about me makes people just not pay attention/care about me. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-29 05:42:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't know what it is, but there's some aspect to my personality, or something, that makes even my closest friends "forget" about me.  They throw a party, and I'm the last one invited, and only then because I just happened to call to see what's going on.  I'm attractive, I don't smell, I'm fairly articulate and intelligent and funny; it's not like I'm a 300 pound pimple faced basement dweller.  

And they're always quick to hate on me.  The instance that just occurred which caused this post - I made this mix many years ago.  I love it.  I have a friend who loves mixing music himself.  Twice I've given him copies, and he sends me messages basically saying it's crap.  Tonight we're hanging out, and I put this mix on.  He says "Wow, whatever this is, it's awesome."  Basically, he just confirmed that he didn't actually listen to my mix previously, but wasted no time laying into me about how bad it was, even though he (now obviously) hadn't actually listened to it. 

Shit like this happens all the time with me.  I don't know why.  When I do anything, I invite my friends.  When my friends do something, they don't invite me.  They criticize everything I do to the nth degree, even if they don't actually pay the slightest attention to it.  

Part of me tries to use this to better myself.  I try to tell myself, "They hate on you so much because they expect better from you."  But it's hard to do better when it seems like no matter what, they just don't give the slightest shit about me.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I use a combination of Google Chrome, with the extensions AdBlock and FlashBlock, combined with a custom hosts file (works with any browser, not just Chrome).  

AdBlock - Most of y'all are probably familiar with this already, so I won't explain further.

FlashBlock - any flash element on a website, you have to click that element before it will load/play.  So any Flash-based ads just plain won't run.  And the feeds themselves don't use flash, so you don't have to worry about the feeds not working.

Hosts file - this is the most important part.  I've had a few beers but I'll do my best to explain how to create and install the file, and after I'll explain how it works.  (TL;DR - magic.)  This is going to be a lot of text, but it's a lot easier/faster than it looks.

**Note - These are Windows Vista/Windows 7 installation instructions.  If you're using a different Windows system, the instructions will be similar but slightly different.**

First you want to visit [this site](http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/).  This is a bigass webpage with tons of weird websites, all prefixed by 127.0.0.1.  (Near the top of the page explains the different locations for different Windows versions.)

**User Tunococh pointed out - Instead of these next few steps, you can just download the hosts file directly by clicking the "text file" link on the right side of the webpage.  Then all you have to do is put it in the right spot.**, then you can skip a few steps below to "Copy that file.  In windows Explorer go to C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\"

Copy all the text on that page, every single bit.  Open Windows Notepad.  **NOT** wordpad.  **NOT** Microsoft word.  Not OpenOffice or anything else.  Notepad.  Start/Programs/Accessories/Notepad.

Paste all that text in there.  File-Save As- hosts  
Save it to your desktop to easily find it.  Go look at your desktop now.  Does the file say "hosts" or does it say "hosts.txt"?  If it says hosts.txt you can skip this next step.  If not, follow this next step.

Open Windows Explorer (hold the Windows key on your keyboard and hit E).  Hit ALT on your keyboard - this will bring up a few menus at the top - File / Edit / View / Tools / Help.  Click Tools, and in the menu that drops down, hit Folder Options.  Click the View tab in the new window that opens. You'll see an option called "Hide extensions for known file types".  Uncheck this box.  Apply or OK it.  

Now look at that hosts file on your desktop again.  You should see hosts.txt.  Right click the file, and rename it.  Delete the .txt part.  You'll get a warning from windows saying blah blah blah are you sure?  Yes, you're sure.  Now, the file should just be "hosts" and nothing else.  

Copy that file.  In Windows Explorer, go to C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\

In that folder you'll notice there's already a "hosts" file.  Rename that to "hosts.bak" - this is creating a backup version of your original file.  After you've done that, paste the "hosts" file from your desktop.

Now you're done, for realz.

The explanation for what the hosts file is, how it works, why it's neat, etc. - 

When you visit a website, you're not actually visiting reddit.com, you're visitng their server, 68.254.153.18 for instance.  So the popup ads, they come from (for a made up example) StupidAdWebsite.com at 208.5.132.7.  

What the hosts file does, it is tells your computer that StupidAdWebsite.com is *actually* located at 127.0.0.1, which is a null/void IP.  It's kinda tricking your computer into going somewhere else, but in a good way.  

This is also useful on many other websites that may be suspicious.  The hosts file contains a number of other known malware/virus websites that will try to hijack your computer, and it blocks those.  Best of all, it does so without using any extra resources from your computer, like AdBlock or whatever do.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> On PED's - or, why I think they should be allowed (to some degree).   </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-17 07:08:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll begin with some of (what I believe) are the weaker arguments, and proceed to the stronger.  

It seems the reason for the ban of PED's is that they give an "unfair" advantage to a player/team that others might not have.  Secondarily, that the use of PED's harms the "purity" of the sport and, I suppose, gives the impression to younger-folk that if they aren't good enough they can "cheat" to win.  

First, let's consider Performance Enhancing Technology.  A recent article posted here talks about Detroit's use of iPads for playbooks, and the many advantages because of this.  I won't bother Patriots' fans with more than a mention of Spygate, but even going back to 2005, when Brian Billick was in charge of the Ravens, [Wired Magazine ran an article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.09/posts.html?pg=5) about their vast archive of digital video footage, which they used to analyze the likeliness of play-calling by opponents.  Was this an "unfair" advantage?  (Their record says no, and any team could have done this; but many losing teams have players using PED's, and if they were legal, any player could use them just as any team could have had a video archive.)

Second, many types of drugs are allowed already.  From simple pain-killers like Tylenol after a game, to receiving direct injections in the middle of a game.  The player is going from playing poorly/injured, to playing somewhat-better/more normal.  This is an allowed use of PED's.  So why is the line drawn at R, rather than S or T or U or V?  Or even A or B, for that matter?

Finally, there are Performance Enhancing Surgeries.  The most recent and notable of which is Peyton Manning.  Undergoing a series of operations, he's (mostly?) recovered from a condition that as little as ten years ago would have meant instant retirement.  Knees are "reconstructed" on a routine basis, and many surgeries that would have previously meant losing a season or two are down to missing just the off-season (Adrian Peterson).  Granted, these surgeries aren't shortening tendons to make people jump higher or throw further, but that they're Performance Enhancing there can be little argument.  

One might argue that the allowance of PED's sends a signal to younger children that it's okay to use potentially harmful drugs in order to increase their chances of success.  But even just the act of playing football exposes youth to the chance of harm (concussions or worse) for the chance at bettering their life.  

Is it really so different telling someone "it's okay to cause permanent brain damage by playing your hardest" from "it's okay to cause permanent kidney/liver damage by using a drug to help you play your hardest"?  If they understand the risks and are willing to accept them, in either form, should we really be allowed to say "sure" to one and "no way" to another?  

Edit: **TL;DR** - Performance enhancing Tech, Surgeries, and some Drugs are allowed. Why not testosterone or HGH? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, I'm a pretty casual player.  In the last world I built, the compass pointed in the direction of the last bed I slept in.

I had an awesome town built in this new world.  Went exploring to replenish my stock, found a huge cavern, spent a ton of time down there.  Had to go to work.

I loaded the game, found my way out of the cavern.  Got lost.  Built a compass, followed the direction, and it led me to a random point in the jungle, apparently(?) vertically above the point I loaded my saved game from?  

Why is it not pointing to the last bed?  I slept in several beds in the town I built, I figured it would point to at least one of them.  

For a casual player, this is very frustrating. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Beating a dead horse - I finally saw TDKR and Prometheus back to back in the last two nights.  Prometheus was the superior movie.  [Spoilers] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-09 08:44:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1) Prometheus has far more replay value.  This is partially due to it being more "superficial" and stereotypical and etc.  Bottom line is I don't want to sit through 2 hours of TDKR bullcrap to get to 1 hour of interesting bits interspersed.  I already know I can put on Prometheus a number of times without worrying about boring b.s.  

2) People talk about "plot holes" in Prometheus.  Sorry, but to me, TDKR contains two GIGANTIC "plot holes" that utterly ruin the movie.  First, Batman is **THE DARK KNIGHT**, and his big fight takes place during the day?  This is just so horribly breaking with Batman's ethos.  Second, as noted in a meme the other day, "Hates guns/puts guns on every mode of transport he uses."  These are just slaps in the face to the Batman background.  

3) So a highly trained martial artist can't make an eight foot jump, but an eight year old girl can?  BULL.  SHIT.  Apparently Bruce Wayne was able to finally make the leap from the HUGE amount of suspension of disbelief from the audience.  At least the "plot holes" in Prometheus required far less suspension.  "A geologist gets lost in a cave?"  He was panicked.  People act stupid when panicked.  That's far easier to swallow than an eight year old girl out-leaping Batman.  

4) I hated Spiderman 3 because it seemed like every fucking person cried.  First Peter cries, then Mary Jane cries, then May cries, then Peter cries again, then the Sandman cries, then Peter cries again...jesus christ, I'm here to watch a superhero movie, not a chick-flick.  TDKR was much the same.

5) People can argue Prometheus was more "mindless".  I'd say TDKR was the same, it just did a better job of pretending to be deep.  Prometheus was at least honest.  "We're here to make a visual spectacle, sci-fi action flick.  Done."  TDKR was some bullshit "let's explore human nature blah blah" that came off as pretentious as a college freshman after their first Philosophy class. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, an email list.  Well technically two.  Influx, then Hindsight.  First Influx, which was a DJ Shadow fanlist.  To start.  It was a tight group, but eventually was so flooded with "noobs" that we formed Hindsight; an invite-only "elite" group of around 60 members.  The most popular of us was the musician Diplo (his stories from his travels in India are hard to forget).  

It started as a DJ Shadow fanlist, but we became a lot more than that.  I learned how to shave properly from them, among the other LPT's and whatnot that sprang up.  We had mixoffs, which lead to my short but wonderful musical "career".  

I did a road trip around the US in 1999, mostly crashing at houses of people I met off this list.  And I moved to Australia a few months later because I was debating what to do with my life, and one person said semi-jokingly, "Hey, move to Australia."  So I got a student visa and I did.  Best time of my life.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Me 31, her 27.  Dated 4.5 years or so, engaged for the final 8 months, broken up for a year and a month now.  

We kept in contact the first 6 months or so.  Somewhat.  Sometimes lovey emails, sometimes hate emails, sometimes sad emails.  I finally said "no more" and broke off all contact.  But shortly after the one year "anniversary" of our split, she emailed me, and we talked a bit.  

And while exchanging emails, I thought I was finally over it.  I felt good.  I met a new lady shortly after.  I thought, "Yes, finally, I've moved on."

Today I woke up at 4 AM, after a dream in which she was the main star.  And it was the least-abstract dream I've had in some time.  No abrupt transitions, no weird gorillas that could talk, nothing like that.  My dream was basically "a day in the life of", where I was trying to convince her we should get back together, and she said no; which is, basically, what happened those many months ago.  

And now I feel like I'm back at the same spot I was a year ago.  Even the cheesiest love song that played on the radio at work made me think of her.  Nearly broke down a few times.

<TITLE> Dear r/NFL'ers - this started as a joke on nflcirclejerk, but I'm actually curious - why do so many of you contribute to a good discussion, but refuse to vote on the thread? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-28 07:02:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's a bit of a trend that's been on the upswing over the months.  I kinda figured in the offseason the opposite would happen, but no.

Also, please note, I'm not speaking in 100% absolutes.  There are exceptions to the above statement, I agree.  **Generally,** this has been my observation.  Similarly, I understand discussions don't always need to be from self. posts but can take place in imgur.com links about Rex Ryan's weight loss.  Finally, I also understand that 500 comments does not = 500 unique commenters, and many people add many comments to a single thread.

When people talk about why r/NFL is great, it's generally agreed the discussions are why.  But you guys are damn freaking stingy with upvoting the threads that inspire the discussions.  

A few examples - 

[What's your "Holy shit, they do know what they're doing" moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/x9kxa/whats_your_holy_shit_they_do_know_what_theyre/) - 106 comments, 16 total votes, 13 upvotes.  0.15 votes per coment.

[Will Tom Brady's two Super Bowl loses affect his place in history?](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/x7zso/will_tom_bradys_two_super_bowl_loses_affect_his/) 160 comments, 49 total votes, 36 upvotes.  0.3 votes per comment.

[What is the biggest "If" for your team this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/x769t/what_is_the_biggest_if_for_your_team_this_year/) 397 comments(!), 62 total votes(?!?!), 56 upvotes.  0.15 votes per comment.  

/r/NFL - Y U SO STINGY about something you like so much, namely, discussions?  They're buried under twitters and imgur links because they don't get any upvote love. 

If you really love discussions, help get them to the front page of /r/nfl, eh?

Edit: Now you've just upvoting this thread and not commenting to fuck with me.  Damn you ironic bastards!

Edit 2: Also I throw off my own statistics since I comment on my own posts a lot.  Cause I'm vain like that. </TEXT>

A friend had an X-Box with XBMC, but IIRC that also had a limit to playlist size.

All I'm looking for is to basically create my own "TV channel", where everything I have plays randomly non-stop.  Turn on the screen and something's on, without having to switch between a number of playlists or things like that.  

Does such a thing exist?

Edit Update: So I've got a few great answers regarding PC software, and I'll end up using one or the other.  

Is there a stand-alone device (like an X-Box running XBMC) that can do something like this, that doesn't require a PC?  Like that Boxxee thing or whatever? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night I saw two/three movies.  I caught the screenings of the two episodes from The Next Generation that were being shown in theaters, and the friends I went with hadn't seen the Avengers yet and wanted to, so fuck it, I went to that too.  

There wasn't a single cell phone that went off during any of the three screenings.  

However, twice per screening (a total of six times), about 10 minutes into the start and 10 minutes before the end of each, some staff member came in with a clipboard, stood at one end of the aisle and used a small flashlight to look at his board.  He then preceded to walk along the front of the theater, in front of the whole length of the screen, to check to make sure the exit door was properly closed, I guess to make sure people couldn't sneak in.  

Thinking back on past movie-going experiences, I don't think this is a rare occurrence at all.  And it's really fucking annoying.  

If the manager who posted about etiquette the other day reads this - please don't have your staff do this.  Is the threat of someone sneaking in really so great that you'll purposely interrupt my immersion?  I thought you didn't really make much money from the tickets anyway, most of your money came from concessions.

<TEXT> For me, it was being within a few inches of an Australian [funnel web spider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_funnel-web_spider)

I'm an American who lived in Australia from 2000 to 2003.  At one point I was living in a house that had only one toilet, which was basically a glorified outhouse.  A separate room, completely detached from the house itself.  The "window" was just a rectangular hole cut out of the wall.  

So I wander outside a bit drunk, and I unzip and start going pee, and that's when I see it.  About arms-length away, at the edge of the window.  The second I see it, it starts raising its front legs much like the picture in that link.  

All I can think is "oh please god don't be able to jump, please just don't be able to jump" as I manage to squeeze off my stream.  

There was an empty beer bottle left in the bathroom.  I *very very* slowly reach down for said bottle, grab it, and with every inch of courage I can muster, reach over and smash the living fuck out of the spider.  I just smash and smash and smash until the fear of breaking the bottle out-weighs the fear of the spider, which was huge.  

So how close have you come to facing your mortality in the form of another living creature? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The [kinda lengthy, *very* Socially Awkward Penguin story of the girl I posted here](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/wmo6j/you_want_a_sap_i_can_give_you_a_sap/), but there's a good bit of the story I left out.

In June of last year I was laid off.  A few weeks later, my fiance and I split up.  We'd been together almost 5 years.  The thing is, I initiated the split; she really wanted children, I really didn't.  I'd been able to trick myself into thinking I wanted kids, but my last job was working with kids which brought the issue to a head.  

And the thing is, I didn't really stop loving her after the breakup.  It was really only in the last week that I'd finally started to feel some sort of closure.  I don't know how or why, but something started to click, and I felt I was finally ready to move on.  

On to the job - I'd only seriously applied for one other job in the past year.  About 5 months ago Verizon was hiring.  I applied; got a phone call the next day, "We need to fill this slot very quickly, can you come in right away?"  I interviewed two days later ("right away" in corporate time).  The manager **loved** me.  

I didn't get the job.  I was kinda crushed.  I'd had a lot of these sorts of cock-tease job offers in the past and this one coming in a time I was already emotionally weakened...well I basically gave up.

This was the first resume I'd turned in since then.  And really, this was my first attempt at talking to a girl since around then, also.  

I'm trying not to get too excited for either; maybe I'll break the espresso machine or maybe she just gave me her number to be nice.  

But I'm at least realizing that if I try, I can do it.   </TEXT>

Lo and behold, a friend's sister and her friend (call her Casandra, the one I like) are joining my friends for an activity.  There's a bit of chatting getting to know one another, all innocent.  

Later in the night, I'm hoping there's some chance to get Casandra alone to ask for her number.  Success!  One friend stays out to finish his cigarette, her friend and my other friend both go to use bathrooms; just me and her.  She'd mentioned a place that makes beer ice-cream earlier in the night, I asked if she'd like to go sometime soon.  She says yes!  I get her number, we go back to chatting a bit, friends trickle in.

About 5 minutes later...

Casandra had mentioned a few times before how she was "probably ready to go home soon, order some food," but she was reliant on her friend for a ride.  

Without asking Casandra, I instead just turn to her friend and pretty much randomly say, "So I could give Casandra a ride home, if you still wanted to hang out."

What.  The.  Fuck.  DidIJustSayomyfuckinggodI'msofuckingstupidjesuschrist you didn't even ask her first?!

Her friend replies, "Oh no it's okay, my brother won't miss me anyway," and she turns around and tickles him and teases him and they're arguing and distracted.

I turn to Casandra.  "I'm sorry, I just meant it sounded like you wanted to get home and order some dinner is all."

Her reply: "Oh it's okay.  You could come in and have some dinner with me."

HOLY SHIT.  MIND SO FUCKING BLWON.

Her friend then intrudes, "So really I'm okay leaving anyway, I'll give her a ride home."  

Still, I got her number, and the most epic response to me totally stuffing my foot so far into my mouth.  

A few days, then I'll call, right? </TEXT>

<TITLE> My opinion on one of the bigger problems with America. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-15 08:30:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Something I've felt for some time now, is one of the biggest issues America faces is that the vast majority of Americans have become entirely too infatuated with the phrase, "Suckerrrrrrrrr."  

We've become a nation largely composed of scammers, slackers, spammers, and generally lazy people.  We love the idea of being able to pull a fast one over someone else.  

Yes, there are still a great many people out there who value hard work and honesty.  But year by year, that percentage drops.  

We really just want to do the least work for the most reward possible, from the minimum wagers to the One Percenters.  We love getting away with reading reddit while at work, saving a few hundred dollars on piping when constructing a $200k house by building shower heads 5 1/2 feet tall, bidding for a government contract to repave a road and figuring out how to do it as cheaply as possible to pocket as much as possible, creating a dating website and populating it with employee-created accounts to keep users from unsubscribing.  

There's no longer such a thing as doing a good job, just doing the best job for the least effort.

<TITLE> As a subscriber to r/Soccer and r/NFL, I'm here to say - I apologize for the animosity many fans of the NFL have for soccer. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-13 00:13:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At /r/NFL a bit of a problem has arisen.  Someone has been trolling almost every submission and downvoting every single comment.  Every. single. one.  

After a day of posting comments at /r/NFL pretty frequently for 24 hours, plus a bit of insomnia that kept me up til 5 AM (PST), I noticed most of the auto-downvoting occurs at a time roughly analogous with Europe.  (Or it's an American with really bad sleeping habits.)  Which is to say, most of the troll downvotes occur roughly starting at 10-11 AM, Western/Central European time, and end around 5-6 PM.  

I pointed this out, and someone made a joke about "we should storm the gates of r/soccer and /r/rugby just in case."  

That's when I thought the troll might be a soccer fan.  

But it's very easy to see why a soccer fan might end up doing such a thing.  Here, and at r/sports, fans of the NFL are typically very rude, asshole-ish, and downright hateful about soccer.  

Regardless of whether or not it's someone from r/Soccer, I would still like to apologize for the comments and attitudes from fans of the NFL.  Football and football are my two favorite sports, and I hate seeing fans from one side attack fans of the other.  And, for the most part, it's NFL fans attacking soccer fans.  

Here's to hoping for football peace.

Edit: for some clarity, this isn't a personal troll just downvoting me.  It's someone downvoting practically *every* comment in *every* thread, regardless of which fan makes the comment.  The mods have noticed it happening for awhile now.  And yes I have too much time on my hands, so I reviewed my recent comments and saw they were right.  

Also, I'm not saying this just to (hopefully) get the troll to back off.  On the rare occasions an r/sports thread shows up on my front page, and soccer is mentioned, NFL fans tend to become irrationally hateful.  That's what I'm mainly apologizing for.  Y'all are lovely, despite the many downvotes this thread has. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From /r/ShittySeduction here.

I started the sub mostly as a joke.  Someone in ShittyAskReddit asked if there was a ShittySeduction, and there wasn't, so I made it.  And for the longest time I didn't really know what a "good" ShittySeduction post should look like.  

It took a few months, but I started to see them.  

[I just met you, and this is crazy, but I have a gun. Get in the van.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittySeduction/comments/tpclh/i_just_met_you_and_this_is_crazy_but_i_have_a_gun/)

[I've heard about 'karma whores' on Reddit. How much karma do I need to buy one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittySeduction/comments/u08x2/ive_heard_about_karma_whores_on_reddit_how_much/)

A few others.  I messaged the submitters personally, thanking them for finally showing me what a good ShittySeduction post should look like, and telling them I wish I had some sort of custom flair or other "prize" or something to give them.  

So I thought of this idea, as a way to hopefully get those posts to the front page.  Not just because it would help my shitty sub, but as a reward for a good post.  I feel if they posted in plain old ShittyAskReddit or something, they probably would have made it to the front page.  Instead they posted it in mine, where they had almost zero chance of that. 

Thoughts?  (Also I do see there's /r/shittypostoftheday but once a day seems too often to gain any traction, and a shitty post that makes the front page will obviously win that award, so it's not exactly helping to "spread the wealth," so to speak.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm exploring teaching English in Korea, so I did a search on reddit and opened up all the AMA's I found.  Almost every single one uses a phrase like this : 

"As for the HOW: It's very simple. Find a recruiter. "

And they don't mention which recruiter/agency they use.  

In the comments some people throw out certain names, but I can't figure out if - 

1) those comments are upvoted just for providing ANY name, or,  
2) an unscrupulous recruiter is using multiple reddit accounts to upvote themselves.

When people have dealt with bad agents they tend to post those names.  But it's much more rare that someone with a good experience mentions which agency/recruiter they used.  

I'm already a bit fearful about moving to Korea, I don't want to end up using a bad agent and getting screwed.   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-07-10 08:56:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Only started playing 2-3 weeks ago, and I've only done survival mode with randomly generated maps.  After successfully building my first redstone circuits (very very crude ones at that) I began to fantasize about pistons.  

I had this idea for building a car, primarily using pistons/sticky pistons as the "Wheels"...if you've read Snowcrash by Neal Stephenson, something along the lines of the spoked wheels on the skateboards.  

So for the first time I decided to launch a creative mode world and see if I could build it.  

I get why...should a single piston move an entire city placed on top of it upwards a block?  That would be silly.  Or should it just move a small range of blocks?  That'd be tricky to figure out.  

Ah well, back to survival mode! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice on dealing with "raw" wood?  (I have a giant cross-section of a tree I'm wondering what to do with.) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-09 06:30:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For background info, I'm not an entire noob when it comes to woodworking, my degree is in furniture design after all.  However, that was dealing with processed wood - planks and whatnot.  

The other day I found a neighbor had cut down one of their trees and had a whole ton of logs there for the taking, so I grabbed two.  [Here's a picture of one, with my slipper on it for better sense of scale](http://imgur.com/siXBD)

My plan was to use an angle grinder and create...something.  This something is somewhat in the air because I'm not as certain of "Raw" wood properties as I am of "processed" wood properties, such as expansion/contraction, how the wood will age over the years, etc.

One idea I had with this piece in particular was to grind away about 40-60% of the material, attach a few metal posts going upright to support a glass surface.  Kinda an inversion of the typical "wood=tabletop" mentality, and use it as a semi-natural base.  Another idea for a second log (which is about 10" diameter, 10" height) was to drill out some "holes" and use it as a log flower pot.  

So the things I'm wondering about - 

Regarding the table, if I just, say, use some screws to connect the metal supports for the glass surface, is this wood so much more likely to deform (since it still has a higher moisture content) that it will eventually pop out the screws?  

Am I able to just grind/sand to a nice surface and apply a good varnish, and it will mostly look the same from then on?  Or will there be a significant water/color loss over time, since it's higher moisture content than properly treated wood?  

For the log flower pot idea, similarly, can I apply a thick enough varnish/lacquer/whatever on the surfaces that house the plant (drilling holes to provide drainage), that the water from watering the plants won't harm the wood?  Or after some amount of time, will watering the plants cause the wood to rot from being too moist? </TEXT>

In poker it's called the "slow play", where you keep making the minimum bet in order to "stay in the game" when you actually have a great hand.  That's what Picard does, that the other captains would only pull off occasionally.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Suggestion] New material - Silver.  Suggested uses included. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-04 06:25:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Base info: Roughly as rare as gold, more common in caves under tundra regions.  

Creates (alone) :

Silver ingot.

Silver Sheet - 3 silver ingots in a row.  Solid light-grey with glass-like highlights, 1/4-height block, can be placed on any surface (ground, wall, ceiling). On ceiling - if block above is removed, silver drops as well.  Persists on walls/ground.

Silver Coins - Does not require multiple-slots for creation, however, only able to be created through multiples of 4 ingots.  4 ingots = 1 coin.  i.e. The only possible creations are 4 ingots for 1 coin, 8/2, 12/3, 16/4, 20/5, etc... (i.e. pressing 'e' all of your ingots will be in one slot, for creation on the fly, but requires the specific numbers still.)

Created (combined with other materials) : 

Mirror - 3 wood planks left column, 3 wood planks right column,  2 glass panes middle column (top and bottom slots), 1 silver sheet center = 1x1 mirror.  Can be combined to create larger mirrors like chests/art.  Only reflects a five-block distance.

Quicksilver - Single column, coal on top, water in a bucket in the middle (bucket persists, water removed), silver ingot on the bottom.  Quicksilver combines with iron to create steel.  (Say, 3 quicksilvers to 1 iron = 1 steel.)  ((Steel, for now, only to be used for armor/tools.  Steel helmet, steel axe, steel sword...))

Silver-tipped Arrows - 4 arrows + 1 silver ingot = 2 silver-tipped arrows.  50% chance to one-hit kill undead mobs.

<TITLE> Back again with more probably noob questions/observations about NPC villages/villagers. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-04 05:32:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Heyo!  So.  Found a village.  Started rocking it. More questions have arisen.

1) Can you create a specific type of villager (eventually) by creating their specific buildings?  My village didn't have a blacksmith, so I build a forge following the blueprints from the minecraft wiki, hoping that would create one.  Technically, I'm 3 stone bricks short from completing the roof, but everything else is there.  Will a blacksmith eventually spawn from breeding and take up occupation there?  

2) Does there need to be an equivalent of a "local economy" in order to encourage a population increase?  i.e. Aside from just doors, do I need to build more wheat farms/churches/forges?  

2b) Similarly, does the environment need to be population-friendly to encourage population growth?  The village I found was smack dab in the middle of the desert.  I've imported a ton of grass/dirt and trees, and I notice during the day that a large proportion of villagers enjoy spending time in the grass.  It makes me wonder if I should attempt grassing-over my entire village.

3) Is there ever a way to make a village completely safe from hostile mobs?  I've got a giant wall surrounding everything, but does the village need to be 100% enclosed (as in create a roof over everything) to keep hostile mobs out?  Or will littering the ground with torches eventually keep them away?

4) Can someone tell me what's wrong with my [apartment building](http://imgur.com/DO4QR)?  It doesn't seem to be spawning anything, and no one stays there at night.  Is it because I got greedy and built all three levels at once?  Should I have built one level, waited for all the rooms to be taken up, then the second level, then the third?  It's only just across "the street" from a regularly inhabited, naturally created building.  Would replacing the wool carpets with glass blocks cause them to be inhabitable?  (The reason for confusion is I occasionally, but very rarely, see an NPC spend the night in one of the rooms, but it's typically one maximum.)

5) Oh man I love this game.  Two weeks in, five different maps, a dozen (or two) deaths that make me rip my hair out.  And I haven't even gotten into redstone circuitry yet. 

Some other random observations - sandstone works as a building material, even though the discussion on the minecraft wiki says it doesn't.  My sandstone buildings are thriving, while my cobblestone apartments are failing.  

Iron Golems are idiots.  3 out of my 5 routinely get stuck in a 1-block deep pond and just sit there confused until I push them out using stairs.  A day or two later and they end up right back in the same spot.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> I can't find the answer I'm looking for in google/forums, so I bring my (probably really noob) questions to you - NPC VILLAGES?!?!?! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-29 00:36:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I pretty much just clicked "Create a new world" and started doing stuff.  I reached a point where I could start making serious maps, so I decided to go out in search of an NPC village.  After searching 6 maps worth of area I've yet to find one.  So my questions -

1) Do they *only* spawn in flat-land worlds?  Comments in forums made me believe they're more common in flat-lands, but they should still exist in other types.  (My world is a big mix of everything, some flat, some desert, some plains, some giant hills...)

2) Do they appear on a map before you find them?  I've basically been cruising coastlines, figuring at some point I'll see some weird geometric pattern that suggest humans.  Now I'm wondering if I have to actually find the village up close before it will appear on a map.  

3) Are borders of plains/deserts the best place to find them?  On my 6 maps, I've found literally zero places where big deserts border big plains.  Either desert islands or deserts next to swamps or plains surrounded by jungle/tundra.  

4) Do they only appear in multiplayer games?  This game is single player.

I'd prefer not starting a new map just to get villages, but I also don't want to feel like I'm "missing out" by not having villages on this map.  (Also I don't want to do mods/hacks or things of that nature.)

Thanks!

Edit: PS - I'm quite certain I had "generate buildings" turned on when the map was created.  I found an abandoned mine, so that means there should be villages too, yes? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-06-14 02:02:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This started as a comment in another thread that I thought I should expand upon here.

Futurology could use something like a Marketing/PR Department.  

Off the top of my head - convincing Intel/IBM to set up manufacturing facilities on the moon.  

CPU's require silica, found in abundance in lunar regolith.

The manufacturing facilities require some of the cleanest/purest air on Earth.  On the moon that's not a worry; put workers in a spacesuit and they can work in a sealed (and automatically sterilized) vacuum. 

They also require intense heating, 1500-2000 degrees Celsius.  A solar reflector removes the majority of energy costs needed for that.   

And they already spend billions to set up these facilities here.  

Living in Oregon, I see plenty of towns that were created for a specific industry (logging).  Some industries may be able to be convinced to do the same with the Moon. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I believe I know what the "problem" with Futurology/the Singularity is, in terms of general acceptance of the notion. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-11 07:01:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The claims that often spring from such notions are that we (the majority of carbon-based sentient bipedal life) will some day, whether in 20 years or 80 or 200, achieve "immortality", most often through downloadable replications of our personality.

The problem that I see with this is a notion that I've seen repeated several times in several places, so I will just do a rough paraphrasing of the general sentiment -

"When you tell someone they're a million times more likely to get cancer from standing near paint fumes, the number is so large they find it laughable.  Tell someone they're 10 times more likely to get cancer from standing near paint fumes and they believe you."

This seems to me the fundamental "flaw" in Futurology - it will be hard to gain true acceptance as an idea because it promises **too** much.  

This thought sprang from thinking how many posts here I should try to post in the general reddit subs, and how none of them would be believed/upvoted.  

If we told people about just the first 10 years of Russia2045 (or whatever), they might understand/accept enough to begin seriously considering it, even if sporadically.  When we tell people the *entire* Russia2045 concept, it becomes an idea they find laughable.

<TITLE> Ladies, how frequently do you enjoy sex? (Not necessarily orgasm.) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-11 06:39:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few notes/further questions/etc. -

First, I don't mean how often do you orgasm.  This seems to vary wildly.  But even if you don't orgasm, are you still enjoying the act?

Second, was there a time you went from not enjoying to enjoying?  Was it a specific person, but other people after continued the enjoyment?  Was the enjoyment confined to the lone person?  

Third, this all sprang from a lady friend who had been in one very long relationship, and only two people in her life.  When she said she never enjoyed it, I immediately thought "I have to show her what she's missing."  It was after that, I realized how often I'd had that thought because of how often I'd heard the previous statement.  

As a guy, I know I've had plenty of "just okay" sex and plenty of "holy lord thank you for these gifts" sex, but even the "just okay" I orgasm so it's "enjoyable."  

If you had to put percents on enjoy vs. meh, what would it be? </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoiler ALL) The deaths of characters - an honest discussion, without resorting to cliches ("he kills everyone you care about") </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-05 06:27:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'd like to have a proper discussion on this subject.  I'm curious about how my interpretations of the books may be skewed based on personal feelings, or if I'm being too cynical when one of my "favorite" characters dies.

________________________

Eddard - This part is still shocking to me, in a wonderful way.  I still find myself thinking "Goddamn" and "If only...or maybe if..."  I think his death was necessary; both for setting the tone of the books, and also because he's almost too perfect not to kill.  Ned was almost like this perfect human, he kinda plain didn't "fit" in the GoT universe.

Catelyn (kinda) - Okay, she was brought back.  Before I knew that, I was somewhat heartbroken, though not as much as Robb (who died at the same time).  I'm not sure if this is simply because I cared somewhat less for Cat.  I've stated elsewhere that I have trouble sympathizing with Cat because she often makes bad situations worse.  But while I thought "She didn't deserve that", I also thought it was also a somewhat "necessary" death, for reasons I can't explain as well as Ned's.  I *loved* that she was brought back.

Robb - For awhile I held hope he'd share a "fate" like Cat's; they sewed the wolf head to his body, maybe he'd come back as a wolfman?  Okay, that would just be silly.  This one hurt more than any other death, I think.  Not because of the character necessarily, but because of my belief in his "righteous" cause.  I still don't know if it was his death, or the death of his cause, that hurts most.  But overall a death I don't think is uncalled for or done just because I like him.

Jon (possibly?) -  This death is what made me feel most cynical about the series, and question whether I'd keep reading.  This death felt the most forced, and taking myself out of the GoT universe, it felt like it made the hundreds of pages of reading about Jon's unification attempts of Crows/Wildlings completely irrelevant.  "Surely" their alliance will break now, so why did I read ~300 pages building this alliance?  But, hey, other characters have survived worse, so maybe he'll be back?  (He has made friends with some magical people lately.)

Daenyrs (possibly?) - Sorry for the disordered list, but Jon reminded me of Daenyrs because, again taking myself out of the GoT universe, it felt very forced and made many hundreds of pages of reading seem irrelevant.  Again, she's not necessarily dead, she certainly has it easier than Jon in that Drogon might be able to scare the Dothraki and save her.  If that isn't the case, it feels like all these threads were carefully and intricately woven together into a rope that was then severed and split for lulz.  

There are other characters I could get into, but that feels like a good start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For instance, lots of people are asking about Qorin Halfhand.  Why did he and Jon fight, why did Jon kill him.  If you re-watch the episode in which they're captured, or even just the "Previously on Game of Thrones intro" for S2E10, it's kinda obvious.  

That's just the most obvious question I can think of since it's most recent.  But I know I've seen dozens of other questions that can **easily be answered by paying careful attention to previous episodes.**  

Another frequent one - Why was Mellisandre left behind when Stannis sailed on King's Landing?  Answered in an earlier episode.

Another - How did Theon capture Winterfell?  Weren't there a bunch of troops there?  Again, the reason Winterfell was undefended was clearly spoken in a previous episode.  

What's wrong with an excuse to re-watch the show?  If you have a question, before coming here, try watching the previous episode or two.  Or even just the "Previously on..." is likely to answer it.  

But I'm starting to think a lot of you people with tons of questions are distracted by reddit when watching and you're just missing key bits of dialogue.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, a bit of a big stink has been made in this sub lately, regarding the different strategy employed by Tyrion in ACoK vs. the show.  **If you're planning on reading ACoK and don't want to know, stop reading now please.**

__________________


Okay, so in the book, Tyrion uses a great big chain to catch a bunch of ships in his wildfire trap.  This idea never felt comfortable to me.  There were a bunch of ships, being pushed downstream, against the chain, while on fire...

The basic question is - how big does that chain have to be in order to not break?

In order to make your job a little easier, I've tried coming up with the numbers for you.  (We'll also ignore the wildfire for the time being).  But of course, these numbers weren't so easy to find.  SO -

1) There's no map with a scale for King's Landing, but it *seems* from descriptions to be roughly analogous to the river Thames in London.  London Bridge is **265 meters**, so we'll say that's the length of the chain from tower to tower.

2) It is crazy difficult to find a simple KPH/MPH for a river since they're all measured in gallons discharged.  One of the best answers I could find is "a brisk walking pace," so I guess around **4 MPH.**  Then again that doesn't include the mass of the water adding to the pressure exerted, so if you want discharge, **5,696 million litres/day** is average near London.  

3) It's also confusing just how many ships are caught up against the chain, but it seems to be around 8-12 main vessels, and maybe a few smaller ones.  [13th Century Cogs had three classes](http://www.abc.se/~m10354/mar/cog.htm); under 10 tons, 10-24 tons, and the lovingly vague "more than 24 tons".  I'm going to say there are 5 Cogs at 35 tons each, 3 cogs at 18 tons, and 4 more vessels at 8 tons.  175t + 54t + 32t, or **261 tons** worth of ship pressing against the chain.  

So we have a 265 meter chain, supporting 261 tons of ship, being pushed at 4 MPH by the river.

If you don't actually want to do the maths, but have a pretty good idea of an estimate - is it even remotely possible that an iron chain big enough could have been constructed that would hold up?  (Also, anchoring the chains in the towers without one end or the other ripping loose?)  Or are we talking about a chain that would have had to have been like 10 feet thick? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems to me that only a highly unified Earth would be able to put forth the necessary effort/focus required to bring about the Singularity.  Or, at least, it could help bring it about ~20-40 years sooner than it otherwise would.

<TITLE> TV spoilers galore (and Book spoilers too) - What prophecies/foreshadowing have you noticed, from early episodes to the current one, that weren't necessarily explained? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-05-24 08:36:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Note: I am **NOT** going to use spoiler tags in my post, maybe comments will.  But you were well warned in the title. **PLEASE STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS UP TO THE CURRENT EPISODE.  Book spoilers only go through the current TV episode, so through the early parts of Book Three or so.**  I will use spoiler tags for anything past the end of Book Two/the current episode, and encourage others to do the same.

**Also,** I don't mean foreshadowing that was later easily explained, like, say, [TV Spoiler S2E6?](/s "the House of Undying stealing the dragons, since that was thoroughly spelled out.")  

I finally got my parents to start watching the show (which they now love), so I've been re-watching from the start for the third or fourth time.  I'm only through the third episode with them, but already I've noticed so many.  I'm sure others of you have noticed many I've missed.  Without further adieu...

_______________________

What first started this was Catelyn telling Bran, "You always look at your feet before you lie."  So I rewatched the episode where Theon takes Winterfell.  When Theon asks Bran where Hodor is, Bran looks at his feet. He seems to be looking at his feet again when he says "I've yielded Winterfell to Theon."  

In S1EP1, Daenyrs gets into a bath.  Her servant tells her, "It's too hot!"  At the time I thought she was just desensitized from what was about to happen to her.  

When Jorah finds out Daenyrs is pregnant, he suddenly has to leave, and says he'll rejoin the Dothraki horde later.  I didn't pay much attention to this and I had no idea why, until book four or five.  This also explains [Book 4 spoiler, TV Spoiler](/b "Why Jorah suspected the wine merchant wasn't totally honest")

Tyrion says he's visiting the wall and wants to piss off the edge of the world.  He later pisses off the wall.  (Minor one, I know.)

In S1E1, [TV Spoiler, future episode, book three or four spoiler](/s "Jaime says he would rather die than live as a cripple.")

Finally, and this one is kinda weak, but in S1E1, Jaime mentions Robert "fucks boars and hunts whores," and is later completely fucked over by a boar.  

I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting, and when I finish the re-watching the rest of the first season I'll find even more.

It just amazes me how well thought out the book/show is, that they have so many little references like this, that can often seem like just witty dialogue at the time, but in fact foreshadow future events. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To be honest, the previous two or three episodes I found somewhat lacking.  They were good, still far better than typical TV sludge, but it was more-so a few awesome moments mixed into the generally-good stew.  I also understand most people think every latest episode is the best, since it's the newest.

But this last episode, just...every single goddamn nuance was amazing.  A single eyebrow-twitch was so perfectly performed, the slight smirk from Cersei, the awesome return of Varys, how they brought together the "loose ends" from the slight deviations from the books...

This show being one of my all-time favorites is not in question.  But this latest episode in particular will forever be iconic of the show, a la Seinfeld's "The Bet", the Simpsons visiting Itchy and Scratchy land, or Sealab 2021's "I, Robot".  It was just the greatest distillation of what the whole show is about.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reached nightmare mode, and all I can think is Titan's Quest, a very old game, is superior in every way except graphics.

1) If there's a difference between "pro" and "noob" players, I can't tell.  The only difference I see is who gets distracted from the main quests or not.

2) Follow-the-path leveling.  You reach level 30, you get the level 30 skill.  Simple as that.  In TQ reaching a certain level would cause me to reconsider my entire build, skills and items and all.  I'd pay assloads of gold to un-level one ability to put those points in a different ability.  

2b) Leveling cont. Dual character types in TQ.  You could be a warrior-mage, or a wizard-thief, or a spell-casting archer.  In D3 you are your one character, no more no less.  

3) Ridiculously simplistic "gameplay."  TQ made me feel strategy was involved in some way.  D3 is kite and click and nothing else.

Late edit 4) The graphics.  The "fog" in the first act just makes my eyes hurt.  

Sorry, but after 12 years and billions of dollars from WoW, I expected far more.

**What's included** 

Sheets 1-3) The Strength of Schedule analysis.  Sheet 1 the numbers in no particular order.  Sheet 2 each division in order of how frequently they play future playoff teams.  Sheet 3 each division in order of win percent against future playoff teams.

Sheet 4) Averaging each division's ranking in terms of total points per game allowed.  

Sheet 5) The division's W-L record, combined.

**Faults, explanations, "logic"**

1) I only looked at the last 5 years.  Going back 10 years would probably normalize some numbers.

2) Points per game was looked at because NFL.com doesn't have a "total defense" ranking.  Also if a team can put up 400 yards passing but only earn 10 points, I'd say that D they're against is pretty tough in terms of bend-don't-break.  YPA and YPC could probably be added.  (You're welcome to work it out and message me the results.)

3) I was about to throw in stats for W-L against common opponents, but that's probably the hardest to sort through, and certain trends were becoming pretty apparent anyway.  Seemed like a lot of work for (probably) not very compelling evidence.  

4) Again, this all ends up semi-arbitrary.  Which stats you feel are stronger/etc.  

**Conclusions, interesting numbers**

The division that has played the most games against future playoff teams : The AFC North. (41.25%)

The division that has played the least games against future playoff teams : The NFC West. (32.19%)

The division that has won the most games against future playoff teams : AFC South. (37.5%)

The division that has won the least games against future playoff teams : NFC West. (17.48%)

The division with the best average PPG over 5 years : AFC North, average ranking of 10.45.

The division with the worst average PPG over 5 years : AFC West, average ranking of 20.25.

Best combined W-L ratio over 5 years : ~~AFC South, 174-146.~~ NFC East, 174-145-1.  [A tie counts for half a win.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/slk04/an_attempt_at_quantifying_what_is_the_toughest/c4eztov) 

Worst combined W-L ratio over 5 years : NFC West, 127-193.

The **AFC South** was the only division where every team won at least one game against a future playoff team every single season.  

The **AFC North** has the second worst record against future playoff teams.  Mostly because the Browns and Bengals, out of 10 combined seasons, have 5 seasons where they did not win a single game against a future playoff team.

The **NFC East** is 1/2 a game ~~out of tied~~ ahead for first at best W-L ratio.  The Eagles tie with the ~~Browns~~ Bengals has them at 174-145-1, technically a half game better than the AFC South.

The **AFC South** has two seasons with the best W-L record.  The **NFC South** is second with one season the best, and one season tied for the best.  The **AFC North** is third with one season the best.  The **AFC East** is fourth with one season tied for the best.  However, the **AFC South** also has one season with the worst W-L record.  The **NFC West** has four seasons with the worst.

There have only been three instances of a division whose average PPG rankings are in the single digits.  The **NFC East** once (2008), and the **AFC North** twice (2011, 2008, and very close in 2010 and 2009 also).

The **AFC North** and **NFC East** are the only two divisions to win 30 or more games per season every year.  

**Conclusion(?)** 

The AFC North is arguably the toughest, however the AFC South gives them a very strong run for their money and in some ways was the tougher division.  And the NFC North, South and East are all very close as well.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems no one ever does this.  I tried it out for two games to see what it was like, and it was confusing as hell when shopping for the first game, but by the end of the second game I found it to be far more useful in the lower right.  

Since the primary actions travel from South West to North East, there's far less chance of accidentally clicking the minimap.

I also find that it makes me analyze more of the screen, leading to better map awareness.  Most of the important things are on the left -ally icons, minimap, attributes.  By switching the map to the right, instead of doing a quick scrolling glance along the left, I more routinely seem to do whole-screen glances instead.  

I haven't found a disadvantage to it being on the right, other than taking two games to get used to it.  The advantages might be small on the right, but even small advantages are useful.

<TEXT> Or similarly, when an owner dies and passes the team on to their kids as an inheritance, does the NFL have the right to tell the new owner they *have* to sell the team?  Do inheritances have to be approved the way other new owners (Khan) need league approval?

I'm thinking of the Chargers and Rams.  

The Chargers aren't being run into the ground.  But only five owners have owned an NFL team longer than Spanos, at 28 years.  For how long he has been an owner, his name never once came up in the CBA's, his name never comes up in the competition committees, he's almost never available for comment in the San Diego Union Tribune.  To me these are signs of an owner who just does not care about the game, only about the money.

And with the Rams, they seem to be squatting at the bottom of the division for better leverage when it comes to moving the team.  Like  they're purposely being bad to upset the fanbase enough that they'll want the team to leave.   </TEXT>

I went to [/r/Sweden](/r/Sweden) to get help picking a team, and that's when I was told no individual can own more than 49% of a team, and most teams are owned primarily by the communities.  

There's also pretty good parity, though a handful of teams show up in the top 8 fairly regularly.

<TEXT> Firstly because I'm trying to find a rival.

Second, the League has a rule that no individual can own more than 49% of a team, with many/most teams owned primarily by the communities they play in.  I immediately thought of Green Bay when I was told this.  

Second B, the League also seems to have a lot of parity, compared to other Leagues constantly dominated by one or two teams.  

Third, their games start around 12 noon in Wisconsin.  

Malmo FF ftw!

<TITLE> So what could the NFL learn from soccer, and vice versa? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-04-02 21:52:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a huge fan of both sports, though more-so the NFL.  

What the NFL could learn from soccer: 

If it meant 30% fewer ads on TV and somewhat shorter games, I think I would support sponsors on jerseys.  I'm finding three hour games harder to get through in the regular season.

The chanting.  Oh yes, the chanting.

What soccer could learn from the NFL: 

Instant Replay.  Here me out.  Only on penalties which draw a card, penalties in the box, or questionable goals.  The clock/play is *never* stopped.  There is a ref in a booth and he has only thirty seconds to review video and signal the ref on the field.  If play has continued in the meantime, the ref whistles the ball dead (on a successful reversal) and the play is re-set at the spot of the review.  

Also cheerleaders.  

Edit: Also oh my god I would love to see a World Cup All Star game.  (Or is that the same as watching a Manchester United match?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> For April Fool's, [/r/NFL](/r/NFL) and [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) recently played a joke and "switched places" and it's revived my interest in soccer.  I've always been very involved in the World Cups (last Cup I went to my local bar at 7 AM every day to watch the matches, good times).  

So I thought it was time to pick a foreign team to follow.  I've always been fascinated by Sweden, and my timezone works out so I can watch Swedish matches live.  (Watching Malmo v Gefle now)

And now I don't know what team to pick.  

I like teams that normally do just okay, but occasionally have the chance to be champions.  Teams that win all the time bore me.  

I had a friend who lived in Gothenburg.  I've seen the name Malmo a lot from following design.  Hmmm....

Edit: The largest factor is what teams I can watch from here in the US.  After a few weeks, the answer is few to none.  So someone in Sweden will have to marry me so I can move there and see the games. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Felt like crunching some numbers today.  An attempt at quantifying "What is the toughest division in the NFL?"   </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-03-29 20:52:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never been sure exactly how this was determined.  The AFC North routinely has 2 or more teams in the top 5 on defense.  Is that the only thing people are using to determine toughness?  **Edit** - The original title should have read -

"Felt like crunching some numbers today.  An attempt at quantifying **an aspect** of "What is the thoughest division in the NFL?"  I still think things like Total Defense rankings and intra-division records play a part as well, for instance.  

My idea: Find out how often each Division has played against eventual playoff appearing teams, and what their win percentages against those teams were.  Strength of schedule analysis, basically.  I analyzed the last 5 seasons.  

I've only done two Divisions so far -AFC North (generally considered tougher/toughest) and AFC West (generally considered weaker/weakest).  More Divisions coming soon.  (maybe)

[My spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqvV7vId7_QJdGpmVkZfZFByLVc2ZW5lV3l0NUJhNVE)

**If you don't want to open the link or read all the numbers, here's a basic summation** - 

The AFC North has played 41.25% of their games against teams that would eventually reach the playoffs.  

The AFC North has won 25.76% of games against opponents that would eventually reach the playoffs.

The AFC West has played 34.69% of their games against playoff teams.

The AFC West has won 27.03% of games against playoff teams. 

Edit: Added the NFC North also, which'll probably be it for now.  I'll finish the rest through the week and update.

The NFC North played  40% on the dot against future playoff teams.  

The NFC North won 30.47% of games against future playoff teams.  

**Some other interesting numbers that came out of this**

Cincinnati is the reason for the near-parity in numbers.  They've reached the playoffs twice in the last five years (increasing the total number of games against eventual playoff teams), but in three out of five seasons failed to win a single game against an eventual playoff team. (With a fourth season only having one win.)

The AFC West only had one season where they played more teams that would go on to the playoffs, in 2007, with 37.5% of their games against playoff teams (versus 26.6%).  However, they had a worse record against those teams.  (20.8% wins versus 23.5% wins.)

The AFC North had a better win % three out of five seasons. 

San Diego has played the least amount of games against eventual playoff teams.  Second is KC (26), and the rest are all 30+.

**TL;DR - Over the last five seasons, the AFCN has had tougher schedules compared to the AFCW, in terms of how often they play against teams eventually reaching the playoffs.  However, the AFCW has won 1.27% more games, basically tied.**

Edit: I was an idiot and did some math wrong on win%.  Updated.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Halfway through the final season of DS9 for the first time.  A long rambling affair of my thoughts on the show. [Sure to be spoilers.  I'm trying to be subtle but they'll show up.] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-03-26 11:21:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **First** It's thanks to you guys I watched this.  And, really, thank you.  A friend had downloaded it (he runs an ISP so I get my downloads through him...) and I was only a few episodes through the first season when his hard drive crashed.  "Oh well."  But because of your recommendations, I got them all again. (And to add to the preface, I'd seen TNG all the way through who knows how many times, and had just gone through VOY/ENT for the third/second time.)

**Ships** This comes to mind first.  There was talk the other day about the variety of Starfleet ships.  While I guess DS9 still uses mostly the same handful of models, this was the first series that gave any sense of scale within the show itself.  In TNG, within the individual races, it seemed all the ships were of the same size, even though I'd seen charts that said differently.  Seeing a Bird of Prey backdropped with a Battle Cruiser(?)...it made me appreciate the ships all the more.

**Next** I think part of the reason I didn't like the show originally was the semi-heavy religious aspect, what with the wormhole and prophets and all that.  It still rubs me a bit the wrong way...though maybe the final few episodes will change that...

**Something else** The Klingon episodes were...more tolerable...than other series.  Maybe after seeing the episodes 7-25 times (like with TNG) I'll grow as weary.  Even when that *one* Klingon came back, I thought I'd hate the episode, but it turned out allright. 

**On a critical note** I found the intrigue of the subtle manipulations of the races (the shapeshifters infiltrating various governments etc) in some ways much more interesting.  I freaking loved the battle scenes, don't get me wrong.  But it seems like Season 5 (I think?) peaked with the intrigue, and after that it became more or less typical war scenarios.  (The hour-long "Captain's Log" episode involving the Romulans was amazing though.)

**Holy shit, I end up liking Ferengi?!**  It's true.  I was so certain I'd hate Nog the most, but grew to love him.  Though apparently the explanation is because it wasn't a child actor, but a growth-stunted adult.  (TIL)

**The new Dax...** She's been in Cube, Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy, and now DS9?!  How does this woman not get more geek-love?  (Not saying I didn't love Jadzia, but de Boer beats the pants off Deschanel foer instance, whom I still can't figure out what the fascination is about.)  

**Oh sure, the usual "inconsistencies"** The shields are at 13% after a single shot, but manage to last another 15 shots and whatnot.  But we all know that's gonna happen.

**The genetically enhanced** Both the Dominion and those in Starfleet.  I'm glad to see a "hard sci-fi" topic tackled like this.  I always felt the lack of recognition of nano- and bio-tech hurt the other shows.  (Yeah Voyager had nanoprobes but...they never sat quite right with me either...also, granted, topics like this weren't quite so seriously considered at the time.)

**Love to Hate** The only semi-regular character I disliked was Jake, and even he had a good redeeming episode.  Alexander or Roxanna from TNG didn't, Neelix didn't and Kess was borderline, and the main characters in Enterprise were barely memorable enough as it is I can't recall the secondaries.

Okay, those are my 2,000 cents. </TEXT>

[runningblack](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/k7y3p/official_trash_talk_thread_week_1_go/c2i6a5j) makes a fairly accurate assessment of the 49'ers.

[taybme](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/k7y3p/official_trash_talk_thread_week_1_go/c2i77hd) had a similarly prescient view of the Cardinals' season.

and while we're on the division, [rabidoctopus](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/k7y3p/official_trash_talk_thread_week_1_go/c2idhem) sums up the NFC West.

[preludeoflight, bluefoot55, hot_soup, friendlyaussie, plink_plink, and trollyg-yo](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/k7y3p/official_trash_talk_thread_week_1_go/c2i6vse) make some good observations on quarterbacks.  

[rockon4life45 and lystrodom](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/k7y3p/official_trash_talk_thread_week_1_go/c2i61g5) show some faith in a rookie qb...in a way.

[keepswinging's](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/k7y3p/official_trash_talk_thread_week_1_go/c2i6tj1) comment still makes me laugh my ass off, and i'm pretty confident it came true.

[monkeysmarts](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/k7y3p/official_trash_talk_thread_week_1_go/c2i6rci) is right, they didn't *start* slow for once...

and finally, [arbysguy's](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/k7y3p/official_trash_talk_thread_week_1_go/c2i625n) comment is always true twice per season.

Also, a good excuse to go through the Week 1 trash talk thread again.  You guys made me laugh my ass off.

<TEXT> The first I believe the questions are obvious.  For the second, my (at least) five questions I'd personally have - 

1) How did the show/movie get clearance to use your face un-blurred? Were you told it was actually a Kazakhstani show?  Did they let you in on the joke after getting their bit?

2) How strong was your suspicion you were having the piss taken?

3) How long did he speak to you versus how much was shown?  Or put differently, did it seem like he was continually asking questions until he got a good joke, or was it one-and-done?

4) Did friends/family find out before you?  What was their reaction?  If you found out first, did you hope no one would see or show off to everyone?

5) And what was your segment (naturally)?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Howdy folks.

I decided to auto-resolve what was previously declared "round 2."  

If there were 4 or more nominations for a group, I took the winner of #1v#2 and the winner of #3v#4.  Now #1 is against #3.  No new nominations!  Upboat whom you like, downboat whom you don't, state your case for your pick if you want to sway the "audience."

If there were fewer than four nominations, I just picked #1 (who gets a "bye" this round), unless there was a tie.

The positions/players who are automatically advancing to the next round - 

DB - Brandon Boykin (Georgia)

RB - Robert Turbin (Utah State)

LB - Brian Hendricks (Wyoming)

TE - Michael Williams (Alabama)

Edit: **No New Nominations!** </TEXT>

<TEXT> [El Linko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_number_(American_football) )

What started this was seeing somewhere that QB's, place-kickers, and punters are all #1-19, and receivers are #80-89, unless those numbers are all taken, in which case they can be anything open in #10-19.  RB's and DB's share numbers?  wtf yo?

I still haven't gotten any closer to finding out why the numbering system seems downright silly.  

Still, some interesting trivia in there.  

Edit: Oh yeah, what really started this was trying to find rules on colors/helmet decorations.  Still browsing, but here's a [funny line (pg. 27)](http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/2011_Rule_Book.pdf) - "All pants must carry a small NFL Equipment logo on the front left groin area of the pants, midway between the fly opening and side seam" </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main reason I liked Voyager?  They seemed to really follow through the implications for certain technologies, at least much more so than other series.  

I'd have to go through the series again to come up with a proper list to back it up, and I'm sure there are a good number of examples in other series.

But what comes to mind is the very thorough exploration of holographic technology.  It was just a toy on TNG  (sans the occasional Moriarty episode or whatnot), hardly mentioned on DS9, did it even exist in Enterprise?  

A hologram trying to become "human" was formulaic at first, but quickly became similarly intriguing to an android becoming human.  Holograms physically (not just "computationally") taking over a ship, EMH taking over command...

Voyager seemed to have the best exploration of technologies, not people.  Probably part of why many find it very cardboard-acting and whatnot.  But part of why I enjoyed it quite fine.  

Here's to you, Voyager! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Could we assume that, despite no particular evidence, combadges contained some sort of neural circuitry? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-02-26 10:01:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The moment sparking this idea was a Personal Log in S02E17.  Sisko walkin around (like a pimp) and the "recording" overdubbed.  Got to thinking, maybe he's recording that log at that time just by thinking it.  

Other things that I thought about that made me think the idea has some merit : 

Picard is in the middle of some tense negotiations between two very hostile neighbors, the slightest mis-step could result in war. Suddenly, **SQWAK** RIKER TO PI---D HEAVY FIRE ......... *ATA DEAD* **SQWAK** 

That would be inconvenient eh?  Not to mention getting paged while trying to reroute a lady's tachyon pulse emitors would be muy frustrante.  Or when you're hanging out with friends and suddenly "Troi to Anotheranotherother, I need to sex u up long time," how could I explain that to my twelve other girlfriends?

So when Riker taps his manly chest and says "Riker to Picard," Picard hears the call internally (not that way pervert), not out loud.  It's not until Picard caresses his similarly masculine pectoral  that audio communication takes over.  (Two-way "telepathy" not possible, just a one-way signal only?)

Maybe there's some secret way to tap the combadge that's never been shown, that activates the Personal Log mental-recording.  Like long-press press.  

** *NEED MOAR?! * ** - Why would a neural connection go through the chest, rather than...the skull?  *fuck you buddy, thasswhy*.  Or, this also allows for remote monitoring of the entire body for medical purposes.  Combadges connect at the chest and establishe (French for "establish") nanofiber links to the heart/spinal column/funny bone/brain.

<DATE> 2012-02-24 05:44:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Inspired by the [snake-bitten](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/q321l/rnfl_i_would_love_to_know_your_opinion_on_this/) thread, had the idea of a bracket system we could do for "big questions" once in awhile.  

So here's how I see this working.  I'm going to pre-populate comments with the eight main position groups - Wide Receiver, Defensive Back, Running Back, Quaterback, Linebacker, Tight End, O-Line, D-Line.  You place your nominations under the comment for that position.  **Only** under the position-comment.  

The four "nominations" with the most upvotes proceed to the next round in a day or two.  

Round 2 - #1 v #2   #3 v #4 in each position group.  

Round 3 - Winner of #1v#2 v Winner of #3v#4

Round 4 - The "winner" of each group then faces the group following.  Winner of WR goes against winner of DB.  QB v RB.  LB v TE.  O-Line v D-Line.  

Round 5 - Winner of WRvDB v Winner of QBvRB.  LBvTE v OLvDL.  

Round 6 - The "winner" - for this particular question, who [/r/NFL](/r/NFL) seems to think has the most potential as a (probable) late-round pick.  

Yeah I know it probably sounds a bit confusing right now, and if I knew how to code I'd set something up.  Really though, it's just creating a thread every two days and seeing the top 4 comments per group.  

And with nominations, people can also state their cases, which would help spread football knowledge around.  So hey all you guys really gotta do is upvote and nominate someone if you feel like it. 

Future threads won't involve all this explanation. 

Without further adieu, let's start a bracket?

Edit: So I said a day or two, but nominations are still trickling in.  So I'm going to wait til the end of tonight.  Thanks for the contributions so far! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Guide to choosing an NFL team to cheer for (Contributions plenty welcome) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-02-21 23:17:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's a topic that comes up with some frequency, so let's set up a guide. (Primarily for foreign fans.)

**The r/NFL Guide to Picking a Team**

**1)** There's choosing whether you want to root for an annual contender, a middle-of-the-road team with potential, or one of the underdogs.  Based on the last ~10 years or so, and predicting the next few seasons. More details on each team provided at the very bottom.

*Annual Contenders - "sure" to reach the playoffs* - Baltimore Ravens, Pittsburgh Steelers, Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints, New England Patriots, New York Giants.

*So-So - could reach the playoffs, "guaranteed" 7-9 or better* - Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts, Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals, Houston Texans, Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, Tennessee Titans, Miami Dolphins, New York Jets, Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego Chargers, Denver Broncos, San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks.

*Definite Underdogs* - Cleveland Browns, Minnesota Vikings, Jacksonville Jaguars, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Buffalo Bills, Washington Redskins, Arizona Cardinals, St Louis Rams, Oakland Raiders.

**2)** Choose based on colors!  Or better for international folk, timezones.  [Kludgey started a timezone map, add your region!](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/pzxyb/guide_to_choosing_an_nfl_team_to_cheer_for/c3tmebz)

**3)** Based on rivalries.  Maybe you don't have a favorite team yet, but you do have a team you hate already?  

**4)** Big score teams.  You like seeing teams that put up a bunch of points?  NE, NO, GB, DET, HOU, SD are all pretty routine high-scorers.  Others that can often put up high scores include CAR, NYG, PHI, DAL, BUF, and ATL.

**5)** Find a divisional opponent of the team you don't like.  If you dislike the Steelers, cheer for the Ravens or Bengals.  Hate the Tebow phenomenon?  Cheer for the Dolphins or Bills.  

**6)** Follow a specific player you already know and like - When Drew Brees left the Chargers for the Saints, the Saints became my #2 team.  They're not in the same conference as the Chargers so there's no rivalry.  Or read up on some college prospects, see if there's one you like, follow the team that drafts him.

**7)** Follow a Division for a season, then pick a team from that Div.  AFC North is the "toughest" division.  Both West's are wacky, and who knows which team will make the playoffs from them.  Follow the NFC South next season, then choose one of the four teams you liked most.  

**8)** Location - You visited the States and really enjoyed Miami.  Cheer for the Dolphins why not?  Enjoy the NBA and cheer for the Celtics?  Cheer for another New England team then.


--

A very brief summary of teams and their potential next year (granted, the draft and free agency could change this in the next few months).  Also mentioning why I placed them in the contender/so-so/underdog status earlier.  

Also adding an extra note about team's "personality" or perception around the league.  (Bonus World Cup comparison!)

**Villain (V)** - Generally disliked by most of the league.  (Argentina, Netherlands, Italy)  
**Them (T)** - Hate playing against them, but respect them.  (Germany, Spain)  
**SeeSaw (SS)** - Up one game, down the next; Up one season, down the next.  (England, France)  
**Poor Bastards (PB)** - Teams that receive sympathy from other teams.  (Fiji, US)  
**Not Quites (NQ)** - They aren't as successful as people think they should be.  (US, Czech)   
**Under the Radars (UR)** - Generally not talked about much.    (Sweden, any African team)  
**Jokers (J)** - Generally entertaining for the wrong reasons.  (Italy, Brazil)  

* Arizona Cardinals (UR) - Underdog - Though they made the Super Bowl in the last decade, since losing the Hall of Fame QB that got them there, they've struggled.  This is likely to continue, but due to a weak division, always a chance they reach the playoffs.  

* Atlanta Falcons (T) - So-So - They've had some pretty good regular season success lately, and have a pretty talented team.  They can't seem to get it together in the playoffs, and their division is fairly tough.

* Baltimore Ravens (T) - Contender - Consistently reach the playoffs, great defense, an offense that can be frustratingly inconsistent.  

* Buffalo Bills (PB) - So-So - Mostly basement-dwellers, the Bills seem to finally be turning things around.  Injuries hurt the second half of last season. They could be threatening next season, they could also return to the bottom. 

* Carolina Panthers (UR/T after Cam) - So-So - Really, they're an Underdog team, playing in a division that has two teams (NO, ATL) that routinely makes the playoffs, making it more difficult for Carolina.  But after the showing last season, with a few key pickups this offseason, they could contend.

* Chicago Bears (T) - So-So - I'm sure I'll get plenty of flak for not naming them a Contender, which based on the past they are.  Based on the future, playing with GB, DET, and a new offensive scheme, it'll be challenging for the next few seasons.

* Cincinnati Bengals (SS) - So-So - If they played in another Division they'd have the potential to be Annual Contenders.  Almost always a very good defense.  Things look good for the future.

* Cleveland Browns (PB) - Underdog - Possibly the NFL's longest tenured underdog.  The future isn't terribly comforting.  

* Dallas Cowboys (NQ/J/V) - So-So - Usually have plenty of talent, but a meddling owner and a QB who seems to wilt at the worst times, despite otherwise putting up good numbers.

* Denver Broncos (NQ/SS) - So-So - They play in the AFC West.  Could go 3-13, could go 10-6.  With Manning now on the team the latter seems more likely.

* Detroit Lions (PB, until last year, but they went 0-16 so they'll always be PB really) - So-So - On the ascension, shoring up some Defense this offseason could get them in the Playoffs.

* Green Bay Packers (T) - Contender - They should be in the playoffs for most of the next decade, barring key injuries.  

* Houston Texans (NQ) - So-So - They've often had decent seasons, but it was only last year they finally got over the hump and made the playoffs.  Could frequently appear in the playoffs for the next few seasons.

* Indianapolis Colts (T/PB last year) - So-So - Contender, until a certain QB received a major injury.  While they're likely to get the "next Peyton Manning," last season showed a number of deficiencies and they've gone through a complete overhaul of their coaches/GMs.  

* Jacksonville Jaguars (PB/UR) - Underdog - QB questions.  Bad receivers.  But almost undoubtedly the best rushing team in the league.  Probably won't make the playoffs next season, but should do better than this last one.

* Kansas City Chiefs (SS) - So-So - Again, the AFC West, who knows?  But they could have a very scary defense for the next few years.

* Miami Dolphins (SS) - So-So - The start of last season made them appear to be Underdogs.  But a solid second half of the season shows promise for next.

* Minnesota Vikings (T) - Underdogs - Not exactly pushovers despite what their record last season says, they still look #4 in their Division.

* New England Patriots (V) - Contenders - Earned the ire of most of the league by winning 3 rings and falling one crazy stupid catch short of a perfect season.  While they haven't won another since, Patriots reaching the playoffs is one of the safest bets you can make.  

* New Orleans Saints (T) - Contenders - No denying they're an offensive juggernaut.  No question Brees will captain this ship for the next five years or so, and they should reach the playoffs each of those years.

* New York Giants (T/SS) - Contenders - True, they've had some disappointing seasons between their Bowl wins, but can't deny a team that's won two rings with the same QB/Coach.  

* New York Jets (J/V) - So-So - Even with the loudest coach in the league, they were one game from the Super Bowl two years out of the last three.  But the honeymoon with their QB seems over and without a solid showing next season, big changes could be on the way. (And in comes Tebow.)

* Oakland Raiders (V) - So-So - Again, AFC West.  And proud holders of the "Most Penalties in a Season" award.  

* Philadelphia Eagles (SS/J) - So-So - It's always a circus in Philly and you really can't know what to expect from them.

* Pittsburgh Steelers (T/V) - Contenders - Winning so much can lead to a lot of resentful fanbases.  But this offseason has some interesting question marks for next year.

* San Diego Chargers (NQ/SS) - So-So - Perennially disappointing.  Bonehead plays and missed field goals have ended many-a-promising season.

* San Francisco 49ers (PB, now T) - So-So - They finally found an answer to a decade of coaching problems.  Could easily be Contenders now.

* Seattle Seahawks (UR/SS) - So-So - Coach Carrol seems to have silently built a very solid foundation.  A few key acquisitions could result in a scary team.

* St. Louis Rams (PB) - Underdogs - I'm pretty sure the Rams are the poster boys for Poor Bastards.  They have a promising QB...maybe.  Still hard to see them better than fourth in their division.

* Tampa Bay Buccaneers (UR) - Underdogs - Two seasons ago looked great with a rookie QB.  Last season showed a definite regression.  With some coaching changes, could be So-So next year, could be Poor Bastards.

* Tennessee Titans (UR/SS) - So-So - The Titans probably won't do much with Hasselbeck at QB, but that should only last for another season or two while they continue to build up other positions.  But a pretty solid organization, it seems.

* Washington Redskins (PB/J) - Underdogs - When you change coaches and QBs on a near-annual basis, you can't expect too much success.  

--

These aren't my laws and my opinions aren't always right.  If you have other ideas for how to pick a team, if people think I really whiffed on an opinion or categorization, I'll update.  

Edit: Added addendum below. </TEXT>
</WRITING>
<WRITING>
<TITLE> People shouldn't play for at least 10 days after receiving a concussion.  Your thoughts on a 32 week regular season, with teams playing every other week? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-02-20 22:27:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Do you think it would lessen the game, that players would be too lazy with two weeks between games?  

Maybe it could improve things.  Pretend the Chargers have a week 9 game against the Panthers, followed by a Thursday game at KC.  They probably wouldn't game plan for the Panthers as much as they normally would, since they'd need to focus more on the divisional opponent on the short week.  With two weeks for every team, every game should have a good plan?

Would a 32 week season, but games only every other week, be more intolerable than a long offseason?

If it provided enough safety benefits that no new rules need to be created, what would your thoughts be then?  

Edit: Some points that have come up -

1) This would leave the postseason in the same format.  For teams that don't make the postseason, they have 17 weeks off (including 3 preseason games).  Teams reaching the Super Bowl have only 12 weeks off. 

2) A variation by ThaCarter - 18 game season, but with 6 bye weeks (I'm assuming spread evenly?).

Edit: Also, if you read the title a second time, did you change the pronunciation of "read"? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Peter King is still ragging on Wes Welker's drop.  Sorry, but doesn't it sound like the talk of a person who never tried to run a route and catch a pass? </TITLE>

<TEXT> The quote : "The fact is, that ball contacted the palms of both of Welker's hands cleanly, and he was not touched by a Giant defender. Call it a drop. Don't call it a drop. I don't care. But Wes Welker has to make that catch. Has to."

I know this is something of a dead horse, and it was already discussed shortly after the Super Bowl.  But King brings it up again, and so I will too.  

Ask NASA to design a robot that spins 270 degrees to catch an object travelling between 40-60 MPH(?) and they'll hand you a $600 million bill.  

If the ball was thrown to the correct spot, it's a catch Welker makes 100 out of 100 times, as Colinsworth said.  The sort of catch Welker is asked to make there?  More like one out of twenty, at best.

It's not that Welker should have made that catch.  Brady should have made the throw.  I agree there were other drops that fell on the receivers/TE's shoulders, but this is not one of them.   </TEXT>
