<TEXT> Just got a Galaxy S8 last week and can confirm the wireless charging thing works. It's a super snug fit and I got a [very thin case](http://www.otterbox.com/en-us/galaxy-s8/symmetry-series-clear-case/sam41-galaxy-s8.html) so that I could still fit my phone in there. But it's pointless because I also wanted to be able to use Android Auto and to do that, you need to be connected via USB cable so you're already charging.

When I 1st got the car, I was still on my ancient S4 which had an awesome case from EasyAcc but it didn't have Lollipop so couldn't do Auto and it wasn't wireless charging capable. But I thought I'd just stick it in there anyway since, compared to my Fusion hybrid I replaced, the Bolt has way too few storage places (no coin or sunglass holders!) But with the case on, it absolutely would not fit.

So, yes, it works, but if you want to listen to music on your phone w/o Bluetooth or you want to use GPS, it's pointless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And, in Grant's own words:
I always wanted to sleep with a black woman. Thats my fantasy. 

https://www.theguardian.com/film/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jun/26/hugh-grant-arrest-prostitute-divine-brown-20-1995

So, yeah, it was just a regular sort of "long way from home, got way too much time and money, and I'm in fuckin' Hollyweird... LET'S DO THIS!" situation.

Side note: The story of '[Divine Brown](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Estella_Marie_Thompson)' is sadly predictable:

 Thompson grew up in poverty in the eastern part of Oakland, California. She was one of six children of a single mother. Having herself become a mother of two girls, she turned to prostitution when she could not pay a $133 electricity bill. Going to Union Square in San Francisco one night, she earned $1,000 in five hours: "I just wanted the best for my children and I didn't want them to struggle as hard as I had, so I did what I had to do. I wanted to make money, you know, do the right thing ... go home and raise my children and just have a good life, a good quiet positive life."

On a less sensitive note, Estella must give great head - 
 According to Thompson, the attention of a policeman was alerted by Grant repeatedly pressing the brake pedal of his BMW with his foot, causing the brake lights to flash. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Picked it up at Lee Johnson in Kirkland, WA as a 3 year lease. They actually had 10-15 on the lot. Went there just to test drive a red LT but when we were working to the showroom, my wife and I passed by an Arctic Blue Premier and had to drive it. Yeah, that panoramic mirror and some of the other candy made me change my mind and she ended up driving home solo.

The buying experience itself wasn't too bad. The finance guy did the same spiel that has become part of the standard procedure now - rattling off a long list of optional upgrades like Lojack and clear coat paint protectant but this guy wasn't as pushy as some I've seen. The salesman himself was nice enough but, predictably, didn't know doodly squat about the Bolt. But, for once, he didn't try to BS his way through and admitted upfront that they had just gotten them in about a week before and he hadn't read much about them. Since I've been reading **everything** on the Bolt since October, that wasn't a problem. </TEXT>

If you want to retrieve the memories you made on the mattress, you'll need to do a Vulcan mindmeld with it. Sadly, the company does not allow you to order a Vulcan to help with this and you are on your own to procure one. Best of luck OP! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mother didn't cook at all; insisted it was cheaper to eat out. But that's another story...

Dad remarried and stepmom starts cooking for us. Occasionally, as a treat, she buys a can of asparagus. She then proceeds to boil the everlovin hell out of it. "I hate asparagus," I decided.

Years go by, meet girl, fall in love, shack up. We started a thing on the weekends - I cook the main dish and she does a couple of sides. One weekend we're going to grill and she throws some little green stick lookin' things on there. 

Me: Whut the hell is that?

SO: Asparagus.

Me: Don't look like no asparagus I've ever had. 

SO: Just wait.

Before serving, she melted a little butter, crushed a clove of garlic in then tossed the asparagus around in it. I discovered I never had actually tasted asparagus before because there was nothing left to taste in what I had been eating all those years.

And then there's spinach... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Damn. I just picked up a new Bolt this weekend and found this exact same issue. Came here hoping to find an answer but since you've only had one reply in two months, I guess that answer is "No."

I've noticed that the audio system becomes active and if I go in immediately, I can't choose Bluetooth as the source since it takes several additional seconds before it recognizes that my phone is available and reconnects. So I'm guessing it sees that Bluetooth was the last source but then it sees that the phone isn't connected and, instead of calling out to whatever routine connects Bluetooth, it just defaults back to SXM/FM.

Bummer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, no one could have seen that coming. Oh, wait...

 Some of the worst incidents in the U.S. were on the Trans Alaska Pipeline. Vandals blew up a section in 1978, spilling about 16,000 barrels of oil near Fairbanks. In 2001, a drunken man fired a hunting rifle into the pipeline near Livengood, causing more than 6,000 barrels to spray out.

 Some of the most notable incidents in Canada happened in the 1990s and 2000s in Alberta and British Columbia. A series of bombings in 2008-09 targeted pipelines in British Columbia. Weibo Ludwig, an Alberta man who crusaded against the extraction of sour gas containing high amounts of hydrogen sulfide, was convicted in several of the 1990s acts of vandalism. He was arrested but never charged in the later attacks.

 Pipeline sabotage happens with some regularity in war zones. Iraqi insurgents, Colombian rebels and Mexican guerrillas all have claimed responsibility for pipeline attacks in recent decades. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Kind Hearts and Coronets](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kind_Hearts_and_Coronets)

 Kind Hearts and Coronets is a British black comedy film of 1949. ... It concerns Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, the son of a woman disowned by her aristocratic family for marrying out of her social class. After her death Louis decides to gain revenge on the family, and to take the dukedom, by murdering the eight people ahead of him in succession to the title.

All of the people murdered by the central character are played by the same actor who also plays the central character/murderer. That actors name? ~~Albert Einstein~~ Sir Alec Guinness.

 Alec Guinness was originally offered only four D'Ascoyne parts, recollecting "I read [the screenplay] on a beach in France, collapsed with laughter on the first page, and didn't even bother to get to the end of the script. I went straight back to the hotel and sent a telegram saying, 'Why four parts? Why not eight!?'"; he eventually played nine parts. </TEXT>

http://www.kitploit.com/2013/09/iodine-tunnel-application-to-forward.html

 iodine lets you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS server. This can be usable in different situations where internet access is firewalled, but DNS queries are allowed. 

 It runs on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Windows and needs a TUN/TAP device. The bandwidth is asymmetrical with limited upstream and up to 1 Mbit/s downstream. 

...

 Each DNS reply can contain over a kilobyte of compressed payload data.

And from [this article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html) on the Trump Tower-Alfa Bank question:

 Eighty-seven percent of the DNS lookups involved the two Alfa Bank servers. Its pretty clear that its not an open mail server, Camp told me. These organizations are communicating in a way designed to block other people out.

Earlier this month, the group of computer scientists passed the logs to Paul Vixie. In the world of DNS experts, theres no higher authority. Vixie wrote central strands of the DNS code that makes the internet work. After studying the logs, he concluded, The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project.

...

Tea Leaves and his colleagues plotted the data from the logs on a timeline. What it illustrated was suggestive: The conversation between the Trump and Alfa servers appeared to follow the contours of political happenings in the United States. At election-related moments, the traffic peaked, according to Camp. There were considerably more DNS lookups, for instance, during the two conventions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, your answer is right there in your question:

 black ane white

Now, you obviously have a typo - you misadventurously plopped a space in "blackane white". And what is blackane? Consulting with [Dr. Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-ane) we see:
The suffix -ane is used in organic chemistry to form names of organic compounds where the -C-C- group has been attributed the highest priority

And what is the most famous -C-C- group? CCR, Creedence Clearwater Revival, of course! And like all classic rock bands, the formula for their success was:

Music originally created by black people + played by white people = commercial success

So, the problem isn't that the children aren't grey, it's that they aren't being given guitars and drum kits. Stop trying to get them to produce melanin and get them to produce hit singles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you're seeing is a side effect of partial abortions. Some people undergo this procedure during pregnancy. The entire fetus isn't destroyed, merely the brain which, as we all know, is just for cooling the blood so is nonessential. These hot-blooded individuals then go on to promote the rights of men to tell women, well, everything - see "mansplaining" for more details on that. </TEXT>

Just because someone else in the past got away with something illegal, immoral or unethical doesn't mean that everyone is excused to behave as badly as they want. If we're only going to enforce laws that no one has ever figured out how to weasel out of, then we might as well just stop having any laws at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  At this moment, we are four days away from Trump's inauguration. The FBI agents and analysts who monitored the calls, as well as some NSC officials in the Obama administration, along with a few senior Justice Department attorneys, all knew with certainty that the content of the calls contradicted Flynn's account of them. The transcript of the Dec. 30 call proved as much.

For reasons unclear to us, Comey did not believe that Flynn's misrepresentations amounted to a sufficient national security risk on January 16 to spring FBI investigators on the Trump team, or even on Flynn. Perhaps he felt that doing so right before the inauguration would have been too unseemly.

Nope, cannot for the life of me figure out what James Comey might want to shelter a high-level Trump staffer. Nope. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Jeffrey Sandusky is one of the six adopted children of Jerry Sandusky, the retired Penn State defensive coordinator whose 2011 arrest and 2012 conviction on 45 of 48 counts of child sex abuse crimes rocked the university and led to a major spotlight on pedophilia in Pennsylvania.

Headline doesn't make clear that he isn't a biological son. My money is on getting rather unpleasant details during the trial of what life was like in the Sandusky house when those kids were growing up. </TEXT>

https://twitter.com/RoguePOTUSStaff/status/831130748224667648

Sanction talk is missing the big picture. Flynn tapped for a reason. Boot him, POTUS will just replace w/ another conduit to Putin.

https://twitter.com/RoguePOTUSStaff/status/831128774976602112

Regarding Flynn, he's not going anywhere. Pence/Priebus camps may hate him by now, but POTUS is committed. And they think they know why.

And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber.

And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself.

And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own Midwest.

And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil.

One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. And terror possessed me then

And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?"


And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!

You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust."


And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared,

"Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you!

Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!"


Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus </TEXT>

It's happened before in good old New York City in 1863:
http://clevelandcivilwarroundtable.com/articles/society/nyc_riots.htm

The veterans of the Army of the Potomac imposed a hard peace.  Burrows and Wallace wrote, Troops assaulted infected districts, using howitzers loaded with grapeshot and canister...to mow down rioters, and engaged in fierce building-by-building firefights.  Rioters defended their barricaded domains with mad desperation.  Faced with tenement snipers and brick hurlers, soldiers broke down doors, bayoneted all who interfered, and drove occupants to the roof, from which many jumped to certain death below. </TEXT>

http://www.king5.com/news/local/white-center-woman-charged-with-hate-crime-after-posting-facebook-live/384841206

 A White Center woman has been charged with a hate crime after posting a live video on Facebook that prosecutors say shows her tailing a Hispanic woman in her car, railing against the other driver for being "Spanish privileged" and threatening to ram her vehicle. ... 

 Prosecutors say Jametski blamed one of the woman's children for causing a car accident a year earlier, though police records show Jametski was at fault.

 Jametski has pleaded not guilty.

All because this woman refuses to accept the fact that she herself was at fault in the initial accident. She's going to have a swell time in gen pop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ship's speed is measured in knots because it used to be measured by heaving a weighted wooden panel over the side. Tied to the panel was a rope which had the other end secured to the ship. The rope had evenly spaced knots and one sailor would count the knots that passed over his fingers while another watched a 30 second sand timer. When the time was up, they recorded the count of knots.

Even more fun fact. The error of doing this vs true nautical miles per hour was about 1.5%.

<TEXT>  When I got my first green item off one of those frost trolls, which I believe was a Journeyman's Robe, I had a little nerd moment and became very excited.

Yeah, 11 years ago and I can still remember how excited I was when my Druid got her first green drop from a mob. It was only +1 STA/SPI but it was leather and green and damn did I feel like a stud in that thing. Ely/Nost definitely brings that back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my favorite runs ever was back in TBC but with a new-ish toon, a warlock. Wanted to run Scarlet Monastery but having trouble finding a group. Hanging out in UC, someone said they were looking for 1 more, must be pet class. So I asked for an invite.

Turns out it was a group of 4 hunters. So, using hunter pets and VW as tanks and them self healing their own pets and me doing a health funnel on my VW, we proceed to wreck Lib and Arm; didn't try Cath because we were all sub-40. 

Good hunters are awesome; but for every good one, there's at least two that think it's just "Send in pet, Arcane, autoshot, Feign Death if my pet dies." </TEXT>

And the few terrorist attacks on India. And the human rights violations; what country doesn't have a few of those on their CV, amirite? Oh, and the [Benazir Bhutto incident](http://www.biography.com/people/benazir-bhutto-9211744) was a bit messy, sure.

<TEXT> Here's the recipe I use for the meltaways:
http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/mint-meltaways-recipe.html

And if you want to know the science behind why blending coconut oil and chocolate is a great idea:
http://sweets.seriouseats.com/2011/04/eutectics-chocolate-meltaways-science.html

TL;DR: Combining 2 fats lowers the melting point of both.

But, where to get the infused coconut oil? In order of easiness:

1) Live in a legal state? Check the menus in Leafly or Weedmaps for your local rec shops to see if any of them carry it. It will be weaker than homemade so you'll have to eat more chocolate to get the effect (the horror!)

2) Buy a Magical Butter Machine. Decarb an ounce of weed, throw it in with a jar of coconut oil and wait 2 hours. This is the route I go because I'm lazy. Sometimes stereotypes are true.

3) Follow this woman's process: http://www.wakeandbakecookbook.com/cannabis-infused-coconut-oil/  Takes longer than the MBM and won't extract as much THC into the oil but it will still beat what you can buy in a shop.

My favorite part of chocolate meltaways? No smell and they keep pretty much forever. Enjoy! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, because according to that story, God made all the animals male and female but he only made Adam. Then he realized Adam was going to need "a help mate" so he had every species of animal in the world parade in front of Adam (The math on how long that takes is left as an exercise for the reader.) Adam named them all but, being neither Welsh, a Kiwi, nor a member of Daesh, he didn't think any of them looked doable. Shame, the rest of the planet would have been much better off if one species had to be the sacrificial lamb or goat or whatever popped Adam's cork. Then humans would have never populated the Earth and Adam could have lived forever in a goat fucker's paradise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, a parable about a man of noble birth who is about to travel so that he can be appointed king. As part of the parable, his citizens hate him and try to stop  the appointment. Meanwhile, he gives some slaves  a bit of money to invest on his behalf.

So, in this story, who does the king represent? A noble who has left his home to be among those who hate him but he will soon be anointed King? Could it be Jesus? If not, who? And if it is Jesus, he is indeed talking about himself when he says that those who would not have him rule over them killed in front of him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abel didn't have sex with any one - he was dead.

Cain gets explained but that opens multiple plot holes. We all know about the banishment in Gen 4:
 Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand.  When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.

But, hey, God's a cool dude so when Cain is worried that "whoever finds me will kill me", God cuts him some slack:
  But the Lord said to him, Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over. Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.

So Cain sets off to wander the Earth until the day he dies, right? Well...
17 Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 

1) The world population of the Earth should be 3 - Adam, Eve, and Cain. Why is Cain worried about "other people" finding him and killing him?

2) Wife? Where the hell did Cain find a wife. Must of been one of the "other people".

3) Cain built a city? But he's wandering the world with, now presumably, his wife. Why is he building cities? He's got a curse laid on him to wander. He ain't got time for building no damn cities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had thought on 1st viewing the ship/alien blew up way too easily also. Then I watched it with someone else and brought that up and he proposed an explanation. Remember the big green clouds of gas that it spews out? That stuff is highly flammable. Inside the ship there's big tanks, bladders, or what have you. There's no open flames inside - aliens have better tech that doesn't require something as primitive as fire. So once that improvised molotov cocktail lands inside there - KAFOOM! So MEW didn't take out the thing because of any great skill or because whisky is super explosive. It was pure dumb luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Similar case - years ago I went to the animal shelter for a cat. Little black male looked cute so I bent down to give him a scratch under the chin. When I reached my hand near, he thrust his front paws on either side of it through the chain link and then wrapped them (claws withdrawn) around the finger I was going to scratch him with. He didn't let go so I figured I was his now. </TEXT>

It should have been Kiss a few months earlier but about a week before the concert, one of those travelling preachers came to town and our church arranged for him to speak to a group of parents. All the usual stuff Kings in Satan's Service; they consecrate (desecrate?) a guitar to Satan before the show and then leave it at a pawn shop to corrupt some poor innocent child, etc.

<TEXT> The part I find interesting is that 2015 was when they had the 3-tiered taxation system - 25% at each step from grower to processor to retail - plus 10% sales tax but then 2016 they simplified that to just a 37% excise tax plus 10% if you aren't a MMJ patient. That amounted to a huge reduction in the tax rate which has contributed to the plummeting prices (all the new growers has undoubtedly done more for that) which actually lead to more than a doubling of the total tax collected. At least they figured that out eventually. And it let OR see what **not** to do. </TEXT>

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Harry_J._Anslinger#/The_campaign_against_marijuana_1930.E2.80.931937


 Anslinger had not been active in this process until approximately 1930. Prior to the end of alcohol prohibition, Anslinger had claimed that cannabis was not a problem, did not harm people, and there is no more absurd fallacy than the idea it makes people violent. His critics argue he shifted not due to objective evidence but due to the obsolescence of the Department of Prohibition he headed when alcohol prohibition ceased - seeking a new Prohibition. Of 30 leading scientists whose views he sought, 29 said cannabis did no harm. However, Anslinger chose to pursue only the views of the one who did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brought up in a strongly fundamentalist home and raised on a steady diet of Jack Chick tracts and the like. About the time I started 10th grade, our church created a school using the Accelerated Christian Education system (based out of Texas, naturally) so I was attending church every day as part of the school program plus evenings on Sunday and Wednesday. 

But after college, the deeper I got into scripture the more troubling things I noticed; like Luke 19:27 or Ezekiel explaining that Sodom was destroyed for not being good hosts and not because of homosexuality. Speaking of that story, the whole thing with Lot having sex with his daughters and how it was clearly just propaganda to justify the Israelite's campaign of genocide against Edom and Moab.

But I started stumbling across things in the early days of The Web like a Rice University professor's page on 500 Things Creationists Hate (which I can't find now - sad) and Thomas Jefferson's views on Jesus and that got me devouring the old back issues of Biblical Errancy and popping into Farrell Till's Yahoo group. Discovered Robert Ingersoll and bought the CD of his collected works and read through most of it.

That all happened over the course of a good 4 or 5 years so it wasn't just, "I believed for 38 years, woke up one day and now I don't believe in any Sky Daddy." But by the time I was 38, I was wholly decided that, as Laplace might have told Napoleon, "I had no need of that hypothesis."

Funny enough, my wife actually pushed that process along by asking me why evolution being true was so problematic. That lead me to an FAQ on the Answers in Genesis site that basically laid out the argument that if Adam   Eve weren't the 1st humans and others had died before him, then God lied when he said that eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge would make them die. Obviously, they didn't drop dead right away so what God *really* meant was death would enter the world when it hadn't existed before. If things - including proto-humans - had lived and died previously, God's a liar (and I thoroughly enjoyed the Skeptic's Annotated Bible's section on "Does God Lie" by then).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> For people who don't understand why porn stars and sex workers in general consider him "one of them":

Ireland's Ballyhoo Examiner newspaper has issued the following "correction" to a previously published article: "Lawyers for wild man rock star Lemmy have complained about a story in Saturday's Ballyhoo Examiner entitled 'MOTORHEAD's Lemmy In Bondage Romp', which told how the 55-year-old MOTORHEAD rocker handcuffed his lover to the bed for a three-day sex and bondage session. Mr. Lemmy's solicitors said: 'It was not three days and she was not handcuffed to the bed. It was seven days and she was hung from the ceiling.' We apologise unreservedly to Mr. Lemmy for any damage caused to his reputation."
