<TEXT> When Harry Potter was big and someone went around telling everyone Dumbledore died, people were literally crying, it kills the adventure cause you know whats going to happen. 

If you check the Game of Thrones Reddit, it's very strict on not letting people spoil stuff, I think all post have to say of they contain spoilers or not.

What about if you go to read The Wasp Factory and you find out the main character is really a "...." the entire time, it would have killed it for the reader.

Or when I read Flowers for Algernon, I didn't know what it was about, but if I read the synopsis or looked anything up, it would have spoiled what was going to happen, and the regression wouldn't have been as impact if I knew it was coming.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'll spoil it for yourself. 

This isn't even slightly a joke, I was interested in seeing what Frank Herbert had to say about Dune and watched an interview, and it wasn't even to Frank Herbert's part yet and the host told what the whole series was about, and it just ruined what was coming after book 1.

Also I looked up something about Old Man and the Sea while I was taking a break reading it, and someone's review gave away the ending I'm their first sentence. 

I was on Reddit and someone gave awww the ending to Gone Girl in their title post lol. 

Last one doesn't really come, but is still true, so have you had anything ruined by just looking up something about what you want to read? Do you have book LPTs? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't if it's because I saw the movie first or what not, but I felt it was just ok. I don't know if there's something I'm missing, but it was enjoyable, just not this superb masterful work which I was going in expecting. I feel that he's like Hemingway with kinda short to the point stuff, which I suppose is a good thing, but McCarty being one of the top American authors right now, I think I was wanting...a bit more. Though it could just be The Road, I've got All The Pretty Horses on my shelf that I'll read sometime soon and then Blood Meridian when I get a chance to pick it up. 

But it reminds me of The Old Man and The Sea, another Pulitzer prize winner, and another book I went into with high hopes, and another book I felt kinda let down after. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand what makes either masterpieces. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I liked how they built the guy up to be this big mythical creature and turns out he's and old withering dying dude.

I feel that it was important for the story to show that even legends can die and I think it parallels with the story, because the story gets you all pumped and then when you meet him there's almost a small disappointment, just like the main character felt. 

Also I enjoy how book shows how someone can just completely lose themselves and take a back seat from the real world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes books can really put your life into perspective.

For example, The Girl Next Door by Jack Ketchum, though based on true events it's still a fictional book. But after reading that and reading what that poor little girl weren't through, I stopped and told myself "I can never complain again in my life" because no matter what happens, I will never have had to go through what that child went through. It also made me realize though I may not be perfect, at least I'm not a monster, the way some people can just fall in line and do those things, no thank you. It helped me gain a new respect for the person I am. </TEXT>

Just take it one page at a time, don't get discouraged because it'll take a long time, but just remember, you're reading the equivalent of like 3 books. In fact I think in The Stand there are books 1,2,3 lol. 

Or do like I did, read War and Peace (which is amazing btw) and then just realize pretty much everything else is smaller than that ^^ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get the ending, but I didn't like it. The story isn't about the house, it's about that lady becoming obsessed with the house, she became "haunted" by it, hence The Haunting of Hill House, so she didn't want to leave, she was in love, enthralled, ravaged by it, so the other people who are just like, "hey it's a creepy house and you're crazy now lady" are able to just take in what's happening, the girl was the weak one of the bunch, the easily influenced, so the house took her, and when she was almost to get freedom, she gave it away for love. How many love stories have ended with a character giving everything for lost love?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So first of all, wtf with this damn book, I mean seriously wtf did I just read. 

Ok so my thoughts, if I'm able to find a way to put this into words. I feel that the story represents a misspent youth and Frank is trying to imitate Eric to some extent. With the animal mutilations, his rituals, his worshipping of the wasp factory itself and it's predictions, the connection he wishes to share with Eric and his hatred of women to find out later he's the thing he hated the most and everything he did was for nothing. I feel that there is an undertone to the story that it's never too late to change even if you're forced into that change. Eric was forced into the change with the maggots in the baby's brains, the father was forced into a change when Frank was a girl and he wanted him to be a boy and when Paul was just dropped off from the mother, and Frank was changed when he found out that he is really a girl. So I think all through story, all of the terrible things that happen are all symbolism for the bad that needs to be let go before you can grow into the person that you really are. Maybe it's also a telling of letting nature take its natural course for example with the wasp factory and the wasps deciding their own deaths. But it also might be about your inner subconscious taking over because there were moments when Frank had clarity and knew certain situations were wrong.

Please, anyone who has suffered through this book, what's your take? </TEXT>

The Exorcist did not scare me at all and The Haunting of Hill House was beyond a let down. I haven't read Heart Shaped Box yet.

The two books that have actually made me feel uneasy though were American Psycho and The Girl Next Door.

Also just for good measure, the book Psycho by Robert Bloch was pretty unsettling and cemented Norman Bates as my favorite bad guy ever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I had put off reading The Exorcist because quite frankly, I was scared to read it. I was getting myself all pumped and yesterday I decided to read through the book. So I started and it moved very quickly and was enjoyable but I was never scared, even at like 2am even while I was reading and all the creepy stuff was happening, I just never felt scared. I was hoping to be terrified, I was yearning for chills down my spine, but nope, nothing. I was told by many people that this book was supposed to be one of the scariest ones out there, so now I'm in a lull because I'm afraid I won't find something to make me...afraid. 

I'm thinking about picking up Legion though because I'd like to see where the author took the story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, although they don't have to be read in any order, start with the first one because it explains what the Books of Blood are, which makes the rest great

This is the order


Books of Blood 1,2,3

Inhuman condition

In the flesh

Cabal


When you finish Cabal you can move on to Great and Secret Show, then Everville because the character from the last books of blood story is the main character in those books.

Also Imajica is amazing. Also lol what made you pick up Weaveworld? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So once again Clive Barker has moved me in such a magical way. This book was an absolute blast, it was a super quick read, really fun and pretty emotional at times. For all his dark gritty over sexualized writing, this book, this children's book he wrote, has to be one of the best stories I've read. I've had a smile on my face the entire time, and I'm busy in awe. It just goes to show how diverse of a writer he is. Such a good book and I cannot recommend it enough. Everyone, do yourself a favor, go out and buy The Thief of Always right now and just devour it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just finished Solaris, I really enjoyed it but I would not recommend it </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-15 08:46:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It was a phenomenal little book, but there are too many issues with it to make it something I'd actually recommend someone to read. Sop I actually started this last year and got like 20 pages in and gave up, I picked it up again a couple days and forced myself though the whole thing, and just wow. The actual story is amazing, the problem is that the book veers too much in certain chapters into the what Solaris is and people's theories about it, and these couple segments really really really slow everything down and it gets so convoluted that you get to a point where you're just reading words and have no idea what's going on. So I think due to that alone I wouldn't suggest it, but the actually story part is very good, deep and emotional, inn really glad I read it and if anyone else has suffered through it, what were your thoughts? </TEXT>

Flowers for Algernon

The Handmaids Tale

The Haunting of Hill House

I liked Flowers for Algernon best, it's up there for favorite books of all time. Hill House was...ok.

The Handmaids Tale I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would and read it mainly because I didn't want it spoiled by everyone talking about it....though the way people talk about it makes me think, they either didn't read it, or didn't understand what it was saying, because the book, despite what everyone plays it out to be, it was not a feminist agenda based book, which I thought it was going to be. But, that's as much as I'll say because, Reddit is Reddit and yeah.  </TEXT>

This book took me way longer to finish than I wanted it to, and there were parts that dragged a little too long, but those last couple chapters, they just made it all worth it and I almost had tears in my eyes when Pie takes Gentle off into the world of spirits. I know this isn't going to be a book that many will read, but those who have read it, lemme know what you thought.

Also Ease was my favorite character by far though he had such a small role, and even Dowd and Sartori tug at the heart strings when there parts ended. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really not a versus but, I ended picking up the first book of each of these series and I'm excited about getting into them. I have ASOIAF, Mistborn trilogy and the first 6 Dune books. So my plan was to read each see which I like best and then start to collect the rest, hopefully I'll really enjoy them all.

Right now I think Dresden Files is the one I'm most excited for, it seems like the underdog but everyone who's read it has really enjoyed it.

I'm thinking about also picking up Malazaan and Night Angel, but not sure.

<TEXT> Mine was the start of a divorce.

I wasn't much of a reader, in fact I didn't even fit into that 1 book a year category, I fit into the Netflix and videogames all the time facebooking category. But as the ex wife and I were starting to have troubles in our marriage I needed to get away from it all and I started reading. It helped me escape the pain I knew was coming and allowed me to sit and enjoy whatever last moments we were going to have together. Inevitably the divorce did eventually happen and the moving and the separation, and when we parted ways I was just done with everyone and everything, I got rid of my videogames, told her to keep the big tv and deleted my social media. I said goodbye to it all, and I read. It started slow and was tedious, but it became part of my normal day. The lessons I've learned from what I've read helped me understand better about who I am and the divorce, the way people work and think, and just made the coping easier for me. I'm at about a book or two..or three a week that I read, still no tv, still no social media, and really I just browse r/books mostly now.

So, what brought you into the world of books? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to go with War and Peace here, though I've never meet irl anyone else who has actually read it. But I will say that people get it wrong for a couple of reasons. 

1) most people who haven't read the book, don't even know what it's about, not even a basic concept of it, they've just heard it's really boring.

2) people who do know what it's about, think that's it's all about war, and it's not, not even close.

So, yes there is war, and yes it's a catalyst for the story, but the title is symbolism. The "War and Peace" in War and Peace is the internal struggles of the characters, basically, being a human being, having your ups and downs and the complications of life and loving and love and loss, disappointment, pain, struggles, sorrows, sacrifice, you name it it's in there. And it's also about his philosophy and the struggle he has with history and the way things are told and the complications of telling of these leaders and how things have been played out and how things will shape the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I love the "Story" part of story, and even his thoughts on history I didn't mind. But what left a sour taste, and don't worry no spoilers, was that I was so connected to the characters that when I finished the first epilogue I was thankful that I could have a little more time with everyone in epilogue part 2, but no, the second epilogue is just his philosophy on history. Which if I would have know the story story was done at the end of the first epilogue, I would have tried to hold onto it a little longer.


So OP if you want the story part, only read the first epilogue :)  </TEXT>

I'm more interested in his short stories and I traded in like 15 of the books which I didn't think I was going to read :/

But I'm excited for Dark Tower, I liked the comic, the next of his actual novels I'm going to read is IT, also I just bought 11/22/63 for like 3 bucks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I read a really long book and then several smaller books, I just finished War and Peace earlier this year, it's like 1400 pages, took me 3 months to get through it, I'm halfway through Imajica (850 pages) and I've only been reading it for about 10 days. 

Which is dumb because I read Flowers for Algernon in one day (300+ pages) and it's taken me 10 days to do that with Imajica, which is even more dumb because if I could do 300+ a day War and Peace should have only taken me like 5 days.

But what's even more dumb, is while I was reading War and Peace, I read 5 other books as well.

So, I think it all depends on if you're into the story or not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The abortion scene was the most evil thing in that book to me lol. It didn't have any blood or gore, but it showed how vile he could be and his mockery of the girls suffering by leaving baby items, it still make me wince thinking about it.

Though, I loved the book and when it got extremely gross and disturbing I honestly was cracking up at a lot of the ridiculousness of it all, and thankfully I read it after I saw the movie so Christian Bale was in my head the entire time, which was amazing.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Frankenstein was really got me into reading, but recently Flowers for Algernon might have topped that, it was the first full length novel that I finished all in one day. 

One thing I like to do is read books that they've made movies out of and then spout the differences, I just recently read Psycho and it blew my mind how amazing it was. Also I have Jaws, The Exorcist, First Blood (rambo), Jurassic Park, and several other big movie books, they're quick and fun.

Also Brandon Sanderson really got me into fantasy so maybe check out some of his stuff.

And Richard Matheson and Clive Barker really got me into short stories, also Clive Barker is probably one of the most amazing writers out there.

Also Haruki Murakami is really good, and I think Cormic McCarthy is considered one of the greatest living writers right now.

But, here's a list of books by everyone I mentioned and a couple others that you might like.

Weaveworld - Barker

Imajica - Barker

Books of blood - Barker

Norwegian wood - Murakami

Windup Bird Chronicles - Murakami

The Road - McCarthy

Blood Meridian - McCarthy

Mistborn trilogy - Sanderson

Hell house - Matheson

I am legend - Matheson

The collector - John Fowels

Do androids dream of electric sheep - Philip K Dick

Dune - Frank Herbert

Frankenstein - M. Shelley

Flowers for Algernon - Daniel Keyes

These should be fun reads, for me at least they were, just a simple start.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I think the price is $300 but every website has it listed somewhat differently, so I thought I'd check gamestop because even sold out they'd at least have the price up, well gamestop's website only has a $522 bundle listed and I think most the stuff bundled isn't even out yet. Amazon has them listed for about $400 and I stopped checking after that, Nintendo's website says $299,  but the retailers all have different prices and Nintendo doesn't have a way for me to just order off their site.

The sucky thing is I'm not even trying to buy one right now, I'm literally just trying to window shop. I was thinking maybe in May, but now lol I'm kinda over it all. I just wanted something that wouldn't require me to have a tv, might as well get a vita and just play ps1 games lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember color theory, you just use the primaries, yellow red blue, you can make almost everything from those, minus white.

To darken say red, use green, to darken yellow use purple, to darken blue use orange. To make black mix all to make brown then mix in more blue. 

Drawmixpaint made a good video about limited palettes. 

With watercolor though I use several different reds, blues, greens yellows and browns, it's a little too much to do all your mixing with the watercolor. 

But with gouache or oil, I only use the primary colors, if you look at my past posts I did a Nightcrawler painting that only used primary colors.

<TEXT> Or anyone else I suppose, so lately I've been posting some fantasy art on here of some little mice characters I've made up, and people seem to enjoy than, so I've been coming up with a story idea and I was just wondering if I could get any tips on how to bring a little mice world alive. I've got some general ideas for the overarching story, what the purpose is for why things are happening, the world the little mice are in and all that, I just don't know how to push it into more than an idea. 

So Brandon, if you read this, lol would you mind talking to me a bit. If you don't read this, would anyone who is familiar with his work and world building have any good resources or ideas on how to build a story? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since I do most of my book buying at half price books I'm usually saving a pretty good amount on my reading material and I don't know if I've really ever bought a new book. I usually think about $10 is on the high end and I'm usually reluctant unless it's something I've really been looking for. Though I paid $50 for the ASOIF set new from Barnes and noble, they had it on sale for 50% off, the little leather bound set, but for one single book I think the most I paid was $18, and it was for the three book version of 1Q84. 

What's the most expensive book you've bought, or I guess even just own? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So a friend of mine let me borrow a book called The Book Thief, which I haven't read so no spoilers please, he told me a little about it and I know they made a movie, so in my mind I have a semi rough idea of what the contents are. 

Now today I was in half price books and I decided to go to the YA section to look for some Redwall books, and while I'm back there what do I see? Copies of The Book Thief, and I'm a bit confused because I was telling myself "I've seen this book on top books you should read lists, my buddy suggested this book and he's not a YA reader" and so I asked him and he said it wasn't a YA book. 

So I'm assuming it's somewhat on the same level and tone as maybe Lovely Bones, a fairly serious book that isn't over the top explicit, and that's not considered YA. 

So with all the YA posts I've seen on here lately I thought I'd join the bandwagon and ask, what constitutes a book as YA, are there any that you don't consider YA that are considered YA? Or vice versa? </TEXT>

Also, don't let the size intimidate you, it's kinda big, but there are bigger books out there. I think the P V translation, the one with the soft blue cover, is around 1100 pages, I'm not sure how, probably spacing and different font and different translation, but that might be a good option if you want to trick yourself into a smaller book.

Also, War and Peace is freaking awesome, I'd say skip the second epilogue and just enjoy it, it's amazing and epic and sad and powerful and tragic and everything you can imagine.  </TEXT>

http://www.listchallenges.com/centaur-editions-the-100-greatest-novels-of




Every classic I've read had stuck with me one way or another, I don't know how to explain it, it might seem boring but it's what happening behind the scenes that makes the story really stick out. Like War and Peace, it really deals with the internal struggles of the characters more than the actual war. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to read Redwall and that's considered YA. I don't know if I actually own any YA books, nor do I browse the YA section at the bookstore. 

I think the thing comes down to people might not consider it worth reading, or maybe it's thought of as just filler. Like, what would teens know about good writing. But that being said, I haven't read any as far as I know, though couldn't Discworld be in that category? The lite fun books. 

I know some people who read only YA stuff and they compare it trashy romance novels where it's not refined in anyway it's just something to pass the time.  </TEXT>

But, it is what it is, I better read The Handmaids Tale before the story gets ruined for me by everyone talking about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now I've read books in one day before, but smaller things like Heart of Darkness, Yellow Wallpaper, Psycho. But this was my first novel in one day, usually it takes me 2 or 3 days, but I couldn't stop. I wasn't actually intending to read this right now, I just wanted a small book to take with me to the dog park and right away I was sucked in. It flew by and my heat was ripped completely out of my chest by the end of it. I have never felt such sadness, and I think it could be the best book I've ever read, so far.

I just don't know what I could even begin say about the story and what it's done to me, and I feel almost a small guilt that I haven't read it before. 

Whether you know what the story is about or not, read it, just consume it and then step back and take a look at yourself and just think for a bit.

Any thoughts on the story? Anyone read a novel in a day? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was me like a year or 2 ago, I needed a change, I quit videogames, quit watching tv and made myself read.I stared slow, now I'm at like a book or two a week, I don't have a tv or at home internet anymore and I don't even miss them.

I started with books I've already seen the movie for, Dracula was the first, that way I had an idea of what was going on. And then slowly gravitated towards things I never saw the movie for 1984, Moby Dick, and then the momentum just kinda takes over, I think once you actually start getting into reading regularly your brain starts comprehending things easier and your imagination becomes more vivid.

So, maybe start with books they made movies out of. I know someone recommend I should try some easier books like Jurassic Park lol and I've yet to get to it, though I do have it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Barnes and noble doesn't even have a horror section and half price books usually only has one small area. I think people enjoy reading horror, but maybe not. I have a buddy of mine who writes horror books and he says it's a very niche market. But people enjoy horror movies right? Anyway it was just something I was thinking about, when I go to half price and browse the little horror section I know that even if it's something I haven't heard of, it's still horror. But at the bigger stores it's just mixed with fiction or scifi, and it might make it harder to just come across a new horror book you've never heard of.

Do you think it's a popular genre? Do you have a favorite scary book? Recommendations for authors? </TEXT>

The philosophy is the actual book book isn't bad, if you wanna read about Napoleon invading Russia then you might get what he's talking about better, it's just the second epilogue I had a problem with, he talks about the way history is written and just kinda beats a dead horse, but the rest of the book is amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What an amazing amazing book. I loved the story, all the characters, well most of them, but I didn't like any if the philosophy, or I should say not all of it.

I will say though my absolute favorite character in the book was Denisov, I thought he was the most decent of everyone, his accent and his little charming self really sold him.

I will also say that the title War and Peace isn't about the war, though the war is in there, it's about the internal struggle the characters are facing during the story.

Now the boring part, well only one really, the second epilogue, I would say, if you going in for the story part of the book, avoid the second epilogue because it has nothing to do with the story and is all philosophy on history.

That being said, I know it's the most talked about book that nobody reads and I cannot understand why, the book was not boring, except for second epilogue, it didn't feel like anything dragged on, and I think Tolstoy captured what being a human and all your errors is all about perfectly, I also feel that there was way too much relatable material in the book that is going on now. 

Who else read this? Did you glisten with joy when you finished? Did you cry? Laugh? Weep? Do you know someone else irl who has read this? Cause I don't lol. </TEXT>

I'm cute

I'm fun

I'm nerdy

I'm weird

I'm quirky

I'm like really smart

I'm amazing at this thing

I'm this thing or that thing


And I just think...no you're not, because if you have to say you're this thing, you're not.

It's especially bad on dating sites when you see someone say, "I'm just a real cute down to earth funny nerd."  



*Also people who say

I'm the nicest person you'll ever meet, I'm not an asshole

I'm not racist

I'm not homophobic

I'm not gay

I just don't understand why people have to try and justify who they are instead of letting other people figure it out.

** And people who say

I never lie

Trust me

I hate talking about myself

I always get a lot of attention

I don't know why everyone compliments me, like complete strangers just seem to want to come up and tell me something nice all the time

Animals love me, (which is a damn lie because cats are dicks and love no one, they only allow you to be near them)

<TEXT> I take the small yellow legal pad, I start from the bottom, count 4 lines up and tear horizontally. It's the perfect size, I then write on the little yellow bookmark the day I start reading, and then I'll write the day I'm finished. 

I keep the side that has the date written on it facing towards the book on the opposite page from what I'm reading so when I close the book I remember which side I was on.

For example, reading page 98, I'll have the bookmark on page 99, with the date facing down on page 99, so if I close the book and open later, I see the date is on the page 99 side and then know I was reading page 98.

Yes, it's dumb, but it works.

<TEXT> I liked this quote, and I'm sure Stephen king will go in the history books if for nothing else besides many of his books being best sellers. He created a whole little universe inside Maine pretty much, and his ideas are pretty good. But, that being said, when you write like a million things, not all of it's good, so it is what it is. 

Now poor Dean Kootz probably has just as many, if not more books than Stephen king and literally no one knows any of his stuff. And I bet you can name 5-10 Stephen king books without even having to try hard.

Carrie

Cujo

<TEXT> Jekyll and Hyde is only about 100 pages long. 

I go to book store and just check if they're abridged or not, I guess you could do that to get a page count and compare to a kindle book, but I don't know how kindle stuff works. Though at the bookstores, like half price, there's usual several copies of the same things, find the biggest one and look at the page count. 

For example, I've seen a ton of like 800 page copies of Count of Monte Cristo, but that books around 1300 pages. I think 1277 to be a little more specific. 

If kindle let's you select publishers, go with penguin cause I think everything is unabridged. 

Also try this

<TEXT> As I'm beginning to see the finish line of War and Peace (only 600 pages left) it got me wondering, what's the longest book others have read?

For me, at least until I finish this, it was Count of Monte Cristo, which I think is still around 1277 pages, this being 1388, and hopefully one day it'll be In Search of Lost Time.

Also what's your strategy for tackling these huge tomes, if you have one. For me I write the day I start on a little bookmark and then the day I finish, this was stated December 1st and hopefully will be done before the end of February. </TEXT>

I already own o copy of The Divine Comedy, it's translated by someone named Oakley I believe, I never made my way through it because poetry is difficult for me, but I felt with what I skimmed over in this version, it was easier for me to understand, so hopefully I'll finally make my way through. </TEXT>

<TITLE> To me Nier was the saddest game I've ever played </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I first heard of Nier nobody could explain what it was or what made it special. Everything about it was generic, but it still had something to it.

But I want to break this down for people unfamiliar with it. The sorry starts off sparse, in fact when you beat it, nothing is really explained, until you start a new game. Now there are 4 different endings to the game, but here's where Nier shines, slowly unveiling the story. 

See your first play through, you're the hero doing hero things and fighting the bad guys, fun stuff right, oh there's a giant wolf Ha, easy fight.

Beat the game.

Second play through, wait...what, why do these things I'm killing have backstories, wait...what am I doing.

Third play through...wait...no..Roc...

Fourth play through...I hate literally everything.

I don't want to spoil too much, but I know when people talk about their saddest games, I don't ever see this one mentioned.

Do you have any hidden gems or unknown games that you feel hit you emotionally?

Both good choices though, Frankenstein is my personal favorite book of all time ^^. Just check the books to make sure they're not abridged, I know Count of Monte Cristo gets cut down a lot, so if you ever go for that one, remember it's around 1300 pages not 800 lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just finished this and boy was it amazing. I get that the story is about her being trapped and having a mental breakdown, and I'm wondering, was the ending left open ended for the reader to experience the mental breakdown as well leaving them unsure of what exactly happened?

To me, I think she hangs herself and it's her shadow creeping around the room. Because in the beginning of the story she talks about this being "dead paper" so I figured she's dead telling the story. 

But then I also think she just accepts the room and becomes one with it but also being free.

But then I think she's just walking around the room, but if that's the case, she can't get past the bed to circle the room, so thats why I think she's dead because her shadow can fit nicely in the corners and what not.

So...I'm confused, but it was an awesome read. </TEXT>

<TITLE> War and Peace, Anthony Briggs version, errors in the text? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-10 03:40:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just wondering if anyone else has found errors in the text, now I'm not a smart man lol, but I've noticed little things here and there and there was one page, I don't remember which, which had several errors. I feel like this book was edited just fine for the most part, but some of it feels like they might have just kinda given up for the day. 


Page 430.

Denisov clapped him on the shoulder, and started pacing rapidly up and down the room without looking at Rostov, something he often did at times of high emotion. 'Oh weally,' [*she*] said, 'you Wostovs are such a cwazy bweed,' and Rostov could see that Denisov had tears in his eyes. 


Now that's just a small example, but Denisov being called a she took me out of the story. There's many more examples I've come along while reading, but this one is just where I'm at in the book. 



Has anyone else noticed this w/ this edition? Is there a way to let the publisher know, would they care? 


Also I find this kinda funny because I haven't actually met someone who has read War and Peace, so it makes me think maybe the editors didn't read it either. Though that's a bit of an exaggeration since it's like 1400 pages they're editing and people do make mistakes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry about the confusion, this wasn't supposed to be another warrioress picture, this was supposed to be another fantasy themed picture, more of a seductive elven woman.

And yes, she's mostly nude, because right now I'm focusing on retraining myself in figure study. Also this picture is supposed to give into the stereotype that fantasy art is supposed to be pointy ears and boobs, the title "Too long without a woman", is a play on the fact that people believe nerdy guys draw sexy women because they can't get girlfriends. 

I posted this in fantasy because, I'm working on improving my artwork and the feedback I get from fantasy is much better than the feedback I get from art, and also because I'm trying to work on doing fantasy artwork, although it may be lite themed in this picture.     </TEXT>

For me, with a real book, I guess I feel since I went out, and purchased the book, and am physically holding it, that I've mentally committed myself to reading it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bristol paper is essentially...thicker paper. It comes in smooth (hot press), textured (cold press), and vellum (smooth on one side, rough on the other). 

Hot press is smooth because the heat in the rollers smooths out the edges, cold doesn't.

I don't think there is a smoothest paper because all bands and what not offer smooth versions. For example, I use watercolor paper, which is a thicker paper and designed to soak up water. So when I use Arches brand, the paper is 100% cotton, so it's extremely strong and good for all mediums. 

But I could also use bristol, which is good for most mediums, but, it's not as strong as cotton. Both though offer a smooth and rough version. It's just on what you like and want to do. 

If you like traditional stuff, maybe textured, if you like illustration and super high detail, maybe smooth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you, this was a little practice thing I did at work. I'm actually really surprised it's as popular as it is, I thought any of the other paintings I posted would have been better received, but people like what they like.

And yes it's wet on wet, do a clean outline, fill in the colors, light colors first and then darken them up for detail. 

I'll have to find some other little sketch paintings to put up on here.  </TEXT>
