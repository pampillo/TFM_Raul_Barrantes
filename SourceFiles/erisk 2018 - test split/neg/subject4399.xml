<TEXT> Mp14 player here. Honestly , KD doesn't mean anything to me. I play for fun with silly setups , just cause I enjoiy the game. Sometimes,  people come in my lobby and laugh at my KD being a MP rank. I laugh at them, post lobby after I wreck them. Take a look at my stats. Its shitty. Below 1 KD for a MP14 player. Being master prestige only means you've invested time into the game to rank up so high. I learned to play cod when mw3 released. What I'm trying to say is, being MP doesn't necessarily mean itl reflect a positive KD. it's the player and his skills. I can pick up any gun with ANY setup at lvl1 top the leaderboard of the match.

<TEXT> Agree. I went off topic and detail into people asking for buffs and nerfs and that's all they're doing instead of fixing the current procrastinated problems like lobby connections. Instead, they're just giving us weapons and buffing and nerfing and messing up the gun balance as well as making epic , 4000k salvage pretty much useless. My bad if I came off like a dick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not my first post, but for almost 2 weeks a few rounds and BAM! lost connection to host/server/connection timed out. 

People say, " don't play co-op, play solo " . I've tried playing solo SEVERAL times , only to loose connection to myself. What? How? My internet is excellent. It must be YOUR shitty servers infinity ward. 

What's  the point of paying $100 For a game, only to have it BOOT you all the time with it's abysmal servers? I feel robbed. Play zombies, they said. Grind 400 keys easy, they said. 

You keep patching " glitches and exploits " so that players won't farm keys EASILY, just to protect your money, but you can't get decent , stable servers? Come on, people. 

People are going to say, " its not their servers, it's YOUR connection " . I live in NYC with Verizon FIOS and I pay extra for more speed. I did a speed test.

When are you going to FIX the servers IW????? 

When are you going to start awarding keys for certain rounds just IN CASE the servers go down? 

When INFINITY WARD? WHEN ACTIVISION?  </TEXT>

Everyone complains about this and nothing gets done about it. But cry OP on mp guns and shit gets nerfed right away. Only reason I'm bringing it up once again is to get the 400 keys to open the QM drop. So I turn to zombies. But no, the game wants to f**k me. 

Keys should be awarded by checkpoints/rounds/milestones just in case of this connection crap. God dammit, Bobby. 

Note: first match I went to round 32...

Second match...29....


No keys for all that time. Thanks IW.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bro. It's  the controller. Call PS and if it's still under warranty. They will replace it. I should mention that you have to provide proof of purchase. I didn't keep my receipt from 3 yrs ago. So I went to target and bought a controller for 44.99 and spent $5 on a 2yr protection plan. Ds4 has a tendency to stop working after a few months with the sprint thumbstick. Trust me. This is your best option. 

I bought it last week.

Anything happens within 2 years. They fix it or replace it. 

Also, I should mention, you get the newest ds4. The one with the light on the swipe pad that comes with ps4 pro.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if you guys are familiar with Zynga poker, but whenever someone loses a big chunk of money, someone else or the person who won the pot might send him a " sad looking tissue box " as a joke because he lost. Can we get some sort of lobby emojis we can send other players that we can buy using salvage? And have it stay next to the players name for like a few mins unless he buys himself something else to replace the " tissue box ". This would be hilarious with all the shit talkers who loses. Maybe I can send a rose to a girl in the lobby or something. Again, using salvage. 10/20/30/40 and so fourth depending on the item/gift itself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> okay, i get, SP holders get it free and reg users do challenges to get it. everybody wins. 


or do they?

remember when they brought out the first sets of weapons?
they had it as craftable, but it was soo early in the game, not that many people had salavge to craft them. 


skip ahead 4 months, now they're giving away the base weapons and everybody is applauding them for basically giving it away for free but dont even notice they added the BEST variants of it behind RNG, while a majority is sitting on a ton of salavge. I'm personally sitting on 9,386 salvage after crafting the flatline,chaos,bomber,cyclopean,corruption,invective and r3kt.


when exactly are they going to put craftable epic weapons? or they plan on stopping that, giving us base weapons and have the epic counterparts locked behind supplydrops? </TEXT>

<TEXT> i have a shitty Kd because i rush and dont play tactically ( most of the time). i dont care about kd because it takes away the fun from the game. last week, ( i have proof if anyone want to see ), ran into a clan shit talkers with 2/3 kds out to get nukes. i simply said, you wont get a nuke in my lobby. they were laughing at me because i had a .8 kd. game ended. no nukes were dropped. i went 42-10 and i stopped all their nuke streaks. they called me a bitch and left the lobby. they rejoined a new lobby ( lobby shopping ) , they saw me and left. HC KC.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-03-06 19:18:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> perfect example is the key glitch back in december where players were exploiting your poorly written codes to get infinite keys and somehow you MOVED within hours to get this patched as quickly as possible and for damage control , you diluted the supplydrop system with 600+ items , not only punishing the ones  that did the glitch by banning them for a few days , but punishing your loyal customers by spending our hard earned keys on POORLY ported camos ripped straight from emblems. which by the way you have not commented if you're ever going to fix them. 


secondly, you put out this triple play bundle which CLEARLY states, each hack will be dupe protected. so what does your loyal customers do? pay for cod points and got duplicate items from your QM   MK2 Hacks. you've made no attempt to update and remove the dupe protected description nor tweeted out a compensation for those that purchased cod points. instead, you let your goons tweet at people who complained that said " sorry, its not dupe protected,  sorry for the confusion ". 


You people have no shame or integrity as a developer. 

i found the perfect CC to describe you scums. 

https://imgur.com/OUJF3VC

this clearly looks like eric hirshberg, ceo of activision 
scheming on how he can manipulate   rob his loyal cod community out of their money with by having their rng system 
described with FALSE advertising.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> to begin, i have all the ORIGINAL QM guns EXCEPT the PROSPERITY. even have the mk2 versions of most of them, including string theory, wasteland, bosozuku and most of the common ones. anyways,  i plan on buying 5000 cp to get 2 chances at the triple play. now, im hearing that QM hacks are infact, NOT dupe protected as it says it is, is this true? does this goes for the mk2 hacks as well? IS THE TRIPLE PLAY NOT DUPE PROTECTED AS IT CLAIMS? should i take my $40 and go buy horizon zero dawn instead?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm mostly an S n D player, so usually tactical play is always a must. now my question is...if a player is in a room/spot aiming at a particular spot because he knows theres an enemy coming, mentally hes ready, trigger happy ready, just waiting...BUTTT the guy thats running into the room/spot with no idea what position the other guy is in, usually gets the kill. ...dont blame lag, ive been that dude ADSING many times at a corner knowing an enemy is coming, but the guy that turns the corner kills me first. 



doesnt this happen to u guys also? its weird...i feel like its a  momentum thing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Where my VERY FIRST match won't start because it kicks me out the lobby with error  rejected connection request 

* 50% of my post match lobby kicks me out with error
 could not migrate host. 

* after action medal report shows my total number of medals 
 instead of x medals earned in that match 

* partying up with friends makes everyone restart game every few matches because 
 the " lock " icon comes on and unable to find match even though I'm the party leader


* can't get 2xp right. It's always delayed 2-4 hours later. 

* quantity over quality.  600+ camos that's been ported/ripped from emblems. Its doesn't show properly. 

* the list goes on. Now, I'm primarily a ps4 user , But I DO feel for my Xbox and pc brothers. Its baffles me how a player that paid the same amount of money for a game ,not receive the support they deserve or still experiencing bugs and glitches that's been addressed on ps4 months ago. 

One last thing, the daily bonus for season pass holders. Why is it random? You have players get 40/40 salvage, 5/5 keys daily but other players are getting 30/120 keys, 30/30 keys. Why not have a set daily login bonus for everyone? 

Mon - 40/40 salvage

Tues - 80/80 salvage

Wed - 5/5 keys or 1/1 common

Thurs - 10 keys / 100 salvage

Friday - 30/30 keys

Sat - rare/rare drop

Sun - 30/120 keys 


Why not? That way it's fair for everyone.

Been grinding for diamonds for AR's 2 weeks now. Finally got it just now. It was crazy because I only had the type 2 left for 20 triple kills and I needed 10 more. I got all 10 in 1 match and the game gave me like 31,000 xp because I also got my diamond camo. I had a few xp tokens on my account and decided to double up.

<TITLE> Why doesn't obtaining a mark2 version automatically unlock it's prototype counterpart? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-14 16:42:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For example, I wanted to buy the R3kT , but I didn't unlock the legendary " gambit " variant, so I would need to spend 6k salvage. 2k for the legendary + 4k for R3kT. However, opening a supply drop got me the mark2 version of the " gambit, so I am able to save 2k and the r3kt automatically becomes available for just 4k salvage. ( even though the prototype gambit is still locked  for 2k salvage). So again, I have alot of epics I am able to buy for only 4k because I have the mark2 versions of the respective legendary. It should automatically unlock the prototype version. Who in their right mind would spend 2k salvage if they already have the epic version   mark2 version of the legendary ? No one. Another example of this is the kbar,  why not unlock the bunker buster if you GAVE everyone the same gun for Christmas with a different name? ( igloo buster ).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why are season pass holders getting the same shitty bonus as non seasonpass holders? I mean I know technically we are getting twice as much as them, but if they are getting 40 salvage, why are we getting the same value? I mean come on, give them 40 give us 80. With a total of 120. If they are getting 1 common, give us the 1 common, but give the the SP holders a rare. If they are getting 30 keys, give us the daily bonus of 30 keys, but SP holders 60 with a total of 90. Dont just MATCH what you give them, give us our daily and it be 2x for season pass. I feel like people who buys/owns season don't get treated the way we use to anymore. It's not " exclusive " . We are paying alot ( I am personally a cod seasonpass holder veteran since mw3 ). Change up the system.  </TEXT>

Omfg, OHHHMERRRGEERRRDD. I was getting over 30+ kills with this gun. I was outgunning FLATLINES,  kbars and shooting people from across the map. Very high fire rate but deadly accuracy. Players were cursing at me on mic. Come on bruh, it's just a pistol.  Or is it?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what I have.  I'm curious to know what you guys have. 
I also decided to share my mark2's as well. 

16 - epics
19 - mark2's 

Album: https://imgur.com/a/mzPNx

I'm not trying to show off or anything. Just also wanted to share the weapons I have in case anyone was interested. 3 months into the game, I want to know if anyone has gotten all or almost all the epics. And before someone comments and say " dude, where's the flatline" I don't have it. I don't want to buy it. That gun is SOO overused. I'd rather spend money on other weapons. I'm a hardcore S n D player and all I see is FLATLINES, i like to piss people off when I kill them with something other than the flatline. Maybe I'll get lucky and get it from a supplydrop or even the mark2 version , until then, I'll buy other epics. Thanks for reading.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rare vs common - save your salvage   2xkeys </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-05 17:46:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Many times , I've seen people ask, should they open common or rare drops, which is better? I'm here to show you that opening Commons are a better bang for your buck. Why? Because the supply drop system is random. 30 keys for a rare only guarntees you a rare item which will most likely give you a calling card or taunts   gestures and a salvage bonus. With the introduction of 600+ items, common drops will almost always give you new calling cards or emblems and will occasionally every few drops give you weapons. When the new update came out, I opened up Commons only and was presently surprised by the amount of weapons I got. Now, even though they're offering 2xkeys, IW being Activisions puppets, DECREASED the drop rate for weapons , especially mark2's so that no one will have a high chance of getting good weapons. So I urge you to save your keys and salvage after this 2xkeys weekend has ended and the drop rate is normal. After, the 2xkeys went live, I've opened about 75 Commons and didn't get a single weapon or anything epic. With all the keys that you saved and everything's back to normal, before you spend your salvage on a weapon, you just might get lucky, and get a mark2 version of an epic you were going to craft anyway. So just sit tight and bank your 2xkeys. Here is some pics of weapons I got with common drops around a 3 week period before 2xkeys went live.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been posting for days about this error. No one would help me  and I know a few of you are experiencing this issue as well. After some extensive tinkering, i found a solution that worked for me and may work for you as well. Before I begin, i just want to mention that I did own the digital deluxe edition on ps4. 

* I tried rebuilding database. That didn't work. 
* I tried deleting and reinstalling the game. Didnt work. 

Here's what worked for me. 

* though, itl be frustrating for some, I re-initialized my ps4. 

Go to settings, all the way at the bottom " initialization ". 
Initialize ps4  Quick. 


This will delete data from system storage and restore ps4 to factory settings. Then just re-enter psn info and go to psn store and re-download IW and dlc1. Putting IW to dl, will automatically DL MWR, cancel/pause that for maximum download speed for IW. 

* SIDE NOTE: Use the PS+ CLOUD free backup before this process if you want your other content or game data saved. 


Thanks IW and Activision for not helping me.

They know only to come on reddit when people are praising them. I'm looking at you, Vulcan and Lee. But , won't come on to address obviously a big issue that's affecting many players. 

I've been getting this error since 12am Tuesday.

I bought the digital deluxe edition on ps4. I preloaded on Monday. 

35 hrs later, still can't play. But, what can I do? Nothing. They dont care about people like me or the community for that matter. They won't even tweet an ETA or some type of compensation for having us go through this. These people are criminals who take our money and shit on the little guys. Never again infinity ward,  never again. I honestly,  deep down from the bottom of my heart, hate you guys. Bye.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before anyone gets on my case and says " it's perfect now, because it deters key farming ", here me out. I think the algorithm/code is TOO sensitive. Sometimes my little brother as well as cousins, come over and the only form of entertainment they enjoy is zombies because they think it's " cool " AND IT IS. but they just want to run around and have fun. Granted they can't kill a zombie if their life depend on it and they enjoy talking on mic. ( they're not the type to use profanity), however the game thinks they're key farming and kicks them out because they're not " involved enough in the game ". People here might say it's fine the way it is because they'd rather not shitty players as a teammate and I strongly agree, but I'm just here to voice my opinion and let IW know that I think they kind of went overboard on the sensitivity. Thanks for reading.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> LPT - How to RANK UP FAST in DROPZONE! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-20 22:50:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With the introduction of drop zone, comes many opportunities for ranking up tremendously. First thing you need to do is create a class, I use ghost+blind eye, along with cold-blooded. Use any other perks you want. The reason for this is to keep you protected from air and ground scorestreaks. Secondly, by now, most of you will have a variation of a mark2 weapon. Of course, this grants an extra 15% or xp per kill. If you don't have any mark2, use the Volk-greed or if possible the Volk variant with the mo money perk. Thirdly, use the spartan launcher. With your class protecting you from air and ground streaks, you shouldn't have any issues taking out streaks. This game mode will almost have streaks up 80% of the time. ( it's the whole point of dropzone ) . If you have a point left over, equip a lethal grenade. This will clear out dropzones. And lastly, use Warfighter rig with the combat focus payload, this grants extra score while getting your streaks faster as well. You can use uav   cuav only. With only 2 streaks, you get em faster and you'll always have uav and cuav countering enemies that might get an AUAV in a care package. I hope this thread helps many of you rank up quicker. Enjoy everyone.  </TEXT>

And besides , what about the genuine players that just wants to spin around like a headless chicken,  IW can't BAN them because they think they're manipulating the game with rubber bands just because they're spinning around shooting because they would be loosing players. 
People paid for the game and are entitled to player however they want privately or publicly. Hence , nothing can be done about this. This also irritates me because I encounter this all the time, but I've made my peace with it and just find new lobbies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's ridiculous that players that don't have any nuke guns or maybe the only nuke guns they have is a sniper or a pistol that wants to get a de-atomizer, can't get one. I also think it's ridiculous that players with non nuke guns that manages to get 25 gunstreak isn't awarded a fancy animated ' nuclear ' calling card ( like the cool de-atomizer one ). We should get one!! Or screw make it a 30 GS and have us call in a MOAB. Lol jk. Just give us the non de-atomizer fancy animated calling card. We want to be cool too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played all day today and most of my lobbies, for some reason, people had the ' mauler - sentinel '. At first i was like, wtf just killed me. This 1 dude kept killing me over and over and im a pretty good player. SO, I WHIPPED OUT my EBR800-BOMBER.   NV4 CHAOS and this dude still kept shitting on me. Even from across the map. I dont want this gun nerfed or anything, im just here to praise it. Whoever have it, enjoy. The gun is a beast. Im 500 salvage away from getting it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bro. Bro. Bro. I have the fallout, flatline   chaos. I got pics to prove if u want. These guns, i dont even use. I use only 1 ar.. The kbar.. It has very fast firerate. Thats all i need in a gun. And i mostly use smgs. Any gun is great in the hands of a skilled player though.. Nothing needs to be done about the nv4. I slay good players that use them. I even have the ebr800 bomber, its a 1 shot kill. I dont even use it. People hate when i use it, in fact... Ive seen many posts here about it being a beast of a weapon, no one has mentioned to nerf it though. Get over it. Girls are funny. 

Stop crying, grow a pair... Equip an nv4 and go kill some motherfuckers.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Crossover maps? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-08 03:34:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I hope that one day our favorite maps from ANY COD will be used in any current cod. I mean, for example, if i had my way, I'd make a " crossover playlist" and in this playlist will be strictly boots on the ground to keep the older maps original. 


* cod4 - shipment, Bog, crash 
* mw2 - rust, favela, terminal 
* mw3 - dome, hardhat, village 
* ghosts - lol none ( maybe freight) 
* bo1 - firing range, jungle, nuketown 
* bo2 - raid, standoff, plaza 
* aw - greenband, comeback, solar
* bo3 - combine, evac, fringe 

Note: they had the right idea in ghosts to being back the original favela as a dlc, but they already messed up because no one wanted to play that game to begin with much less buy a dlc for 1 map. 

Note 2: why do this when they already reimagine fan fav maps? Because they suck at reimagining maps. No reimagine map has ever had the same nostalgic feeling. Perfect example, terminal in IW, EVERY TIME I RESPAWN, I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE **** I AM. Secondly, they come as dlc, people hardly buys dlc nowadays.

Note 3: why should activision waste money on bringing back old maps in a playlist form instead of dlc and probably no one will play the shipped maps. First, who cares if people play shipped maps or not, if the crossover playlist is heavly populated and the game sells, thats all that matters. Secondly, give the people this playlist and dlc will sell. 


If guns can come in the form of dlc, i dont see why a crossover playlist cant be implemented. People will say it wont work because its different studios and different codes, colors ect.... Oh please, you better believe if activision wants this to happen, itl happen. All these studios are puppets and activision holds the string.

<DATE> 2016-11-12 18:51:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If we do decent. We usually get around 2.5 keys. I believe the key earning rate should be adjusted. For example: miles traveled INCONJUNCTION with kills earned, flag caps, hardpoint held, flag running, defending, bomb plants   defused AND kills confirmed. This will prevent camping   getting kills only as well as solo players playing the obj. Season pass owners SHOULD get atleast 2- 5 keys for daily logins as well. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A fun idea... Flawless bonus map. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-22 00:25:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This idea came from chris smoove years ago. Basically he says, there should be a map called " flawless. But i will add my personal touch. There will no obstruction on the map. For example, no houses/headglitches/cars...you get the idea. The map will be small, like the size of BOG from cod4. Both team spawns directly across from each other and countdown begins....now, to win... A member of whichever team must kill all 6 of the players on the enemy team for his team to win. But, to make winning possible, there will be spawn delay. Also, enemies remaining for YOU will be outlined in red. IT doesnt matter if a guy you killed spawns back, he wont be outlined in red. If you have remaining 5 guys left, they need to die for you to win for your team. If you get killed by an enemy, your 6 man resets. So basically, you have to kill ALL the enemies, if you kill 1, 5 will be highlighted red for YOU. BETTER USE THE ADVANCED MOMENTS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE TO WIN. Do you guys get where im going with this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, infinity ward games always look bland. There's not really any colors to make the game look vibrant like treyarchs games. The camos don't even stand out. No attention to detail whatsoever. It looks like it was just dipped in paint. The lobby looks plain AS EFF. I HATE infinity wards color schemes. The ttk is too fast. If I get shot in the back, I can't turn around to do anything. And to me, the create a class as well as the armory are way to small. It needs to be a little larger. I have to squint to see what I'm picking or reading in the gun variant section. These people had 3 years to make a great title, instead they're adding useless stuff like a sequence screen after you select a loadout. Why? I hope those aren't all the streaks in the full game. Speaking of which, what's with the streaks? It also looks bland. The advanced moment feels clunky. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure how Xbox works but if you buy any dlc and proceed to buy season pass, I don't think you get anything back. Which is why it's always worth buying season pass. I always do. Just like the psn store and in-game store says, if you purchase season, don't buy individual dlc as you will be billed additionally. Every single cod game, I always buy the digital deluxe edition.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your style depends on the mode u play. I'm a super rusher. I play only hc kc. So that suits me good. Sometimes my friends invite me to hc snd....i rush every game and first to die. Eventually i started NOT rushing in  s n d and been winning matches. Dom isnt a rushing either. When i use to rush in dom, i would make the spawns flip every time. Just cap home flag and dont rush pass B flag. U keep them trapped at their spawn. But im a rusher, i hate camping and waiting. I have no patience. So i play hc kc 90% of time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's no game statistics. I believe you're referring to the cry babies who don't have the skills to use them. You think the guy who killed them said " omg, i just killed that guy so easy, this thing needs a nerf "  , no. It's the ones who die by a specialist and of course the latency in a public match.  Sometimes I run out of a room and look left instead of right and that's my mistake. People have unlucky deaths and blame the specialist weapons. Then they look for something to blame. I've heard many people complain about the marshall, I've died from the marshall 16 about 5-6 times and I play everyday online. I was lucky enough to get the marshall 16 the same day it dropped and people kill me all the time whilst I used it as a primary. That just goes to show MAYBE I didn't have the skills enough to wield it for it to be OP in my enemies eyes. I don't care enough to whine about any specialist weapons that killed me though because I think it's silly and I think the ones who do just have way to much time on their hands.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello ALL, please tell me HOW you got your bloodthirstys for this gun. I'm a decent top scoring solo player 90% on my team. I've gotten all my guns and knife diamond EXCEPT the argus. This mother fucking pain in the ass gun is frustrating the fuck out of me. I played about 2 weeks str8 and still haven't even got 1 bloodthirsty yet. I get trips consistently and the occasional 4 piece dinner, but the final kill never comes. I always get spawn flipped, lag spiked, latency,  outgunned, hitmarkered, no ammo, choked, wrong button, annihilated, katnissed, electricuted, tubed, naded, knifed, mistakes were made, c4'd, trip mined, semtexed, streak'd   my personal favorite, team killed and never get that 5th kill. I play HC only, gung ho for hip fire, dead silence, 6th sense, ghost,  fast hands and awareness. Please help. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dark Matter toggle HUD </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-23 16:59:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all, I know going after darkmatter can be a bit frustrating. Sometimes people don't know how good they did with a specific weapon until after a match is over until they see the medals and try and figure out what challeneges are left to complete that specific gun. What if treyarch had a DM toggle that users can enable in options that if they select a specific gun, there is a small hud on the upper right hand corner of the screen that will display, in real time, how many headshots are left or how many more bloodthirstys, kills left to complete that specific gun. Its kind of a hassell to wait til the end of the match to view earned medals and then go into the gun camo option to see what challenges are left. Also, I find it very ridiculous that all the other challenges are locked until the headshots and one shot one kills are completed. Sometimes when I'm on a streak with a good lobby, i get multiple bloodthirstys, but they don't count because i haven't gotten my 100 headshots yet. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-05-20 14:40:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> People have said that adding every game mode would dilute the playerbase in mutiple playlist that would cause longer match making. Okay, but why keep playlist/game mode that no one plays in the game still? People cant find matches. Here's what to do, for 2 weeks, add all the gamemodes that people have been asking for. At the end of every match for the duration, add a message that says " did u enjoy this playlist? " let the people vote. After the 2 weeks. Just permanently add in the most voted/populated playlist. Yay or nay? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Controller problem </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-30 00:42:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Firstly, I doubt that this is the correct section to post this , but I know you guys are super smart and maybe you could lend a hand. So, when I play bo3 or any other Cods for that matter, usually we press down the left thumbstick and hit forward the same time to sprint forward when playing. I've noticed recently that when I sprint forward recently, sometimes the character just walks instead of sprinting. It kinda sticks sometimes. Before I never had a problem with sprinting,  But idk, recently its just becoming a major issue and I'm loosing matches because of this. I bought a new controller and SOMETIMES I get the problem, sometimes I don't. Its weird. I'm usually laying down when I play. Maybe its because of the angle? Do you guys sometimes encounter this? Lastnight I took my controller apart and swapped thumbsticks. It worked for like an hour then reverted back to the same issue. I feel like i have to press down on the thumbstick harder for the character to start sprinting with no issues. Any help or suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Season pass vs. Super pass </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-27 06:13:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Theres been alot of good ideas on how the way supplydrops should be delt with and other forms of new system that should be implemented for us as the consumer/customer can be happy with. That being said, essentially like it or not, they're all pay to win in some way, shape or form. But then again, I don't nessessarily believe that because I still shit on people that has the shadowclaw, garand and Marshall 16. Back in the days, season pass use to mean something. For being a loyal customer that wanted everything out of the game, we would purchase the season pass and it came with a ton of bonus content. Now, all u get is maps and a shitty remake. Pipeline remake was GARBAGE and I don't know who keeps telling treyarch to remake nuketown. Thats all the season the has to offer us now. If thats the case, just fucking take out supplydrops and add a super pass that guarantees us ALL DLC/EVERYTHING. season pass is maps only. And super pass, all camos, skins, maps, guns, mele, basically every item in the game. Lets face it everyone, this is what COD has come to. Atleast this way, we get what we want and these asshole gets their money. I wouldn't mind spending and extra $99 or $149.99 ontop of the base game if it means atleast ill get my hands of everything in the game from cradle to grave. Thank you all for listening. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-03-17 18:59:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, ever since bo2, they've been adding DLC weapons in the games. I've always been a season pass holder in almost all the cods and I STRONGLY believe we season pass holders should Get all dlc weapons...guns/meele included while non pass holders get em thru micro transactions or supplydrops. Now, Bo3 is just throwing every new weapon in supplydrops. Why not just up the season pass by $10 ($60) total value and get all dlc weapons or just have a weapons season pass for $19.99 ...and non pass holders get em thru supplydrops. Either way its a win/win for them and US. But this would be pay to win, right. You're right. Like it or not, cod has become pay to win. They need to remove suppydrops and put everything dlc in pass holders hands and aesthetics as microtransactions. If they want to bring back Cod points, fine. But supplydrops should be in a way that..each microtransactions should be something like...1.99 for a camo or 2000 cod points. And supply drops would give u random cods points only...1 drop...3..10..7....would be a total of 20 CP...towards that 2000 cp/1.99 microtransaction item. Cp shouldnt be bought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if you guys are aware, but Microsoft has announced that they're working on cross platform multi-player. Which means xbox guys and ps4 guys can now play together. What does this mean for cod? The player base will be huge. Maybe now, in future cod, we all can have all the modes in cod. Would this mean dedis will be a permanent thing? Or this does cross platform is only limited to certain titles? This is good for pc players because their community is very low. What do you guys think about this? I don't have a source available right now, but its all over the web. I believe it was announced a few days now. </TEXT>

What about innovative stuff within the next 3 years for COD. we've already seen jetpacks and people want to go back to BOTG. has supply drops taken a permanent position? Will we travel from planet to planet for battles in the near cod? Could there possibly be a master modern warfare collection? Black ops master collection. Both collections with dedis and patched exploits with included dlc? Maybe, maybe not. I've heard that infinity ward will be using the same engine used to make COD AW....ugh..i didnt like the graphics too much on AW. speaking of which, imagine if the obsidian steed, speakeasy, insanity and silver bullet were in bo3. Omg!! ...Bo3 is down, I'm gonna kill some people with my steed. </TEXT>

Headglitched my ass right behind that rock racking up the headshots. Now it doesnt get voted as much, my only 2 maps were stronghold and infected....or is it infection?  I dont even remember.

<TEXT> Omg. Finally someone i can relate with. Dude, i hate burst weapons too. After 2 months of playing bo3, ive finally decided to go for dark matter. I started with assult rifles first because i spent most of 2 months using them. I was down to the m8a7,shieva and xr2. Holy hell, the grind for headshots and blood thirstys was crazy. I didnt have a hard time for long shots because i had on the x3 scope and camped in the back on the maps on hardcore mode. After 1 month, i finally got my last bloodthirsty for the shieva today and unlocked diamond today. Then i thought to myself and said screw it. Im not going for anything else. I'll keep diamond on assults only. If u need tips inbox me.

<TITLE> The 3 year development cycle </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-21 07:54:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, so I was watching someones Vid the other day and they were talking about black ops 3 was the first true current gen cod with a 3 year development cycle. Then a thought occured to me, while its good in general for a studio to have 36 months to perfect a CoD game, its amazes me that since cod Ghost, cod has literally been shit. Black ops is decent but lets be honest, the beta version was 100% better than the released version. I'll explain why in a moment. People are arguing that black ops 3 is the best cod to date. Its ridiculous that they fail to see that the game is so broken, treyarch has given bo3 so many patches within 3 months that i lost count. With a studio having 3 years to make a Cod, its seem to me that they are forgetting their roots and start putting in shit we don't need or want, they're doing so many unnecessary implementations its taking out the core of what Cod is. If you ask me, the 1 yr cycle cods were the best. In so little time, they've managed to give us alot of shit and cod was at its best (in my opinion). Agreed that they were not in anyway perfect but they were tons of fun. They had their Op guns, tons of maps and hella awesome killstreaks. Which is why it blew up on youtube. Now, I could've delt with bo3 in its beta phase where the hell storm, black hat, m8 was OP AS BLOODCLAAT. It would've been 100% better than its current state. Everyone is praising treyarch, lol. They gave me a game that shipped with basically 4 maps and i only end up playing on 2 ....95% of the time for 13 weeks. What a joke. Bo3 has nothing on mw3 or dare i say even ghost. Now i hear everyone is begging for waw2 or mw4. You know what the real problem is, people don't know what they want, but they like to open their mouths. When these studios first started making these cods as well as olderrrrr video games. You got what you got. You play it, if it was glitched, it was glitched...its what made some games fun. It started becomming a problem when studios started listening to these young twats over twitter, fb and other social media about " how to make cod better " instead of just doing their jobs. That is what started the downfall of cod. Anyways, i hope no one got butthurt about what i just said. IW, treyarch and sledgehammer...are you listening?...boots on the ground, 15-16 maps, tons of guns atleast 1 or 2 OP in each category and some badass streaks that if the enemy calls them out, it would make me wanna turn off my system and go curl up on my mother's lap and cry. Thank you and have a nice day all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever since i started playing COD back when mw2 was the bomb, ive only played core. I use to think HC was only for sweats and try hards. Once in a while i would try it out , but i hated it because i always died, i had no uav 80% of the time , no clue how much bullets i had left or if i even had streaks unless i saw it appear on my screen ( text ). I stayed away from HC until recently (bo3) when my friends wanted to party up and play HC, i would away rage quit dying for no reason, 1 shot kill with no time to react,  teammates accidentally killing me, random nades. It was a shit show. About 3 weeks ago, i just hopped into a HC KC lobby to finally get the hang of it so that i can play with my friends. After 2 weeks of playing nothing but HC, i fell in love with it because it teaches you alot. I.e....it teaches you to read spawns. Now, i dont need a uav to know where the enemy is. I dont need to get a shit ton of hit markers to drop 1 guy, 1 shot and move on to the next victim. Its fast paced and tons of fun. HC keeps you on your toes and teaches you to be a better COD player in general. Going back to core would be a noob move for me. guys, play HC for a week or 2, you wont ever wanna go back to core. I had no clue what i was missing out on. Your your bestfriend in HC is the black cell. You dont need a silencer, ghost, fmj, high caliber. Save your slots. I use the HVK with quickdraw, grip and rapidfire. Anteup, engineer and fast hands with seraph combat focus. Hcxd, uav and care package. All i play is HC KC. 3 kills and collect tags, you got your streaks. Using combat focus while picking up tags, omg, i overlap my streaks everytime. What i like about this loadout is that when u get your care package, you can reroll something shitty and always get high streaks. I always get a wraith, raps, lightening strike, cerburus, g.i unit or sentry gun which is why i would always go 30-40 each match. Try HC. Trust me. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-01-05 18:15:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This idea is in conjunction with chaos moshpit , But chaos moshpit is one mode per match. What if combo m
ode added all the modes in one match at 2 mins each? For example, it starts out TDM, then changes to kill confirmed , then changes to hardpoint, then changes to safeguard followed by demolition, followed by uplink , then CTF and lastly , B flag. These game modes gives both teams a chance to win. They will rank up faster ( for playing majority of modes ). They dont have to be in my specific order. I didnt include S D for obvious reasons. Its something different and i hope one day in the new cods to come that they will add this mode in. Do you guys like the idea? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Beta Version vs. Released Version ....My 2 cents. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-09 10:58:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In my honest opinion, when I played the beta version, I had more fun than playing the released version. I'm not arguing that the version we have now isn't great, I'm saying the beta version was greater. They nerfed hellstorm and made it harder to get. I was getting trips and quads with that monster in the beta. At that time I was thinking, Wow they finally made the hellstorm more viable than bo2's version, then people that got killed by it, told treyarch it needed a nerf, not to mention up'd the score required to obtain it. Now, at most I get 2 kills from it  (if I'm lucky). Secondly, People that died by rejack, cried to treyarch and THAT got nerfed, now nomad is rendered useless, ( hive is still great, but people don't seem to wanna touch nomad). I used rejacked and still end up dying, No biggie, BECAUSE it can be countered by shooting the fucking smoke, but now that's gone. I mean, I remember Vahn said it wasn't suppose to keep your streaks anyways, So I guess it is what it is. Sparrow   gravity spikes are OP as fuck, I die from them all the time, but I don't care. why hasn't people cried about those? I use sparrow AND grav spikes all the time depending on game modes. I also, dislike the fact that they removed the holographic screen when to go to call in a strike. What I'm trying to say is, The only thing they should've fixed in the beta is the LAG/Connection issues (obviously) And minor Buffs to certain specialists Like the kinetic Armour (I know Active camo got a buff too). As far as the guns are concerned, They all seemed great, Nothing needed to be nerfed, not even the M8A7. You could've chosen ANY gun in the beta and do excellent.  Did you guy's had more fun in the beta or a better time with the current version? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seeing a lot of posts about this. People are reporting, including myself that we are loosing gunfights that we SHOULD'VE won. People are blaming their internet, some are blaming lag, i'm blaming broken camera angles. This isn't news. Broken camera angles has been there since bo2. Bdobbins spoke about this, they're videos about it on youtube and even thunder spoke about in his bo2 vids as well as his LATEST VID. You see the guy first, You shoot, You get instamelted and you're left scratching your head, thinking WTF just happened? when you look at the killcam, it shows the guy saw you first and your gun wasn't even up yet, right? Treyarch needs to address this issue. it's forcing people to play campy in a corner aiming down sight at a door. I read a post earlier of a guy posting about it and is ready to delete the game. It's not about getting better at the game that some people suggest, its the game itself that needs to be better. This problem has been around for a long time now and treyarch KNOWS about it. Have you guys encountered this? What do you guys do to counter this? Do you guys get pissed off when this happens to you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry if the title seemed a bit clickbaitish, I couldn't think of a better one. Anyway, Before the bo3 beta, i posted some camo suggestions, it was alittle more than 2 months ago, which can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops3/comments/3gud2s/camo_suggestions/  ...Look at #5 in particular about the " kill counter " part. Now, I MAY be wrong because I haven't checked it yet...BUT, if you go check out the 2nd PRESTIGE for your weapon...it shows " Kill counter ". Hmm, Maybe i'm way ahead of my self. I'm not positive if its for matches only or just in overall in general ( which i assume ), But i'm glad they implemented this. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-10-09 06:28:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, so since rejack doesn't longer keep you on your streak, what is the point of it still being in the game at all? I just read the the charlie intel " patch notes " from treyarch and they mentioned von said it wasnt even suppose to keep you on your streak. Okay, you run rejack, player kills you, they get rewarded with the kill, you rejack...loose your streak, rise up...player kills u again...gets rewarded again? I'm sorry, but i'm a bit confused as to what rejack was even suppose to do in the first place. It sounded like treyarch wanted to bring back the tac insert under a new name, because that's BASICALLY what rejack is now. I thought they would've decreased your scorestreak by half of what you had, which wouldve made more sense and rejack would still remain as viable. No one will use rejack now. Its now a useless ability. However, i could only think of one reason why i might run rejack,  nuclear medal. Getting that medal/playercard once and never using it again. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, Before people start down voting, here me out. I like zombies as much as the next guy. it's definitely a good alternative from multiplayer. But, as awesome as zombies is, on the next treyarch release, would you guys want another zombie mode or something new and fresh? I feel like after a while, zombies......(don't kill me) ...MIGHT...get boring? Zombies has been in WAW, BO1, bo2, and now bo3. Not sure if there will be a BO4 in cod2018, BUT lets stay they start a new series, wouldn't you wanna see something new besides zombies, i mean...keep zombies..its a fan favorite, but something else new to the table...who says it only has to be 4 MP maps each dlc? who says it has to be MP, CAMPAIGN, zombies/choas/surivival only? (i know aw had exo co-op as well). I feel like treyarch knows tons of people like zombies and will milk this to the very end. (i'm sure they will). You might want to ask me, well do i have any ideas for another mode besides zombies? I think I do. Why not have an open world mode? Where plays can meet and do various activities, mini missions,carnival games and unlock achievements/trophy's...i would love to use SPARROW and shoot some targets (archery)...and it'll take place in whatever country or city the CAMPAIGN is based in. bo3 example/ we can choose a specialist character and use our specialist abilities in the open world and fuck with people, i guess you might say kind of like GTA...but a mini version thats based in whatever city or country the story mode is based in. I strongly believe that the current gen consoles will be able to handle it. it's just an idea and i think we need to use the current gen consoles to it's full potential. introducing something FRESH to future cods. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The fastest way to reach prestige master in black ops 3. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-26 19:31:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking about it and i thought to myself, how can i reach master prestige super fast? Well, this is how. Play moshpit. Moshpit has a combination of different game modes that earns for basicially everything. For example, itl put me in a killconfirmed match, which..without knowing ill probably earn xp for challenges , guns, camo. Same thing when it throws me in a domination match the next game, ill earn all those challenges for dom, hardpoint, uplink, tdm....without even realizing it. Now, before i enter mostpit, ill go in with overkill, 2 primaries, completely naked. No  perks or attachments. From what i know, you earn camos by playing without perks or attachments and using 2 primary at the same time makes these camo challenges quicker, plus u earn xp for those challenges as well.  I think that might be the fastest way to reach prestige master. Also, make use of these methods during double xp whenever available. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Stackable Killstreaks </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-25 05:47:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone. I know when myself, as well as other's are laying the smackdown on the emeny team, they earn their killstreaks. Sometimes, as they're in the momentum, they don't get a chance to use their streaks , the game overides killstreaks as you earn them. Now, i can see how this is fair, because if a guy can manage to earn his streaks ONCE, for example, reaper - ac130 - osprey gunner.....he can just sit in an isolated area the entire match as his streaks gets him his streaks again because of stacking. HOWEVER, to counter this, why not add a PERK to stack streaks, but throw it in a tier with ghosts or where it would seem impossible to get without "needing" certain other perks to obtain, if you catch my drift. Or consider adding stackable streaks as a specialist ability on future DLC specialist characters, in the same way combat focus ability adds extra points when you get kills/use streaks to earn extra points with kills. Only reason i thought about this is because, I usually backpack my teammates but sometimes its never enough, because as good as i am , time limit runs out and i loose a match because i needed like 3 more kills to get the WIN. If my first or second streaks were stacked, i couldve easily whip out my "wraith" and laid the smackdown for the W. You know how it is, when you're backpacking your team and you're waiting for your next set of streaks to get that few extra kills to carry your team but impossible because either time runs out, enemy gets there first ....if only your streaks stacked. Its just a thought guys. What do you think? </TEXT>

I feel like if they ever make BB3, jason statham will be in it. that dude is in all the good action movies. will, martin, jason statham, chow yun-fat, jet li would make an awesome BB3. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-08-25 22:16:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> i've been thinking since we already have the beta downloaded, we can still access the paintjob option...wouldnt it be nice if we can still use paintjob and customize our guns and have it save offline, so when the game is released, itl be patched in and we'll be able to use them in game? I've spent more time on paintjob than i did playing the beta. In addition to this, when the game is released in November, will you guys be using paintjob MORE, or worrying about prestiging faster? Keep in mind that von said that theyre not fans of adding more prestiges. which means we have 1 year to reach prestige 10. but he also said that, theres something new coming to the prestige options, meaning theres a new way to leveling up more even after reaching master prestige. i'm guessing that has to do with Leveling up the specialist characters. but all that aside, I personally will hit the paintjob first and try to make something for all my guns before even touching multiplayer because, ive spent significant time on mutiplayer already and i know dilly YO...on which classes and specialists are OP, plus i know the spawns and the 4 maps that ive played on. the only new thing is, more maps but ive got 12 months for that. so yeah, i'll be spending more time in paintjob than playing mutilplayer on release. what are you guys gonna spend time doing on launch? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-08-13 14:35:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> if you had the option to choose camos, what would they be called and looked like?

mine are:

1. sapphire - similar to the diamond camo but with sapphire gemstones.

2. Matrix - animated matrix camo. i shouldn't have to explain this one, you all know what i mean here. 

3. Fireworks - Animated ( self explanatory ).

4. Night sky - Animated ...that displays how the stars look at night, that includes quasars, galaxies, shooting stars....ect. 

5. skull   Bones - Skull   bones design that looks really nice, but the best part of this camo would include your " kill " count , so that you wouldnt have to constantly pull up the scoreboard to check your kills. starts from the beginning of the match til the end. hence why its called skull   bones. ( death ).

6. Weaponized115 ( i know its coming back ) - but not just in green, but in like blue, red, hot pink, gold, purple...you get the idea.


what did you guys think of my camo ideas? submit your own. thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a thought, i've always wondered why players from xbox and psn never meet up in the same game lobbies. Please don't bash me for asking this, As i don't know how any of this system works. From what i initially figured, [EXAMPLE] ..I thought xbox and ps worked as an ISP. LETS SAY , xbox is timewarner and PS is verizon...(isp)...they're both going to connect to the internet eventually. just different way of connection. but there is only one game/server that it connects to. so lets say bo3 or any cod for that matter...why arent both consoles meeting up in lobbies " treyarchs/activision/bo3 servers?" or im guessing itl be a system overload and activision has their own seperate game servers for xbox / psn users ALONE to handle the capacity of players? do you guys understand what im trying to ask? can someone with more knowledge of this please elaborate on this more.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When i use to watch chrissmoove back in the days, in one of his commentary, he had an idea for a map. he called it " Flawless ". when the game starts, (TDM/KC) , your team and the enemy team are facing each other, as soon as the timer counts down, START SPRAYING YOUR GUN LIKE A MOFO! trying not to die. Just to see who would go flawless. That sounds like a great idea for a map, because when the map comes up in rotation, you get nervous and anxious to be the one running to hide as quick as possible to avoid being killed to end up going flawless. of course, IF you die in the starting point, you wont respawn right there, you would respawn in the back/side of the map where most of your teammates are at just as regular modes. what do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TITLE> JUST IMAGINE! [A NEW BREED OF COD] @TREYARCH @SHGAMES @InfinityWard </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-06 14:15:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, I know this topic/suggestion has been talked about or mentioned already, but it didn't go anywhere.

What if all 3 studios (IW,TREYARCH   SH GAMES) worked on 1 cod, and have it be released every 3 years, instead of every year?

When a cod is released, its usually unfinished and it always hyped up to make sales quota and then 6 months into the life cycle of the game, its quickly forgotten by the " community " because the " new " COD info is being released/leaked and then, people get on THAT hype train. when the news of the new cod is released , the " community " starts to focus more on the new cods info. Then, when that game is released, its the same thing over and over. " they should've brought this back, this shouldve left this out, we wanted that gun/scorestreak/perk to return. a whole bunch of shit. but , what if....

what if all 3 studios worked on 1 cod. and they all work specifically on their strong points to make 1 exceptionally great cod that WOULD/WILL last for 3 years.

- IW is known for their excellent hit detection and sound mechanics, as well as killstreaks/maps/guns.

-treyarch is known for ZOMBIES, color details, maps, perks/guns.

- sh games is known for CO-OP, game modes, supplydrops, customizations, UI.

* movement mechanics should stay classic.

if all 3 studios worked on 1 cod, but specifically within their strong suites only, we wouldn't be complaining all the time. also, the game will constantly get patched/bug fixes and best of all, hackers wouldn't be all over that shit after 6 months. i say, season pass should be around $110 which should include 1 gun from previous cod, 1 re-mastered map, ( remains same, not re-visioned ), 5 new maps, 1 zombie map (total 6 maps) ( each studio get to design 2 maps). 

i think this idea will keep cod on the charts. i think people will get back into cod more. some people like treyarch more, and wouldnt purchase a iw or sh cod, and vice versa. if all 3studios worked on 1 game. people wouldnt hesitate to make a preorder.

what do you guys think?

<TITLE> Mutiplayer Maps [suggestion for bo3] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-03 14:05:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One thing i hated about all cod was being forced to play on maps i didnt like. I wish they would implement something like " map filters " giving us an option to choose which maps we want to show up. If they had this in Bo2. I wouldve definitely deselected DRONE AND OVERFLOW. i understand an option like this might have an impact on lobby match making as it would probably take longer depending if SBMM is as it is in Aw. HOWEVER, i don't think it might be an issue considering everyone knows all the bad/ugly maps and wouldn't vote for them anyway. SO, lobbies with all the great maps would show up all the time and wouldn't take long to find. do you guys think this is good idea? i know some of you will say " it will get boring after a while playing the same maps over and over ". no, if the game ships with about 12-13-14 maps, only about 2 maps at most PROBABLY wont be good. that leaves about 10 maps that will come up in rotation. i loved playing mw3, it was where i first started, if i had map filters, i'd play on dome, hardhat, mission, baakara, arkaden, seatown, village AND resistance, all day everyday. </TEXT>
