<TEXT> They opened for Car Seat Headrest in Nashville and their stage presence is unbelievable. It was pretty crazy seeing them bringing back 70's stage antics compared to the great but subdued stage presence of CSHR. </TEXT>

But the worst was when I was going to work downtown at like 8 a.m. on a Sunday and saw a guy going the wrong way on the 8th Ave roundabout, right near the precinct.  He was not stopped.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah and I would also look at the damage with the photos that were taken at the scene with your relative's camera.  But this is super important and if they have been involved in a lot of car accidents you can always use that as proof to nullify or at least negate charges.  Also, if these people are as dumb as you think they are, you can find their Facebook and see if the witness and the driver of the other car are friends with each other on there.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was nice the few times I met him. He seemed to have a good sense of humor and was pretty laid back but I could understand why people could get that negative vibe from him. I pretty sure he's just really sarcastic and it comes off as douchey.
