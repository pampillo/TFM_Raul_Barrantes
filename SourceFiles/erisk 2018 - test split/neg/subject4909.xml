<TEXT> Thank you for the input/advice. I know that owning a business is hard. The lady from Shark Tank (Lori Greiner) said - "Entrepreneurs.  The only people who work 80 hour weeks to avoid working 40 hour weeks."
I am willing to work hard/HARD

What is your business? Why did you start your business? Is it online? I'm really interested to hear your perspective on owning your own business/being an entrepreneur. </TEXT>

<TEXT> UPDATE 3: Updates   Mini VENT: Moved Out, Mental Health Triggers, Jobs/Money, ETC.

This is an update from my other posts. Titles of Previous Posts Below:
Original: 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition   depressed VENT. 

Update 1 UPDATE: 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition   depressed VENT. 

Update 2 Vent Post: Process of Looking for Apartments/Moving Out, Fear, Doubts, Setbacks, "Good Faith Deposits," Intuition vs. Paranoia 

Quick Updates 
- I moved out a month ago   I'm under a 6 month lease. 
- Unemployed/Jobless but taking it easy/trying to work on myself. - Started a business a little under a month ago but no sales.

Mini VENT 
After a terrible year living in Squatters conditions. I moved out and have my place with some roommates (not friends). My life has improved   I am grateful. That aside I am still not all there yet. I am realizing that I suffered from a traumatic personal experience. Some of my reactions: 
- I am afraid to go out (though I do leave the house occasionally at least 1 or 2 times a week). Get anxiety/overthink. 
- I am funny around bathrooms, toilet humor, looking at toilets, and hearing about others bowel movements. I am also sometimes disgusted   ashamed of myself when I have to use the bathroom. * that was hard to write.*
 - Realized that I have a hard time living in the present/enjoying the present. For all that year before I moved out. I had to detach myself to cope; so it's hard for me to break that habit. Naturally when I am upset, I detach, brood, and retreat. But for that year I detached even more for my survival not only just because I was upset/natural for me. - hard for me to control my thinking. Someone says something to me   my mind races and I think of bad things.
For all these reasons I am still not ready to commit to a job. Which I hate. I ashamed not to have a job or be working because I know I am judged about that and seen as lazy/etc. I don't want to enable my fears but at the same time I don't want to ignore them either. If I get a job before I am emotionally ready. I am afraid I will get fired because I won't be giving it my all   and frankly I am simply not all there yet.
At this point I really want to work from home; but I don't think I have the expertise to do that. Anyone have any suggestions on how I can find a part time work from home job? I live in a big city, so finding a job won't be too hard. I am also college educated.
Lastly I started an at home/product based business almost a month ago. I don't have any sales but this is something that I always wanted to do (owning a business/being an entrepreneur). It's a small simple business, nothing massive. It's more like a side hustle than a business (for now ;). I want to be independent, work for myself, and be in charge of my own career. I don't want to join the rat race or be owned by the MAN (whatever that means). BTW I know right now that I need a job and probably need a job for the next 5-15 years. This is more for my future.
Details I have savings, so I am not broke. I can pay for the whole amount of my lease terms and my basic expenses (food, utilities, phone). I am disciplined and good with money. I just want a job because I don't feel comfortable relying on my savings alone. I also want to save even more money, so I want more active revenue coming in.

Lastly I hope this doesn't come across as me being ungrateful or me portraying myself as a victim/troll. I am not. I am struggling but I am also trying to self improve. I'm on here because I need more perspectives and other people's advice. Idk why but doing this really helps. I tried journaling a couple of months back but it was all just this big shame/negative thinking/trigger fest. Conversation/Venting Online to others really helps me :)
Questions How can I cope   deal with my triggers/anxiety? How can I find work from home/freelance jobs in the meantime?

Thank you </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have another vent, been stressing, doing research all night and didn't get any sleep (not that I am tired). 
Quick Background:
- Horrible Soul crushing living situation that brings me pain/fear all the time.
- Unemployed but have savings to last a couple of months if I find a place. Not looking for a job until I find and have a stable place.
- Been looking for sublet Craigslist apartments for months on months, as far back as March/April. It's been so long because I haven't been full-time/all the time. I've also been looking for sublets (between 2-6 months), somewhere I can clear my head, collect myself, get a job, save money, and eventually find more stable/longer term place. Lastly it's taken so long mostly because of fear/anxiety. Just looking at Craigslist housing posts used to cause stomach-aches. It still does but less and I know that I need to get out/have my own space.

My situation:
I found a place on Craigslist a week ago. I spoke to someone and went to see the place on Tuesday. There were 2 other people looking for the place too. BTW that took strength, I was soo afraid. My stomach hurt and I was nervous. Thank God my mom was there in case I had a panic attack. Anyway I like the place and I want it. The leasing manager/who is also an individual broker said if I want to continue forward with the process I have to do an application online. 
She emailed me the instructions and the application link. I filled out the application and submitted the required documents (I did everything online the same night). BUT THERE IS A CATCH. I must send a $500 deposit/closing fee to hold the apartment. In turn she will take it off the market. If I am approved then we will continue the process. I am assuming that means (getting/signing a lease). If I am not approved she will return the deposit back to me. Keep in mind that I haven't been approved, haven't seen or signed a lease, and I haven't met the landlords/homeowners.
Even so, I have am having serious fear, doubts about this "Good Faith Deposit" process. I am afraid as soon as I put in the deposit she is going to run off with my money and I won't have any way of tracking her. 
As I already said I am unemployed but I do have savings and good credit. I have enough savings to last the whole 6 months of the leasing term. Even so, I am not loose or risky with my money. My family has always been struggling with money my entire life and I don't want to make mistakes and do stupid things with my hard earned money. I also have a cautious/plan everything nature.

I did mad research. I looked up her name on the state department, I looked up the landlord/house owners property records. Everything seems legit. I looked up housing policies and it isn't unusual or illegal to do ask people for a holding or "Good Faith Deposit" before getting approved, looking at and signing a lease and meeting the landlords/property owners.
I really don't want to be duped. I can't afford to fall for a scam. I really don't want this to be a scam. $500 is a lot to lose for someone who doesn't have a job, and has hang ups about spending money. I can't even buy things I want without feeling guilty about it.

Right now I am waiting to hear back from the leasing manager. I sent her an email with a bunch of questions (such as asking for an electric copy of the lease and getting this "Good Faith Deposit" thing in writing with signatures) and I may meet up with her to see the place again later on today. 

In the meantime while waiting I am freaking out. I don't want to lose out on this place but I also don't want to be scammed/made a fool of. All this fear makes me question if this is my intuition talking or my paranoia. Part me wants to just pay the deposit and see what happens and the other part is like no bitch (like what if I get stuck in a bad leasing situation).

Like what should I do? How can I assure myself? How can I have faith? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Another Vent/Get Used of IT: Fear? How do you embrace and move on from fear? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-12 02:21:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Another Vent/Get Used of IT: Fear? How do you embrace and move on from fear?

I've been on a roll these past week(s?) (emotionally). I've been watching The School of Greatness YouTube Motivational channel videos/ Lisa Nichols videos. I've been practicing positive thinking and I have 7 days down of my daily gratitude journal. The positive thinking is working a bit, but I definitely have a long way to go.

I've also been looking for sublets to rent until I can put myself together and find a full time job/apartment (my first). Even so, there is still this paralyzing fear/anxiety that makes me back out at last minute whenever I get contacted about renting a sublet apartment. When this fear/anxiety overcomes me I get so SCARED (pseudo stomachaches, trembling, and wanting to burst into tears). Like I don't know what to make of it.I have been feeling this way for five or six months. Like this fear isn't motivating fear and I don't know how I can turn it into motivating fear.
Like a part of me still doesn't want to go through with it. A part of me is still attached to this place/this situation. I've had motivating fear several times before in my life. By motivating fear I mean that fear that makes you feel afraid but there is a bit of excitement/drive because you WANT/HAVE/NEED to do. This fear is something else.

Part of the reason for this fear is if I do get out of my living situation, I have no one to depend on if I fall/fail. I don't like that feeling. I know I should just count on myself, but I am not there yet. 6 years of depression make you believe the lies you've told yourself. Hence why I'm practicing positive thinking/doing gratitude journals btw the next step is affirmations and visualization. Not there yet, but I will be. Basically I don't have support or a cheerleader, someone on my corner. Most of my life I've been independent and responsible but also cold and untrusting, I don't want to go back to the cold/untrusting parts. I know I have it in me
to be the person I need to be. But how do I get there? I also know I am giving too much power to this fear. But this fear means something, this fear is important for some higher power/spiritual, necessary reason.

I can't nor want to repress or ignore this fear (I don't think these are solutions). I want to turn it into something I can use. Something productive/motivating (like turning it into something good). Like can anyone relate? How do you embrace and move on from fear? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are the steps to transforming emotional pain/emotions into music/writing?

I want to commit to transforming emotional pain/emotions into music/writing. I've been venting on here a lot and I want to be more productive and shift away from the helplessness/victimhood I am feeling. One step is through music/writing. I was always interested in music and writing and as I got older I stopped/ my focus shifted away from that. Now I want to get back to it. To be honest I was never really committed because of fear and insecurity but now that I want to take control of my life I want to do things that I'm interested in/love. 

Anyway for the people that use their own creativity to healthily vent their emotions, how do you do it? What are the steps to transforming emotional pain/emotions into music/writing? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-10-05 07:05:56 </DATE>

<TEXT> How do I accept that I have changed?

I have had depression for 6 years now and I keep going back to my past. I romanticize my past self and my past. Example of my inner dialog:

In the past I was strong, confident, I believed in myself, I had faith, I was always someone who took responsibility, never felt sorry for myself, and never played the blame game blah blah blah.

I am stuck in my past, but I am also stuck in the fact that I have changed. I am not the same person as I was 6 years, and I won't ever be the same person as I was 6 years ago. I can't go back.

Reasons why I go back is because I can't accept that I've changed, because I don't like these changes, and because I don't recognize myself anymore. I keep going back because there must be something in my past, with my past self that has sustained me, kept me going, and chose not to be depressed. I am trying to get back to me and help myself (whatever that means). But it's not working. What can I do?

By the way this isn't me accepting with my depressed self, but moving past my depressed self. aka deciding to be better. How can I integrate the new me with the old me without accepting my depressed self?  I don't even know if I am making sense. But again, How do I accept that I have changed? </TEXT>

<TITLE> THIS IS AN UPDATE ON 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition   depressed VENT. </TITLE>

<TEXT> THIS IS AN UPDATE ON 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition   depressed VENT.
I need to vent and continue my story from the previous reddit post I posted on August 25th 2016. I can't post the link but the exact title of that reddit post is: 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition   depressed VENT.
This is not a progress report or some happy/miracle story. After the job interviews I felt good and proud of myself for being brave and overcoming my fears. However I reverted back to those feelings of insecurities, fear etc. Basically I am in the same place as I was when I wrote that reddit post. Though I NEED a job; I realize that first I don't want one, and second I am afraid to get one.
I didn't mentioned in my previous reddit post. But a week before that post I had a 7 hour/all day panic attack. I didn't realize this until I spoke to a friend who has had panic attacks before. This panic attack was scary to say the least because it was posing as a stomachache/nausea. I have emetophobia (fear of vomiting);so it was a trigger itself. But I pretty much spent the entire day with a stomachache/gagging. It was a panic attack because eventually I became exhausted, fell asleep, and woke up later on that day without any stomach aches (it was like it wasn't real at all/like the events hours before had never happened).
Pretty much since then I have been taking it easy. I really don't understand why or how it happened. But since then there were a couple of times I felt it coming (the panic attack) but I managed to relax/stop it.
I pretty much don't leave the house and I am not actively looking for a job (not that I want to). I am afraid it is going to happen again in an uncontrolled setting (like inside a train or in an office/if I got a job). That's my biggest fear right now. My body/mind/brain is attacking my physical body and that scares/scared me.
Efforts for me to get to the bottom of it (my panic attack) so far hasn't helped. I tried to journal/write for a while to get my feelings/emotions out but I realize that journaling/writing it all down is like a trigger/was triggering me. Journaling right now is not a good option because 1st it triggers me, second I am depressed and the way I write is from a depressed perspective/lenses and that my depression is shadowing/muddening/altering the truth. Pretty much me journaling is me punishing and abusing myself some more.
Overall I have to take care of myself but I don't know how. I don't have the proper support and I don't know what to do. I have been looking at self-help videos on YouTube. The School of Greatness podcast has been on repeat. Lisa Nichols has been so inspiring. These videos are helpful and it has allowed me shift focus away from the pain, and more towards seeing myself/life in a different, more positive, productive way.
I do know I have to change the way I am thinking (focus on positive thinking and gratitude). Positive thinking/gratitude is the hardest thing for me because my depression has trained my mind to believe all of the lies I have told myself over these past 6 YEARS. Like how do I unlearn, unbelieve the lies I've been telling myself for SIX YEARS. How? How do I regain control of my mind?
I do know that I have to have faith. I referring to faith as a synonym for confidence. I am not talking about faith in terms of religion/spirituality. I have to learn to develop faith (confidence of belief) in uncertainty and in myself. I have done it before during my depression so I know it's possible.
I do know eventually I have to act/ step into action. That is my weak point. I am dreamer, a planner, and an organizer but sadly not a doer. This was a natural trait even before my depression but since my depression it has really took off, took on a life of it's own.
Lastly I know I need to get a goal. Something to carry me through. For the longest time my goal was to go to college. This goal carried me through a fire/homelessness. But I did that a long time ago and that was pretty much my only real goal in life EVER. I feel my life is directionless and I feel lost. My working goal is to be financially and emotionally secure and independent. Even though I want this goal I don't fully believe/support in it yet. Which is strange because I want it.
I am venting/writing on here because it helps. It's strange and ironic but writing in my journal doesn't help but writing online to a bunch of strangers helps. Can someone explain that do me? Maybe it's the instant gratification or maybe it's because I can have conversations with people. Even when I am talking/communicating to my confidant I feel so much better. I guess a huge part of me wants to be understood. Random but talk therapy has helped a lot in my past, I am open to doing it again. I just can't now.
Anyway if you are reading thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sadly I agree. Before my depression I always felt in control of my life and destiny. I was always someone who took responsibility, never felt sorry for myself, and never played the blame game. Then something changed and now I am opposite and trying to regain control of my life. Even so I agree, it's time to join the transitioners.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off don't tell yourself to "man up" That phrase has SHAME WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.  Shame as defined as Brene Brown: "I define shame as the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging  something weve experienced, done, or failed to do makes us unworthy of connection. I dont believe shame is helpful or productive. In fact, I think shame is much more likely to be the source of destructive, hurtful behavior than the solution or cure. I think the fear of disconnection can make us dangerous.- Brene Brown.

Don't let the stigma and shame of having depression destroy you. Telling yourself to man up is you shaming yourself. It is okay/acceptable for you to have these feelings. You are young, you don't have all the answers. So it is okay/normal to feel this way. Feel it, experience it. But don't bask in it.

By the way I am not enabling depression. I have had depression for 6 years and it isn't fun. I don't know at what stage of depression you are on (beginning, middle, etc.) but I would say running from depression, denying that you have it is NOT OK. "Manning up" pushing it down will cause you even more pain.

It is good that you are honest with yourself and honest with the negative effects that your depression has.   Even so, I would say change your perspective and find a way not let it get out of control. Monitor your thoughts, get to the bottom of it (why are you feeling this?) and do your best to transform your negative thoughts into more positive ones. Sit on your depression, don't let it sit on you.

I would encourage you talk to someone that will not shame you, alienate you or make you feel like a freak. Talk therapy is good btw. By the way this is a process, changing your perspective takes time. I am now starting to change my perspective and it's hard work. BUT IT CAN BE DONE. Anyway I love and believe in you man. You can do it. You have what you need. You are not a victim. You are not a drama queen, or a 14 year old girl. You are strong and brave. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Letting go of resentment is easier said than done. I am not sure if I can let go of my resentment. I hold onto to things forever.

To be honest I am not sure if she understands depression. She's been in denial for such a long time, it's gonna take a long time for her to understand it/come to terms with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Title: My best friend got diagnosed with depression, when almost 5 years ago; she dismissed/shamed   didn't believe me when I told her about my depression. Mixed feelings.

Another one of my vents/rants. Anyway as the title explains my best friend told me she got diagnosed with depression. The thing about all of this is I have mixed feelings about this revelation. I say this because about 5 years ago I told her about my depression and pretty much she dismissed/shamed/didn't believe me. I remember this particular conversation from 5 years ago because it hurt me so much and it made me look at her a bit differently since then.

5 years ago

I have un-diagnosed depression for about 6 years. Info: I saw a licensed professional for a couple of years and she told me she thought I had clinical/major depression. She suggested drugs and I declined without being officially tested/diagnosed. It took me over a year and a half to really talk about it. The people in my closest circle knew a bit about it; but I didn't really talked about it. Anyway I guess one day/night I snapped and told my best friend online. I don't remember all the details but I do remember reading her telling me that 
"I don't believe you have depression"
"It's just sadness"

Long story short she pretty much dismissed me, told me that she didn't believe me; and pretty much to get over it. She also gave me the impression that she didn't believe depression was real. After that experience I started to see her differently and shared/confined with her less and less. I also started to trust her less and questioned her loyalty. Whatever the case I chose to forgive her and move on (She is my best friend after-all).

A bit about my   her personality contrasts/relationship dynamic.
Not sure if these apply for me   her anymore****
She is day. I am night. (maybe not so much anymore)
She's definitely quieter, shyer one of us (but not quiet or shy if you what I mean)
She's presented herself as a strong, optimist, look on the bright side, turn the other cheek kind of person.

Present day
The funny thing about all this is when she told me I wasn't surprised. I knew she was hiding things from me. I know she wasn't being honest to me about her true feelings. Her telling me about her depression bought me back to all those years where I felt like a freak to her. This is where my mixed feelings come in. 

Mixed Feelings
The lower part of me is thinking: Ha, I knew it. Isn't it ironic that almost 5 years ago I told you about my depression and you didn't believe me/dismiss me and now look at you. I feel she was being a hypocritical, and a fraud. A part of me wants to rub this in her face. Of course I am not going to do that. But there is a bit of anger and I told you so in my mind.

I am hurt that she didn't trust me enough to confine in me when I gave her plenty of opportunities to do so. I always feel I am more open then she is with me. BTW me being open/vulnerable isn't easy for me at all. I am not an open, trusting person. Whatever the case I felt it was more important to be open/honest than feel trapped/feel fake. She has told me about some of her deepest darkest secrets/experiences (so I know she trusts me). But I feel she didn't trust me enough. I feel she has been fake/in denial for so long that I feel betrayed/lied to. All those times when I tried to talk to her about my feelings she shut me down. She made me feel stupid, ashamed and weak. 

Of course I am going to support her as best I can (I won't turn away from her if she asks for help), but apart of me lost respect for her and has resentment. I am venting on here because I know I can't honestly talk to her about this.

One thing I realized is that she can be really arrogant. She doesn't admit when she is wrong, or acknowledge her part in anything. She's an agree to disagree kind of person. When I told her how hurt I was she shut me down and pretty much left me with the impression that I am wrong, I am starting problems and that's all on me/aka she has nothing to do with it.

To note: I don't hate her or dislike her (if I did I would've cut her off a long time ago). She is a good friend. Anyway this is my vent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TITLE: 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition   depressed VENT. I don't know why I am up this late and I am ashamed to be posting this (and probably will regret this later) but I got to get a few things off my chest. THIS IS HELLA LONG BUT I APPRECIATE ANYONE WHO CAN READ   LEND A PAIR OF EYES/HEARTS. JUST NEED TO VENT. As the title suggests I am 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition   depressed.
By squatters' conditions I mean: Living in a house that had two fires almost 10 years ago/on-going construction. Living without heat, running/drinking water, shower/tub, toilet, stove/gas. Aka can't shower, cook, or shit properly. Living in a living room/sleeping on couches with my parents. This is where we eat, sleep, "lounge"
How I got here/Where I was: Almost a year ago. Got laid off unexpectedly. I was very unprofessional at this job and surprised I didn't get fired (due to depression). Weird but kinda saw this as a blessing in disguise. Mom got fired (again) from part-time job, lost apartment we all had to move back to the house. Mom previously left Dad after first fire. My mom has lost hope. Dad living paycheck to paycheck, constantly working. For months before internship, half-assingly looked for apartments, sublets, full-times jobs, but never really followed through because of depression, fear, and anxiety. Have savings but don't want to touch in case of emergencies. I am very disciplined when it comes to money. I save constantly and can pay for food/phone bill. Fear of being broke; also makes me afraid to spend money. Been battling diagnosed depression for 5+ years. I had a counselor for 2 1/2 years and she told me she things I have major depression.
Where I am/Present day: Let go from internship recently after a long bout of unemployment due to small non-profit budget reasons. Got let go in early August. Mom has part-time job. Before then used to help out/give her $$$ Dad has full-time job. Again half-assingly looking for apartments, sublets, and jobs. Actually have 2 job interviews today but I am not sure I am going (fear, developing slight Agoraphobia). Not sure if I want a job now. Managed to save money from internship (already on top of savings from last job). I can live off these savings for a couple of months. Family is divided. Father stubborn and overworked. Mother hopeless and slightly irresponsible. Etc. Constant fights. Feel alone, that no one has my back, that I can't trust anyone. Resentment, betrayal, anger, sadness/mixed feelings, towards parents/family. My parents has let me down so much. Don't have confidence in myself/ going out on my own because I don't have anyone to truly fall back on if I fail. 1st world poor.
Now that I got the backstory out the way it's time for feelings. This past couple of months have been the worst of my life. I have never felt soo lost and soo weak ever. On days that I didn't have my internship I used be afraid to leave my house. I only survived at my internship because my fear of being completely broke outweighs my fear of being outside. Towards the end of my internship it has gotten way worst (my developing Agoraphobia). I say developing because I can physically go outside it's just that I need to mentally distract myself (playing games on phone, listening to music, reading). I even experienced silent freakouts at my internship. The house has made me a bit crazy. Thoughts racing, constant stomachaches when I think about my "reality"; feeling unhinged/unsafe. The only way I can relax myself is Netflix. I have developed escapist tendencies   I don't think I can face reality head on.
LOGIC/HEAD IS TELLING ME Get a full time job Save some more. Get the fuck out. Don't want to enable my mental illnesses.
HEART/BODY IS TELLING ME: Slow down, take it easy, take care of your mental health FIRST. Be creative, use this free time to write and figure out life/career. Need emotional support. Fear I am heading towards a breakdown
I feel I always have to choose between them. To be honest I am leaning more towards my heart. I am not sure if it's my fear/mental issues talking or if it's actually what I want to do. The only real reason I am leaning towards my heart is, I never actually truly followed my heart. I always did what was expected of me, always was responsible, mature, put together. And for 5 years onward my programming/facade is breaking down. I always did my school work, hardly ever socialized, never got in trouble, always obeyed my parents. I was always smart with money, controlled, and careful. Got to college and all that I was, was questioned. I realized at 18 I was never actually truly happy. I did things because I thought that is what I should be doing than what I want to be doing. Negative thinking, social media, social community isolation (went away for college).
Before I close this novel of a post; I just want to let you know that I am NOT/NEVER WAS SUICIDAL. I also don't think I am completely hopeless. I know I am smart   responsible I just need help/time/emotional support and to not be soo hard on myself. Even so, I don't believe it (I know this is statement contradictory   weird). I struggling with knowing   believing. I know things/have insight, but I can't put them into believing/action.
Anyway vent over (I got much more to say but this is HELLA long). </TEXT>
