<TEXT> Agreed the right cheek is bigger but I could fix that easily by moving the line a little to the left. I can do hands easy, look at my previous posts (specifically the hand one lol). I just decided not to render them fully since they weren't the focal point. I look really young in real life, but the head may be just a little too big. I could send you the reference picture to compare.  </TEXT>

Hilary answered the people's questions while giving clear insight into her plans. She also was more personal and spoke directly to the individuals. How does he win when all he did was attack his political opponent repeatedly instead of offer legitimate plans and responses? And his response to the pussy video was god awful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rendering is fantastic and the colors are very realistic. Some friendly advice I would give would to have more shading and colors in the white part of the eyes to give it more depth. Other than that fantastic job and i look forward to see more facial feature until u can create a whole face as detailed as this eye. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate the criticism, the darker eye should be moved a little away from the nose so the spacing is correct. An easy fix. As for the mouth it because of the way the shadows are working that give her that make her mouth look extended, which can be adjusted with shading. The top of her head is in the shadows and it's not being hit by the light source, so it makes it appear like I cut her head short lol. The lighting is pretty unusual tbh, and not many people see the character like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandparents went to Mexico to see family this week. Apparently they are in Manzinillo, which is unfortunately right in the path of the hurricane. All my aunts and uncles are freaking out in a group text over what's going to happen to them. The people there are stuck since the government has shut down the roads leading out of the area. My aunt got a hold of them and they are getting all the residents with weak homes and sheltering them. I hope they can endure whatever this monster of a storm produces.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well if you catch a golden stag or a Hercules beetle you can get 230,400 bells in one trip if you have the wealthy ordinance on as well. And it takes only about 5-10 minutes to get that much depending how fast you get past the walls. 

I see this glitch as a way to get some quick cash in order to have some money to invest in things like turnips or other huge money making activities.  Also you can do this offline and by yourself if you don't have a wireless connection.

 I don't really know if this could mess up your save but it hasn't done anything so far to me, but i can understand if people are scared of losing everything for quick bells. </TEXT>
