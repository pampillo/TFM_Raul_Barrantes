<TEXT> Hello,
I'm a freelance column writer and screenwriter. I just got a break with a production company. They're asking me for a feature length script. Since most of my screenwriting experience has been with comedy shorts, and commercials. I don't really know what to ask for in terms of pay. This is my first feature length (with someone's story and guidelines), I don't want to high-ball them but I also don't want to be taken advantage of. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I graduated a year ago with a degree in film production, since graduation I worked at a small production company in south Florida. I just quit to pursue screenwriting full time. I want to eventually move to LA. How hard is it to get a writer assistant job? How hard it it to become a script doctor? In the stage i'm in right now, Do I have to move to LA first or can I do the same amount remotely? Thank you for taking the time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm working a production job right now and I hate it. I actually just gave them a months notice. I started this job with the intention of getting experience before I move to LA. I got the experience I want/need and now I plan my next step. I would like to focus on my writing for a good 6 months and treat that as my full time job. I get it, it's a weird feeling, quitting a job that pays and so forth. As long as you do what's best for you and stay focused on your goals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently took off my stock slip ons/silencers and am now running straight pipe on a 2009 Thruxton. Before this, I had my air box removal kit installed. So far she has only cut out once when I turned her on and tried to give her gas with a cold engine. Does anyone have any experience with this? Pros and cons to running straight pipe? Pro for sure is that she sounds great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually bought the NRC Fender Eliminator Kit as soon as I bought my Thruxton. It's been about 6 months and they work fine. It makes taking the seat off a little bit more difficult but they look great and they're very bright. Plus if you google discount codes for NRC you can snag a pretty sweet promo code. Right before I bought mine I got like 30 percent of the total order. </TEXT>
