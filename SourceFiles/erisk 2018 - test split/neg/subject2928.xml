<TEXT> daily caller is twisting this, but that's not surprising as this story originated from some unreliable far right bloggers not based in London. This has already been disproven as what the ban was about.

Daily caller and others didn't tell you this bit of the TFL announcement. It doesn't include all pictures of women in swimwear or lingerie. 

TfLs new advertising policy, which does not include all images of people in their underwear or swimming gear, is only expected to affect a handful of the 12,000 adverts a year which run across the network, including at bus shelters and on-street sites. [link](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khan-there-will-be-no-more-body-shaming-adverts-on-the-tube-a3269951.html)

So he didn't ban 'sexy pictures' and as someone living in London I can confirm you can still see posters with good looking women and men not wearing much. If you read up on what was banned you'd find out it was a ban on ads which focus on weight loss products which use shaming language to promote their product or use images (like the one with the skinny bikini model) which might make young people feel ashamed at their body shape. This can still be hotly debated but the claim this was ridding London of pictures of women in swimwear etc is untrue.

<TEXT> From people I know (I'm usually a labour voter), what I mostly hear is 'I don't agree with the Tories all the time but so and so conservative MP is good for my local area'. For others they just say all the anti-labour stuff from the press like 'he's loopy and friends with the IRA' etc. A few might mention issues with immigration like 'I heard this immigrant did x bad thing it's gotten out of hand'. 

From what I can see they are just living that daily mail image of a middle-class family and conservative 'strong and stable/hard working families' brand matches what they aspire to be. We might mock that slogan but it's working. I try to point out how cuts to schools and hospitals etc will make their working family life harder, but it gets ignored or they have a pang of guilt but I know they'll still vote tory anyway. One tried to argue private health system like the US is what we need (and then moaned about how much they pay for pet insurance with no irony). It feels like brexit all over again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to a show once for a hen-do where the group was x amount of dancers who don't fully strip and guys who cannot dance but have other big talents. In this show one dancer twists his ankle and is sent to hospital. I think he must have been the big finale since the rest of the show was dancing/teasing and no full frontal nudity. When the show ended the crowd was angry. Lots of women screaming about wanting to see cock (they paid I think 30 to do so). Never seen crowd turn so angry so quickly. They club also had bouncers on the mens doors to stop women sneaking back there too.  

I think when some of us women enter a space where slut shaming won't be an issue and there's a ton of cheap drinks, it all comes out into crazy (though wouldn't be surprised female strippers have similar issues with stag dos). It's pretty awful behavior but I think its what male and female strippers deal with a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> UKIP doesn't have a seat in parliament, they just lost bunch of council seats to 1, their party leader couldn't get a seat. Yet the Greens with seat/s in previous elections cannot even get close to the same coverage UKIP gets. Sometimes UKIP is treated like one of the big three when they've failed in most general elections. This isn't just a BBC issue though. 

Also to use the BBC site you've also got to go to the individual pages, stories about NHS and Education cuts are squirreled away into the sub sections of the site.  </TEXT>

You're more likely in the US for one of the main parties to shift from centre to far side than people to vote for a different party. Even in the UK the conservatives don't have much competition on the right.

For many Marcon is little too much like centre right than anything left (which is why the fake email saying he works for anti-fa is hilarious because they hate him). So didn't want to choose.

<TEXT> When I first dated my boyfriend we would often walk home late at night. Late one night/morning it was absolutely freezing and there was already frost everywhere. Then coming up behind us there's this guy in a grey suit sprinting in a mad panic. After he ran past us I looked round to see if anyone was chasing him since it was like he was running for his life. Yet there was no one else. It looked odd and creepy, but we didn't think much of it afterwards, maybe there was a family emergency when he was out clubbing etc. Few years later find out some guy in that area had raped and murdered a girl in the house he was staying in after coming home from a night out. He got caught the next day by police when trying to lie about coming home later to find the body. DNA evidence and him being covered in scratches gave him away. The date this happened was also in winter when I started to date my partner and it happened when I lived near that street. I wonder if he was the running man panicking after the murder. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If she says I want the baby but he does not. You'd have to set up a system which might force women to go through a forced abortion. Forcing medical treatment like this against someone's will is difficult and would be horribly unethical. Odds are women knowing this will happen would go on the run or barricade themselves into their homes. 

If women want to end a pregnancy but he does not how would you stop them for sure? Lock them up or follow them around 24/7. If she ends up having a miscarriage would this mean a lengthy investigation to see if she caused it another way. Would people have to go through such psychical and emotional trauma.  

Child support argument is difficult. Would anyone prefer it if the state covered the full childcare costs? As this would be an possible alternative than leaving a child with the risk of poverty. Would this count for someone walking out during early pregnancy or years after raising the child and changing their mind on parenting? What's the risk of someone lying to get out of paying child support (when they were a supporting father for many years) if there's a messy divorce.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Government is focusing more on providing money towards building more private rentals which will benefit investors. So good luck looking to buy these new homes for yourself. 

The government first stated its intention to back the private rental sector in its housing white paper. The growth of managed rental housing provides an alternative to part-time landlords, an industry that has faced considerable regulation due to the problems landlords have been creating for renters and the property market more widely.

In addition, the government has pledged to diversify the tenures available on the UK housing market, arguing there are not enough housing options for those who do not want, or cannot afford, to buy a house outright.

For institutional investors, the private rental sector provides dependable returns over a long period.

<TEXT> The primary requests a voluntary contribution to the school maintenance fund of 45 a year, which can only be used to invest in the improvement of resources. The message to parents added: Camden schools have not escaped the pressure on local authority finances and our funding is likely to face real-terms cuts over the next four years.

Teachers at Rosary Primary School, in Belsize Park, meanwhile, are running a 1-a-week lottery, with the money divided between a weekly winner and the school. Parents have been told that money will help pay for iPads and interactive whiteboards. At Fitzjohns Primary School, in Hampstead, parents are being asked for funds for library furniture that the children will benefit from.

The schools were contacted by the New Journal about their fundraising methods, but we were directed to the councils communications department for further comment. The issues around fundraising are not confined to those who have made appeals to parents, with education leaders either speaking publicly  or privately  about how funding has not risen with the increasing cost of running primary and secondary schools as class numbers and staffing have gone up. </TEXT>

- Was in the meeting where the Kaiser decided to go to war. Arthur was kinda pro-war so his influence was there.

<TEXT> Manning (ne Wagner) has a long, storied history of bashing birth control. In a 2003 radio interview she said, "Of course, contraception doesn't work. Its efficacy is very low," despite the fact that prescription birth control methods are 91 to 99 percent effective with typical use and even higher with perfect use. She believes that emergency contraception (aka the morning-after pill) causes abortions by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus while the medical definition of pregnancy doesn't even begin until implantation. Manning claimed in 2001 that a "a major, if not dominant, mechanism" of the morning-after pill was preventing implantation. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists begs to differ, saying these pills "function primarily, if not exclusively, by inhibiting ovulation, thereby preventing fertilization from occurring.

She previously worked for two anti-abortion groups: as a legislative analyst for the Family Research Council and as a lobbyist for Americans United for Life, the group behind boilerplate legislation that dozens of states have used to enact abortion restrictions. She's also written that there's an "undisputed" link between abortion and breast cancer, which is patently false. The White House would not confirm the appointment to Politico, but Manning's name is already listed in the HHS employee directory and The Hill later confirmed the news. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Millwalls battle against the seizure of its land by the local Labour council has taken an unexpected twist, with a supporters group candidate set to stand in the general election.

The plan to compulsorily purchase land occupied by Millwalls community trust and sell it on to an offshore-owned developer was abandoned in January. An independent inquiry into the affair is being carried out by Lord Dyson, a former Master of the Rolls but the beached scheme continues to cause uncomfortable vibrations, not least as part of a profound sense of distrust between club, supporters and local politicians.

Against this background the Millwall AMS supporters group plans to put up an independent candidate in a Lewisham constituency to highlight the continuing unhappiness at local Labours treatment of the boroughs chief community sporting asset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Manning (ne Wagner) has a long, storied history of bashing birth control. In a 2003 radio interview she said, "Of course, contraception doesn't work. Its efficacy is very low," despite the fact that prescription birth control methods are 91 to 99 percent effective with typical use and even higher with perfect use. She believes that emergency contraception (aka the morning-after pill) causes abortions by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus while the medical definition of pregnancy doesn't even begin until implantation. Manning claimed in 2001 that a "a major, if not dominant, mechanism" of the morning-after pill was preventing implantation. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists begs to differ, saying these pills "function primarily, if not exclusively, by inhibiting ovulation, thereby preventing fertilization from occurring.

She previously worked for two anti-abortion groups: as a legislative analyst for the Family Research Council and as a lobbyist for Americans United for Life, the group behind boilerplate legislation that dozens of states have used to enact abortion restrictions. She's also written that there's an "undisputed" link between abortion and breast cancer, which is patently false. The White House would not confirm the appointment to Politico, but Manning's name is already listed in the HHS employee directory and The Hill later confirmed the news. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Put Yourself Into the Film

When Joss Whedon read the first draft that I had written of Guardians of the Galaxy, he thought it wasnt James Gunn enough. I had actually been holding back. I was afraid that to make a huge commercial movie, I had to make it like other movies. Joss said, I like the parts that are James Gunn. Just make it more James Gunn. And thats what I did. I was glad he gave me that vote of confidence

Think lot of directors and writers have fallen foul of this when they get given bigger movies to do. Not surprised many hold back or get nervous

<TEXT> studios understand the risk and that success if unknown till its released. Even the best directors make the odd bad movie. Studios would like to avoid complete flops (likely why we are seeing more sequels as it will sell tickets) but they know sometimes you can feel like you have a hit and then something goes wrong in production somewhere and its not a hit. 

I went to a talk and one producer pretty much said 'you can't make a bad script good, but you can easily make a good script bad.' It could go wrong due to a big reason or little ones like the costumes don't look right or bad casting. Yet they won't know till audiences have watched it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One time I heard of a case where this happened. It was already evidence but its just the one side missed or hoped the other wouldn't pick up the key part. 

It was part of [this](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-framed/#chapter1) mad case 

The Easters had executed the plot together while a babysitter watched their kids, the prosecutor argued. One had planted the drugs while the other acted as the lookout.

Even if the Easters had swapped phones, the records put Kent Easter at the scene.

Guess where her cellphone is? Duff said. By the victims house. Oops.

This seemed to catch the defense flat-footed. Because he had already finished his closing argument, it was too late for Bienert to try to convince jurors this was junk science. After the jury left the room, he railed against the prosecutor. He said he had been sandbagged.

Duff replied that Easters team had had the phone records for years.

Either the defense had not looked at the records, Duff said, or was hoping that I didnt look at the records.

Judge Thomas Goethals saw no reason Duff couldnt save a good argument for the end.

Dear Mr 

We have been alerted via social media to an open letter from you addressed to Bassett, Chief Executive of the Electoral Commission. Although we have not yet received a copy of the letter, we thought it would be helpful for you to have an early response. I am responding on behalf of Bassett.

Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA), there are controls on who can donate, lend money or give credit to political parties registered in Great Britain. These transactions must be recorded and, if above a certain amount, are reportable to us by political parties on a quarterly basis. We publish these reports on our website. Parties must only accept donations and/or loans from permissible, mainly UK-based sources.

To answer your specific questions:

1. Donors or lenders have no legal responsibility to report transactions to the Commission, therefore HSBC and IPGL did not and were not required to inform the Electoral Commission of these transactions

2. Our online register of donations and loans shows reported donations to the Conservative and Unionist Party from IPGL Limited. When accepting these donations, the Party was responsible for ensuring it was from a permissible source; there is nothing in your letter to suggest it was not.

3.   4. As we have not been presented with evidence that a breach of PPERA has occurred, we will not be taking further action in this matter. 

Please see our Enforcement Policy here for further details, in particular chapter six for details regarding how the Commission handles allegations. The other matters that you have raised regarding governance at IPGL Limited are not matters for the Electoral Commission.

I hope this information is useful. If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact the Commission.

Yours sincerely

Head of Regulation </TEXT>

<TEXT> CNN has refused to run an ad made by President Donald Trumps team due to its labeling of several prominent news anchors as fake news.

The ad was made to celebrate Trumps first 100 days in office, including a list of things he has accomplished since his inauguration. The narrator in the ad then says, You wouldnt know it from watching the news. It then features images of CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow, and others along with the graphic reading fake news.

CNN requested that the advertiser remove the false graphic that the mainstream media is fake news,' CNN said in a statement. The mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false and per policy will be accepted only if that graphic is deleted.

Michael Glassner, the executive director of Donald J. Trump for President Inc. called CNNs refusal to air the ad shamful.

It is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country, Glassner said in a statement. Its clear that CNN is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesnt fit their narrative. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but they do occur, and are often carried out by other British nationals. 

...

There have been a number of very serious accidents (some fatal) as a result of falls from balconies. Many of these incidents have involved British nationals under the influence of drink or drugs. Your travel insurance may not cover you for incidents that take place while youre under the influence of drink or drugs. Some local councils will impose fines to those caught behaving irresponsibly on balconies or practising balconing.

Religion has had an impact on our lives and it can be interesting to study, even if you don't believe it. Also it keeps Religion in one class rather than pressure to teach 'creationism' in science classes you see in the US.

<TEXT> If I can't run or get help and someone is coming at me with a knife. I'd have better chances with a knife of my own (with my slight training) or even a chair than trying to defend myself un-armed (to note I come from a country where guns are not common or legal). If I can get a successful block or grapple I'd have better odds on stabbing them in return and stopping the attack or be able to run away. Or even if I do get stabbed I can slow them down with stab back or keep the amount of stabs down to a minimum. However this is in a 'I cannot run' scenario.

<TEXT> volunteers have been terrible for libraries. Librarians do more than just shush and hand out fines. 

Some of the duties can be they have to organize and update the stock (which they currently has been no money for due to cuts that fuels their death cycle), run projects to modernize the library (like increasing digital content or expanding into new areas), archive important local knowledge and books which are not digital yet, organize repairs and IT systems, set up rooms for community education and clubs, maintain a quiet study and work space etc. 

Why you need a qualification be a librarian and even universities have to funding and pay staff to keep knowledge and services running. It's same in the public but they handle a much wider group to think about than students.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good: still a hilarious movie with great chemistry. Felt like it balenced out humour and the series parts the pacing is good. The fx was great the last one on ego looked like stop motion. I'd say still good follow up to the last film. Great bad guy really felt emotional part of the reveal so well set up.

Badish (but doesn't ruin the movie). Groot almost got annoying i still laughed though. Lots of jump cuts to other scenes which was bit jarring. Almost too much exposition  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its going to be a bloodbath and Labour know it, one Conservative MP said. Were going after people like Liz Kendall, and I think well give her a good run. Lilian Greenwood, Vernon Coaker will be gone as well. Tom Watson is in a bit of trouble as well because hes got a big Ukip vote [which may go Conservative].

Another Midlands Tory MP said: We are going to do very well in the east Midlands and the question is how well. Vernon Coaker is going to have to work very hard to keep that seat, even though hes been there 20 years. In the West Midlands, were going to do even better.

Watsons seat in West Bromwich East is not considered by the party to be at risk and neighbouring Labour MPs who spoke to the Guardian on Wednesday said they had seen no sign yet of a targeted Tory offensive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They were caught hiring FN staff as EU staff and broke rules of what counts as EU assistants. I think this has come out because they refuse to pay back the money but they have been sanctioned for breaking the rules once already. The investigation is about if the sanctions are needed.

Le Pen, specifically, is accused of paying her bodyguard, Thierry Legier, and her chief of staff, Catherine Griset, with EU parliamentary funds. Le Pen is believed to have submitted a "fictional" work contract before the European Parliament presenting Legier as an assistant, while Griset was living near Paris and working on behalf of the FN in France rather than at the European assembly

The European Parliament has already sanctioned Le Pen for allegedly misusing nearly 340,000 euros of EU funds during the 2011-2012 legislature

Since February the far-right nationalist's monthly salary as an MEP has been cut by half to around 3,000 euros and other allowances have been withdrawn. The current investigation aims at establishing whether other sanctions are warranted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Among the most desperate are Palestinians who were already considered refugees in Syria, and so are not eligible to be re-registered by the UN refugee agency when they arrive in Lebanon. They live in overcrowded camps and receive very little aid.

Almost as vulnerable are those who arrived from Syria after May 2015, when the Lebanese government asked the UN to stop registering new refugees.

"Those who are not registered as refugees are struggling," Abu Jaafar says. "What can they do? They are desperate and they have no other means to survive but to sell their organs."

...

"I don't really care if the client dies, I got what I wanted. It's not my problem what happens next as long as the client got paid."
His most recent client was a 17-year-old boy who left Syria after his father and brothers were killed there.

He's been in Lebanon for three years with no work and mounting debt, struggling to support his mother and five sisters.
So, through Abu Jaafar, he agreed to sell his right kidney for $8,000 (6,250).

...

Across the Middle East there's a shortage of organs for transplant, because of cultural and religious objections to organ donation. Most families prefer immediate burial.
But Abu Jaafar claims there are at least seven other brokers like him operating across Lebanon.

"Business is booming," he says. "It's growing and not decreasing. It definitely boomed after the Syrian migration to Lebanon."

<TEXT> To beat the paywall (if you're cheap) google the title 'UK public finance: councils build a credit bubble' and click the link.

Here's an excerpt.

Fuelled by cheap state loans, local authorities are trying to plug the funding gap with property investments

When the local council on the Isle of Wight off Britains south coast prepares to make a 100m punt on the commercial property market, something strange is surely afoot. Yet the decision, taken earlier this year on the genteel island that was home to the ageing Queen Victoria and the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson, is far from unique. In fact the Isle of Wight will be a latecomer to a local government real estate party that has acquired serious momentum.

Across the UK, local councils have been plunging into the commercial property market or embarking on residential property development, either for sale or for the private rental market.

They are punting like drunken sailors all around the country, says a bemused fund manager who has been outbid by local authorities on more than one investment this year.

...

At the end of 2016, according to estate agents Colliers International, local councils were able to access a 45-year loan from this ancient body at a fixed rate of 2.45 per cent.

For some, this is alarmingly redolent of earlier fiascos in the UK, especially the financial crisis. Lord Oakeshott, chairman of Olim Property, investment manager of 650m of commercial property for pension funds, charities and investment trusts, says: English councils punting on property is an accident waiting to happen.

He adds: There are real echoes here of Northern Rock, where many punters were lent all the purchase price of a property, and the Icelandic bank scandals, where councils played a market they didnt understand for short-term income gain.

...

Everywhere the motive is the same: to generate additional revenue to maintain services  housing for the elderly, childrens centres, libraries and the rest  that might otherwise fall victim to the Treasurys remorseless squeeze on local government finance.

Another motivating factor is a change in local government funding rules. From 2020 local authorities will be allowed to keep 100 per cent of their tax revenues from businesses, rather than the 50 per cent they can at the moment. This is intended to compensate them for the shrinkage of grants from central government. It gives them a strong incentive to promote growth in their local economies to expand their business tax base.

....

There is a larger irony in the role of the Treasury: under George Osborne and now Philip Hammond, it has caused local authorities to bear the brunt of its commitment to austerity. Yet via the PWLB it is simultaneously encouraging lowly paid local authority bureaucrats to behave like entrepreneurial risk takers on cheap public money.

The verdict of Olims Lord Oakeshott is telling: As with Northern Rock and Icelandic banks, theres a serious systemic risk to the property market and financial stability developing here, but the Treasury and Bank of England are fast asleep to it yet again.

Oversight: Politicians see risk in property plays

There is one important difference between the current burst of UK local government property speculation and earlier fiascos. This time red flags are already being raised, most notably by the public accounts committee of the House of Commons. It produced a damning report in November that accused the Department for Communities and Local Government, which oversees local government finance, of complacency  especially in relation to the huge increase in property investment.

At a parliamentary hearing departmental officials argued that commercial investments were no more risky than managing social care demand pressures and appeared to have little grasp of the scale of local government activity in property or any understanding of the risk inherent in highly geared deals. Committee members worried that the commercial skills required in the property market were not a good fit with local authority pay scales.
This concern was echoed in March in a speech by Baroness Wheatcroft, a member of the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords. Referring to Portsmouth city councils purchase of shops in Redditch, a Mercedes showroom near Southampton and a warehouse near Gloucestershire as well as a deal on a local ferry terminal, she remarked: I am prepared to believe that local authorities know a lot about social housing, but I am not convinced of their knowledge about Mercedes showrooms or ferry terminals.

Despite these warnings the local authorities rush into property continues, with no hindrance from the government. Local authorities should stick to their own patch and borrow money for local housing and regeneration investments, says Lord Oakeshott, chairman of Olim Property.
Its utterly wrong for them to be punting taxpayers cash at council taxpayers risk on commercial property many miles away, giving estate agents and lawyers a fees bonanza, he adds. Professional investors can see them a mile off and cant believe their luck.

I wrote a letter to which they responded. I got an initial assessment appointment and again have heard nothing since. I still haven't seen a consultant. In all since seeking a referral from my GP it has been 18 months. This is the new Tory Health care. And it is targeted at your children. If you want this for your babies.

Sex worker called the family saying he saw the boy at a notorious brothel where rich and politicians were patrons. Its likley he wasn't the only victim who died and I think there's victims from child care homes say they were taken to that house to be abused. 

I think pizzagate shop is a false one, but there are places like that which have existed. Like Jeffery Epistien only got 11 months for child sex island. Prince Andrew got off for sleeping with one of the girls. Current and former president is linked to him and the victims claim Jeffery collected info from them to blackmail his powerful friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Home Office is trying to discourage EU nationals from applying for permanent residence in the UK to avoid being deluged by applications after the triggering of the Article 50 Brexit clause.

According to new guidance released this month, EU citizens are instead advised to sign up for emailed news alerts that will tell them if and when they need to take action over their UK residence. However, there is no indication the British government is offering any new guarantees over their status post-Brexit.

The updated advice  initially emailed to immigration professionals and now posted on the Home Office website  clearly discourages EU nationals from embarking on the 85-page residence application.

You do not need to do anything as a result of Article 50 being triggered. There will be no change to the rights and status of EU nationals living in the UK while the UK remains in the EU, it reads.

Under EU law you dont need a document to confirm your residence status in the UK. If youre planning to apply for a document just to confirm your status, you can sign up for email alerts instead. Those updates, the guidance adds, will inform interested parties about future steps to confirm their status in the UK post-Brexit.



One immigration lawyer said that while the Home Office had always maintained EU citizens were under no legal obligation to secure residence in Britain before Brexit, the guidance now amounted to officials saying quite forcefully...please, dont apply.

Nick Rollason, partner and head of business immigration at law firm Kingsley Napley, said the message was an attempt by the Home Office to calm people down and allay their fears that they need documentation.

He suggested that officials were trying to delay an expected avalanche of applications until the Brexit negotiations provided greater clarity on the rights of EU nationals in Britain.

I dont think theres any question that the Home Office will eventually put in place a process that allows EU nationals to prove their residence in an easier, quicker way, Mr Rollason said. The idea would be that the Home Office could deal with applications more easily and applicants could send in fewer documents. While the current system has been improved, it still takes up a huge amount of caseworker time.

According to Home Office figures, more than 92,000 permanent residence applications were received from EU nationals in 2016. While the latest data have not been published, the total number is expected to be well over 100,000.

The figure has jumped steeply since last Junes referendum but it still represents only a fraction of the estimated 3m EU citizens currently in the UK. The Home Office announced last month that it was hiring an extra 240 staff in its Liverpool visa office to speed up processing times. But it is limited by budget cuts and does not have the resources to deal with a sustained increase in applications between now and the Brexit deadline of spring 2019.

The Home Office is facing criticism of its permanent residence process on several fronts. Despite some successful moves to streamline the system and reduce the amount of documentary evidence that applicants need to supply, some EU nationals are still being rejected on the basis that they did not take out comprehensive sickness insurance, which is a requirement under freedom of movement rules.

<TEXT> The proposal to temporarily suspend enforcement of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) in the next war would only protect the Ministry of Defence from scrutiny in the courts and damage the UKs international reputation, the two organisations have told the joint committee on human rights (JCHR).

The president of the Law Society, Robert Bourns, said: The proposal to opt out of an international human rights agreement to prevent false legal claims is not only disproportionate, it is dangerous. 

This could stop genuine claims ever being heard and would undermine hard-won international accords that protect our most fundamental shared values. Even claims for negligence brought by our own armed forces against the Ministry of Defence, for instance for providing inadequate equipment, could be blocked.

In no other area of law would it even be considered that all cases be shut down in order to prevent false claims or save money. It is the role of the justice system to determine the merit of each case, a function that is and must remain separate from government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It made some sense we didn't have home appliances, clothing to buy, and food trade back generations and generations ago.

 If you wanted new clothes, or a cooked meal someone had to stay home and make it from scratch and that would take all day with the lack of technology and supermarkets. Given that birth control was not a thing and lot of work was manual and tough, it ended up forcing women to stay behind. Yet if the father died, got injured, or ran off women sometimes were forced also to work in some factories. 

Having two parents go to work makes sense now as the home chores are no longer an all day hard task but more optional for one partner to stay at home. Also you can work and be pregnant in lot of fields as maternity is covered and its less physical or prone to work place injury. The two world wars with men coming home injured or not at all also forced changes for women needing to be a income supplier to families more so than when men were injured at work in the past.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You used to be able to walk right up to the door but over the years they increased security until in the 1980s due to the troubles it became a proper security check point.

Vehicle access was curtailed in 1973 when metal barriers were placed across the entrance to the street.[16] In 1974, the Metropolitan Police proposed erecting a semi-permanent barrier between the pavement and carriageway on the Foreign Office side to keep pedestrians off the main part of the street. The proposal came with assurances that tourists would still be permitted to take photographs at the door of Number 10. The **Prime Minister, Harold Wilson**, rejected the proposal, feeling that it would appear to be an unacceptable restriction of the freedom of the public. Wilson's private secretary wrote "I much regret this further erosion of the Englishman's right to wander at will in Downing Street."[17] </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Council was busy demolishing the slums and rehousing their population in newly built Council Estates such as Angel Town and Stockwell Park. Private owners were either selling their run down property to West Indians at extortionate prices, or to developers that accumulated properties and simply let them crumble away empty, waiting to cash on the promised regeneration of the area. Lambeth Council had in the pipeline ambitious plans for demolition and development, and so repairs were not being made to their existing housing stock.

For those people who fell between the twin stools of home ownership and council housing (ie those who would traditionally have been housed in the private sector), opportunities were shrinking, rents rocketing and security diminishing. This increasing desperation of people at the bottom end of the housing market together with the growing number of empty houses, led to the growth of squatting both in scale and scope.

Not much changes except they've made squatting illegal.

If you like this sort of history in London Freedom Press usually has books on it

<TEXT> [Battle of Orgreave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Orgreave). Think Ken Loach has a good documentary on it. 

Police moved strikers to a field and then charged the horse mounted police at them and beat the shit out of them without any provocation. The police and the pro-government press reported the Miners attacked the police first which is why the police acted so violently. But this was not true, the police attacked first. The current government blocked an inquiry into it

It was the same police force that lied about the Liverpool fans causing Hillsborough disaster and covered up their mistakes.


Following the confrontation, 71 pickets were charged with riot and 24 with violent disorder.[22][23] At the time, riot was punishable by life imprisonment.[24] The trials collapsed when the evidence given by the police was deemed "unreliable".[25][26] Gareth Peirce, who acted as solicitor for some of the men, said that the charge of riot had been used "to make a public example of people, as a device to assist in breaking the strike", while Mansfield called it "the worst example of a mass frame-up in this country this century."[27][28] In June 1991, South Yorkshire Police paid 425,000 in compensation to 39 miners for assault, wrongful arrest, unlawful detention and malicious prosecution.[25][29][30][31] In 2015, the Independent Police Complaints Commission reported that there was "evidence of excessive violence by police officers, a false narrative from police exaggerating violence by miners, perjury by officers giving evidence to prosecute the arrested men, and an apparent coverup of that perjury by senior officers."[ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Johnson is seen making a crude gesture about his victim as he describes how she would wait for a picture with him after Sunderland games at the Stadium of Light, going on to imply that she wore provocative clothing.

Then after the game she was asking for pictures all the time. This went on for about six months and the next thing she says: Can you get us a signed shirt? and uh  then she added me [on social media]. I accepted her, got talking to her, I didnt, I didnt know, I just thought she was 17, 18.

Johnsons claim to prisoners that he thought the girl was 17 or 18 is false. In his first police interview and later in evidence at his trial, Johnson admitted kissing the girl and knowing that she was 15.

football fans waiting outside stadiums for a signed shirt isn't exactly rare and looks like there's the terrible classic 'it her fault for what she was wearing'.

<TEXT> [just copy and paste and cutting down bits from the article. for more detail read the article]

:: CONSERVATIVES

Theresa May has made clear she sees this election dominated by Brexit.

She wants the mandate to take Britain out of the single market and customs union, end free movement and the rule of European judges, as well as replacing a host of other EU laws and regulations with British ones.

But after the Budget debacle in which Chancellor Philip Hammond tried to raise National Insurance despite a manifesto commitment in 2015 not to, and was forced into a U-turn, we expect other commitments from the last election to be dropped.

IN

The biggest priority of Brexit negotiations.

As home secretary for six years she failed to bring immigration down to "tens of thousands". 

Grammar schools. 

OUT

It has been suggested the triple lock on state pensions could go, in favour of a double lock. It's an expensive commitment which Tory MPs have suggested could be ditched. Although Labour will promise to keep it, 

The 0.7% foreign aid target. 

:: LABOUR

Jeremy Corbyn has suggested he will look to fight this campaign on domestic issues - railing against austerity, the crisis in the NHS and low wages.

His party is deeply divided on Brexit, but has announced policies on a host of bread and butter issues in the past couple of weeks.

IN

VAT on private schools fees to provide free school dinners 

A 50p top rate of tax and reversal of inheritance tax cuts - 

Triple lock until 2025 and pensioner perks like free TV licences and bus passes.

Mr Corbyn is also likely to pledge to renationalise the railways.

OUT

Spending cuts. 

It may be a huge issue for unions and regional jobs, but arch-critic Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to make a promise to renew Trident, even though it is party policy.

:: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS

Tim Farron's party are back from the dead and see this election as a great opportunity to make the unashamedly pro-European case for a soft Brexit.

But they will need to keep the Eurosceptics in their South West heartlands on side, with policies for people feeling the pinch on their living standards.

IN

The Lib Dems will be the only major party calling for Britain to stay in the single market, linking it to millions of jobs, and for an open migration policy.

They will promise a second referendum on the final EU deal.

The party have suggested a 1p rise in income tax to provide a 4.6bn boost to the NHS.

OUT

Coalition? The Liberal Democrats have not indicated they will be calling for a deal with the Tories or Labour

:: UKIP

The party are in disarray having lost their only MP, plummeting in the polls and distracted by internal battles, but they hope be make Mrs May feel the heat on immigration.

IN

Dramatic cuts to immigration - as soon as we leave. W

OUT

Nigel Farage

<TEXT> Happened number of times for different twisted reasons. One that sticks out is during the dictatorship in Argentina they executed rebels (like drugging them and dropping them into the ocean from a helicopter). If these rebels had children they took the children from the families and gave them to pro-government parents to raise as their own. If the rebel was pregnant she was kept in jail and was killed after given birth while her baby was taken away to be adopted. Grandparents of these children are still looking for lost children who are in their 20s-30s now and learning that they are adopted and their birth parents were murdered. Think the number is 500 children out of 30,000 disappeared parents and I think they've only reunited 120th people to their original families. 

Edit: [I've been sent much more informed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/66nkym/serious_what_are_some_of_the_creepiest/dgk6l18/) about why it wasn't just people rebelling against government that got tortured. Also, they tortured and killed people in other ways. 

Also lot of native American and Aboriginal cultures have faced issues like their children being taken away by the state and churches which devastating effects.

<TEXT> Playground social politics. 

Tory party esp under Cameron took on the image of being nationalistic, for working people, cosy middle-class social status. People vote for them because that's what they want to be. 

Voting Labour admits to being poor and press media wise they are portrayed as being pessimistic, unpatriotic and awkward nerdy losers. People don't want to be in the 'club' which makes them look like a loser class. Working class pride in Labour has been lost and most people are not in trade unions anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> not husband/father but known people who've gone through this. Talking about it and finding support groups helps show they're not alone and how common it is. Two I know found focusing of raising money for support or related charities helped. As the fitness helped their body recover/positive body feelings and they felt like they were doing something to help others. For them they said it was taking a break from trying 100% all the time and focusing on their health which ended up giving them another pregnancy. As if keeping with the routine before was too stressful so close to the loss. Also talking about the loss like they would if they lost a child, think lot of people feel guilty about doing this and try to become invisible. Close friend opened up a lot after she had a few miscarriages and I think this helped them a lot. Though everyone has their own system of processing grief. For other sending vouchers for food take aways and relaxing products helped them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Too early into Brexit negotiations for people to realize it's the government cuts which are the source of their misery. They're running the election on the brexit high and that people (mostly middle class) haven't felt the pinch yet. But Tories might lose lot of the business or free trade voters if they have money in the EU and are angry. 

Labour one winning strategy might be taking on brexit promises of funding NHS or spending promises for lost EU money. If they can get the numbers right that is. So a 'better in brexit with labour' run. Labour wont win anything back in Scotland. 

Lib Dems might get all the Remain votes as a last ditch attempt to stop it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Elephant and Castle's Heygate Estate was eventually torn down in 2014, many tenants were forcibly evicted from their homes, given compensation at less than 40 percent of the market value. In its place, Londoners were promised a shiny new development that would provide affordable, accessible homes for key workers desperate to get on the property ladder. 

Eventually, Southwark Council decided it would tear the estate down and start again. In 2002, the council  which sold the land for just 50 million, yet spent almost as much on forcing through the development itself  announced that the new site of around 2,530 homes would host 500 social housing units. Yet by the time successful bidder, Lendlease, unveiled its final plans, just 82 were put aside for the people they'd turfed out.

As the remaining home owners clung on until 2013, Southwark Council cut off heating and switched off the lifts, leaving tenants  council tax payers  stranded. Those residents who owned their own properties were served compulsory purchase notices for insultingly low sums. At that time, a local one bed flat could be bought for 300,000, yet Southwark Council offered just 80,000 for Orho Okorodudu's Heygate flat. Another resident, Adrian Glasspool, a teacher, was offered 225,000 for his three-bed ground-floor maisonette. The equivalent on the new estate would set him back 1 million. He said, "Lendlease is estimated to make a 200 million profit from the expropriation of our homes. We have literally been sold out by our own council."

Terry Redpath, a former Southwark housing officer, lived on the estate for nearly 50 years. He told a BBC documentary at the time, "I have been forced to give up my home to accommodate the building of homes for overseas investors."

Four years on, Mr Redpath has been proven right.

....

These family homes were put on the market to UK buyers in November of 2016, with prices starting at 550,000. You can imagine the London-based families queuing up to buy affordable homes and create the kind of memories the original Heygate residents shared for many decades. Only, way ahead of them in the queue  two years ahead, in fact  was the international market.

Sales of these properties began in Singapore on the 11th April 2014, with flash brochures and slick marketing conferences. Not a single unit was for sale in London at this time. Lendlease don't even seek to hide the fact they are selling investment opportunities, not homes, as they list exactly how much rental income  around 25,000 a year for the cheapest  foreign investors can cream off without ever touching the front door.


According to Land Registry searches, many properties have been bought  three at a time  by international investors, exclusively using the same solicitor, Riseam Sharples, who appear to have been given exclusive use for all sales. From their own website, Riseam Sharples help offshore buyers purchase "off-plan properties in the course of construction including multi-unit acquisitions and the sale of contracts prior to completion with many of our clients based offshore".

Not only are all of the buyers of the new South Gardens foreign investors; from the 51 bought so far, many appear to be offshore  untraceable and untaxable. Every single one of the 51 purchases made is listed as "care of 2 Tower Street, WC2H 9NP". Helpfully, that's Riseam Sharples' office address.

Not only does this betray the idea of a "community feel"  an investor surely can't live in multiple properties at once  but also betrays those who were forcibly evicted, many of whom actually owned the bricks and mortar they lived in. </TEXT>

Lavande worked as a housemaid and Marron worked in a shop. Both were exploited and abused. Marron was beaten and almost died, forcing him to run away. After spending months at the Centro de la Alegra Infantil in Coton, where they received physical and psychological care, they are ready to go home

Ms Adams, who has multiple sclerosis, says the assessor did not see her walk.

"How she came to that conclusion, when she's not seen me walk, she's not seen me walk up and down stairs - all she did was tickle my hand with a feather.

"What conclusions she was coming to from tickling my hand with a feather, I'll never know." she said.

In previous assessments the 41-year-old, who originally qualified for a vehicle in 2014, said she had been asked to walk up stairs and physically show how mobile she was. </TEXT>

UK and other countries you cannot claim benefits for 6 months after immigranting. So you need a job to survive and immigration is mostly skilled labour filling in the gaps in our health and factory industry. More so now that the baby boomers are retiring and we haven't the number to cover tax costs of thier pensions/care and fill up work. Also at a time where national youth have degrees as aspire to higher wage work. 

As Islamic immigration goes it isn't new. We've had mosques in our country since 1800s. US since the 1930s

<TEXT> On Monday, ProPublica, the investigative news site, reported that someone had changed the terms of the trust that Trump established before he entered the White House. The trust controls the four hundred or so businesses that Trump owns, and a new clause says that its trusteesTrumps two sons, Eric and Don, Jr., and a family lawyer, Allen Weisselbergshall distribute net income or principal to Donald J. Trump at his request, as the Trustees deem necessary for his maintenance, support or uninsured medical expenses, or as the Trustees otherwise deem appropriate.

That language reads like a license for the President to extract as much money as he wants from his businesses, with no public disclosure, while hes still in the White House. For example, it appears to suggest that the trustees could sell a Trump-owned asset anywhere in the world and forward the proceeds to Trumps bank account without informing anybody. </TEXT>

It likely has same influence as anything rich people do together. They even have a store in london to buy uniforms and freemason socks from known as Central Regalia and some of their lodges have tours. So its not really that secret. 

Though its conspiracy links it to the occult where the church has rivalries with them and the whole they are part of the NWO crazy theories. They have lot of symbolic stuff which people love to investigate for secret meanings or hidden treasure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Women war correspondents are an amazing tough bunch. There are still a lot working today. 

[There was an interview](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/journalists-raped-for-reporting-on-conflicts-we-were-assaulted-to-shut-us-up-but-we-ll-never-stop-9519590.html) with them some years back and some reported on how they had been shot at, kidnapped and raped when reporting but kept on reporting on the wars they were covering. 

Jineth Bedoya Lima was kidnapped by paramilitaries in Colombia in 2000 and tortured and raped for reporting on their activities in the countrys civil war.

She  said: It is a responsibility on my part to tell my story. I never for a single second questioned my resolve to be a journalist. For me it was always very clear the attack was meant to be a way of warning  not only for me but for the whole press. It was a message for us to stop dealing with these subjects.

Ms Bedoya Lima was kidnapped at gunpoint inside a jail after she had secured an interview with a paramilitary leader who was locked up there. After her ordeal, she was dumped naked on a roadside.

Within two weeks she was back at work and did not mention her rape. But after nine years she decided to speak publicly about it. She said: I believe the summit is an answer that we [abused women] have been expecting for so many years.

<TEXT> Sounds like it comes from repeated violence against women he is in relationships with. Guess what could happen is if after 14 days the women he's dating decides to continue and at least knows the risks or that police might take her seriously if the abuse starts (as abuse escalating works to prevent the victim from thinking they will be believed.) 

Godfrey, 30, from Neasden, north-west London, who is serving a three-year prison sentence for two counts of actual bodily harm, perverting the course of justice and witness intimidation, throttled one victim and banged her head on the floor, causing trauma injuries to her head. The attacks took place over several days in October last year.

He continued to intimidate her while on bail and assaulted a second woman he was in a relationship with, Wood Green crown court in north London was told.

The order was made last week after Godfrey admitted the attacks during a court hearing on 14 February. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Murder of Michaela McAreavey </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-04 13:03:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Michaela and John McAreavey were on the second leg of their honey moon after seven day in Dubai. They were staying at a luxury legends island resort in Mauritius on Saturday 8 January 2011.  

On the 10th of January the  27-year-old schoolteacher was with her husband and decided to return to the hotel room to grab a biscuit to enjoy with their tea. Her husband offered to go but she refused and said  'No, no it's okay' and that she could go there herself. 

When she didn't return John McAreavey went up to the room and found her in the bathtub. He recalled in court that her lips were already blue as he tried to revive her. He also noted there was a mark on her neck. He tried for 30mintues to revive his wife. It was later confirmed in the autopsy she was strangled to death, placed into the bath tub and then the water was turned on.  

A postmortem has shown she was strangled  she died from neck compression."- guardian article 

Police noted in the case someone had used an electronic room key to enter the room minutes before she had entered the room. They reported there were no signs of forced entry. 

Police made arrests later which included hotel staff and the husband (who was released). Days later the police had a confession from one of the hotel staff saying he and another staff member had committed the murder. The police put the case down to the hotel staff Sandip Moonea and Avinash Treebhoowoon were caught robbing the room by Mrs McAreavey and in a panic they had strangled her to death. 

Abinash [Treebhoowoon] has admitted to us that he held her legs down and he says that Sandip [Moneea] tried to stop Michaela from screaming by covering her mouth and then strangling her."

However it was in the trial where the case fell apart and the suspects were found not guilty. Below are some details on the trial and police criticisms I can find. 

* Fingerprints found in the room did not match the accused. DNA tests performed in the UK also did not match with the accused. There is a good chance lot of the fingerprints were made after the crime scene was found. This is because the police failed to preserve the scene of the crime. "Assistant Chief Commissioner Yoosoof Soopun, said that a number of people had been in the room in the moments after the honeymooner was first discovered, including other hotel guests, but that "some of them had already left the country" before officers were able to take fingerprints."

Citing samples taken from the murdered bride's feet and fingernails, the forensic expert told the court in Port Louis: "There is no specific indication that any of Raj Theekoy, Sandip Moneea, Avinash Treebhoowoon or Dassen Naraynen have contributed to the results obtained."

* The confession was brought out from torturing the suspect for three days. They trial also became a case about police brutality. 

* The police failed to interview any other guests or people near the scene of the crime. They blame the hotel for not co-operating. 

* The police were criticized for releasing graphic crime scene pictures to a local newspaper.

* The defense tried to make a case that both of the McAreavey's (where the woman in the video looked upset) were at reception near the time of her death but it was argued in court this was actually CCTV footage of a German couple staying at the hotel.

* The police ended up deleting some of the CCTV footage as they were reviewing it. Claimed by only one article I can find online.

* According the Mauritius Telecom Sandeep Moonea (one of the suspects) was on phone to their sister at the time the crime took place. This was used in their defense. 

* The police were criticized for arresting the husband and keeping him in the station for five hours handcuffed. This included him being left in a jeep as they went out for a take away. They even told him not to be so sad as he can 'get himself a new wife'. 

* "a belt which was later found in the room was not analysed by police, the suitcase of the victim was found outside the room, the bathtub was displace before being analysed, several clues and accessed to the room was not protected." Via the wiki where an investigator hints John could be a suspect claiming his story had inconstancies like lack of a phone call records or time mix ups in statements. 

* Soopun told the supreme court in Port Louis: "I just want to state that hotel management, particularly the chief security officer Mr [Mohammad] Imrit, has played a dirty game with the police. Having that information earlier to the police, there's no doubt that poor Mr John McAreavey would not have been taken to Piton police station and treated as a suspect. "It was only on our persistent requests that we obtained the reading and came to know that a magnetic card  JMK supervisor two  has been used at 14.42 hours, some two minutes before the lady, the deceased Mrs McAreavey, had accessed the room. Then it was clear that Mr John McAreavey must be disregarded as a suspect."

* There is an article about an investigation 2012 where they claim to have a suspect but, so far, no names or arrests. The family are appealing for information in the local area. 

Most of information is from Guardian articles covering the trial and the wiki. Also searching parts of the trial not listed in full details.

Edit: adding article related to the case which lists crime rate rise on the island around the time of the murder but might not be too unusual for lot of tourist locations 

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-dark-side-of-a-paradise-island-2185181.html

When I returned in 2006, it was a radically different island. I could drive those 40 miles in less than two hours and any delays were likely to be caused by traffic congestion rather than by poorly made roads (it seems every Mauritian now owns at least one car). There were shopping malls, fast food restaurants and high rise buildings everywhere (in 1994 Mauritius had a law preventing the construction of any building above three storeys). And, within our first six weeks, my girlfriend had been robbed and attacked on the way to her early morning swim in the beautiful Indian Ocean at Flic en Flac, another tourist hot spot....

But in the first 62 days of 2010, seven people were murdered on the island and one burglar was shot and killed in the act of breaking and entering. There were 10 further incidences of violent crime, including one in which some French tourists were robbed by three men armed with a revolver and machetes.

Most of the violence is by Mauritians against fellow Mauritians, but some of it is directed against tourists. Most of the violence is connected with petty crimes, but there was one rape last year.

April 2011 three hotel worker were charged with robbing a five star hotel. 
http://www.thejournal.ie/three-charged-with-robbery-at-another-5-star-hotel-in-mauritius-114322-Apr2011/

The Criminal Investigation Division (CID) of the Chemin Grenier area arrested the three at the unnamed hotel for allegedly stealing money from reception. A plastic bag stashed in a luggage room was later found to contain 40,000 Mauritian rupees (around 1,000) and 855 in euro currency.

News Now Mauritius, reporting the latest case of alleged robbery in one of the islands luxury hotels, notes that it is only a week since employees of another five-star hotel were also accused of robbery. That hotel was Legends Hotel, where Irishwoman Michaela McAreavey met her death on her honeymoon in January.

The equivalent of 500 was taken from two rooms at Legends at the most recent robbery and one man, room attendant Reaz Gurib, has been charged with theft at the District Court of Mapou. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comic book fandom online. 

Most people I know are chill. Yet online it is either a lot of 'whaa why can't they do new things.' Then when they do new things 'aaah you've changed too much!' People just don't buy or like new stories and moan when they try to evolve the characters for once. It's frustrating as someone who likes these developments and we all know it'll be reverted back at some point anyway.

<TEXT> 8 year old Vishal Mehrotra went missing near his home in the 1980s with claims his abduction was linked to elm house a high society brothel where claims say boys were raped and one sex worker says he saw three boys killed there 

 Mr Mehrotras son Vishal was abducted as he walked home to Putney after watching the Prince of Wales and Diana Spencer ride to their wedding in a carriage on July 29 1981.

He had gone ahead of other family members for the last few hundred yards. He was last seen less than a mile from the guesthouse.

Mr Mehrotra claims he received an anonymous call from a male prostitute in the months following. A man he guessed to be in his 20s told him Vishal may have been abducted by highly placed paedophiles operating from the Elm Guest House, Mr Mehrotra said.

In February 1982, part of Vishals skeleton was found in woodland in West Sussex. There was no trace of his legs, pelvis or lower spine, nor of his outer clothes, his sleeveless vest or his Superman underpants.

At the inquest into his death, the West Sussex coroner Mark Calvert Lee recorded an open verdict but said foul play was likely.

<TEXT> Interesting look on how black male masculinity is portrayed and trying to break stereotypes 

The revelation lead Loftin to create HOODED, a photo and video project that deconstructs stereotypes of black teenage boys. In the project's images, Four White Teens and Four Black Teens, Loftin displays against poppy backdrops two screen grabs of google images results, each displaying visually the staggering differences in search results. HOODED focuses primarily on the hoodie, an article of clothing which, when it's associated with the black male body, is tied to white racial fantasies of black males as "thugs" and "super predators," and assumptions that they are dangerous. Many believe that Martin was killed, in part, because the stereotypes associated with his fashion choices made him seem more suspicious. 

Loftin's images provide a competing example of black teenage boys wearing hoodies. In his colorful pictures, black boys wearing bright blue, yellow, pink, and orange hoodies, are seen engaged in playful scenes: hugging, smiling, making funny faces, and posing together in ways that evoke brotherhood and reveal an interiority that isn't often seen in media betrayals. "The video and photographs show black boys who are happy, emotional, and positive rather than the traditional stereotype which paints black males in hoodies as being hardened, intimidating criminals," explains the artist. "It's important that black people, and people of color in general are accurately represented." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pushing boundaries way too early. They can be little too friendly or helpful to you and talk badly about other people close to you. Making you walk on eggshells so it's hard to say no, so they'll have tantrums (which you will be made to believe are your fault) Things like trying to get you to move in with them way too early in the relationship. Trying to take financial control. Putting you in a position where you rely on them souly. Moving you away for others. Also making it seem like they need you to survive. 

Heard for single parents have to be wary for people who push boundaries with them, their kids, gifts, babysitting etc when they hardly know them very well. Since its a grooming tactic used by pedophiles to gain access from people who need help. 

With sex trafficking, many people get find their partner rushes things, gives them gifts, moves them in. Then suddenly they need help with money and this poor person (who has in reality fallen in love with a manipulative pimp) sleeps with their partners 'friends' for money to save what is a fake relationship. 

Mens advice line sums it up well what it is like with this person if the relationship is abusive: 

Domestic violence includes a range of behaviours: physical, psychological, sexual or financial abuse. It happens within intimate relationships as well as between family members. It forms a pattern of bullying and controlling behaviours. It is rarely a one-off event and it tends to get worse over time. Abusers can be very manipulative in the way they use their power and control over you and may blame you and other factors for their abusive behaviours.

If you are forced to change the way you behave because you are frightened of your partners reaction, it is likely you are  being abused. If you feel afraid, walking on eggshells, intimidated by your partner, it is likely you are being abused. If there is conflict in your relationship and your partner hurts you (physically, emotionally etc) it is likely you are being abused. </TEXT>

Some breeds of dog need very careful and controlled care too like staffies. Even Huskies shouldn't be let off the leash and seen few owners do that (risks them running off into roads or attacking farm animals)

Agree that some breeds need licences to prove you can control a difficult breed.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> She even made good choice in learning self defence.

Odds are the stalker must have approached her at some point maybe that's why she recognised something. Church or past history at a school could explain not recognising it 100%

Father is unlikely if he wanted to control her family abusers could use other routes. could be someone she knew or had vendetta with the family for crazy reasons. 

Wonder what the odds are the killer is now dead or convicted of domestic abuse if they found someone new. Maybe they've threatened someone else in similar ways.

What is good about the articles is how it focuses a lot on the victims and the tragedy of their deaths. Then the focus on the killer/s. Think Paulys death in the craiglist killer hit me hard due to how happy he was and how close he was to his friend. 

Jessica Chambers article is an interesting cautionary tale for anyone looking to investigate things themselves and end up harassing grieving family and friends  </TEXT>

You did well to stop the shopping but still bringing it in or telling her where you brought it is an issue. 

Keep chats work related for her and with others. However, she might notice and even direct (like saying, please stop copying me) or indirect action might hurt her or cause trouble. Either way stay professional in the eyes of the boss. 

Don't forget to lock your computer and maybe buy one of the screen shields which makes it hard for people to snoop. 

If you can't change jobs, can you get into a project elsewhere or switch teams/departments? promote your way out of it if the opportunity appears

[The grandpas creepy night time running was him pushing his new body to the limits since he's obsessed with being beaten by Jesse Owens. The grandma acts like an old housewife. At the party they greet everyone like old friends. Old golf guy and brother wonder if Chris does the sport they're into (and all the others check out his body etc). They don't want him to smoke/damage his body.](/spoiler) </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to local police data, the number of missing child cases in the District dropped from 2,433 in 2015 to 2,242 in 2016. The highest total recently, 2,610, was back in 2001.

But the increased social media attention has caused concern in the U.S. capital area, which has long had a large minority population and is currently about 48 percent black. Hundreds of people packed a town-hall style meeting at a neighborhood school on Wednesday to express concern about the missing children cases.

Ten children of color went missing in our nations capital in a period of two weeks and at first garnered very little media attention. Thats deeply disturbing, Richmonds letter said.

Derrica Wilson, co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation, said that despite the assurances from police, it was alarming for so many children to go missing around the same time. On Tuesday night, she noted, her group had four reports of missing children and only one had been found.

We cant focus on the numbers. If we have one missing child, thats one too many, Wilson said.

Wilson said she is concerned about whether human trafficking is a factor, citing the case of 8-year-old Relisha Rudd, who has been missing since she vanished from a city homeless shelter in 2014. A janitor who worked at the shelter was found dead of apparent suicide during the search for the girl.

They prey on the homeless, they prey on low income children, they prey on the runaways, they prey online, Wilson said. </TEXT>

Also after Le Pen was caught getting Russian money and EU wanted to investigate this kind of funding Farage tried to block it.

Russia didn't create these groups but they are funding or using its army of digital army to help them. Sounds like they approached BNP first but wouldn't be surprised if they made contact with UKIP or sold leaders hidden shares in energy companies.

I guess a bigger example is Mandela, he did turn his back on violence and become one of the biggest spokesmen for peace. People still try to point out his past to overshadow him as an advocate peace in his later years. As people in politics go they admit they made mistakes and changed which should be done more. Maybe in a twisted way it takes someone who went through that hatred to understand the importance of stopping it.  </TEXT>

On the role of the alt-right websites he controlled in the US elections, Dowson said he was spreading devastating anti-Clinton, pro-Trump memes and soundbites into sections of the population too disillusioned with politics to have taken any notice of conventional campaigning.

<TEXT> You can buy it off amazon cheap and one person got a refund since it was sold as fake fur. It's not a luxury object now and there are tell tell signs.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38302019

"We know the vast majority of British people don't want to buy fur ethically and morally, but we are seeing an increase in it on our streets,' says Claire Bass, director of Humane Society International UK.

"Consumers are being duped into buying real animal fur."
She adds: "Fur is tragically so cheap. It can be produced for the same or less than the cost of fake fur."

As part of an awareness campaign, the charity carried out laboratory tests on three items being sold as faux fur this winter, and found them to be made of mink, fox and rabbit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone else noticed the rise of real fur item sat market stalls or being worn by people. Maybe it's because I came from the era of wearing Fur being bad, but I find it's creeping me out how much more common it is in london now. 

We still get plenty of stories about animals being skinned alive or some fur farms using kidnapped dogs and cats to react to demands etc. Yet people still seem to be buying it or being able to buy/sell it cheaply. Have attitudes changed? 

To note it is legal to sell imported furs in the UK, just fur farms in the UK are banned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not the same as crystal therapy or the other stuff at all. 

LGBT has a high suicide rate. This kind of therapy makes the person feel like there is something wrong with them or that they are mentally ill. So as they fail to 'cure' it leaves people feeling worse than better and heightening that suicide risk. 

Would be far better for a professional to help them come to terms. If they go for religious reasons, it might be better to refer them to LGBT religious groups for spiritual support.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One issue raised as to why is Social Care units are also being shut down or dropping budgets. So all the social care needs are falling into A E. It's not really little Timmy and his sniffles, more like lonely unsupported Granny cannot be discharged due to lack of social care. 

Older people in England are being left "high and dry" by councils cutting back on the care they provide, Age UK says.

Research by the charity showed the numbers getting help had fallen from just over one million three years ago to 850,000 last year.

Age UK said the cuts were one of the major causes behind the growing pressures on A E units. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30902555

Over the past three months waiting times in A E units have reached their worst level for a decade with hospitals reporting they are experiencing particular problems trying to discharge old and frail patients because of the lack of support available in the community. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In reality more you think about it the more messed up it gets. Most real life vigilantes i hear of go after people rather than hang around waiting for crime to happen. Unlike police you're likely working off newspaper articles or the word of others which might not be true. Your just beating people you suspect are guilty so highly likely you're beating up an innocent person or they'll go to the press as a victim and people will be more sympathetic to them. Plus you'll get arrested and then beaten up in prison for it. 

Legal system can be slow but likely what makes it more fair than living in a world of mob violence over small matters.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hating or discriminating against someone for something they cannot control. Transgender people suffer lot worst abuse and threat of violence and death for being who they are. It being socially acceptable to dislike them or restrict their human rights feeds into this. 

For many transgender is a birth defect and not a mental illness (though it can cause mental illness like body dysmorphia if not treated). Like another variant of being born a hermaphrodite. So they seek surgery and medical processes to fix natures mix up. Question for many who have strong feelings against Transgender people seeking treatment is would you react the same if you met a hermaphrodite also seeking corrective gender treatment too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [here is the list of 19 hospitals under threat](https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/health/great-nhs-gamble-full-list-19-hospitals-facing-closure/) if they're in your area they likely have a campaign group you can join to save them. Either way google your local hospital or ask you doctor to see if they have any support groups. 

Also some speeches referred to the STP plan (Sustainability and Transformation) and how it'll downgrade and close hospitals. Hammersmith and Fulham council already refused to follow it. So they asked for people to contact thier councils to do the same.

It's 32 tablet box for three day use and has addiction warning on the box. Legally shouldn't this be brought with prescription? Kinda shocked how easy he got it

Does anyone who work there know how they've got the staff to come in on a major family holiday? Is it just lot of short shifts. 

Still pretty depressing to think people are working on Christmas Day in non emergency work.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I booked foxtons cleaning service (since i didn't trust they'd approve of any i'd book even with landlord being happy)

The Landlord told me he asked them to return my deposit and he also signed paper saying he is happy with the professional clean and no further work is required. Which they have and I have a copy. 

I called up last week asking and they said they needed landlord confirmation. I told them about paperwork they have and landlords chat with them. Then it was 'oh we're waiting to hear back from head office. Call us back next week.' They also said they'd send an email to confirm but haven't.

It's now Monday and I'm planning on calling back for update. I'm worried this all just purposeful delays and I've just read online other tenants having similar issues with them withholding deposits for months. I have pictures of the flat and all inventory accounted for and Landlord is happy with me, so I should be okay. Any legal means to get round delay tactics? I've never known estate agents to be this slow  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Over the years being left wing and anti-fascists you get to see tactics they use often to spread all the hatred and fear, which tends to spill into violence. 

Far rights groups are very territorial. They like to 'claim' areas or target areas of left wing, immigration, jewish/muslim citizens places of prayer, LGBT areas. 

They do this with lone wolf attacks, group harassment, leafleting, rallies. 

With the alt-right and the far right members of the Donald sub they have used the same tactics online. 

- They are using all the dirty tricks and rule bending they can to claim Front end of reddit as their own. They are a sub obsessed with being on the front page. 

- Stromfront and far right always moan reddit was 'too leftie' and it meant the site has become a target for winning territory. I've seen subs with good balance of left and right get overwhelmed with far right. like world news and europe subs. 

- They are obsessed with being seen as superior. 'alpha', 'beta', 'cuck' nonsense is a form of this.  

- On and Off site they harass dissenters and opposition voices.  

- They feed on fear of the other and spread lies in news and statistics to prove their world view to convert others. Even if the news is not fake they will try to use it to recruit. Like taking advantage of tragedies. 

- They are now trying to spread further with same dirty tricks to elections in other country. This anti-globalist movement is looking to claim international territory and expand their businesses overseas. 

- You've got your thugs and you got those who hide behind political language. Political language lot like to claim left wing speech like 'equality' or 'racism' to dog whistle white supremacy language. 

There must always be a counter movement to the far right. You have a voice and rules to oppose any rise of hatred, and show that it is not acceptable in society. You can't stand back and let far right rally un-opposed in areas they want to harass people in.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-28 18:44:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Posted this elsewhere but you guys might like to know too. 

I've heard it can take to the second island for you to get Abra evolved to Kadabra but it's not till level 21 where you can learn your first attacking move. Otherwise you're stuck with teleport and kinesis.

I'm still early game myself but might have found a way to get at least one TM move into Abra before the second island. Though if you're further than me, let me know if it worked.


Spoilers...Mostly about first island challenges. 

In the WIki is says at Hau'oli City you can pick up TM48 Round which the wiki also says Abra can learn (hopefully true in this game). However, you need to be able to talk so someone in the mall which can only be reached after completing the island Grand Trial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/this-is-how-steve-bannon-sees-the-entire-world?bffbmain ref=bffbmain utm_term=.asPwOkXV5#.gyvR9NVJx

Buzzfeed article with a transcript of Bannons Vatican speech. 

Bannon praises the tea party and likes groups like UKIP and see's the establishment GOP as his enemies. So this is why it'll be interesting to see who purges who first out of the government. 

Bannon: Outside of Fox News and the Drudge Report, were the third-largest conservative news site and, quite frankly, we have a bigger global reach than even Fox. And thats why were expanding so much internationally.

Look, we believe  strongly  that there is a global tea party movement. Weve seen that. We were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front National and other center right. With all the baggage that those groups bring  and trust me, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially  but we think that will all be worked through with time.

[...]

One is crony capitalism, or what we call state-controlled capitalism, and thats the big thing the tea party is fighting in the United States, and really the tea partys biggest fight is not with the left, because were not there yet. The biggest fight the tea party has today is just like UKIP. UKIPs biggest fight is with the Conservative Party.
The tea party in the United States biggest fight is with the the Republican establishment, which is really a collection of crony capitalists that feel that they have a different set of rules of how theyre going to comport themselves and how theyre going to run things. And, quite frankly, its the reason that the United States financial situation is so dire, particularly our balance sheet. We have virtually a hundred trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities. That is all because youve had this kind of crony capitalism in Washington, DC. The rise of Breitbart is directly tied to being the voice of that center-right opposition. And, quite frankly, were winning many, many victories. 

Some say this speech is intellectual, he sounds dumb or trying to pretend FN and UKIP can be mentioned in same grouping as the center-right or can be changed on their ethical/racial issues. They are the political arm of the far right. </TEXT>

Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. How did we get to this point? And what do we do now?

If you can afford the time or money, here are some organizations that are worth supporting

To support womens health, donate to Planned Parenthood (plannedparenthood.org) or the Center for Reproductive Rights (reproductiverights.org).

If you dont believe manmade global warming is a silly issue, give to the Natural Resources Defense Council (nrdc.org).

If you dont think refugees are a terrorist army in disguise, donate to the International Refugee Assistance Project (refugeerights.org).

You may also want to donate to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund (naacpldf.org), the Trevor Project for LGBT youth (thetrevorproject.org), or the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (maldef.org).

And to support journalism, subscribe to a newspaper and donate to ProPublica (propublica.org). </TEXT>

Most of the political guys in far right don't dirty thier hands by walking around like thugs. Yet they do struggle to keep thier bigotry inside because they are aware of public image. This guy has some tell tell signs and even Trump fans if they truly believe in unifying all Americans no matter religion or race. This guy should at the very least raise an eyebrow over that red hat. If not for those comments then maybe for being former Walk Street guy (you know the people Trump is meant to be against to make America great again) 

If a guy who did hostile take overs in Wall Street and clearly judges entire group as a negative. I don't see how he can help strategies which will only target 'bad ones'.  </TEXT>

So stay safe out there. Uncertainty but damn the scary stuff is already rumbling. I'd argue (for just in case) organise a safe house and back up plans to dodge and resist any authoritarian stuff about to hit.

<TEXT> Urge your DNC representatives to get the DNC sorted by the time Trump is sworn in. 

As a Labour supporter in the UK it has been frustrating seeing the constant Leadership challenges and battles in the party as the Conservatives are making their cuts and changes. 

All media coverage has been about the infighting and none of the challenges to the government policy or the alternatives to fix the issues. It's left the party not fully being in opposition, which has been a win for the Conservatives who sorted their leadership battles swiftly.

If you want a new DNC get it ready before Trump and the Republicans start there new day in power. Otherwise you wont be in a strong enough opposition for democracy and debate to work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been thinking about climate change and what to do for a while. There's lot of talk about how meat industry and transport of veg/fruit has a huge impact and changing your personal tastes can help.

So I've been thinking about changing my diet. Eating less meat, more chicken, vegetarian/vegan recipes, maybe rotating seasonal fruit/veg to rely less on food that had high air miles etc.
It might do nothing, but might be quite good (lot of large food companies have change business to react to healthy diets people want.)

Anyone else doing this? Any meal ideas worth trying or sources to pull ideas from?

So far found following sites which talk about seasonal foods to start building meal ideas from.

<TITLE> Don't let anyone now or in next two-four years shame you for protesting or becoming an activist. Remember your rights and the rights of others you are protecting with the constitution. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-10 09:28:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There will be criticism and that is fair enough to listen to. But don't fall for the trap of thinking that any form of activism or protest is wrong or worthless. 

In Bushes government there were anti-war and occupy movements after the sub prime mortgage crash. Yet even with this I suspect Trump might bring about an era of activism we haven't seen since the Hippies or the Reagan era Punks. 

We saw lot of progress with Obama kicking off more LGBT protections, early healthcare reform, climate change talks and general celebration of sciences and much more. I can see why people are protesting since the Republican Party (not just Trump) past behaviour shows they will seek to reverse lot of the things people feel was needed and is still needed on our society together.

It's early days. We shall see what happens if activism is needed or not to protect rights, justice, liberty and freedoms (and all buzzwords America should stand for) for yourself and other people over the next four years.

If it's worst case there will be struggle. You cannot dismiss alt right/trump/republicans etc for being only angry old guys or sad virgins alone in basements. They are mixed and they are more active. Dismissing them has gotten you here and if you sit at home doing nothing you are the dumb angry old guys or basement dwellers who don't do anything. Even the hippies who are mocked as weak went out to face Nixons national guard and to get beaten by batons. That's not weak it takes balls. 

They will try to shame you as troublemakers, traitors, dumb kids, globalists, SJW, liberal (like it's a swear word) a threat. Yet keep on fighting to protect rights of others.

You know who the biggest suckheads in the world are? The people who think they're clever by saying, 'Well, I happen to be politically IN-correct.' And now you get to act like you're a cutting edge rebel, because you're reinforcing the oppressive status quo! You sack of fucking rancid horse assholes! - Barry Crimmins 

Join a political party today, the democrats and Bernie will sure need it. Yet go for whichever group you believe in.

Fundraise and work for activist groups who will have a busy four years protecting those they care for.

When Sergei Millian was appointed head of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce in the US in 2006, the young former Soviet migr came to typify Russias new projection of soft power.

He gave dozens of interviews to Russian state media as an expert on the US and appeared on US television opposing sanctions on Russia. He gadded about town with New York luxury real-estate brokers, even appearing on a reality TV programme called Million Dollar Listing, prompting one newspaper to nickname him The Moscow Mule.

Friends approved when he posted a photograph on Facebook in 2014 of himself with Donald Trump and Jorge Perez, the billionaire owner of the Related Group, a Miami real-estate developer, at the races. Then this year, Mr Millian, now 36, began speaking of how Russia-US relations would improve under the presidency of Mr Trump, with whose organisation he said he had worked as a real-estate broker and maintained ties. I can assure you he is very positive and friendly, he told the Russian state news agency, Ria Novosti, in January.

In the past, such activities might have seemed harmless. But now the US administration has formally accused Russia of attempting to interfere in the US electoral process through the hacking of the Democratic National Committees email servers, Mr Millians activities  and his ties to the Republican presidential nominee  are coming under increasing scrutiny.

Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, has called Mr Trump a Kremlin puppet, pointing to his pro-Moscow advisers and his consistently pro-Putin line. Mr Trump has played down his links to Russia.

But questions are mounting over whether Mr Millian was one of a number of people who could have acted as intermediaries to build ties between Moscow and Mr Trump. This comes after Paul Manafort resigned earlier this year as Mr Trumps campaign chief after controversy over his years of consulting work for Viktor Yanukovich, the pro-Moscow former president of Ukraine.

At the same time, the US intelligence community is grappling with the fact that Russian intelligence operations on US soil may be more extensive than previously thought. As Russia has sought to restore its standing on the world stage, it has poured funding into soft power outfits such as Russia Today, a state-run global television channel, and Rossotrudnichestvo, a state entity that organises cultural exchanges. Similar organisations were used in Soviet times as a front for espionage.

A debate is deepening in Washington over how to deal with such Russian institutions and whether they should register under the Foreign Agent Registration act, according to a former senior US administration official. The debate is being closely tracked by the FBI, the official said.

Mr Millian insists his Russian American Chamber of Commerce (RACC) has nothing to do with the Russian government. He says it is funded by payments from its commercial members alone.

Most of the board members are obscure entities and nearly half of their telephone numbers went unanswered when called by the Financial Times.An FT reporter found no trace of the Chamber of Commerce at the Wall Street address listed on its website. At the same time, the chamber appears to have close official ties, arranging trips for visiting Russian regional governors to the US. In January 2015, the Russian government awarded Mr Millian a prize for his work developing ties between Russian and American businesspeople.

Mr Millian warned of false accusations and negligent reporting. He said the chamber of commerce keeps an official office address registered at Wall Street and pays for the service provided. He added that it had cut most of its services and activities in the US and Russia due to the adverse political situation.

For Konstantin Borovoi, a former Russian MP and businessman who was president of Russias first commodities exchange, the chambers type of operations hark back to cold war practices. In Soviet times, the American Trade Chamber was the official representative office of the secret services, said Mr Borovoi, who is also an expert on the KGB. These institutions have been revived and developed, he said. The chamber of commerce institutions are the visible part of the agent network  Russia has spent huge amounts of money on this.

Mr Millian came on to the FBIs radar after he participated in a 2011 trip to Moscow for 50 US businessmen and offered to organise further trips. The FBI pulled in the US participants to ask them whether Russian intelligence tried to recruit them during the all-expenses paid trip, three attendees told the Financial Times. One of them said the FBI told him they suspected that some of the people who organised the trips were spies.

The questioning formed part of a wider FBI probe into whether Yury Zaytsev, the head of the Washington DC arm of Rossotrudnichestvo, was recruiting for Russian intelligence. Mr Zaytsev had been the lead organiser for the trip. The Russian foreign ministry said reports of the probe were fabrications that had nothing to do with reality. Mr Zaytsev, however, quietly returned to Russia shortly after the FBI probe, dismissing the accusation as no more than an echo of the cold war.

Mr Millian remained in the US, writing to thank then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev following the trip and offering to help organise more such visits, according to a copy of his letter seen by the FT.

The FBI probe was part of a wake-up call for US intelligence over suspicions that Russia was activating networks long thought defunct after the end of the cold war. The number of Russian intelligence operatives in the US is much higher than anyone thought, one former senior US intelligence official said.

By the time of the trip, Mr Millian had built extensive ties with Mr Trump and his organisation, according to boasts he made in an in-depth interview with Russian state agency Ria Novosti in April this year. He praised Mr Trump for developing business projects with Russian speakers in the US, citing Trump SoHo in New York, a project led by Tamir Sapir, a Georgian billionaire who started out in the US selling electronic goods to visiting Soviet officials.

Mr Millian told Ria he first met Mr Trump after mutual acquaintances helped organise a visit by the real-estate mogul to the 2007 Millionaires Fair in Moscow. Mr Trump invited him to horse races in Miami shortly afterwards, he said  a statement that chimes with the Facebook photograph he posted.

Mr Millian claimed Mr Trump then introduced him to Michael Cohen, the Trump Organisations chief legal counsel, who granted him rights to market Trump Organisation properties in Russia and the former Soviet Union. You could say I was their exclusive broker, he told Ria. Then, in 2007-2008, dozens of Russians bought apartments in Trump properties in the US. He later told ABC television that the Trump Organisation had received hundreds of millions of dollars through deals with Russian businessmen.

Now that scrutiny has increased, Mr Millian has played down his connections with Mr Trump. He declined repeated requests for an interview and left the US for Asia on a business trip in early October. In emailed responses to questions from the Financial Times, Mr Millian described himself as one of several brokers who worked on Mr Trumps real estate projects. I never represented Mr Trump personally and I am not working with Mr Trump, he said. I have never been paid by Mr Trump for any work. He added that he had never consulted Mr Trump on any political topic.

The chamber of commerce removed from its website earlier this year an April 2009 newsletter, where Mr Millian said the chamber had signed formal agreements with the Trump Organisation, Mr Perezs Related Group and one other company to jointly service the Russian clients commercial, residential and industrial real-estate needs.

Mr Cohen dismissed Mr Millians earlier comments about his work with Mr Trump as nothing more than a weak attempt to align himself with Mr Trumps overwhelmingly successful brand. Mr Cohen did not respond to questions about whether he interacted with Mr Millian or why Mr Millian is one of only 100 people he follows on Twitter. The Related Group, in a carefully worded statement, said it had no record of any dealings with Mr Millian.

Hope Hicks, Mr Trumps campaign spokeswoman, said Mr Trump had met and spoke with Mr Millian only on one occasion almost a decade ago at a hotel opening.

One of the chambers main backers is Mikhail Morgulis, a prominent Soviet migr who also serves as Belarus honorary consul to the US. He told the FT Mr Millian had explained to him he was helping Mr Trump and the Republican party. We have soft power and we are trying to change relations now, Mr Morgulis said.

Russia is officially denying any suggestion it is interfering in the US electoral process or supporting Mr Trump. For Konstantin Zatullin, head of the Russian parliaments CIS affairs committee and a vocal proponent of restoring Russian power, the accusations are redolent of McCarthyism.

But behind the denials, a tinge of pride is visible. While the west was playing with James Bond  we turned our attention to gaining respect, said Mr Zatullin. When the west thought the cold war competition was over, they lost respect for their opponent. Now they are waking up to this again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every time this story pops up in the news it feels like I'm putting on a Cold War tin foil hat on. 

Yet if there's any truth in it (investigations is concerning enough), we should be very concerned with how the far right is getting a boost. It does feel like more and more online far right are getting more support or at least handed resources to push their agenda. Feels like we're too many steps behind shady funding or not. 

Issue is there were also stories (think Adam Curtis) who said Putin campaign guy also funds far left to confuse or create this kind of left vs right internal conflict.

<TITLE> How to listen and talk to a friend you're worried about. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-03 12:31:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://www.samaritans.org/difficultconversations

There's been lot of discussion about Men sharing thier feelings more when going through a crisis. Yet some people have made interesting points 'it's not just about talking it's also about learning how to listen or helping someone start that conversation.'

Samaritans to me has really good outline on how to talk to someone you're worried about. Going to post full article below v, but there is more on their website:

**HOW TO START A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION**

If you're worried about someone try to get them to talk to you.

* Often people want to talk, but wait until someone asks how they are. Try asking open questions, like 'What happened about...', 'Tell me about...', 'How do you feel about...'

* Repeat back what they say to show you understand, and ask more questions.

* Focus on your friend's feelings instead of trying to solve the problem - it can be of more help and shows you care.

* Respect what they tell you. Sometimes it's easy to want to try and fix a person's problems, or give them advice. Let them make their own decisions.
 
**How do I start a conversation with someone Im concerned about?**

You might feel that you don't know how to help someone, because you don't know what to tell them or how to solve their problems.

You dont need to be an expert. In fact, sometimes people who think they have the answers to a problem are less helpful.

Dont forget that every person is different, so that what worked for one will not always work for another.

**Find a good time and place**

Think about where and when to have the conversation before you start.

Choose somewhere where the other person feels comfortable and has time to talk.

**Ask gentle questions, and listen with care**

You might feel that you don't know how to help someone, because you don't know what to tell them. But you shouldn't tell them anything. Telling doesn't help.

The best way to help is to ask questions. That way you leave the other person in control. By asking questions, the person you are talking with finds his or her own answers. 

**The more open the question the better**

Questions that help someone talk through their problems instead of  saying yes or no are the most useful. Questions like:

* When  'When did you realise?'

* Where  'Where did that happen?'

* What  'What else happened?'

* How  'How did that feel?'

* Why  be careful with this one as it can make someone defensive. What made you choose that or What were you thinking about at the time are more effective.
At Samaritans, we call this style of conversation active listening.

**Find out how they feel**

Dont forget to ask how this person is feeling. Sometimes people will talk you through all the facts of what happened, why it happened and what actions they are thinking of taking, but never say how they actually feel.

Revealing your innermost emotions - anger, sadness, fear, hope, jealously, despair and so on  can be a huge relief. It sometimes also gives clues about what the person is really most worried about.

**Check they know where to get help**

If someone has been feeling low for some time it is probably a good idea that they get some support, whether it is through talking to someone like a counsellor or getting some practical help.

Useful questions you might ask them include:

* Have you talked to anyone else about this?

* Would you like to get some help?

* Would you like me to come with you?

Or, for someone who is reluctant to get help:

* Do you have someone you trust you can go to?

* If it helps, you can talk to me any time.

You can also suggest to your friend that the following sources of help may be useful:

[Note these are from the UK, Menslib resource bar has more international links]

Samaritans (by phone on 116 123 or email jo[@]samaritans.org.
Befrienders Worldwide includes a directory of emotional support helplines around the world.
NHS 111 offers health advice in the UK and is free from landlines and mobiles.
A more comprehensive list of charities providing emotional support and help for mental illness can be found here.

**Respect what they tell you, dont pressure them**

If they dont want help, dont push them. Sometimes its easy to want to try and fix a persons problems, or give them advice.

Its usually better for people to make their own decisions. Help them think of all the options, but leave the choice to them.

Being there for them in other ways, like through socialising or helping with practical things, can also be a great source of support.

**If you say the wrong thing, dont panic**

There is no perfect way to handle a difficult conversation, so dont be too hard on yourself if it didnt go as well as you had hoped. 

If you feel able to, put things right: Last week I said  and I realise now that was insensitive so Im sorry. What I meant to say was 

**Show you understand**

Ask follow-up questions and repeat back the key things your friend has told you, using phrases like So youre saying, So you think.

**Look after yourself, and talk to someone too**

Hearing someone elses worries or problems can affect you too. Take time for yourself to do the things you enjoy, and if you need to talk, find somebody you trust to confide in.

If you promised not to tell anyone else, you can call us, and well keep it private.

Dont take on so much of other peoples problems that you yourself start feeling depressed. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-09-07 14:05:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> via his facebook page

Londons iconic clubs are an essential part of our cultural landscape.
Clubbing needs to be safe but Im disappointed that Fabric, Islington Council and the Metropolitan Police were unable to reach agreement on how to address concerns about public safety.
As a result of this decision, thousands of people who enjoyed going to Fabric as an essential part of London's nightlife will lose out.

The issues faced by Fabric point to a wider problem of how we protect Londons night-time economy, while ensuring it is safe and enjoyable for everyone.

Over the past eight years, London has lost 50 percent of its nightclubs and 40 percent of its live music venues. This decline must stop if London is to retain its status as a 24-hour city with a world-class nightlife.
I am in the process of appointing a Night Czar who will bring together key stakeholders including club and venue owners, local authorities, the Metropolitan Police and members of the public.

No single organisation or public body can solve these problems alone  we all need to work together to ensure London thrives as a 24-hour city, in a way that is safe and enjoyable for everyone. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-08-15 13:11:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm listening to [Chain Reaction on BBC radio](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lgkzc?ns_mchannel=social ns_campaign=bbc_radio_4 ns_source=twitter ns_linkname=radio_and_music) (it's a tag team chat show where last weeks guest is this weeks interviewer)

This episode is one where Alan Moore is interviewing Brian Eno and highlights how Eno's uses Libraries, which I thought I'd share. 

Eno would make note of the licence plates near his library before walking in. He would then use these numbers to create a basic dewy decimal reference number and find the book in the library which matches it. 

It meant he would read more books on subjects and areas he might not have looked at before and would give him ideas or new areas of knowledge.

<TITLE> [Spoilers Everything] Fun facts about Demogorgon from mythology </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-11 16:32:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [According to Giovanni Boccaccio's Genealogy of the Pagan Gods](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YGUhj8rcbm4C pg=PA794 lpg=PA794 dq=Thebaid+4.516 source=bl ots=6bPwILbUHI sig=F1qyuzaGc1YVmOC-Kc8sZBT0uio hl=en sa=X ved=0ahUKEwjTho7HvrnOAhUrGZoKHZzHA8YQ6AEIJDAB#v=snippet q=tenth%20child%20demogorgon f=false) the Demogorgon had 9 children. The eight is Earth and the ninth is Erebus. Child of Demogorgon Erebus had 21 children, [the Eleventh was Hunger.](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YGUhj8rcbm4C lpg=PA794 ots=6bPwILbUHI dq=Thebaid%204.516 pg=PA115#v=onepage q=hunger f=false)

This god, as has been said, the ancients calls the Demogorgon. That they were born from Erebus and Night, as Cicero says, can be explained in this way. Erebus, as will be explained more fully later, is the deepest and most hidden place on earth. Allegorically we can understand this as the profundity of the divine mind into which the human eye cannot penetrate. And because the divine mind can really see itself, knowing what it will do, and therefore produced them in an act with nature, we can surely say that they were born from Erebus, that is, the from the arcane and most profound inner sanctum of the divine mind.


Not sure if the show was having fun nodding to mythology though.Pretty cool that Eleven is first seen as very hungry and may also got her powers from when her mother was in the psychic tank, the same place she crossed dimensions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to transfer Pokemon, but sometimes I keep them since I can see it has a powerful move which might be useful in battles. As my multiple Hypnos have different special moves and some are more powerful attacks than others

Are there any Strong moves on 'x' Pokemon you don't want to lose in a transfer. Where even with low CP, later on it might be worth powering up that Pokemon. 

Also does evolving always change the move your Pokemon has?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Picking teams by experience for new players   Gym tips </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-14 13:31:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So got the game early. So if you're going to be joining a team in the future. Here are some observations on what it's like once you pick.

Overall seen some people hold gyms for a long time and seen gyms shift hands within minutes. You can still get XP and coins if you go back and win back that gym within time. 

On fighting gyms. Running can still give out damage to the gym if you at least beat one pokemon. So there's an exploit of taking out lowest levels pokemon first. tap to attack. when blue box is fill hold down till it releases the special attack. swipe to dodge (some players say screen at the corner flashes yellow before an attack). Train a gym up to make it harder to defeat for rivals. You can add pokemon to your teams gym if its at the right level and not being battled on.

**Red Valor** - Defender. Due to larger numbers your are more likely to see red Gyms with larger teams of players defending it. Strategy is what pokemon to have on the gym and which to take with you to take the next gym. 

**Blue Mystic** - Attacker/Defender. Also high numbers of players. Yet in my experience usually not as many people defending gyms as reds but lot of them attacking gyms and holding them for longer than Yellow.  

**Yellow Instinct** - Raiders. Low numbers of players mean holding or leveling up gyms is difficult. More likely going to be raiding gyms for quick XP boosts and defended coins if its a frequent gym for raiding. Will most likely always have their most powerful pokemon on them. 

Though this can still vary where you live, yellows can be defenders if you notice high amount of local players in your area etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was thinking about different game experiences people have for each team. 

Reds must be defenders. They like to hold their gyms with teams of people. 

Blue are kinda between us and Reds, they attack a lot of red places. Sometimes they have teams to hold them. 

We, by our smaller numbers, are the trouble makers, the raiders, the pirates and the little ninjas. We don't hold gyms for long or level them up much. Yet we strike to break the blue and reds team defense. 

We harvest XP or the defense bonus and we move on. Till next team tries to build bigger defenses for us to raid.  </TEXT>

Heard suggestions elsewhere Go players should litter pick while out at gyms.

Anything else? Maybe from leaving tips in pubs we take gyms from, helping other players. Dropping lures near places which need them. If trading comes in when Europe goes live maybe giving high level Pokemon to people who didn't get the game early etc.  </TEXT>

**Salary of MEPs**

MEPs, in general, receive the same salary under the single statute which came into effect in July 2009.

The monthly pre-tax salary of MEPs under the single statute is 8,213.02 as of 1.7.2015. The salary comes from Parliament's budget and is subject to an EU tax and insurance contributions, after which the salary is 6,400.04. Member States may also subject the salary to national taxes. The basic salary is set at 38.5% of the basic salary of a judge at the European Court of Justice.

There are a few exceptions: MEPs who held a mandate in Parliament before the 2009 elections could opt to keep the previous national system for salary, transitional allowance and pensions.

**Pensions**

Under the statute, former Members are entitled to an old-age pension from the age of 63. The pension equals 3.5% of the salary for each full years exercise of a mandate but not more than 70% in total. The cost of these pensions is met from the European Union budget.

An additional pension scheme, introduced for MEPs in 1989, was closed to new members from July 2009 and is being phased out.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/27/meps-final-payoff-157000

Departing MEPs get final payoff of up to 157,000
European parliamentarians who step down or lose seat entitled to 'transitional allowance' worth a maximum of two years' salary

All MEPs who step down or lose their seats are entitled to a "transitional allowance" of at least 39,000. The value of the payment increases with length of time in post, meaning the longest-serving MEPs could receive two years' salary after leaving. The allowance provides one month's salary for each year an MEP has been in parliament, with a minimum of six months and a maximum of 24.

The revelation follows a row last week over the second pensions to which many members of the European parliament are entitled, in addition to their statutory pension. The longest-serving MEPs accrue statutory pensions of up to 55,000  70% of their salary. They are entitled to draw this non-contributory pension, which is funded solely by the taxpayer, at age 63.

Many MEPs also have a second European parliament pension scheme, which is expected to pay out up to 41,000 a year. The fund, which closed to new applicants in 2009 and stopped accepting contributions, was criticised last week by Tory MP Philip Davies as "the perfect example of the grotesque self-serving extravagance of the EU".

Public anger escalated last week after it emerged that an "actuarial deficit" in the second pension scheme will require an extra 187m of taxpayer funding to plug the gap. UK taxpayers have already contributed more than 100m to the fund.

Out of Britain's 73 serving MEPs, 38 contributed to the European Parliament's "additional voluntary pension scheme". According to documents leaked to HansMartin Tillack, a German investigative journalist, and think tank Open Europe, many high-profile MEPs are members of the scheme, including Syed Kamall, Leader of Conservative MEPs; Glenis Willmott, the leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party; Sir Graham Watson, the president of the EUwide Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe; and Nigel Farage, leader of Ukip. </TEXT>

**Stephen Crabb** [Votes List](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11768/stephen_crabb/preseli_pembrokeshire/votes) These individual topic lists linked are long so add any you find important to the comments.

Voted Remain. 

Where he stands on Brexit (from bbc summary): 

Campaigned for Remain but now says: "The result was for the UK to leave the European Union. There can be no stepping back from that. It's a clear instruction to the government. There can be no attempt to dilute it, to sidestep it. And there will be no second referendum."

Mr Crabb has set out three aims for the EU negotiations: "One: controlling immigration, and for us this is a red line. The one message that came through louder than any other in the vote last week is that the British people want to control immigration. Two: it is vital that we seek to achieve as close an economic relation with the EU as we have now. Three: the end of the supremacy of EU law."


Voted Summary

Stephen Crabb is a Conservative MP, and on the vast majority of issues votes the same way as other Conservative MPs. 

However, Stephen Crabb sometimes differs from their party colleagues, such as: Stephen Crabb generally voted for removing hereditary peers from the House of Lords, while most Conservative MPs generally voted against. Stephen Crabb has never rebelled against their party in the current parliament

**Liam Fox** [Voting Record](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10213/liam_fox/north_somerset/votes)

Voted Leave.

Where he stands on Brexit: 

"I do not believe there is room for membership of the single market if it entails free movement of people. Those who voted to leave the EU would regard it as a betrayal and frankly they would be right. We do not need to be part of the single market to sell into it. Countries like the United States manage to do that very well. It is in our mutual interests to have a free and open trade relationship with our European partners but we cannot accept the concept of free movement of people as its cost."

**Michael Gove** [Voting Record](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11858/michael_gove/surrey_heath/votes)

Voted Leave

Where he stands on Brexit:  

"The British people voted for change last Thursday... they want Britain to leave the European Union and end the supremacy of EU law. They told us to restore democratic control of immigration policy and to spend their money on national priorities such as health, education and science instead of giving it to Brussels. They rejected politics as usual and government as usual. They want and need a new approach to running this country."

He said "huge challenges" but also "huge opportunities" lay ahead for the UK.

He ruled out a snap general election if he becomes PM - and he said he would abandon Chancellor George Osborne's target of eliminating Britain's budget deficit by 2020. Mr Osborne himself has since abandoned the target.

He said he would wait until at least until 2017 to kick off the two-year process of negotiating the UK's withdrawal by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

"I will only trigger it after extensive preliminary talks ... so I have no expectation that Article 50 would be triggered in this calendar year," he said.

**Andrea Leadsom** [Voting record](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/24829/andrea_leadsom/south_northamptonshire/votes)

Voted Leave

She has described the referendum result as "a huge opportunity for our great country". She believes in scrapping free movement and wants to do free trade negotiations with the rest of the world.

Mrs Leadsom told Sky News: "My personal view very genuinely is the next leader is someone who has to deliver on the promise of the referendum because they can see the huge advantages and they believe in them. I think it's very difficult for somebody who campaigned to stay in, who thinks that there will be disaster if we leave to suddenly turn it around and start believing we can make a go of it."


Voted Summary

Andrea Leadsom is a Conservative MP, and on the vast majority of issues votes the same way as other Conservative MPs. 

However, Andrea Leadsom sometimes differs from their party colleagues, such as: Andrea Leadsom consistently voted for removing hereditary peers from the House of Lords, while most Conservative MPs generally voted against.

**Theresa May** [Voting Record](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10426/theresa_may/maidenhead/votes)

Voted Remain 

Backed Remain campaign but says vote to come out must be respected: "Brexit means Brexit... There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door and no second referendum." Mrs May also said there should be no general election before 2020 and no "emergency" Brexit budget - and that she would abandon the target of eliminating Britain's Budget deficit by the end of the decade, a day before the chancellor himself abandoned it.

Setting out her priorities for Brexit negotiations, she said "it must be a priority to allow British companies to trade with the single market in goods and services but also to regain more control of the numbers of people who are coming here from Europe". "Any attempt to wriggle out of that, especially from leadership candidates who campaigned to leave the EU by focusing on immigration, will be unacceptable to the public."


Voted Summary

Theresa May is a Conservative MP, and on the vast majority of issues votes the same way as other Conservative MPs.

<TEXT> So after the death of Walder Frey I thought 'oh good Ayra will be off to Winterfell next for the Stark reunion.'

Yet realized it's more likely she'll travel south with Jamie Lannisters camp. Since most of her next targets are in Kings Landing. Also word about the Starks taking over Winterfell hasn't reached Walder Frey so it's unlikely she'd know to go there. 

I doubt she'll be successful against Cersei (that's a younger brothers/valonqar job). But I wonder if she'll try another Shakespearean attempt show wise (like the pie) by setting up a play murder. As she knows the Joffery play off by heart and was told she'd be good on the stage by the the star actress. The play is exactly the kind of thing Cersei would want in Kings Landing after seizing power and destroying what the Sparrows did.

Though the Red Woman is on her list and is also travelling South. If they run into each other Ayra will get that magical necklace which would up her game in changing faces. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The good and ugly side of coming out, and why it was worth it. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-26 22:37:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I posted some [Pride Nerves](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/4phowr/pride_nerves) where I mentioned I was nervous for coming out and also nervous how I'd be accepted at pride with my partner. As we're opposite gender. 

I mentioned ugly in the title, so read on at your own capability for it. 

**The ugly**: Told my dad I was going to pride during our friday facetime chat. He wondered why. I went 'well...I am Bi.' I knew his reaction might not be good, but there was some hope. He's bit Jekyll and Hyde on everything. He had gay friends when hitchhiking and always said they were lovely couple. Yet when my mom left him, she left for London and lived with her gay friends. My dad blamed them for decades (and not his shitty behavior to my mum) for the divorce and has been homophobic about it. This made moving to London for me very difficult later on in life. He still hates the fact i live in London and have a boyfriend. He's very overprotective and if he got his way even seeing me as hetro. He would want me to be single and take care of him. He's usually most happy when people break up with me than when I start dating someone new (of course he even knew about the guys).

So when I said the words Bi, he went from cheerful dad to utter repulsion. He really used the words 'eeew', 'Thats disgusting', 'you're not gay', 'you should have a family', 'the gays and London have gotten to you, they've sucked you in. don't go. this is what they do'. etc I tried to tell him nothing changes, I've known before I moved to london, this isn't about his divorce etc. He wouldn't listen. We hung up. I cried. I warned my sisters. Between me typing to them, he called my sister. Who called me back and was on my side (yay) she said she was so proud of me and said I was brave (she knew all the good words from the coming out rule book). She said dad called her first and told her he was worried he had upset me. 

**The ugly improves a little**: So a while after my sister gives me her support. My dad calls again. He asks if he upset me and I cry again. He apologized and back tracks on what he said with 'I meant we shouldn't label things, it's just love' and 'i had gay friends'. He admitted the hurt from the divorce affected what he said. We had a good chat and made up. I mentioned I was nervous about pride. I explained me and my partner might not be as welcome due to biphobia from LGBT side as much as straight side. He said 'you go, you deserve to be there as much as anyone else.' So at least he was supportive to me going in the end. TBH his words hurt that evening and during pride. Yet i've cleared it out my mind now after much processing (which i will touch on later)

**The good**: Both my sisters are very supportive. One had Bi friend come out to them and knew the drill. The first sister who called me who was very supportive and sorted out my dad, has lot of gay friends and goes to pride. So she sorted my dad out. She mentioned I was brave and said 'if she was in my position she would not say anything'. Not sure why but it was still surprising when she told me she had slept with women before. So not sure if that's her way to say she's bi too and still hidden. My mother was very happy and proud. Excited i was going to be in the parade. She admitted she has dated women and knew since she was a kid she liked both (we're all a bit bi in this family!). She even agreed coming out is hard since you have to tell everyone and always need to tell new people. My partner came round to my flat when I told them how the dad call went, lots of hugs were had. I feel like I'm not alone in this. 

**Pride**: Went great. No one questioned me or my partner. The gay guy who was bi-evasive kept quiet and friendly. There were so many cheering faces and Bi flags and banners. I felt very welcome. It was nice boost after coming out and the mixed reaction. I was still bit nervous around people I don't know very well, but my partner kept my mood up. He was in Brexit blues and hadn't done much LGBT stuff for himself, so it was nice to hear how much he enjoyed the day and felt welcome in london. 

**Coming out post review**: I spent lot of time hurting over my dads words. No matter how much support I got from others or how he said sorry, it still stung. Despite how strained and difficult he can be, we still had a solid relationship. I think this has nuked it in some way, but life was strained already. Like I said moving to London already strained it and me being bi was always there but invisible. Instantly I questioned if I should of kept my mouth shut (or why did I tell the most difficult person first!). Watching Seinfeld and Curb like comedies helps this 'oh damn what did i say' moment. It' annoying this has become all about his negative feelings than my positives, but I feel this experience might helps others with the difficult people in out lives. 

Overall, it was a good thing. I wanted to be able to post pride or any activism online without hiding myself, he's on my social media so he was going to find out Friday or Saturday anyway. I know he wont be 100% okay with this and if I had been in same sex relationship this would be much harder. He can be quite needy so i'm wondering if i wont have to deal with that, now the golden child image has been nuked. But at least we talked about it.

I'm so glad I moved out and did this over the phone! I'd recommend it to anyone with difficult families. It allowed for the knee jerk, and on hanging up for the guilt to kick in for the negative reactions. I know I'm not disgusting, it just internal anger and past history I cannot control. All I did was tell someone something simple like 'I like these flavours of ice cream, I've always liked them' since to me being bi is no big deal. They make it into a big deal.

I'm still going to treat him like a caring daughter (and live my own life safe in the city) hopefully he can still continue as my dad. As I don't want this to turn me into hateful person, I'm still going to be a caring open hearted person. Even if as i argue with people online and they find my history, I will still listen to their views even if it comes from twisted place like my dads personal turmoil ;) I've still got lot of people out there who support me and will cheer me on.

When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you.  Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

**The Future** With some thought I don't regret what I did. Everyday that passes, I know it had to be done and I feel stronger now and whole. I can't lie though. I feel like I took a hit, a hard hit. I feel like I have lost the heterosexual privilege I had when in the closet with people I know. Even people who support me might act differently.

However, in a wider sense, we have to come out and take a hit for a future generation. My dad and others grew up in a world where we were a fetish perversion and criminals, we hid ourselves away. Thanks to those few people who came out fighting early on, I've been able to grow up in a world where we can have rights and have more open lives. We can parade in bigger happier numbers. Where police went from beating us up, to proposing to each other at pride. We've got to come out as Bi, even if it means taking a hit from family and LG individuals. So they know we are here and we won't be invisible any longer. So one day Bi people can come out and not take the hit we took. We keep coming out and keep working hard for the next generation. 

On a personal level I feel no different. Nothing has changed. Maybe people will act differently, but at least I'm no longer walking on eggshells and twisted with anxiety over it. I do feel bit more whole and stronger as a person, so if anything happens to me; family issues, a bad day at work, my team losing at match, drama, world war III, alien invasion etc. Pfft I got through this and came out better. Bring it on.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Group I've signed up with is taking part in my cities pride parade and i joined up to wave at people with my partner. 

Reasons to be nervous: 

* Me and my partner are both bi, but we are not same sex. So we're can easily be confused as hetro couple at events. So already feel like an outsider oddly. I'm planning on bringing bi colours and hoping my group supply some too. 

* One member of the group when mentioning i was bi laughed that Bi are greedy in a jokey way. Didn't bother me, but refereed to me as a lesbian later on which made other comments seem less jokey. No idea on the others taking part who might be chill or not (group says its LGBT and lots of people i'm not too familiar with.)

* I'm using my Pride participation to finally come out. Wondering how. I told some people who don't know i'm taking part but in my nerves wasn't clear that I'm not there just as an ally. They seemed awkward when i mentioned it. I'm tempted to just do it as facebook post as it reaches everyone in one go and I can deal with the awkward questions or people who don't like it later at a safer distance. Gah seems shitty though. 

What are your thoughts? am i ballsing up taking part in pride. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard there's a fair amount of incorrect information being used in this campaign (tbh and in other election) from fact checkers. 

My question is are there any regulations on this, or should there be? 

Bit like newspaper regulations, if it's shown an official campaign is using falsified figures should they be made to publish an apology and distribute it in same way they did the previous way? Or is there good reason why we shouldn't have this (like how they generate figures or easily abused by opposition campaigns). 

Thought i'd post this today and not when there's post result grumblings.

<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) In defense of one character [S6E9] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-20 13:15:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So lot of Sansa hate about not telling people about the Vale fighters. 

In her defense:

- Everyone who promises to save her, fails her at some point. She doesn't trust these words, they've gotten her into worse situations usually. She's doing better when making decisions herself or not trusting everyone by their word. 

- From what I recall after one viewing. When she warned Jon about Ramsey and talked to him about Rickon (someone she knew Ramsey might use or kill). Jon lost his temper and didn't listen to her about defending himself from traps. She knew Ramsey was going to land a trap and in that moment she knew Jon can easily lose his temper to fall for the trap. Telling Jon about the Vale then would mean he'd lead them into the trap too. It was best for her to not tell him in that moment, and hold her own troops back until they could attack with force.

- She had to play a game herself. Her character has been trapped by game players like Ramsey and Littlefinger. She's learnt a lot from watching them both and learnt a lot about how honorable men like her father die. She might be becoming a more cold and powerful woman than Lady Olenna. The ultimate game player and Queen in the north. We've had theories she will develop this way in the book i think.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Bit of a mad theory which I don't 100% believe myself (or want to).

Yet have we addressed there's a chance that Ayra did lose the fight? and the person who looks like Ayra is the Waif in changed identity. That she shed off the jealous girl character and is now Ayra. 

Finally, a girl is no one, So in death she finally became no one. 

Maybe the Faceless Men truly are faceless and can even remove their own faces to reach this level of worship. With Ayras death maybe they will follow through with her death list as payment as she kept praying for it. Did she come over as a trainee or as a customer.  

My memory is fuzzy on the waif book character, she doesn't seem to have same hate levels. Yet she does seem to be learning common tongue and other things from Ayra.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Currently there's lot of talk and action in comics revolving round changing timelines.

Though oddly seem people judging this online as permanent changes while we are reading stories where the possibility of changing timelines is mentioned. 

Tony Starks position in issue 1 is about not using the Inhuman Ulysses since we might be seeing a 'possibility' of the future. And if we even know his powers are really about seeing the definite future. If you ignore the minority report comparisons this could be a different story all together.

Civil war 0 she-hulk opens it up about people changing thier destiny and how it's not set in stone but our perception is. The jester was a bad guy but not anymore because he changed. 

We've seen Captain America change to Hydra and it looks like his past was altered (or at least this is the strongest theory). 

We are seeing stories about powers being used in the present which are changing people's past and future. We don't know much about these new powers or if they are changing reality. By the end of these storylines I suspect things will change again, people won't be evil or dead. Maybe we will get to see rhodes as president.

Any thoughts? Or am I clutching at straws and drinking marvel hope cool aid. Or have I missed some press of other issues which say otherwise  </TEXT>

Even though referendum isn't on individuals, still be interesting to see who we voted for and what they've been upto.

For example if UKIP meps wanted changes to immigration, have they done anything in EU parliament to try and change things.

<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) Who is the Shrouded Lord? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-28 00:10:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We've seen the Night King and the White Walkers raise an army of the undead. 

Yet we know of another person or creature with similar powers and origins. Plus we see a repeat of a women with an icey kiss to the Night Kings possible origins. 

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shrouded_Lord usuing the wiki for this one, also look up greyscale, grey plague, yi ti, Rhoynar and Asshai. 

The Shrouded Lord is said to rule the mists around the Sorrows since the time of Garin and to **spread greyscale through the grey kiss**, although he does not bestow his kiss lightly according to Haldon.[1]

According to some rumors, he is thought to be Prince Garin himself, risen from his watery grave. Others believe that there have been numerous Shrouded Lords, and when one dies another one takes his place; the one currently holding the title is a corsair from the Basilisk Isles. **Rolly Duckfield likes yet another version of the tale, in which the Shrouded Lord was a statue at first, and a grey woman from the fog kissed life to it with lips as cold as ice.**[2] They say the Shrouded Lord will grant a boon to any man who can make him laugh.[1] According to Septa Lemore the stone men were proud, and the Shrouded Lord was the proudest of all.

The curse of Greyscale was brought on by a Rhoynar. Who's magic could be like greenseers or like CotF

The captive prince called down a curse, and that night the Rhoyne flooded out of season, with greater force than known in living memory. A fog fell upon the city, and the Valyrian conquerors began to die of greyscale.[1] To this day, the ruins of Chroyane and that part of the river Rhoyne are known as the Sorrows, where the stone men live and travelers can still be infected with greyscale.

Legend has said that the Rhoynar had their own magic  a water magic very different from the sorceries of Valyria, which were woven of blood and fire. **It was said the Mother Rhoyne herself whispered to her children of every threat, that the Rhoynar princes wielded strange, uncanny powers, and that their cities were protected by "watery walls" that would rise to drown any foe.**

**The children of the forest may have had their own form of water magic. According to legend, their greenseers called upon the hammer of the waters twice in attempts to stop the First Men from invading Westeros.** The first use of the hammer of the waters resulted in the shattering of the Arm of Dorne into the Stepstones and the Broken Arm. The second attempt, to break Westeros in two, only resulted in the flooding of the Neck.

Like with abandoning Babies and taking the dead. The Stone Men get an increase of tributes and forces. 

They are rumoured to have a leader, the Shrouded Lord.[2] Thrice each year the triarchs of Volantis send a galley upriver with provisions, but they often deliver more afflicted than they do food.

and in the background of A Feast for Crows we're seeing an outbreak of Grey Plague in Yi Ti, which could be perfectly placed like a movement of Stone Men as we see movement of undead. The only other mention of Yi Ti is Jorah begging Dany to go there with him. It's not far from Asshai.

Garin tells Arianne Martell that according to sailors in Planky Town, grey plague, possibly referring to greyscale, has broken out in Yi Ti.

So is the Shrouded Lord a character we're yet to meet? Another less icey version of Night King. If so, would they be allies or enemies given the geography between them. One is made from Ice and other like stone forged from either water or fire. Is the Shrouded Lord also related to CotF?

If Shrouded Lord was created from icey womens kiss, are we sure the Night King isn't a woman (but that might take theory bit far) or if the Shrouded Lord is a woman or the very last CotF. Or if being near Asshai and hint Shrouded Lords can change with LSH be the next Shrouded Lord (lady) given she was brought back with Asshai magics. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rent Caps in other Capitols. Could London do the same? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-24 13:39:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Been hearing and reading about different rent controls implemented in different capitols and its ideal and slowly the speedy rises in rent prices. 

Some of these were introduced a while back, so do we know if they're working or if similar plans can be placed in London?

Some info below: 

Paris: The Loi Duflot is an attempt to tackle these problems head-on. When it comes into effect in 2016, agents fees will be capped, rental lists accessible by fee only will be banned and the number of documents required by prospective tenants will be cut. More radically still, high demand areas such as inner Paris will get rent caps. No new rental contract will be permitted to charge more than 20 percent per square meter above the neighborhoods median rent, which will be assessed annually by a "local rent observatory." Existing rental contracts that overstep that limit will have to be brought down when they are renewed.

None of this rules out the possibility of rent increases. If all landlords set their rents at the highest legal level, then the median will surely push up year on year. But it should slow the process down and ensure enough regularity throughout neighborhoods for prospective tenants to feel confident that theyre not getting ripped off.

Landlords are also getting some benefits, too. Theyll get a cap (albeit at a not inconsiderable 18 percent) on the tax they pay on rental earnings if their property is in an area of shortage. More significantly, both tenants and landlords will pay into a government run insurance fund against unpaid rent. If a tenant defaults, landlords will no longer have to chase them through the courts, but simply apply to the fund for reimbursement.

http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2013/07/new-rent-laws-aim-keep-paris-becoming-only-rich/6187/


The law seeks to cap rent increases from one lease to the next in the countrys largest cities as part of a sweeping housing reform, known in France by the acronym ALUR.

Rent in Paris has soared by 42 percent in the last 10 years, according to official data.

An OpinionWay poll published in June showed that 75 percent of French people supported the price-capping measure, although it has met with harsh criticism from estate agents and landlords.

http://www.france24.com/en/20150801-rent-control-law-paris-france-effect-regulations



Barely a month after the German capital introduced a new set of rules that limits rent increases within a given area, figures collected by ImmobilienScout24 show that the average cost of new Berlin rental contracts has dropped 3.1 percent within a month. This cant be written off as an example of a general countrywide downward trend. In other German cities where such laws havent yet been introduced, rents have remained more or less static. This is good news for the legislators of Berlins Senate as their new law is doing exactly what they promised the electorate that it would.

The new law introduced on June 1stcalled the mietpreisbremse or rental price brake in Germanworks like this. An overseeing body fixes a standard median rent per square meter for each city district, using figures based a biennial state census of rents. No new rental contract within the district is then permitted to charge over 10 percent more than this amount. This still means that price increases for new rentals are possible, but if they come, they happen far more slowly.

<TEXT> I tend to get muddled with book and show. Has Melisandres visions included White Walkers/Undead? Do we know if she can tell the difference between people fighting and the Undead fighting. 

It was mentioned she was sure to have seen Jon fighting in Winterfell and she claimed more about Stannis in her visions. 

Given all the latest (and upcoming book wise) battles is there a chance she instead saw the raised dead of the White Walker horde fighting as they ravage the north and has misinterpreted what her visions are actually showing/warning her. So instead of preventing the darkness, she helped it gain an army.   </TEXT>

But any word of if visas will be needed, will people have to leave, or if there will be any new immigration guidelines to follow for businesses/migrants? And how long for this to be implemented if people vote to leave? 

Been searching for information, but seems vague at the moment. Know number of people working here and seems to be the main concern on what will happen to them. 

Not trying to be on either side with this question, want to know about outcomes and how people can prepare for it. </TEXT>

So like never upgrading tools, Play Linus mode and only sell foraged or found items, Monster hunter (so farming goes towards food for mining boosts), Passive miner so you cannot fight back against mobs etc 

Some of these might limit what quests you can do but would it create a new challenge? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm someone who is failing miserably with fishing. So does anyone have any tips and tricks to improve? Or what to do when there are chests?

Personally I fail a lot when the fish suddenly switches direction. So it floats around one place (until green bar is near the top) and then suddenly sinks/rises to another spot and moves up and down a lot more. As I chase the fish with clicks/no clicks the bar goes to red and I fail. 

What's the best tactic to chase the fish with the sudden movement without losing too much of the green progress bar?

Is it just matter of collecting the junk until I can add upgrades and level up?

<TEXT> I look at all the things I want to do in game, and all the money I need to raise to get it. At first I panicked at how long that will take me (given my current progress) and then I realized it was the first season and I had ton of in game seasons to pass me by and improve the farm. And I love that. 

Lot of games get tiresome when you work towards things and gain them too quickly, so far feels like I can always have a task to aim for in this game. Bit like how in old WoW how long it took to hussle and grind to save up for a mount and how rewarding it felt to finally get it. But this is more relaxing to play too (even if fishing mini game stresses me out a little). So I will always be able to jump in here and there to try some farming or a dungeon. 

It's sets a good challenge but in a relaxed gameplay way. Sorry for the random gushing, maybe a question....how long has it taken some of you to clear the farm land?

<TITLE> Government response to petition on Reverse the decision to allowing fracking under our national parks.. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-12 11:34:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Think post to sign it was posted here, so the response for the curious on any outcomes:

Our regulations introduce an extra layer of protection, adding to existing protections. They define sensitive areas in which operators cannot frack by prohibiting fracking above 1,200 metres in them.

The Government supports the development of domestic energy sources in a safe and sustainable manner. Gas  the cleanest fossil fuel  still meets a third of our energy demand and we will need it for many years to come. We believe shale gas may hold huge potential for adding to the UKs energy sources, helping to improve energy security, create jobs and meet our carbon targets.

The Government has been clear that shale development must be safe and environmentally sound, maintaining the very highest safety and environmental standards, which we have established as world leaders in extracting oil and gas over decades. The Infrastructure Act 2015, which received Royal Assent in February 2015, introduced a range of requirements if an operator is to carry out hydraulic fracturing, to provide the public with confidence that this industry is being taken forward in a balanced way. These include the assessment of environmental impacts, groundwater monitoring, community benefits and the exclusion of protected areas. 

The protected areas in which hydraulic fracturing will be prohibited have been set out through the Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing (Protected Areas) Regulations, which were formally approved by both Houses of Parliament in December 2015. These regulations ensure that the process of hydraulic fracturing cannot take place above 1200 metres in National Parks, the Broads, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), World Heritage Sites and areas that are most vulnerable to groundwater pollution.

Rather than enabling operations in protected areas, these regulations introduce an additional protection to our most sensitive areas and complement the strong protections already provided by the planning system. Moreover, it is worth emphasising that the regulations do not in themselves grant any form of permission for associated hydraulic fracturing to take place under any of these sites. They simply establish the principle that hydraulic fracturing should be prohibited by legislation in the specified areas and down to the specified depth. A company looking to develop shale will still need to obtain all the necessary permissions, like planning and environmental permits - and any proposals will necessarily be subject to further detailed consideration and scrutiny under our legal and regulatory regimes.

Separately, the Government has also committed to ensure that hydraulic fracturing cannot be conducted from wells that are drilled at the surface of the UKs most valuable areas in a way that is not intended to impact on conventional drilling operations. We have formally consulted with industry and other interested parties on how best to implement this commitment and will issue a response to our consultation once we have reviewed their responses. 

The UK has one of the best track records in the world when it comes to protecting our environment while also developing our industries  and we have brought that experience to bear on the shale gas protections. The shale industry will be developed safely with world class environmental protections, creating jobs and delivering better energy security while safeguarding of some of our most precious areas.

<DATE> 2016-01-28 13:07:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Part help and rant. I've dealt with stomach and odd heart bump when I go aah internally. But over last two weeks I've had the breathlessness. Doctors checked my lungs and it is not the horrible health issues i feared all week (which is tiny relief). Luckily doctor suggested/form me for an x-ray later so double relief if that comes through clean. I'm fighting thoughts of 'what if she's wrong'

The breathing exercises just remind me of that feeling in my chest.  So harder to shake than the others. I think the trigger is everything work, life, health. Been sick a lot over Christmas and news had too many health fear stories (even headlines make me worry). Currently trying to drink all the herbal tea in the office

Any tips on sorting breathing stress or avoiding the health fear triggers? 

I'm signing up for counselling but doctor and my bf suggested i should tell work. Urgh i fear my boss would treat me different and things which cheer me up/good challenge at work (like projects and trips) will be lost to me.   </TEXT>

Here's a snippet:

* You can get on a bus and end up in Paris

* Everyone knows more about our history then we do
 
* Radio is still a big deal. The BBC is quite good

* The newspapers can be awful 

* Everything costs the same but our money is worth less so you have to add 50% to the price to figure what you're paying

* Beer comes in large, completely filled, actual pint glasses and the closer the brewery the better the beer
 
* Butter and eggs aren't refrigerated
 
* The beer isn't warm, each style is served at the proper temperature 

* Cider (alcoholic) is quite good.

* Excess cider consumption can be very painful.
 
* The universal greeting is "Cheers" (pronounced "cheeahz" unless you are from Cornwall, then it's "chairz")
 
* The money is easy to understand: 1-2-5-10-20-50 pence, then-1-2-5-10, etc bills. There are no quarters. 
 
* Their cash makes ours look like Monopoly money
 
* Cars don't have bumper stickers

* Many doorknobs, buildings and tools are older than America

<TEXT> Often seen it argued that men have less of a support network when it comes to emotional matters, there's a 'man up' attitude rather than seeking help and support from people they know. Often argued why suicide rate is higher due to shame and pressure of masculinity and not being able to reach out. 

Sometimes when you meet someone who's acting up in a bad way, turns out they're dealing with issues relating to a bad break up or relationship, social problems by themselves. 

So are there any healthy and not get bitter support, books, blogs, sites, etc which aim to help guys with these issues?

<TEXT> from wiki it's looks like we've taken in around and more than 20,000 in the past and coped.

Was the reaction the same from social and government level? 


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom
Following the end of World War II, substantial groups of people from Soviet-controlled territories settled in Britain, particularly Poles and Ukrainians. The UK recruited displaced people as so-called European Volunteer Workers in order to provide labour to industries that were required in order to aid economic recovery after the war.[22] In the 1951 census, the Polish-born population of the UK numbered some 162,339, up from 44,642 in 1931.[23][24]

 The flow of Indian immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by Idi Amin's sudden decision to expel all 50,000 Gujarati Indians from Uganda. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians migrated to the UK.[25]

There was also an influx of refugees from Hungary, following the crushing of the 1956 Hungarian revolution, numbering 20,990.[26]

How many people we've taken in so far according to guardian 

Only 200 have been taken by Britain so far under this scheme, although the government has given asylum or other forms of humanitarian protection to nearly 5,000 Syrians who have applied for asylum having reached Britain since the crisis started in early 2011 </TEXT>
