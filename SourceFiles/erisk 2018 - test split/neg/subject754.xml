<TEXT> True, it just raises a flag for me. It could be nothing, but it could be that the prior owner added some not-quite-up-to-code circuits. It's just something that I look for. I caught two mis-wired outlets at my house this way. 

Exposed J-boxes or wiring in the garage or attic can also be an indication of how the place was wired. Most of the times it's fine, sometimes it's not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One minor thing that might be a red flag is the screws for the electrical outlet and switch covers. If a homeowner or a rushed contractor put them in, chances are that they just [tightened the screws until they held](http://diedrikbuilders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/worn-out-screws@05x.jpg). A craftsman will align the screws [vertically or horizontally](http://diedrikbuilders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/job-done@025x.jpg). It's far from a dealbreaker, but it can be an indication of rushed/ unknowledgeable home wiring. Tread especially lightly if some covers have mismatched screws that have been cobbled together </TEXT>

<TEXT> I too had a lacing issue, and I had to send my boots back (and pay for the $30 shipping to do so). The knots holding the base of the laces aren't tied well and can come undone, which can lead to you ripping out the entire lace which you can't re-thread yourself. When that happens, just hope you're not in the backcountry and can limp down the mountain with undone boots. 

The very first time I tightened my second brand new boot after getting a new set mailed to me, a knot came undone and I lost the pullcord handle. Ridiculous. 

Another gripe I have is that the cinches on the sides of the boot come undone all the time. It seems that they've added some protection around them in the newer models, but it's frustrating to have to constantly be re-tightening your boots.

The idea of the boot is great, the execution is terrible in my opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish I did, but I do have quite a few harpoons for it. My grandfather (born in 1895) owned the rifle, and judging from the rifle's condition I'd be surprised if he didn't hold on to the box for most of the time. Unfortunately in the past 20 years or so since he passed away I haven't found any box or other documentation on it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an almost mint-condition Jarmann M1884 Harpoon rifle. I've got about 15-20 harpoons for it, and it's been in the family for just about its entire life. The serial numbers are stamped on just about every single part, and they all match. 

Only about 30,000 of these rifles were made, and only approximately 1,911 were converted into harpoon rifles.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmann_harpoon_rifle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmann_M1884 

It's a beautiful rifle with a silky smooth action which is also capable of firing the 10.15x61R cartridge (assuming you can find one). 

The blank harpoon rounds I have use a fire-formed .348 Winchester case (again, very hard to find), and are filled with unknown powder and sealed with wax. Manufacture circa 1970. 

I don't have any packaging, but it's in surprisingly good condition for being actively used in the ~1940-1970s and earlier as a harpoon gun to catch seals and other harpoonable sea animals </TEXT>

<TEXT> My apartment sits right next to the community pool. Once it's summertime and the pool is open and the college kids are out of school it's nonstop drinking, yelling, and splashing until 2am at least a few nights a week. I don't mind much on Fridays or Saturdays because those are nights to cut loose and have a good time, but god help you if you wake me during my precious Tuesday night slumber. 

The problem is that getting up and yelling out the window, while effective, wakes me up even further. I have a hard time sleeping, so all I wanted to do was press a button and have the problem go away. 

So after a bit of research I bought a wireless relay, some nichrome wire, a bit of conduit, and scrounged around for some wires and an old cell phone power supply. Finally, I acquired some bottle rockets. 

After a little bit of building, I now have a 4 shot remote controlled bottle rocket launcher. It's marvelous. 

When people start getting rowdy I just have to groggily reach over for my remote, hit a little button, and a bottle rocket gets launched from my balcony over the pool. The loud noise generally snaps the partiers out of their drunken stupor long enough for them to realize that it's late, they're drunk, and they should quiet down. Either that or my neighbors think that the partiers are setting off fireworks at night and they get up to yell. Being a selfish bastard I don't mind either way, as long as I get my sleep. 

**TL;DR I made a remote controlled bottle rocket launcher for $20 and spare parts so I can get my beauty sleep**

<TEXT> I agree with your thought of taking a semester or two to see what you like. Once you get into the general classes and start seeing some of what the more advanced classes will hold it will be much easier to see what really interests you. Almost all colleges have general classes for the first year so it's easy to change majors if you find that one class in particular is interesting to you.  

As for consulting, that's exactly what I do. I've designed natural gas pipelines, programmed controllers for 4000+hp compressors, and made entire pumping stations work. I personally love consulting because of the variety of jobs. I'm constantly working on new things which I really enjoy. You're not stuck designing a single button for an F-16 for two years straight like you would in aerospace. So you don't need a petro degree to get into the petroleum side of consulting, although if you take a handful of classes and absolutely love the geology and fluids aspect of it, then by all means go for it. 

If you do choose petroleum engineering just know that you will likely be working in petroleum the rest of your life and it has a very boom/bust cycle. One week you're making ridiculous money with housing and food provided, then the next you're out of a job with literally no other jobs available in the entire industry. Also, get to like either Houston or (if you're in the field) the middle of bumfucknowhere in North Dakota, Montana, South Texas, Bakersfield, or the gulf. North gets you -20F days, and south gets you +120F days.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's similar with Mechanical Engineers. It's extremely easy for a Mech E to get into petroleum, but very hard for a Petro to get into Mechanical Engineering. I'm currently a mechanical engineer doing pipeline and station design, so not quite pure petroleum engineering, but I had two job offers from different oilfield service companies within the week I graduated college. 

What gneiss_k and I are saying is that a petroleum engineering degree is highly specialized in that you can easily get jobs in only one field. Currently most petroleum companies are laying off thousands upon thousands of workers so you may be competing for jobs against people with years of experience once you graduate with zero experience. 

With a more general degree like chemical or mechanical engineering, you can easily change from petroleum to any other field like refinery design, pipeline design, or even pharmaceuticals or aerospace if you find petroleum isn't your thing (or if there are no jobs available as is the case now).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's really easy to do as long as you're patient and measure twice. Don't rush your cuts and it'll turn out well. I've been using my DIY board for about 4 years now and it's still working great. 

Just look up some youtube videos (there are several good ones), measure twice, measure again, and cut and drill to your heart's content. Super easy and it'll save you mucho dinero over a pre-manufactured board.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Designing and building a trophy truck for the Baja 1000, building a CNC plasma cutter, and building a turbojet engine, etc. all are on my plate at the moment. The first two projects are about 30-50% complete.

Money is a finite resource however, so these projects are moving along more slowly than anticipated. 

I've made a bamboo and carbon fiber bike, a tallbike with arduino controlled shifting, and a large cargo carrying bike, along with several welded art pieces and other random small jobs in the last year and a half though. My friends and I enjoy making ridiculous designs for projects, and every once in awhile a few of them find either personal or external funding. 

Whenever my day job starts getting monotonous I find myself designing something new, so I'm always thinking.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's no way you can shut down a major gas pipeline when many thousands of customers (or more) depend on uninterrupted gas service from that line. If gas flow is interrupted to your house and your pilot lights go out, once the gas is returned you basically have several small gas leaks that could end up blowing up your entire house if not dealt with properly. Multiply this by a city of a hundred thousand and you can see why shutting down a gas main isn't an option. Not to mention power plants, industrial boilers, etc. all need uninterrupted high pressure gas to operate. 

[Hot taps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_tapping), stopples, bypasses, etc. are an everyday occurrence in the gas industry. 

Here's a nifty little video on the basics of how in-service lines are bypassed in the field if you're interested.

<TEXT> I have an insulated camelbak and pack which has a sleeve for a hydration line, and it'll still freeze up if you're not extremely careful to blow out all the water when you're done sipping. But then again I generally ride backcountry and it can get pretty cold. A zero degree day is still warm for me. 

When I'm riding backcountry I generally just bring a 1.5L Nalgene bottle which is plenty for a day of skinning and snowboarding. The additional volume is nice because it takes longer to freeze, and I can throw it in the center of my pack where I generally stash an extra layer which provides some additional insulation. 

At the resorts though, I don't wear any pack and just drink some water before I head out in the morning. I usually make some tea at lunch as well which helps with hydration.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As long as you're reasonably competent at drilling holes and aligning measurements, making your own splitboard is very easy. If you have access to a drill press and a circular saw then go for it!

Honestly, I was a bit disappointed at how easy making my own splitboard was. I made it over the course of 1 week, and the most time consuming part was waiting for the epoxy to dry on the T-nuts and inside edges. I like a challenge, and this was surprisingly easy. I've had my homebrew splitboard for about 3 years now, and it's carried me to some [intense couloirs and chutes](http://imgur.com/a/AV2b2) without any problems at all. 

Would a manufactured splitboard be nicer than mine? Yes. Would it be 5x the cost of mine? Definitely. 

There are a ton of helpful tutorials on youtube, so before you make your decision watch a few and decide whether or not you think you can build one. If you're confident in your abilities and want to save some money, then definitely make your own. If you've never used a drill press before, then maybe spend the dough to buy a new one. 

In the end, it's up to you. If you have the extra cash for a new splitboard (and shovel, beacon, probe, skins, poles, pack, avy safety course, etc.), then by all means get one. They're nice. But if you're like me 3 years ago, the savings from building my own board allowed me to buy all the safety gear and an avalanche safety course for about the same price as a new splitboard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to a 3-gun competition this weekend, and these are what I brought. The bottom three are my competition guns, and the top three are my backup guns, in case something breaks or malfunctions. 

Bottom guns (used in competition):

* Remington 870 with 10+1 capacity
* AR-15 with muzzle brake (machined by yours truly) 
* Glock 34 with grip stippling

Top guns (backup):

* Winchester 1300 Defender with Blackhawk recoil reducing stock
* Mini-14
* Glock 27

I did very well in the competition for my standards. I got 7th overall out of 38 participants. In attendance was Craig Calkins who took 2nd at the World 3-gun competition last weekend, along with several others who were at the World competition. 


Needless to say, I was pretty darn happy with how I shot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's certainly a fun time up there. Lots of big lines. Just be real careful about snow conditions. 

For instance, we dropped in a 11am, and I wouldn't have dropped any later than 11:30. Things can get melty fast this time of year. Also during the early season weak layers can cause the whole thing to slide. Falling in the chutes would be a pretty quick way to get dead even if you don't get buried.  </TEXT>

The only upside to boot packing is that you don't have to downclimb/rappel if there isn't enough snow up top.  </TEXT>

I'll post up an album of the trip tomorrow. Edit: [here's a few photos of the couloir I took](http://imgur.com/a/qu2Al)

It's about 1600 vertical feet of 45-50 degree slope. Luckily there was enough snow up top that we didn't need to rappel the first bit, although we had harnesses and rope for it if need be. 

Burly lines on a beautiful day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is great advice, and it's how I got my current job. I got a job offer for an acceptable, but not great, job opening at another company. The company I currently work for informed me that they would like to interview me, and I told them that I would love to work for them, but that I also had a pressing decision to make. 

They took that into consideration and had me interview with 5-6 people at the office (normal is 2-3 rounds of interviews seeing 1-2 people each time). I walked in at 8am for an interview and walked out at 11am with a job offer in hand. 

If you've impressed them enough to get an interview then you know they're interested in you. Hiring people is a pain in the ass, so if they know they have a highly motivated candidate they're more likely to bend some normal hiring rules to get you in. Just don't be pushy or demanding, and show that you're interested.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sit right down and I'll tell you a tale of the internet. Back in my day the internet was a wild frontier of piracy, lewd photos, and cat pictures. Trolls ran rampant and anonymity was the brazen shield that every user believed in. I've seen millions of dollars made and lost in the blink of an eye, I've seen massive attacks on public domains, and I've seen some of the most disturbing things you can see. Now son, now things are different... the internet has been rounded up, broken, and saddled. The wild, carefree days of casual surfing are gone. All that remains is the institutionalized mess we have now. Sure it works, and it works efficiently some of the time, but the days of posting on questionable forums, the nights of raiding, and the thrill of the unknown is gone. Dead and gone...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get an internship, and work on projects for fun *and document them*. I like to mountain bike and snowboard (among other things), so I've built several mountain bikes, built a splitboard in my spare time, fixed engines, etc. and I took pictures of all the cool things I made, even if the project didn't seem all that hard to me. This shows you have real hands-on skills. A surprisingly high amount of people who go to college for engineering have never worked on anything before and can't hardly tell a nut from a bolt. 

The way I got my current job is by making a 1 page photo addition to my 1 page resume. I threw on photos of a trophy truck frame I'm building, pictures of a bamboo and carbon fiber bike I made, some SolidWorks screenshots of things I've modeled, and a few other things. This gives the interviewer something to talk with you about, and you can describe how you built the project and how some of those same skills apply to the job you're looking to get hired for. 

Also, software skills are important. Lots of companies look for someone who has experience with SolidWorks, Pro/E, AutoCAD, etc. And if you have experience with one type of modeling software then your skills can generally transfer over to another software suite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was drunk at 2am walking alone through a bad part of town a few weeks ago. A large group of black guys all walked up on me and asked me if I could give them some directions, even though it was fairly obvious they weren't lost. I stumbled through the middle of them and mumbled something about getting home and just kept on walking. 

I had to walk home 10 miles that night (I fucked up and missed the last bus home), and until mile 9 I didn't really realize the many possible bad outcomes of that encounter. Maybe they were genuinely lost. Or maybe I walked straight through a mugging/scam. Cities be scary.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't get one until senior year, and the thing that sealed the deal was that I liked to do extracurricular activities (specifically build road and mountain bike frames). Grades are important, but you need to distinguish yourself somehow because there will always be upperclassmen competing for the same job. 

And no, pay generally isn't enough to pay for school, however it can help out quite a bit if you get a good one. Most internships pay in the neighborhood of $12 to $20 an hour, but petroleum jobs can make upwards of $25, and I've heard of up to $40 per hour (those are really competitive though).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just graduated from Mines this December in Mechanical Engineering, but I know several Petroleum folks and I got job offers from 2 Oil   Gas companies as well as interviewing with a few others. 

The school is much harder than many other schools so you'll come out very well prepared (and employers know this, even as a MechE many companies were interested in me, despite me knowing nearly nothing about oil). Don't expect to be partying all the time, although the Petroleum department is notorious for having a more rowdy crowd than the rest of the school. 

Also, if you like the outdoors you'll have a fantastic time.

Overall, if you like to work hard and play hard you'll love it at mines. And you'll love the starting paycheck at the end of the 4 or 5 years it takes you.

Edit: Get an internship early if you can because they can be both very lucrative and can open up a bunch of other opportunities. For example, my former roommate had a summer internship that paid more than I'm making right now as a fulltime employee. Now he's making right around 100k a year, right out of college.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the main reasons this happens is because they're likely very sad that you turned them down. In their eyes you're a great match, someone they could see themselves with for a long time, but you don't see it that way. You've just relegated your relationship with him to casual conversations and group events, nothing more. 

Speaking from experience, it's very hard to see someone often who has turned you down. It's hard to be reminded everyday that your feelings are completely unrequited. Because of this some people will choose to just move on to keep from feeling hurt, and although it makes you sad you've lost an acquaintance it's much more sad for them because they've lost a potential soul mate. 

TL;DR: It's uncomfortable for everyone involved

<TEXT> The Mini-14 is less accurate (as a target shooter I was getting approx 2 MOA with mine, as opposed to .75-.50 MOA with my home-built AR), but GOD DAMN is it reliable. I inherited mine from my uncle, and it had about 2000 rounds through it with zero malfunctions before it got a cleaning. For that reason alone I'm never going to sell it. 

The AR platform is more picky, but you can built it any way you want to. Want a super cheap lead slinger? Bingo, spend $600, build it yourself and you're done. Want a 1000 yard target rifle? Take some time, pick your components, and build it over a year or two and tune it (and your ammo) to what works best for you. 

The Mini-14 is more of a one trick pony. It'll give you undefeatable reliability and 2 MOA accuracy all day, every day of its life. It's a simple rifle, so if you want to run fancy EOTech optics, 60 round mags, and a 1 point sling like the Operator you are, then look towards the AR. But if you want a simple, easy to use rifle that will *never* let you down, look long and hard at the Mini-14 platform.

<TEXT>  On my second Saiga-12, I had a trigger spring failure after less than 100 rounds, where the hammer spring that resets the trigger after each shot became dislodged (This may have been from firing only full-power loads on a custom adjustable gas plug which had yet to be configured correctly). I had to push the trigger forward manually to fire another round until I broke the gun down and replaced the spring with an aftermarket model that had tighter tolerance and was intended for competition guns. No problems since then.
 

I had the exact same problem with my Saiga. I only shot birdshot out of it, so it must be a slightly faulty design. Pain in the ass to work around when you're in a competition. 

Mine also wouldn't reliably cycle (with birdshot) if there was any hint of dust in the area. I went to a dry, dusty, and windy 3 gun competition and couldn't get more than 3 consecutive shots all day without a failure to feed, eject, etc. Granted, I hadn't polished and honed any of the internal surfaces, but you shouldn't need to do a ton of work in order for a gun to function properly out of the box.

I sold the Saiga for more than I bought it for, went back to my trusty 870, and I've never looked back since. I like the idea of a Saiga, but not the execution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How did you get into building the truck for the baja 1000?

Well I was into modifying jeeps and things and was part of my school's informal racing club. A few friends had also been on the SAE mini baja team, and since they did well at competition they wanted to design the real deal. I knew a decent amount about rear-end suspension design from working on Jeeps, so when they asked if I wanted to help out I jumped at the opportunity. It's just me and three others with no involvement from the school. 

What fields are you getting job offers from?

I got 2 job offers from oil and gas, 1 from a CAD software company, and two from mechanical-specific companies (I got the job offer today woohoo!).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just graduated in December from a very good engineering college with a decent GPA (3.26). For the month after graduation I didn't really hear anything from employers which was a bit unnerving. In the last month though I have gotten 4 job offers and have an interview tomorrow that will hopefully increase that number. It's a lot of work, but if you apply many places and have some good experience on your resume you won't have a problem. 

Pro tip: experience doesn't have to be an internship. It definitely helps to have 1 or 2, but it's not a dealbreaker if you don't have one every single summer. Get some hands-on experience (almost nobody straight out of school has real hands on building experience). For instance, I'm helping design and build a full size race truck for the Baja 1000. That project alone has gotten me a huge amount of interest from employers, even more so than my 1 internship. 

1 thing: some companies are very picky about having a 3.0 GPA. I know of a wonderful person who let her grades slip because she was taking 20 credit hours. Despite the fact that she has a security clearance, lots of experience, and a good personality most of the aerospace companies won't even look at her resume. Just keep up the good work, apply everywhere, and something will come along.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely agree. When somebody is in that mindset of wanting to end it all, they don't really care how it's done. The reason there are so many gun-related suicides is because it's just a convenient option. If guns are outlawed due to suicides, then knife, hanging, and drug suicide rates will rise. 

If somebody has made the choice to end it all, they're going to find a way to do it. We need to focus on helping them, and not on banning the method they use to commit suicide.  </TEXT>

I was an officer in the Colorado School of Mines shooting sports club until I graduated. Our club would take freshman dorm floors to an outdoor shooting range, teach them the fundamentals of safe shooting, and provide various firearms for them to try as we watched. It was a ton of fun, and over the years many of the freshmen joined our club after going on an outing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went trap shooting with another redditor last weekend. We hit the range at around 10:30, shot 3 rounds apiece, and headed out. She hadn't shot trap before, but had been bird hunting several times. I was surprised at her good stance, and she was hitting more than she missed despite it being her first time. After we were done, I walked with her down to the skeet and sporting clay ranges and explained the differences between the 3 sports. 

Then, as we were leaving the range I accidentally drove off with the electronic scorecard that keeps track of how much you shoot. I called them later that day and mailed it back to them with a check for $20 and an apology letter. I still feel stupid about it, but I'm glad I didn't lose their scorecard system. 

Overall it was a good day. 20 degree temps and overcast, just us two on the range, and plenty of fun was had.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A slightly more manly stance means a *drastic* decrease in accuracy. For standing you want your elbow bone resting on your hip bone so as little weight as possible is supported by muscle. That way you don't tire and start to shake. 

[This photo has a good description of proper stance](http://frostedbutts.com/TTAG/15/8.jpg)

Just imagine holding [this tactical stance](http://www.everycitizenasoldier.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/positions/S_ModOff.jpg) for 75 minutes straight (not including any finals or tiebreakers). By the end of 10 mins your abs would be burning, your arms would be tired, and your bent knees would be a shaking wreck. At 50m you'd be lucky to even hit the paper after 75 mins of a tactical stance, whereas many olympians have gotten perfect scores by hitting the tiny 10.4 mm center ring (the bullseye is only .5mm (.02 inches) for 10m air rifle (posted above), or about the size of a 12 pt. period).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I drive an '03 Legacy with a manual transmission (which is basically the same as an '03 outback). I get about 23mpg city and 30ish highway. Most new Subaru models will offer about the same (or better) gas mileage since they have the same engine as I have (2.5L naturally aspirated engine). My normal mileage (about 50/50 city   highway) is 24-26 mpg so it's not too bad, but not the absolute best either. 

In the snow however, it's fantastic. I like to drive a bit fast so the AWD is awesome, it's very controllable in slick conditions like gravel or snow. You want to drift? Great. Just hit the gas, spin the tires a bit, then bump the steering straight when you want to stop sliding. Don't want to slip at all? Just point the steering wheel where you want to go and that's where you'll go. 

From 2004? to 2012 the Legacy models had a turbo factory installed, but in 2013 they discontinued this feature and therefore dropped the horsepower but increased the gas mileage. The Outbacks have changed as well. The newer models have become more boxier and SUV-like than older hatchback-style models which is a bit disappointing to me, but many people like the increased cargo space the Outbacks offer. 

The WRX and STI models are fast as all getout, but they're looking to revamp the model in 2015, so if you're looking for a hot hatchback then I might wait until the new model comes out so you can decide if you want the old style or the new style. They're fast, and therefore give up a bit of gas mileage, but damn they're fun to drive. 

The Forester and their other bigger models are alright, but they keep the same 2.5 liter engine every other model has, so they tend to be slower than the rest, although you get more cargo space. The newer models that run the 2.0 L engine (like the Impreza, Crosstrek, etc.) are generally underpowered (in my opinion) and I wouldn't advise buying one. I tend to slow down on the steep mountain hills with my 2.5L displacement engine, so I can't imagine what a half liter loss would do to its performance. 

Finally, I love that Subaru offers manual transmissions in most of their lineup. If you can't drive manual or prefer not dealing with the hassle of a clutch pedal that's fine, but the control you get with AWD and a manual transmission is unparalleled. You can easily slow down, speed up, and control yourself in the worst of conditions with a manual. 

I'm also currently looking for a new car, and the two I've settled on (based on by budget) are the Outback and the WRX (both manual transmission). I like the WRX in that it's fast as shit for such a cheap car (4.7 sec 0-60mph), and I like that I can sleep in the back of the Outback in addition to hauling a bunch of gear, and it can tow up to 3,000 lbs with a towing package installed. 

The choice is up to you, but based on my experiences I'd definitely recommend the Legacy, Outback, and Impreza WRX and STI models. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Arborwear pants and shirts are fairly nice, but I wouldn't call any piece of clothing BIFL. All clothes wear out, it's just a matter of when. From my experiences when you're doing heavy work especially around sharp pieces, pointy rocks, etc. Arborwear tends to wear out pretty fast. If you're doing easier things like painting or garden work or welding they're great, but for hard work like trailbuilding they tend to go by relatively quick. 

I prefer Carhartt pants and jackets for their resistance to wear, but I *love* Arborwear design. Their pockets and little knife/tool sleeve in the pants and shorts is just great. So if you're working relatively light and need something a bit sturdier than jeans, get Arborwear. If you're doing hard work all the time in abrasive conditions, get Carhartt. I haven't tried the [Firehose](http://www.duluthtrading.com/store/mens/duluth-ingenuity/fire-hose-workwear/mens-fire-hose-pants/mens-fire-hose-pants.aspx) pant by Duluth Trading Co yet, but I've heard good things about it as well.

<TEXT> I was in an unfamiliar shop working on my car, and needed to quickly find a tool. I walk up to their tool cabinets and [something akin to this](http://bangshift.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/shop1.jpg) is what I found. 

Good lord holy jesus, I was just looking for a 3/8" drive ratchet and it took me nearly 20 minutes to sift through all the crap. And a 9/16" socket to use with the ratchet? Forget about it. No organization at all, and the fact that I was on a deadline made it that much worse. I had debated bringing my nicely organized toolbox to this shop just in case, but I decided not to. After the fifth time picking up a 7/16" socket with hope in my eyes I nearly just threw my tools on the ground and left. 

Organize your damn tools people! Even if it's a community shop there is no reason why things shouldn't be labeled and preferably [shadowboxed](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/5S_Tools_drawer.jpg). It's not OK to just have drawers and drawers of randomly assorted tools, nuts, washers, picks, and O rings. 

**TL;DR [Shadowboxing](http://www.cribmaster.com/images/AccuDrawer_Drawer_4.jpg), labeling, and 5S 4 lyf!** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just remember, you NEVER want to buy footwear based on looks alone. Yeah, you'll look all cool and fancy stomping through puddles and kicking logs, but if they don't fit you'll have blisters within hours. On a several day backpacking trip, this will mean unending misery for you and frustration from your hiking buddies. I've admittedly got a kind of weird looking pair of boots, but DAMN they feel good. I can hike for 20 miles with a full pack and my feet will still be just fine at the end of the day. 

Go try them on, and not just Vasque shoes either. Spend quite a bit of time with a shoe salesman who knows his stuff. Ask questions. Make sure you really feel them out when you try them on (don't just put them on, walk 2 feet, then buy them). Vasques tend to run a bit more wide than other shoes, so if you've got skinny little feet like me you'll be hating life very quickly. 

That said, Vasque shoes are very well made. No shoe or boot is BIFL, but these will hold up better than many.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so most snowboarders can't ride moguls. It certainly takes a bunch of practice, but it can be done. You just have to have the will to practice something uncomfortable and not regress to doing something easy like riding the park. I almost exclusively ride with advanced-level skiers, so warming up on a mogul run then moving over to double black chutes is a normal day for me. 

The first thing you have to realize is that your front foot is your pivot, and your rear foot is your "rudder' so to speak. Weight your front foot more than the back foot and swing your rear foot around your front. Practice this on flat ground, it might feel a bit funny, but you want to do 90% of your turning with your back foot. It's your control foot. 

To really nail this down, I spent alot of time in thick trees where not being able to turn quickly meant you crashed hard into a tree. It really gives you motivation to learn proper quick turning techniques. Start slow, incredibly slow, and make sure you brake before hitting any trees. Learn to control your speed. Go quicker and quicker through the trees until you don't crash (as much).

Next, you need to learn to read lines through moguls. Believe it or not, each mogul run isn't comprised of uniform bumps. Some of them are cut out into nice turns (which you should ride), and some are horribly undercut (which you shouldn't ride). If you get onto a bad line, you end up riding down lefthand turns when you should be turning right, and vice versa. This situation isn't fun.

To start out, traverse the slope 4-5 moguls at a time and look for a nice sweeping turn cut into the mogul, not a steep dropoff at the front face of the mogul in front of you. Practice practice practice. Find the easiest route down and practice your font-leg pivot. 

Once you get good at this, narrow your turns down to 2-3 moguls each. Make sure you only take lines with nice, sweeping turns. Practice finding good lines through the mogul fields. 

After 1 or 2 seasons of practice, pin it to win it. Slam down the slopes in a single line and ride it all the way down to the bottom. Spot your lines. They constantly change, so look to see where the path of least resistance is. It takes effort, it takes skill, but by the end of all your practice you'll be leaving mediocre skiers in your dust. 

At the age of 10 years old I was just starting to get the hang of moguls on skis, but then I switched to snowboarding. It took about 6 years total to be able to ride moguls well, and now after 13 years of riding, I can honestly say that on most days I'm the best snowboarder on the mountain with regards to moguls and big mountain riding. 

The key is practice. 99% of the time I ride with skiers, so moguls are a big part of the day. Being forced to ride them day in and day out really helped me gain an appreciation to the work and skill that goes into riding moguls, and it gave me an incentive to ride them well. Most snowboarders ride with other boarders, and are content to just trying to spin and grind off of jumps in the terrain park all day. Being able to spin a 720 off a jump is neat and all, but it takes considerable effort to be able to ride real terrain like moguls and steep mogul-and-ice-ridden chutes, and the payoffs are tremendous. Ramming down the steepest slope on the mountain while skiers watch you with awe is one of the best feelings ever.

<TEXT> Most resorts leave the moguls there to make the terrain more interesting. Who likes boring flat groomers all day long? Plus the low-angle mogul runs are great for beginners just starting on moguls. When you get to 35+ degree slopes then you're in the not-possible-to-groom territory and the moguls are 100% natural and unable to be altered. These slopes are for more aggressive skiers and boarders, and probably aren't a good fit for a new learner.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few friends and I were playing around with fireworks one night. They were the kind that explode, then a whole bunch of crackling explosions go off afterward. Well fireworks on the ground are cool and all, but throwing them in the air is awesome. After a handful of these, someone got the great idea that standing directly underneath the exploding fireworks would look super awesome. So I volunteered to be the thrower. I lobbed fireworks high over their heads so they could explode. Well inevitably one of the fuses was a little longer than the other fuses and the firework exploded right around head height in the middle of the group. 

After that we decided to stick to the relatively safe sport of bottle rocket wars.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad has told me that on numerous occasions he and his friends would play "scissorball" in college. Everybody in the room would find suitable cover, the batter would grab a big couch cushion, and the pitcher would lob a pair of scissors towards the batter and seek cover as quickly as possible. The batter would hit the scissors with the couch cushion and run towards a base before the scissors could be found. He said that on several occasions the scissors would stick into the wall and they would have to find a poster or something to cover it up. 

Don't get me wrong, I've done a few crazy sounding things in my life, but nothing as blatantly dangerous as scissorball.  </TEXT>

First, I'd make every wireless network unlocked and able to be accessed by anyone, as well as removing any data caps. Free wifi is great, right? Second, I'd rename every wireless network to either "It's a goat, see?" or "It's Goatse" and ensure that every 5 minutes they switch names.

When labeled "It's a goat, see?" the very cutest baby goat you've ever seen would be displayed prominently as the background of your browser.

And then... 5 minutes later the network would change names and instead of staring deep into the soulful depths of a cute baby goat, you would be drawn into the dark, swirling abyss of Goatse's anus. The only respite from the storm would be a quizzical glance towards his ring finger </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had my camelbak M.U.L.E. for close to 7 years, and it's still holding strong. I bike quite a bit and was doing mountain bike guiding for 2 summers. The design has changed over the years, but it's still a great pack for going on longer rides or where it might rain. Holds up to 3L of water, rain gear, maps, tubes, 1st aid, etc. and can also cinch down real thin when not very full. 

I almost always ride with it and would definitely recommend a pack similar.

<TEXT> My friend and I built a bike frame out of bamboo and carbon fiber and had to cobble together a frame jig ourselves. I've done some TIG welding and once I finish a few more projects I'd like to weld a frame together for myself.

How much did your Anvil frame jig set you back, and how much effort was it to make your own jig (pictured a few times in old photos)? What was the price difference between the two?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm the type of drunk who sits there quietly in front of his computer, drinking and redditing and netflixing and drinking. Usually I'll stay up until 2-3am on a Tuesday night doing exactly this. 

I tend to get depressed when I drink with others, but when I drink alone I go on wonderful adventures looking for new knowledge, making witty (or shitty) comments, and watching Jeremy Clarkson make a fool of himself. 

I honestly prefer drinking by myself.  I'm hanging out with my own best friend doing what I like to do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's the thing. I really like the adjustable ones because you can fiddle with it throughout the day to make it fit better depending on how you're feeling or if you need to throw a hat under there on really cold days. Also when you're in the store you might overlook something small that barely registers as something annoying. But throughout the day that small annoying thing grows until you're miserable with your helmet by the end of the day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Here we go:**

* They're really comfy if you get a good fitting one (don't just buy a snazzy one off the internet, actually walk into a store and try them on). 

* They keep your head warm (or cool if you open up the vents on top).

* If you ride backcountry or trees like I do, they're great for deflecting branches. Not the big ones, but the ones that make you think "dangit, that one kind of hurt". 

* If you're into the whole gopro thing, you can mount a gopro on your helmet. 

* You can get ones with integrated music playing, or get aftermarket earpads that have music players in them.

* They hold your goggles in place (another thing you should be wearing every time. Eye sunburns and eye damage is additive). 

* [It's](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23117389) been [proven](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/helmets_save_lives_of_skiers_and_snowboarders) many [many](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21440468) times [that](http://www.cpsc.gov/PageFiles/108689/skihelm.pdf) helmets [save](http://www.nsaa.org/media/68045/NSAA-Facts-About-Skiing-Snowboarding-Safety-10-1-12.pdf) lives. Just because you don't expect to fall doesn't mean you won't fall. 

Now I can't force you to wear one, but for the safety aspect alone they are worth their weight in gold. Get a good helmet that fits well and you'll never go back. 90% of my helmet usage is in the trees where little branches just bounce off my head without a care. And for big mountain or backcountry riding it's fairly essential, you don't want to knock your head on a rock submerged just a bit beneath the snow. I know with 100% certainty that my life has been saved by a helmet before.

I personally love the [Smith Variant](http://www.backcountry.com/smith-2007-variant-brim-snow-helmet?CMP_SKU=SMI0835 MER=0406 skid=SMI0835-MATGRA-M CMP_ID=PLA_GOc001 mv_pc=r101 mr:trackingCode=F749F9AC-0F6C-E011-9898-0019B9C043EB mr:referralID=NA mr:adType=pla mr:ad=44515981905 mr:keyword= mr:match= mr:filter=62930445465 mkwid=sIJYNEigO_dc|pcrid|44515981905 origin=pla gclid=CLK6i837iroCFcFAMgodAVcA1w) helmet as it's adjustable and has a great venting system. Super comfy, and I hardly notice it's there. But like I said before, don't just hop on the internet and buy the first shiny helmet you see, try them on and get a good one that fits or else you'll end up just throwing it away like your last one. 

**TL;DR** Try on a bunch of helmets, buy one that fits well and is comfy. Spend a little extra to get a nice one. 

**Buy a fucking helmet.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a shotgun from 1905. If you're taking the time to restore an original shotgun like that, you may as well restore everything the way it was. Slapping Duracoat on an old antique like that would be akin to using spraypaint to finish an original [Shelby Cobra](http://www.bornrich.com/wp-content/uploads/s3/images/2009/09/17/shelby-cobra_MTJ2u_65.jpg), or using home watercolors to touch up a Picasso.

Don't get me wrong, I like duracoated firearms but this would be the completely wrong application for it (in my opinion).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, I was hoping that materials engineers wouldn't show up to this post ;)

I simplified my explanations so that most people could better understand what I said. Most of the shots were taken at 20x, but the closer ones were taken at 50x magnification. And I agree that the structure was alloyed, although this isn't my specialty (I'm I Mech. Engineer, so you probably know more than me). 

Since this was almost a year ago I can't quite remember what grit we polished to, but it was more than 1000. 

And yes, my hands did lock up a bit after polishing those samples. It takes quite awhile to get a good sample! </TEXT>

But seriously, if I run into any of you outside of this thread I'll be sure to name drop. Hopefully by then you'll have long forgotten about this thread and you'll just think I'm some creepy person you know who is stalking you online. Maybe I'm that person who sits on the street corner and stares at you every morning. Or maybe I'm that slightly overeager neighbor who gives off pedophilic vibes. Or maybe I'm that cute salacious person you've been dreaming about for the last several weeks. 

Or maybe I'm just an internet stranger who likes calling people by their names to give them pause.  </TEXT>

Both these relatively stupid ideas popped up at the same time and the result was inevitable:

<TEXT> Accidental discharges happen when somebody isn't paying attention and puts their finger on the trigger when they didn't want to. Those are entirely operator error, and almost never have anything to do with the gun itself. 

[Every manufacturer repeatedly drop tests their pistols](http://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/pdfs/firearms/regs/chapter5.pdf). The pistols are dropped from 1 meter onto a concrete slab and from 6 required drop-positions (see page 6 of link for requirements), and any failures are heavily scrutinized and may require rework or scrapping of the entire batch or entire pistol design. 

Firearms manufacturers take safety and reliability very seriously. Firearms don't go off on their own, it's incompetent owners who are the ones causing negligent discharges.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know several people who are extremely passionate about horses. They're big, smelly, and they can kick you to death if you don't treat them with respect. I don't understand their appeal at all, but I would never think about taking a horse away from its loving owner. 

I pretty much only shoot competitively, making neat little holes in a piece of paper some distance away. I enjoy the zen attitude I get from controlling my heartbeat and breathing while holding the rifle steady and gently squeezing the trigger. It's my stress reliever. 

I have guns, others have horses. I don't understand their viewpoint, and several of them don't understand mine, but that's the beauty of having personal choice. Do what you enjoy and don't hold others from the things they enjoy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Derailleur hangers are meant to bend before your derailleur because they are much cheaper than a new derailleur. So yes, if it's been bent in a crash you can try and bend it back to straight. 

If your derailleur hanger is made of steel it can generally be bent back to straight with a [DAG tool](http://www.amazon.com/Park-Tool-Derailleur-Hanger-Alignment/dp/B0028YWHPW/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps srs=2529177011 ie=UTF8 qid=1377571554 sr=8-1-catcorr keywords=park+derailleur+hanger+tool) fairly easily. If it's aluminum, you can bend it back a few degrees, but generally they snap. Aluminum is much more brittle and will strain harden much quicker than steel, so once it's bent, it's usually done. 

If you break a hanger, just buy a new one from your LBS. They range from $5 to $50+ depending on your bike. Most are pretty cheap and are very simple to install. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Check out [Skratch Labs](http://www.skratchlabs.com/). I personally know one of the founders, and they make some fantastic products. Definitely head and shoulders above any other drink I've had. They also have other products, but their drinks are their flagship.

Before I switched over to Skratch, I used Hammer and Clif gels which were alright, but I much prefer having a drink than a gel. Honey Stinger chewies are delicious though. They have some good flavors and if you want to you can just lick and stick them to your handlebars if you don't actually want to stop to eat (I wouldn't recommend that for mountain bikers though, unless dusty chewies are your thing). </TEXT>

<TEXT> 36ers are large and unwieldy, and may the lord forgive you if you pop a tube. 26" would be the largest tire I would ride, but currently I just ride a 20" which is good for both MUni and trials. Since the wheel is small I don't feel the need for a brake, and most of my friends who are big into unicycling don't use them either (I ride with Max Schulze if you've heard of him). 

To answer your other question, I could hop around moderately well at around 3 months in, and I was fairly good at trials at about 1 year of riding. After 3 years I got sponsored (which is surprisingly easy for mountain unicyclists), and the rest is history. Since I started college 4 years ago I've ridden much less, but I still like to hit a trail or two whenever I can </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was planning on killing my cheating no good wife of mine, but I instead chickened out and drank myself into a stupor. It turns out some asshole who was just there to rob my house killed her and her lover that very night and they picked me up for the crime. I tried to plead my innocence, but the evidence wasn't in my favor and I was convicted of double homicide.

The first few days in prison were the hardest, but I made some friends that knew how to acquire certain items from the outside. I had one friend get me a small rock hammer and a gorgeous photo of Rita Hayworth, and I began to dig in secret for years.  In the meantime I managed the prison library and on the side did some tax preparation work for some of the guards. My tax services were very popular, and I was eventually called upon by the warden to help manage the dirty money and bribes coming in from contractors who didn't want to be underbid by the prison's free labor. It was a genius plan, I even created an entirely fabricated persona who controlled all the ill-gotten funds. Over time though, I came to realized the warden was fully aware that I was an innocent man and covered up the evidence that would allow me to be free. For speaking my mind about the matter I was put in solitary for months on end. It was a living hell of isolation and dispair. Something died inside me in there... 

When I finally was released, I told my friend where I would be after I broke out (although I didn't let on that I'd be escaping soon). That night I peeled my poster back and chipped the last few inches through the concrete wall. Luckily there was an extremely loud thunderstorm, so my noises weren't heard. Unluckily for me though, the only way out was through the prison's sewer line. 500 yards. 500 yards of shit I had to crawl through. It was terrible, but I'd crawl for 10,000 yards in a heartbeat just to feel that elation that overcame me when i stepped foot into the cool river running past the prison. 

I cleaned myself up and got myself as far away from the prison as I could. The next day I put on some nice clothes I'd stolen from the warden when I made my escape and made my way to the bank where my fake persona did his business. I cleaned that place out, bought a car, and drove myself down to a beautiful little town in Mexico. But before I finally left, I made sure to mail the details of the Warden's scams and blackmail to all the newspapers around. That motherfucker ended up shooting himself in the head instead of facing his punishment. I just wish I could've been there to see him do it. 

After some time of living in Zihuatanejo, my good friend Red ended up being released on parole and came to visit me! It was the second best feeling I've ever experienced, and we sat around on the beach for hours and talked as only best of friends can. 

So that's my story of false imprisonment, escape, and finally my redemption of Shawshank prison.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds like a detroit locker. Both wheels have to spin at the same speed the diff carrier is, so both wheels have to spin constantly unlike a normal unlocked diff. Sometimes they can be a bit finnickey and I could definitely see it causing a spinout at high speeds

<TEXT> Just remember this simple trick: spin the BB the way the pedals turn normally to loosen the BB, and turn the BB backwards of normal crank rotation to tighten it. 

And if you're worried about cross threading, just thread the BB backward until you hear a 'click' when the thread drops down off of the top of the bike's thread. That way the start (opening where the thread starts) of the BB and the start of the bike are in the same area. Screw it in nice and slow, and take it easy if you feel any resistance. Be sure to clean the bike's threads before reinstalling the BB too, nobody likes a dirty bottom (bracket)! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know I ripped out my ex girlfriend's heart and threw it into a meat grinder. I knew there was something off in my head for a month or two, and it just came bubbling to the surface one night. My only regret was that I hadn't thought about what I was going to say. 

We were skyping and the call went from happy and "how was your day?" to "are you breaking up with me?" in the matter of 20 minutes. We met up in a parking lot, I fumbled around with unrehearsed words that made her cry, and then I left. 

There wasn't any specific big reason, just a lot of little things that finally add up. Trying to spout off all those reasons will just make you seem like a shallow asshole, but when asked "why are you doing this?", you need to answer with something...

It felt so shitty. She was such a nice person, and I couldn't bear to hurt her, but it was what had to happen. </TEXT>

I like to ride really technical terrain, so I like that they have a wider foot platform on them. You don't need to clip in to get a reasonable amount of grip, so its easy to restart in a rock garden if you get stopped. Just rest your foot on the platform until you have enough time to clip in.

<TEXT> This is the question that everybody has to answer at some point in their lives. It's the worst, most despicable question that could ever be answered, and yet, with a creeping dread, the answer slowly solidifies in the mind like semen under a hot shower. Nothing can purge this thought from the mind, and its owner must live with it for the rest of their lives. 

We have just witnessed the birth of a terrible burden today. May it be a reminder of the abhorrent places the mind can go to when in search of sexual fulfillment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well unless you've owned them continuously since June 1st, you're going to be in trouble. But of course it'll be really hard for a prosecutor to prove that the magazines are postban, which is why several sheriffs have said that they won't be enforcing this law. 

Overall I predict it's going to be a clusterfuck. I don't look forward to explaining that yes, I've had my magazines since the ban, and no I don't feel like being prosecuted. I also don't look forward to making absolutely sure I haven't lost any of my magazines because getting more will involve a 2 hour drive to Wyoming or Kansas or Utah or New Mexico and no online ordering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An erection occurs when two tubular structures, called the corpora cavernosa, that run the length of the penis, become engorged with venous blood. This may result from any of various physiological stimuli, also known as sexual stimulation and sexual arousal. The corpus spongiosum is a single tubular structure located just below the corpora cavernosa, which contains the urethra, through which urine and semen pass during urination and ejaculation respectively. This may also become slightly engorged with blood, but less so than the corpora cavernosa.

To learn more, I suggest reading the [Wikipedia page on Erections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a cop but my friend's father's cousin's mother's best friend's great grandpa once told me that one time this German panzer squad was rolling in heavy and that it was up to my friend's father's cousin's mother's best friend's great grandpa to stop them all. My friend's father's cousin's mother's best friend's great grandpa said that he took the uniform off a German man he'd killed with a shovel, smeared a bit of mud and horse dung on his upper lip to emulate wise old Adolf, then he tromped his way down into the German camp under cover of darkness. 

My friend's father's cousin's mother's best friend's great grandpa said that then he took out his trusty bazooka and located the nearest fuel, ammunition, and beer supply dump. He took steady aim and fired right into the unprotected exhaust port while not even using the targeting computer. He used the force to guide the missile straight in. When the charge hit, the entire German army exploded and fresh cold beer rained down to the American army, thus ending the first cold world anglo-saxon war.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was never illegal to carry on campuses, the campuses just had it in their bylaws that weapons were disallowed and that they would expel you if you brought any. A few people got together and said that since the college campuses were public institutions they weren't allowed to bar legal concealed carriers. The state supreme court upheld this, and as of now we're allowed to carry concealed on college campuses as log as you have a permit. 

This is a different group of people who want to ban concealed carry. The colleges banned it first, the Democrats want to re-ban it now.

<TEXT> **Colorado** 

HB 1224 - 15 round magazine cap   
HB 1226 - no concealed carry on college campuses  
HB 1229 - mandatory background checks for any transfer  
HB 1228 - customers paying for their own background checks  

All 4 bills passed the house, and we're waiting for them to reach the senate. Gov. Hickenlooper has been flipflopping, but he's finally announced that he's planning on signing off on these measures if they reach his desk. He's only unsure about the concealed carry on campuses.

Magpul has announced that if you're a Colorado resident, you can buy up to 10 PMAGs at factory cost with $5 shipping, bypassing all queues they already have. If you're a CO resident, sign up now and buy your mags!

http://www.magpul.com/colorado

Also, be sure to contact state senators and let them know how you feel! We only need to turn 3 of the Democrats over to kill these bills. Call and email them!

<TEXT> You'd just have to find the inputs for the speaker and splice in either the right or left audio output from the boom box. Then play journey in mono so the left and right sides of the output are the same. That's the general concept, but I'm not familiar with your particular speaker system. 

Overall it's not too hard to do, but it would most likely be destructive to the speaker's input system and since this is a prank I'm assuming you don't own the speaker. I wouldn't do it unless you're willing to potentially break an expensive speaker system that isn't yours.  </TEXT>

They will, however, eat you if you look like a nicely prepared meal that's completely defenseless.

<TEXT> Wash it with warm water and scrub it out with a clean scrubbie (no soap ever added to it). You can also use salt and a paper towel for more abrasive power if things are caked on there. Then once you're done just wipe some oil or butter or whatever you want to season it with onto the metal (you don't need to do this every time, but I like to). After awhile the oil gets absorbed into the pores of the metal and makes it effectively non-stick, and it imparts a nice rich flavor to whatever you're cooking. 

To season a new pan just add enough oil, butter, etc. to cover the bottom of the pan, or just fry up some bacon. Then set the pan on the heat for 15 minutes or so and let the oil bubble around in the hot cast iron. It will impregnate the pores of the pan and you'll have an awesome pan that cooks fantastically and requires little cleaning. </TEXT>

It comes with a free butane refill which will last a very long time. It also has an LED to light up what you're looking at (kind of hokey, but whatever), and a bottle opener at the back end.

It also works fairly well for soldering smaller parts, I used it on a fairly long project and I'm just now at 1/4 tank. And the butane refill is huge. 

$6 at home depot, you can't go wrong.

<TEXT> Check out bike trials, and learn some simple maneuvers. Learn to trackstand reasonably well, practice pedal kicking (quickly going through 1/4 rotation of the cranks, then ratcheting back) up over rocks, ride over all sorts of rocks, roots, curbs, etc. at *slow* speeds and try and keep your balance. Once you have a good balance, it should be much easier to get your way through uphill rock gardens. 

Also, on looser/ longer technical climbs I downshift into a high torque gear (usually 2-2) before the hill, and just pedal hard and consistently. Don't downshift too far though, or you'll just spin your legs too fast and get tired. Keep your revs high (and consistant) so you don't stall out. The killer is having to change gears on a climb or losing momentum because then every bump is harder to get over because you don't have momentum to help carry you through. 

As for weight distribution, you want each tire to have approximately the same weight applied on it. Too much on the front will slip out, and too much on the rear will cause wheelies and poor steering control. So for climbing you need to shift your weight forward, get low on the bike, and scooch up on the saddle to keep that balance.

There are tons of MTB tutorial videos on youtube, so check some out!

Planes aren't a sealed container, they constantly let in outside air and let out exhaust air, and of course everything is run through a HEPA filter before it gets to you little air nozzle. The air gets filtered and replaced about 15 times an hour.

<TEXT> I grew up in a completely middle-class environment. We didn't have any financial troubles, and we took vacations together as a family, but other than that we weren't really different from any other family. I'd like to think that I'm very well adjusted and my parents definitely taught me about living on my own and how to budget my own money (which they might have taken a bit too far, I'm sometimes a bit of a tightwad). 

Turns out our family has quite a bit of assets that I'm just now learning about. I'm so glad that I didn't grow up to be some rich snobby douchebag. Having a hand-me-down purple minivan as a first car and not living extravagantly while growing up really put me on the right track.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In highschool I used to work at a little rinky dink place that ended up going out of business 6 months after I left. I left once I heard they had bounced a check to Domino's Pizza. Yeah. That kind of place. 

Everyone who worked there was a lazy high school worker, and I was the only one who wasn't perpetually drunk or high on shift. Since I did actual work, they put me on the gocarts because they required a bit of attention when running, and the course needed fixing if someone crashed into the tires lining the course. 

The great thing was that our gocart track was located in the back corner of the property, and only larger kids could ride, and our place was aimed towards smaller kids. Also, I worked alot of weekdays. This meant I had tons of free time, and I continually had to "fix the track". I would turn off the limiters of the cart (which made it go *surprisingly* fast, like 40+ mph fast), and then I would hop in and drift all over the place. Fix a tire over here, drift to the other side of the course, fix a tire, drift around some more, fix another tire or two. I got damn good at doughnuts, drifts, and drifting into gocart parking spaces. 

It was fantastic, and whenever my bosses would see me they would get excited that I was actually doing work and not sitting around with a glazed look in my eyes.

Then they decided I was too reliable to be playing around with gocarts and put me on cash register on weekends. And I heard they didn't offer any raises. And that they were bouncing checks. And that they had never once cleaned the balls in the ball pit (do you know how nasty kids are? I shudder to think of all the human ooze absorbed by those foam balls). I got the fuck out of there.

EDIT: I also got heavily hit on by some 12? year old girls. They were saying some *lewd* things. *Shudder* </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Bindings:** Burton Cartels

**Boards:**   
- Primary: Atomic hatchet  
- New board (still in the mail): Atomic Alibi  
- Rock board: Salomon piece-o-shit, cost: $15  
- Splitboard: Home built off a Voile kit 

**Boots:** Salomon Solace

**Backcountry gear:**  
- Poles: Black Diamond collapsible  
- Beacon, shovel, probe: Ortovox package deal  
- Pack: Black Diamond Alias with Avalung  
- Ice Axe: Black Diamond Raven

**About me:**  
I primarily ride moguls, trees, chutes, and powder. I throughly enjoy off piste riding, and I think that the terrain park is a complete waste of time (no offense to those of you who only ride there), I'd rather ski the entire mountain rather than groomers with some pipes and ramps stuck in the middle. I can rock the moguls faster than many of my skier buddies, and I'm not afraid to do some hiking to get at that pow or to bag a mountain peak. 

**About the boards:**  
I've owned my **Atomic** board for 7 years, and it's been absolutely fantastic. It's light and nimble enough for moguls and trees, but it's stiff enough that I don't mind jamming through powder, crust, or anything in between. It is getting a little old though, so I'm upgrading in just a few days. I can't say enough about the craftsmanship and feel of Atomic boards. 

My **splitboard** is fantastic, although I don't have nearly the amount of days on it as I do on my regular board. If you're interested in the backcountry it's a great way to get into it, and if you don't want to spend a lot of coin, you can always build a splitty yourself pretty easily. The voile system makes it so that you lose very little rigidity in the board, and skinning is hands down the best self propelled way to get to the top of a mountain. Fuck snowshoes, they can go to hell and die. 

My **$15 piece-o-shit board** is probably one of my best purchases. I've had it for 3 years so for $5 a year, it's definitely earned its keep. It's not a good board by any means, but it's passable and the ability to charge hard through some sketchy trees is amazing. These last two seasons have just about killed it though, I've put more days on my rock board than my normal board... Oh well. Still worth it. It's taken on more rocks and submerged branches than you could shake a stick at.

<TEXT> At the speeds these tungsten rods will be falling, they won't have radio communications because of the plasma layer formed as the rod pressurizes and heats the air it runs into. Therefore guidance systems will have to be integrated into the rods and will have to come up with creative ways to position themselves. The guidance systems will have to be extremely reliable in conditions ranging from a vacuum to re-entry conditions, and this has always been a problem. Dropping a needle from space onto a 10 square meter target is not an insignificant task. 

Assuming the guidance systems work correctly, the very act of aiming a tungsten rod will be a huge challenge. Any fins or stabilizers will have to be extremely strong, and will have to work very quickly. At hypersonic speeds simple fins like we're used to on guided bombs will work poorly, if at all. That means coming up with another type of steering, maybe small rocket motors or something, but those would open a whole series of other problems. 

Next, you'd need to transport all this crap into space, hope it works, and hope that nobody shoots down your extremely expensive and extremely vulnerable megaweapon. It's not like our nuclear arsenals are just floating around out there at the mercy of any country that doesn't feel like being nuked. 


**TL;DR:**
Overall what will this get us? An astronomical (pun somewhat intended) debt for just a few inaccurate and highly vulnerable superweapons. Why not just fly a plane or launch a missile for an extremely tiny fraction of the cost? </TEXT>

<TEXT> SRAM X9s are quite nice and I really enjoy them, but I absolutely love that Shimano has the dual release system where you can either use your thumb or trigger finger to release cable tension. The Shimano Saint rear shifter and XT Shadow rear derailleur are probably my favorites that I've had on my bike. 

I'm currently running Elixir CR brakes and they work quite well, but Shimano brakes are a breeze to bleed and they lock up great as well. Favorite brakes so far would probably go to the Avid Code 5s I had on my downhill bike, but for all mountain brakes I'd go pretty much anything Shimano Deore or above. 

Overall, they both make some high quality products, but I might give Shimano a bit of an edge over SRAM in shifting actuation and their brakes, but that's just been my experience. I keep my shifting system real clean so the dirt and grime others have talked about haven't really affected me. However, my experience with a fleet of rental bikes I've worked on, SRAM is much more tolerant of crap in the system which happens over time. 

**Final breakdown:** Shimano Saint shifters for quick actuation, SRAM x9 or X0 if you're looking for something dependable, Shimano brakes for the win, and it's a tossup between cranksets because there's just so many options for them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My first full suspension was a used Dawg that held up great. It was unfortunately stolen, but now I'm riding a 2011 Kona Abra Cadabra and that thing is a wonderful piece of machinery. I also had a Kona Stab downhill bike. It was pretty good, but I fractured my wrist pretty bad and decided that full on downhill riding wasn't all that fun. I much prefer all-mountain riding. 

My friend also has a Dawg and loves it to death. I haven't come across anyone with anything bad to say about them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'll need access to a circular saw or a table saw, preferably a drill press but a handheld drill would work if you're careful, a few drill bits, some clamps, a straight edge, some [G-flex epoxy](http://www.westsystem.com/ss/g-flex-epoxy/), an old paintbrush or two, and a [voile split kit](http://www.voile.com/voile-splitboard-hardware/voile-split-kit-diy.html). 

All you have to do is cut down the middle, drill a handful of holes, epoxy the edges, set in your hardware, and epoxy everything in place. It's all very simple if you've worked with these tools in any manner before. The trickiest part is drilling all the holes straight through the board, but it is made exponentially easier with a drill press. 

If you're interested in doing it yourself, check out this 2 part video. It's super informative and will walk you through every step of the process. If it seems like something you can do, give it a shot!

<TEXT> Honestly, basically the only cost difference between a premade splitty and a homemade one is the time and effort put in. It's a time intensive process for a niche market, so it's going to be relatively expensive. I knew a few friends who would offer to split boards for people, but for the labor price it was almost more economical to get a pre-made board. And I know they've closed up shop since, and I haven't found any more manufacturers like them around.

For me, I wanted a project, and I wanted to be able to get places on snow faster. I have the skills required to make a board (and not too many skills are required), so I knew I could do it. If you're not sure you can make one yourself, I would just buy a pre made one. It's only a little bit more expensive (after you factor in the cost of your board), and you get a much nicer ride and touring quality. 

If you're just looking to save money and not do any work, take a look on craigslist. Pick up a used setup for cheap, sometimes they'll even come with some extra goodies like crampons or avvy gear thrown in </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stopped downhilling after I badly fractured my wrist, but I like full suits because there's less to move around, it keeps everything in place. It's kind of annoying to have your elbow pads twist around a bit over a day of riding. It's really personal preference, but I like having everything stay in place. It's a bit hotter, but the ease of use is nice. Definitely try one on if you can though, there's nothing worse than an ill-fitting clothes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've got a 2006 Torker DX, and it's been holding up admirably (and I've put that thing through some hell). It's a bit heavier than nicer brands like Kris Holm unis, but they're built like a bomb and are relatively cheap. The newer versions are *considerably* nicer than the one I've got, and they're about the same price. 

http://www.unicycle.com/torker-dx-20-inch-trials.html

If you're looking to do muni only I'd get a 24" wheel, but if you want to do a bit of everything you can't go wrong with a 20" wheel. They're nice and light and have the most support with respect to wheels, tires, tubes, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That AK-47 isn't. It's a crudely drawn mashup of an AK and an AR-15. The Shell casings aren't casings, they're entire cartridges, meaning they haven't been shot, but they're flying through the air somehow. And lastly, both AKs and ARs eject in the opposite direction, so even if the casings were correct, the rifle is pointing in the wrong direction.

<TEXT> YES! Use the G-flex! Jb weld isn't nearly flexible enough and will likely chip off under the intense vibrations of snowboarding (especially when on a crusty top layer). It's also mainly meant for bonding metal so it won't adhere well to your cut surface. 

G-flex is amazing, and once you're done making your splitty you can use it for almost anything. Definitely drop the coin for some good epoxy or you'll be constantly fixing and trying to repair your board(s).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, just find a competition in your area and show up one time.  Help set up stages, email the director, just show that you're interested. Almost everyone I've met in action shooting is super nice and helpful. Not too many people shoot action competitions so it's always fun to see someone new. It is a bit costly, but it's so damn fun that after just one match you'll be hooked. 

Each competition you'll be shooting a couple hundred rounds (on average), and you'll need a handful of magazines and magazine pouches/holders.  

Pouches can get expensive, so if you're any good at sewing I'd suggest making your own. It's super easy and it'll save you *quite* a bit of coin. I started shooting 3-gun so you need 2 more guns worth of gear. That's why I started making my own stuff.

I made a post about sewing your own awhile ago, check it out. I can give you some tips if this seems interesting for you. I made a whole 3-gun setup including belt for less than $10. I am by no means a good sewer, so it's something almost anyone can do.

<TEXT> First, find some [5/8" SAE flat washers](http://www.engineering.com/Library/ArticlesPage/tabid/85/ArticleID/118/Washer-Size-Chart.aspx). They're pretty cheap from a hardware store, and you only need 5-10 of them depending on the length of your average turd. These will be the baffles.

Once this is done, you need to buy a piece of [1-5/16" OD tube](http://www.speedymetals.com/showproduct.aspx?productid=3457) and cut it into 3/8" pieces. These will be the spacers.

Next, you need to get 12" of [1-5/16 ID pipe](http://www.onlinemetals.com/merchant.cfm?pid=7562 step=4 showunits=inches id=283 top_cat=0) (you can cut it down to fit later). This will be the sheath that holds everything together.

To assemble the device, first weld a washer to one of the open ends of your sheath. Then, alternately layer your 3/8" pieces of tubing and your washers. To cap off your creation, set your final washer in place, cut the sheath flush with this final washer, and weld it in place. Finally, be sure to grind down your welds and deburr everything. You want a silky smooth exterior of your device. 

Congratulations, you have finished creating your shit silencer. Simply insert into your rectum and enjoy your effortless shits, silent farts, and greatly reduced cleanup.

<TEXT> If people can grow and sell on a local level, it will cut out much of the smuggling from Mexico. Why import when you have a warehouse full of it just down the street? I don't smoke, but I'm all for the legalization. Tax revenue will increase, violent marijuana crime will greatly diminish, and normal people will stop being harassed for what they do in their spare time.

As long as anything is illegal, there's a black market for it. The aim here is to drastically cut the size of the black market </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, yes. Some secular Jews don't partake, but it is still a common occurrence. 

From Genesis ch 17:

10 This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.   
11 And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt Me and you.   
12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner, that is not of thy seed.   
13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.   
14 And the circumcised male who does not pin the flesh of his foreskin to his door, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken My covenant.

<TITLE> April 2012 Rifle Match - Iron Sights </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-04-02 00:25:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Congratulations to everyone who participated! Sewiv is our April winner, and will be making next month's competition!**

Welcome to the April 2012 iron sights rifle match! Hopefully we'll get a good turnout now that things are thawing out for spring.

**Target   Distance** 

[Here is the target](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JDYSXGPMdOJfL5s0_rfEsKlVPyHyInz30Kw_2UYtbpg/edit) we'll be shooting at, an April fool. Print it on a standard 8.5x11" paper (A4 for you non-americans out there). Distance will be at 50 yards with any caliber you want. ARs, mosins, black powder, .50 cal, .22, whatever you want. 

**Scoring**

The center is 10, and it decreases by one every ring. Hitting the paper nets you 1 point. If you break a line, you get the higher of the two scores. 

**Position** 

Everybody has that one position that they wished they had worked on more, and for alot of people that position is sitting or kneeling. Nobody wants to look like a fool when they shoot so for this month's competition we'll be shooting in the [NRA sitting position](http://i.imgur.com/iuDuK.png) and the [NRA kneeling position](http://i.imgur.com/VhfFq.png). Slings and kneeling rolls are OK, just no artificial rests for the gun like sandbags or anything like that. 

**Submission** 

Please scan your targets and upload them. Pictures are OK if you don't have a scanner, just make sure everything is legible. Also, pictures of your rifle and range are always appreciated!

**Course of fire**

We'll shoot a total of 10 shots, 5 from each position. Print off 2 targets and shoot one position at each. If need be you can shoot everything on one target, but that won't give good information about the groups you get in each position.

Feel free to sight in as much as you want, just submit your best score (1 submission per person).

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! This is my first time running a competition so hopefully it'll go well. Good luck everyone!

**Scores**

*sewiv* - 43

*x888x* - 40

*Smedly25* - 34

*pavelft* - 31

*DoubleCorona* - 14

*emajae* - 8 </TEXT>

<TITLE> Has anybody had a broken wrist? How'd you recover from it? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I broke my right wrist 3.5 months ago downhill biking, and about 2 weeks ago I finally got out my cast. I can't climb or put weight on it yet (it's still fairly stiff), but I was just wondering if anybody had good stretches or "introductory" exercises that I could do to gain some flexibility and ease me back into climbing. 

Thanks guys! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does anyone else ride moguls/chutes? What bindings do you use? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-10-07 07:38:02 </DATE>

<TEXT> So I'm not your typical snowboarder. I ride with primarily skiiers, and almost never hit the park unless it's on the way to the base of wherever I'm riding (which is pretty uncommon). I can't 360, ride fakie, or do anything other than 50/50 on a rail, but I can shred the hell out of a mogul run. I ride moguls, chutes, and powder allllll day long and I LOVE it. I can beat most skiers down a double black, and I don't mind hiking to hit the gnarly pillow lines. I also splitboard in early/late season to hit up the untouched remote areas (DIY splitboards are the shit!). 

I've been riding for 11 years, 6-7 of which were with my current bindings. I love them, but the straps have broken so many times it's ridiculous (they're currently black webbing with about 4" of plastic OEM strap material sewed to the ends), and the ratchets are pretty much dead as well. Since I've been using the same gear for so long, I'm super out of it when it comes to brands and features.

So I'm looking for some bindings that would be good for riding moguls and chutes. Anyone have any good recommendations? 

**TL;DR** - I need bindings for riding moguls/chutes, any suggestions? </TEXT>
