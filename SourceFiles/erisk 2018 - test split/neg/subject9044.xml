<TEXT> Totally agree. They're creating hype. Based on what I've seen in the trailer, it looks just like John Wick action (only a bit slower, since Keanu is more seasoned). But at this point, they're making some bold statements and setting themselves up for failure. Hope i'm wrong. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great list. Here are mine. Not sure if these are my greatest ones, so for this practice, Ill just call these my favorite entrance scenes

Game of Death  In the context of sitting through about an hour or so of body doubles, spliced footage, card board cut outs, sunglasses and beards, the REAL Bruce Lee finally shows himself on the screen. From the moment he arrives at the top of the stairs, his electrifying charisma practically gives you goosebumps. Add some crisp sound effects, dubbed battle cries, and the result: One hell of an entrance! 

Man from Hong Kong  Not a fight sequence, not even an action scene, but its just as badass: At the start of the credit sequence, Wang Yu appears on the screen shooting his gun to the tune of Jigsaws Sky High. If you dont think this scene is cool, then youre low budget. 

Fist of Fury  When Bruce Lee enters the Japanese dojo delivering the Sick men of Asia sign. What follows is a short verbal exchange that leads into one of the most iconic fight scenes (one that has been duplicated many, many times). 

A Hero Never Dies  I hope this non-martial arts movie counts  again, not even an action scene. When Lau Ching Wan first appears at the beginning of the movie. All you see is somewhat of a shadowy figure of a guy in a car wearing cowboy hat (yet, its obvious its Lau) with his laser site rifle aiming directly on Sia Pios (aka Leon Lais) face. Only Johnnie To could pull off this ultra stylish, Spaghetti-Westernish scene the way he does. Top it off with the Hans Zimmer-like score and you have the epitome of cool. Johnnie To was at his best in the late 90s.

Armor of God  You probably would have to have seen this in late 80s to fully appreciate this one. After seeing Jackie play kung fu heroes, kung fu bad guys and cops we finally get to see him as a 007/Indiana Jones type. His short hair, his crossbow, his gloves, his confident gum chewing its no wonder Japanese girls jumped off buildings for this guy. After his entrance, we get a little goofy comedy. Next thing you know, Jackie steals the sword (slicing a few chests in the process) and proceeds with a short, but sweet fight followed by the infamous chase that almost led to Jackies real life death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's thing thing... there was only one reported (proof) case of domestic violence toward's Nicole from OJ. Yet, on all these TV documentaries they constantly play 911 recordings during a call where OJ did NOT touch her the night of; then follow up that recording with Nicole's bruised face (selective editing). OJ is definitely not a saint, but I don't think he should be the poster boy for spousal abuse  you'd be amazed at the list of celebrities with domestic abuse, yet they're never mentioned. My mind was made up when I read Stephen Singular's book. Then if you add the EDTA (most want to refute this, but they don't find EDTA in blood straight from the human body), defensive wounds on Ron, and non-OJ flesh under Nicole's nails... and all the blood evidence that would only make sense is some crazy time warp. It's all interesting...    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right. And I guess that's why this case is still intriguing after all these years. We can all play Sherlock Holmes all we want (and I'm speaking to myself, mostly), but there's only two people (3, if you count the dog) who REALLY know who the real killer(s) is/are ... and sadly, they're no longer here.

It wouldn't be fun if we KNEW exactly what happened, right? :) ("fun" is probably not the proper word, but you know what I mean) </TEXT>

I'll be honest, I can't say he did it/or didn't do it for sure, but based on everything I've consumed, I lean more (a lot more) towards his innocence. And sure, 1-3 killers make more sense (with O.J. included). If you do decide to read the book, hope to hear your thoughts, regardless if your thoughts go against mine. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Correct, EDTA is in food. There was a test done by some documentary (I forget which one). But basically, some dude ate at McDonalds (I think he actually ate TWO Big Macs) - similar to the meal Simpson ate that day). Long story short, EDTA didn't show up in his blood when he was tested later that day. And until I hear a recording of the phone call between det Phillips and Simpson, it's nothing but hearsay.

Oh, and I think the murders were drug related. Brent Cantor and Michael Nigg (both were in the circle of "drug" friends involving Ron... Ron's sister even dated one of them. They were both assassinated in the same vein around the same time Ron was...). 

I advise you to read Stephen Singular's book (I obviously don't expect you to at my say.... but it's an interesting read, and to me, the deal breaker). You have some points, but would love to hear what you think after reading this book that even Jeffrey Toobin doesn't know about.

I just don't want to be one of these things were we go back 'n fourth forever, ya know? ;)  Again, appreciate your time in replying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> jaxwtf, thanks for your reply. I've seen it. I've also seen the TV series, and have also read numerous books. You have the right to your opinion, and I respect it. But how do you explain the EDTA found in the blood? How do you explain the missing blood from the vile (that had O.J.'s blood, which was given to LAPD voluntarily)? How do you explain the flesh found under Nicole's fingernails? (didn't match OJ's DNA); how do you explain the bruises on Ron's fists? (O.J. had no bruises); how do you explain NO BLOOD in O.J.'s ransacked plumbing at his house? The word "conspiracy" is thrown around too lightly. Honestly, answer some of my questions and if you give me some FACTS (not speculation), I will change my mind (and I mean that in a non-sarcastic way).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have loved to see a OJ documentary in a similar vein to MAKING OF A MURDERER. There are some great non-mainstream documentaries out there (such as the work of Brian Heiss  check out his vids on youtube and on this subreddit); Sure, the ESPN doc was nice and polished but one-sided (leaning more towards his guilt). As far as books, again, great ones out there, but most Americans won't look that deep - instead they'll listen to the BS that is repeated over and over again from mainstream media. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree with your examples.

Well, at least O.J. will *hopefully* be set free this year. If he does, he needs to keep it on the down low. But I do look forward to what he has to say about everything that has happened in while he was in prison (Oscar doc, TV series, etc).

But my main wish is for people to actually believe he's innocent instead of what the media throws out there. Sadly, this will most likely never happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any American citizen willing to convict this man on faulty and quite frankly contaminated evidence is not a true American. If you were you would KNOW that this belief went against OJ's constitutional rights and had he been found guilty he would have appealed  and the appellate court would have reversed the trial court's decision and either did one of two things. Free him or grant him a new trial. Either way, those who believe him to be guilty would have still lost either way so thank God the jury used common sense and recognized the fact that reasonable double had been created in this case. Aside from all that, let's look at the evidence. Many of those who believe in OJ's guilt swear they're scholars because they claim to have watched the whole trial from beginning to end. They continuously stipulate that on the premise of OJ's blood even remotely being at the crime scene...HE'S GUILTY without taking into account that  first and foremost you had a racist cop on the force, secondly, the crime scene had been contaminated, and thirdly,  the evidence itself could not be trusted.

 Let me reiterate to you this point. When a crime scene is disturbed or contaminated, none of the evidence that is found there can be trusted. If a prosecutor still decides to go ahead and introduce that faulty evidence at trial they take a huge gamble. That is like asking a question that you don't know the answer to. That was Marcia Clark's first mistake but not her last mistake in this case. Her case was hinged on two things...1. The fact that OJ was a batterer and 2. OJ's blood being found at the crime scene and at his home. She thought for sure that she had a slam dunk case with those two things. That was mistake number two.  Now mind you, I tried with all my might to believe that OJ was guilty beyond all doubt, not just reasonable doubt but after watching this trial I came to the conclusion that there was no way that he could have done this. Now whether he knew about it before or after the fact remains to be seen. If he knew about it before the fact, he would have been an accessory before the fact and would have gotten the same charge brought against him...first degree murder. If he knew about it after the fact he would have been an accessory after the fact where this charge is not as harsh as the charge for an accessory before the fact. Moving on. 

The prosecutors contended that OJ was in a rage on that night. They even brought forth witnesses to attest to his character on that day at his daughter's recital..That was mistake number 3. The defense blew that claim and those witnesses out of the water where they showed OJ in a most joyful mood. Laughing and joking with Nicole's father and hugging and kissing Denise Brown. In other words, Denise Brown straight up lied about OJ's mood. So I submit to you, where was OJ's rage? Point established. Question: Why were the telephone records suppressed? In other words, if OJ was as guilty as they say he was, why was the telephone records not submitted into court proceedings? I submit to you that the telephone records alone would have exonerated OJ without the need for trial to continue?  Moving forward. Here comes Mark Furhman. Thought he was an ok guy. Thought he answered questions on the stand to the best of his ability until BAM those tapes came out that proved that not only was he a racist but he was a genocidal racist. That was mistake number four for the prosecution. The defense had a field day with that pile of shit. He denied that he ever called a black person a nigger in the last 10 years but just as recent as 1989  or somewhere around there he was using the word nigger quicker than water coming out of a faucet. He contends that if he saw a black man he would plant evidence against him. He also contended that he would like to put all black people together and burn them. Why is it hard to believe that someone of that caliber would not plant evidence against OJ. Of course he ran into OJ before, saw how OJ was living until he saw that OJ was with a white woman and he couldn't have that and told himself this. I will get that nigger one day and that one day came in the wee hours of June 13th 1994. This was his chance. As an officer of the law if you know that you are being accused of something that you know that you did not do you would state that you did not do it. I don't care how you slice the pie or what you say about oh he had to take the fifth. Remember that he had already perjured himself. How was him stating that he didn't plant or manufacture evidence in this case  going to incriminate him any further? The fact remains that he denied, denied, denied and that is what made the public and eventually the jury hate his pathetic ass. Of course, we're dealing with an officer who was with the LAPD who had been known to target minorities. Moving on. 

The glove debacle. How is it possible that OJ's blood got on the front part of the glove that was found behind the guest house? HOW? I want someone to make me understand this...Mich Cumstein, a fellow You Tuber, gave me the following explanation....."When taking the right hand glove off, he transferred blood onto it."...OJ would have had to be bleeding on his left hand in order for blood to get on the front surface of the glove found at Rockingham. OJ only had a cut on his left middle finger and that cut was not consistent with Ron or Nicole scratching him as OJ's skin would have been found under either of their nails nor would that cut have created enough amount of blood to transfer on that glove unless it was wiped on it. Also, To further my point, Ron Goldman had very short nails. Nicole had acrylic nails. It would be hard to make that type of cut.  The prosecution, thanks to Chris Darden, decided to make OJ try on those gloves...Mistake number five, which really cost them their case. How stupid can Darden be? Many people want to explain away the way OJ tried on those gloves. i.e. OJ was making it look like the gloves didn't fit. i.e. latex under the gloves, i.e. OJ stopped taking his arthritis medicine which made his hands swollen and thus this is why the gloves didn't fit. All of those statements are preposterous. The fact remains that Darden asked a question that he didn't know the answer to and failed greatly. Whether OJ pretended or not remains to be seen but from my perspective he really was trying to put on those gloves.  Back to the blood...Many people hinge OJ's guilt on the fact that his blood was found at both the crime scene and at his home..that meant that he was the killer but please tell me why Vannatter did not book OJ's vile of blood to Parker Center but instead so say forgot and carried that blood with him to both the crime scene and OJ's house? How is it possible for blood to be so neatly dropped in that manner? If you cut your hand deep enough to where it starts bleeding, and you start walking the blood won't drop as neatly as it did at both the crime scene and OJ's home where prosecutors contend that it was his blood. Why was blood even on Nicole's back gate? It was planted there. On to the socks. 

How did blood get on OJ's socks? If OJ had on those socks while killing Nicole and Ron how is it possible that blood seeped from one side of the sock to the other side of the sock. left to right? Let's say I have a pair of socks on and I drop blood on that sock, it would not seep through the sock as my body part is in it. Makes no sense. The blue knit cap was not consistent with OJ's hair BUT with an African American's hair. Why are people still under the assumption that it had to be OJ's hair when DNA did not prove that? William Dear has the best theory and more evidence that supports the fact that Jason Simpson is responsible for those murders. Please look at the docuseries coming January 15th 2017 on ID Discovery. Jason Simpson wore a blue knit cap that was found at the murder scene. A month or two later he's seen in a photo wearing a grey ski cap. Jason Simpson had no alibis for the night in question either. Jason Simpson threatened his co-worker or boss with a knife. He also threatened his girlfriend with a knife and I believe cut her hair with a knife. Jason Simpson has what is called intermittent rage disorder and was prescribed medication called Depakote where it calmed him if he was on it. Weeks before the murders he stopped taking that medication. Jason Simpson has a volatile history and even wrote crazy shit in his journal...In 1994 this is a following excerpt of how he felt and what he wrote....""A knife cuts away the parts of something not needed. This is the year of the knife for me! So what exactly did he mean by that. Anyway stay tuned because I believe William Dear even though there are people trying to discredit this man based on the fact that they really don't want to believe that OJ Simpson is innocent of this crime and will fight the truth no matter what which makes people in this God forsaken country sad. They would rather stay convinced that an innocent man is guilty of this crime rather than believe that someone who displayed psychotic tendencies and who had deep anger issues  who had been wounded by Nicole when she stiffed him on that Sunday night by not coming to his restaurant like she promised could not have committed this crime. People have psychological issues in this country when they would rather believe fiction over facts...

Despite me not being an avid believer of the "Jason did it theory," (I still think it was drug dealer related) I was happy to see a mainstream documentary favoring OJ's innocence, only to find out it would end up totally against him.  here's his facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamCDear/ just scroll down a bit and look at his Jan 21st post. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just recently, Bill Dear addressed the timecard thing on his facebook. Here's what he said: "Next, I would like to address the concerns regarding Jason Simpsons time card. It was not until the last minutes of production when Derrick got up to disclose his thoughts about the time card. I listened intently as Derrick proceeded with his theory. I wanted to respond to it but was told it was not necessary, just let it go. I have been assured by the financial partner of the restaurant that, while the time card machine was working properly and all other employees had used it that night, Jason Simpson had not used the time card machine to check in or out that night. I was also told that the each employee's name was printed on a label and placed in the upper right hand corner of the time card. On this time card the label was obviously missing and in its place Jason had hand written his own name. Both the financial partner and the operating owner of Jacksons came to me with their concerns that Jasons time card had been altered on the night of the murders, and was handwritten, in and out, by Jason Simpson." </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to William Dear: 

"As to Glen Rogers. His own mother and sister have said his brother Clay lied about Glen being the murderer in the Simpson case. Clay went back to prison trying to use his brother's fame and the scam failed. I have known about Rogers for over 15 years. There is no truth, and zero evidence at the crime scene, to support the theory that Glen Rogers killed Nicole and Ron, that I can assure you of that." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is where EON needs to change. Sure, have a general set of rules (makes sense), but they get down to the nitty gritty. But then again, you can't blame them, as the franchise just works.

<TEXT> I agree. I'm looking forward to it. It hasn't even been officially released, so you won't get a lot of opinions. Any film that's a "biopic" or based on real events should be taken with a grain of salt. For instance, for entertainment purposes, DRAGON: THE BRUCE LEE STORY is a good movie; but as far as depicting the fact, the movie fails in nearly every way.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the craft  but i guess my whole point is, sure keep on pumping 'em out, but for the people who prefer detailed "action figures" (i.e. NECA) and/or for the people who can't afford to collect the high-end figures, give us what we want. I mean, they'd be great. I can only imagine the possibilities and accessories, etc. The world of Bond has so many colorful characters, they're just screaming for a more affordable/collectible option.

<TEXT> We park our cars in the same garage. They pull the same crap with Bruce Lee figures. I mean, is there some large demographic of RICH people who collect $600 dolls? Part of me thinks EON doesn't want to sell themselves out (i.e. cheapen the brand, as you stated) to the tacky world of action figures (which is why they stay with "dolls"), but then again, they do have Hot wheels (and they did make Die Another Day hehe)... don't even get me started with James Bond Jr. (not sure, but may EON doesn't have any part of that series). The best part about all this are the NECA figures, to me, look better than these dolls. The clothes always looked too puffy or something is off about 'em. Even if I did have $600 to spend on a doll (or if they were reasonably priced), I still wouldn't be interested in "dolls". I appreciate all the "realistic" details, but honestly, I don't need to see every piece of pubic hair. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, this new show is coming out in January. As far as the drug cartels, it's all over... but let me show you a couple of links (which are on this subreddit:

Also, Stephen Singular, the author who wrote LEGACY OF DECEPTION (read book BTW), said he received a letter from someone who delivered CRATES of cocaine to Mezzaluna on a regular basis (and many of its waiters were "delivery" boys, i.e. Ron)....

<TEXT> Yeah, it's kinda kooky isn't it? But I'm sure the show will have some insightful elements (here and there). We'll see. :) I personally don't believe the "OJ's Son Did It" theory, but anything is possible. I still think the murders are drug cartel related.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Simpson's Lawyer Hints Slayings Were Mistake by Drug Dealers

Published: March 9, 1995

LOS ANGELES, March 8 The chief defense lawyer and the chief police investigator in the O. J. Simpson case continued their seemingly endless fencing match today, delving into topics lik ethe rate at which ice cream melts and the murder methods used by Colombian drug lords.

The lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., elaborated on his assertion that Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were not the victims of a jealous former husband but of irate drug dealers who had set out last June to kill one of Mrs. Simpson's friends -- one of their customers -- instead.

Continuing his effort to offer some plausible alternative to the prosecution's case, Mr. Cochran suggested that the very brutality of the killings indicated that the perpetrators were drug dealers out to collect a debt, and that the real target was Faye Resnick, who was living with Mrs. Simpson, and taking drugs, around the same time.

In yet another round of questions for the detective, Tom Lange, Mr. Cochran implied that the police had turned a "blind eye" to any theories that would have cleared Mr. Simpson of the crimes. He also hinted that Mr. Lange implicated Mr. Simpson last June because Marcia Clark, the chief prosecutor in the case, already had.

Mr. Cochran's most graphic questions, concerning the brutal techniques used by Colombian drug lords, were intended to challenge an assertion by Mr. Lange that most drug-related killings do not involve knives. It was one of many reasons Mr. Lange offered for his conclusion that drugs had nothing to do with the crimes.

Mr. Cochran asked Mr. Lange whether he had ever heard of two ways drug dealers disposed of drug users in arrears: a "Colombian necklace," slang for murder by slashed throat, and a "Colombian necktie," a variation in which the victim's tongue is pulled through the slit.

In a series of thinly veiled "hypothetical" questions, he then asked the detective whether his views would have changed had it turned out that Ms. Resnick had lived briefly with Mrs. Simpson shortly before the killings, had been "freebasing cocaine on a daily basis" while there and had been too broke to pay for her habit.

"If I felt this was a drug-related murder, certainly," Mr. Lange said. "But that wasn't the evidence that I had and that wasn't the path that I pursued. I had nothing to lead me in that direction."

Mr. Cochran then asked why, if the investigation is ongoing, Mr. Lange had still not pursued the matter. "You don't turn a blind eye on evidence just because it might point toward Mr. Simpson's innocence, do you?" he asked.

The detective replied: "The fact that a victim's friend uses drugs is of very little consequence to me. The fact that every bit of evidence that I have in this case points towards the defendant has a lot more to do with it."

Mr. Cochran asked him whether Mr. Lange was speaking for himself or, really, for Ms. Clark.

"My theory has always been there was only one murderer," Mr. Lange said. "I don't know what her theory is. I believe her theory is the same as mine."

Questioned by prosecutors earlier, Mr. Lange testified that the very savagery of the slayings pointed to a different breed of killer. Drug-related killings, he said, are cleaner and more efficient, carried out with guns. "This appeared to me to be an overkill or a rage killing," he testified.

Mr. Lange will return to the stand on Thursday, two weeks after he first sat there.

Judge Ito made little effort today to rein in the defense lawyer, even when his questions were repetitious or beyond the scope of Ms. Clark's direct examination. At the current pace, Ms. Clark warned Judge Ito at the bench on Tuesday, "this case is going to go on for the next century."

Once Mr. Lange steps down -- and after a brief appearance by Patty Goldman, Mr. Goldman's stepmother -- the stage will finally be set for the much-anticipated testimony of Detective Mark Fuhrman, the man who found behind Mr. Simpson's house a bloody glove matching one found at the crime scene. Defense lawyers say Mr. Fuhrman is a racist who may have placed the glove there to frame Mr. Simpson; for months they have dropped his name ominously at every opportunity.

At a news conference this afternoon Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles District Attorney, called assertions that Mr. Fuhrman was "a make or break witness" for the prosecution "hype on the media's part." Mr. Garcetti would not say whether prosecutors would bring up Mr. Fuhrman's racial attitudes themselves in an effort to defuse the issue.

After the defense allegations surfaced, police officials questioned the 14 officers in the Simpson case about Mr. Fuhrman's conduct. Today, Judge Ito ordered that those interviews be furnished to the defense. And, as Mr. Simpson's lawyers had also requested, he directed the relevant police officers to tell the defense anything Mr. Fuhrman might have told them about Mrs. Simpson's "breast augmentation" -- a manifestation, Mr. Simpson's lawyers have hinted, of his obsession with her.

But he denied a defense request for information regarding what it said was "a swastika or other Nazi-like insignia" Mr. Fuhrman may have kept at the station house, saying it was "irrelevant."

In her turn with Mr. Lange, Ms. Clark played a video of police officers closing -- or, in law-enforcement lingo, "breaking down" -- the crime scene. It showed one officer taking down and crumpling up yellow police tape and another picking up the bloody sheet that had covered Mrs. Simpson while, in a Fellini-like touch, a young boy on roller skates careened by.

The defense had used a frame from that video, without saying when it was taken, to suggest that the police had traipsed willy-nilly through the crime scene; Ms. Clark hoped to show that the picture was clearly taken after care was no longer needed.

Then it was Mr. Cochran's turn. Usually glib and silver-tongued, he had a hostile, impatient edge as he questioned Mr. Lange. Some questions were prefaced with an incredulous "You're the lead investigator in this case and you've never . . . ?" Others were sarcastic, like one posed after Mr. Lange testified that Mrs. Simpson's family, and not the police, had ascertained the flavor of the ice cream found at her home after the killings.

"The Brown family, they're not members of the L.A.P.D., are they?" he asked sharply.

Mr. Cochran contends that had the melting rate of the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream been tested, it would have revealed a time of death too late for Mr. Simpson to have committed the crimes. That ice cream was ordered by Mr. Simpson's young son; but Mr. Cochran faulted Mr. Lange for failing to test the melting rate of rainforest crunch, the flavor Mrs. Simpson had ordered and apparently finished eating.

Mr. Cochran tried to extract mea culpas from Mr. Lange for various investigative mistakes. He asked Mr. Lange whether he had learned in the police academy to carry potentially important evidence under his arm rather than in a box.

Told that a coroner's assistant had failed to preserve the blood on Mrs. Simpson's back, as Mr. Lange had requested, Mr. Cochran asked whether the two had conversed in English.

Mr. Lange did his best to repress his annoyance, answering with a straight face questions like whether he had ever read any books about the need to place the hands of crime victims in plastic bags. Sometimes, however, he managed to say more.

He brushed aside suggestions that he had not sufficiently considered the degree to which Mrs. Simpson's blood had settled in ascertaining the time of death.

"He was cooperative to the extent that he sat down and spoke with us," Mr. Lange said. "I don't believe he was cooperative in being entirely forthcoming with us."

<TEXT> **Mary Anne Gerchas**: Reported that she saw four men fleeing the crime scene. One Caucasian, two Hispanic. None was O.J. Simpson. The Prosecution claimed she was not even in the area that night. She pleaded guilty for fraud unrelated to the Simpson matter.

**Lief Tilden**: Stated that he saw four men at Bundy.

**Frank Chiuchiolo**: Claimed to be near the crime scene, casing a house for burglary. Saw Caucasian and Latino men at the Crime Scene about the time of the murders. The Defense decided not to call the convicted felon to testify.

You know, even crappy Bond films are STILL good (with the exception of some of those Brosnan flicks). lol Enjoy!

<TITLE> "The only good n_____ is a dead n_____."  Mark Fuhrman </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-09 19:19:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On August 31, Judge Ito ruled that evidence could be introduced to prove that Fuhrman had lied about use of the word "nigger", but that claims of violence and police misconduct were inadmissible.[28] On September 5, the defense produced multiple witnesses and audiotape to establish that Fuhrman had used the word "nigger" within the last ten years.[5] The audiotape eventually resulted in a perjury conviction for Fuhrman.

First, Laura Hart McKinny took the stand. Between 1985 and 1994, Fuhrman gave taped interviews to McKinny, a writer working on a screenplay about female police officers. Fuhrman was working as a consultant for McKinny, under the understanding that he would be paid $10,000 if a movie were produced. The recordings contain forty-one instances of the word "nigger" used as recently as 1988,[32] including references in which he claimed to have perpetrated violence against African-Americans.[29] In the recordings, Fuhrman also describes how, as a police officer, he thought lying was sometimes necessary and claims that he has provided testimony regarding events that he did not actually witness.[29]

After McKinny, witness Kathleen Bell testified. She met Fuhrman at a Marine recruiting station in 1985 or 1986,[32] where he expressed animus against interracial couples and stated, "If I had my way, all the niggers would be gathered together and burned."[32][2][33] Then, witness Natalie Singerwhose roommate had dated Fuhrman around 1987testified that Fuhrman had told her, "The only good nigger is a dead nigger."[2][32] On the television show Leeza, Singer would later state that Fuhrman had also claimed, "Yeah we work with niggers and gangs. You can take one of these niggers, drag 'em into the alley and beat the shit out of them and kick them. You can see them twitch. It really relieves your tension."[34] However, Judge Ito restricted her from giving her complete statement during the trial.[35] Roderic Hodge then testified that while he was in police custody in 1987, Fuhrman had said to him, "I told you we would get you, Nigger."[36][37]

Ultimately, the jury was only allowed to hear two excerpts from the Fuhrman tapes, which did not include the inflammatory violent content or material related to potential misconduct. Jurors heard Fuhrman say, "We have no niggers where I grew up," and, "That's where niggers live."[28] With the jury absent on September 6, the defense asked Fuhrman whether he had ever falsified police reports or if he had planted or manufactured evidence in the Simpson case. Although he had earlier responded "no" when asked this question, this time he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination on his lawyer's advice.[38]

During his closing argument, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran referred to Fuhrman as "a lying, perjuring, genocidal racist"[39] and he analogized Fuhrman to Hitler.[40] He argued that Fuhrman had planted the bloody glove on O.J. Simpson's estate as part of a racially motivated plot against Simpson, which could be traced back to his first meeting with the interracial couple in 1985.[39] Although there was no evidence to suggest that Fuhrman had planted the glove, his perjury regarding use of the word "nigger" was widely seen as severely damaging the prosecution's credibility in front of the mostly black jury (especially in the wake of the Rodney King trial[41]), and it has been cited as one of the key reasons that Simpson was acquitted.[3]

<TEXT> Great questions. I'll try my best to answer...

**Why does OJ run?**

He never "ran". It was the media who called it a "chase". He just lost his ex-life, his image, and was heavily sedated/depressed. And he knew that from this point on, he'd be a victim of character assassination and his career would be over. Remember, he had already been accused (even put in handcuffs), and he had been told his blood was "found" at the scene. There was no way out. He knew he'd be stuck with being tagged a "murderer" whether he did it or not  and that's exactly what happened. My thinking is that he wanted to see his family (in addition to the above) one more time before being put behind bars for months  as he knew he'd be tried. But remember, this wasn't a chase. If it were a chase, they'd be going faster than 40 mph (and AC wouldn't be assisting him, especially in another high-profile, white Bronco). 

**Why did OJ have a disguise in his car and money?**

The disguise he had in his bag before he was even arrested (Kardashian questioned him about it, when he saw it in his bags on his way back from Chicago... ). As he states "What am I going to do with a beard? I'd still look like OJ Simpson without it" or something like that. The money, from what I remember, was to be given to Al Collings, because OJ knew he'd be heading to jail, so he wanted to give some cash to certain family members while he'd be locked away for what might be days/months. A lot of people relied on OJ's income at this time, including the Browns, even after his break up/divorce with Nicole.

**Why did OJ fail a lie detector test?** 

Simpson told Rob Kardashian he had flunked the test because he was very emotional. Legal professionals agree that this is a common problem with lie detector tests. The American Psychological Association has even claimed that the science behind polygraphs can be "controversial." Innocent people can sometimes respond like guilty people, depending on how they react under stress and the types of questions asked. Likewise, it is supposedly possible to "beat" lie detector tests if you know how to control your answers and reactions. 

**Why did OJ not know how he cut his finger?**

There have been times when I have gotten cuts, scrapes and bruises where I didn't know they came from. It is a proven fact that broken glass was found in his Chicago room (there's photos of it), which happened after he went nuts upon hearing about Nicole's murder. When someone dies, especially family, your mind is all over the place. When being questioned by the two cops, his mind was most likely going 10,000 MPH. It was only later, when calmed down, that he realized how he cut it.

Remember, one cut doesn't leave a trail of blood from one place, to another. To me, it makes more sense that the blood was taken from the vile of OJ's sample (Taken from the two cops). They even proved that the vile was missing blood! (let's not forget about the blood that appeared on the gates three weeks later). There are photos to prove this.And those drips look pretty precise (as if it were dropped with care). 

**Why did Cato tell investigators that before the murders OJ told him he was going to get burgers and needed money then Cato tagged along and OJ used his own money for the burgers and not the money Cato gave him.**

Not sure about this. But here's a fact: Cato had stated that during their hamburger trip, OJ was in sports attire, including his shoes, which were Nike/Reebok-type running shoes. The shoe prints that were found at the murder scene were Bruno Magli "dress" shoes (if you want to get really technical, those particular shoes had soles, which were attached to over 50 different shoe brands, but that's another story...) If you look at the time line (the McDonalds visit is around this time spectrum....the last thing anyone saw OJ do before the murder took place), why the heck would OJ dress up in dress shoes then go on a killing spree? (it would be the other way around, right?) Also, when you're in a "jealous" rage (immediate nature of rage that occurs before deliberation), would you really be wanting to go for a quick meal, let alone dress up, wear gloves, a knit cap? They were divorced, broken up for months. OJ had a hotter gf and was happy.There are letters of Nicole wanting to get back with OJ. I don't buy the jealous/rage theory. The prosecution and the media planted this in our heads, because it makes good ratings/a good way to give the guy a motive when they never had one. 

**My deal...**

I'm not saying OJ did it. I'm not saying he didn't do it. But the correct answer for everyone should be "I don't know..." Nobody has the right to say anything else. I think there's something hidden deep in this OJ murder thing that'll sadly, never be explained.

One thing I really dislike about the public is they don't look at the facts before speaking. They usually jump to a conclusion after watching Dr. Phil or something. That's what's wrong with society. Everyone hitches the bandwagon instead of actually "thinking" for themselves.

The defense received a bad rap for playing the race card (especially Johnnie's "Hitler" analogy), but when you have a proven racist (the guy even collects Nazi memorabilia "because of its craftsmanship") who found the most damning evidence, race is a factor. In this case, race/fact came into play. 

The jury were no idiots. If I were on the stand, I would have set him free as well (again, I'm Filipino, not black...)

<TITLE> OJ Simpson had taken, and failed, a polygraph test. Here's an explanation... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-03 10:53:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Shortly after Simpson was found not guilty of the murder of Brown and her friend Ron Goldman, longtime Simpson friend Rob Kardashian told ABC's 20/20 that he was shocked to learn that his friend had taken, and failed, a polygraph test. He said at the time that Simpson told him he had flunked the test because he was very emotional.

**Legal professionals seem to agree that this is a common problem with lie detector tests.** The American Psychological Association has even claimed that the science behind polygraphs can be "controversial." Innocent people can sometimes respond like guilty people, depending on how they react under stress and the types of questions asked. Likewise, it is supposedly possible to "beat" lie detector tests if you know how to control your answers and reactions.

<TITLE> Media's misleading statement: Ron Goldman was a "good samaritan" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-03 10:37:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One misleading statement that was repeated a thousand times in the media was that Ron Goldman was a "good samaritan." Here's the truth: Ron Goldman was a drug dealer and became a confidential informant while he was Nicole's boyfriend (or at least one of her boyfriends). 

On the night of the murders, Ron was bringing misplaced sunglasses to his girlfriend. This is how one book describes their relationship: "They exercised and attended dance clubs together, and often met for coffee and meals." Ron was noted as playing with Nicole's kids and walking the dog with her as well. As Nicole's neighbor Beverly Newman put it: "I thought they were married."

Also, on the night of the murders, Nicole had lit candles, drew a bath, put on music and made sure she was scantily clad in dark nglige when Ron arrived. In other words, they were boyfriend and girlfriend (not that there's anything wrong with that  but the media won't tell you that). 

Calling Ron a "good Samaritan" suggested that he was just being nice and had no other reason for being there. This was carefully worded to drive home the lie that Nicole was the target. Saying Ron was "in the wrong place at the wrong time" is a statement that already suggest OJ's guilt (Because if Nicole is a target, that puts OJ at the top of the suspect list). 

The reality is much more likely to be that Ron was followed home to be butchered and that Nicole was in the wrong relationship at the wrong time. How can I say such a thing? For multiple reasons, but let's center on motive, something the prosecution just couldn't get over: the fact that OJ had no motive for these murders. 

OJ was wealthy, dated underwear models, had a good relationship with his ex-wife prior to marrying Nicole. They had both signed a prenuptial agreement that left him relatively unscathed by the divorce. He had an incredibly high "Q" rating and was flying around the country on business trips for Hertz and other lucrative ventures. In other words: it was good to be the "Juice" back then. 

Through the whole trial, the prosecution could never put a coherent motive on the table, not to mention that his own children were upstairs  and we are to believe he left a pool of blood for them to come down and see?  I don't buy it. 


But who would have motive to kill Ron Goldman? (maybe someone who knew he was a confidential informant!?).

<TITLE> The Rampart Scandal in the 90s: LA Police Corruption </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-01 18:13:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "The LAPD Rampart scandal refers to widespread corruption in the Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) anti-gang unit of the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division in the late 1990s. More than 70 police officers either assigned to or associated with the Rampart CRASH unit were implicated in some form of misconduct, making it one of the most widespread cases of documented police misconduct in United States history, responsible for a long list of offenses including unprovoked shootings, unprovoked beatings, planting of false evidence, frameups, stealing and dealing narcotics, bank robbery,perjury, and the covering up of evidence of these activities.

The New Rampart Police Station

The Rampart investigation, based mainly on statements of CRASH officer Rafael Prez, also known as Ray Lopez, an admitted corrupt policeman, initially implicated over 70 officers of wrongdoing. Of those officers, enough evidence was found to bring 58 before an internal administrative board. However, only 24 were actually found to have committed any wrongdoing, with 12 given suspensions of various lengths, 7 forced into resignation or retirement, and 5 terminated.

As a result of the probe into falsified evidence and police perjury, 106 prior criminal convictions were overturned"

When you take it into context, someone had to be aware that this behaviour was ongoing.  And in the back of jurors mind, they got to be thinking, well if cops could frame people in those hundreds of other cases, why not OJ, the cop did admit to framing OJ on tape, so why not?

OJ Simpson Didn't Do It is a new subreddit that will explore facts, theories and other suggestions that explain why the public should keep an open mind about the accused that is Orenthal James Simpson. Sure, the verdict was "not guilty," but to most of the world, he still "did it".

I personally believe OJ is not the killer. I've done a considerable amount of research (unlike 95% of the people out there who are quick to judge after being consumed by the media). However, a part of me does believe that OJ knows something about what really went on the night of the murders. For whatever reason, Simpson most-likely keeps his mouth shut to protect not only himself, but also his family and friends.

For the record, I'm not black (sorry to be so blunt), but I just wanted to point that out, since there's a lot of "all black people think he's innocent" or "the jury was mostly black which is why he was set free" stuff going on. To me, I believe in the truth, which bares no color.
Unless you've thoroughly watched the whole trial and have done some research outside the mainstream media, nobody has the right to say "He did it." Same goes for any other case.

Plain and simple. Still, not the smartest move for OJ (since he agreed), but when you have financial obligations, you do immoral things.  Quote: "Hey, they offered me $600,000 not to dispute that I [wrote] the book." He said, "That's cash." I said, "They're going to think you wrote it." He said, "So?

<TITLE> OJ Simpson DIDN'T Do It? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-31 05:58:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "OJ Simpson Didn't Do It" is a new subreddit that will explore reasons why the the public and media need to keep an open mind about the the accused that is Orenthal James Simpson. Sure, he came out "not guilty" as the verdict, but he's still the "killer" to most of the world. And just for the record, I'm not black. Just wanted to point that out!

And remember, like Edgar Allan Poe says, Believe only half of what you see and nothing that you hear.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The murder of Ron and Nicole was among a string of murders of people associated with O.J., Ron, and Nicole. Casimir Sucharski, a friend of O.J., was murdered two weeks after Ron and Nicole. On March 19, 1995 O.J.'s friend, record company promoter Charles Minor, was murdered. On July 30, 1993, eleven months before the famous double murder, Ron Goldman's friend Brett Cantor was killed with a knife in a manner identical to Ron and Nicole: from behind and across the throat and stabbed repeatedly on the arms and chest. Michael Nigg, a waiter at the Mezzaluna (Ron Goldman was also a waiter there) was shot in the head and killed. Another Mezzaluna waiter barely survived a car bombing.

<TEXT> O.J. trial judge Lance Ito was reportedly in a position to know what the double murders were really all about. His wife, L.A. Police Captain Margaret York, has been in charge of investigating police department corruption. Captain York reportedly knew of the other police brass as the corrupt secret owners/operators of the fast food sites, formerly O.J.'s businesses (Did O.J. still retain an interest?).

<TEXT> Norman Pardo, Simpson's former manager, told the Huffington Post the book was written by a ghostwriter without Simpson's involvement. Rather, Simpson had accepted, against Pardo's advice, $600,000 from the publisher ReganBooks and its parent company NewsCorp to say he had written the book and to conduct an associated TV interview.[3] Pardo told the Huffington Post that Simpson had rationalized:[2]

"Hey, they offered me $600,000 not to dispute that I [wrote] the book." He said, "That's cash." I said, "They're going to think you wrote it." He said, "So? Everybody thinks I'm a murderer anyway. They're not going to change their mind just because of a book."

<TEXT> It only has Lo Meng (from what I remember). And I think for a film to qualify as a "Venoms" film, it has to have 2 or more (I believe) in absolute starring roles. Several films are usually labeled as "Venoms" films, such as "Chinatown Kid," "Heaven and Hell," the "Brave Archer" series, and "Ten Tigers from Kwantung". The reason they're not is because these movies were either vehicles for other actors (i.e. Fu Sheng in "Chinatown Kid"), or they were films with multiple lead actors (i.e. "Ten Tigers from Kwantung"). Otherwise, a film like "Soul Brothers Of Kung Fu" would be a "Venoms" film. hehe But honestly, I've seen "Five Element Ninjas" advertised many times as a "Venoms" film. But for the sake of the article, I just decided to be keep it as real as possible to what a REAL Venoms film is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good points, but...

1. If you're gonna be taking peoples' money/food/asking for donations, have the decency to NOT have a full blown conversation on a phone, while in the process.

2. If you can afford a cell phone (and I understand they're inexpensive), you obviously have some means of income. Besides, she can be paid to hold up a sign just like the one she's holding. </TEXT>

If Yayan had his own "Raid" character poster, that would have been used. And make no mistake, Yayan is a "star" of Raid just as much as anyone else in the movie. And just having Amy Johnston in the headline won't have as much as a pull that listing the other star. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a brief rundown of all the films (just in case someone out there isn't familiar with 'em): 

*Come Drink with Me* (1966): Come Drink With Me is one entertaining film. King Hus direction is top notch. The cinematography is beautiful. The sets are visually lavish. Its innovation and influence reflects many popular martial arts movies of today. Cheng Pei Pei is the real deal  were not sure what it is about her, but she pulls off a believable kung fu fighting babe with grace and style!

*Disciples of the 36th Chamber* (1985): Disciples Of The 36th Chamber is one of the all time best films of the genre! This was essentially the last of the fantastic films to come from director Lau Kar Leung and the amazing cast (Hsiao Ho, Gordon Liu and Lily Li Li Li just to name a few) from the Shaw Brothers. If the time had to come to an end for the most talented cast, this film is an excellent way to say goodbye to the viewers.

*Executioners From Shaolin* (1977): Executioner From Shaolin is one of the quirkier Shaw Brothers movies. What begins as a tale of blood-thirsty revenge slows down to become at times a romantic comedy and domestic drama. But it still has the classic training sequences that you expect from director Lau Kar-leung and one of hell of a bad guy in Pai Mei (Lo Lieh). One of Chen Kuan Tais best!

*Five Shaolin Masters* (1974): Chang Chehs Five Shaolin Masters (David Chiang, Ti Lung, Alexander Fu Sheng, Chi Kuan Chun and Meng Fei) is action-packed from beginning to end. It features the occasional artsy dash, livens up the narrative by splitting up into different storylines, and features great choreography  all of which was overseen by Lau Kar Leung himself.

*Heroes of the East* (1978): You can almost call it The War of the Roses meets Kung Fu with its silly, but smart, plot that revolves around a newlywed couple  a Japanese woman (Yuko Mizuno) and Chinese man (Gordon Liu)  who are constantly challenging each other to prove which is better: Chinese Kung Fu or Japanese Karate/Ninjitsu. A classic from Lau Kar Leung!

*Kid With The Golden Arm* (1978): A fast-paced adventure from director Chang Cheh. Theres not a single dull minute. Insane plotting and many lead characters guarantee youll never know whos going to be killed next, and by who. The spectacular battles are absolutely stunning, especially impressive being of course the final showdown between drunk master Hai To (Kuo Chui) and the high-kicking Iron Feet (not going to tell you who he is).

*Martial Arts of Shaolin* (1986): Lau Kar Leungs emMartial Arts of Shaolin/em is worth a watch for Jet Li fans since you get to see the actor when he was first emerging as a star, fresh-faced and lightning fast. After about 30 minutes of training sequences, the excellently-choreographed battles kick in and rarely let up. Jet gives an earnest, wide-eyed performance and shows off his incredible martial arts skills.

*Shaolin Martial Arts* (1974): In Chang Chehs Shaolin Martial Arts, two Shaolin practioners (Alexander Fu Sheng and Chi Kuan Chung) perfect their kung fu skills to seek revenge on the baddies responsible for wiping out their clan. One of Fu Shengs earliest projects for the Shaw Brothers!

<TEXT> I'm sure it was a marketing choice than anything. This way it would appeal to Chow fans as well? Just my two cents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In *No Retreat No Surrender,* the main character of the film trains with the ghost of Bruce Lee (played by *Game of Death II's* Kim Tai-jong). If you haven't checked out the movie, it's a classic! Corey Yuen's first U.S. film! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess you have a point. There's a lot of kung fu fans out there that love Adkins as a martial arts star. But it looks like he's very limited here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally. The problem with a lot of action/martial arts movies is they forget about the plot. With a good story and some meaningful characters, the action isn't as hard-hitting no matter how good it is. There's no reason a martial arts film can't be quality all-round.  </TEXT>

It's pretty good. I rank it as one of the best Donnie Yen flicks: Ip Man, Wu Xia and Flashpoint!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't want to overwhelm you with a long list, but if you want to see some good stuff with an edge, check out CHASER and YELLOW SEA. Na Hong-jin is my favorite Asian film director at the moment. He's up there with Chan-Wook Park (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance), Kim Jee-woon (I saw the Devil).... by the way, check out a movie called JSA, as well! Hope I helped! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree with Eight Diagram Pole Fighter. One of the best kung fu movies, period! Even despite the production issues (script re-writes because of Fu Sheng's death).  </TEXT>
