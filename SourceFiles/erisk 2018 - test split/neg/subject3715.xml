<TEXT> As I said, the two groups are incredibly stereotypical, but I do believe it covers the majority of Android users. 

There are literally hundred of millions of users who do not fit into the categories. By far the majority of Android phones sold are very cheap, almost feature phones not flagship products. And the people who choose the Flagship Products is almost exclusively highly technical people who wishes more control over their experience (Myself included). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess my definition of afford is wrong, English not being my first language. I mean afford in the context of being able to buy without feeling the need to justify it.

E.g. people who can actually afford to buy a Mercedes do not feel like they need to justify it. It's just the car they choose to buy in their affordability bracket.

Edit just checked, looks like the definition of afford is [*to be able to do, manage, or bear without serious consequence or adverse effect*](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/afford) E.g. if you feel like you need to justify it, you can't afford it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can roughly break android users into two distinct segments:

1. People who are incredibly technically capable who wishes full control over their mobile experience.
2. People who cannot afford an iPhone

While this is an ultra simplistic way of looking at the market, it's true for at-least for the industry I work in (Mobile Games).

**[Edit]**
For clarification I said *roughly* even assuming that the above is only true for 80% of Android users, that still leaves ~400 million Android users who choose Android for other reasons.

As /u/jama211 [points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5u6jzj/iphone_owners_are_about_21_times_more_likely_to/ddrubsj/) iOS users simply use more money on their phone and are therefore worth more to app developers, including our company.

One way we make money in our games is via advertisement. Advertisement these days is sold using high frequency actions where advertisers bids on every single ad view. Just doing a quick look at what we are paid for 1000 US ad-views we get:

* Android: $0.61
* iOS: $1.94

Most advertisers are clever and work with fixed profit margins. So by the above numbers an iOS user is worth a bit more than 3x what an Android user is worth. 

I will leave it up to you guys to decide if this is a result of iOS users being worse at money mangement or because they have more disposable income. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey /r/basketball, I am an indie developer who just released a very simple basketball game at:

http://basketball.frvr.com/

I would really like your feedback! The game is 100% free to play and works on both web and mobile.

So, a few questions I would love to have answered from true fans:

1. Are you more likely to play the game because it's basketball themed?
2. Is the gameplay experience acceptable, even though the gameplay is fairly fare away from a true simulation.
3. What would make you recommend this game, or a game like it to fellow basketball fans?

Full disclosure: posting this here, I naturally hope that all of you like the game and plays it :) </TEXT>

The resulting success of you sharing the game has allowed me to build games full time ever since!

So here is my latest game [Basketball FRVR](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1185836177). Similarly to Hex FRVR it's not particularly complex, but did my very best to make it addictive. All in all I ended up spending more time playing the game than actually making. Oops.

<TEXT> It's getting harder and harder to be an indie as platforms becomes established. 

Typically when a new platform goes live Indies takes the chance and jumps onboard, then over time the platform matures and only people with huge marketing budgets have the means to become successful on said platform.

So, if you like indie games look at less established platforms, or platforms where few are trying to compete. Currently you should be able to find amazing inde HTML5, VR and Desktop (itch.io, gog, etc)

An interesting segment I can't figure out why more Indies are not targeting is Facebook Desktop games. There is literrally still billions to be made on this platform, but everyone seems to like Mobile so much more.

<TEXT> Hey /r/games a bit more than a year ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3o43f8/what_started_out_as_a_test_ended_up_as_a_crazy/) [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) and Reddit loved it. The resulting success of you sharing the game has allowed me to build games full time ever since!

So here is my latest game [Basketball FRVR](http://basketball.frvr.com). Similarly to Hex FRVR it's not particularly complex, but did my very best to make it addictive. All in all I ended up spending more time playing the game than actually making. Oops.

My personal best is 71. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As with the sensor, the display medium also typically only support Red Green Blue colours. There is simply not enough people with tetrachromats to make it worth making a monitor or printer that can print in the 370nm spectrum.

When that is said, I would assume people do not test for it either. Therefore it's fair to assume that people with tetrachromats can be more or less happy with diffrent screens based on if they leak 370nm spectrum light or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are good at reading guidelines you can write and file a provisional patent application yourself for nothing more than the filling fees ($130).

With that in hand you can approach the existing developers of drop weight stringers with a preposition for them to licence your idea for either a fixed cost or percentage fee per unit sold. (Most will want to buy your idea outright, but often it's better to get longterm revenue by getting a licensing fee perpetually)

When you then have an agreement in place with a manifacturer you can complete the filling, would typically cost $10k+ total. [More here](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/04/04/the-cost-of-obtaining-a-patent-in-the-us/id=56485/)

This is basically how most small time inventors are able to work without having existing huge capital resources.

While I have never done this, I have friends who have. The primary key to success is to come across as someone who know exactly what they are doing. You want to highlight that your a mechanical engineer. Likewise you want to introduce yourself as a "product developer" rather than an inventor.

Best of luck!

<TEXT> Learn to code, it will give you a leg up in any tech heavy company. Even if you at simply going the AQ route, having rudementery understanding of what is going on will make your work a lot better.

Likewise it's 100% free to learn online and requires nothing but a computer to work on. 

There is also quite a good carrier to be had by making smaller games for niche markets. Look into indie development / companies. These might even be an option for you already. They can't compete with the salaries of the big guys, but they should be able to keep up with what you are earning now and the job will be a lot more fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Late 2011 MacBook Pro (before retina was a thing), upgraded with 16gb ram and Samsung 512gb SSD. It does everything, virtual computers, Xcode, front end and server development.

Currently waiting for a 15" 2016 MacBook with all the checkboxes checked. 

Looking at the numbers I should see a 30-50% better CPU, 12x better memory performance and 100x better disk performance. I expect to be blown away with how fast it is.

My main worry is that 16gb ram is low for a computer I expect to use for 4+ years and that I will dislike the butterfly keyboard. I also expect that I will miss the non glossy screen. </TEXT>

If you are conspiratorial you could even convince yourself that Apple is pushing the announcement of this device until people already bought the MacBook, such that people see it as an individual purchase rather than the total price of MacBook + Screen combo. </TEXT>

* [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xt8x885oyutke9m/FramePNG-fs8-z.png?dl=0) is a visually indistinguishable PNG file @ 212kb (34% of original)
* [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kl39d6l9au9jnfy/FramePNG-fs8-z2.png?dl=0) is a ever so slightly diffrent PNG (see the colours on the screen) @ 166.7kb (26.7% of original)

There are also substantially better lossless formats than PNG.

* [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lcfnz1v1p0aqnvp/FramePNG.flif?dl=0) is is a 100% identical [FLIF](http://flif.info) file @ 373.9kb (60% of original)

Here is a [nice little graph](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=frvr) showing how users interact with the brand. The spike is Hex FRVR going live.

As for raw numbers, monthly searches for just "FRVR" directly results in:
* ~7000 Web users

<TEXT> The game should absolutely not freeze nor textures fail to load. Did you install the app or are you simply playing the web version?

As for getting 100k+ scores, focus on always having two possible moves after the tile you just did. As you get better at that focus on creating 3+ line combos to get there quicker. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lot's of people have been blaming me for making the game harder the more they play. Honestly I do, people just get stuck in bad patterns while playing.

So a big unconditional thank you!

Today I finally released version 3.0.0 with translations to 30 languages, new skins, better mobile versions, bug fixes and much, much more! I truly hope you enjoy it.

Happy to answer any questions you might have and would love ideas and feedback for version 4.0.0 :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's single threaded, you have 12 cores in, assuming nothing else than the benchmark ran you should see 8.3% CPU usage due to your beefy CPU.

When that is said, single core performance is quite important as most unspecialised tasks are typically single threaded due to the complexity of building multi threaded applications. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Using Geekbench 4, single threaded, we can see that [your computer](https://browser.primatelabs.com/processor-benchmarks) scores 3549. Comparing that to the old iPhone [iOS benchmarks](https://browser.primatelabs.com/ios-benchmarks) (no iPhone 7 yet) we can see that the A9 in the iPhone scores 2400. Give that a ~40% increase in performance we get ~3360 as expected score for the A10/iPhone 7.

Assuming the A10x gets the same performance improvements as the A10 you should expect the next iPad Pro to be about 20% faster than your desktop computer for single threaded applications.

On the plus side, your desktop CPU will still kick it's ass for multithreaded applications.

<TEXT> **Submission statement**

This experiment, and those of contemporaries like Louis Pasteur, confirmed that many diseases are caused by microscopic organisms. Microbes, which had been largely neglected for a couple of centuries, were quickly cast as avatars of death. They were germs, pathogens, bringers of pestilence. Within two decades of Kochs work on anthrax, he and many others had discovered that bacteria were also associated with leprosy, gonorrhoea, typhoid, tuberculosis, cholera, diphtheria, tetanus, and plague. Microbes became synonymous with squalor and sickness. They became foes for us to annihilate and repel. Today, we know this view is wrong... </TEXT>

On Apple nothing is required but they do generally care about their new features and initiatives, but it's just a multiplier on your chances, your game still needs to be good. Go implement with the Apple Watch, Replay Kit, or similar to increase your chance currently. Likewise, remember it's humans on the other end, they will be influenced by description, art, music, etc. Do what you can here to get an edge, such as embedding an image in the email to Apple and link to a video of gameplay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oki, you are looking at a fairly young audience then. Closer to my [Hex Game](http://hex.frvr.com) than my [Solitaire](http://solitaire.frvr.com) and [Mahjong Games](http://mahjong.frvr.com/alc/).

**For those your primary install sources are going to be**

* Getting featured, yes this is possible. Even crazier is that people typically get their first Apple feature by simply emailing appstorepromotion@apple.com (Yes people actually read that thing)
* Social sharing, if you look at games in your category, social sharing is how the game becomes super big. Make it easy for people to share on Twitter, Sina Weibo etc.


**Paid acquisition**

* For this type of game, this is a perfectly valid strategy, but only if the social sharing component work. E.g. if you on average get 4-5 installs per paid user. A great way to test this is to go crazy in a under performing territory. For Denmark + Island for instance I was able to bring [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) to #1 app by spending less than $1000 on each.
* For larger markets, you want to use paid advertisement as a booster. If the game is going viral in an area, use your money to boost that virility. I did this in for  [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) in Taiwan, where I moved the app from #5 to #1 in the iOS app store, again for less than $1000 USD.
* Facebook ads, Facebook ads, Facebook ads. Ad your budget level, this is pretty much the only source that is likely to work for you.

**Other feedback**

* Add an easy to compare level of measuring success. Games for younger audiences are typically driven by competition. Getting to 2048, having the highest flappy birds score, etc.
* Make sure your game is easy to find in the App Stores, preferably with a one keyword search. E.g. AA, 2048, Flappy etc.

* You get 25 points for removing any set of points
* You get a bonus for clearing the board with tiles left over. First tile is 50 points, second is 100, third is 150 and so on.

To get the best score, simply complete the game with as many tiles left over as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I implemented a function that given a seed always returns the same sequence of pseudo random numbers. I then use the current day offset as the seed and feed the random numbers into a custom level generator that creates resonantly good mahjong level geometry. 

As for the tiles, I randomize those when you restart a level (to ensure people don't get stuck) by simply randomly removing two tiles at a time to the board is cleared, and assigning them the same random tile face.

As my heuristics for generating the random level geometry is a bit specific, and the amount of tiles on the board is limited, I actually only have about 235000 unique levels. I did however ensure players will not get the same level inside a sequence of 1000 levels, so you will have to play more than two years back before risking seeing your first repeat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should not have issues getting approved for google Adsense as long as your banners are not in easy click distance from UI elements. I don't know how much volume you have yet, but if you are getting into the millions of DAU's you should apply for [google ads for games](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1705831?hl=en). [LiveStreetMedia](http://www.lifestreet.com) has a pretty neat display network for this type of content.

Likewise as you have a shop you could use reward videos as an alternative to payment "pay now or watch video" alike. Take a look at supersonic.

Also I could totally see roTopo game do well on mobile. Although you should smoothen the tutorial such that it skips levels if you play perfectly. I found it to easy up to the very end and would not have continued if I was not playing it after stalking your comment history.

It really needs a UI design refresh though, it's confusing and very programmer art alike, very much not something the audience who plays this type of puzzle game likes. Your inspirations should be monument valley, two dots, three, alphabear etc.

As of today it would be pretty fair to simply divide the total amount of hours spend on development equally among the games.

I spend 814 hours and 9 minutes writing code +- a few seconds. Making the development effort per game 280 hours or 35.4 man days of work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great question and not rude at all! There is multiple answers to that question.

1. I really like puzzle games myself. I casually joke that I am a 45 year old american woman inside. 
2. I find the activities involved with building a company rewarding. Releasing the games, seeing users flow in, doing marketing, PR, etc. 
3. I take great pride in polishing the games, making sure it lives up to peoples expectations.
4. It's still pretty fun to code, beats doing websites any day.
5. The games are still very much my own. It's like saying your new car is not yours because it's not unique.

Lastly, I also do unique games such as Hex FRVR and there are more of that type of content in the plans down the line. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep better user hooks is very much on the todo, highscores, leaderboards, unlockables, etc. Right now it's a balance between value from making more games and value from improving the back catalogue. For now I believe there is more value in creating a few more games.

A huge amount of people have asked me to publish their game. However for something like that to work they would basically have to build the games on-top of the FRVR platform as my strategies will will not work well without the distributability of FRVR games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was referring to their ability to run WebGL in the mobile browser. A lot of my users come from people playing the web version on their phone, then installing the full app.

This is where the engine size comes in as well. Application size from something in the app store is not super important. However when people share a link to the game, you want the game playable ASAP. 

All my games are playable and running after loading less than 400kb of data. Giving me an average load time of just [below 3 seconds](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ck1n3gbide806i/Screenshot%202016-07-02%2017.18.03.png?dl=0). In tests I losse about 10% of users for every extra second the content take to load. People really do not have any attention span. This is also why I dump people directly into the game, rather than showing them a menu screen.

In short, Unity3D is not ready for the kind of web games I do, I wish it was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Using a game engine is a really good idea. Quite honestly you should never be writing a game engine yourself. [I talk at length about this here](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/107990203647/manning-up-and-taking-my-own-advice). However now where I do have the resources to pay other people to do it, it's quite reasonable to get something build just for FRVR.
2. [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) was original.... until all the clones kicked in. However it just so happens that game mechanics cannot be [copyrighted](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/273935/Texas_court_affirms_game_mechanics_not_protected_under_copyright_law.php). This is a good thing btw, otherwise the gaming world would be dominated by the EA's and King.com's of the world. For something like Solitaire and Mahjong, those games pre-date the internet and even computers, so even if there was a copyright it's long expired by now.
3. I just wrote the website in vanilla HTML.
4. For the first half year of FRVR I had a full time job paying my bills. Likewise I saved up for 2 years to be able to quit without being particularly worried. Likewise, something like FRVR can relatively easily be build during a few hours every night.  It helps that I watch very little television.
5. Not really no, my work here is based on years of experience with game development and javascript. (My first real job was to build multiplayer javascript games. This was in 1999 before HTML5, Firefox, Chrome and pretty much anything that makes the internet what it is today.)

[Edit] As for Unity3D the WebGL support they have would not fit my needs. Their core library is about 3x the size of my entire games including art and music. Even worse their exports do not work on Mobile. It will likely be fine in 4-5 years when phones are faster and Unity's exporter is better. But for now I get to have a bit of a competitive advantage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your seeing things :P

Here is the randomiser code in all it's glory. You get easier to use tiles when your score is low and the game becomes slightly harder as you score rises.

    var rnd = scoreValue*Math.random()
    if(rnd10000    Math.random().5){
    	//Less than 10k All except two evil (50% of the time).
    	type = Math.random()*(tileConfig.length-2)0
    }else if(rnd50000){
    	// 10k Add in half moon tile
    	type = (Math.random()*(tileConfig.length-1)0)
    }else if(rnd100000){
    	// 50k Cut out the 1 tile
    	type = (Math.random()*(tileConfig.length-2)0)+1
    }else{
    	// 100k Add Cross tile
    	type = (Math.random()*(tileConfig.length-1)0)+1
    }

Your just getting better at the game. </TEXT>

As of today it would be pretty fair to simply divide the total amount of hours spend on development equally among the games.

I spend 814 hours and 9 minutes writing code +- a few seconds. Making the development effort per game 280 hours or 35.4 man days of work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ideas are a dime a dozen, it's all in the execution. If you are an execution guy you could deconstruct my business model from observation in a few days anyway. My hope is to motivate more people to get going - likewise the market I operate in is hyper saturated already, one or two more players are going to do nothing to my chances of success.

Well that totally depends on conversion rate, price per game etc. It's very likely I would have done better by now with a paid mobile app. I have about 1.5m installs in total. Had I managed to get about 12% of that to pay $.99 I would have made the same amount of money in total. However it would be a much more hit driven business where I would be dependent on cranking out games frequently. I like passive stable income a lot more.

<TEXT> 1. The majority of revenue comes from mobile ads. I have indeed considered other revenue streams but is very carefull to not alienate my userbase. All of FRVR is focused on long term growth, making money now is less important than making money over the next 10 years. For instance I do not run video ads, nor do I show ads to new users playing the games. While I do allow people to disable the ads with a micro transaction (about $2k of revenue I forgot to report in the blog post), I don't believe the quality and complexity of the game is good enough to charge for. 
2. Mobile is such a better eco system. People already have their credit card on file and Apple/Google has done an amazing job of educating users that it's ok to pay for digital content. I am on the tail end of that, having users that can be moved into better paying games. In the long run you could imagine FRVR building some high quality paid games and using the potential ad traffic to directly monetise the user. This could increase revenue 3-4x but is currently out of scope.
3. It's a risk reward consideration. Look at Solitaire on the blog graph. It's low revenue but incredibly stable. That's the kind of revenue I want right now (I want 10+ of such). Stable, dependable, long-term.
4. Yes, I believe (Untested assumption) that for my type of games it's a waste of time. I want less interaction with the users not more. This is also a big reason I do not do paid games, as it comes with a huge overhead in fraud   support.

I will take free distribution any day, even if it does not directly generate revenue. Hosting is a fractional cost these days and it's still [building the brand](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=frvr). You are so much better off being everywhere than trying to be monopolistic - the exception is of-couse people who straight up steal the game or parts thereof. (I have taken down more than 200 mobile apps that did this to date) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the in-depth, [annotated list of the tools I use to build FRVR](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/136256124252/the-tools-i-use).

As for initial traction, it's all web based by old Flash websites that now also distribute HTML5 games. Try [this Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22mahjong+frvr%22) and see how many websites already carry the game. Most of the sites have minimal traffic, but together it's substantial (10k DAU+).

Likewise, I try to release everywhere the kind of user who will play my game exist. E.g. it would make little sense for me to release on steam.

The success of Hex FRVR was pretty huge for me, it grew the game from ~$50/day to about ~$150 a day pretty early on in the release of the game. However it dwindles in compared to the game going viral on Chinese twitter clones. That's when the game shot about 1k USD / day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pixi was a quick way for me to gain easy WebGL usage with good canvas fallback. However in the latest Pixi releases the canvas fallback has become less and less a priority for the engine. This is really concerning to me as major handset operators in china such as Xiaomi are still selling handsets without WebGL support in the millions.

Likewise drawing a vein diagram of what Pixi can do and what we really want to be able to do we only get about 85% overlap. I would really like to dip into some 3d embellishments for card flipping but I have no need for the way Pixi handles high DPI screens.

Overall Pixi is 100% the right choice for someone starting out but as with any tool you might end up outgrowing it.

An important note here -- It's more about the distribution than the game. You can still do the games you want to do, you just really need to understand where to find the users for it.

One smart thing I did was write a small script that scraped google for smaller game sites, then hired a guy on upwork.com to collect contact information from the sites. This list today has more than 5000 emails and as people reply I move it over into the verified contact list.

No I do not make any money from the web versions of the games. They do however aggressively promote the mobile versions, see for instance the sidebar. </TEXT>

* iFrame embeds from 2291 unique domains (I allow my games to be embedded into 3rd party websites - [Example](http://www.gamesgames.com/game/mahjong-frvr))
* Social sharing (The game is easy to share as it's just an url)

The only exception to this is the Facebook apps as Facebook do send huge amounts of free organic traffic to high recency content (which my games are).

Likewise I have taken a lot of choices focusing on increasing longevity of users rather than immediate monetisation.

* No video ads (Would likely increase revenue with up to 100%)
* No ads are shown to new users for about 30 minutes (It's better to have a user return than make money right now)

Money is generated by pure volume. I do about 2.2MAU/170DAU, in that context I make almost nothing compared to some of my competitors. However for me it's all about the long game, building a big userbase that are addicted to a large set of core FRVR games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hex FRVR is a unique FRVR production. For Solitaire and Mahjong it's known pre internet board games, implemented by me. Part of my strategy is to build the core set of classical games, Solitaire's, Mahjong's, Sudoku's, etc. then expand into more creative games when I have a solid userbase to self promote to.

While not anywhere near as cool as many of the game projects here, it is a much safer way to build a business. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2) Yea for levels you already played it's a non issue

3) It should be fairly easy to re-introduce, I will play with it. A interesting note here is that you actually do not even need to rotate the tiles. You simply need to re-arrange them.

As for payment vs ads, I mostly introduced the option because people kept complaining about them. However for heavy users I believe it's a better business for me to keep the ads, but I just could not get myself to make it more expensive. (For someone playing for years, I would need to charge $10+ to break even).

Also I decided against the recommendation of disabling the game when the ads are not loading. So if you are using a ad blocker or have no internet, there will be no ads but the game will still play. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Games you already completed stays unlocked forever (You have an increasing amount of unlocked levels)

2) I will look into this, it is however a bit computationally heavy as I use a bunch of math to generate the individual levels, rather than hand making them.

3) I originally had this, but it feels really strange when tiles un-luck in the wrong direction (From bottom and top, rather than the sides). Likewise the game is not the same if the tiles are unlocked from the sides. I am thinking of releasing another mahjong game, simply to also have a portrait mode gameplay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah yea, a good time based lock stepped physics simulation that runs similar on server and client will get you really far. 

Be aware that you might get small changes in the simulation due to diffrent processors doing floating points slightly differently.

The fun stuff is then compensating for other players lag using interpolation between updated coordinates and actual coordinates. [this should help](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/fpm3.html)

<TEXT> macOS. As I currently work in HTML5/WebGL, having a native Safari browser and the tools to export to iOS in my OS is a huge advantage for me over Windows / Linux. 

However the initial reason I switched to max was the hardware Macbook Pros offered in the early 2010's over windows laptops. I was sure I was going to dual boot into windows all the time. I just never really had a reason to.

With windows getting the Linux command like, giving me access to all the tools I have grown accustom to. I might actually take a second look at Windows.

Biggest downside for me currently is that I need to use a online service to test in IE / Edge.

Major sources of current traffic is our own cross promotion between our previous two games, our website (frvr.com) and a few 3rd party games websites, iframing the game into their site.

<DATE> 2016-06-27 22:34:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone, I just officially released the 3rd game under the FRVR Brand.

* HTML5: http://mahjong.frvr.com
* Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frvr.mahjong
* iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1100087485

While not the most excitingly unique game, I believe it's one of the best versions of Mahjong Solitaire that can be played both in a browser and installed as an app.
Feedback is super welcome and highly appreciated.

<TEXT> While the way it was said rubs me the wrong way, let's talk about this for a bit. While it can sound stupid, you can actually have difference in per pixel quality. Here is a few examples that comes to mind:

* Refresh rate (You guys are all about this)
* Antialiasing (Fewer rough edges)
* Better resampling - (Fewer texture artifacts - [here's gifs from Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/ivm/HQMPIR/tilted_rotate/animated_chirp.htm))
* Color depth (Tweaking colors to make thing look better, think HDR etc)
* Render consistency. (How many artifacts are created when you move the camera. This is very important for VR where you have the same scene rendered with a slight offset) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote some code to draw the [FRVR](http://frvr.com) logo in 2.2Kib pre-compressed JavaScript (1108 bytes after gZip).
http://codepen.io/subject3715/pen/RRwqRK

The goal being to save HTTP request and as many bytes as possible when showing our games preloader.

The original data is a SVG file which is processed trough a custom compressor I wrote specifically for the purpose. However the compressor/drawing method can be re-used, and we do expect to move other simple assets into the JS going forward.

The initial goal was to decrease load time of our games, as much as possible, by shaving off HTTP requests. Even better we found that the actual total binary size is substantially smaller as well! E.g. the FRVR logo takes up 16139 bytes after running it though pngquant.

First game to make use of this is [Mahjong FRVR](http://mahjong.frvr.com) which is fully playable after 368KB and 16 HTTP requests total. (Music and sounds load asynchronously afterwards) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Damn, I see from the other comment that sum mod 6 was a valid solution. Was so proud to derive that myself. 

But why on earth does that work? To understand that let's look at the chance of the sum being each number between 1 and 16 and what that returns after mod 6.

    Value:  3 Chance: 0.46%  Mod 6 = 4
    Value:  4 Chance: 1.38%  Mod 6 = 5
    Value:  5 Chance: 2.77%  Mod 6 = 6
    Value:  6 Chance: 4.62%  Mod 6 = 1
    Value:  7 Chance: 6.94%  Mod 6 = 2
    Value:  8 Chance: 9.72%  Mod 6 = 3
    Value:  9 Chance: 11.58% Mod 6 = 4
    Value: 10 Chance: 12.50% Mod 6 = 5
    Value: 11 Chance: 12.50% Mod 6 = 6
    Value: 12 Chance: 11.58% Mod 6 = 1
    Value: 13 Chance: 9.72%  Mod 6 = 2
    Value: 14 Chance: 6.94%  Mod 6 = 3
    Value: 15 Chance: 4.62%  Mod 6 = 4
    Value: 16 Chance: 2.77%  Mod 6 = 5
    Value: 17 Chance: 1.38%  Mod 6 = 6
    Value: 18 Chance: 0.46%  Mod 6 = 1

Now let's sum the chance of getting each mod result

    Mod 1 = 4.62% + 11.58% + 0.46%
    Mod 2 = 6.94% + 9.72%
    Mod 3 = 9.72% + 6.94%
    Mod 4 = 0.46% + 11.58% + 4.62%
    Mod 5 = 1.38% + 12.5%  + 2.77%
    Mod 6 = 2.77% + 12.5%  + 1.38%

Lo and behold, they all sum up to 16.66% or 1/6, showing why sum mod 6 is a valid solution.

It looks like you made an image post with a link in the post text. If that is the case the image is considered the target content. So basically 102 people clicked the image to see it in a large version.

The propper way would be to make a post as a Facebook Page to the page itself using the short url as the target content. Then replace the image with whatever image you want to appear (E.g. your shoes in this case)

Here is a screenshot of how it will look if setup right

<TEXT> Hey /r/taiwan, I am a one man indie game developer who is hoping you can help me out!. My game [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) us currently getting increasingly popular in Taiwan and I have no idea why. While I have tried buying a few Facebook ads to further increase the games popularity, the vast majority of users seem to come from other sources.

Anyone knows if the game is popular on social media or something similar? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey r/Apple - I had no idea you have such an amazing weekly thread! What an amazing initiative for small developers like myself. Two thumbs up and all that!

My latest game has been shared a few times on reddit already, but here it is again [Hex FRVR](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1036010745) -- For the lazy who want to play before downloading you can play in your mobile browser here http://hex.frvr.com

Am am currently putting the latest touches on my new game, and hope to be able to post about it here shortly.

As always feedback is very welcome and encouraged :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have personally felt this is true for a few years. As much as I like my Apple devices, the quality of the user experience seems to be dropping.

This is especially true for the + sized iPhone devices where the larger screen integration feels very clunky.

When that is said, it's still at a point where I prefer iOS over Android however ever much I have tried to switch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For now a few things.

* I travel full-time so sticking to a schedule to work with someone else would put some limits on my travel flexibility.
* I already outsource quite a lot of work that I am either bad at or I find repetitive. E.g. Art/Music creation and things such as information gathering etc.
* I am not the best of delegating work, so at-least initially it would take me quite a bit to get things running smoothly with a classical assistant.

However, when that is said, I am already looking at streamlining the process for taking in one or more people to help out in something that resembles a mutually beneficial apprenticeship situation. E.g. I teach something everything I know, while they help grow FRVR. In return I pay their expenses and in the long run they get a permanent revenue share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am trying to build a [one man, passive income, indie games company](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/94738198525/lets-make-a-hobby-startup). Have two games on the market that combined generates somewhere between [$600-$800](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/132895141632/hobby-startup-kpi-update-8) / day, depending on the day. (My monthly fixed cost in running the thing is about $500 or so, including everything except my man hours)

I spend ~900man hours total so far (That's about 5 months of full-time work for anyone counting). Likewise I am still working on expanding with more games and more platforms supported, so not exactly passive in the sense most people think. It does however give me the freedom to travel the world, working from anywhere that have internet. And each game are essentially passive income when they are released.

[I attribute a fair amount of my current success to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/3y68ip/how_reddit_made_my_simple_puzzle_game_an_indie/)

My [initial goal was an avg of ~$822/day](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/94740071350/back-of-the-napkin-revenue-numbers), but I will be re-defining that to to ~$2738/day to force me to focus on overall growth, rather than just releasing a few more games.

[Edit:]

I've done similar things before. Most notably I made a multiplayer level editor in Flash called Everybody Edits that peaked at about $25k/Month revenue. (Was much more costly to run though). [Here is a talk on the entire thing fairly early in the games life](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/94740721865/with-casual-connect-starting-tomorrow-my-real-job)

I also ran Barcodepedia.com for a few years, simply being a website that had had information on barcodes along with a webcam based barcode scanner I wrote in flash. It did about $200 / Month from Google Ads fairly consistently. Quite interesting as all the traffic was from google itself. </TEXT>

As for porting to mobile, I was using Cordova, but recently [replaced it with a custom solution](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/131920929742/replacing-cordova) as I was dissatisfied with the community / code quality of Cordova.

The custom solutions are essentially for purpose WebView wrappers with my own optimisations and integrations, written in Swift and Java.  </TEXT>

* What platform are you playing on? (Android / iOS)
* What version of OS?
* Where in the world are you
* Does it go away if you go into flight mode?
* Do you have any form of ad-blocking software installed
* When does it appear? When you start a new game or just out of the blue?

Thanks a lot!

<TEXT> Here is a tip, r/Gaming adhere quite strictly to the reddiquette. 

This is the relevant paragraph: *Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror  you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.*

As long as you stay inside that ratio, r/Gaming mods won't just allow you to share your game there, they are quite supportive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a few reasons, which I have actually never tested.

* Distributing a free game is easier, what I do not make per user I make up for in volume.
* Having two versions, fracture your app store listing and makes it less likely to get into the toplists (This might actually be a good thing some-times because you get two chances to show your app in the organic listings.)
* I still allow people to disable ads with a payment. It does not perform that well and my impression is that people would rather save the money and deal with the ads. </TEXT>

Doing so gave me a way to measure if what I was currently working on was actually worth it. Likewise, it gave me a way to rank the things I could be working on based on what has the highest impact on my company right now. This was a great tool to make sure I actually got something online, instead of getting stuck in details or over ambitious engineering efforts.

1) They are random, your seeing things :)

2) There are not combos with colors yet, but it's a good idea.

3) Yep, levels I have considered, but had to get it in there without breaking how easy the game is to approach currently.

4) There are on iOS, Google Play services are delayed as they require achievements, something I don't want to do without doing it really well.

<TEXT> Historically I used Cordova to wrap my HTML5 games. (Cordova is the underlying tech for PhoneGap as well). However I got fedt up with with the quality of code of the project and the total lag of official support for major API's such as Facebook, AdMob etc. A good example of just how horrible the community is, is that the most popular AdMob plugin, straight up steals 2% of the advertisement views from you. A fact that they [hide away quite deep](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro/blob/master/docs/README.md) into their documentation.

As for code quality, here is a [nice graph](https://i.imgur.com/byuDJo0.png) of daily crashes, the gray bars are when I release new version. Guess when I replaced Cordova? 

I really want to like Cordova, I think the idea is great and that the team behind it is on the right track. However for now, I would not recommend it in anything more complex than a wrapped website. (Think pizza delivery)

What I ended up doing is defining a custom FRVR integration API then have that wrapped for each platform. For Android Java was chosen, for iOS Swift. However due to the abstraction, it's now easy for me to add more platforms or flavors (Other Android stores). So expect to see Hex FRVR pretty much anywhere apps can go over the next 2-3 months as more native wrappers are added. (Here's the [Google Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hex-frvr/kibjffjfmagcmicpmogpieelngkcfggn) version)

<TEXT> Honestly it was a safe bet. While not unique, it's a game people will keep playing pretty much perpetually. If you look at the latest [revenue report](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/132895141632/hobby-startup-kpi-update-8), you will see that Solitaire now constitute a fixed revenue source for me. Exactly the kind of passive income I would like for FRVR. 

For games such as solitaire, you need to create a product that lives up to people's expectations and not much more. From there your success is defined by your ability to distribute and market your games. Also, I actually really do enjoy puzzle games of this type, having spend substantially more hours playing more solitaire than MMO's or FPS' even though I am a 34 year old guy.

Is it easy to find an audience? Yes. It is however pretty hard actually getting your game in-front of the right user as you have literally thousands of other competitors. I would not recommend going in this direction, unless you have some angle on how to get your game out there. (Here Reddit will not help, trust me I tried ;)) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hex FRVR is my second game, the first being a simple [Klondike Solitaire](http://solitaire.frvr.com) released with the express purpose to experiment with what platforms that work and which do not.

From Solitaire FRVR I learned that 80% of the revenue comes from advertisement in the mobile apps. However I also learned that getting mobile installs via the mobile channels are pretty much impossible unless you are very good friends with Apple and Google for features (Which I am not yet).

However I managed to confirm a big hope of mine. Namely that web is a perfect distribution platform, if you make games that can be easily played in a browser both on web and mobile. Doing so allow easy social sharing and by having self-advertisement for the mobile versions when playing on a mobile device, I can drive quite a lot of free mobile installs.

I therefore for Hex initially focused on Web + Google Play + iTunes App Store. However the success of Hex has now given me access to more exclusive distribution channels such as major 3rd party app stores (Both us and Asia), which I will be exploring over the next months.

I track social installs quite well and have done experimentation with mobile app installs. Reddit, Sina Weibo, Facebook and similar social source have directly resulted in more than 200k installs of Hex. To put that in perspective that would have cost at-least $50k to buy them using classical install advertisement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's some really good questions, let me work on a blog post to answer just those tomorrow. As for quick questions, I made the basic Hex FRVR art myself in Adobe Photoshop, sourced the icon from 99designs.com. I code in Sublime Edit 2 using a custom games engine written on-top of a fork of Pixi.js (Similar to how Photon.js is build on top of Pixi.JS but with my own improvements)

I also rely heavily on 3rd party web services to run FRVR as a company. [Here is a quick screenshot of my dashboard](http://imgur.com/apcLUud). I have been making games and games related stuff since 1999 and can truly say that these services now replace 2-4 people I would normally need to get things done historically. Especially around engineering and Analytics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I have come to realise that Hex is actually a really good game, I still hold that it was the sheer size of Reddit and specifically r/Gaming that really made the game. While subsequently I have gotten a fair amount of organic downloads due to the games ratings, it was the power of Reddit to push an app into the app store toplist that did the difference.

Also, thanks! I take your comment as a huge compliment on my game. Comments like that makes me want to sit down and make the next game right now. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How Reddit made my simple puzzle game an indie developer success. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-25 11:42:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is a [cross post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3y2ela/hey_reddit_thanks_to_you_my_latest_game_is_a/) from /r/gaming with more information added in for you guys.

**TL;DR of below:** About two months ago I shared [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3o43f8/what_started_out_as_a_test_ended_up_as_a_crazy/) to r/Gaming about [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) and the game instantly took off, peaking at more than 5500 concurrent online. Reddit made my game huge and turned me into a successful indie developer. 

[**Play the game**](http://hex.frvr.com), or read on for a story on the power of Reddit!

For more than a year, I have been working on building a [HTML5 games startup](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/94738198525/lets-make-a-hobby-startup). Initially while having a full-time job, working in my spare time. However in July, after having saved up for a year, [I quit my job](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/123727342642/and-for-my-next-trick-ill-be-unemployed) to Travel the world while working on FRVR 2-3 days a week. 

While I did have a fairly well defined path to success, I was quite sure it was going to be a long hard grind, releasing somewhere between 8-10 games before having a really good business. However a single reddit post was enough to completely change that.

Before I shared Hex FRVR I was quite proud of my previous daily record of 31k visitors. On the day I shared the game, I reached 182k unique visitors and as people kept sharing the game, I eventually peaked at 410k daily visitors a few days later! These days the daily amount of players have stabilised at around 170k. [Here is a graph](https://imgur.com/7d4IlKj)

While that is amazing by itself, it's pretty clear that the gaming press reads Reddit (Hi!) as the game was quickly picked up by [CNET](http://www.cnet.com/news/hex-frvr-set-to-become-the-new-2048/), [PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/hex-frvr-the-perfect-procrastination-puzzle-game/), [Venture Beat](http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/14/meet-hex-frvr-the-new-puzzle-game-thatll-take-over-your-life/), and many more (Anyone wants a full list?)

Most importantly, the sheer volume of traffic made the game an economic success as well. Even though I only have advertisement in the [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1036010745) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frvr.hex) versions, have disabled video ads (I hate those!), and only show ads about 30% of the time, when you start a new game. Hex FRVR still makes an amazing ~$600/day from in-game advertising. Not to bad for a simple puzzle game! [Spoiler](/s "Turn off internet for the app to remove all advertisement for free!")

Where it really did a difference was that initial traffic from Reddit + Reddit users sharing the game, was enough for the game to enter into the top-lists on the Apple App store around the country. In some cases, such as China, taking the #1 spot in Board and Puzzle for several days. The result was more than 400k organic and free downloads over a 5 day period. 

As the game was pretty new when I originally posted. It did have some major bugs bugs and left a lot of features to be desired. However /r/Gaming was amazing at giving feedback and quite a lot of the suggestions and ideas from the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3o43f8/what_started_out_as_a_test_ended_up_as_a_crazy/), has now been incorporated into the game. Here is a list of the major improvements:

* You now actually get a score bonus for doing combos!
* The game now saves the game state, if you reload or restart the app.
* At scores about 100k the game now becomes challenging for people who are really good at the game (Yes this was a major issue for r/Gaming redditors)
* You can now disable ads in the mobile version with a micro payment (This makes about $500/Month, thanks for the support!)
* The game no longer pauses your own music while playing on iOS!
* I rewrote the mobile versions from scratch, making the games feel like native apps on both Android and iOS.
* Many, many bug fixes. 

However, the success have had one downside. Today there is about 150 clones of the game on the market across app stores. And while I am actually 100% ok with people re-implementing the game, learning along the way and even making a more popular game than mine, about 40% of the games have straight up stolen music, graphics or even the entire game. Fighting that has been tiring and there don't seem to be an effective process for doing so on all platforms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I think to many indie developers embark on the journey without considering the business side of things. While making the game they really burn for, 99% of the time what they do create has little to no market appeal and should be left as a hobby exercise. (Like how you should not quit your job because you love drawing, unless you have a pretty surefire way of monetising your art)

Sadly that's not the way the press is presenting indie developers, mostly because it's only fun to talk about the successes. The successful developers just happened to burn for something that had mass market appeal / or where actually business savvy. The result is that we end up with quotes such as *"Just do what you feel is right, and eventually you will be successful"* which in truth is horrible advice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally much prefer to have a build once distribute everywhere and have put significant effort into having just that. However for your first game, it's more important to get anything live than it is what platform you made it in. Later you can worry about such details.

If your game is paid, you are basically 90% reliant on Apple features for traffic as paid games are rarely able to get into the top-lists without features. As soon as you have a good test build, send appstorepromotion@apple.com a link, then keep updating them with updates (Even if they do not reply at first, just keep going)

My model is ads between levels with a paid option to disable it. For now that seems to work very well. For not I will stick with it, as free games are easy to distribute (One of the things I am good at)

If you want more, I [blog](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com) quite openly about the company. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Submission Statement: What if? is a waste of time went the headline to the Cambridge historian Richard Evans piece in The Guardian last year. Surveying the many instances of public counterfactual discourse in the anniversary commemorations of the First World War, Evans wrote: This kind of fantasising is now all the rage, and threatens to overwhelm our perceptions of what really happened in the past, pushing aside our attempts to explain it in favour of a futile and misguided attempt to decide whether the decisions taken in August 1914 were right or wrong. Its hard enough to do the reading and research required to understand the complexity of actual events, Evans argues. Lets stay away from alternative universes. </TEXT>

And why in the world there are three S trainsshuttles going between Grand Central and Times Square in Manhattan, between Prospect Park and Franklin Avenue in Brooklyn, and to Rockaway Parkwhen there could easily be an S and, say, a K? To understand how this came to be, we need to go back 111 years, when the subway opened in Manhattan on Oct. 27, 1904. </TEXT>

But it has ballooned in ambition and nearly tripled in cost of $50 million in 2012. It reached $79 million in 2013. In July this year, it was raised to $102.6 million. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Australia was a pioneer nation in the sport of ski racing, with annual ski races being conducted at Kiandra during the 19th Century. The Kiandra snow shoe club is easily one of the oldest ski clubs in the world. The club was formed around 1861 by three Norwegians, Elias Gottaas, Soren Torp and Carl Bjerknes on the Kiandra Gold Fields, NSW. This original Kiandra ski club is now recognised as the first snow ski club in the world, it also carries the distinction of being the longest continuously operating club. In 2006, the Holmenkollen Ski Museum confirmed that the first two ski clubs in the world were formed by Norwegians in 1861, "both in Australia and Norway".* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Few tricks for getting better scores. 

* Do not keep the one tile. Rather always have multiple lines you can remove with a brick in your "deck". 
* Build the biggest combo you can around said brick. 
* Afterwards clean up the board and repeat.

How do you propose to make the game more fun? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a question that is going to be very diffrent from developer to developer, so don't accept my answer as a generic truth for all developers.

My games are fairly simple and is build mostly using technology that all devices already support (HTML5) so it's not that hard to make a windows port. Getting the technology in place and setting up store listings will likely take about 2 weeks.

However the problem is more about prioritisation. I am pretty much just me and there are higher opportunity things I could be working on. A simple example is that the Amazon Android App store is substantially bigger than the windows phone store. So it might make more sense to put my hours there.

When that is said, I am now hiring help on the platform side. Making it very likely that I will have WP support inside the next 2-3 months. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got interested in development at around 15 years old in QBasic by modifying the source code of the bundled examples such as snake. I had no reliable access to the internet back then, so ended up relying on library books to get me started.

While I later studied computer science, I had worked as a developer professionally for about 4 years. I wanted the education to give me a more theoretical background.

As for motivation, this one is hard. My biggest trick is to [release early](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/95918196337/creating-a-minimum-viable-product) and iterate from there. Nothing better than people playing your game to keep you motivated.

As what I did to stack traffic, the short list is this: 

* I arranged several features with web pages hosting the web version. 
* I released the game as a new version on app stores (People the updates)
* I tried buying advertisement cheaply.
* I did this AMA

While no where as successful as I had hoped, I managed to peak at #7 in the us Board category yesterday. Over the next few days I will keep trying to see where I end up at :)

Since then, I have been hard at work improving the game, and I am finally happy with the result with the latest 2.0.0 release. So now I would love feedback on what to do next? Where would you like to see the game go?

You can also still play the [web version here](http://hex.frvr.com) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The hardest part is making enough money to support yourself without having to do consultancy work (Major defocus).

My suggestion would be to start by participating in game jams to get your experience with making games at speed improved.

Hereafter get an exception to your competitive clause for the games you are making. Would be a really bad thing if the startup you are working for claims that they own the games you make.

Lastly, release early, collect feedback and most importantly experiment. [More on that here](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/95918196337/creating-a-minimum-viable-product)

PM me if you go down this route and have something ready to show and I will help you the game in front of an audience :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Time for math and pseudo code!

    var chance = currentScore * random(0.0 - 1.0)
        if(chance less_than 20000) tile = random_tile_including_the_one_tile
        else if(chance less_than 40000) tile = random_tile_not_including_the_one_tile
        else tile = random_tile_not_including_the_one_tile_and_including_the_evil_tile

In short the one tile is decreasingly likely to happen. At 30000 you are 33% less likely to get the one tile, at 40000 you are 50% less likely. (I believe, someone better at combinatorics correct me if I am wrong)

Honestly the best channel for you is going to depend a lot on what kind of game you are want to make. 

* Male oriented action game  Steam
* Female oriented puzzle game  Facebook
* Super niche indie games  Tumblr
* Anything  Apple and Google features if you can get them!

As for social channels, by far the biggest is Sina Weibo, which exploded organically by itself by the ability to share the game as a link. A distant second would be Reddit. </TEXT>

**The answer I want** Polish. It's incredible how much the game experience can be improved by tweaking an animation, improving the mobile experience or tweaking graphics.

**The truth for FRVR** Engine work. To date, properly less than 30% of total work as been around actually doing games. The rest has been trying to get the games to run well on all devices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With my previous game I did quite well by allowing 3rd party websites to embed the game. This is a strategy I have used for Hex FRVR as well. While really successful, Reddit simply dwarfed the traffic in volume.

If you do a Google Search for ("Hex FRVR")[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22hex+frvr%22] you will see thousands of sites embedding the game as an iFrame.

For longterm growth I rely very heavily on App Store and Google search optimisation. Try searching for Hex on either app store. If I did everything right my game should pop up on top :)

Even more long term is [brand building](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/95104073432/on-building-a-strong-brand). Trying to make [FRVR](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/95775223752/frvr-my-new-game-company) a household name people will search for when wanting to play a quality game. Here I went so far as to register FRVR as a trademark in the games space. </TEXT>

With version 2.0.0 the difficulty now increases with your points.

<TEXT> A) Probably not, it's been suggested and even tried. It's very diffrent game with rotation and thew the game balance completely off. While I am not against it, it would be a completely diffrent game.

B) For now I have limited myself to pieces that have 4 hexagons (Except the 1 dot piece). Not entirely sure I understand what you mean with 2-3 sided pieces. Can you draw a picture?

C) This is absolutely something I am considering in connecting with adding more game modes. The slow puzzle game as it exist right now is quite fun, but some people seem to really like a mechanic with progression alla Candy Crush. For something like that, bombs, obstructions, chain reactions, etc. would be natural. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely, before I realised that I was on to something I was basically just playing around with JavaScript. There I managed to dump about [230 man hours](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/94739350790/setting-the-stage-baseline-key-performance) into the project before I started a more structured approach.  

In hindsight I wish I had been much more structured from day one! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am only keeping track of highscore two places

* Facebook where the score is 318120
* iOS where the current highscore is ~~60250~~ 61400

However the Facebook score is misleading as it includes version 1.0.0 scores. Before version 2.0.0 the game did not get harder as the score increased, so if you where carefull most clever people could play forever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great question!

I have a custom HTML5 game engine written on-top of a heavily modified fork of [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com). 

For multiplatform support, I initially relied on [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) but quickly ran into technical limitions I was unable to solve myself. In a search for a solution I was lucky enough to bump into an amazing developer who was able to write my custom integrations for mobile from scratch. Much more info on that [here](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/131920929742/replacing-cordova)

My biggest mistake so far in the project was to build my own game engine which I ended up totally scrapping for my current PixiJS based solution. Doing so was a [really hard choice](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/114408890172/pride-ignorance-and-lag-of-focus), but I am incredibly happy I did it today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hex FRVR was inspired by a multiplayer game, played inside Second Life. There you had a small 5x5 or 6x6 grid, which you could fill up with [Tetrominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino) in a similar fashion.

However, Hex FRVR was never intended to become a real game. Rather is was a test of my new abstracted engine technology. But while testing it was simply to fun to not release as a game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 4 Months ago I quit my day job to focus 100% on making games while traveling the world. Since then I have traveled mostly in the US and Canada, but is currently in Denmark visiting family. Next up is skiing for 17 days in [Whistler](http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com) then 28 days of skiing in [Portes du Soleil](http://en.portesdusoleil.com) France.

Reddit was my lucky break. My latest game, [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com), blew up on [this /r/Gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3o43f8/what_started_out_as_a_test_ended_up_as_a_crazy/) thread which resulted in a [huge amount](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/131847710352/20-days-of-hex-frvr-distribution) of social traffic, especially on [Weibo](http://www.weibo.com) in China.

Today, I [released version 2.0.0](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/132595909292/hex-200) of [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) on both web and mobile - [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1036010745) - [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frvr.hex)

[View the live stats for the release!](http://www.twitch.tv/cbenjaminsen) (Join the chat!)

~~3000~~ ~~3500~~ ~~4000~~ 4500 online!

From the first day, I wanted to be 100% transparent with the startup. Sharing numbers, ups   downs and tips on how others can do what I am doing.

To that end I write a very honest blog [here](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com). The [first post](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/94738198525/lets-make-a-hobby-startup), outlining the motivation for creating FRVR.

Next version, scheduled to be released next Thursday will also offer an in app payment to disable ads as an experiment.

Looks like my revenue is normalising around $650/day after having spiked at almost $1k/day.
I am however preparing a major distribution push on Thursday. If everything goes as planned, I hope to at-least double the size of the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have all been there! However before you do so, patch it up so it works without to many bugs. **Then release it!** If it's a success with users you can consider a rewrite.

Also stop writing reusable components, it's almost exclusively always a waste of time. At-least do not do so until you made 2-3 games so you have an idea what will actually be reused.

Again, and I cannot say this enough. Get the game live, get users on it, build a fanbase, get feedback, etc. This is 100x more likely to make this and future game a success than the imitate rewrite you are considering.

**Shameless self promotion starts here**

That thing was, and is still magic. After about 20kb of data send to the browser in a streaming document the browser will start executing individual script tags. This was how we managed to build something that was live back when. 

Even more fun you could inject http requests into the streaming document to make use of the same HTTP 1.1 connection making transport to the server as fast.

Someone wrapped it up and buzzworded it [Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_\(programming\)) about 5 years later.

<TEXT> Don't do tutorials, instead make something you currently think is outside your competencies. Then solve problems as they appear. You will learn much more this way than doing tutorials.

Personally I would not learn a library like jQuery or React to improve my JavaScript skills. They are almost languages on their own right and unless you expect to work in them later, you are simply confusing your JavaScript skills.

However, Node.js might be cool, allows you to do all kinds of cool things in JavaScript that is not related to the browser. I've personally used it to make build scripts, web scrapers, websites and much much more.

Personally I wrote the [ExtendJS](http://extendjs.org) library for myself, for when I need to do more structured projects. However I ended up not actually using it much, as it comes with a performance overhead which I do not want when making games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was actually made aware of 1010 when I showed the finished Hex to a few friends. My originally inspiration was from an in-game game played in Second Life. 

There is also a guy somewhere in this comment thread, saying he played pretty much Hex in a package that was released in 1990.

Basically, being unique in the casual puzzle field is near impossible as there are thousands of clever guys out there who got there first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually use Cordova directly currently - not a huge fan of the phonegab wrapper. 

Even more so, I just hired a developer to help build custom wrappers. Cordova has a huge memory overhead and the game keeps crashing on Android. Time to do better!

Hey r/AndroidGaming, I am an indie developer trying to make a living creating web and mobile games. I just released my latest game Hex FRVR to both Google Play and iTunes App Store. However due to Google's much better approval system it's already live on Android while I am still waiting for Apple...

Hex FRVR is a small hexagon puzzle game, where the goal is simply to survive as long as possible. I did my very best to make the game as polished and fun to play as possible.

I would really appreciate r/AndroidGaming feedback. I will stick around for the rest of today to answer any questions and collect feedback!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey puzzlers, I recently released my first game in quite a while. It's a simple solitaire game that can be played right in the browser on both web and mobile.

As of now the game only supports the very classical windows flip 3 game but I am looking to turn it into something better. 

**So what features is a most have and what would you like to see in a good Solitaire game?**

Play it here [http://solitaire.frvr.com/](http://solitaire.frvr.com/?rppz)

On a side note the game has now been live for a few days and my analytics show that only 3.7% of people who play wins a game. (Not for the lack of trying, they play 3.42 games on average). According to the [internet](http://webpages.charter.net/jstefan/solitaire.htm) the chance of winning is about 1 in 5.4 or 18.5%. 

With that in mind, I look very much forward to seeing how well this subreddit does. </TEXT>

So, what is your favorite experiane in the Bay Area? What is the one thing I absolutely should see/do/experience while here?

* I have a car, so getting around is not an issue. 
* Free experiences are welcome, but it's not a big problem if there is a fee.
