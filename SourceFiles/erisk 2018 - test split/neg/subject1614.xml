<TEXT> Melanoma is a highly metastatic cancer and there is plenty of patient data in the cancer genome atlas that we can use to identify potential targets. These mechanisms identified can often be translated to different tissue models so studying them in an easily obtained model is greatly beneficial. </TEXT>

Generally people are living longer, and our methods of detecting cancer have greatly improved leading to a rise in reported cancer diagnostics. Most cancer events arise from an accumulation of mutations in somatic cells and typically when people tend to live longer they are more likely to accumulate more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First author here. Next steps are to fully characterize the transcriptional coactivation of KDM3A in prostate cancer and then transition to a melanoma model and study its impact upon regulating metabolic genes  in these two highly metastatic cancers. 

Interestingly enough KDM3A is also involved in mediating estrogen receptor hormone signaling in breast cancer. The question continues if such a cooperation exists in melanoma as well. </TEXT>

Most cancer therapies are similar to burning down a whole forest when you want to get rid of a couple of trees that are blighted. This study identifies a potential therapeutic target, but much more work is needed to characterize its role in cancer. </TEXT>

Of course the alternative and cheaper way is to read scientific literature on your own outside of class, but that requires some discipline. There are plenty of youtube videos that introduce fields of biology: microbiology, immunology, stem cells, genomics, cancer genetics, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My lab is looking at shifts in cellular metabolism that occur in cancer using a systems biology approach. My role in the lab is looking at gene regulation using high throughput sequencing techniques. Started out as strictly computational and now that I've advanced to candidacy I am working on generating the data in house myself. Once you've had that taste of success or progress on a project you're truly invested in then you commit to it and you want to see whats next in your research story.

I've always wanted my work to be relevant or useful for helping to save lives and that started out as doing something in the medical field like being a doctor or something. I went as far as taking the MCAT and volunteering in the emergency room. I wasn't sure if that was what I really wanted so I looked into other applications for what I was learning in my undergraduate. I applied to work in a research lab where at first I just attended lab meetings and journal clubs. I started having more fun in lab then cramming for tests or volunteering in the ER. Once i showed that I was reliable they started giving me more and more responsibilities. I initially wanted to do benchwork, but I was given an opportunity to excel in a computational analysis of ChIPSeq datasets. I wasn't particularly knowledgeable on how to proceed but i taught myself the skills and the steps to proceed and was able to come back with some answers. My P.I. was impressed with my progress that he offered to pick me up for graduate school.

In conclusion my advice for you is:
-Find and excel in the field of biology you are the most passionate about
-Applying for graduate school is like applying for a job: be able to sell yourself and your skill set. 
-Phd is a long journey, but it is made of little steps made everyday. Make sure they are meaningful
- Trying something new and know that teaching yourself new skills opens doors.

<TEXT> Given this scenario you might want to consider how cell signaling affects cell fate and differentiation. Transcription factors themselves have to have their expression regulated so it isn't surprising that there are motifs found in the gene body. The most likely answer is that the transcription factors that bind in HOXA vs. HOXB gene regions will be responders to different signals telling the cell to develop into forelimb or hindlimb tissue. These cell fate responders can either be stimulatory, inhibitory, or something in between.

<TEXT> Keep in my mind that applying for graduate school is not the same thing as applying for undergraduate: you aren't applying for a position at the university but for a position within a lab. 

The bare minimum a PIs look for a good student with good GRE, GPA, and a great personal statement. What is the real clincher is what you have on your CV: what experience do you have and how can you help out the lab. 

Did you make any meaningful progress in the research you accomplished? What does being active in college mean? What skills did you pick up in industry? 

Applying to graduate school is similar to marketing: know how to sell yourself and who you are selling yourself to. Know the field you want to work in, know if your potential PI is interested in picking up students, and know how soon you can start working potentially for your potential PI. Think about what you'd want to do with your degree, and what the program you are applying to is like. 

Let me know if there are any other questions you want answers to maybe i can help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most people are familiar with genetics as having to do with DNA or with genes. Make sure they understand what DNA is and what gene regions within DNA are. The easiest form of epigenetics for people to understand in my opinion is how DNA is packaged around histones and how histone remodeling fits in with gene expression so the rest of my post will be about that.
 
I'd start out by stating saying that epigenetics is a form of regulating gene expression, but not at the DNA level. Tell them to imagine DNA being millions of nucleotides long, and that in order for them to be stored in space as small a cell requires them to be packaged in a special way by proteins called histones. Tell them to think of histones and DNA like a yoyo: The DNA is the string and it wraps itself around the histone. Much like the yoyo the String can be completely wrapped around the yoyo or it can be completely unwrapped around the yoyo. When the DNA is unwrapped around the histone the gene regions can be read and expressed and when the DNA is wrapped around the histone the genes cannot be read. 

There are proteins that wrap/unwrap the DNA around the histones and they know which histones to work on due to chemical modifications done to the histone. These chemical markers are part of a histone code and understanding where and why they are added to specific histones is an active part of investigation in epigenetics at the moment.

Sorry for the lengthy response, but its complicated to explain to people. Let me know if there are more areas that I can clarify. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The amount of math you require depends on the field of biology you are thinking about entering. While Math may be problematic the lessons from it are very useful when applied to biology: think about how you want to solve the problem, plan out your steps, apply methods you know to find an answer, show your work, and check your answer to make sure you don't find a mistake. You'd be surprised how much stuff outside of your intended field serve as powerful lessons. 

If you intend to to become a molecular biologist you may be working with bioinformatic or molecular dynamic programs to find the answers you are looking for in your research. These tools may utilize pre-calc, calculus, and statistics.

Don't be intimidated by math. I also had some problems in high school and during undergrad, but I got some help and did a lot of practice problems. I was surprised when matrices from pre-calc  became relevant in my research.

TLDR; If this is what you are passionate about think about how you can apply what you have learned to solving the problem , ask for help whenever you can get it, and expect things to reappear at some point in your career.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me try and answer some of your questions point by point....

cells are able to detect overpopulation, but its not necessarily through telomere length. Imagine you are at the movie theatre and all the seats are filled. You wouldn't sit on a  stranger's lap if the movie is sold out: you would effectively remove your self from the theatre so the intended audience size can watch the movie undisturbed. Now in a situation of cancer cells imagine a drunk person were to walk into this same scenario: their inhibitions are now gone and they don't care if they have to watch this movie sitting on some stranger's lap. They will just sit down even thought its bothering the people around them. 

Your cells treat the telomere length much like you would treat the expiration date of food at the supermarket. Some cells are meant to have a limited shelf life over others.  

In some cancer cells they prolong their life by inducing the expression of telomerase. Similar to the Mr. Meeseeks from rick and morty show cells can start acting weird if they dont eventually die. They can accumulate mutations which may alter how the cells behave and may eventually become cancerous. So in terms of fighting cancer we would want to stop or prevent cells from using telomerase.

Slowing down the aging process is complicated because the cell needs not only to keep its telomeres a certain length, but conserve the gene coding regions (make sure mutations don't occur). 

Telomere research is useful for gathering information regarding chromosomal disorders, shelf life of differentiated cells, and how they function in stem cells. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Strongly suggest looking into using ubuntu for your linux needs. It takes features from both MAC and windows operating systems. While a lot of linux based tools are able in MAC OSX there is still a niche that doesn't work with MAC. Dual booting with a windows is definitely a good idea just make sure you allocate enough memory to both sides and include some room for what is called a "memory swap". Definitely work with a operating system that can work with java as well. 

For my genomic studies I would advocate as large of memory/storage as you can afford. When processing next generation sequencing datasets the genome alignment is memory intensive and may limit how many datasets you can process at a given moment. Additionally you'll find with some of your projects that you may be working with large data files and you'll need space for storage. For example I once had a raw SNP file that was 38 GB in a cancer SNP study I was working on. Its best to keep intermediate files when going through a pipeline in case you need to go back and optimize a step. 

Everyone has their biases for which machine or operating system to use. My advice is to figure out what you need to finish your work and buy a machine based off that. Additionally sticking with what you are comfortable may limit what you are able to do and limit what you are able to learn in terms of bioinformatics.  </TEXT>

Dr. Emily Jane McTavish, Assistant Professor in the Quantitative   Systems Biology graduate group at the University of California, Merced, joins us to talk about her research as a phylogeneticist and computational biologist.

<TEXT> So IRP stands for the Iron response protein. Normally if Iron is present it attaches to this transcription factor that regulates a gene expression of specific genes by binding to its genomic response element (RE) sequence. IRE just means response element.

Mutations can either add or take away a function from a protein: So based on what you learned can you speculate the possible functions that would result from a mutation to the Iron response protein? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Purely Speculation here but this how I would answer your question: Now there is a possibility are varying phenotypic traits within the population of fish that may give them the ability to survive this threshold event by obtaining nutrition through an alternative food source. Then in the next generation the fish within the population would have undergone a bottleneck effect meaning most of the fish have this new advantageous trait. But realistically they would probably just die off as there food source is now gone. I think it would be more realistic for an already existing trait to be altered instead of developing a new trait altogether (This would take much longer on a geological timescale).  

Edit: Estimating a time scale for developing a whole new physical trait </TEXT>

<TEXT> My advice for experiment design is look at the questions the professor's lab is interested in, research the field a bit more, and then designing the experiment. Alternatively depending on the professor by asking to sit in on group meetings or asking to help out with general lab management tasks is a sure fire way to get involved in a research setting. In order to do this however you will need to maintain a good gpa, show that you can be reliable, you are able to learn, and that you can be self-reliant. The first step is to convince the professor that in time you will contribute to the lab instead of being a hinderance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I can tell you from my experience is that depending on the university and the graduate program there may be an opportunity to be a teaching assistant and that may wave your tuition and give you a salary to work off of. Some of the MSc programs here in California set it up so internships are part of your coursework and that in turn sets you up for a career afterwards. Depending on the medical route you want to pursue you may just need to take some certifications and you should look at that as an investment rather than acquiring more dept.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So there are three routes that you could take: Medical, Research, and Industry, and Academia. Some of these options may require further eduction/certification but that depends on what you want to do.

Medical: Doesn't necessarily mean being a doctor or a nurse. There is a need for people in an administrative or technician position. Further certification may be needed, but there should be something in the public health sector that might work for you.

Research: Doesn't necessarily mean graduate school. Research labs whether its for universities or private institutions some positions may require a lab technician that maintains equipment or assists with a specific procedure in lab. There is also the position of a lab manager that oversees the lab inventory and keeps track of logistics to keep researchers focused on their work.

Industry: If you are incredibly knowledgeable about a procedure or a technique or the materials necessary to perform a technique you might be able to get a job to generate oligos, prepare antibodies, or be a sales representative for selling biotechnology.

Academia: Not necessarily teaching, but at some universities they require someone to supervise and maintain the instructional labs. This one may require much more certification though.

It depends mainly on what you see yourself doing.

<TEXT> Usually the first semester is usually the roughest, but practice time management and do the work your supposed to do on time you'll be fine. Once you get the hang of being a teaching assistant and have your project worked out you'll be in the swing of things. My advice is try to get the course requirements out of the way (but dont overload yourself) cause then that makes more time for research. If you are nervous I'd look into working with your PI over the summer if possible to get a feel on things before the school year starts. Lastly an absolute must do is developing a strong social network with your peers and planning some fun things in your downtime. </TEXT>
