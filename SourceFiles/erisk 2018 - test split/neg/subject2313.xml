<TEXT> The thing is though....there really isn't much debate about nutrition; A diet rich in vegetables and wholegrains, with added pasture raised meat (although meat is not necessary) and fish, has consistantly shown to be a superior choice to all other diets.

There is, in fact, a list of about 10 food items that can basically help you live to 100 years old if you follow a moderately strict diet.

Kale, Broccoli. Garlic/Onion (Allium vegetables), Salmon, Oats, Pomegranate, Turmeric, Mushrooms, Hemp oil

eat these 10 and you'll live to 100

In west Philadelphia I was born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do your best to get a job and simplify your outgoing costs as much as you can. At your age, you need a cheap car and a good phone plan.

Pick between 4 and 10 local jobs to go for a week. Explain your situation to an employer and tell them you will work hard. Employers are people, and they hire people, not robots - so I'm sure an employer will give you a chance. 

Believe in yourself. Value each dollar in your wallet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A friend and I were stranded in the South Australian country; having to walk 10 miles between a town of 1500 people to a town of less than 100 people.

4am and we are half way through our journey when a man in a milk van drives up to us. We never heard him coming.

"I'll give you a ride" he says, in a high pitched elongated yawn.

"Na, it's cool man, we're okay walking", we said.

"There was no way we were going with him", my friend exclaimed as he drove off.

2 weeks later, we are in the town bakery. As we shopped we discussed the 'weird milkman' incident.

Desperately, the woman working behind the counter asks: "when did this happen"?!

"2 weeks ago on Saturday", I replied.

She began crying and a lady doing some shopping told us not to be so insensitive. 

"What do you mean"? we asked.

"Her husband, the milkman', died 4 weeks ago.

He was described exactly as we remember him. Apart from one thing...

"A high pitched voice" I asked?

"No". She replied.

"A very deep voice".

"But he did hang himself"

When the dude rebuilds it a thousand years later, he can just explain to everyone that has forgotten the history of the ship, that 'technically' it is a replica, whilst he has rebuilt the original.
Doesn't seem that hard to me. </TEXT>
