<TEXT> I was playing recreational softball and I hadn't been feeling well but I had to play anyway. I was playing center field, minding my own business, praying to God above that no one hit anything my way. He did not listen. I was staring off into the distance when I hear someone yell "Heads Up" and I turn to see the ball flying to a spot about a 15 yards away. I turned and started to sprint, about .01 seconds into my first full stride I felt a piping hot burst. I couldn't just hang a left and run back to my car. I HAD to go get that ball, so I waddled over to the ball and just quick threw it... I was 30 feet short of the nearest person. So I waddled to the ball, tossed it again, and immediately turned to my car. 

The next game, I was presented with a bag of diapers all signed by the team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a cast member that recently signed up to work with our troupe. We are a small troupe that needs people. 

This guy is the most arrogant and cocky ass I've ever met. He steamrolls scenes and has no idea. He doesn't understand that there are 4 other people.

However, he has great additions and enthusiasm for improv.

Any thoughts on how to tone him down without being a total asshole? </TEXT>

I did however, empathize with my mutual friend. They were close and I respect that they just lost their friend. But concerning me? Fuck that guy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Galvestonian here to call you and the other people assholes. Don't come to Galveston expecting it to be Destin and Cabo. Hell, not even South Padre. That's not what we're all about. We're a historic town that has developed a character unmatched anywhere in Texas. Yes we have our problems, not going to say we don't, but it's an amazing town with awesome people. Everyone is so nice, it is a way more accepting community than the surrounding mainland. It has the BEST children's burn unit in the WORLD. It also has the ability to deal with the highest classification of diseases. (I know that isn't brochure material) To continue, we have 5+ city wide festivals that bring over 1,000,000 visitors to the island each year!

The water isn't brown, it's clear. There is sediment from the Mississippi River. 

So if you don't like, get the fuck out, and please stop bashing my hometown. I've lived my whole life letting WASP from the burbs tell me how terrible my city is. 

Ps. Friday night it only cost 20$ to get you and your friend hammered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One time a cop came to my house to ask me to move my vehicle because I parked it in a handicapped spot on the street that was so poorly marked he understood, when I opened the door the smell of pot went flying out the door. He gave me the look of "oh you're fucked." He then asked me if I had graduated college and had a job. I said yes, which is true. He then, very matter-of-factly, "There is the two different things, there is the law, and there is the spirit of the law. Please move your car and have a wonderful evening." And he left. 

What a wonderful man that gets it.

<TEXT> Hahahahha that's what I get for not proofreading. 

We certainly did, and it was a humbling moment for me because I did not think America was that racist. Though the more I thought and discussed with friends and colleagues I'm trending more towards people were fed up with the establishment (motivations are unknown to me) and looked past the racism/bigotry/etc... to get someone ultra anti-establishment. I understand Bernie was out of the establishment but the strong anti-democrat sentiment seemed to be more prevalent than strong anti-republican until the election.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, people definitely are attending the event. There is definitely a sub-culture of conservatives in College Station that sympathize with this. However, the university and organizations within the student body are hosting programs at the same time of the event so students can peacefully protest. Several thousands students participating in events occurring at the same time is a great way of protesting the ideas and rhetoric of Mr. Spencer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just found him ... I'm buying a tank off Craigslist tomorrow. Found out the hard way they are an incredibly aggressive species.

Update: I was able to get this together today. Now we wait, he is very shy and I don't want to poke him out,  

[The Setup](https://imgur.com/gallery/i2vWZ) 

Still haven't caught him... he is ultra elusive and I also discovered he climbs INTO the fridges components. I'm assuming because it's warm up there. I've got a proper lamp and all, but he seems to dig the fridge. 11/28/16

Sad news. 11/30/16

The gecko has passed away. I didn't seem him since our encounter and I had a suspicion he was somewhere in the workings of the fridge. I looked and never saw anything. I noticed a smell last night and I knew it was him. I dissembled the bottom of the fridge and he was living  between the fan and the compressor. Lots of feces and bugs, must have lived there for a long time. It's sad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Awesome man, thanks. I guess I was amazed by the intense cultural diversity. Before I went to Europe I was ignorant enough to think that countries had a single identity with minor differences. 

I had a similar realization when going through France. Specially with Paris vs.  Rest of France.

I was told they hop and trains and when they land in the train station that they become marooned there. I'm not sure what Romanians look like.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was amazed with how similar Bavaria was to Texas. Bavarians are incredibly proud like Texans. Their mentality is "I'm Bavarian before I'm German." It was interesting to see Munich compared to Berlin. Not sure if that's the actual mentality expressed by them but it is what I observed. 

Also, I was in the Berlin train station for a few hours waiting for a train to Prague and there was a TON of refugees begging. They are the most aggressive beggars I've ever encountered. They gave the guys beneath the Eiffel Tower a run for their money. Really put the crisis into perspective for me.  </TEXT>
