<TITLE> The View from the Cheap Seats, by Neil Gaiman - A How-to Guide... </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm curious as to how other Redditors approached this title. Did you read it in chunks at a time? Pick out preferred pieces based on their title or the idea behind them? Burn through it in as few lengthy sittings as possible, as per Caitlin Moran's apparent suggestion on the cover?

I'd wanted to get started on Neil's non-fiction works, but hadn't realized what exact format the book would take, and I've found myself at a bit of a loss in terms of how to tackle it. Any suggestions would be most appreciated. :-) </TEXT>

While I'm here, I might mention that I'm having difficulty with a lot of notifications; aside from Facebook Messenger, which also handles my SMS functionality, I either don't receive notifications at all or else they come through whilst I'm checking manually...

<TITLE> IMAX in Ireland - What are we really getting? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-30 17:14:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just wanted t'ask /r/ireland for clarification on the whole IMAX/iSense thing that Cineworld and the Odeon crew have going, respectively. I'm not sure I can comment on the latter, but I've recently heard the former referred to as lie-MAX, as well as other, similarly negative commentary surrounding the experience.

I've been t'see some pretty huge big-screen releases in the Cineworld venue (*Captain America: Civil War* and *Doctor Strange*, for instance), and I'm currently trying to decide if it'd be worth it for *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2*, or if I'd just be kidding myself into spending money that I don't have on branding...

I'd like t'be able to defend whether or not it's worth it if I'm inviting friends out, so any kind of information on what separates these IMAX (or so-called IMAX) experiences from traditional ones would be hugely appreciated.

Many thanks all, I'm looking forward t'hearing a pick 'n' mix of opinions and information! </TEXT>

Not that it's a huge deal, but it could certainly paint the scene where the two first meet in a new light, right? Peter's maybe a little more anxious about his visitor than we thought at first, no? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So it's come to this...

I *may* soon be in the unenviable position of depending upon either of the above devices as a daily driver, for at least a couple of weeks, as a test, in a sense... I'm coming from an Android device (LG's Nexus 5X, to be specific, running Lineage), and while I'm quite capable on a technical level, I don't have a huge amount of experience with iOS.

I'm wondering what I could do t'make the most of my upcoming... experience. I'm open to hardware suggestions (I've access to a Mophie Juice Pack, for example), but for now I'm mostly interested in advice concerning software.

Anything in particular that I can/should be aware of? Any advice would be helpful, and is thoroughly appreciated in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're still not sure whether the phone Pete's sporting in trailer two is an iPhone 3G or a 3GS ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/4qt3qe/peter_parker_has_an_iphone_3g_with_a_cracked/) set photo doesn't do much t'help...), but it occurred t'me today to take a look at what kinda laptop he's working with in the first trailer, [right here at 1:14](https://youtu.be/xrzXIaTt99U?t=1m14s)... Apparently it's not a Microsoft Surface, which I'd previously assumed. Anybody got any suggestions as to what kinda machine it might be?

I feel like this is the one that really puts Peter's ingenuity on display; it wasn't a temporary thing 'til he put together the real costume later on, because as far as he was concerned this *was* the real costume, one that he'd committed to incrementally upgrading over time.

<TITLE> LOS on the HTC One (M8) - First Things First... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-18 20:38:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all, absolutely loving the ROM on my Nexus 5x, not to mention my Nexus 7, and I'm encouraging others to jump aboard where they can, so kudos t'the devs for all of their hard work and support.

I've been hoping to install the ROM on my sister's unused HTC One (M8), which currently lacks an OS. I've got an unlocked bootloader, but that's about as far as I've managed to get. I can't seem to install TWRP, as fastboot throws up an error message. My understanding is that I'm limited to installing .img files rather than .zips via fastboot, at least until I can get an OS up and running on the damn thing, at which point I can flash a custom recovery and then every .zip I could ever want.

Anybody got any advice as to what my next steps should be? I'd hugely appreciate the help, as I have with everything the LineageOS community has provided thus far.

Cheers folks, many thanks in advance. :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all,

I'm wondering what devices, face, and use-case combinations users have found offers them the most discretion in using their watch. I've worked in an area where such a device would attract a lot of (potentially negative) attention, and would like to know what I could do to keep such a device as inconspicuous as possible.

I don't currently own a device, so I'm open to suggestions on both what t'use and how to use it - and I know it's not Android Wear, but I'm also open to suggestions regarding the Gear S2/3.

Huge thanks in advance, I'm looking forward to hearing all comments and suggestions. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question concerning factory reset. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-01 16:39:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Probably gonna out myself as a n00b here, but in flashing CM 14.1 today I failed to adequately follow [this](https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_bullhead#Installing_CyanogenMod_from_recovery) guide, and missed the seventh step, which involves hitting Factory Reset. I'd previously hit all five boxes in the Advanced options of TWRP's Wipe screen, however, the phone reported that the previous OS wasn't present, and all my data from my last install is gone.

Should I go back t'TWRP for a fresh install and start all over again, or am I just about even with the guide? Did I essentially follow the steps, just labelled differently, or am I gonna make a mess for myself further down the line? What'cha think?

Huge thanks in advance, folks, and if y'all have any further advice it's much appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm wondering if anybody can offer me their best step-by-step for installing CM14.1 on my Nexus 5x? I'm currently running a CM13 nightly build from June, which was a couple of days after the phone arrived, so I've much more to lose this time 'round if things go wrong, and there do seem t'be a couple more steps involved, which I seem to be tripping up over.

Li'l help, anyone? </TEXT>

I'd really like t'know what's on shelves at the moment in terms of Spider-People, and where those books might've come from or spun out of, which'll make catching up a heckuva lot easier... I won't be offended by the odd spoiler, but keep it to a minimum if possible, right?

<TITLE> Help Choosing a Part-Time Course? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-27 21:42:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all!

I've been given the opportunity, through my employer, to undertake a course of study on a part-time basis. I'm considering a move into ICT, which my employer strongly backs, but I'm unsure of which course I should pursue. I'm hoping y'all could possibly provide me with some insight and/or advice.

I'm based in Dublin City Centre, which is unlikely to change in the near future, so access to a City Centre college would be an advantage, obviously. Examples I've come across include *[BSc Information Systems and Information Technology](http://dit.ie/computing/parttime/bscinformationsystemsandinformationtechnology/)* in D.I.T., *[BSc in Information Systems](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/undergraduate/information-systems/)* in Trinity College Dublin,
*[BSc (Hons) Computing](http://goo.gl/leYT8A)* in D.B.S., and *[BSc (Honours) in Computing](https://goo.gl/o2yHGt)* in N.C.I. I should voice my concerns, however, that none of these courses are specifically termed "Computer Science." Should this worry me?

Further to that, I'd be interested in keeping my options open for the future, following on from the course's (hopeful!) completion; for instance, I don't want to waste time and money being taught how best to tell someone to switch their router off then on again - moving into academia could strongly interest me in the future.

I'm open to all suggestions right now, and anybody who wishes to share any personal but sensitive information is welcome to send me a PM, I'll be happy to offer more details on my own circumstances.

Huge thanks in advance t'this community, I'm hopeful that I can become a much more active contributor should I take up a relevant course.

An additional note I might mention is that I do already possess an undergraduate degree, granted not of the highest order, but I felt it may make a difference. Cheers! </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're seeing more and more smartwatches in public, and although they may be more commonplace, and hence more readily accepted, I'm still not sure I'd want any attention that a smartwatch might warrant, especially in the workplace.

I'm interested in hearing about how both device setup and use can contribute to discretion when wearing/using a smartwatch. What, if anything, have you guys found works? What doesn't? Most importantly, what hilarious stories can you share?

Huge thanks in advance folks, this could be interesting! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-05-27 22:02:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm hoping to squeeze a few more months, at least, out of this device, and a custom ROM is the way I'd like t'go, specifically the one in the title - at least until the official build comes 'round.

Anyway, I'm having monumental difficulty flashing these builds, and I'm hoping someone could offer me their advice. I'm currently using an unofficial build of CM 12.1, in conjunction with TWRP 2.8.7.0, if that helps. I've removed the relevant line of code from updater-script, and now the error that I'm seeing is even more vague.

I'm not entirely sure I'm in a position to shell out for a new device just (and believe me, I've been tempted!), so any advice at all would be helpful.

Many thanks in advance. </TEXT>

Assuming it's still happening, of course...

I'm getting a little antsy, and have been strongly considering the unofficial this week. What's been the general experience? Go ahead, or hold off?

Many thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I admit that budgetary and time constraints have prevented me from actually playing the game myself, but I've gotten the gist of the story through visiting friends and watching Let's Plays courtesy of YouTube, but it's occurred to me that the titular Arkham Knight doesn't actually get a whole lot of screen time. For a game named after him, his appearances seem pretty sparse.

I'm wondering if anybody else felt this way, or would you folks contend that my opinion is unjustified? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to volunteer at a nursing home, and part of the work I did there involved feeding certain residents.

One resident in particular could never seem to understand how it had gotten so dark so quickly, which isn't unusual in the middle of winter. When similar "observations" arose during the long summer days, and her questions became more specific t'the room around her, I started to wonder if she might be suffering from Alzheimer's; that said, she seemed oddly lucid outside of this issue with how "dark" it was.

It turned out that the woman was actually blind. For whatever reason, it simply wasn't something she could accept. </TEXT>

What was the suggested purpose of their play? Were they believed to be investing early into their next system? Did they deliberately want streaming to become the *de facto* "format?" That'd stand to reason, IMHO -the 360 was, after all, among the first devices to support Netflix streaming via a native application, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  White people are pretty. Blue eyes are pretty.

This was an oddly refreshing observation to read. Thank you for your compliment. :-)

 American men are polite. They don't touch me without my permission and don't stare at me like they can see through my clothes. That said, I went clubbing in Vegas once and got my butt grabbed so many times. So I guess the men here can be aggressive but only in certain places. In everyday life I'm not afraid of being assaulted and it's a huge relief.

I'm sorry about your unfortunate encounters in Vegas, but as a straight white male I really appreciate the sentiment that American men are polite - it's not something we're inclined to hear too often in the public discourse, in my own experience.

I'm not sure where it is you came from, but your English is absolutely impeccable. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-06-13 22:30:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all,

I currently have the opportunity to acquire a [Mid-2010 White Unibody Polycarbonate Macbook](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP584?locale=en_US) to upgrade and use as a desktop for a relatively decent price, but I have a couple of questions I'd like to get out of the way first.

1) The most important question concerns noise - I'm coming from a 2013 Macbook Air, which recently failed me, but that device was entirely silent. I'd intend to use the new computer as a desktop replacement, and though I won't be doing anything particularly computationally intense, it would be nice if I could leave it running overnight without having my sleep disturbed. How loud is the 2010 when operational? Would upgrading to an SSD (recommendations welcome, BTW) serve to reduce the noise by much?

2) Again, although I won't be doing anything too intense, how would the performance compare to my base model Air? Would the downgrade be noticeable, even if I went ahead and added an SSD?

3) I've heard conflicting reports on the amount of RAM the machine in question can utilize. At what point is it that I'm wasting my money?

4) I'm not entirely sold on the white polycarbonate look, and my budget would permit me to purchase some skins and keyboard covers. Can anybody recommend somewhere I could acquire these?

Many thanks in advance everybody, I'm looking forward to hopefully making a decision on the machine before the weekend is out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, it was phased in a very confusing fashion.

The name of the Facebook page was "A Real Marvel Fan Always Stays Until After the Credits" or something along those lines. It irritated me because it implied that the difference between being a "real fan" and a "filthy casual" was about two or three minutes of the viewer's time, rather than a genuine interest in the characters and their stories, y'get me? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey /r/Iran, thanks for participating in this exchange.

I'm curious t'know how Iran's treatment of Bha's is regarded by the average Iranian citizen. Their most fundamental human rights are clearly utterly disregarded by your government. Does this resonate in any way with most Iranians, or is it something that isn't discussed? Why/why not?

Thank you again for participating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 'Sup folks.

I'm wondering if anyone could offer me any advice by way of saving my phone's USB port. Data transfer has become unreliable (at best), and now it looks like charging is only possible if the phone is held t'the cable at a slight angle.

I'm open to attaching a wireless charging pad to the device in the hope that this might extend the port's lifespan, but I'm wondering if anyone else can offer any assistance? Any tips at all would be helpful, as getting a new device isn't really an option for me at the moment.

Many thanks in advance folks, I'm looking forward t'hearing all of your suggestions. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Photo Backup - Possible to Maintain Folder Integrity? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-20 18:34:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

So I've accumulated an enormous amount of photos on my devices since I first purchased it, and over time I've sorted them into individual folders on the device. I'm interested in backing these photos up, which is a difficult enough task, but I'm also interested in keeping the photos in their assigned folders, which is proving nigh-on impossible.

Can anybody recommend a way I might go about doing this? Local back-ups are preferred (I'm on a Mac, if that helps), but I'm happy to resort to cloud-based options, if that's all that's available.

I'm really hopeful that this whole folder situation can be helped, it'd save me a *tonne* of work in the long run.

Thank you all so much for your help. :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's nothing inherently disrespectful to the doctors written in this article. All they say is that his son's medical team realized they could do nothing more for him. The focus after that is entirely on the trip, the child's merciful recovery, and how grateful they are for his improvement, long may it last.

Don't get me wrong, I acknowledge that pieces regularly appear in glossy magazines and tabloids and the like outright *attacking* modern medicine in favor of some ridiculous diet, exercise regime, faith healer, or other "alternative" treatment, but there's none of that here, that I could detect anyway.

As for the doctors themselves? They've undoubtedly worked very closely with the child over the five years of his illness, I'm sure they'd be just as relieved as his family to see him well again, regardless of how or why that's come about. </TEXT>

Needless t'say I looked like an alcoholic in training, but sadly I gave up on that dream when my class was moved to a new prefab without sick a recycling bin.

<TEXT>  Women don't give a shit about men's feelings unless they are feelings about women's feelings.

It's pretty clear that he's talking about *all* women here, regardless of a man's relationship with them, and the three of us have said that not all of the women in our lives are like that. I'd think most people in relationships are, in a sense, reluctant to share *everything* with their S.O., due to fear of rejection.

It's not a gender issue, it's a *people* issue, and the objective is to surround ourselves with *people* who value us and will listen to our struggles, and to eventually engage in and nurture a relationship with one such *person*. The price of this is the time it takes to wade through and weed out those people who don't value us and/or assist us through our difficulties, and then do the same for those who will. It hurts finding out someone doesn't value you as much as you value them, but this is a practical pitfall of paying the aforementioned price. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 40, or thereabouts.

I got up at 08:00 the day of my grandad's funeral, attended said funeral, skipped the afters (not that I'd've been going anyway, t'cut a long story short) and headed straight back to college to put the finishing touches to my final year project's thesis, which I did overnight in all alone. I also had a piece I'd written for a magazine due for completion, so I did that too, picked up some comic books to reward myself, and headed on home again, but I don't think I hit the hay 'til about midnight or thereabouts, maybe even later. I think I slept for about fourteen hours or so afterwards.

In all honestly I'd do it again, it was nowhere near as bad as the bouts of genuine insomnia I've suffered over anxiety and related issues. The difference between "can't sleep" and "won't sleep" is a chasm you don't take so lightly once you've stared across it with your own bleary, unfocused, and bloodshot eyes. </TEXT>

Also, my brother's home for the weekend. We get along really well these days (sometimes I feel like he's the only person around that I can hold a sensible conversation with!) and I'm starting t'look forward more and more to catching up with him whenever he's home, as well as his Facebook messages and the like.

<TITLE> CM 12.1 on Moto X XT1052 (2013) - At this stage I can't not go for it, but first I've some questions... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-25 01:07:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm fairly certain that CM 12.1 is the way to go on my European variant 2013 Moto X, but I've a few questions first:

1) I flashed Faux Kernel onto 4.4.4 some time ago, and understand that this may be a problem. I'd happily jump through the hoops of reverting to stock before flashing CM 12.1, but Motorola have linked me to an XT1053 .zip instead of the XT1052 .zip, which I'm going to need, right? How do I go about attaining the correct .zip, or will this be necessary?

2) With regard to backups, I've made a NANDroid in TWRP, but would like to be able to restore my apps and their relevant data in CM 12.1, including contact details, call logs, and text messages. Would I be right in saying that Titanium Backup is insufficient for this task? If so, what alternatives should I apply? Is there a separate solution again for the various pictures (saved from the web, photos I've taken etc.) on the device? I really don't want to sacrifice any of this data...

Major thanks to anybody who can help me out here, if there's any more information that might be of help I'll do my absolute best to provide it.

I'm looking forward to jumping aboard the CyanogenMod hype train! :-P </TEXT>

He dutifully carries out The Patriots' orders to his last breath, offing Liquid, Solidus, and Ocelot/Liquid Ocelot, to protect the otherwise disgraced U.S. government from humiliation, to prevent a rebellion against his masters, and to ultimately protect and assure their ascension to total global domination, respectively.

His adversaries are extremely well constructed characters because of this, of course; we, as players, can eventually "get behind" them and their motive, which all serves to create an extremely engaging experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it was last Tuesday or thereabouts. I was listening to a live performance of Coldplay's *Fix You*, and in the middle of it, just before it picks up, Chris Martin asked aloud if everybody was okay. I just lost it. He leapt off the stage and into the crowd hugging random individuals all throughout the solo, and made it back on stage just in time to help the audience finish singing while he wrapped up on the piano.

It turns out this is something he seems to do at most gigs, and I can't help but think that it's a really sweet gesture.

I've a strong interest on oceanography, but my background in biochemistry/molecular biology has left me a little on the outside, so I have to ask: how useful have [those escaped rubber duckies]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Floatees) really been? I can imagine them being useful to some extent, but also can't help but feel that they eventually became a bit of a joke in the field, no?

Also, what kind of molecular techniques have been applied to your work? Would you ever use DNA fingerprinting to identify a particular group you've been following, or is it still all down to the tags?

Thanks again for taking part in this AMA! </TEXT>

The warm weather today got me thinking about it, but I realize that it's not a straightforward as getting a few strips on your roof and watching the electricity bill fall through the floor...

What kind of experiences have y'all had with solar? What benefits have you reaped, exactly, and were there complications getting things off of the ground? Finally, I suppose I'd be open to suggestions of an installer, and relevant pricing estimates won't go amiss.

Huge thanks in advance, folks, here's hoping we see plenty of solar-suited weather this summer. B-) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We don't need to defend feminism; we need to keep the egalitarianism and throw the feminism away.

Soon, perhaps, but I can't agree that feminism was "always" about the supremacy of women above men. Fighting for the right to vote, equality opportunities, and legal protection where it was otherwise denied are all worthy battles, which were perhaps waged under an unfortunately-titled banner, one which has allowed the once-noble fight to devolve into demeaning wars against "stare rape," preferential employment over those best qualified in order to fix quotas, and the complete, utter, and unquestioned infantilisation of intelligent and fully capable women.

The language, as you see, is all very important. </TEXT>

Even more so, Solidus Snake: he sought to destroy The Patriots and restore the U.S. to its former glory and ideals. Everything he did was toward that noble end. He would have established Big Boss's Outer Heaven in the heart of Manhattan, and lead his people against their clandestine rulers.

Don't forget to check the box beneath the search bar to ensure you're performing a search of /r/AskReddit topics *only*. From there you can arrange the search results by popularity, size, age, etc. I'd suggest opening each one, hitting Ctrl+F to search within that page, and inputting your key terms; for example, you might search for "my wife had," or "my ex suffered from..." and so on.

If you do search within the page, be sure to load more results from the very bottom of the comments thread, as some of them can be quite large, and have been truncated to expedite the page's loading time. </TEXT>

Not entirely, obviously, but I think proper characterization of Spidey on film would be a much more achievable goal if he spent more time without the mask than with it, y'know?

SpOck lenses are really only a second choice, if you know what I mean. Maybe something Tony Stark develops?

Heck, now that I think of it, maybe Stark could be influential in having him unmask t'the public, just like in the books; he's the trendsetter, after all... </TEXT>

Also, maybe he'd have it off during team meetings and the like. I feel like strategically keeping the mask off of him would allow whatever actor secures the role to apply a greater range of emotional expressions to the character, rather than hoping that appropriate gesticulation was enough for Spidey to develop as a character and personality of his own.

We, the audience, have seen the mask often enough by now to know what it looks like as part of the whole costume, it wouldn't be that great a sacrifice if he appeared without it, for the most part, would it?

<TEXT>  Ther may be shown as a literally strong person - but her character is weak, and her story is patronizing.

I'm currently reading through it, and I'm inclined to agree that the mystery surrounding her identity contributes to a certain lacking in terms of character development. D'you think it'd be fair to say that this story, thus far, has focused more on Odinson than Thor herself? It seems to present his grief (and possible depression?) quite well, as well as his dedication to Midgard and its protection.

I'm not sold on the whole Frost Giant/Malekith team-up; it's absolute **pandering** to otherwise unfamiliar cinema audiences, even though I doubt half of them would have remembered Malekith from his, what, five minutes of screen time in *The Dark World*?

Moving onwards and forwards through the series, so long as it lasts, I'd expect we'll see a wider variety of rogues who haven't yet made a cinematic appearance, and they'll certainly be interesting, but I think the true test of Thor's character development (or lack thereof) will come when her identity is revealed.

<TEXT> It's much worse than that; wherever the mug is, the term "bitch" has become so widespread it hardly even refers exclusively to women anymore. Irritating men are often referred to as "bitches," just as inanimate machinery is, too. I could easily see the mug in question sitting comfortably in a systems administrator's desk, the "bitch" in question being whatever computer was giving him or her the most trouble that day.

The "Boys are Stupid" memorabilia, on the other hand, is a clear and distinct incitement of violence, against boys. No, not men, but *boys*. Children.

Is there really any ambiguity as to which of the two is worse?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  "Not all feminists have any idea what feminism actually is and prefer to just don the title without spending five minutes even asking what the title means."

I was tempted to cautiously disagree with this (to a reasonable extent, of course), but then recalled [this Fusion.net piece]( http://fusion.net/story/105401/new-feminist-thor-is-selling-way-more-comic-books-than-the-old-thor/?utm_source=twitter utm_medium=social utm_campaign=socialshare utm_content=desktop+top) erroneously declaring the new Thor a feminist simply because she's a woman.

Not all women are feminists, just as some, arguably many, men are. Sadly (or perhaps thankfully) many so-called "feminists" subscribe to radically different definitions of feminism. This is where the MRM must define itself; MRAs have the opportunity to very clearly separate ourselves from PUAs and the Red Pill "community," such that it is. If we maintain this clarity over our use of language, we're half-way toward the important goal of defending ourselves from false accusations against the movement's goals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not actually Thor, that's [Beta Ray Bill](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/2xa0fu/discussion_my_metatheory_about_hickmans_avengers/), a Korbinite warrior who once wielded Mjolnir with such skill that Odin forged him a war hammer of his own, *Stormbreaker*, securing him as an ally of Asgard ever since.

His cameo appearance in *Guardians of the Galaxy* last year has been widely debated. I don't care what James Gunn says, **[headcanon says he was in the film](http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Was-Beta-Ray-Bill-Guardians-Galaxy-Here-What-James-Gunn-Says-68305.html)!!!** </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Edit: and to be clear, it's a reference to the "Killing Joke", where the Joker shoots her and leaves her paralyzed. The cover is a throwback to that particular aspect of their history.

... A story widely credited with starting Babs on the path to becoming Oracle, arguably one of the greatest assets to the Bat Family as a whole. Barbara's role as Oracle was an unrepentant display of her strength of character; she showed willpower to rival that of Batman himself in "standing up" after being gunned down.

Had the SJWs/RadFemiNazis of today been aware of this story back in 1988 she likely never would've served as Oracle, leaving the readership at large deprived of her inspirational strength and unrivalled determination. It begs the question: What watered-down pseudo-stories are the genuine readers of today going to be fed once these GamerGater Haters have packed up and gone home? </TEXT>

She then became The Oracle, one of Batman's greatest allies in his family's fight against crime, effectively "standing up" having been gunned down.

<TEXT> While this is a horrific double-standard, I've heard it explained that an overweight person who fails to reign in their weight is betraying a lot about the personality, whereas a "short" male (it's relative, I suppose) simply cannot grow taller without some dangerous and painful surgery.

In other words, if you've some perceived "flaw" that you can't change, that's where your so-called "flaw" begins and ends, whereas a flaw that you can change, but don't, is very telling about the rest of one's personality.

The truth remains, however, that putting someone down over something they can't change is low, and oftentimes inexcusable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is probably a gross oversimplification, but essentially when someone experiences a traumatic incident anything that could potentially remind someone of said incident, or cause them to experience a flashback, is referred to as a ["trauma trigger."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger)

For example, a child who was rescued from a house fire might be "triggered" by seeing a lit fireplace or stove. A person who suffers a sexual assault might be "triggered" by another person's future sexual advances upon them.

Unfortunately, the term has become something of a parody of itself, with certain self-styled social justice warriors claiming to have been "triggered" by extremely small issues, sometimes non-issues entirely.

You'll often see a notice offering a "Trigger Warning" toward the head of articles dealing with certain issues, but a true trigger can be difficult, if not nigh-on impossible, to predict and warn of in advance.

Hope that's cleared things up for you! :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My inner conspiracy theorist worries that you might be right, which is why thus sub, its members, and the MRM as a whole must maintain a strong commitment to the dual roles of separating radical feminazis from actual feminists whilst simultaneously moving forward in the protection of men's rights.

I've said it before here, but language is a fickle foe in this field; we can educate our detractors by separating the MRM from the PUAs and that Red Pill crowd, but if a radical feminist tries to bait this sub s/he gets the same label as a true feminist who'd do no such thing, and consequently the two are "lumped in," so to speak, together.

Diversifying a cause mightn't seem like progress, especially when we run the risk of watering it down, but sometimes the dead weight needs to be shed. Christina Hoff Sommers' [equity feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_and_gender_feminism) movement is an excellent example of this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was cautiously checking out a girl in the gym between exercises, and had to supplement my use if the leg press with my own efforts w using free weights, as the former was broken. This brought me t'the same area as the girl I'd checked out earlier, and she apologetically interrupted my routine to correct my technique and explain exactly what I needed to do to avoid damaging my knees.

In my stunned stupor I thanked her gruffly and corrected myself as per her instructions, but I made certain to thank her properly when I saw her leaving. We exchanged pleasantries (names, no numbers) and she even offered t'show me how to use an alternative machine t'the leg press in the weights area, which I'd ordinarily try to avoid. I declined her generous offer, as I was in a slight hurry, but also would've liked to have had something to talk about with her the next time I saw her.

Anyway, that was two months ago, or thereabouts. Hopefully one of these days she'll be in around the same time as my good self. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My uncle interviewed for an interview when he was 21, and out of everyone sitting opposite him one guy became *obsessed* with his relationship status. He more or less opened by asking my uncle if he was married (!), and then whether or not he was engaged, and then whether or not he was seeing a girl, until eventually my uncle asked the guy why any of this was relevant, and the guy's colleagues had him back off.

They might've wanted t'suss out whether or not he planned to stay with the company, or if he was "free," so to speak, to leave when the whim took him, but the guy might've also been betraying some kind of homophobic attitude too.

<TEXT> This might be obvious t'you already, but you'll definitely want to take lighting into account, and bit just for the books themselves; if you're including television shows, colourful ones like *Spider-Man* and the like from the nineties should be fine, but darker shows like the *Batman* series from the same era will be much more visually appealing in a darker room.

<TEXT> I really don't think the focus should be on the fact that "hundreds of women" are throwing him a party; is that not just the (mainstream?) media perpetuating a myth against men? That that's what men want?

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure he'd be delighted with all of the female attention, just as women are flattered to receive (positive) male attention, but I'm sure that first and foremost he appreciated how acceptant society is of him as a whole, men and women, right?

Just because a woman is organizing the event doesn't alter the fact, for better or for worse, that this whole story is about common human decency. </TEXT>

Pretty much sums up my approach to hitting women, TBH; whatever your political ideals or viewpoints, it's never okay for anyone to hit you, and anyone under assault is well within their rights to defend themselves against their assailant, regardless of gender.

Obviously sports like MMA (which I admit to being woefully ignorant in) lie outside of this, but it's an interesting take on what she's essentially saying here, I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that in trying to avoid confusion they just ended up creating far more than was necessary. I mean, the 2012 film *steamrolled* the Connery/Thurman effort, as well as the show it was based on.

That said, I think it could've set a precedent for the apparent naming scheme we're seeing in the MCU. For instance, we saw *Iron Man*, *Iron Man 2*, and then *Iron Man 3*, but neither the *Thor* or *Captain America* films adopted numerical identifiers, instead opting for sub-titles to distinguish them as different films. Heck, even Cap's first outing got a sub-title. We're seeing this again with *Age of Ultron* rather than just *Avengers 2*.

I imagine the idea is to add longevity to the film's, because realistically any "4" placed next to an *Iron Man* title card at this stage is bound to look a little rusty. By using sub-titles, each film gives the impression of a self-contained story, and doesn't have to rely upon its predecessors, sequels, or build-up.

In conclusion, as irritating the the alternate title may have been for *The Avengers*, in the long run it may have kept more in line with the titling system for the MCU.

I do wonder if *GotG 2* is going to be retitled at some point, though... </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This probably also makes the MRM a lot weaker...

Perhaps in terms of numbers, but in reality offers us a greater clarity of discourse. For instance, going by the true definition of feminism, the MRM *is* feminism. The problem is that people equate the true meaning behind and goal of feminism with radical feminism. Mary needs feminism so her job is protected while she tries to conceive, whereas Sarah "needs" feminism because [teh sH1tL0rd paytreearkhy iz spredding raep kulchure](https://imgur.com/gallery/4NOQk).

Both women in the above cases are termed feminists, one is legitimate, the other an absolute lunatic. One is going to bring the other down with her, and no amount of #notallfeminists hashtags are going to make any difference.

The MRM, on the other hand, possesses clear and distinct terminology separating its goals from those of pick-up artists and those who push their red pills. We could bloat ourselves with their ranks by allowing their ideas a place on this sub's front page, but that would "blur the lines," as it were, between their goals and our own.

We're fortunate, in a sense, that we can explain away a lot of accusations against MRM with the use of clear and concise terminology; we can explain away the red pill and PUAs as just that, a different "movement," whereas a true, genuine feminist has to break down his or her entire belief set as being separate from those of someone also calling themselves a feminist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Global economics - I'd this absurd idea that we had modern-day treasure hunters digging for chests buried by pirates years ago, and at the end of every working day my dad and his colleagues would walk through a checkout-like system, only *they* were the ones receiving the money, said "money" being handfuls of gold coins, gemstones, scepters, crowns, you name it.

It never occurred to me too actually take a look at this treasure, I just assumed Dad managed that as he did everything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I seem to remember someone here mentioning the possibility that The Living Brain could be somehow involved. I was thinking about this not too long ago, and maybe it was just how dark my bedroom was right before I fell asleep, or it might've been my half-dreaming mind at work, but I'd a really vivid idea as to how it could be presented in the books:

So The Living Brain does something that earns Pete's gratitude, just something small (like welcoming him home from Spider-Verse) and Pete gives him a big ol' slap on the back/side, or even a comical hug. Anyway, the thud on Living Brain's tri-titanium shell is shown, close up, on the far-left of a two-page spread, with nothing but a hard blackness (maybe displaying three lighter black "layers?") from there over to the far-right, where we see some bubbles floating upwards through a sliver of turquoise soup. The following page opens with a close-up on a closed eye, protected behind a goggle, with the sound of the muffled "thud" from three pages earlier  visible just behind it. The eye opens, large, wide, and alert, surveying its surroundings before it, and the reader, realise that it's the foetal body of Doctor Octopus, suspended in a tank of amniotic fluid *inside The Living Brain*.

Whether that's Ock's *actual* body, or just a clone he was growing (based upon the original, which he himself may have commandeered?), I guess that might make for a pretty intense mystery, and the consciousness piloting said body might be another story, but I think this'd make for some really amazing imagery, especially as a cliffhanger.

Anybody got any thoughts on this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That show she did about weight loss? I mean, I agree with her in that there's a lot wrong with the whole body acceptance movement, but she's going the entirely wrong way about showing that.

You don't need a degree in biochemistry to know that caloric input should roughly equal caloric output, and it's generally accepted that different body types *do* exist, but the psychology behind weight management is probably the single most important aspect of that challenge that exists. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Atheism is the lack of belief in gods and nothing else.

That's more of a textbook definition, I think, than the understanding of atheism adopted by the masses, including many atheists themselves. In actuality, many self-proclaimed atheists tend more towards [anti-theism]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitheism) and (preferably, IMHO) [humanism]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism).

I don't know what this man's understanding of atheism is or was, but a hate-crime doesn't have to depend upon one's own beliefs - if I remember correctly, Elliot Rogers (the Santa Barbara shooter) passionately hated Asians, even though he himself was half-Asian. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Pretty much what the title says, really. Has anybody converted (or, more realistically, partially converted) their home lighting to LED? If so, how did you go about it? More importantly, has it brought any side effects? I know they had a reputation for being "colder," as they say, a number of years ago, but that problem is largely behind us, no? Perhaps most importantly, has the investment paid off? Aside from the bulbs lasting longer, have you noticed a decrease in your electricity bill?

Finally, any advice on where best to source the bulbs would be great. Online ordering would be preferred, although I wouldn't be opposed to visiting a brick-and-mortar store if anyone can recommend one.

Many thanks in advance folks, I'm looking forward t'hearing your suggestions soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I finally bought myself a Nexus 7 tablet, and I've come up with a *lot* of questions while flashing custom ROMs and tweaking the settings of various kernels, so many that I should have a list as long as my arm by the time the usual Moronic Monday thread shows up on /r/android. It'd be a really amazing implementation of the [RemindMeBot](http://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/), for example, if I could ask a question somewhere here in RES and have it post to the relevant weekly thread once it shows up, all I'd have to do is wait for a post to my inbox.

I appreciate that this has pitfalls - I've managed to solve half my issues myself since encountering them, original research should be strongly encouraged when a problem first arises - but I feel that the benefits definitely outweigh the advantages. Responsible use of this feature (i.e. editing a question yourself if you've found an answer, for example) could also be strictly enforced where possible.

What do we think? Is this a feature we could see implemented at some point? </TEXT>

I was wondering if anything had changed since then, and what we're using to manage our money online. I've been investigating [BillGuard](https://www.billguard.com/), but I haven't had much luck finding anyone with home I could compare notes.

Any information is useful, hopefully we can initiate a useful discussion. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Big Boss and Skull Face - Handling their Soldiers. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-26 19:08:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I noticed in the E3 2013 Red Band trailer that Skull Face was quite light handed, for want of a better way of putting it, in approaching his soldiers. I imagined that this was just an aspect of the character, the appearance he'd created for himself, until I saw Big Boss himself moving in a similar fashion in the recent *Quiet but not Silent* trailer. I've included the two below, earmarked at the relevant times, for your consideration:

[E3 2013 - Skull Face's movements.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL4ZxDWLwpM#t=6m51s)

[*Quiet but not Silent* - Big Boss's movements.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B94LZ1a-3To#t=1m40.73s)

There seems to be a similarity with how delicately each man approaches his own soldiers, and I was wondering if this was some kind of technique. Obviously neither man wants to startle anyone who's armed, right?

Please feel free to post any possible theories/explanations below, I'll be happy to read through them all. :-) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Three Quick Questions - The Dot View Case... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-21 02:28:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

As the title says, I've three quick questions I'm hoping can be answered briefly:

1) Does the case in question hinder the famed Boomsound speakers? If not, is there a way for interacting with music via said case? I'm open to suggestions that involve Xposed/other root options.

2) Does the case interfere with the camera in any way? I've imagined that a vertically opening flip case would be a much more ergonomic idea than the current horizontal one, but then again the opposite case is likely true for people who typically flip their phone horizontally for photographs.

3) Has anybody experimented with wireless charging? For example, would a Qi receiver fit neatly between the phone itself and the case's back, or is it likely to protrude?

Many thanks /r/htcone, I'm looking forward to hearing if anybody can answer my questions! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Guardians of the Galaxy - So who exactly sought what? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-07 02:20:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, quick question.

In *Guardians of the Galaxy*, we presume Thanos sought The Orb for the Infinity Stone contained therein, and we also assume that he seeks the other five. As Ronan was in his employ, we know that Ronan sought The Orb for Thanos, in order to fulfil his part of their deal.

This presents two questions:

1) What did The Broker want with The Orb? Who was he tasked with acquiring it for? We know it wasn't Ronan, although it may still have been Thanos. Whether or not he knew it held an Infinity Stone is still unknown.

2) What did The Collector want with The Orb? He knew it held an Infinity Stone, that's for sure, and he's also in search of the other five. This makes it unlikely that he sought The Orb for Ronan, but he may still have been in league with Thanos.

It's been a while since I've seen the movie, so bear with me if some details have eluded my memory, but any theories or debate on the query would be more than welcome. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Twitter desktop and mobile clients - a couple of quick questions. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-06 23:15:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all,

I've never been what you could call a serious Twitter user, but I'm hoping to change that soon.

My question mostly concerns desktop Twitter clients; I understand Tweetdeck is a shadow of what it was, but is it really my best option? Is there an alternative which could rival Tweetdeck's glory days?

If not, that's no problem, but I would like to know if there's a way for me to create a column which feeds me relevant hashtags from a given region; ultimately, I'd like to select:

 Add Column - Trending - Trends: United States of America - City: New York

And stop there, without having to select a hashtag specifically trending in New York. I feel like this would be a great way to give me a good overview of what's trending in New York City, with another column for, say, Dublin, Ireland beside it. This would be a great way to get a general overview of the city, and I'd be better able to keep up with friends who have gone abroad.

Secondly, I'm wondering if the official app in Google's Play Store is really my best option for mobile tweeting. I'm happy to wait if a dev is rumoured to be in the running for more tokens, and if so any guidance would be appreciated. Many thanks.

Finally, I'm curious as to what this news is about a "filtered" feed? Is this an experiment similar to what Facebook performed recently? Or a move away from a chronological timeline of events in my feed? Many thanks for any explanation.

Thanks again for taking the time to read this post, I'll be looking forward to hearing any advice seasoned Twitterers can offer me.

<TITLE> Bag Question - Peter Quill's from Guardians of the Galaxy </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-05 21:08:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all.

First time posting here, so I'll get straight to the point; I really liked the look of the shoulder-chest bag Chris Pratt's character, Peter Quill/Star-Lord had in *Guardians of the Galaxy*. It looked comfortable, practical, and stylish, basically everything I've been looking for in a satchel/messenger bag but have never been able to find. I wondered if anyone could provide me with any information as to what bag this was? I've included some photos - they mightn't be 100% movie accurate, but they should hopefully be enough to jog the memory of anyone who may be able to help.

1) [This](http://marveltoynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Star-Lord-Hot-Toys-Accessories-MMS255-e1406129291314.jpg) is probably the best image, it shows him wearing it to the right and the bag itself to the left.

2) [This one](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OJs4io-ROis/U8s32Pasm-I/AAAAAAAAjgY/PDtZBx6qPCE/s1600/San+Diego+Comic-Con+2014+Exclusive+Guardians+of+the+Galaxy+Star-Lord+Hoodie+by+Marvel.jpg) is also quite good, it's based on a hoodie Marvel is releasing.

3) There's also [this one](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EIWrMqzv6wk/U5ZyjZoCPnI/AAAAAAAAJEo/bzdzlprK6OM/s1600/IMG_4061.JPG), a good overview of the bag closed. The blasters would be a welcome accessory, but aren't necessary.

4) Finally, [these](http://www.gq.com/images/copilot/entertainment/201408/1406910558573_01-chris-pratt-peter-quill.jpg) [two](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tzHqqHzBFt0/U9-tzBoXDhI/AAAAAAAAHXw/D8jxUAtTcjA/s1600/140801113451-guardians-of-the-galaxy-chris-pratt-082014-story-top.jpg) are screenshots from the film itself, although they don't appear to show the second strap, which is a feature I quite liked.

I'm looking forward to hearing if you can guide me to either this bag itself or something reasonably similar. Many thanks in advance /r/malefashionadvice. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all, quick question.

A number of months ago I was using a Lumia 720, WP 8.0, and began to experiment with Rudy's excellent 6tag. i was very pleased with the first image I took, but never posted it to my Instagram account due to initial confusion over sharing with other social networks, followed by a battery drain.

Having used Instagram's official Android app since, I see that completed images are saved to the device before upload, and was wondering if this was true for WP 8.0 too. Does anyone know of a way I might retrieve this image from the phone, or indeed whether there's any possibility that the image is still on the device? Any information at all would be helpful, as I would really love to have this photo back; the associated memories are beyond precious to me.

Just started using PushBullet this evening, it's an amazing app with incredible potential for me.

This problem seems to be exclusive to running Chrome in Full Screen mode.

Clearly this robs the app of a great deal of its potential, and if anyone can recommend a fix that'd be hugely appreciated, many thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Google Now Always Listening - Nexus 5 vs Moto X </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-05 17:15:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all!

I'm a little confused about the Always Listening feature of Google Now, and it's been keeping me on the fence regarding the two phones above. I was under the impression that the Moto X shipped with an low-power core used exclusively to listen for commands. The reason the Nexus 5 didn't have this, as I understood it, was because it lacked such a core, and enabling any sort of Always Listening for the phone would ramp up processor use, and therefore battery consumption.

I'm now reading that the Nexus 5 *does*, in fact, possess such a core, which changes things entirely.

If anybody could offer a clear and concise explanation as to what, exactly, the reality of the situation is, I would be most appreciative. Any further input on the two phones mentioned above would also be helpful, specifically in reference to ergonomics - I've heard great things about the Moto X, but having held a Nexus 5 for the first time today I'm quite impressed...

Many thanks once again,

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all!

I've been thinking lately about how the Internet, originally designed as a robust communications system, may well be dividing society at large, due to inherent societal behaviour. With Google monitoring users to "improve" feedback, how great is the divide from one individual to another thought to be?

I'm also interested in studies which identify social media usage as such a dividing factor. For instance, sharing content via Facebook/Twitter may seem like a way to break down barriers formed by Google's habits, but is it likely that those users are isolating themselves based upon their own social stratification?

Any material, simple or complex, will be of great interest, and I thank you in advance for your time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all, quick question as per the title.

I'm wondering how nicely XBMC plays with HDMI passthrough. For example, if I'm running XBMC (either in Windows/Linux or as a standalone Linux-based OS) on a HTPC, with a HDMI leading into it from the HTPC and out of it to the television, will I be able to select to play the PS3 via XBMC? If, for instance, the PS3 is left in standby mode, will selecting it in XBMC wake it up?

Sorry if this question comes across as unclear, I'll be happy to clean up any inadvertent confusion, and I'm grateful in advance for your input and assistance.

<TEXT> Hey all!

My question's in the title, really. I'm wondering what hardware/software combo you knowledgable folks would recommend for the aforementioned task. Obviously I'd require something with decent recording quality, but the battery life of the unit in question would need to be fairly heavy duty. Aside from recording several hours straight, it'd also need the stamina to receive push e-mail throughout the day. Basically heavy use for twelve hours at a time, really.

Finally, if there are specific apps anyone could recommend for the task of creating quality audio recordings I'd thoroughly appreciate the advice. Free is preferable, but I'm willing to pay for the best experience, if necessary.

Many thanks for your input, I'm looking forward to reading all of your responses. </TEXT>

Whose rival is he? Why is he living a lie? I mean, he's working alongside Big Boss, the only man he's ever actually been true to in his loyalty. I know it's difficult to keep tabs on Ocelot due to his nature as a double/triple agent, but the one ultimate truth throughout the whole series about the man has been his loyalty to Big Boss.

Apologies if this has already been discussed to death, I was away during the initial trailer reveal and I can't seem to find the search button with the new (and thoroughly beautiful) layout, so if anyone could point me in the direction of further discussion that'd be much appreciated. </TEXT>

I mean, c'mon, maybe you could downplay his involvement in Bikini Atoll, but the guy's since been exposed to large doses, and hasn't seen any negative effects. Or has he?

A symptom of radiation exposure which BB himself mentioned is thyroid cancer. Some of his friends from Bikini Atoll went on to develop this illness, as mentioned in the second paragraph of [this](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Boss#Early_years) article. A symptom of thyroid cancer may include [changes in voice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer#Symptoms)...

How extreme are these changes? I can't say for sure, but a quick glance at the literature seems to indicate that it may become [hoarser](http://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/thyroid-cancer/thyroid-cancer-symptoms) and [cracklier](http://csn.cancer.org/node/190723), and [tired more easily](http://blog.voicewize.com/2011/08/18/minimally-invasive-thyroid-surgery-voice/).

Whether this would be enough to warrant Hayter's replacement is unclear. I mean, I didn't think you could get much growlier than Hayter without going full Christian Bale. I mean, if Kojima *did* want to work this into the story, I'm sure he could do so with DH on board. 

I'm a firm believer that we'll see (hear?) Hayter in *MGSV* (and it'll be about as surprising as Konami's involvement with *The Phantom Pain*), but in what capacity is anyone's guess. 

Anyway, the floor's open to discussion, so feel free to pick apart my theory, I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Interview tips for a biochem grad? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-10 03:42:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all! 

So I've an interview on Monday morning with the P.I. of a clinical bioinformatics lab in a nearby university, and I really want to make it work. I graduated last year with a biochem undergrad degree, and while I do have some experience in bioinformatics (via both taught and research routes), as well as a working knowledge of and thorough interest in computers, I know very little about programming. I am willing to learn, of course.

I've examined much of the material on the lab's website, in terms of both the lab's overall goals and the research interests of individual personnel, and I'll been invited to meet these other researchers over lunch following the interview. I'm wondering is there any practical advice that /r/bioinformatics could offer? Are there any particular topics I should mention, or any that I should avoid? I'm extremely excited at the prospect of obtaining this position, and I'd also appreciate advice on how I should organize myself in the first couple of days (provided I actually get the job!), first impressions being what they are and all that. 

Any additional reading material or well-wishes would be much appreciated, and rest assured I'll be back to let my new favourite sub know how it all went. 

Many thanks in advance! :-) </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-01-21 00:44:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I saw this a couple of times in the last month, and wanted to send it to a friend who's going skiing in a couple of weeks, but haven't had any luck finding it.

Basically it starts out with a group of soldiers visiting a detention camp filled with snowmen. They march the snowmen into trucks, and drive them to a mountain, where they unload them and proceed to savagely beat them with their batons. The snowmen are flattened into piles of snow, leaving a very picturesque mountain, and the following day skiers arrive and hit the slopes, none-the-wiser of the atrocity committed just the previous night...

So yeah, if anyone could help me out here that'd be great! :-) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Proposed merger with /r/metalgear? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-14 17:31:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Anybody think we should merge with/r/metalgear? They're a much smaller and far less active subreddit, we could absorb them quite easily. I see no reason not to, really...

Edit: Okay, so there's been a hugely positive response to this idea from you folks. Meanwhile, over in /r/metalgear, the submission hasn't even been seen. If anybody needed convincing that a merger was required, that's it right there, y'ask me. In the interest of fairness to the other sub, however, I'll wait until 24 hours has passed since making this suggestion, and then I'll get onto the mods of both subs concerned.

Edit 2: Alright, well I've sent each of the two subreddit's mods the following message:

 Hi there Killerzeit/mezzism/SnakeLinkSonic/Deadlypuf/Yen24/Ganonsfoot/dbarts21/DOOMz_illa!

 I'm contacting you regarding an idea I proposed in [/r/metalgearsolid]...(http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/16k2hf/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgear/) and [/r/metalgear](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgear/comments/16k2e4/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgearsolid/) to overwhelmingly positive response; users are interested in the possibility of merging these two subreddits. Specifically, we would like to see the former absorb the latter. 
/r/metalgearsolid would be renamed /r/metalgear, but keep its present look, with the possible addition of crimzind's redesigned subreddit logo as well.

 Users have brought up concerns regarding who the moderator duties should fall to, but I           personally feel that this would be a good opportunity for certain mods to reconsider their interest in the role, and for us to appoint new blood if necessary.

 Please see the discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/16k2hf/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgear/) for  more information, and feel free to contact me with any additional questions you may have, I'll be happy to field them.

 Yours sincerely,

 subject4616

It's all in their hands now, but the fact that this post received over 120 upvotes and nearly fifty comments, and the identical post in [/r/metalgear](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgear/comments/16k2e4/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgearsolid/) wasn't even seen says a huge amount, I think. Also, I've glanced the activity of each mod, and found /u/Deadlypuf's appointment to the position to be most curious, considering his/her overall activity...

Anyway, many thanks to everyone who replied for their input. It's in the mod's hands now of course, but I'll keep you all informed as to any changes as they take place...

Edit 3: I've been invited to become a mod of /r/metalgear... Since we'll hopefully be running that show soon, I just wanna ask; d'you guys accept me to moderate that subreddit? I'll only take the job if you guys would be happy t'see me in the position, otherwise I'll turn it down, no questions asked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In an effort to increase my ratio on a number of well known private trackers, I've been considering uploading my own DVDs/CDs. However, many of these are already available on said trackers, but they have very few (if any) seeders.

<TITLE> Howdy Reddit, any advice on giving an old laptop a new lease on life? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-06-08 21:33:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So Reddit, I'm currently operating from a five year old notebook, packing a 1.73GHz Intel Pentium M processor, 512MB of RAM, Intel GMA 900 integrated graphics, and Windows XP Professional SP2. It's in good condition, but I'm hoping to replace it soon with a more portable solution.

Thing is, I've grown quite attached to the laptop, and I see no reason to retire it to a lifetime of gathering dust when it's still in such good condition. I've been thinking about how I might utilize it, and have come up with a couple of possibilities:

* A network-attached storage server, using FreeNAS in a virtual machine to manage a few terabytes spread across several external HDDs.
* A bittorrent box, to manage the seeding and leeching of all of that free, libre, and open source software! ;-)
* A personal SSH server, to bypass the ol' work filter that foolishly attempts to keep me from my Reddit!
* An XBMC Media Centre.

I'd also consider adding a distributed computing client to it (such as Folding@Home) and possibly Asterisk, the open source telephony project. Upgrading the current laptop isn't out of the question, for example maxing out the RAM, installing a low capacity SSD, and possibly adding an external graphics card

Absolutely any advice on achieving/maintaining my desired setup is welcome, as well as tips about what else I might be able to pump out of the machine. Ideally I'd like to enable Wake-on-LAN, so that the machine isn't wasting too much power when not in use, so if anyone could advise me in that regard it would also be appreciated.

One more thing Redditor's would be qualified to advise me on is what to replace the notebook with. I'd consider a netbook ideal, but feel free to promote your Macbooks, iPads, Dell Streaks and anything else that you think would suit.

Thanks so much in advance, HiveMind, I'm sure you won't let me down!
