<TEXT> Yeah at the start. Then he got greedy. Power and money brings out the worst in people. He was human and he succumbed to temptation. He abused his position and bled the country dry, so all the progress he made, kinda got cancelled out by all the bad he did and even left us in the negative. 
 

You are right, we all need to change for the better. Our country needs to move forward, but we must not forget what happened in the past so that we do not repeat history.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What worked for me and got rid of my dyshidrosis is a potassium permanganate solution that I dip the affected areas in at night for 15 mins before I go to sleep, then Diprolene ointment applied after that, then I apply ointment again after I wake up. And whenever I wash my hands I apply unscented hand lotion to moisturize. Now I only get a flare up if I touch garlic and opinions without gloves. </TEXT>
