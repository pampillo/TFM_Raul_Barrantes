<TEXT> You're confusing thoughts and feelings. 

For example, a thought is: The train is delayed, I'm going to late for work.

A feeling is: FUCK, THE TRAIN IS DELAYED I'M GOING TO BE LATE FOR WORK AGAIN, GODDAMN MTA SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT AND SHOT AT DAWN.

So you can either let out this frustration by complaining on Reddit or you can let it out by kicking the dog. Too many men sublimate their feelings by hurting other people instead of expressing themselves freely. It's the basis for being passive-aggressive, which is one of the absolute worst character traits and not cute in any way, shape or form. 

(As for women, I've found that they are much more likely to simply be passive and play the martyr rather than be passive-aggressive. It's also annoying, but not to the same extent because they're hurting themselves more than they're hurting other people. Though I do suspect this is the reason why you hear about marriages breaking up and the man being absolutely mystified by it - the woman was being passive and a martyr while the man was oblivious to his own bad behavior.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I'm enjoying a book, I either want to sit and read it for hours, or not read it at all. I have a lot of trouble reading only a few pages of a really interesting book at a time - it's frustrating. 

But when there's a book that I like the subject matter or the story but the writing is kind of dull, then reading a few pages here and there really works. 

This is how it goes for me: Pick it up, read a little, feel like I've had enough, put it down, pick it up again the next time I have a few minutes. Lather, rinse, repeat.  </TEXT>

In other words, if you feel anxious a lot, have racing or intrusive thoughts, or can't switch off your brain when trying to go to sleep, then meditation is for you.

This I can agree with.

An African-American woman is almost five times likelier to have an abortion than a white woman, and a Latina more than twice as likely, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

She emphasized that money is often a decisive factor. The median wealth of white households is 18 times that of Hispanic households and 20 times that of black households, according to the Pew Research Center, but **across the board, low-income women have a higher rate of unintended pregnancy and abortion regardless of race.**

<TEXT> Even back in the day people noticed the resemblance being humans and monkeys and sought to explain it.

The Talmud (Berachot 59b) says: If you see a monkey you make the blessing He who changed the creations. The commentators ask: what change was made to creation pertaining to monkeys? The Kabbalist Rabbi Meshulam answers that in the time of the great flood G-d punished some of the people and turned them to monkeys (and elephants). So that is why monkeys look like people because they were once people! This also explains the superior intelligence that monkeys (and Elephants) have over the rest of the animal kingdom.

The Midrash Rabbah (Genesis 23, 9) says: Four things changed in the times of Enosh:   one, the mountains became rocky, two, the deceased began to rot, three, peoples faces became similar to those of apes, and four, people became susceptible to demons.
In Sanhedrin (109a) it says about the generation of the Tower of Babel one third of the people wanted to wage war against G-d and He turned them into monkeys,

<TEXT> but I suspect more people associate Daati Le'umi than Chardal with the phrase "Religious Zionist".

Could be. I often have opinions that nobody else shares.

Over Pesach I heard a speech that mentioned that ROY gave a heter to give away Gaza but once he saw that it didn't accomplish what they said it would accomplish, he rescinded the heter. So that's also why I don't think I'm an RZ. Because in the end, rabbis don't know any better about politics than anybody else. Give a heter, don't give a heter, it just doesn't matter. Reality will do what it wants regardless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No worries!

Before Chardal was a thing, Dati Leumi = "religious Zionist." I have DL cousins and they're largely what Americans would consider MO. But then Chardal got big and co-opted their ideas and made them much more extreme, which I don't agree with at all. 

This describes my opinion fairly well:

It should be noted that the term "mamlachti" also refers to many more moderate religious Zionists, who are willing to accept the "will of the Jewish people" as a consideration when it comes to many other issues such as the secular nature of society. This latter group predates the Chardal movement by decades, and is identified much more with the mainstream Religious Zionist movement than with the Chardal.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chardal#Internal_divisions

So the idea is that even though I ascribe religious meaning to the founding and existence of the State, I believe the government should largely be secular and democratic; a theocratic government would be horrific. I also don't believe that the State is leading to Moshiach coming. Quite the opposite, I'm worried that time is a flat circle and right now it's 2.5 minutes to midnight. So even though technically my views would mostly fit in with DL's, I now associate the concept of RZ with Chardalim. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Are the prayers valid if you don't go use this structure and just use your own?

For most people, no. The rabbis wrote these prayers because they determined that most people would not be able to compose acceptable prayers on their own. If someone was a great writer and spent as much time composing their prayers as the rabbis did, then maybe their version would be acceptable. 

But this is just for the three timebound prayers mentioned. A person can always pray at other times using their own words. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I consider myself a Zionist who is religious and not a Religious Zionist. I say Hallel without a bracha and don't attach religious meaning to settlements. 

For those of us who are not young enough to remember a world before the State of Israel existed, I don't think we can comprehend how world-changing it was for most Jews, and how absolutely incredible that after 2,000 years our prayers finally looked like they were being answered. So how could it be anything but the atchalta d'geula?

And for a while it really seemed like it was happening, but in the past 20+ years things have been going downhill. So what does it mean in terms of Moshiach? I don't know. And I don't know how anybody can claim to know. 

So especially at this point I don't see how being RZ benefits the State of Israel. 

ETA: If you were brought up black hat, it might be hard for you to get but it's really all right to have political opinions that are just opinions and don't have any particular religious aspect to them. </TEXT>

ETA: Check out the ngram viewer. There are pockets of fear in the mid-20th century, but it doesn't take off until at least 1975, which means the youngest Gen X'ers and oldest Millennials. The second wave of fear starts in about 1988, which is probably related to Stephen King's It, which was published in 1986. And now that it's an established thing, it perpetuates itself.

<TEXT> Your sentence construction is awkward and there are too many pronouns that I don't know who or what they're referring too. 

The shacks "stood still." I don't know what that means. Shacks generally don't move around all that much. I thought it meant they "stood silent" until it turned out everyone was shouting.

They're shouting at a crowd that seems to not actually be there.

The "like acrimonious harpies" at the end of the sentence gets lost there.


"This was partially done out of interest" - what was done out of interest?
What homeless? Where'd they come from? Are they the crowd?

I kind of gave up after that. I was too frustrated.

<TEXT> I'm not sure it's possible to write an actual good frum novel - there are too many constraints on what you can say so invariably it's going to come across as stitled and unnatural. But there are two authors who I thought didn't do too badly - Rachel Pomerantz and Ruthie Pearlman. 

There are Israeli authors who might be okay, but it's impossible to tell because the translations are bad.

You should go for it! After all, you should never write a novel in the hopes that it will be published. I see this a lot in /r/writing. People coming in and saying, I have an idea for a novel, where do I get it published? People often answer, but I'm always like, stop putting the cart before the horse. </TEXT>

Alexa Riley 

Lisa M. Lilley

Never heard of these authors.

Catch-22 is highly emotional despite its satirical tone. Most good war novels are. Maybe you don't find too many male authors who write about emotion in the same *way* that women do, but it's still there. 

And of course it doesn't make sense to compare, say, a hard-boiled detective novel with a romance novel. Naturally the expectations for emotional levels will be different.

ETA: I have Regeneration by Pat Barker on my to-read list. It's clearly meant to be emotional as it's about "confronting the psychological effects of World War I" but I wish I'd read it already to see if it feels so very different than something a man would have written. </TEXT>

From the article. This is the reason why:

For the Israelis, Lev Ari explains, the local Jewish communities are perceived as different in their customs and in their activities, and there are many cultural differences. When the Israelis were asked whom they felt more similar to, the answer was local Americans, not Jews. The Israelis felt this was the Diaspora Jewry, and they were unfamiliar with all the feelings of Jewish communities in the Diaspora, like the feeling of a minority and dealing with anti-Semitism. They were not used to being a minority or labeled Jews. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There really aren't any writings about it that I know because it's not how Judaism works. There will be the writings on the exceptions. But the exceptions aren't sins, they're part of the rules.

For example, a person is commanded to eat the Passover sacrifice. But if you're ritually impure, you don't eat it. So there you have one commandment dependent on another.

But otherwise, some examples, kosher isn't dependent on Shabbos. Shabbos isn't dependent on who you're married to. Yom Kippur prayer isn't dependent on whether you're fasting or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shulevitz, a rabbis daughter who was raised on the Upper West Side, says her family was initially less than pleased at her choice of a career.

When I went to law school, it was considered a shanda (scandal) because women are supposed to not be seen so much in public. People tried to talk me out of it, said Shulevitz, who is single.

That's bizarre. Perhaps they mean the Upper West Side of Lakewood? I know a million frum female lawyers that are her age and even older. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Disliked the Kept Woman by Karin Slaughter </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-19 15:28:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the longest time I resisted picking up a book by her because I thought "Slaughter" was a gimmicky name for a mystery writer. But I got past that and took out the Kept Woman.

But I didn't like it and couldn't finish it. From the very beginning the writing seemed odd and the dialogue even worse but I thought maybe it needed some times to settle down. But it never did. 

Mysteries are supposed to be fairly breezily written. This was the complete opposite. It just dragged and dragged. Every scene went on far longer than it needed to. It's shocking that reviewers on Goodreads say it moves along at a breakneck speed - what are they comparing it to, War and Peace?

But worse than that are the characters. There seem to be five main characters, four of them women. That sounds cool until you realize that these four female characters have less personality combined than the one male main character. In fact, two of the women were so undefined that I couldn't remember which was which when they were in the same scene together.

And then there was the problem that male character was an emotional wreck but he was so woobified that it was nausea-inducing.

I found out after putting it down that this is the 8th book in the series. Maybe it comes across better if you've read the other seven books but at this point I have no desire to go back and read any of the others.

I am absolutely mystified by the glowing reviews and high star ratings. Do you read Slaughter? What do you like about her books? </TEXT>

There's no dialogue so I'm perfectly happy for them to make up whatever physical details they want so long as they preserve the point of the scene. 

Note that your director can and will override whatever you write anyway, so, basically focus on the best story you can write and don't sweat the details (even the sweaty details).

<TEXT> Or it applies to everyone.

A third category is when an important person does something that causes people to talk  even if it would generally not be considered an Aveirah (Shabbos 51b).  This is considered a Chillul Hashem because people will learn from him. The Gemorah explains that greater the person is the more careful he must be.

According to the SMAG #2 and SMaK #85, however, category three is even if is not an important person but a regular Talmid Chochom whose actions cause people to talk  this too is Chillul Hashem.  These authorities also say that when a Jew does any action that will cause Goyim to say, The Jews have no Torah   this is a Chillul Hashem.

<TEXT>  Possibly minhag hamakom isn't the right phrase, but you get the idea - Americans have one standard of kashrut, Israelis have another, as an American you have to follow the American standard, as an Israeli you have to follow the Israeli standard.

That isn't true. Israel and America are exactly the same - they both have a range from meikil to machmir hashgachas and everybody has to decide on their own what they'll eat based on their community and their own personal opinion.

 I do believe the OU sets the standard for kashrut in America. I haven't been anywhere that the Orthodox community accepted something significantly worse. 

As I mentioned, in New York there are local rabbis who certify places that are open on Shabbos. For the OU this is a big no-no. Most MO people will eat in these places. </TEXT>

First off, this isn't how minhag hamakom works. 

Second, minhag hamakom barely even exists anymore.

Third, there are many other Orthodox hechshers in the US aside from the OU and I'm sure their standards are quite low (one example - certifying a restaurant open on Shabbos). But low standards is not precisely the same as not reputable.

Fourth, this presupposes that one is treating the OU like their rabbi, as opposed to thinking of them as the dudes who happen to put little symbols on your food that make it a-ok to eat. 

Fifth, Americans aren't supposed to follow American rabbis and Israelis, Israeli rabbis. You're supposed to follow *your* rabbi, wherever he happens to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Grand Budapest Hotel. And it's not based on a single book, it was inspired by the writing of Stefan Zweig. 

The end-credits for Wes Anderson's 2014 film The Grand Budapest Hotel say that the film was inspired in part by Zweig's novels. Anderson said that he had "stolen" from Zweig's novels Beware of Pity and The Post-Office Girl in writing the film, and it features actors Tom Wilkinson as The Author, a character based loosely on Zweig, and Jude Law as his younger, idealised self seen in flashbacks. Anderson also said that the film's protagonist, the concierge Gustave H., played by Ralph Fiennes, was based on Zweig. In the film's opening sequence, a teenaged girl visits a shrine for The Author, which includes a bust of him wearing Zweig-like spectacles and celebrated as his country's "National Treasure".

<TEXT> How about turning it around? A lot of men are not interested in what women have to say and are perfectly happy to chew your ear off. If you're quiet, they're happy. They don't know you, they don't want to know you, they're just using you.

While women don't like to see other women being excluded. They're trying to get you engaged in the conversation and your being quiet feels like you're rejecting them. I knew a girl like that once. She had the most fascinating life story and it was like pulling teeth to try to get her to tell it. I came to hate her after a while.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't say I've ever done that specifically, but in general when in any kind of relationship with a person with a fairly serious mental problem, the important thing is to set the boundary that you're not his therapist. Another thing is that no matter what his problems are, he can't drag you down with him. These two things can be tough for a lot of people to insist on, so what you end up with is a non-relationship that you're just going to regret in the end, because you can't save him and he's going to make you miserable. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Bizarre Goodreads recommendation </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Because you liked A Separate Peace by John Knowles, we recommend Swimming with Giants: My Encounters with Whales, Dolphins and Seals by Anne Collet.

Description:

In Swimming with Giants, Anne Collet describes the power and majesty of being close to some of nature's most magnificent creatures. Combining science with a sense of adventure, she conveys the sheer excitement of her work, from riding the tail of a white whale to saving animals harmed by drift nets or toxic spills. 

And recently I read Fobbit by David Abrams, which they recommended to me because I liked Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk by Ben Fountain. That's a logical recommendation but I didn't like Fobbit as much as Billy Lynn, not by a long shot. 

GR's recommendations system needs an upgrade.

What good or bad recommendations have you gotten from GR? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's newborn babies. Parenting starts as soon as the kid has any kind of agency and awareness - that's around 6 months old. People seem to think that whatever babies do is adorable, but you have to start out that young by not letting them pull your hair until it hurts, not letting them hit you or grab your glasses or delicate jewelry, and if they try to drop something on the floor seemingly on purpose, you don't pick it up for them. You tell them, you drop it, you lose it. 

Too many people wait until the kid starts walking or talking. But by then the kid who has learned who is in charge. And if you let them get away with that stuff, it's not you. </TEXT>

If you think that's possible, try reading the book the Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker. It's about situational awareness, trusting your gut, and having the confidence to put yourself first and not worrying that you might offend someone.

For example, if a man comes up to you in a dark parking lot and offers to help you with your groceries, if you don't feel comfortable with that, then don't be afraid to say no thank you and tell him to go away. Don't worry that he might be "offended." Your safety comes before his feelings. </TEXT>

No, it's not the case. The case is that men devalue anything that women are heavily involved with. So once something becomes a pink ghetto, men want nothing to do with it. The solution for this is more feminism, not less, so that men come to see women as true equals to themselves.  </TEXT>

This is mostly for very little children, but it's a good example of what I mean by "bizarre rules": two halves of a broken cookie are not good. A cookie must be whole or they won't eat it.

Another thing is that children should be complex like any adult character - they shouldn't be total brats or total angels.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Institutionalization has nothing to do with being isolated. It's more the opposite. They get so used to being in an environment regulated by others that they forget how to regulate themselves.

In clinical and abnormal psychology, institutionalization or institutional syndrome refers to deficits or disabilities in social and life skills, which develop after a person has spent a long period living in mental hospitals, prisons, or other remote institutions. In other words, individuals in institutions may be deprived (whether unintentionally or not) of independence and of responsibility, to the point that once they return to "outside life" they are often unable to manage many of its demands;

Constructive criticism means being able to explain why you didn't like something. But very often criticisms do come down to personal taste. So the question is, is the author writing for you?

For example, my friend (A) and I critiqued our friend B's novel. We both disliked the opening chapters, but for different reasons. It was a genre that I was very familiar with, but A, not so much. We both offered B ideas for what kind of opening we'd prefer, so B had to decide - was she writing for a more general audience, or for an audience familiar with the conventions of the genre? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was me. 

I don't know what you mean by "knowing better." You and I are are not Rabbi Eliezer, Moshe or Avraham. What they did isn't necessarily something we're supposed to be imitating. And as for Avraham, when Hashem told him to kill his kid, he didn't argue, he said okay and was fully prepared to do it. At Har Sinai we said naaseh v'nishma, not "tell me about it and I'll disagree with the bits that I don't like."

As I said in the other thread, you can certainly question if you want and who's going to stop you, but Judaism does not encourage the kind of questions being implied by the OP of this thread and the other one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems obvious to me, but Pirkei Avos 3:2 might make a good starting point.

Pirkei Avot isn't halacha, it's advice. This is saying that a government, any government, is preferable to complete anarchy. It's not saying that there's anything wrong with replacing one secular government with another through armed revolution. 

Rabbi Chanina, deputy to the kohanim, would say: Pray for the integrity of the government; for were it not for the fear of its authority, a man would swallow his neighbor alive.

It seems to me that one would need to show what heter a Jew has to engage with secular politics in the first place.

Why? If something isn't assur you don't need a heter for it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Joke's on you, I'm not a kind person.

I don't believe in tarot but I've had my tarot read a few times and this isn't how it works. Obviously you can lie and make things up, but the cards actually have specific references and meanings. There were times when my tarot was read and I nodded along in agreement and other times I'd be rolling my eyes at how irrelevant it was. I see it more as being like a stopped clock that's right twice a day rather than the Barnum Effect.

ETA: Similarly, I started reading my horoscope in the newspaper about six months ago just to pass the time. Most of the time it's irrelevant but for three days last week it was frighteningly accurate. Coincidence. </TEXT>

And in the reverse, TV is not interactive. So nobody ever put a picture of themselves doing duck lips on TV. Nobody ever got cyberbullied by a TV program. Nobody ever got doxxed by a TV program.

But people are not fine because of TV. It's one of the contributors to childhood (and adulthood) obesity. The Internet is even worse. That's why it was such a big joke that Pokemon Go actually made people leave their rooms go Outside. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Children's books that were written a long time ago are squarely aimed at children and will generally not be of much interest to adults. It's very different than kids books that are written now that have built in a certain amount of appeal for adults too. 

I think this is mostly about tone. Kids books today are a lot more cynical and knowing, while older kids books tend to be more earnest and innocent.

That said, kids books are short. Even if you don't gain that much from having read them, it's not like you have to spend too much time on them. If it took you "hours" to read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you need to practice your reading. It's a 160-paged kids book. That shouldn't take much more than an hour to read. </TEXT>

<TEXT> God told Abraham to leave his city, Ur Kasdim*, and go to the land of Canaan and that would become his homeland. So while what bh2005 wrote was a joke, the idea is that God chose this particular land for us, and we believe that the land has a holiness to it. It couldn't have been just anywhere or God might as well have just said, you stay right where you are and someday all this will be yours.

<TEXT> Interesting, thanks.

As for topics of conversation, I've eaten with lots of different types of families in Israel and America ranging from Chassidish to MO and everything in between and while right-wingers were far more likely to sing zemirot and have a dvar Torah, Torah was never a general topic of conversations, more like extensive discussions about their social life and what other people are doing. Which is the worst.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Radical feminism tends to go along with smashing capitalism too, so it would look a lot like Sweden crossed with Battlestar Galactica, but hopefully with less war. 

Men and women with equal respect for each other. Women equal partners in business and government. No sexualization. And the main thing would be that people (men and women alike) would feel free to be themselves without any pressure to fit into a neat gender box.

Personally, I agree with feminist Shulamith Firestone who said that the patriarchy stems from childbearing. And that means that until we start growing babies in vats, there will be no way to completely do away with the patriarchy. Even in Sweden more women than men work part time in order to take care of children. 

But even without a patriarchy the world wouldn't be perfect. Utopia is not possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way women dress in Judaism is often dependent on the surrounding culture. In the Bible women wore nose rings. If an Orthodox woman today would have a nose ring, it would be a scandal. Similarly, in Israel there is a group of women who wear burkas and they're roundly condemned by all. However, if they were living in Saudi Arabia, they'd be expected to wear burkas just like the Arab women because Jewish women are not allowed to dress less modestly than the non-Jewish women they're living near.

So I assume it's the same thing with wedding rings. Back in the day women probably wore more rings on more fingers, so wearing your wedding ring on your index finger looked normal. But now that general society doesn't do it, it would look weird if Jewish women did.

But since it's becoming more popular/normal it wouldn't look so bad. Though some people might not realize it was a wedding ring - if you have any interest in people knowing that you're married. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not dying of natural causes, that's dying of a heart attack.

A young person generally cannot die of natural causes. If a young person had a heart attack, that was a preventable problem and therefore is not natural causes.

Simply put, death by natural causes is a death that is not unexpected. It is not from an accident, a natural disaster, a homicide or suicide. It is also one that is not preventable.

http://nursinglink.monster.com/benefits/articles/117-death-by-natural-causes-explained

As the article goes on to say, if a news article reports that someone young died of natural causes, it's to protect the privacy of the dead person and the family. A doctor would never say that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My experience was nothing like sokpuppet1's. Nobody was freaking out or hugging or crying. 

I was on the Q train and had a bird's-eye view of the Towers burning as we went over the Manhattan Bridge. I got off at Canal Street and walked up Mulberry Street to get to shelter, so to speak, because I couldn't get to my office - they weren't letting people south of Chambers Street. 

On Mulberry Street they were setting up for the San Gennaro festival like nothing was going on. Canal Street was a bit of a madhouse, but it always is, so it wasn't too much out of the ordinary. 

The closest I got to the WTC that day was about 10 blocks away. Union Square is almost two miles away. Everybody who was south of Canal that day was probably in shock.

When they finally reopened the bridges I asked a cop if they needed people to give blood and he said no because there were many deaths but few injuries. So I walked over the Williamsburg Bridge and headed home. The buses were free and the weather was perfect. 

That night I couldn't sleep because every time I closed my eyes all I could see was an image of the Towers burning. It was three nights before it went away. But it took a year before I could look at a picture of the WTC without getting upset; my office was four blocks from Ground Zero - we were allowed back in a week later.

ETA: Just read over my journal entry for that day. 

I watched the movie 42 Up when I got home and I liked it. 

The DSL wasn't working so I had to use dial-up to get onto the Internet. 

I almost fainted in a store two days later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. Judaism doesn't have a whole lot of advice on how to treat people who are treating you poorly aside from saying you're not allowed to treat them poorly in return (revenge is forbidden). What that amounts to is "be the bigger person." So if a person is trolling: ignore them, block them, report them to the mods. 

The only people you're required to engage with who are treating you poorly are your parents. And even that requirement has limits.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Am I converting this right? Height: 5'2, goal weight, 160 pounds? If that's the case, then you are obviously right to be dieting and should ignore your mother's hysterics. Plus, not to worry - no hospital would admit you.

At the same time, the important thing is to find a healthy, balanced diet that you can stick to for the rest of your life. Dieting is easy. Maintaining is hard.

I don't know if your mother is a narcissist or just feeling threatened by your losing weight and her not. Why not make an appointment for both of you together with a dietitian and personal trainer? Make it a mother-daughter project? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  at the very least put herself in harm's way

As a police officer or solider you *are* putting yourself in harm's way - but you're doing it consciously, as a choice. And dying in the line of duty is not being a failure unless you actually did something negligent or stupid that lead to your death. 

I just read a war memoir where an armored vehicle was hit by a missile and the only reason why the author survived was because by coincidence he was standing on his seat instead of sitting in it. If he'd have been sitting, he would have died. And that's not being a failure, that's just the vagary of war. </TEXT>

Technically each individual case is not anti-feminist, but in the aggregate they are.

Have her be a soldier or police officer and have her die in the line of duty? In other words, try to make it not the typical cliche of the innocent white woman getting murdered by the vicious but cunning psychopath. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is from the Reform page about Yom Kippur. It sounds like they want to have their cake and eat it too, no pun intended. They describe some actions as sins but then quickly back away and turn teshuva into a general "spiritual" concept.

The Days of Awe are about more than confessing our sins. They are an opportunity to envision our lives and our communities if we each become a little more caring with each passing year.  On Yom Kippur morning, we read from the Torah portion entitled Nitzavim, in which we learn that meaningful Jewish lives are not too hard for us and not too far awayif we are willing to choose a life of caring for each other. We also recite the Al Cheit, a prayer that recounts our sins:  gossip, arrogance, exploiting the weak, and all the other missteps we took during the year just ended. The High Holidays are a time for tshuvah, which is usually understood to mean repentance.  But tshuvah is much more than repentance.  Its literal meaning is return and, indeed, tshuvah is a return forward to something holy inside us that hasnt yet reached fruition, a return to the goodness and the caring that could have been and still can be. Tshuvah is our search to find the potential for good and for holiness that has been within us all along but somehow became hidden in the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

<TEXT> I just finished reading a book that I'd rather not name. It was a memoir about a very difficult period in the author's life. Parts of it moved me, but overall I thought it was weak. I wanted to give it 2 stars but felt bad so I rated it 3 stars instead. I particularly felt bad because my library purchased at my request. 

This is the first time I can remember not feeling comfortable giving an honest rating. </TEXT>

There aren't that many blessings on food and they're short. 

The blessings after food are longer, but you don't have to memorize them - that's what siddurs and bentchers are for. I always carry a pocket-sized siddur. 

After saying the blessings after food a bunch of times you will find that you'll have naturally memorized them. </TEXT>
