<TEXT> That's like asking how they could push through a "healthcare" bill without reading it after screaming for years that a healthcare bill had been passed without being read first.

The GOP long ago abandoned any real pretense of trying to govern in the best interests of the people.  They're nothing more than a racketeering operation set up to funnel money to the already wealthy by exploiting the fears of the ignorant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that Hilary would have been better than Trump, but if you're asking what she did wrong....

-Pushed for the Iraq War without proof of WMDs.
-Pushed for Libya attack without a plan for a peaceful solution.
-Pushed for escalated Syria involvement.
-Pushed for trade deals that harmed US workers.
-Cheated in the primaries.
-Pushed for Trump to win the Republican primaries.
-Supported the Keystone XL pipeline.
-Didn't support a living wage for all workers.
-Didn't support healthcare for ALL Americans.
-And yes, kept a personal, poorly protected, email server over which she sent classified materials.

There are many, many more things she did or didn't do that I believe were wrong and detrimental for the nation.  That doesn't mean she'd be as bad as Trump is now.  Of course she'd be better.  It means she was a lousy choice to put up in the first place. </TEXT>

The real 'genius' (if you can call it that) of this deal is that it'll cost workers far more in taxes and medical bills than $35.00 per year to cover the cost of environmental damage to public roads and other property caused by things like climate change and acid rain as well as the costs and pain from increased pollutants in our water and air causing cancers, breathing problems, deformities, etc...

<TEXT> Jan. 20: Within moments of Trump's inauguration, nearly all references to climate change disappear from the White House official website. While there's nothing unusual about a new administration changing the website, the new language is telling. "President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the US rule," reads the new site's only reference to climate change. "Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years."

I just thought it was interesting to note that in exchange for destroying our water and air, Trump offered each worker in the country a whole $35.00 per year! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Glendale school board is attempting to break off in order to segregate itself from minorities.  This is the finding by the judge in this particular case.  That violates the prohibition created by Brown.  If the judge had not found that the reason for breaking off was due to race, then I'd agree there would be little recourse.  Furthermore, government entities do no have the right to act in a discriminatory manner against discreet minorities unless a need can be shown and the action shown to be as narrowly tailored as possible.  I don't think that saying the minorities would be blamed for not segregating fits those requirements. </TEXT>

IIRC, the belief that black children would be more comfortable with their own race was used to no avail in Brown as well.

<TEXT> In a nutshell, this decision states that yes, the rich, white community wants to shut out black kids - which the judge actually calls "deplorable" - then says go ahead and do that, even though it violates the precedent set by Brown v. Board of Education.  

The judge's reasoning?  The black kids will be blamed if she doesn't violate a major Supreme Court ruling forbidding "separate but equal."

Makes no sense and should be immediately overturned.  After that, the judge should be removed from the bench for racial prejudice. </TEXT>

Also, the crying is starting to look pretty pathetic at this point.  You chose a lousy candidate and she lost to an orange con-man despite cheating in the primary.  That's history.  Grow up and focus on something productive already. </TEXT>

There is no reason or excuse for legalized loan sharking that stands up to the briefest of logical thinking.  They are parasites that have rapidly grown up to take advantage of reduced governmental oversight and a lack interest by either major political party to work towards real solutions.

What Reason doesn't want to acknowledge is that Bernie Sanders provided a real solution to this problem by proposing that Post Offices offer check cashing and basic checking services.  He also proposed expanding Medicare to everyone, which would eliminate nearly all the need to use these legalized loan sharks.

<TEXT> I won't put the responsibility of this entirely on Trump's shoulders since the article stated that the plan to use this bomb had been planned for months, but I do have one question for those who made the call to drop it in Afghanistan.

Was there a specific military requirement for using such a large scale bomb in a country with a mostly scattered population and no large scale military installations?  It seems to me that using a bomb of this nature, in this particular theater, was likely a waste of money, materials, and innocent lives for no better purpose than to show off our military might.  I'd love to be proved wrong on that, but I can't see how a MOAB would be more efficient than smaller, more targeted explosives in this scenario.

If the US used this bomb for PR purposes, every single decision maker, including Trump and Obama if it went that far, should be tried for murder.

There is no measurement realistically possible in which a human being with an ounce of integrity and an elementary education could call it either.

<TEXT> Looks like someone should have taught you the meaning of "irony" as well.

I agree that it is unfair to tax people at different rates based on the services they receive from the government.  However, you are arguing that the poor should pay a far greater percentage of their income on fewer services, essentially supporting the upper classes at a rate ever greater than they currently do.

Do you not see how insanely regressive and unfair that is?  No?  Really?

And you can stop with the bullshit "they don't pay federal income tax" trope as though that was the only tax that counts for some reason.  The poor already pay exorbitant taxes compared with the wealthy and get very few services for them.  You want to make it even worse, a position that is short-sighted, greedy, morally bankrupt, and ignorant.

If you were actually concerned with equality, which you're obviously not, you would support abolishing all taxes other than income tax or wealth tax, which could be applied to everyone at the same rate.  Instead you want a VAT that will disproportionately hit those least able to pay.  That's a rather disgusting position.

If we learn from our mistakes and root out the corruption in our party, we can start winning elections again.

Wasserman and Brazile are corrupt politicians who used the DNC apparatus to prop up a failing candidate who couldn't win in the general election.  They did so illegally and unethically.  Knowing this, we should make sure they and their cronies are kept far away from the levers of power in the party during future elections.  A properly contested primary will give us the best hope of getting the best candidate to challenge the cancer that sits in the white house now.

Or we can chant "Who cares?" in the hopes that everyone forgets what caused us to lose in 2016.  Then we can set ourselves up to lose again in 2020. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the question, at its heart, is what is efficiency?  If efficiency is defined strictly at creating the greatest output with the least effort, then I would agree that automation and a UBI would be the way to go.

On the other hand, what is the purpose of automation and of work?  Are we as a species ready to detach ourselves from the concept that effort equals return?  I may sound a bit primitive or old testament, but I believe that having purpose helps most of us find fulfillment with our lives.  By reducing the number of jobs too much, we end up questioning our purpose and this would likely lead to reaching out for something to fill that gap.  That kind of worries me.

That's not to say that I see no purpose in automation, but I think that with we can create a better world when we work with automation, instead of letting it do all the work for us.

There's also the worry that if we create a society in which a few extremely wealthy individuals have the power to create vast power structures based on automation, there would likely come a point in which they ask what the rest of us are here for and why they should foot the bill for our survival.  Aren't we already seeing the beginnings of this with the constant attacks on medicare, food stamps, the ACA, and other social safety nets?

As such, I believe that efficiency without purpose leads down a frightening path, while moderating efficiency with the promise of a healthy society, one in which people have purpose, is our best bet.

Thanks for a great discussion! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of all the dilemmas I read about here, yours is the possibly the toughest.  To help ensure a happy future, you have to hurt the person you love and make the present miserable.

I'd suggest that your parents likely already know you're living with your partner and their offer of help isn't as altruistic as it seems.  I'm guessing they figure this is the best way to break the two of you up, and they could be right.

Your partner, on the other hand, isn't offering to make a change that would support your future and that says something about him.  People with cold weather dogs and health issues move all the time in the 21st century.  That shouldn't be too much of an issue.

So, based on not knowing many facts about your family and relationship dynamics, I think you have two parties wanting to control your future for their own satisfaction.  From everything you've written, it appears you tend to put other people's needs before your own and that others use your generosity to manipulate your actions for their own benefit.  Your parents want you to live the life they imagined for your, but don't respect your need to forge your own path.  Your partner cries and manipulates you to abandon your possible future so you don't leave him alone.  Are these people really looking out for you?

With all that said, I don't have a recommendation as to whether you should go to San Diego or not.  Instead, I'd suggest you take a good long break from everyone and use the time to ask what's best for you, and for once, you alone.  If these people really love and support you, they will do what it takes to keep you in their lives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a possibility, but if the earth didn't thaw in the summer, the Wildlings wouldn't be able to grow crops of any sort, which would negate the need for creating settlements.  Although there is evidence of some trade, it probably wouldn't be enough to supplement the dietary needs of the populace.

Also, the Wall is supposedly kept frozen in summers by magic, not cold weather.  It weeps but never shrinks in size that I know of.

I agree that the rope being frayed is a clue; however, fraying isn't necessarily a sign of aging, but of being pulled apart by stress instead of cut with a knife.  I think the question to ask is why would it have been frayed and not cut.  It could be due to age or perhaps it was severed by someone who couldn't use sharp implements.  Is there any word on whether the Children use sharp weapons? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funny enough, I just re-read this chapter and was thinking about it as well.

To get to the answer, I think we need to look at the possible players as well as their motivations and opportunities.

At this point the only player we know of north of the Wall are the Wildlings, the Night's Watch, Bloodraven, the Children of the Forest, Benjen, Coldhands, and the Others.  Of these players, the Others can likely be ruled out because they wouldn't likely give the NW effective weapons and they probably wouldn't be able to even touch dragonglass.  The Wildlings are likewise unlikely to give away weapons they could use.  And of course, the NW didn't bury them to give them back to themselves and didn't know of their power to begin with.

So that leaves the Children, Benjen, and Coldhands.  Benjen and Coldhands could be the same person, but either way, he/they are probably dead and reanimated by the power of the Children or the Others, or simply dead and lying under the snow.  It is also very unlikely that Benjen would have known about the power of dragonglass without the Children, and its not very plausible to believe he would have been able to discover their power and gather a sack-full of weapons over the course of the months he was in hostile territory while at the same time trying to avoid Wildlings and Walkiers and find enough food/water/shelter to survive.  Bloodraven is known to be working with the Children and Coldhands is strongly implied to be doing so.  As I wrote above, the Others wouldn't use either Benjen or Coldhands to give weapons to the enemy, so that leaves only the Children/Bloodraven.  

The NW cloak that the weapons were wrapped in wasn't rotted so that indicates it was a newer cloak that would have probably come from a recently killed or still living crow, which strongly suggests Benjen.  

Regardless, I'd say every indication points to the Children leaving the weapons although they could have done it directly or through an intermediary.

If the series is ever completed, we'll see if GRRM came to the same conclusion. </TEXT>

Simply put, you can accept that you're bisexual or gay and be happy or hide it from yourself and be miserable.  Speaking as an older guy who tried to push this side of me aside for several years, I know what I'm talking about.

<TEXT> Having no clue as to who was right or wrong regarding your mental health, it was definitely wrong to diagnose you by text.

As for the best way to move on, I'd suggest a clean cut.  Block his number in your phone and try to avoid the places he tends to frequent, if possible.  Also, resist creating mental stereotypes of older men (or men in general) in your mind.  Not every guy will be controlling, manipulative, or spiteful.  Many will be, but that's why you need to take time when meeting men to separate the wheat from the chaff.

Most of all, don't let this guy continue to control your life by making you resentful or bitter.  Accept that he is a deeply flawed individual, like most of us, who has not dealt properly with his issues and move on.  You were lucky to escape so quickly so be thankful for that and learn from it.  That way you can take something positive from this experience.

Good luck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's not working but he can't find more time that once per week to see you?  He's 37 years old and not out?  He's spending more time with a coworker who's lonely than his boyfriend who's just as lonely?

These are all major points that you didn't mention before.  They don't make your abusive behavior any better, but they do show that he's been abusive of you as well.

While nothing you've written suggests to me that your partner is cheating on you sexually, unless there are reasons you haven't shared, it does sounds like he is being very withholding of affection, which is also abusive. 

In a young/old relationship, there's a thing called the campfire rule.  The more mature party has a responsibility not to leave a mess behind.  Your boyfriend should be helping you navigate the complexities of adult relationships; he shouldn't be playing games - which it appears he is doing.

So again, unless there's more information that you haven't provided, my advice remains the same.  Let him go, for his sake and yours.  </TEXT>

What he did in the past was pretty bad, but we all do things we're not proud of at times.  What is going on now if far more important.

That said, he's not the guy for you and you should never get back with him under any circumstances.  Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to ask how it came up that he'd choose his friends over you.  If you were trying to make him choose, then that was abusive behavior.

Basically, none of what you wrote about your boyfriend's actions sounds improper without more to go on.  How does he talk about his friends and why are you putting the word in quotation marks?  If you truly believe they're really fuck buddies or lovers then you should leave him. 

On the other hand, I took the liberty of reading some of  your other posts last night and it seems to me that the main problem here is that you see each other once a week and that isn't nearly enough for you.  Would I be wrong in guessing that you're really jealous of the time he spends with friends when he could be with you?  

In other words, I'm thinking the problem isn't that he's cheating by having sex with other people, it's that you feel he's cheating you of the time you deserve with him. </TEXT>

You're right, no relationship is perfect and people make mistakes.  Are you continuing to make the mistakes or are you learning from them and doing something different the next time?  If you're repeating the abusive behavior then let him go so he can have a chance to heal.

<TEXT> It sounds like you're an abuser because you admit to being jealous and to accusing him of cheating.  

If you can't trust him, let him go.  Whether he's cheating or not, you don't appear to trust him.

Perhaps you have no idea how soul crushing it is to be with someone who is always questioning you or invading your private space.  Maybe you don't understand why someone would resent constantly having to justify his actions and make excuses for where he's been and what he's done.

Putting someone in that position is emotionally abusive.  If he gave you that list, he obviously believes you've been doing at least some of those things.

<TEXT> No, this is what happens when someone posts a silly meme that is not accurate then tries to change the subject when called on on the idiocy.  You're meme is patently misleading and a mature person would admit this and fix the problem.

To your larger point, is it your honest belief that the wealthy receive the same amount of services from the government?  Do you actually believe that the police and firetrucks show up as quickly when called from a poor neighborhood as they do when called from a wealthy one?  Do you actually believe that the wealthy do not benefit more from our roads even though they own more vehicles for personal and commercial use?  Do you think they don't get more use from our courts when most of a court's time is tied up with civil litigation from wealthy litigants?  Does our military not protect the properties and assets of wealthy citizens at a greater rate than the poor?

On and on, the examples are glaringly obvious that our system works much harder, and more resources are spent, on taking care of those with the most assets.

Yet you're spending your time crying about a few bucks going into social safety nets as though that doesn't benefit the wealthy as well.

Perhaps spending some time figuring out where the money in this country goes and how it supports various classes would help you see where the real problems lie.

Oh.  And quoting Ayn Rand, the woman who cried about the evils of Socialism at every turn before jumping on SSA, doesn't win you many points.

In other words, it's your average Ayn Randian rant about taxes.

Let's make this simple for those who might actually fall for the kind of highschool sophism put forth in the article:

We didn't create social safety nets to be charitable or moral.  We created them because they provide stability, which in turn keeps businesses running smoothly.  When businesses can run smoothly they tend to employ people, which in turn reduces the need to spend on social safety nets.

The alternative is more crime, more prisons, more violence, and more waste.  All of these are much more expensive than properly funding safety nets.

<TEXT> Hey, I'm glad you've started to turn your expectations around; that's an important first step.

As you say, you're graduating from engineering school and seeking a job in SF.  This would probably be a great time to bond with older relatives who can teach you how to cook and how to do basic self-repair.  Those two things will help you go very far and improve every aspect of living.

I won't go so far as to suggest you live off legumes and tap water.  On ~$100k, you can still buy tasty groceries and go out to eat rather often without breaking the budget.  However, if you make eating out a treat rather than a routine, you'll find it far more enjoyable and satisfying.

Finally, it's great that you're planning to dump a decent amount into a retirement account, but I'd also make sure to tuck away some cash in a readily available account for emergencies, because there WILL BE emergencies.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's be brutally honest here....

Seriously, people keep telling you over and over where you're going wrong, but you're not listening.

Either make more money or choose a cheaper place to live.  "Wanting" to live in an expensive location isn't a need, it's a desire.  This isn't a difficult problem to work out.

And as others have pointed out, learn to cook so that you aren't spending $30/day on food.  Again, not tricky.

Basically, it sounds like you want someone to tell you how to pull money out of thin air so you can live like a prince fresh out of college.  

I'll agree with you that you are fucked.  And you'll stay fucked until you learn to live within your means and listen to people who are doing their best to give you good advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I'd strongly suggest you take some time to sort out how you feel about this situation.  Logically, you've already come to terms with the fact that most of us wanted to experience more partners and alternatives when we were younger.  Emotionally, it sounds like you're not there.  That's where spending some time with your thoughts and asking what is really important to you in your relationship comes in.

Second, once you've sorted out your feelings, you need to sit down with your partner and talk about what that means to your relationship.  

If you decide that you can't share him/his body with other partners, then you should be prepared to either end the relationship then, or after you find out he's been with someone else.  He's already made his needs known and stifling him won't end well for either of you.

On the other hand, agreeing to let him see other men while secretly resenting it, will also lead to frustrations and resentment.  Basically, if you can understand and truly accept his needs, you'll be in a far better place in your relationship than if you either deny him or resent him.

Good luck and I hope it all works out. </TEXT>

As for why, he's given you the brush, it could be nearly anything but it almost certainly wasn't your fault.  I'd guess that there was something that didn't click and he wasn't willing to work with it or even give you the chance to address it.  I've seen it many, many times.

Look at it this way, you're a young man in NYC.  There are so many opportunities out there to find someone who will be interested in you for being you, that getting hung up on the one who wasn't is simply wasting your time.  Remember what you said about him moving on from his long-term partner after four years?  I think one year is more than sufficient to move on from someone you've met three times.

http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/268444-dean-labor-unions-are-super-pacs-democrats-like

I donated to Dean's campaign and voted for him in the primary.  He was a great DNC chair who returned us to a 50 state strategy which was instrumental in taking back the House, Senate, and Presidency.  

That said, his conduct while shilling for Hillary was unacceptable to working class voters who still look to Unions to protect their jobs, wages, and health benefits.  He needs to understand the difference between political operations and organizations that support actual people.

If there's one lesson the Democratic party needs to learn from this election its that you can't abandon a large minority of voters and expect them to support you.  There is no indication that Dean has relearned that lesson. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks like there's a groundswell of support for Ellison, which is a very good thing.  We need someone heading the DNC who can remove the taint of corruption and venality that DWS and her cronies left behind (i.e. Brazile).

As for Howard Dean, I supported him for president in 2004 and I think he did a great job as DNC chair before Obama removed him and installed Kaine.  That said, Dean lost all credibility when he trashed Sanders and the Unions while acting as a surrogate for Clinton.  He sold us out to the Clintons for some reason and that makes him part of the problem when we desperately need a solution.

<TEXT> Not with Hillary's unethical and possibly illegal collusion with the DNC, he didn't.

Which is funny, in a morbid sort of way, because it's now obvious that Hillary didn't have a chance in Hell despite all her unethical cheating.

Doesn't that make you feel at least the slightest bit angry that Hillary and her trolls lied to you about everything while they were fucking up our futures? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fuck that!  I'm already tired of reading and hearing "you did this" bullshit.  I didn't do this and you didn't do this.  We all did this.  We did it by allowing the system to get so corrupted that the DNC was able to put up the most reviled candidate in history and convince us that there was no way she could lose.  We did it by ignoring the very real economic problems faced by a large minority of the population.  We did it by allowing wealth to become synonymous with morality.

So some asshole from Slate wants to blame everyone else for Sarah Palin possibly getting a cabinet position.  Again, fuck him.  He needs to look in the mirror and ask why he said nothing before now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard this argument and disagree with it strongly.  There's a faction that wants to make us believe that helping people is a bad thing and that politicians will be punished at the polls for it, which twists the facts.

Democrats aren't being punished for being "uber social justice warriors," they're being punished for the exact opposite - for abandoning a large segment in our society who rightly feel that everyone is getting help but them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you're going to ignore the whole thing where you were completely ignorant of your candidate's basic proposals, huh?  Okay.

First, the operative word is "did," not "does."  Trump did appeal to more voters.

Second, the operative term is "working-class," not "middle-class."  The working-class used to be middle-class when Democrats supported Unions and worker rights in reality, not merely in a two-line blurb on a website.  

Finally, Trump did appeal more to the working-class because he told them what they wanted to hear while Hillary ignored them.  You can cry that he was lying all you like but it doesn't change what did happen.  He won on the backs of the working-class because Democrats have effectively abandoned them for corporate sponsors.

So now you know that Trump is a liar who will sell out the workers the moment he reaches the oval office.  Did that really surprise you?  Hillary did it the moment she started her campaign. </TEXT>

And I never said Trump would increase wages because he won't.  He'll be a complete shit-show and I didn't support or vote for him.  That doesn't make anything you're writing correct.  It just makes Trump a shit-show. </TEXT>

and from her own site...

How can you try to tell others what to believe when you don't even know your candidate's basic platform?

Clinton supported a minimum wage instead of a living wage and that's a fact.  Trump supports getting rid of it but the working class is more concerned living wage jobs than promises of sub-standard wages that might be a little higher than they were. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being pro-worker doesn't mean being anti business, but it does mean being anti-exploitation.  That is the line that has been crossed by New Democrats like Hillary, Wasserman, Brazile, and others.  Healthy workers means healthy businesses.  The advent of the middle class in this country went hand in hand with the Unions and businesses were never so profitable.  The destruction of the Unions led to lost jobs and wages, international mergers, and the general decline of American prosperity.  At least coincidentally, it also corresponded with the decimation of local family businesses that weren't Union.  Probably because of tightening household budgets and incoming non-Union mega stores sucking profits out of communities.

Nothing I heard in Sanders' message was anti-business, but it was anti-exploitation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right.  The working class should have taken what they were given and not get out of line.  Who do they think they are, anyway? /s

On a serious note, it would be good if you even knew your candidate's positions.  She did not support a $15 minimum wage, she wanted $12 and only because people like Bernie made it popular and she had to respond without upsetting her donors too much.  She specifically opposed raising it to $15.  Other than that, she was mostly silent on working class issues.

Oh yeah!  Workers also might want to get paid a little more than entry level wages for the work they do.  How presumptuous! /s </TEXT>

As for the rest of your comment, it's been less than 24 hours since the election was decided and there's already neo-liberal propaganda trying to put the blame on pro-working class Dems.  If you want to castigate anyone, look in the mirror or go snip at them.  Those of us who have been saying this could happen a year ago need to make our voices heard or jump to a new party. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The country just elected a city liberal who recently changed his "core" beliefs.  I don't think the problems is where the candidate comes from and I don't think conservadems are the answer.  Bernie would likely have won last night as he was pulling the same constituency that usually votes Democratic but put Trump over this time.

<TEXT> Clinton took only 51% of the Union vote.  This is what destroyed her in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania where Union support still clings to life.  She thought she had this demographic locked down but they largely abandoned her because she (and the Democratic party) largely abandoned them.

The Democratic party either needs to get back to its roots of supporting the workers or step down so that another party can rise.

Basically, Krugman's a hack who helped get us to where we are today.  Hard to give him, or his Nobel medal, much credence after that. </TEXT>
