<TEXT> Considering how Rattlesnake Ledge is known as the "basic bitch of hiking trails" in Seattle, I think it's rated just about right in my book.

I still like recommending it to folks who want to do relatively little work for an absolutely stunning view. It's also ~~close downtown~~ easy to access from downtown and has a huge parking lot.

edit: Better words. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also got a house in the area for below asking earlier this year. While it's an up-and-coming neighborhood, it isn't as "hot" as other places.

 I take the light rail to work.

This changed my life. I used to bus from Capitol Hill to Pioneer Square... My commute is almost exactly the same, time-wise, from Columbia City to Pioneer Square.

 The Columbia City strip is awesome too, great restaurants.

What restaurants would you recommend on the strip? I always tell myself I'm going to try something new, then end up grabbing a slice at Pagliacci...

I generally like to price my items no less than what it would cost to ship across the country, add some margin, then offer free shipping.

Is there a pricing strategy that's given you more success? Am I eBay'ing wrong? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  noisy and rowdy

These are relative terms... but I'll give my suggestions anyway:

* Bill's Off Broadway is pretty chill. Get their pizza or wings.
* Stout has wide open space, lots of TVs, good selection of drinks.
* Six Arms can be a tight squeeze, but they have amazing tater tots.
* Captain Blacks has a cool rooftop deck, but it can get crowded on a nice evening.

I don't think any of these places have dance floors or live music often, it's pretty easy to hold a conversation and have drinks at all of them.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think we're in a bubble. However, I am curious who the buyers are and how they're paying above asking price... cash (or so claim the articles). Where is this money coming from? Is that money at risk of suddenly disappearing? Is that money coming from over-levered buyers (like 2006)? Are "them foreigners" propping up home prices?

If the money flooding the market is as fragile as the subprime loans in 2006, then I'd scream "bubble". However, your comment just about sums up my thoughts on things. Seems like the real-estate in Seattle has strong legs. But hey, I'm just guessing here... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Despite the downvotes, I guess I'll help.

 Or have you been screwed with your degree and are currently unemployed, unable to pay back student loans?

I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science in 2009 and currently work as a software engineer, paid back all my student loans in 7 years. A degree related to technology generally pays off well.

 Do I even need a bachelors or could I do away with less?

One thing to consider: a software engineer isn't necessarily a computer scientist and vice versa. So, no, you don't need a computer science degree to work in software. In fact, some of the smaller colleges in the area offer degrees specifically geared towards software engineering.

That said, if you are interested in using computational theory to do some cool shit as a software engineer, I'd highly recommend getting a degree in computer science. You'll learn most of what you need to work in the industry (or at least learn how to learn it) and you'll dive into some really interesting theoretical topics as well.

 Hell, after you got your degree, do you feel a coding boot-camp would have been just as lucrative for you?

Maybe? I've interviewed candidates from bootcamps and find that they lack a deeper understanding of the type of code the write. Like, they know what MVC is, but lack the understanding of why MVC exists, where it came from, or what problem it solved.

 Lastly, do you feel confined to Seattle/west coast or do you feel you can go anywhere?

Kind of, but that could be because I love the west coast. However, I've interviewed with companies in New York and Las Vegas (is Vegas west coast?).

 Big loans scare the shit out of me.

As they should, good on you for being responsible about it. Like I said before, money spent on education related to technology/science generally pays off well in the long run. </TEXT>

The area around Mt. Baker station *looks* shady, but it has definitely changed. It feels safer than it has in the past. That said, I'd recommend the Columbia City station. It's surrounded by a relatively quiet, residential neighborhood. The Mt. Baker station is elevated above a busy intersection and commercial buildings.

As always... use common sense, keep your head on a swivel, and stay in the lighted areas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hotel 1000 has a nice view (if you get a room high enough). Very close to Pioneer Square and all the fun bars/tours down there. Also, a really nice (but small) spa to get a massage in.

The Westin is further north, but closer to all the fun stuff in Belltown and Seattle Center. Some of my favorite Tom Douglas spots are nearby: Palace Kitchen, Lola, and Dahlia Bakery.

Edgewater has an excellent view in nearly all the rooms (it's on the freakin' water). It's very close to all the fun stuff on the waterfront, including the Great Wheel. Still lots of construction down there though, I think. One fun talking point about it is the Beatles once stayed there.

<TEXT>  Why does your light rail not run all the way downtown at night?

~~It does... until 1 o'clock in the morning.~~ I assume it stops running because ridership is low at that time, just my guess though.

edit: Going into downtown stops at 12.30a (http://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Link-light-rail). I'm still guessing service stops going into downtown because ridership is low, but someone with more knowledge might be able to give a definitive answer.

 Second, why do your vending machines not accept Amexes.

Probably the same reason lots of places don't accept Amex: higher swipe fees.

 Why does it feel like the light rail is so far from the airport?

You mean the station? If you took the right path, it's literally walking distance from the main gates of the airport.

Have fun during your stay! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can confirm, from the PNW here. It's an XJ playground. USFS roads everywhere, ORV trails throughout the central/southern cascades, beach-cruising on the coast.

I did a roadtrip in my XJ from Seattle, WA to Crater Lake, OR and back up along the 101. Slept in the back, got high, and saw some amazing sites along the coast. Snapped [this little gem](http://i.imgur.com/Mcn7CNI.jpg?1) while taking a pitstop. Highly recommend making the trip! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never done it on the X220, but I upgraded the CPU on my old T61 way back in the day. I can't imagine it'd be super difficult on the X220, but it's definitely not something you want to rush to finish. If you're not comfortable taking apart your laptop down to it's motherboard, I'd get someone else to do it. However, there's lots of resources out there on taking ThinkPads apart! </TEXT>

I just bought an Intel 6300 WLAN card and BT3 module. I also bought a 6cell battery, I have a 9cell, but I don't like how it sticks out.

<TEXT> I have the 1st-gen Thinkpad 13 (roughly 4 months now) and I'll soon be looking to replace it with just about any newer T-series laptop. I upgraded from an X220, which had very decent build-quality over the years I've owned it. The Thinkpad 13, while great compared to most laptops, is not even close to the build quality of my X220. It flexes, bends, and creaks in ways the older chassis doesn't. Hopefully, the newer T-series Thinkpads don't have the same issue.

If I were you, I'd get the T470 based on the chassis material alone. If budget is a huge issue, the Thinkpad 13 will be just fine. </TEXT>

Coming from an X220, the TP13 was a huge disappointment in terms of build-quality. Hopefully the newer X and T series laptops are better... I suppose I'll find out soon. </TEXT>

One of the main reasons I chose it was because I wanted to reuse all of my NATO/leather straps that I used on my Weekender. The chronograph and date window are great bonuses and I think it looks great on my wrist! It's a bit bulkier than my Weekender, but I think it might be a bit lighter (weird). Either way, I think it's a suitable replacement.

I did a quick write-up with more photos comparing the two, let me know if you're interested and I'll share it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll add more to my comment since it's not super helpful:

OP, take the advice of /u/addtokart. Look along the lightrail.

While you might be fine with the "Dallas-esque" commute to and from Capitol Hill in a car, you have to worry about parking, traffic, etc. That commute will be more than brutal, it would be fucking soul-sucking.

The lightrail will extend as far up as Lynnwood and currently goes as far down as Angle Lake. If I were you, I'd look for a house as far down south as Des Moines. With your price range, you might be able to find a decent home that fits your needs. You'd also have the option to rail into work rather than drive.

It would really help existing Seattle-ites if you did your best NOT to drive into work every day.

Good luck! </TEXT>

Just make sure to check everything before going on those long hauls. Carry spare parts/fluids with you just to be safe.

 Once or twice, it happens. But if it becomes a frequent issue - and XJs are quite old - perhaps it's not the best vehicle for me.

I'd be lying to you if I told you my XJ hasn't broken down on me more than twice while on the road. Your experience may vary, but I've had my fair share of AAA calls...

That said, more often than not, the fixes were cheap and doable myself. Which leads to my last point...

 I really don't know much about cars but I'm willing to learn and repair myself.

I'm not proud to say, but I didn't know jack about cars until my 30s. I learned everything I know about car maintenance and repair from working on my XJ these past 2 or so years. Because of how old XJs are, things are fairly straightforward to pull apart and piece back together. It's an excellent learning vehicle, IMO.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> We got outbid at 2 different townhomes on California Ave (just south of the Junction). One went $20k above list, the other went just under $10k above list. You are right, it's brutal...

 How many attempts did you have to make? How many weeks/months did it take you to finally secure a house?

We finally got an offer accepted for a townhome down in Columbia City. While it isn't West Seattle, the commute into downtown is far better (we're walking distance from the light rail!) and the home is a brand new construction. It took 1 month of negotiating and 3 counter-offers to finally agree on a price.

 Did you do pre-inspections at each house you bid on?

On the first townhome, we didn't do a pre-inspection. However, the seller provided one for the second townhome.

 How much did you typically over-bid over the asking price?

For the ones in West Seattle, all we did was ask for closing costs. We offered to pay listing price, which was still really high IMHO.

 How did you keep your chin up while fighting in this bloodbath?

Frankly, by being flexible and exploring other areas. 4-5 years ago, I was SURE I was going to own a house on Beacon Hill. There was no "if" "ands" or "buts" about it.

However, it just wasn't working out (price wise). So, we started walking around West Seattle and Columbia City... turns out, we love these neighborhoods! And even better, we found a home within our price range!

 Any advice other than "don't even try?"

Be open and flexible on what or where you buy, but don't settle. If you really MUST be in West Seattle, be prepared to either save up more money or wait longer.

Good luck! Try to remember that buying a house is quite a privilege here in Seattle. You're in a really awesome spot! Stay positive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to hit the heavy bag frequently at my gym. 100lbs is the perfect weight for someone just looking to do some basic bag work.

One thing that lots of beginners do on the bag is plant their feet and wail on the bag until they're tired. That's great and all, but you can get an even better workout by doing some basic boxing footwork.

* Step around the bag, dance with it (this will depend on your stance: orthodox or southpaw).
* Step in, throw your combo, then step out.

Naturally, the bag will sway back and forth. Once you get in a rhythm, one way to practice stepping in, out, and side-to-side is to follow the sway of the bag. If it sways away from you, step in and hit. As it sways towards you, step out and move to the side.

Good luck!

edit: Here's a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkEgqzn2os) of what I was trying to explain. Watch as he steps forward to throw his combo as the bag moves away, then steps back out as it moves towards him. Add this basic movement into your bag routine and it'll be way more difficult than planting and throwing. </TEXT>

They're not exactly "close to downtown" (that's relative anyway), but they have public transit options to get there. In terms of walkability for things like grocery shopping, laundromats, etc., each have varying degrees, but you could certainly get it all done.

These neighborhoods have a good mix of luxury/older apartment buildings.

If you happen to find this wonderful, imaginary neighborhood, please be sure to report back so we can "gentrify" it. </TEXT>

The only reason I went with 30s was because I started out with a 2" budget boost and the 31s would have rubbed. When I moved up to 3.5", I just kept the 30s.

If I fall into money, I'll probably go up to 31s myself.

I'm running 16.04 on my 13 and notice no jumpiness at all.

<TEXT> 1. I don't know, but I bought mine two weeks ago despite all these potential "holiday" sales. You could probably wait until then to get the best deal. I just got impatient.

2. I think the clockspeed of the i3 would be fine, but I think you'd want higher cache of the i5 to take advantage of memory-intensive programs. On that note, I'd consider maxing out the memory, as I imagine he'll want to do Excel, Word, and web browsing all at the same time.

3. Display is meh and I do have some light leakage at the bottom of the screen. I have the 1080 version. Screen space is most important for me, but it may not be for your dad.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The configuration on Lenovo's website offer a max of 16GB, but the hardware supports up to 32GB. In my research ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/4lft2p/would_a_thinkpad_13_support_32gb_or_ram/) and [Crucial](http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/Lenovo/thinkpad-13)), I've found that you can, in fact, install 32GB of memory in the 13 (Intel version).

I mean for the bit of development I do, the [i5-6300U](http://ark.intel.com/products/88190/Intel-Core-i5-6300U-Processor-3M-Cache-up-to-3_00-GHz) is more than enough. I run a VM or two for my dev environments with Vagrant, so memory is usually what my laptop is hungry for (and yes, I know 32GB is still overkill haha). The 6300U supports Intel's virtualization tech, so I guess that helps too.

Can you define "kind of suck" a bit more? I'm just curious as to why you'd prefer the previous generation i5. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to work down on Dayton Ave back in 2010. It's definitely got an older crowd, lots of retirees. However, if you're looking to settle down, I think Edmonds is a great place to live.

 Feels up and coming, like it might be a good future investment?

I haven't heard anything about Edmonds being "up and coming" in any way. Not amongst my peers anyway. Nobody is "flocking" to Edmonds... Property, in general, is a good investment though!

It's not the city, so it'll be slow and boring. Yes, there are busses and trains, but getting into downtown via public transit will be no less shittier than it already is to commute from any suburb. In fact, commuting from downtown Edmonds to downtown would probably be worse than other suburbs because it's proximity to I5.

Costco is just a quick hop south on 99. The Harbor Square Athletic Club is still one of the best gyms I've ever been to in the entire region (though it's relatively expensive). Great crabbing and squidding from the Edmonds fishing pier!

My wife and I are also in the hunt for a house to buy, good luck with the house hunt! </TEXT>

However, one of my favorite places to visit was [Giardino delle Rose](https://www.visitflorence.com/what-to-see-in-florence/gardens-in-florence.html), up in the hills of the Oltrarno district. The view was pretty spectacular and I remember it better than the view from Piazzale Michelangelo.

Don't get me wrong, the panoramic view of the city is awesome from up there, but I quite enjoyed this view as well! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got a 3.5" RE lift and ran with stock brake-lines for awhile. However, I extended them because I was afraid they'd rip out during flex. It also makes it easier to drop the axles (for any other work you need to do).

I also drove for awhile without an SYE. The vibes were annoying, so I did a T-case drop in the meantime. A T-case drop is not a permanent solution, but it'll hold over until I have time/money for an SYE.

Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived in the suburbs for a good portion of my life. One major difference I've noticed between my suburban friends and city friends is a huge aversion to walking.

Assuming you are able to (which may not be the case), simply walking to the grocery store would save you the $2.50. Lower Queen Anne is a very walkable area, so it shouldn't be too terrible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I just stayed at the Hotel 1000 for a "stay-cation" and I'd say it fits your description. It's sleek and modern, has a spa, gym, etc. We were able to walk everywhere (Westlake, Pioneer Square, Waterfront). It's close to the Pioneer Square light rail station, so you can take a quick ride up to explore Capitol Hill (we live on Capitol Hill and we took the rail down to get to the hotel).

We did some quick research on the Fairmont Hotel, Inn at the Market, and Alexis Hotel. You'd be fine with the others, but Hotel 1000 was our choice.

PM me if you have any other questions. Goodluck! </TEXT>

Unless you've got someone who will work on your XJ if/when it breaks down or needs maintenance (or you've got enough cash to pay someone to do it), I'd stay clear of one. While you might get lucky on one that needs little-to-no maintenance, chances are you're gonna have to put in some wrench work.

As per advice from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/567zkb/comcasts_1tb_data_caps_start_to_roll_out/), I recommend contacting the FCC and filing a complaint.

<TEXT>  Carroll says defense was frustrated with last two drives. Reiterates Seahawks were in pass-defense mode while 49ers ran it.

Man, I was getting so frustrated watching the end of that game. You could totally see the frustration on the defenses' faces after those 49er TDs.

I suppose, overall, it was a decent strategy to focus on stopping the deep pass and just let them run the clock down.. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So, if you look back on all of your career, what, for you, was like the highlight?

 Being able to retire. And then being able to do this with you after retiring.

The most interesting thing I learned about Marshawn was how he viewed himself as more than an NFL player. That he doesn't view himself as "Marshawn: The Beast", but a person. He's someone who is grateful to be alive and healthy, who is seeking happiness, who is trying to live a fulfilling life... just like the rest of us out here.

Blegh, this shit is too deep for me right now... GO SEAHAWKS!

<TEXT> I stopped in [Lucerne for a night](http://urban-trailseeker.blogspot.com/2016/06/lucerne-night-along-lake.html) on the way up from Lauterbrunnen to Frankfurt late in May. It didn't seem to touristy to me. I mean, there were tourists, but not the huge crowds herding along like in Rome, for example.

I really loved this little town, even if I was only there for a night. It was very scenic! A little bit of everything: a lake, a river right through the city, the alps surrounding it, etc.

What else did you do? See? Eat? I'm just curious to see what your experience was like compared to mine.

Thanks for sharing! </TEXT>

I enjoyed the factoids for the descriptions in 2-5, it was fun to learn a little bit about each one!

For Seattle, I felt commentary was a bit lacking. What small shops? What craft breweries? What diverse neighborhoods? And what about them is particularly unique enough that I'd want to visit Seattle?

Good work and really gorgeous photos! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to Oahu for my bachelor party. It has a more "big city" feel to it. One of my best memories, besides the beaches and resorts, was doing an [ATV tour at Kualoa Ranch](http://www.kualoa.com/oahu-tours/atv-tours/).

For my honeymoon, we went to Maui. It felt more relaxed, slow, and more like a getaway than my visit to Oahu. We did lots of beach time just laying around. We also did zip-lining at [Kapalua Ziplines](http://www.kapaluaziplines.com/) and a luau (I forgot which one). We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, which I highly recommend!

Most recently, I went to wedding on the Big Island. We spent most of our time Kona side, but the wedding was on the Hilo side. Hilo was wet and rainy, but the Kona side had all the nice beaches. My favorite beach was [Manini'owali Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60872-d622557-Reviews-Manini_owali_Beach_Kua_Bay-Kailua_Kona_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html), which takes a bit of a drive through lava rocks to get to, but it's gorgeous! We also did a coffee farm tour at [Hula Daddy](http://www.huladaddy.com/) and a macadamia nut self-guided tour at the [Hamakua factory](http://www.hawnnut.com/).

Good luck, have fun, safe travels! </TEXT>

* Eat rijsttafel
* Eat stroopwafel
* Heineken is great on tap, but try to check out Brouwerij 't IJ
* Don't take photos of prostitutes (duh)
* Book entry to Anne Frank House ahead of time, if you plan on going

I really enjoyed Amsterdam! Have fun!

<TEXT> I know a ton of casual lifters who don't give a shit about bulking/cutting, linear progression, carb cycling, etc. They get along just fine. I also know a ton of goal-driven lifters who want to optimize their time, effort, and energy in the gym to get where they want to.

Personally, I go through phases. Some months out of the year, I track macros religiously and stick to a lifting program (SL5x5 most recently). Currently, I eat whatever I want and lift PPL, just because I don't have goals in mind at the moment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is just me, but I personally have had most success during my bulks when I eat some combination of:

Carb:

* rice
* black beans
* potatoes

Protein:

* chicken thighs (breast are fine too, but I get sick of it really easy)
* top sirloin steak
* ground turkey
* eggs (white AND yolk)
* tuna in a can

Vegetables: any vegetable, and as much as you can possibly stomach.

I know it isn't anything special, but I hope it's what you're looking for. You can buy most of it (especially beans and rice) in bulk. Soak the beans in water overnight to make cooking them faster the next day.

Costco is your friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently took a month off to go backpack Europe. I came back and simply resumed my SL5x5 routine, just with lighter weight (15-20% less, just to be safe).

However, maybe you can take this as an opportunity to start fresh with a new program? There's tons of different programs out there, maybe pick a new one and see how it goes.

Just a thought, good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you plan on running anything more than 5k, I recommend getting a pair of dedicated running shoes. For lifting, anything with a relatively flat sole would be good, Nike Metcons or Reebok CrossFit shoe perhaps. 

Obviously, dedicated shoes for each activity is going to give you best comfort. However, a pair of minimalist shoes might work just fine for light jogging and lifting.

For 3 years, I ran and lifted in [Merrell Trail Gloves](http://www.merrell.com/US/en/trail-glove-3/17571M.html). When these went to shit, I purchased a pair of [Inov-8 F-Lite 195s](http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-FLite-195-Black-Lime-Azure.html).

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This building dwarves our building in a monumental way, one resident said. These are condominiums that are owned; these are not apartments. Were a 3-story building, you could (call) it four because of the height of the loft ceilings, to be fair, but its not six. Well have no light. Between the micropod building behind and this building, we will literally be walled in; well have no sky view whatsoever for 19th Avenue Lofts and an east-facing unit like me.

Call me insensitive, but I don't feel bad for this resident. Especially if the new project might bring **180 market rate residential units** to Capitol Hill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I visited Florence last month and shared some [details of my visit on my blog](http://urban-trailseeker.blogspot.com/2016/05/florence-living-out-italian-renaissance.html). It was my favorite city in Italy!

Some of the things we did:

* Il Duomo di Firenze - the belltower was also very cool and has a view of the Duomo itself.
* Ponte Vecchio - cool bridge with jewelry shops, good stop on the way to Piazzale Michelangelo.
* Piazzale Michelangelo
* Eat a sandwich at All'Antico Vinaio - Do. Not. Miss. This!
* Eat Bistecca alla Fiorentina (Florentine T-Bone Steak) - make reservations early on, this is very popular!

Have fun, and please share your experience! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way I see it, establishing the run is like establishing a nice jab in a boxing match, you always try and do it first. It sets up other combinations: jab-hook, jab-straight, jab-over-hook, etc. In previous years, our jab could also be our knockout punch because of how powerful our jab was. Moving forward, looks like our haymaker will be our passing attack.

Either way, you still want to establish a good jab. I think that's what people mean by being "run first". It isn't the perfect analogy, but hopefully you see my point. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We're both history buffs, and are interested in ruins, art, museums, etc.

Rome. It's crowded and crazy at times, but absolutely wonderful for people interested in ruins, art, and museums.

 like to walk/hike

Despite how touristy Cinque Terre can get, I'd still recommend visiting. It's breathtaking! Stay the night there and get up early enough to hike around before the day-trippers get in.

I recently visited Italy and shared photos/recaps on my blog, you might find some of these useful or interesting:

I'd also make a stop in [Cinque Terre](http://urban-trailseeker.blogspot.com/2016/05/cinque-terre-dream-come-true.html) and hike around.

You had mentioned you'd been to Paris already, but I'd recommend staying or spending time in Montmartre. It's up some hills, but a nice, "out of the way" experience.

I really enjoyed the London Eye while in London. Also, drinking at various pubs around the Hackney neighborhood. Old George and Sebright Arms come to mind.

Those are some things that come to mind, PM me if you'd like more detail on anything. Have fun!

If you are going along 101, there's a lot of nice viewpoints from the parks along the Oregon coast. I can't remember a lot of them off the top of my head, but a quick Google search would bring up the major ones.

I'd recommend driving down 101 and back up I5, as it's easier to turn right than left against oncoming traffic to visit sights. Just a tiny bit of advice.

Good luck and have fun, it's a great road trip! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just in Venice last week. 4 days is quite a bit, especially for a place like Venice. There are some nice trattorias and osterias that are open "late", but most of the place shuts down as the day-tourists leave.

If you decide to hang out there, I'd recommend hitting up cicchetti in the area just north of Rialto. I hit 4 of them and enjoyed Valpolicella at each:

- Osteria Do Mori: old school vibe, closes kind of early
- Cantina Do Spade: can get busy, draws a younger crowd, lots of good food options
- All'Arco: standing room only, not very good wine or food options, but the servers were jovial
- L'Aquasanta: more of a restaurant, but had a good amount of space and good food

The whole town is "touristy", so be ready for that. My favorite part was walking around the narrow streets and simply getting lost.

Good luck and have fun! </TEXT>

Compared to these cities (which are huge and much older than Seattle), the mass transit in Seattle is so-so. With the exception of Florence and Venice, all these other cities have vast networks of underground subways (metro, tube, etc.), upper ground trollies or trains (trams, streetcar, etc.), and intra-city railways, in addition to busses. Yes, we have light rail, street car, etc., but they aren't as vast. We're getting there though... </TEXT>

First and foremost, *fix your diet*. You will see a huge difference by doing that first! I'd also pass on the supplements for now, trust me they won't help you at this stage.

Start by [calculating your TDEE](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/calculators/tdee-calculator.html). Then, keep calorie consumption under that number. Track your food using [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/).

Drink coffee: do a Google Map search of "coffee" on Capitol Hill and pick one, most are good. Yes, I know there are coffee places outside of Capitol Hill, but some of my favorites are here. Also, checkout Vivace South Lake Union and Seattle Coffee Works downtown.

Eat pho: apparently, Pho can be hard to find outside of Seattle, hit up a Pho spot. There are plenty.

Drink beer: breweries are everywhere. My favorites are Fremont Brewing, Georgetown Brewing, and Hales Brewing.

Play this game: only go to a place (restaurant, convenience store, bar, etc.) that you CAN'T go to in Eugene. Have a 7-11 in Eugene? Can't go there. Have a Starbucks in Eugene? Can't go there.

You could change into your clothes before heading to the gym. Or change quicker, I can't imagine it taking too long to get geared up for a workout. Or... grow up a bit? Wangs are normal.

 I like my privacy a little too much.

You could start building a home gym. It'd be expensive, but you'd be able to work out in the comfort of your garage. If you aren't doing anything with weights, you could try a living room program like P90X/Insanity.

 a simple, easy to follow workout plan for me to follow.

I'd also recommend looking at a beginner strength program. The one I see touted all the time is [Stronglifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/5x5/#Summary_of_Stronglifts_52155). It focuses on the basic compound movements.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started) pretty much answers all your questions. My advice is to keep it simple. Start be eating clean at maintenance TDEE. If you're looking to gain strength, give [SL5x5](http://stronglifts.com/) a look. It's always recommended for beginners here. If you want to get into running, check out [Couch to 5k](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml).

<TEXT>  how has fitness helped you maintain/improve your mental health?

When I go for a run, it feels like I'm meditating. I'll breath in and think about anything that stressed me out that day, then breath it out. It's very therapeutic.

When I hit the weights, it's a great outlet for anger or aggression, for obvious reasons. Also very therapeutic.

 What are some fun, cheap ways to get into fitness?

Does your university have a rec center or gym? You could check it out. You could also just get outside and walk/hike/jog around campus.

If you've never worked out before, there's a ton of great information on getting started in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started). If you are just looking for a routine, the wiki has a [section with workout plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_adding_exercise). Just pick one and stick to it.

Good luck! </TEXT>

Wash

 If you wash them how many times do you wear it between washes?

Approx 3-4 wears

 Do you wash with your other clothes or separately?

Seperate

 Do you do regular wash and then air dry?

Delicate then air dry

<TEXT> Yea I get it. Finding a good gym is important to me, not so much to others. If I find a good gym, I'm a loyal member for at least 2-3 years. That said, I've only been a long-time member of a couple of gyms, so I can only speak on the pros/cons of each of those:

**24 Hour Fitness Yale**

Pros:

* entire floor dedicated to cardio
* dedicated weightlifting floor with 2 squat racks (1 power rack)
* olympic style weights in a corner

Cons:

* super crowded at peak times
* not as posh as the Northgate one (this can be a pro as well, as the weightlifting area is all business, no frills)

**Rival Fitness on Capitol Hill**

Pros:

* indoor turf area (nice for athletic training)
* 4 (YES FOUR) squat racks, all of which are power cages
* olympic style weights

Cons:

* very little variety of cardio (treadmills, step mill, and bikes)
* little to no weightlifting machines (shit like Smith machines)
* small as hell

**24 Hr Fitness in Northgate**

Pros:

* large cardio area with lots of different machines (and TVs)
* decent free weight area, 2 squat racks (1 power rack)

Cons:

* super crowded at peak times
* no olympic weights (though I see people deadlift with standard plates anyway...)

**Harbor Square in Edmonds**

Pros:

* olympic style weights
* big facility, plenty of parking
* pretty much everything (pool, tennis court, basketball court, racquetball, etc.)

Cons:

* lots of old people (not much of a con, but worth mentioning)
* far away, Edmonds

All opinion, and these are only things that come off the top of my head. If you have any questions about each one, feel free to PM me. Good luck, stay healthy.

*edit: I tried to format it so it's readable but gave up half way, fuck it. PM me if you have questions.* </TEXT>

If it's accomplishing these things, then I'm guessing it's enough. Seems to be making a positive difference in your life. That's healthy.

If you eventually want to run a triathlon, then you might want to take it to the next level and actually start a running program. A quick Google search brought me [here](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/cms/category.asp?catid=28 authorid=0 page=1 spp=15).

Good luck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a pair of minimalist shoes for lifting and running shorter distances (~5k). For anything longer than 5k, I have a dedicated pair of running shoes. If you really only want one shoe for both, I'd recommend a minimalist shoe like Inov8 FLite 195. That's the shoe I use, it has a 3mm drop, which is flat enough for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the issues I've had while running on the beach is being extra careful with my ankles. When I run on concrete, it's kind of mindless, just hit the pavement. However, with sand (or trail) running, I have to be more cognizant of where I'm stepping.

An advantage would be working muscles you otherwise wouldn't be working while hitting pavement. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Subpar performance (10-12 FPS) on i5-4440 and GTX 970? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-24 12:03:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know there have been some threads on the Steam forum regarding performance issues with Nvidia cards in the past, but I was looking to see if there are any recent updates on the issue I'm having. I'm averaging very low FPS (8-12) in a city of a population ~50k on highest settings.

I don't think my system is being pushed to the max:

* Intel i5-4440 (3.1Ghz)
* GTX 970
* 8GB Ripjaws

* Windows 10 Home 10.0.10586 B 10586
* Nvidia Driver 10.18.13.6143

Here's a screenshot of my monitors, GPU-Z and Resource Monitor: http://i.imgur.com/fX6otEH.png 

I've tried the following with little to no improvement (~3 FPS gain?):

* forced DX9 through 'Launch Options'
* rolled back my Nvidia driver to previous release
* unparked my CPUs
* ran in compatibility mode for Windows 8, then 7
* re-installing the game

No assets, mods, etc. Pure vanilla game.

Any ideas on why this might be happening? Any help at all would be appreciated, thanks!
 
**UPDATE (1/25/2016):** A fresh install of Windows 10 did the trick. If you upgraded from 8.1 or 7, wipe the HD and re-install if you're having performance issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bro answer: clothes don't make you lift any heavier, wear whatever the hell you want. 

MFA answer: I really like Nike's running dri-fit tops. I also have some of Target's workout brand tops as well (C9?) if you're looking for cheaper options. I wear mostly Nike shorts, but I'll also wear any old pair. For shoes, I have a dedicated pair of Asics for running and a pair of [Inov8 F-Lite 195s](http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-FLite-195-Black-Lime-Azure.html) for light jogs and weightlifting.

I hear a lot of good things about Lululemon tops, thought they are quite pricey.

<TEXT> Cautious optimism, the Seahawk fan's motto... I agree, but I think, if anything, it shows that he has the ability and confidence to make those types of throws. Yes, it was against arguably bad secondaries, but it still takes a good QB to execute those kinds of plays.

It also helps that the run game is something opposing defenses will have to respect moving forward, even without Lynch. Thank you, Rawls! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Greetings, fellow Seattle redditors! I'm looking for restaurants in Seattle that offer unique dishes or experiences. 

As an example, [Radiator Whiskey](http://www.radiatorwhiskey.com/food.html) offers a **roasted pig head**, which isn't something you can just find and order at any other restaurant. Another example would be [Art of Table](http://artofthetable.net/category/menu/), where you just sit and **let the chefs serve you whatever the menu is for that day**, without you really ordering.

I was wondering if you knew of any other places that offer unique foods or experiences like this. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

 A home isn't an investment. It's a housing choice and a lifestyle choice in which you can build equity. Too many people excuse irresponsible home purchasing decisions by simplistically viewing it as "an investment" which it, by definition, is not.

That said, I'd say purchasing a home in Seattle wouldn't be a bad decision right now. It's a great place to live and, IMO, will continue to become a better place to live moving forward. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I always joke with some of the players every now and then that everyone has Madden nowadays, he said. Everybody gets to play, and they're offensive coordinators on their game. Everybody's picking plays, it's been that for years and years. People are the armchair quarterbacks, are going to be able to poke holes in whatever you're doing...

Anytime my friends say that they could do a better job than Bevell at calling plays, I always tell them, "This shit ain't Madden." It takes years of experience and hours of study to come up with an offensive gameplan.

I'm not a Bevell apologist or anything, but I certainly think there very few people who can do his job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's your fitness level? If you are just getting into fitness, read the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started) first. If you're already in shape, I'd recommend sprints, hill-drills, ladder drills, and cone drills. You might want to get with people who know how to do the drills, just to coach you up a little bit.

Check out [this list of cone drills](http://www.kingsportstraining.com/blogs/training-blog/8269753-10-best-speed-and-agility-cone-drills).

Also, [this list of ladder drills](http://www.kingsportstraining.com/blogs/training-blog/7694405-13-speed-and-agility-ladder-drills-videos-for-faster-footwork) (by the same folks).

I did try out some barefoot shoes and found that they helped me adjust from heel-striking to mid-to-toe-striking, which improved some knee pain I was feeling during longer runs.

Anything other than running, I throw on my trainers. I'm actually in the market for some new ones! Currently looking into Inov8. </TEXT>

We basically wrote down everything we considered shared (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.) and split it according to the percentage of our monthly income. I make more, so I pay for more, it's just the way we decided to do it.

So far, it's worked wonderfully. Everything absolutely essential is paid for, and I still have some money left over for my own personal hobbies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wailing on the bag is a great workout, but you might as well learn proper technique while you're at it. That said, shadow box first. Look in the mirror, record yourself, have someone watch, etc. 

I'm no pro boxer, but here's my routine (assuming I'm all warmed up) by round:

1. Jab only
2. Jab-cross (1-2)
3. Jab-cross-hook (1-2-3)
4. Any combo above, as fast as possible
5. Every punch is a knockout punch, as hard as possible, good form

The first three rounds, I'm usually focusing on timing and form. The last two rounds, I focus on fight situations (move my head, step in and out). All five rounds, I'm "dancing" with the bag. Feet are constantly moving with a continuous "orbit" around the bag.

I like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMQZLqA0zBQ) too.

Have fun! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bought a 1998 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) 3 years ago for $4k. I do all the maintenance and work on it myself. It gets me from point A to point B, as long as the distance isn't road-trip length. My wife has a 2006(?) Mazda 3, which we use for longer drives.

I highly recommend getting a "beater" car, especially if you have a newer, reliable vehicle in the household. That said, you, personally, might lose some peace of mind on your daily commute ("will this break today?"). A beater car requires more energy, time, and patience. You have to really take care to find **and** maintain it.

Side note: I also used the opportunity to learn about cars in general. Which is valuable information if you have the time and energy to learn. So, that's a plus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 30 now, but after I graduated I put all my excess income into an OptionsHouse brokerage account. Low-commision, 100 free trade, etc. Bought some stocks in companies I knew well, with respected leadership, and high growth potential (your method of stock-picking will vary). Cashed it out 5 years later (taxed and all) to pay off the rest of my student loans last year. I didn't feel right having my money in stocks while I had debt lingering, even though I was technically "up" in my brokerage, beating the interest on the loan.

Don't really know if that counts as advice, just my experience.

tl;dr - graduated college w/ debt, took excess income (after retirement, emergency, etc.) and opened brokerage, picked stocks, sold off gains to kill off student loan </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife suffered from the same, paralyzing beginning. She read all the diet books, knew all the strength+conditioning programs, watched all the Youtube clips, followed the right blogs, etc., but it was like trying to drink from the firehose. Her main goal is look athletic and lose fat.

Our approach? Keep it as simple as humanly possible. 

Calculated her daily [caloric limit](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/calculators/tdee-calculator.html) and made sure she stayed under. Forget about macros, forget about "low-carb", forget about fasted workouts, blah blah blah... just *stay under your damn number*, simple as that (for now).

Next, we added an *activity* rather than following some kind of 5x5 PPL Strong Fit Cross program. Yes, I know many programs [listed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_adding_exercise) are quite simple, but if you're not having any fun (or feel like they are too complicated), then *do something you can understand and enjoy doing*. Even if it's basic as hell, like hiking once a week. Consistency is key.

That's all I can offer. I'm no professional or anything, just sharing our experience. Goodluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with the author that "fat model, skinny controller" is sometimes misinterpreted as "fat ActiveRecord, skinny controller". The word "model" in this context really refers to the entire business-logic layer of an application, which happens to include DB interaction. Sometimes people forget ROR is still Ruby, and disregard SOLID OOP. Keeping objects *within* the model layer small and cohesive is very important, like the author proposes in the example (UserRecord vs User).

Thanks for the share, cheers! </TEXT>

Fix your diet first. Keep it simple: calculate your [TDEE](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/calculators/tdee-calculator.html), then eat below that number.

Once you have diet figured out, add exercise. I'd simplify it even more and just add activities. Hike, jog, go for walks. Ready for something more concrete? I always see [SL5x5](http://stronglifts.com/5x5/) recommended. </TEXT>

<TEXT> RHA M750s. Just got these 2 weeks ago. Crystal-clear midrange (piano and vocals sound fucking gorgeous) without overwhelming, muddy bass. Very good isolation too. I work in an open office, blast my music, and people around me can hardly hear me.

If you're a bass-head, though, these might not fulfill your needs. I sometimes long for earth-shattering bass, and these don't give them to me.

<TEXT> I just got the M750s as my first set of "good" IEMs, but here's my humble, rookie opinion on them:

They don't provide the bass you might like in some of the harder EDM songs. I occasionally flip between music like Knife Party (electro-house) and music like DJ Okawari (jazz-hiphop). I don't feel like there is enough "head-banging" bass for the electro-house stuff. However, anything with a piano or vocalist sounds abso-*fucking*-lutely beautiful. Crystal clear, every single instrument can be heard.

Like I said, I'm a rookie, but just my $.02. </TEXT>

After searching through some old threads in the sub, I saw that some posters recommended "breaking in" new headphones for a couple of weeks to get your ears used to them, then slip on the old ones to see if you can actually tell a difference.

Does anyone have any type of ritual before they find out whether or not they like their new headphones? A timeline? A set of tracks? Genuinely curious to learn what everybody does to figure out whether they like new headphones or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Budget** - Less than $150

**Source** - Motorola Moto X, 2015 MBP, Lenovo Thinkpad x220

**Requirements for Isolation** - Isolation is important. Mostly used on bus, open-layout office, and coffee shop.

**Preferred Type of Headphone** - IEM, but open to closed-back, over-ear.

**Preferred tonal balance** - Balance is important, but if I had to lean one way, I prefer more bass than less.

**Past headphones** - Most "premium" headphones I've ever owned were Bose.

* [AmazonBasics In-Ear Headphones with Microphone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L3KSP08)
* [Bose SoundTrue Headphones On-Ear Style, Black](http://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundTrue-Headphones-Style-Black/dp/B00IUICOF8)

**Preferred Music** - Mostly ambient, electronic, and hip-hop instrumentals.

* [musicforprogramming.net](http://musicforprogramming.net/?c=thirtytwo)
* [C418 (Minecraft Music)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3_InDEtpLA)
* [Gramatik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrVuGiKRVDU)

I'm a software engineer, so I like to go heads down on my computer while having music in my ears. I know a lot of my colleagues prefer huge cans to give the "fuck off" signal to others, but that isn't as important to me. I also commute on the bus daily and fly every other month or so. I would like to tune those noises out.

While my budget is $150, I'd like to get the best bang for buck. So, the less expensive, the better. However, I'm not afraid to shell out more for "better" (depending on what you all say)!

**Considering** -

<TITLE> Putco Harness - Headlights Won't Shut Off </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-12 08:03:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I finally got around to installing my [Putco harness](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P29X4G) to give the headlights a boost. However, I'm running into a strange issue. The headlights simply won't turn off.

I know that the fog wiring on [97+ XJs can cause highbeam issues](http://www.cherokeeforum.com/f67/putco-headlight-wire-harness-install-fail-147992/#post2005100), but I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this harness and this particular issue.

Thanks in advanced! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I feel your pain. Been debating this modification myself lately. I'll probably end up doing it myself, and taking an entire week to do it because it's literally the first and only car I've every done any type of work on (aside from oil changes).

But hell, it's why I bought the rig. I wanted to learn how to work on cars. My dad kept our 1991 Ford Ranger running to this day, and I always told myself I'd learn how to do the same.

 I'll just have to pull up my sleeves and get it done

That's the XJ way, man. It fucking sucks sometimes, but you gotta break some bolts and fingers to keep her running smooth. Keep us posted and good luck! </TEXT>

<TITLE> 98 XJ Sport - Extended rear driveshaft? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm getting some gnarly driveline vibrations on the freeway and I'm trying to alleviate the situation without breaking my wallet. I know I can do a t-case drop (which I already have purchased), but I found an ad on craigslist for a guy selling an extended driveshaft. I believe it's a non-SYE shaft that's 1" longer than my stock one.

Would this work to help those vibrations? Anyone have experience simply extending the driveshaft vs installing an SYE or t-case drop?

<TEXT> To me, going to the gym is a given. I wake up, go to work, go to the gym, and go home to my wife. It's like a job, you can't just skip a day of work to hang out. Over the past couple of months, friends would often invite me out for a bite or drink at the bar. Most of the time, I respectfully say, "I can't make it, I have to go to the gym."

All of a sudden, I'm the prick who doesn't want to hang out with them. I'm the guy who can't seem to "miss one day at the gym to catch up with friends." Then, when I do find time to hang out with them, and I decline an offer for a drink or fry (watching macros), someone exclaims, "Boooooo, party foul! What's the point of coming out?!?!" Fine, I get it. It's common for a couple of friends to be gainz killers. This isn't new.

However, I got to go on vacation with my friends not too long ago. I'm in the best fucking shape in my life. Like, I am excited to take my shirt off at the pool and show off the work. And when I do, all I hear is, "Man, I sure wish I had your metabolism and genetics..."

I nearly lost my shit. It wasn't my metabolism and genetics! It's the hard work I put in while y'all were drinking beer and eating tater tots every god damn Friday at the bar! Fucking, damn it I need new friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Greetings, PF. A close group of friends of mine want to start regularly saving money for a huge trip we plan to take in the next 2 years. Someone suggested starting a joint savings account we could contribute to, earn a bit of interest on, and cash out later. While it sounds simple, I'm wondering if there are "gotchas" we could be missing in this approach.

Has anyone ever tried something like this with friends?

<TEXT>  But the story is in the conversation. The story is in the subtleties and interactions between the characters. It's in the way they look at each other and how they say certain things and what's happening in the background. It's not an in-your-face action movie by any means.

Which is why the Godfather II is actually my favorite movie of all time. It's the fall of the Corleone family (which really begins in the first movie) intertwined with its rise. No other movie has gotten me to fall in love with the characters the way the Godfather I and II have. </TEXT>

It seems like fitness is your primary goal. Crossfit will help you achieve your goals faster than MMA.

You'll get many different opinions on this, but my view is that you join an MMA gym to learn how to fight, fitness is just the side-effect.

"You should incorporate more [hippy food] instead of [normal food] into your diet."

I'm sorry that I enjoy the taste of rice over quinoa while saving money in the process. It fits my macros, I'm eating it.

"Back squats are bad for you. You should stop doing them."

No, back squats are bad FOR YOU. Just because you have terrible form does not mean I have terrible form.

"A slice of cheesecake won't hurt your progress that much! Come on, you're being a douche!"

To quote Jay Z, "what I eat don't make you shit." I don't want cheesecake, for christ's sake. Just because your fat ass doesn't have any self control doesn't mean I have to give in to temptation.

<TEXT>  I do want to point out, however, that treating such an account as play money - you have Stock Picks written in your list, not Sound Investment Strategy - is counter productive to growing your wealth. This is your money and its purpose is to make you more money.

Sorry, yes I understand this. I bought some stocks about 5 years ago. Since then, I've reallocated to mostly index ETFs and large-cap dividend payers. I stopped the trading casino years ago! I'm a bit more passive with this account than I was when I first started!

 Just realize that if you do this before getting out of debt, everything you spend money on will cost more by the amount of the interest rate on your debt. You would be paying a premium to do this while in debt.

A fair assessment, and something I didn't factor into the cost of the trip. I'll have to do additional calculations and possibly scale things back if it's too detrimental to our finances in the near future.

Glad to see someone else who has taken extended time off to travel. We've fought, debated, and struggled this topic so much (which is kind of a first-world problem if you look at it...). Basically, we can save money now, have a stable retirement, THEN travel the world at 65. However, I want to be able to hike, bike, walk, and climb around the world at the limber age of 30. At this point, we're sacrificing a (potentially significant) amount of money in our future to do so.

Blegh, I've rambled on, but thank you so much for your input. Means a lot.

<TEXT>  Depends on the rate. Her interest is tax deductible, which essentially works out (within applicable limits) to a discount on the interest rate equal to your marginal tax bracket (e.g., if your interest rate is 8% and your marginal tax rate is 25%, you're "really" paying only 6% interest). If the interest rate on the loans is less than what you expect to gain on your IRA, the IRA is a better choice.

Thanks for that breakdown! I forgot to take into account the tax-deductible interest. With that, it might actually make more sense to contribute to my IRA at that point.

 "I" (since I was the breadwinner at the time) paid off my wife's student loans. But it wasn't really "me" doing the paying anyway, since the money was hers as much as mine.

Absolutely, this is how I view it as well. This helps to justify our mindsets.

 What I like to do is to figure how much interest I could save by using the money to pay for debt instead, and tacking that onto the cost of the trip.

I will definitely do this when I get home to the budget! This will put things a bit more into perspective, especially calculating *true* losses because of the trip. Hopefully, it's still worth it, but I've already stressed to her that I'm not going to "go broke" for this trip.

 Do you have new jobs lined up afterward? I would not be comfortable with both myself and my spouse quitting at the same time -- for whatever reason -- without a clear plan for what we do next.

I'll be completely honest, she will probably lose her job and I will be able to take a 3-month sabbatical. However, I want to be prepared for the both of us being unemployed. Fortunately, I'm in an industry where it isn't super hard to find work for decent pay. I can't say the same for her, but hopefully our emergency fund will cover her income. We also have the added fortune of staying with family rent-free when we return, which has already been established, though I'd like to avoid it!

Thanks so much for your reply!

<TEXT> You don't have to remove the brake hose from the caliper to swap the pads, but I'll share this anyway:

Last time I worked with the front brakes, I snapped the banjo bolt (connects the brake hose to the caliper). Don't overtighten this bolt, it will snap! If it leaks after re-attaching, there is a copper washer that is supposed to go between the brake hose connector and the caliper. Sometimes, it doesn't sit right. Check that instead of trying to tighten the bolt too much.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll try and keep this short and sweet. I feel like my wife and I are doing pretty well with our finances so far. We have the following:

* Emergency Fund 3mo
* No Consumer Debt
* Contributions to Retirement (Her 401k, My IRA)
* Student Loan Debt (Her $34k)
* A Brokerage Account (Stock Picks, etc.)
* Savings Obligations for a Big Trip

A couple of questions:

I do not have a 401k at my company, so I'm thinking I should max out my IRA, right? Even so, that's only $5500 /yr for the next 35 years (if I retire at 65). By my own calculations, I'll have relatively little to live on in retirement! Is this right? Should I be finding other ways to save for retirement outside of my IRA?

I just completed paying off *my* student loans by selling of stocks in my brokerage account. According to the FAQ, we should be tackling her student loan debt before allocating funds for retirement. Rather than contributing to my IRA, should I be contributing to *her* loan payment? I don't know how many married couples handle paying off each other's debt, but I imagine it's a team effort. Any other advice on this?

This "Big Trip" we have planned is a 3-month excursion from Asia to Europe. I know, we should probably be paying down our debt before saving and spending money on this trip, but we've already decided (after much debate) that this is really the only time we'll be able to do this... Not only does this put us out of income for 3-months, but we will most-likely be leaving our jobs. My question is, has anyone ever done something like this and came out alright? Is a trip like this utterly and completely out of line for our financial situation?

Any insight, experiences, and advice on anything I mentioned would be MUCH appreciated. Thanks so much in advance! </TEXT>

I had the temperature pretty high consistently throughout the process. I kept it roasting well past the first crack. However, I did end up turning down the temperature as things started getting really burnt, but it may have been preemptive...

I also only let it rest over night, which doesn't seem to be long enough. Maybe I'll let it rest a bit longer.

The latest prices don't reflect the actual price I paid, since I ordered everything on Black Friday / Cyber Monday. It was just **under $900** !


**My Story**

So, I grew up building computers. My father got into IT in the early 90s and he built computers for our household from spare parts from work and trips to the local computer store. The enthusiasm for home-built PCs has carried over into my adult years.

My first couple of builds started my freshman year in college. Following in my father's footsteps, I took trips to my university surplus sales and put together fairly decent builds from old parts. It was a ton of fun (and a whole lot of learning) putting together "scrap" parts and creating computers that worked fairly well.

Fast-forward to my junior year (3rd year) in university. I landed a decent job as a student doing system administration in various campus computer labs. I saved up money over a year and built my very first gaming rig. It was still extremely budget, with an OC'd Intel E5200 CPU paired with an low-end GeForce GPU (don't remember which one). Pretty good for CounterStrike 1.6!

Fast-forward to graduation a couple of years later. I get my first career job as an entry-level web developer. At this point, I'm making decent money and playing more demanding games. So, I decided to build a mid-range rig with an Intel i7-860 CPU and paired with an AMD Radeon HD 5850. Played all kinds of games with this baby: CounterStrike Source, L4D, Simcity 4, ANNO Series. Noticed it could handle most things, but not everything. Ended up selling this to some high schoolers.

Now, it's 2014. This past October, I got married. Since the pattern for me has been, "Big life event? Build a gaming PC!", I decide to keep it going. I spent a month scouring Tom's Hardware, Anandtech, and /r/buildapc. I felt the rush of mixing and matching parts, increasing and decreasing budgets, and reading over benchmark charts. The research is the most riveting part of this hobby!


I've rambled on, but thanks for reading, if you did! Now, I'm going to go fire up Global Offensive and relearn how to navigate de_dust. Thanks so much /r/buildapc!


**TL;DR - I grew up building PCs. On major life events, I build gaming rigs. This is my latest build.**

This is an evolution of my two previous threads:

[First Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2luc91/build_help_rts_gaming_system_suggestions_650usd/)

[Second Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2m0i4i/build_help_650_gaming_build_w_ocd_g3258/)

Notes:

* After MUCH consideration and debate, I've decided to forego an OC'd G3258 and just pony up for an i5. Better gaming performance along with the added comfort of easily multitasking if I wanted to.

* There is something really cool about packing a ton of power into a compact box. Other mini-ITX builds on here have inspired me to try one myself.

Questions:

* Is the NZXT PSU enough to power this system? Is it overkill? PCPartPicker says 398W, but maybe some breathing room is good? Any recommendations here?

* I'm also going to get [this low-profile CPU cooler by Rosewill](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835200057) to save space in the CM Elite 130. Is this worth it? Any other low-profile fans to recommend?

Any recommendations appreciated. Going to purchase next week! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-11-17 11:40:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll keep this one short, but I could really use some help. I've got an older system I built way back in 2008. I'm thinking about upgrading the CPU and GPU. Also going to throw an SSD in there. It would cost me roughly $300 to get the following:

* Intel C2Q Q9650 (3.0 GHz)
* Gigabyte P45 Mobo
* Power Cooler R9 270
* 4 GB DDR2 800 (2x2) RAM
* Silverstone ST400 400W PSU

What kind of gaming performance would I be able to get out of this? I play some FPS and RTS games (SC2, CS:GO). I'd also like to play stuff like Sim City and Civ5.

Would it be better to pair the R9 270 with an entirely new system with the G3258?

Open to discussion. Thanks so much! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for some help picking out a small case/tower for my gaming build. I really like this [Rosewill Line-M](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147166) case, but it has a top-mounted PSU. I've always seen that bottom-mounted PSUs are more efficient in terms of cooling, so I was wondering if there is a case out there similar to this one, but with a bottom-mounted PSU.

I'm also open to other cases. I'd like it to be relatively small (Micro ATX motherboard). My price range is $60.

Things to note:

* I've decided to OC the G3258 with the stock fan/heatsink. As others have mentioned, I should be fine. However, I'd like to get 25-40% increase in clock-speed (from 3.2 GHz to 4GHz). Will I be able to achieve this on the stock cooling parts without having it burn out in the next 2 years or so? If not, does anyone have suggestions on good cooling without breaking the bank?

* I've decided on the R9 280 (versus my previous choice of 270X). This seems to be the most recommended "budget" GPU. I'm hoping I'll be able to OC the CPU and run this GPU on the Rosewill 550W PSU. Does anyone have experience with Rosewill PSUs? Newegg rates it pretty high (5 stars) and I haven't heard/seen super negative reviews on it, but I could be mistaken.

* On the note of PSUs, PCPartPicker tells me my estimated wattage will be 337W, while the GPU asks for a minimum of 600W. If I OC the CPU with this GPU, will the 550W PSU be enough? It's got 43A on a single 12V, so I'm thinking I'll be fine, but it doesn't hurt to ask. I don't want to fry my parts! On the flip side, would the 550W be overkill?

* I play mostly RTSs and city-sims. Don't know if thats too relevant, considering people tell me that the performance will depend on the individual game more than the genre.

Thanks for all the help so far!

<TEXT> Background: I'm a short-time lurker on /r/buildapc, but on-and-off system builder since 2008. First build was an Intel E5200 w/o GPU. Second build was an Intel I7-860 w/ HD 5850. I generally enjoy RTS, city-building, and simulator type games, but I sometimes play FPS games like CS:Source and L4D.

I'm looking for an upgraded version of my last computer (2009). I'd like to play RTS and city-sims (SimCity, SC2, Civ-5) at the highest settings, smoothly. I'm guessing 60 fps average?

Here is the build I'm thinking of:

Things to note:

* I am going to OC the G3258 as much as possible to get the gaming performance I want. I was originally going to go with an Intel i5 4460, but [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2lsvze/discussion_g3258_packs_a_big_punch_even_before/) made me strongly consider the G3258! I'm thinking I can get good RTS performance from the dual-core, but I'm open to being convinced otherwise.

* Not listed is a CPU cooler. I used an AF Pro 7 in my first build and a CM Hyper 212 on my second build. Any suggestions for an 1150 CPU cooler that will help with the G3258 OC without killing my wallet?

* Will the R9 270X meet my gaming requirements? I was also considering a GTX 760, but the price of the 270X was more convincing for me. Is there any noticeable advantage of picking one over the other other than cost?

I'm open to any suggestions at all on the build. I'm just getting started, but I'm hoping to order during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday season. I honestly can't wait to build my 3rd rig!

Thanks in advance!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been planning on replacing all my shoes. I've never been particularly picky about my shoes, but after browsing around MFA, I realized I need a nice, basic set of footwear. I'm trying to find pieces that will go well with my standard outfit (jeans/khakis, OCBD/long-sleeve tee). So far, I've decided on:

* Vans Authentic (True White) http://www.vans.com/shop/canvas-authentic-true-white
* Clarks Bushacre 2 (Beeswax) http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Mens-Bushacre-2-Boot/dp/B00B1I5KFU

I'm looking for another casual shoe that would work well with my outfit. Any recommendations on my selections are welcome as well.

Thanks so much, MFA.

edit: My budget is less than $80 for this last pair. For all three pairs, I'd like to spend no more than $200-$220 on all three pairs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi MFA! I've been browsing much of the Fall/Autumn/Winter inspiration albums lately and decided that I want to purchase a nice, versatile fall jacket. I plan to layer one other article of clothing under it, most likely an OCBD or flannel. I work in software in a really casual office in Seattle, so I don't need it to be too fancy.

I'm trying to figure out what kind of jackets these are so I can make my search a bit easier. Some recommendations wouldn't hurt either! My price range $50-$100. Thanks in advanced.

Came to look at my car this morning and noticed a bunch of scratches around the gas cap and fender.

Is there any way to tell if people put stuff in my tank?

<TITLE> 3.5" Lift - Adjustable Track Bar? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-26 20:31:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Greetings! So, I installed a 3.5" lift (Rubicon Express) on the front of my XJ a couple of weeks back. Now, I'm experiencing some weird steering issues and I think it might be my track bar. When I was putting on the extended sway bar links, I had trouble getting the driver side link to line up well with the stock sway bar. Is there any other way to fully confirm that my axle is off?

I'm thinking that the track bar is the issue, so I'm looking into getting one without breaking the bank. I was looking at this one from Rough Country: http://www.roughcountry.com/adjustable-track-bar-7572.html

Will I need any additional hardware? Is it as simple as a pull off, bolt on?

Any advice/help is appreciated, thanks all!

<TITLE> Weddings, Parents, and the god damn Guestlist! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-29 07:18:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm getting married this fall. It'll be relatively small (150 guests). I, personally, just want to be married to the woman I love without going into fucking debt. I'm sorry, but I'm not trying to drop $50k on a one-day party for people to come eat a free meal and drink themselves blind in "the name of our love".

My parents want to invite all sorts of people I haven't fucking seen in years and can barely remember their names. Her parents, who are worse, want to invite even more guests on her side. It's supposed to be an even split, but her side has like 10 more because her mother keeps bitching about a bunch of people I've never fucking met in my entire relationship with my future wife.

I know it's common to have weddings taken over by other people (parents, to be exact), but god damn I wish we were planing a small wedding with immediate family only. At the very least, we wouldn't have to break the bank to feed a bunch of freeloading relatives and have our parents bitch about how "John Doe from Podunk, USA once wiped my ass as a child and should be invited to the wedding."

I finally, FINALLY, understand how couples go fucking apeshit over wedding guestlists. This is, by far, the shittiest part of this entire god damned process.

Word of advice to intelligent couples everywhere: have a small wedding or nothing at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow XJers!

I drove over some trails over the weekend, nothing too rough, but definitely got to bounce around. I went to start it up one morning and heard a clunking noise right underneath the center console area. It was like someone was sitting underneath the vehicle and knocking on the bottom of the vehicle. As soon as the engine turned over, the sound went away.

It is better on some days than others, but consistent with starting up the vehicle. Went underneath, shook my pipes, drive shaft, etc. Checked to make sure nothing was hitting the crossmember under the t-case. Nothing is noticeably loose at first glance. Any ideas on what it could be? Pebble get into something?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, the rear end of my XJ sits a bit higher than my front. I'd like to even this out a bit. I've got 2" spacers in front already, so I'd like to NOT add another .5" - 1" spacer.

Instead, I'd like to swap out the coils, but I'm on a budget. According to Rocklizard Fab (http://www.rocklizardfabrications.com/home_brew_budget_boost.htm), you can use ZJ coils to add 1" lift! 

Has anyone personally done this themselves? Where did you get the coils?

After looking, I found these on Rockauto: http://www.rockauto.com/catalog/moreinfo.php?pk=201281 cc=1315973

Since I'm taking apart the diffies, anything I should replace? Bolts? Plugs? Hoses?

I'm actually stoked to be doing this. Something about new fluids in my Jeep that make me feel happy.. lol.

I'd like to replace the stock shocks to get a little smoother of a ride and a bit more vertical travel. I've got got a 2" BB on it right now.

I was browsing JeepForum and CherokeeTalk (via Google), and found some old threads on the topic. However, I'd like to see if anyone has any other more 'up-to-date' recommendations.

So far from my research, the top brands are Bilstein and OME. Has this changed over the last couple of years? 

Thanks everyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to purchase a lift kit for my 98 Cherokee XJ and I'm still debating if I should just let a mechanic do it for me. It's my daily driver, so I can't mess up and have it garaged for more than a weekend.

Anyway, does anyone have recommendations on Jeep garages in the Seattle area? First hand experience with the mechanic would be nice. It'd also be nice to know if there are any other XJers out here!

Thanks in advanced! </TEXT>
