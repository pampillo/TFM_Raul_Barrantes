 As for democracy, there hasn't been democracy in this system to begin with; the US is about the illusion of democracy only. Do you think a real democracy spies on its own citizens, lies to them about it, is caught, is ordered to stop, and then... doesn't?

Technically the answer to this is yes if that is what the people of the democracy voted for, well except for the lying.

<TEXT> I think invading Afghanistan was a mistake, but lets not pretend that the Taliban didn't do more than *that*! They harbored the prick, and refused to hand him over when pressed (frankly at gunpoint)... it was a mistake. The result has been terrible for everyone involved, and ironically it is precisely what people like bin Laden wanted and groups like Daesh want today.

They want a worldwide religious war, and they can't have that if we're all struggling to get along, only if we're at each other's throats.

Still... that hardly excuses the Taliban! </TEXT>

That's generally the reasoning behind campaign contribution limits prior to Citizens United. Now of course, thousands of people can all contribute and be massively outspent by just... one guy. The Koch Bros. or Soros or just a large company/lobbying group is going to be able to offer a far more *memorable* deal than you or me. 

In the end, CU undermined precisely the natural controls you're pretending are still in place. The best thing you're ignoring by the way, is that *I don't need to bribe you in the first place*.

Incompetent

<TEXT> It is really awful, and as I said it caused quite the furor. It is however, of a fundamentally different character than raping someone. It's cruel, it's thoughtless, and the kind of thing a group of young people can get carried away with; you might not realize just how bad the situation is until it's finished unfolding.

"Get the the kid and tie him to the sculpture!" can turn into, "Yeah and pants him!" which turns into stripping... and then a couple of the truly screwed-up people piss on him. What started as a bad idea, and turned into a *really* bad idea, didn't really become monstrous until the very end. 

There is no point at which you're penetrating someone with a broomstick, when you can mistake that for something other than what it is. "Go for their ass" is not the cry of people who have pranks or hazing on their mind, they're just nuts who happen to be young. </TEXT>

I mean... hazing can be brutal, but I honestly can't recall (in real life) a case when it was... rape. People get taped to walls or flagpoles, and in one case I remember someone being stripped, tied spread-eagles to a sculpture, and then two people pissed on him. That was... pretty bad to be honest, and it set off a round of anti-hazing measures at the time.

If someone had been raped with a broom... the police would have been involved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People act like WL do the hacking themselves. If people don't leak them docs they can't publish them. If WL doesn't want to publish certain docs then you can call them biased but you can't dispute the evidence and you have to consider it.

This is the problem... and it's an *old* way to defame people. The truth, whether you like it or not, is that a lot of people do a lot of 'wrong' things, and the numbers look worse when you look into politics and business. That shouldn't be acceptable, but here's how you can make it *look* like you care, while only helping or hurting some people.

So, I have information which says basically... everyone in Group X is corrupt. Instead of releasing that however, you could just... target certain members of Group X. You won't be telling any lies, you'll just be releasing "truth" in a selective way designed to mislead people. 

That's a very generous assumption by the way; often you might target someone over an emotive issue to cover up for a more important one. Maybe you have a far-right candidate who is essentially a neo-Nazi, and a standard POS politician up against her. So, you release the *accurate* info on one, and simply let the other go. You haven't lied, but you've given the impression that one party is corrupt and not the other.

All by selectively telling the truth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How often do you think that someone breaks into a home while the homeowner is there? It's the classic macho-fantasy, but how often do you think it actually happens?

When it comes to gang violence, how much of that violence do you think involves random people, and not other gang members?

<TEXT> 1) No, they aren't. Kansas, for example, has a significantly lower poverty rate than, say, California.

Uh huh... now lets compare median income and property values. 

2) Wood construction is standard in the US, even in high-end housing. However, when the cost of housing is 1/10th that of LA or NYC, material cost becomes much more important.

Yes, it is standard, but then most of the US population doesn't live with the threat of a tornado. 

3) A strong F3 or above will relocate a brick home just as easily as a wood frame.

Yes, but that's not why people in places like Okie still don't often have good storm shelters, that's a matter of money and the depth of bedrock. 

4) The odds of a tornado hitting a particular house is very slim. Much more cost efficient to have a single reinforced room.

Unless that room is underground, see your comment #3. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's usually meant to protect against the kind of thing we see here sometimes in the US, when some old bastard decides that "Castle Doctrine" means it's a fire sale on murder. You're allowed to defend yourself, and if that means killing a potentially armed intruder, so be it. A lot of these laws cover the less savory outcomes, like chasing them and then killing them, or restraining them and killing them. 

Very few countries in the Western world don't allow for you to kill in self defense.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...Because sometimes people don't leave their windows open; in fact the people you probably most want to home-invade are probably pretty paranoid about you doing just that. It's also very hard to perform the kind of low-effort mass SIGINT of just... reading everyone's messages and mail, when people encrypt. 

They don't want to break into houses, they want to have a master key and you just trust them not to abuse it. "They" in this case, is not just the UK either, it's the US, and many other governments. In China they're more invasive, but also a lot more open about the fact that they're invading every part of someone's life. Here you're supposed to cheer about some magical concept of absolute freedom while everything you say and do is algorithmically scrutinized. </TEXT>

Most people at any age wouldn't seriously consider SWATting someone, and few of the ones who would consider it would actually do it. Not to mention that 16 is fairly developed from a neurological perspective; you're potentially old enough to move on from a diagnosis of "Conduct Disorder" to "Anti-Social Personality Disorder" for example.

Step 1: Spend years smearing anyone who using encryption as either paranoid, or criminal, especially a terrorist or a pedo. 
 
Step 2: Link high-profile crimes to "encryption" and refer back to Step 1.

Step 3: When public sentiment shifts, possibly after an inevitable attack, shove through legislation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has been asked and answered a lot, so I'm going to be brief:

Current fusion schemes produce high energy neutrons which cause atomic sputtering of the reactor, turning previously strong materials brittle. There is no known way to prevent this, and a practical power plant needs to spend most of its time generating power, not down for maintenance. 

D-T Fusion is the most commonly explored, and it requires Tritium which is rare, radioactive, and is currently produced by fission reactors.

D-T Fusion requires a "breeding blanket" which can produce tritium fuel, otherwise you're just using fission plants to crank out tritium very inefficiently and at great expense, producing high-grade waste, etc. 

The diverter: a way to channel some of the plasma out of the reaction (in toroidal designs at least) is *incredibly* hard to model, and the instabilities in introduces are problematic, also leading to rapid wear.

In general, modern fusion reactors (not power plants, such a thing is nowhere near realized) can't run for very long, or very often before parts need to be replaced. 

This is related to the issue of the plasma coming into contact with the chamber, which burns the chamber and cools the plasma; both are undesirable outcomes. 

It is almost comically difficult to squeeze plasma with magnets to the incredible densities/temps required for fusion on Earth. It takes a lot of computing power, experimentation, time, and money; none of which is about producing a power plant, but just about learning more about how plasma works under those circumstances.

There are a lot of reasons to have hope for fusion as a source of power... in a hundred years or more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh it's a lot... for a lot of people he's just seen as a moron, he believes in homeopathy... that kind of thing. 

It's not that he's seen as a bad person, just... a complete tool. There's an excellent answer by one David Stewart over on Quora:

https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Prince-Charles-unpopular

He's never really been a man of the people. He has a very posh voice, a very aloof demeanour and his attempts to connect with average people often comes across looking like someone desperately trying to conceal their true feelings, which appear to be a sort of baffled contempt.

While Britain is trying to modernise he still comes across as a guy who hasn't found anything funny since the Goon Show stopped broadcasting and only likes music if it's older than he is.

It doesn't help that the issues he seems to really care about don't connect with the people at all. While many of his subjects are struggling to make ends meet and concerned about big issues of the day, Prince Charles is really, really concerned about modern architecture which he loathes and despises. Instead of getting passionate about the state of public schooling or the something that affects people's day to day lives, he gets worked up because someone is designing a building he doesn't like. He's also concerned about the fact that scientific based medicine that has been tested and found effective takes precedence over homeopathy in the NHS. Something that hasn't endeared him to the medical profession and a lot of other people.

Of course what really drove the last nail in the coffin of his public perception was the fact that he was cheating on his beloved and adored and attractive young wife Diana with the unpopular, hated, older and unattractive Camilla. It was seen as a betrayal of the People's Princess (whose infidelity was forgiven for some reason).

<TEXT> Sauce: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/scientists-find-giant-wave-rolling-through-the-perseus-galaxy-cluster

Combining data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory with radio observations and computer simulations, an international team of scientists has discovered a vast wave of hot gas in the nearby Perseus galaxy cluster. Spanning some 200,000 light-years, the wave is about twice the size of our own Milky Way galaxy.

The researchers say the wave formed billions of years ago, after a small galaxy cluster grazed Perseus and caused its vast supply of gas to slosh around an enormous volume of space.

"Perseus is one of the most massive nearby clusters and the brightest one in X-rays, so Chandra data provide us with unparalleled detail," said lead scientist Stephen Walker at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "The wave we've identified is associated with the flyby of a smaller cluster, which shows that the merger activity that produced these giant structures is still ongoing." </TEXT>

We have to remember though, that the internet has more people from a broader slice of life talking to each other than ever before. It can be tempting to assign the results of a greater experience with our fellow human to some new factor.

<TEXT> The news and political subs of Reddit attract them like flies. Moderators on Reddit, even the truly well-meaning ones, still lack the tools to actually ban people who don't want to stay banned. The result is the endless flood of "new" accounts with the same old shit to say. If they get someone else banned, so much the better for them, and if they get banned... so what? Roll a new account, and call it a day. 

The problem is that from the moderator's perspective, the sum total of their power really comes down to pressing one of a few buttons, all of which rely on someone basically agreeing to the process. So... we wade through shit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is, if you're god, you can be subtle in a profound way. I think the best discussion of this in some form I've heard is from Jim Butcher's *Dresden Files* in regards to his concept of fallen angels. In essence, even without *any* power their age, knowledge, and incredible perspective of a *vast* time and multitude of lives makes them insanely formidable. Needless to say something with *all* of the knowledge of *everything* is another step up.

That being the case, a huge number of things could avert catastrophe, even before catastrophe was evident. After all, sea level rise is a symptom of a larger problem, and by averting the cause (emissions, energy demand, energy production, human population size, etc) you could simply annul the problem.

<TEXT> In the case of teeth that's a bit different; there's a live nerve inside of a healthy tooth, and it's *sensitive* as you learned; even through a layer of dentin. People with horribly rotted teeth have certainly experienced incredible pain for a while... then the nerve died, and that was that. No nerve, no pain, but mind you that's not necessarily a good thing. Rotting teeth and unhealthy gums are *dangerous* in a chronic sense, but also in terms of a risk for dangerous infections of the mouth and jaw.

Pain is at the end of the day, a warning, but it can go wrong. As to evolutionary purpose... crippling chronic pain is not evolved, it's a breakdown of the human being. Most of the time though, it's not going to happen during your most fertile breeding years, right?

"Evolution" such as it is, gives no shits about you if you can pass along your genes; if what's killing you wouldn't show up until much later... womp womp. </TEXT>

On the scale of a power plant... it may or may not be feasible. A lot of people on Reddit seem to think that fusion research now is about "building a power plant" or finding a good power plant design. Really, it's nowhere near that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's an important distinction... you're getting more energy than you put into it, but *not* more energy than was put into it. As /u/shadydentist said you can burn hydrocarbons and release energy, *but* it took energy to assemble those hydrocarbons in the first place... it's just that none of us expended that energy. In the case of fission, you're splitting atoms that already exist; you didn't expend the energy to create them in the first place. 

In the case of fusion, it's a bit different on the surface, because you're creating a new element and harvesting some of the excess energy of that reaction. The total binding energy of the new Helium nucleus is a bit lower than the total binding energy of the nucleons which formed it, and that excess can't vanish, so it's released. Fusion is all about harvesting that excess; you want to spend less energy fusing H, or He, or whatever, than you can theoretically get out of the reaction. 

That... is the hard part. Without a star's mass of material to work with, it's tough to fuse atoms; they have a strong mutual repulsion you have to overcome (Coulomb Barrier). In a reactor you can't have a giant mass, so you need high pressures and temperatures... that's hard, and it takes a lot of energy. 

That said, there are some energetically favorable pathways to nuclear fusion, by using "fuel" that already exists (now we're getting back to the start of this post) such as 2 and 3 isotopes of Hydrogen (Deuterium, Tritium). Deuterium is plentiful, but Tritium is definitely *not*.

The sad truth is that the very rich are not necessarily the very smart or the very technically minded; they may well be the types who think that money and a metric ton of nerds can solve any problem.

https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/scientists-find-giant-wave-rolling-through-the-perseus-galaxy-cluster

Combining data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory with radio observations and computer simulations, an international team of scientists has discovered a vast wave of hot gas in the nearby Perseus galaxy cluster. Spanning some 200,000 light-years, the wave is about twice the size of our own Milky Way galaxy.

The researchers say the wave formed billions of years ago, after a small galaxy cluster grazed Perseus and caused its vast supply of gas to slosh around an enormous volume of space.

"Perseus is one of the most massive nearby clusters and the brightest one in X-rays, so Chandra data provide us with unparalleled detail," said lead scientist Stephen Walker at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "The wave we've identified is associated with the flyby of a smaller cluster, which shows that the merger activity that produced these giant structures is still ongoing." </TEXT>

Good times.

*catch*

http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05226

25 out of the total 118 (21%) ministers in government were in the House of Lords. 

This compares to 23% at the start of the 2015 Cameron administration and 20% at the start of the 2010 Coalition Government. 

That's pretty fair representation across three governments...

Mind you, that still requires that you not consider their role in Parliament as somehow "part of government" in the first place. 

Fortunately I spent about ten seconds glancing at your comment history... and before this lovely chat you mostly seem to be telling people to shut up or fuck off. Bit out of your depth here, aren't you? </TEXT>

Also as expected, sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism scores were positively correlated with self-reported enjoyment of trolling, all rs  .37 (see Table 1), even when controlling for overall Internet use, all rs  .39. Narcissism, in contrast, was not correlated with trolling enjoyment, but was instead positively correlated with enjoying debating issues important to them. Vicarious sadism was similarly positively correlated with enjoyment of debating, while enjoyment of chatting was negatively correlated with psychopathy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If cost were not an issue? Yeah, I think it would be doable, as others have said there are a lot of materials that are technically available which might not commonly be used due to expense. The problem is that most of them would be unproven due to expense or rarity too, so who really knows?

I mean... I personally think that you could probably roll out something very like MBT armor, only thicker and designed more with resistence to corrosion and erosion in mind rather than anti-tank weaponry, and probably expect it to last for a long damned time. 

You'd need some incredible stone/earth-works to make sure the land wasn't simply buried in dust/sand, and you'd need to pick a spot like... Arizona.

But yeah, it's doable, and although it's not exactly about in habitability, the considerations of long-lasting structures are not new. http://www.wipp.energy.gov/picsprog/articles/wipp%20exhibit%20message%20to%2012,000%20a_d.htm </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's an old term which describes particular percentages of gold vs. other metals used to alloy it. 


999.999six nines fine: the purest gold ever produced. Refined by the Perth Mint in 1957.[3][4]

999.99five nines fine: the purest type of gold currently produced; the Royal Canadian Mint regularly produces commemorative coins in this fineness

999.9four nines fine: e.g., ordinary Canadian Gold Maple Leaf and American Buffalo coins

99924 karat, also occasionally known as three nines fine: e.g., Chinese Gold Panda coins

995: the minimum allowed in Good Delivery gold bars

990two nines fine

986Ducat fineness: formerly used by Venetian and Holy Roman Empire mints; still in use in Austria and Hungary

958.323 karat

91622 karat: historically the most widely used fineness for gold bullion coins; currently used for British Sovereigns, South African Krugerrands and American Gold Eagles

900one nine fine: mostly used in Latin Monetary Union mintage (e.g. French and Swiss "Napoleon coin" 20 francs)

83420 karat

75018 karat

62515 karat

58514 karat

41710 karat

3769 karat

3338 karat

With the number to the left being the percentage of pure gold out of 1000, so 750 (18 Karat) = 75% pure gold by weight.

<TEXT> Don't worry about your sentence structure, I found you perfectly understandable. So, to answer your question lets think about life *today*, alright? We know, all of us, that driving a car is dangerous, and that most of us will be in at least one accident. Some of us will be seriously injured, and many thousands die every year. 

BUT...

...We do it anyway. We see cars as a necessary and vital part of life, and are willing to accept a certain amount of reasonable risk to get around faster, and cheaper. 

The risks of travel in the time of the Hindenburg were not much better to be honest, and air travel was especially primitive. If you wanted to move a lot of people a long way, pretty much the only options were overland, or by ship. A giant zeppelin could have changed that, inherent risks and all. 

When you're talking about a cutting-edge technology, it's always a debate, and you have to think about it from the point of view of someone at the time. You could cross an ocean in comfort and relative safety in a dirigible... or go in a boat. It wasn't really understood just *how* dangerous the setup of the Hindenburg was; and Hydrogen is *much* cheaper and easier to get your hands on than similar quantities of something like Helium.

So... bottom line tl;dr to your question?

Hope.
Greed.
Ambition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From an evolutionary perspective, there is value to novelty, and novelty-seeking behavior, but the safest court is generally to stick with the group. If everyone else is skittish around feeding time, and runs when they think a tiger is coming, but Thag doesn't... well... maybe we're not descended from Thag. More generally, for most of human/hominid history being in the group was a matter of life or death, a matter of being able to enjoy mutual grooming, defense, and sharing food. 

So we have millions of years of that, backed up by thousands of years of social evolution driven by that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's almost always a (state) constitutional issue, but honestly pro se defense is not the norm, and the courts are *required* to admonish the defendant, but... you know... "State's Rights" and all of that. 

The truth is that most of the people representing themselves are delusional. The bottom line though, is that for whatever reason they have that constitutional right; it may be that it comes from a time when it could have made a bit more sense, I'm not a legal historian, sorry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not responding to demands, that's not what the burden of proof is. What it really means is that when you make a positive claim (such as, "Glyphosate is not safe.") people should only take it as seriously as you're willing to support it. 

You're free not to support it, and I'm then free to dismiss it with a wave of a hand; one begets the other. In the same way, citation isn't a game of numbers, but a matter of quality; you're supporting a point you make, that's all. 

In essence, you made a claim which is (to use your word) a "demand" to be believed. Why should anyone simply believe what you say?

If you knew Monsanto like I know Monsanto, you wouldn't be defending them. Oh wait, you do. Shill.

*lol*

This is great. If you go back a week or so in my comment history you can actually see the argument I got into with some Libertarians defending Monsanto with the same fervor you're attacking them. They accused me of being a secret GMO-hating far-leftie. 

It's almost like the two extremes of this debate are full of polarized assholes who can't have a reasonable debate...

Edit: ... I have to add by the way, that if you're accusing me of knowing Monsanto like you "know Monsanto" and *also* accusing me of being a shill... you do understand that you'd be saying you're a shill, right? No? You didn't?

By the same token, China allows this because they are 100% about unity, and the notion of millions of ethnic Koreans flooding their border horrifies them.

Not to mention that a united Korea almost certainly means the US military on their doorstep.

<TEXT> There is nothing new in that lawsuit, it's just two people alleging what people on Reddit do all of the time, and seemingly with no more evidence. The notion that Monsanto (like any massive company) actively spins, PR's, and goes after online commentary is neither new, or surprising. 

The questions which matter in regards to Monsanto have to do with paid or ghost-written research, concerns that they might have (or might in the future) go down the ADM lysine route, and other issues. 

You can dislike companies like Monsanto without turning them into special cases of bogeymen in your mind. Monsanto is not somehow magically different from ADM, or Pfizer, or Kraft, or Nestle, or Exxon, or Boeing. The issues with one are largely the issues with the other, but people are just so confused, paranoid, or ideologically fucked to have a conversation with. </TEXT>

Water would cease to be an issue overnight, along with recycling, disposal of trash, pollution, transport, etc. The notion of an economy as it exists today wouldn't make much sense after very little time, and poverty as we know it today would eventually end. 

A lot of the hardest living around the world is predicated on power being relatively expensive and difficult to generate and transmit, but this would not be the case.

<TEXT> There are some indications that a total nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan would have global consequences on climate, with the potential to cause at least a few years of severe famine in some regions. Even if we ignore every other aspect of two hugely populous nations potentially killing each other off, we'd have to consider broader economic and humanitarian issues.

<TEXT> From an app they could ask you to fill out forms you might hesitate to fill out on a website, and they can just ask "permissions" to track anything you'll let them, including location data. This ties in with the notifications; lets say McDonalds wants you to use their app and not their site. So their app might vibrate your phone with a notification when you're near a McDonalds, offering you a limited time-only coupon for a free small fries. 

It's not that a site can't do all of the same things (and better in some cases), but for the company they get better engagement when they live in your phone or tablet, rather than waiting for you to come to them. As an app they're also there, in your life, more than they are as one of a million sites you *could* visit.  </TEXT>

With a UTI you want to *avoid* inflammation. If you want to stimulate the production of urine, iced or regular tea can be a good choice, without packing on the calories of loads of cranberry juice. That, and cranberry juice really has no proven link to helping; it's just a matter of passing enough fluid, avoiding inflammation, good sanitation, and if needed antibiotics.  </TEXT>

This is not even wrong... A meta-analysis that ignores the last 4 years of massive change and newly available research? 

It would be funny, but under this administration it's just sad.

<TEXT> You're not wrong, but when discussing the general technological (rather than social) level of a civilization, the material used for tools is *very* useful. The nature of hunting, of warfare, agriculture, etc...all change *radically* when metal becomes the primary working material. 

I'm not trying to diminish the accomplishments of the Aztecs, Mayans, Olmec, etc... I'm just pointing out the truth which fundamentally got them all killed; they didn't have much metal, or the knowledge of how to use it. In some cases that meant that a city-state might actually exceed its local capacity to feed its people; at some point you need metal tools to support huge numbers of people efficiently in a small region. Tilling with wooden plows is *much* harder than even a small additional metal front to the blade, and that's just agriculture. 

Then you have the problem of warfare; there wasn't much to be done with people covered in metal, with guns and blades, on horseback showed up. It's true that those invaders got some lucky breaks, but even without that it wasn't going to end well for the natives for a number of reasons.

<TEXT> There is no known significance to the order in which you consume alcoholic beverages, although I've heard speculation that maybe ultimately those rhymes are meant to be a *guide*. I.E. if you take some shots to get somewhat lit, then switch to beer to maintain you could do well. By contrast, if you start off with some beer, then get the bright idea to take shots... maybe you wake up in the gutter.

It's not the order or the liquor, it's maybe more of an indication of behavioral patterns?

I'm not sure if anyone has done a uh... a nutritional analysis of human eggs. I would of course point out (what I suspect you know) that they are *very* small; in essence you'd need quite a few women's lifetime output for an... omelette. 

That said, I'm pretty sure (based on what I know about the human ovum) that it would lack the key properties of chicken eggs. Human eggs don't have albumin, a "yolk", lecithin, or anything you expect from eggs in the culinary sense. The human egg doesn't carry its own food with it it; that's provided by the uterine lining and placenta. Really, when we eat eggs, we're not *mostly* eating the little fleck of genetic info, but the large "food store" for growing the baby outside of the mother. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Egg yolks are incredible emulsifiers; they help fat-based and water-based substances form finer blends. If you took a (pasteurized) raw egg yolk and added to it your salad dressing of oil and vinegar, you'd find that the the whole thing would form a creamy suspension that would stay together for a while. 

Meanwhile the egg white are basically water and protein, which as /u/mb34i said can do some pretty impressive tricks. The bonus is that the fat in the yolks, and the water in the whites already have an emulsifier in the yolk; the egg is a complete kit to emulsify itself and anything else. An omelette, or scrambled eggs, is just such an emulsion, cooked. On its own, the white can also be whipped up into a tight froth and used to add air and volume to something that would otherwise not be raised, such as meringue, souffle, or mousse. 

When you add all of those things and use them in different combinations, you have the reason for eggs popularity in cuisine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Birds have a fundamentally different structure from our "voice-box"; whereas humans have a larynx, birds have a syrinx: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(bird_anatomy)

The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our drug problems wouldn't disappear... there would still be a lot of people on drugs, but it would be a step in the right direction to decriminalize drugs, at the very least. Talking about a lack of "magic processes," if you think that somehow making drugs legal is the path to a happy and easy life for society, you're nuts. 

It's not a *good* way of dealing with the problem, it just happens to be the *only* way... it's still going to be very hard and costly, and take a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ceramic knives do exist, in fact I have a small ceramic paring knife; it's sharper than death itself. That said, I've gone through two of them, because they tend to chip and break without much provocation. 

As for a plastic knife, I'd imagine it wouldn't hold a point or edge for very long, and if you made it very hard, it would also run the risk of shattering. 

Honestly, lots of *metal* knives that aren't explicitly (and well) made to kill people, aren't very good at it. A very sharp blade with no weight, no balance, and whatever you've jerry-rigged for a handle is unlikely to win you an aircraft for example. Even on 9/11, the power of something like a box-cutter died off once people realized what their options really were: fight and maybe die, or die. 

When people get out of line on planes now, people swarm them, and if we're not talking about a plane then the odds are you're not that far from someone with a *real* knife, or a gun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some people have a larger lung-volume than others, it could have to do with temperature, but mostly it's going to be a matter of the rate at which you're breathing. Humans exhale quite a bit of water, but at rest, in a car, most of us tend to breathe pretty slowly through our noses, which minimizes the rate at which we're releasing water vapor. 

So... mouth-breathers, people who for whatever reason are breathing more deeply/rapidly, that kind of thing will contribute.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're firing into a crowd, you don't have an intent to kill someone in particular, as you say, but you're trying to kill. Murder requires intent, but it doesn't require that you formulate a particular target except in the moment of the crime (for 2nd degree that is). No reasonable person could expect that firing into a crowd is an attempt to murder people. 

By contrast, firing blindly into a room *could* be a lot of things, including being so careless and depraved that you'd be set up for 2nd degree murder. The crowd though... that's mass-shooter territory.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's mostly used in "depleted" form because it's very *very* dense, and its has a property called pyrophoricity, which means that it reacts very strongly with air (burning essentially). Depleted uranium slugs can be fired at very high speeds, and since Force = Mass x Acceleration, a dense, hard slug is packing a big punch. The pyrophoric effect also means that the tip "sharpens" itself en route, rather than deforming. 

Very... very nasty stuff. 

Beyond that, Uranium could be used in nuclear reactors for power vessels for conventional combat.  </TEXT>
