<TEXT> You'd think so right? I work in addiction in Scotland, usually closely with Social Workers who for the most part are under extreme pressure from their bosses in terms of case load. There is a high level of disillusionment about the unions and organising because the unions have been very ineffective in improving these conditions. I'm currently trying to re-unionise my workplace, but it will take a while to bring people round and I don't think it will be with the assistance of the already established unions here.

I think the radical feelings are there, they just haven't been catalysed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been out since January due to a stupid foot issue. I've been taking the time to work in more strength work, doing body weight circuits 3 times a week. I also get out on my bike for a long ride at the weekends + 2 or so days on an exercise bike in the gym. It's not the same but I feel like I'm gonna be at peak condition for starting again when I can. Hope that helps!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a combination of the zero drop, wide toe box, and the way the shoes seem to encourage better, more responsive to terrain form in me.  Ideally I'm looking for something as close to minimal as possible, but still with enough forefoot padding to protect my sesamoids. Is that too fussy? I should probably just go to the store haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey - thanks for the advice! The podiatrist I saw didn't x-ray as he said that no matter what it was, his treatment plan would be the same. Orthotic insoles, no running, out for 8 weeks minimum, and massage/manipulation to boot. 

I figured that it would be one of those recurring assholes, so guess I'll finally cash out for the foam roller.

<TEXT> That's a complete misconception. The term 'higher power' and God is used frequently in AA but is not a religious God, or even a supernatural one. It is up to the individual to find their own understanding of God. For yourself you may believe that Bob Newhart is God, but the guy sitting next to you at a meeting may only use the concept of AA itself as power greater than him. The guy on the other side may not have any conception of a higher power at all. It's all individual choice. The use of 'cult' in relation to AA is also problematic as it potentially scares away people who may benefit from it, and I would argue that it is purely ignorance that spreads that belief. </TEXT>

 Take a break, compress and raise that as soon as possible, as much as possible.
 I ran on shin splints consistently foolishly for a while and ended up having to take 8 months out due to microfractures. When you start up again go easy, watch your foot strike. Maybe check your shoes too? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much as the title suggests. I'm going to Madrid over the weekend and won't have time to go running whilst I'm there. I'm usually running Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat with weight work on Tues/Thurs, Sunday's off. 
This weeks schedule goes 7x800m Fast 3 min recovery with 1 mile warm up/cool down either side 
2 x 2.5 mile fast with 1 mile warm up/cool down either side 
4 miles easy  
9miles total 5miles steady 3 miles fast 1 mile steady.

I think I'm gonna drop the 4 mile easy and keep the long run, rather than squeezing all 4 into the 5 days with only Wednesday as a rest day. What's the suggestions of folks here?
Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi folks, happy Friday to you all. I'm near 6 months into this now and I am having a ball, apart from having issues with being hella grumpy and unable to lift the feeling from time to time. Once every couple of weeks or so I start feeling irrationally grumpy/annoyed with everything... Almost like I'm spoiling for a fight. I can keep a handle on it most of the time but it leaves me being quite short with people, especially my partner, as she lives with me. Obviously this is rather unpleasant for me and for everyone else.  I was wondering if it's just me or if it's a common thing? And if it's not just me, how do you deal with it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're not bad pubs as such, but the dome is all about turnover rather than customer experience thus the fancy wetherspoons comparison.

<TEXT> I'm a Bartender/Waiter in a fancy cocktail place. Thinking of changing that, though I don't know what too.

Fry off some streaky smoky bacon then put aside.
Cook some flour in butter then add milk slowly to make a smooth white sauce and chuck in Mature Cheddar to make it a cheese sauce (don't forget to salt n' pepper). Combine with your cooked macaroni. Add bacon. Place half the pasta into a baking dish and liberally apply chunks of Brie and Gruyere. Cover with the rest of the pasta then sprinkle a whole bunch of mozzarella over the top. Bake until crispy on top. Taste sensations ensue. 

It's all about Kim Philby, essentially the biggest fuck up of Britain during the Cold War was allowing Mr Philby to rise to prominence as he was a soviet double agent. It's a great little look at his life and the secret service at that time in general.

Aye - Spain. She's moving to Scotland in July though, cannae wait!

<TEXT> Working all weekend unfortunately...

Nothing hilarious this week so far at work, just the usual.

I made a 4 cheese macaroni with bacon a few days ago that was hella good. All the cheese.

Been listening to a lot of old style English folk. Peter Bellamy, The Waterstons etc

Just finished a book on Kim Philby called "A Spy Among Friends" by Ben Macintyre. Pretty good if you like all the cloak and dagger history.

First thing would be a plane ticket to Spain to see my girlfriend. Then multiple shiny trinkets probably, I'm terrible with money...

Just been on holiday so it's a diet of bread and water for me now. Ah well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There were never strawberries
like the ones we had
that sultry afternoon
sitting on the step
of the open french window
facing each other
your knees held in mine
the blue plates in our laps
the strawberries glistening
in the hot sunlight
we dipped them in sugar
looking at each other
not hurrying the feast
for one to come
the empty plates
laid on the stone together
with the two forks crossed
and I bent towards you
sweet in that air
in my arms
abandoned like a child
from your eager mouth
the taste of strawberries
in my memory
lean back again
let me love you

let the sun beat
on our forgetfulness
one hour of all
the heat intense
and summer lightning
on the Kilpatrick hills

let the storm wash the plates

Of course this is debatable as Musselburgh's earliest inhabitants arrive around 80AD after the Roman invasion of Britain whereas Edinburgh already had a tribe of peoples known as the Votadini living in the area, although wether they actually had settled within the bounds of modern Edinburgh is unclear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello! 
I'm a 20 something guy desperately looking for a place by Christmas. A flat I had lined up fell through for various reasons so i'm crashing with my parents at the moment. This is,to put it bluntly, doing my nut in. So i'm looking for a place ASAP. I work full time in a high end cocktail bar in the city centre (my dream job) and have a love for cooking, books, films (especially Humphrey Bogart) and loads of other stuff. I enjoy hanging out with people but i am really not looking for a party flat of any kind, I've done that bit now and need somewhere a bit more chill. My budget all in is around 450 including bills and council tax etc. If anyone knows of a room going or is looking themselves - hit me up!

Cheers  </TEXT>

Everything's just a bit naff - no one really wants to be serenaded with dinner/drinks/boat trips... Why are they alway's singing?!? And badly I might add. Urgh Bruxism is rough at the best of times. My teeth are a horrible mess at the back from that a while ago. Big doggy licks are both a blessing and a curse. Which fun stuff you thinking of doing? The LDR is good actually, at least, easier than I thought it would be. It's only for a year, 2 months in already, although it does feel like a lot longer.

<TEXT> Sorry for the reminder of that awful song... What's everyone expecting this weekend?
This is my last weekend at the party bar I've been working at since February, starting at a craft cocktail bar on Wednesday for a complete change of scene and man am I looking forward to it! I've really enjoyed working at the party bar and it's taught me a hell of a lot but as they say, all good things must pass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last Tuesday. My capacity 64 bar was sitting on about 200 at 1am. It's the middle of the Edinburgh Festival so we have a 3am license because of it. To drum up some midweek trade we gave discount cards to all the bar staff in a 2 mile radius for 2 vodka mixers (all my absolut flavours) and 2.50 pints of Budweiser. It was quiet so I sent the new guy home around midnight - I was not expecting a rush at all. By 3am we had taken 1800 pound entirely from the discount cards. I plowed through 3 kegs of Budweiser and an unholy amount of vodka. Ran out of tequila, Jagermeister and sweat by the end of the night. Worst part? 5 total in tips AND THEY WERE ALL BARTENDERS!!! Bastards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey folks
Now I have an interview next week for an Assistant Managers job at an awesome bar/kitchen in Edinburgh  that I'm really hoping I get. They've asked me to come into the interview with ideas or filling their 150 capacity function room above the bar on every Saturday night. They already do live music and ceilidh's at the weekend but it's just not pulling the crowds in. It's a fairly high class venue (or at least wants to be) and I'm a little stumped. Any suggestions for events you can hold on a Saturday night?  I'm going into the interview saying they need to push their marketing as a first thing, cos there isn't any at the moment. Cheers folks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to a beer tasting last night put on by one of our suppliers and today I have become hangover, destroyer of souls. I'm talking 7th circle of hell hangover, hot and cold at the same time, smell of booze making me gag type stuff. To top it off I'm in the middle of a 13 hour single manned shift... Urgh. Any tips to help me through this awful awful turn of events? 

Edit: cheers for all the advice folks, I'm pulling through to the end now - Final hour, it's been tough but this hangovers arse is being kicked up and down the street by a combo of red bull, bitters, ginger ale and a shot of vodka in the red bull as well as a bit of old fashioned pulling myself up by my bootstraps. Couldn't have done it without you! Drinks on me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a bartender at the moment so probably not every day life but it's here anyway. Usually I'm asleep in the morning and waking up around 12pm. Once I'm awake I usually eat a small meal, most likely salad with a load of vegetables through it. Now it's about 2pm so I do a little bit of work for my job (I run their social media and graphic design stuff) at which point it's time to go to work. I start work at 4pm and work right through till 2am and with no shops open really when I finish work I tend to bring a sort of snack box with me to graze on throughout my shift. Usually some oatcakes, a bit of cheese, some tomatoes etc. when I leave my job I walk home which takes me about half an hour. I walk past the castle here every night which I think looks awesome when it's all lit up by big colourful lights. I usually get home just before 3am, have a meal of stew or pasta, sometimes chilli before crashing out and starting all over again. Hope that helps! </TEXT>

Every Saturday my Dad will sit and eat a bowl of soup and proclaim that he thought it was great and really enjoyed it. He told me in confidence about a year ago that he hates soup, always has done, and that it makes him feel sick. Yet he still eats it and has never told my Mum. I think that gives you a good idea of what my parents are like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The council is cracking down on the number of bins in the centre with a new pilot on rose street to start with that means that commercial bins are no longer allowed on the street, and rubbish can only be out at certain times of the day for pick up. The problem with this is that it's expensive as hell for small business and that the commercial bin company's are incredibly unreliable. For the bar I work in it means that we have to keep our rubbish on the premises over night and we are a tiny bar about 24ft by 20ft. This causes all kinds of hygiene issues with as far as we can tell, no real solution. Suggestions welcome! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The most interesting man I ever met whilst working was in the pub in Edinburgh I worked in for a bit. A guy called "Ronnie". "Ronnie" was one of our regulars, an older bloke who had done loads of stuff in his life. An ex-army boxer who served in Northern Ireland during the troubles and when he de-mobbed worked in a bar in London run by the Cray family. Whilst he was working for the Crays he dealt with guns pointed at him, cops harassing him etc even though all he genuinely didnt have any involvement with them criminally. After this he worked as a porter at the Ritz for a while and met all sorts of celebrities. Now here he is in Edinburgh sitting at the bar most days, and there wouldn't be a day that went by without someone coming in and having a heart to heart with him, he is a marriage counsellor, grief easer, story teller, advice giver and friend to many people from all over the world who whenever they are in town, will make the effort to come and see him. A properly stand up bloke. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Making cocktails - sure memorising a lot of drinks takes time, but when you come down to it most cocktails are just a formula. Sours are 2 strong one sweet one sour, doesn't matter what the strong, sweet, and sour actually are. Shake that with an egg white, put it in a tall glass and add soda and boom! You've got a fizz! People are very easily impressed by that and its not a difficult skill to learn. Actually using it to make money is a whole different ball game though - think cooking at home compared to working in a professional kitchen. </TEXT>

Some Guinness was spilt on the barroom floor 
When the pub was closed for the night 
Out of his hole crept a wee brown mouse 
and stood in the pale moonlight. 
He lapped up the frothy foam from the floor 
then back on his haunches he sat. 
All night long you could hear him roar, 
"Bring on the goddamn cat!" </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So there I am working away on Saturday night when a group of guys come in and start ordering jger-bombs, 10 at a time on top of all the pints/spirit+mixers etc. Within half an hour of them ordering maybe 40  jger-bombs in total (it was a group of probably 8-10) it becomes clear that two of them are well on there way to being drunk. My bar is pretty small so we have a strict door policy. One of my fellow bartenders explains to the group that they're going to have to leave, we apologise it's not my personal policy it's part of the licensing act etc etc. The group does not take this well and my colleague has to retreat behind the bar. So I go and speak to them to stop them yelling abuse at my colleague, I'm very much of the fight them with smiles school of cutting people off but even still initially there is one guy who is very very in my face, his mates actually pull him back at one point. Eventually though, through persistent smiles and apologies out of my control feel free to come back another time etc etc they agree to finish they're drinks and leave. An hour later I've managed to get outside for a cigarette, two guys who had been in earlier but had left whilst I was talking to the group approach me and tell me that they'd left because the guy who was all in my face had a blade and was about to use it which is why his mates pulled him back... So yeah nearly got stabbed. I'm just real glad I was nice to them, could have gone a lot worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few years ago as I was walking home from a night out I heard a lady yelling so, naturally, I went to investigate. A dude was wrestling with this blonde lady - a little way up the hill from where I was - trying to rip her dress off. "shit shit shit" goes my brain and split second decision of running up behind the guy yelling "OI!!" and as he turns flicking my lit cigarette in his eyes then slamming my elbow into his face. The guy falls over and smacks his head on the ground and is knocked out. I turn to the lady and ask if she's ok and then call the police. The police arrived rapidly to find me sitting on the dude, nattering away to the lass and then commend by stupidity/courage. Never felt quite so manly again.

Edit:punctuation 
Edit2: Gold! Thanks stranger, now I must find out what all the fuss is about! </TEXT>

Basically still struggling with the fact I'm not single anymore. Problem is (as a few of my female friends have said) I am VERY good at being a boyfriend and I sort of dive into that role really head on and now the Spanish lass is, as far as I can tell, falling in a big way for me.

<TITLE> Porter syrup uses? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-04 16:18:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently made a porter syrup (recipe below) and have been experimenting with it and I was wondering what you guys would use it for? It has a pleasant maltiness with a sweetness similar to maple syrup.

1 Bottle porter (I used Tap Out smoked porter)
Sugar

1)Bring to just below the boil then turn to a gentle simmer for 30-40 minutes until 1/3rd of the original volume.
2) at this point it helps to have scales, weigh the porter and add 3/4 of the weight in sugar (does that make sense?) and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
3) chill. TADA! Porter syrup. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As i said not a believer. When I worked there just after mopping the floor one evening after close, pouring the bucket down the toilet I hear "JOHNNYDONTDOIT COME INTO THE OFFICE!!!" thinking its my boss I run into the office. No one there. Just a little weirded out I leave the office and go into the cellar to put the bucket away, coming out the cellar it happens again so back into the office. Again no one there. When I go to push the door open I find its jammed, no biggy just give it a push. Nothing. Try again. Nothing. I end up having to slam my full weight against the door to open it which had never happened to me before or anyone since (as far as i'm aware). When I go upstairs my boss is standing with the one other member of bar staff and i instantly ask them whether they were messing with me. They say they hadn't been and with me more than a lot weirded out I make my boss show me the CCTV - neither of them had left the upstairs part of the bar for the 20 minutes over which this had happened. This was when they told me about the ghost. I still dont believe but they certainly did and I can see why - ask most of the long term staff there and they will have a story to tell, all with logical explanations but god damn a lot of weird shit has happened in that pub. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'm presuming you know how to make simple syrup ( if not heres a guide http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Simple-Syrup ) make that but add fresh grated ginger for the heating time and add 24 hours to infuse then strain.
Make it a double measure of cello (so 50ml if your British) and half a measure oo single of syrup in a collins glass then top with soda ( these measures are entirely dependent on how sweet you like your drink) cointreau goes down nicely with a single measure in this too. </TEXT>
