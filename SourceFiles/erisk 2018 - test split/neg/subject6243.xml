<TEXT> **Ingredients** 

Milk	400 ml 

Condensed Milk	300ml 

Corn Flour	3 tablespoons 

Mango	1 

Almonds	5-6 

ParleG biscuits  	5-6 

Cardamom	2 

**Steps** 

Dice the mangos into small pieces.

 Mix cold milk and corn flour till no lumps remain. 

Boil this with the condensed milk on medium flame stirring continuously. Add the mango and the seeds from the cardamom. 

Stir continuously on medium flame till it thickens. Put Parle-G in a Zip lock cover. 

Close it and use a rolling pin over it to crumble the biscuit. 

Line the bottoms of 5 dessert bowls with the Parle-G crumbs. 

Pour the thickened pudding over this. Grate almond on top of the pudding. 

Refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Serve cold.

**Note**: I used Parle G biscuits because they are the most common in India. You can use any plain biscuit or cookie like graham crackers.

<TEXT> **Ingredients** 

Whole wheat flour	3 cups 

Oil	1 tablespoon 

Sugar	1 teaspoon 

Salt	as required 

Hot water	as required 

***For stuffing*** 

Boiled and peeled Potato	1/2 cup 

Cooked Green peas	1/2 cup 

Garlic paste	1/4 teaspoon 

Finely chopped onion	2 tablespoons 

Chopped green chilies	1/2 teaspoon 

Turmeric powder	1/4 teaspoon 

Aamchur(dried Mango Powder)	1/4 teaspoon 

Salt	as required 

**Steps** 

Take the whole wheat flour in a wide bowl. Add the oil, sugar and salt. Pour hot water into this mix and knead till a smooth dough is formed. Be careful while pouring the water. 

Pour small quantities so you know you won't end up adding too much, making the dough sticky. 

Mash together, cooked green peas and boiled potatoes. Add the garlic paste, finely chopped onions, turmeric powder, aamchur and salt. Mix well. 

Take the dough and divide it into 12 equal sized balls. Roll out one of them, but make sure to not make this too thin. Keep aside. 

Roll out a second one in the same fashion. Take one roti. Place the aloo mattar mix and flatten on it . 

Place the second roti on top. press and seal the edges. 

Roll it out again fully. 

Heat a tawa/girdle. 

Place the rolled paratha on it and flip till both sides are cooked. Add some butter if you want and serve hot with some yoghurt and pickle. 

Repeat with the remaining dough.

**Note:** 
You can pick up all the spices in asian supermarkets. If you don't find Aamchur, that's fine. What it does it give a nice tangy flavour. Instead you can add some lemon juice to the mashed mixture.

<TITLE> Indian Chicken Curry Simmered In a Tea Sauce </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-30 10:36:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Ingredients** 

Curry Cut Chicken(Skinless pieces of whole chicken)	1 kg 

Onions (medium sized)	3 

Tomatoes (medium sized)	2 

Ginger paste	2 teaspoons 

Garlic paste	2 teaspoons 

Black tea	1/2 cup 

Oil	2 teaspoons 

Cloves	2-3 

Cinnamon	1 inch 

Fenugreek seeds	3-4 

Coriander powder	3 teaspoons 

Red chili powder	2 teaspoons 

Kasuri methi(Dried fenugreek leaves)	2 teaspoons 

Salt	as required 

***For Marinade*** 

Whey	 3 cups 

Red chili powder	2 teaspoons 

Turmeric powder	1 teaspoon 

Lemon juice	2 tablespoons 

Salt	as required 

***For garnish***

Oil	2 teaspoons 

Onion	1 

Sugar	1 teaspoon 

Salt	as required 

**Steps** 

1. Clean the chicken pieces thoroughly. Take all the ingredients of the marinade, mix it together and pour over the chicken. Rub it into the chicken pieces and refrigerate for 4 hours. For the people who are wondering what whey is, it's the water that collects on top of curd/yogurt. If you don't have whey, simply drain the youghurt into a mislin cloth and use the water that collects. 

2. Chop the onions and the tomatoes. 

3. Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a wok/kadhai. 

4. Fry the cloves, cinnamon and fenugreek till the aromas are released. Add the onions into this. Saute till they become transparent. 

5. Add the tomatoes. When the tomatoes are half cooked, add the ginger and garlic paste. allow to cook till the raw smell leaves. 

6. Add the dry spices and cook till the oil is released from them. 

7. Now add the chicken pieces along with the marinade, add the tea and kasuri methi, cook on low till the chicken pieces are done. 

8. The sauce will be a little thin at this point, but that's okay because it will thicken as the curry sits. 

9. Take a pan, heat oil. Add thinly sliced onions and saute on low flame. Then add the sugar and allow the onions to caramelise. 

10. Season with a little salt and top over the chicken curry. Serve hot with rice or flatbreads like  rotis, phulkas or kerala porottas. 

**Note:** 

All the spiced mentioned are available in most asian stores. I used a normal Indian tea. You can get excellent results with chai tea or masala tea also.

<TEXT> It's a sort of firmer cottage cheese. You can get it in pretty much every asian store. If you don't you can simply drain the cottage cheese using a muslin cloth and use that . And capsicum is green pepper here. You can use red too. It just gives  hit of extra flavour :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for this. What I'm thinking of here are specialised recipe ebooks with a little bit of narrative. In terms of design and layout, we have a professional designer, so that should not be an issue. So mailing lists are the biggest target group for conversion, huh. Would make sense because they would be the engaged readers who find value in the content. Thanks. This really helps!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Guys! I have some questions around ebooks, so hoping it's okay to post here. So I was wondering what kind of download rates one can expect for a paid ebook? ( Is there even a norm around this?) And what would be the better format? PDF? Epub? Just trying to understand the feasibility of an ebook as a monetisation model. Any suggestions/help is greatly appreciated :).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before I answer this, I just want to say upfront that I work with Cucumbertown, which is a food blogging platform. So this is what happens usually. People blog for some time, get a loyal following over that time with a combination of good content and promotion on social media and then they get out an ebook. this way they already have an engaged user base that hey can talk about the ebook. You should check out [this interview](https://magazine.cucumbertown.com/not-yet-3-months-in-and-already-3000-up-the-first-steps-of-monetising-your-food-blog-by-samantha-ebf02209a295) we had done sometime back, where the blogger talks about what she did with ebooks mainly as a way of passive income. In my opinion, it's best to do both. Blog and get an ebook out, because with ebooks, the competition is extremely high, and conversion could be low.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's one version. [Here's](http://stayhealthyandwell.com/fresh-vs-frozen-vs-canned-vegetables/) another. And some reports claim that  these nutrients are known to escape during the thawing process for frozen veggies. Vitamin C and the B vitamins suffer the biggest nutritional losses in frozen fruits and vegetables, according to a 2007 study in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture. Levels of polyphenoic substances, which act as antioxidants to protect your cells from damage, also are lower in frozen food than fresh. Other nutrients, such as fiber, minerals, proteins and fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, E and carotenoids retain their value in either frozen or canned fruits and vegetables.I'm not saying frozen vegetables are evil. But if you have the option of fresh, personally I would not go for frozen. Each to their own.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would be good with desserts. Pour it over some ice cream and add some fruits. Or use it in a cake, Or marinate some chicken in it and cook it in sweet and spicy devilled sauce. I tend to do that with the Jack Daniels Honey, which I can't drink too much of. But it's great for cooking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First thing, get everything fresh. Frozen veggies are not healthy and they kill the taste. You mentioned wanting to try intresting salads. You could incorporate some of your husband's root veggies in a nice salad. Roasted sweet potatoes are fantastic in salads.Try a grilled eggplant salad  with some baby spinach, pomegranate and a yoghurt dressing. Ricotta is great with spinach, you could incorporate that into a salad, or pasta.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what kind of curry you are looking for. If you are doing a spicy curry with chicken, I love [this one](http://jane.cucumbertown.com/kerala-style-pepper-chicken-nadan-kurumulaku-kozhi-recipe). Its got a great peppery flavour that's amazing with rice. If you are doing a milder curry like a Chicken Tikka Masala, try the Gordon Ramsay Butter Chicken recipe, it's pretty good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I tend to do is cook the chicken with a little of the sauce. Not marinate it. Cook it. About 2 tablespoons. And try this. Cook on high for the first minute, then reduce, cover and cook for the next five. Open up. See how well its done. Should be around 1/3rd cooked. Now add the rest of the sauce and cook. See how that goes. :)  </TEXT>

Garlic Paste1 tablespoon 

Bayleaves2 

Cinnamon Sticks2 

Cloves5-6 

Cardamoms2 

Peppercorns1 teaspoon 

Chopped Cashewnuts2 tablespoons 

Khus Khus or Poppy Seeds1 tablespoon

Salt to taste 

**STEPS**

 In a large pan or kadhai, heat a tablespoon of butter and two tablespoons oil.  

Add green chili, red chillies, ginger, garlic paste and whole spices. Saute for a minute or two and add cashew nuts, poppy seeds and tomatoes. Mix well. 

Cover and cook this for ten to fifteen minutes till the tomatoes start breaking down. 

Switch off the flame and set aside to cool. 

Once cool enough to handle, fish out as many whole spices as possible, and grind the mixture to a smooth paste. 

In the same pan or kadhai, heat the remaining butter and add the tomato paste. 

Add garam masala powder, chili powder, turmeric, ketchup, salt and sugar or jaggery (if using) along with 1/2 cup water. Bring this to a boil.  

Once the curry comes to a boil, simmer and cook for 30 minutes, till the oil separates slightly. In another pan, dry roast the kasuri methi and grind it to a fine powder. 

Mix kasuri methi and fresh cream in the curry and switch off the flame. Let the curry cool completely before dividing it into smaller portions and freezing it in ziplock packs.

<DATE> 2016-01-04 10:14:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> INGREDIENTS 

750 gms	Shelled and cleaned Prawns 

2 tbsps	Oil 

7-8	Curry Leaves 

1 large	Onion Chopped 

1/2 tsp	Turmeric 

2	Green chile 

2	Kokum pieces ( Optional) 

pinch of	Sugar 

to taste	Salt 

1 cup	 Fresh grated coconut 

2 tbsps	Coriander seeds 

1/2 tbsp	Cumin seeds 

4-5	Dry red red chillies 

4-5	Kashmiri red chillies 

5-6 pods	Garlic 

1/2 tbsp	Tamarind Pulp 

STEPS 

Clean prawns. Add little salt and turmeric. Mix well and keep aside. In a pan dry roast coriander seeds and Cumins seed till aromatic.  

In a blender add grated coconut, roasted Coriander, cumin, red chillies, garlic. Add enough water and make a very smooth paste. 

Heat a heavy bottom pan. Add 1 tbsp oil. Add prawns and Saute on high heat for not more than 3 minutes, stirring continuously.

Remove and keep aside. In the same pan add remaining oil. Add curry leaves. Add chopped onions. Saute till the onions are translucent and soft. 

 Add ground coconut paste and saute till the raw smell is gone. Add required amount of water to the pan. 

Season it with salt (Keep in mind that the prawn marination also had salt in it) and sugar .Bring the gravy to a boil. 

Once the gravy comes to a rolling boil add Kokum(If using) and sliced green chillies. Add sauteed prawns.  

Let it cook for about a minute or so. Switch of the gas.  


Note: 1.If you are using tamarind and Kokum both then adjust the quantities accordingly, as both contributes to the sourness. 2. The cooking time of prawn depends on its size,so judge it accordingly. Cooking prawns for too long results in rubbery prawns.

<DATE> 2015-10-22 08:49:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I wanted a recipe for eggless nutella cake without cocoa powder or cooking chocolate. So here goes.
     These are Ingredients to serve 5

    1 1/2 cups All Purpose Flour
    1 1/2 teaspoons Baking Powder
    1 teaspoon Vanilla Powder
    4  tablespoons Nutella 
    3/4 cup Sugar
    1 cup Water
    100 gm Butter
    1 teaspoon Lemon Juice
    For Frosting
    
    2 teaspoons Caster sugar
    3 tablespoons Nutella
    Steps
        Sift together the flour and baking powder and keep aside.
        In a vessel, mix the water (Cold) and sugar till it dissolves.
        Preheat the oven to 200C.
        To the dissolved sugar add the 100 gm melted butter. Mix thoroughly.
        Now add the juice of the lemon and mix together.
        Then add the Vanilla powder and mix again.

<TEXT> Medium is a great place to start blogging as it will help you focus on writing and creating great content. But your blog will not have an individual look and feel and if you are thinking of later building it into a monetizable blog, then Wordpress is a better option. But writing is super easy on Medium and everything look great with the least amount of effort.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely understand what you mean. First things first. What kind of blog are u thinking about? Is it along the lifestyle genres of travel, food etc which is design heavy? If it is design/ image oriented, I would strongly suggest you use Wordpress. And to begin with, use the free version. You can always migrate content if you decide to move to an individual domain. 

 nbsp;


The biggest issue with blogger is what you worry about, that it could pull the plug on you. It's happened to me because someone had raised a complaint and the person who had an issue had mistaken my blog for another or some such thing But having said that, you can also request for your blog to be reinstated, but it is rather tedious. now with Wordpress, even the free one
*You get access a lot of customisation options
*Far more themes available
* and contrary to popular opinion, very easy to use.

 nbsp;

But the negatives with the free version are that you can't do Adsense integration and you can't add a huge range of widgets and plugins (like SEO related stuff). But that's just content creation. You will have to also think about marketing and traffic building once you have a few posts up. All the best!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, a little background here. 
I am India, so is my boyfriend. I'm Hindu and he is Christian. In India this is almost like being different species when it comes to marriage.
He is my cousin's best mate. (that's how we met) After two years of dating (which is again super frowned upon on India) we decided to get married. And where we come from, it's still the parents that give the final nod to your partner (Weird, I know).
So we tell both our folks. And initially they seemed to take it well and agreed to meet. After the meeting, his folks insisted that I convert, and my folks are insistent that I do not. (personally too I don't want to  convert and neither does he) Now it's come to the point where his people are saying things like 'she is getting older'(i'm 27) and stuff and the parents are refusing to talk to each other. This lack of communication has been going on for about 7 months now. We are quite done with it. We have decided to do this on our own. So we need to know what things we will need to think of besides the obvious stuff. Guests, Legal stuff, Food, Clothes, Alcohol etc are the stuff we have started looking into so far. 

Update: They have finally agreed!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a few that fall under that category: 
A Few Good Men : About the subjectiveness of justice and obedience. Although Dawson and Downey are found not guilty, they are not blameless either. It was the first movie that made me think of the grey areas there.
Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind: for what we can with our choices.
The Prestige: about the lengths one can go to. And the essential grey of life.
Incendies: Disturbing.

<TEXT> One big advantage with Wordress is that it is more customisable. Not just with themes, but also the plugins and widgets and so on. Adsense is fairly easily integrated on Wordpress, easier still in my experience if you have a custom domain. But it totally depends on what you want to do with the blog. If it's a design heavy blog, I would suggest go with WP. Blogger has it's own advantages, it's fairly simple to use and easy to understand </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is definitely alot of money in blogging. Check this out to get some idea: 
http://pinchofyum.com/june-traffic-income-report

And as to resources, yes there are plenty of those.
The kissmetrics website has a lot of insights, Neil patels blog is another good source. 
But it is not easy. It's hard work and the competition is super high. And it would also depend on what kind of blogging you are doing. Now banner ads are bringing in very little money, so you have to depend more on sponsored posts, affiliate marketing etc. So definitely hard to make a living, but not impossible.  </TEXT>
