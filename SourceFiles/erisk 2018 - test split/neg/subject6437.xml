A multidisciplinary approach to designing and evaluating Electronic Medical Record portal messages that support patient self-care. 

Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 2017; 69: 63 

DOI: 10.1016/j.jbi.2017.03.015

Abstract:

 We describe a project intended to improve the use of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) patient portal information by older adults with diverse numeracy and literacy abilities, so that portals can better support patient-centered care. Patient portals are intended to bridge patients and providers by ensuring patients have continuous access to their health information and services. However, they are underutilized, especially by older adults with low health literacy, because they often function more as information repositories than as tools to engage patients. We outline an interdisciplinary approach to designing and evaluating portal-based messages that convey clinical test results so as to support patient-centered care. We first describe a theory-based framework for designing effective messages for patients. This involves analyzing shortcomings of the standard portal message format (presenting numerical test results with little context to guide comprehension) and developing verbally, graphically, video- and computer agent-based formats that enhance context. The framework encompasses theories from cognitive and behavioral science (health literacy, fuzzy trace memory, behavior change) as well as computational/engineering approaches (e.g., image and speech processing models). We then describe an approach to evaluating whether the formats improve comprehension of and responses to the messages about test results, focusing on our methods. The approach combines quantitative (e.g., response accuracy, Likert scale responses) and qualitative (interview) measures, as well as experimental and individual difference methods in order to investigate which formats are more effective, and whether some formats benefit some types of patients more than others. We also report the results of two pilot studies conducted as part of developing the message formats. </TEXT>

Timelines of translational science: From technology initiation to FDA approval

Laura M. McNamee, Michael Jay Walsh, Fred D. Ledley

PLoS ONE 12(5): e0177371. 

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0177371

Link: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177371

Abstract:

 While timelines for clinical development have been extensively studied, there is little data on the broader path from initiation of research on novel drug targets, to approval of drugs based on this research. We examined timelines of translational science for 138 drugs and biologicals approved by the FDA from 20102014 using an analytical model of technology maturation. Research on targets for 102 products exhibited a characteristic (S-curve) maturation pattern with exponential growth between statistically defined technology initiation and established points. The median initiation was 1974, with a median of 25 years to the established point, 28 years to first clinical trials, and 36 years to FDA approval. No products were approved before the established point, and development timelines were significantly longer when the clinical trials began before this point (11.5 vs 8.5 years, p0.0005). Technological maturation represents the longest stage of translation, and significantly impacts the efficiency of drug development. </TEXT>

Whose Job Will Be Taken Over by a Computer? The Role of Personality in Predicting Job Computerizability over the Lifespan. 

European Journal of Personality, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1002/per.2103

Link: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170509122024.htm

Abstract:

 Economists estimate that 47% of US jobs will be computerized in the future. This paper tests the prospective role of a comprehensive range personality factors on selection into more (or less) computerizable jobs. We used a US representative high school sample (N = 346 660) and a longitudinal design. At baseline, we measured social background, intelligence, personality traits and vocational interests. In two follow-ups (11 and 50 years later), we recorded occupations and coded their probability of being computerized based on the skills required and technological developments. Multiple regressions showed that, regardless of social background, people who were more intelligent, mature, interested in arts, and sciences at baseline, and selected into jobs that had a lower probability of computerization. On average, a one standard deviation increase in each of these traits predicted an average of 4 percentage points drop in the probability of one's job of being computerized. At the US population level, this is equivalent with saving 5.8 million people from losing their future careers to computerization. Most effects replicated across time. Path analyses showed that educational attainment mediated these effects and some direct effects remained. This highlights the importance of personality on occupational selection and in shaping the labour market. Copyright  2017 European Association of Personality Psychology </TEXT>

Inequalities in Life Expectancy Among US Counties, 1980 to 2014 Temporal Trends and Key Drivers. 

JAMA Internal Medicine, 2017 

DOI: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.0918

Full-text link: http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2626194

Abstract:

 Importance  Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic disparities over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity.

 Objective  To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.

 Design, Setting, and Participants  Annual county-level life tables were constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.

 Exposures  County of residence.

 Main Outcomes and Measures  Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk.

 Results  Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95% UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60%, 74%, and 27% of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74% of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors.

 Conclusions and Relevance  Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States. </TEXT>

Cell-specific pallidal intervention induces long-lasting motor recovery in dopamine-depleted mice

Kevin J Mastro, Kevin T Zitelli, Amanda M Willard, Kimberly H Leblanc, Alexxai V Kravitz   Aryn H Gittis

Nature Neuroscience (2017) 

doi:10.1038/nn.4559

Published online 08 May 2017

Link: https://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4559.html

Abstract:

 The identification of distinct cell types in the basal ganglia has been critical to our understanding of basal ganglia function and the treatment of neurological disorders. The external globus pallidus (GPe) is a key contributor to motor suppressing pathways in the basal ganglia, yet its neuronal heterogeneity has remained an untapped resource for therapeutic interventions. Here we demonstrate that optogenetic interventions that dissociate the activity of two neuronal populations in the GPe, elevating the activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GPe neurons over that of Lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6)-expressing GPe neurons, restores movement in dopamine-depleted mice and attenuates pathological activity of basal ganglia output neurons for hours beyond stimulation. These results establish the utility of cell-specific interventions in the GPe to target functionally distinct pathways, with the potential to induce long-lasting recovery of movement despite the continued absence of dopamine. </TEXT>

Abstract: 

 The balance between detrimental, pro-aging, often stochastic processes and counteracting homeostatic mechanisms largely determines the progression of aging. There is substantial evidence suggesting that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is part of the latter system because it modulates the physiological processes underlying aging1, 2. The activity of the ECS declines during aging, as CB1 receptor expression and coupling to G proteins are reduced in the brain tissues of older animals3, 4, 5 and the levels of the major endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are lower6. However, a direct link between endocannabinoid tone and aging symptoms has not been demonstrated. Here we show that a low dose of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) reversed the age-related decline in cognitive performance of mice aged 12 and 18 months. This behavioral effect was accompanied by enhanced expression of synaptic marker proteins and increased hippocampal spine density. THC treatment restored hippocampal gene transcription patterns such that the expression profiles of THC-treated mice aged 12 months closely resembled those of THC-free animals aged 2 months. The transcriptional effects of THC were critically dependent on glutamatergic CB1 receptors and histone acetylation, as their inhibition blocked the beneficial effects of THC. Thus, restoration of CB1 signaling in old individuals could be an effective strategy to treat age-related cognitive impairments. </TEXT>

Abstract

 Using data from 1,571 ninth-grade students (Mage = 14.62) from 82 academic track schools in Germany and their predominantly Caucasian middle-class parents, configurations of different family characteristics reported by parents were investigated. Latent profile analyses considering academic involvement, family interest, parents self-concept, child's need for support, and parents time and energy identified average, indifferent, motivated and engaged, motivated and disengaged, and involved families. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with students motivational (self-concept, effort, and interest) and achievement outcomes (achievement test and grades) in math were analyzed. Students from families classified as motivated and disengaged showed higher initial levels motivation and achievement. Over 5 months, these students also showed an increase in self-concept and higher achievement than students from other family types.

Retirement and Socioeconomic Differences in Diurnal Cortisol: Longitudinal Evidence From a Cohort of British Civil Servants 

Tarani Chandola  Patrick Rouxel  Michael G. Marmot  Meena Kumari

J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci gbx058. 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbx058

Published: 05 May 2017

Full-text link: https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/geronb/gbx058

Abstract:

 Objectives:

 Early old age and the period around retirement are associated with a widening in socioeconomic inequalities in health. There are few studies that address the stress-biological factors related to this widening. This study examined whether retirement is associated with more advantageous (steeper) diurnal cortisol profiles, and differences in this association by occupational grade.

 Method:

 Data from the 7th (20022004), 8th (2006), and 9th (200709) phases of the London-based Whitehall II civil servants study were analysed. Thousand hundred and forty three respondents who were employed at phase 8 (mean age 59.9 years) and who had salivary cortisol measured from five samples collected across the day at phases 7 and 9 were analysed.

 Results:

 Retirement was associated with steeper diurnal slopes compared to those who remained in work. Employees in the lowest grades had flatter diurnal cortisol slopes compared to those in the highest grades. Low-grade retirees in particular had flatter diurnal slopes compared to high-grade retirees.

 Discussion:

 Socioeconomic differences in a biomarker associated with stress increase, rather than decrease, around the retirement period. These biological differences associated with transitions into retirement for different occupational groups may partly explain the pattern of widening social inequalities in health in early old age. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi - I wouldn't say I'm "well-versed" - I don't do research in this area but try to be "well-read" if that makes sense. Overall, there hasn't been much progress beyond what is evidence-based treatment using minoxidil or finasteride. There is still little evidence for laser or stem cell treatments although active research still occurs. As someone else posted, any potential therapies in this space, like most cosmetic treatment, could be a potential goldmine if commercialised so the incentive is there. So to answer your question, I think we are still many years off from a "cure". Research like this looking at the genesis of baldness helps potential areas for therapies to target.  </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Hair differentiates from follicle stem cells through progenitor cells in the matrix. In contrast to stem cells in the bulge, the identities of the progenitors and the mechanisms by which they regulate hair shaft components are poorly understood. Hair is also pigmented by melanocytes in the follicle. However, the niche that regulates follicular melanocytes is not well characterized. Here, we report the identification of hair shaft progenitors in the matrix that are differentiated from follicular epithelial cells expressing transcription factor KROX20. Depletion of Krox20 lineage cells results in arrest of hair growth, confirming the critical role of KROX20+ cells as antecedents of structural cells found in hair. Expression of stem cell factor (SCF) by these cells is necessary for the maintenance of differentiated melanocytes and for hair pigmentation. Our findings reveal the identities of hair matrix progenitors that regulate hair growth and pigmentation, partly by creating an SCF-dependent niche for follicular melanocytes.

Safety Profile of Cough and Cold Medication Use in Pediatrics

Abstract:

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The safety of cough and cold medication (CCM) use in children has been questioned. We describe the safety profile of CCMs in children 12 years of age from a multisystem surveillance program.

 METHODS: Cases with adverse events (AEs) after ingestion of at least 1 index CCM ingredient (brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, guaifenesin, phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine) in children 12 years of age were collected from 5 data sources. An expert panel determined relatedness, dose, intent, and risk factors. Case characteristics and AEs are described.

 RESULTS: Of the 4202 cases reviewed, 3251 (77.4%) were determined to be at least potentially related to a CCM, with accidental unsupervised ingestions (67.1%) and medication errors (13.0%) the most common exposure types. Liquid (67.3%), pediatric (75.5%), and single-ingredient (77.5%) formulations were most commonly involved. AEs occurring in 20% of all cases included tachycardia, somnolence, hallucinations, ataxia, mydriasis, and agitation. Twenty cases (0.6%) resulted in death; most were in children 2 years of age (70.0%) and none involved a therapeutic dose. The overall reported AE rate was 0.573 cases per 1 million units (ie, tablets, gelatin capsules, or liquid equivalent) sold (95% confidence interval, 0.5530.593) or 1 case per 1.75 million units.

 CONCLUSIONS: The rate of AEs associated with CCMs in children was low. Fatalities occurred even less frequently. No fatality involved a therapeutic dose. Accidental unsupervised ingestions were the most common exposure types and single-ingredient, pediatric liquid formulations were the most commonly reported products. These characteristics present an opportunity for targeted prevention efforts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi - thanks for the tag. I usually post the exact title of an article and if it's not clear, add a direct quote from the article. However, the submission title can still be misleading in which case users can report the post for a Rule 11 violation or just PM me directly. I've removed my own posts in the past if my own quality control has been lacking. Or if reported in, another mod can provide a second independent opinion. 

In relation to the Elon Musk infinity warranty post of mine, I intentionally had the quote from him explaining why he thought they would last forever. Having said that, looking at the post history, no member has reported that post ever. If there was concern, people should report the post. I can tell you the mods definitely remove posts from other mods. 

Lastly, I apologise if my post misled. Let me know if it's a real issue I can delete it. Also I want to thank all of you members for your interest and for raising this as constructive feedback. It is important that as a community we work together to make this sub better for everyone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi

My intention is to share scientific news that relate to future medicine. It's not to, in your words, "get peoples [sic] hopes up with this trash man". 

From the actual university press release:

https://news.uthscsa.edu/ut-health-diabetes-breakthrough-increases-insulin-producing-cells/

 UT Health San Antonio researchers have a goal to reach human clinical trials in three years, but to do so they must first test the strategy in large-animal studies, which will cost an estimated $5 million.
 Those studies will precede application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Investigational New Drug (IND) approval, Bruno Doiron, Ph.D., a co-inventor, said.
 The scientists received a U.S. patent in January, and UT Health San Antonio is spinning out a company to begin commercialization.
 The strategy has cured diabetes in mice.
 It worked perfectly, Dr. Doiron, assistant professor of medicine at UT Health, said. We cured mice for one year without any side effects. Thats never been seen. But its a mouse model, so caution is needed. We want to bring this to large animals that are closer to humans in physiology of the endocrine system.

I don't know the institution or the researchers. The journal itself has an impact factor of 1.61 so that's low for a biomedical journal I agree. Gene transfer has been shown to be efficacious in other diseases so it's interesting and encouraging that scientists are trying it out with some success in animals. 

No one is saying we are there yet, but there is a reason why this has been posted in /r/futurology and not /r/science by me. It's at the very least research done by scientists from a university published in a peer-reviewed journal. I believe that makes it a bit better than just "trash" or pure speculation.  </TEXT>

Evaluation of phenotype stability and ecological risk of a genetically engineered alga in open pond production. 

Algal Research, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.algal.2017.04.006

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211926417300024?via%3Dihub

Abstract:

 Genetically engineered (GE) algae offer the promise of producing food, fuel, and other valuable products with reduced requirements for land and fresh water. While the gains in productivity measured in GE terrestrial crops are predicted to be mirrored in GE algae, the stability of phenotypes and ecological risks posed by GE algae in large-scale outdoor cultivation remain unknown. Here, we describe the first US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-sanctioned experiment aimed at understanding how GE algae perform in outdoor cultivation. Acutodesmus dimorphus was genetically engineered by the addition of two genes, one for enhanced fatty acid biosynthesis, and one for recombinant green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression; both the genes and their associated phenotypes were maintained during fifty days of outdoor cultivation. We also observed that while the GE algae dispersed from the cultivation ponds, colonization of the trap ponds by the GE strain declined rapidly with increasing distance from the source cultivation ponds. In contrast, many species of indigenous algae were found in every trap pond within a few days of starting the experiment. When inoculated in water from five local lakes, the GE algae's effect on biodiversity, species composition, and biomass of native algae was indiscernible from those of the wild-type (wt) progenitor algae, and neither the GE nor wt algae were able to outcompete native strains. We conclude that GE algae can be successfully cultivated outdoors while maintaining GE traits, and that for the specific GE algal strain tested here they did not outcompete or adversely impact native algae populations when grown in water taken from local lakes. This study provides an initial evaluation of GE algae in outdoor cultivation and a framework to evaluate GE algae risks associated with outdoor GE algae production. </TEXT>

Nociceptive brain activity as a measure of analgesic efficacy in infants

Caroline Hartley1, Eugene P. Duff2,*, Gabrielle Green1,*, Gabriela Schmidt Mellado1, Alan Worley3, Richard Rogers4 and Rebeccah Slater1,

Science Translational Medicine  03 May 2017: Vol. 9, Issue 388, eaah6122

DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aah6122

Link: http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/388/eaah6122

Abstract

 Pain in infants is undertreated and poorly understood, representing a major clinical problem. In part, this is due to our inability to objectively measure pain in nonverbal populations. We present and validate an electroencephalography-based measure of infant nociceptive brain activity that is evoked by acute noxious stimulation and is sensitive to analgesic modulation. This measure should be valuable both for mechanistic investigations and for testing analgesic efficacy in the infant population. </TEXT>

Food brand recognition and BMI in preschoolers. 

Appetite, 2017; 114: 329 

DOI: 10.1016/j.appet.2017.03.049

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666317305159?via%3Dihub

Abstract:

 Children's food brand recognition predicts health-related outcomes such as preference for obesogenic foods and increased risk for overweight. However, it is uncertain to what degree food brand recognition acts as a proxy for other factors such as parental education and income, child vocabulary, child age, child race/ethnicity, parent healthy eating guidance, child commercial TV viewing, and child dietary intake, all of which may influence or be influenced by food brand recognition. U.S. preschoolers (N = 247, average age 56 months) were measured for BMI and completed the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test plus recognition and recall measures for a selection of U.S. food brands. Parents completed measures of healthy eating guidance, child dietary intake, child commercial TV viewing, parent education, household income, parent BMI, and child age and race/ethnicity. Controlling these variables, child food brand recognition predicted higher child BMI percentile. Further, qualitative examination of children's incorrect answers to recall items demonstrated perceptual confusion between brand mascots and other fantasy characters to which children are exposed during the preschool years, extending theory on child consumer development. </TEXT>

The Whorfian Time Warp: Representing Duration Through the Language Hourglass. 

Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 2017

Abstract:

 How do humans construct their mental representations of the passage of time? The universalist account claims that abstract concepts like time are universal across humans. In contrast, the linguistic relativity hypothesis holds that speakers of different languages represent duration differently. The precise impact of language on duration representation is, however, unknown. Here, we show that language can have a powerful role in transforming humans psychophysical experience of time. Contrary to the universalist account, we found language-specific interference in a duration reproduction task, where stimulus duration conflicted with its physical growth. When reproducing duration, Swedish speakers were misled by stimulus length, and Spanish speakers were misled by stimulus size/quantity. These patterns conform to preferred expressions of duration magnitude in these languages (Swedish: long/short time; Spanish: much/small time). Critically, Spanish-Swedish bilinguals performing the task in both languages showed different interference depending on language context. Such shifting behavior within the same individual reveals hitherto undocumented levels of flexibility in time representation. Finally, contrary to the linguistic relativity hypothesis, language interference was confined to difficult discriminations (i.e., when stimuli varied only subtly in duration and growth), and was eliminated when linguistic cues were removed from the task. These results reveal the malleable nature of human time representation as part of a highly adaptive information processing system. </TEXT>

Changes in PerceptionAction Tuning Over Long Time Scales: How Children and Adults Perceive and Act on Dynamic Affordances When Crossing Roads.

Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1037/xhp0000378

Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/? fa=main.doiLanding doi=10.1037/xhp0000378

Abstract:

 This investigation examined developmental change in how children perceive and act on dynamic affordances when crossing roads on foot. Six- to 14-year-olds and adults crossed roads with continuous cross-traffic in a large-screen, immersive pedestrian simulator. We observed change both in childrens gap choices and in their ability to precisely synchronize their movement with the opening of a gap. Younger children were less discriminating than older children and adults, choosing fewer large gaps and more small gaps. Interestingly, 12-year-olds gap choices were significantly more conservative than those of 6-, 8-, 10-, and 14-year-olds, and adults. Timing of entry behind the lead vehicle in the gap (a key measure of movement coordination) improved steadily with development, reaching adultlike levels by age 14. Coupled with their poorer timing of entry, 6-, 8-, and 10-year-olds gap choices resulted in significantly less time to spare and more collisions than 14-year-olds and adults. Time to spare did not differ between 12-year-olds, 14-year-olds, and adults, indicating that 12-year-olds more conservative gap choices compensated for their poorer timing of entry. The findings show that childrens ability to perceive and act on dynamic affordances undergoes a prolonged period of development, and that older children appear to compensate for their poorer movement timing skills by adjusting their gap decisions to match their crossing actions. Implications for the development of perceptionaction tuning and road-crossing skills are discussed.

Women with symptoms of a urinary tract infection but a negative urine culture: PCR-based quantification of Escherichia coli suggests infection in most cases. 

Clinical Microbiology and Infection, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.04.004

Link: http://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(17)30209-4/fulltext

Abstract:

 Objectives

 Our objective was to examine whether or not women with symptoms of a urinary tract infection but with a negative culture (20%30%) do have an infection.

 Methods

 We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, on top of a standard culture, in urine samples from 220 women with dysuria and/or frequency and/or urgency and from 86 women without symptoms. For symptomatic women, qPCR was also carried out for four sexually transmitted agents.

 Results

 In the symptomatic group, 80.9% (178/220) of the urine cultures were positive for any uropathogen and 95.9% (211/220) were E. coli qPCR-positive. For the control group, cultures for E. coli and E. coli qPCR were positive in, respectively, 10.5% (9/86) and 11.6% (10/86). In the symptomatic group, qPCR yielded 19 positive samples for S. saprophyticus qPCR, one positive sample for Mycoplasma genitalium and one for Trichomonas vaginalis.

 Conclusions

 These findings suggest that almost all women with typical urinary complaints and a negative culture still have an infection with E. coli.

Performance of an Artificial Pancreas System for Young Children with Type 1 Diabetes. 

Diabetes Technology   Therapeutics, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1089/dia.2016.0424

Link: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/dia.2016.0424

Abstract

 Background: Young children 58 years old with type 1 diabetes (T1D) exhibit clear needs for improved glycemic control but may be limited in their ability to safely interact with an artificial pancreas system. Our goal was to evaluate the safety and performance of an artificial pancreas (AP) system among young children with T1D.

 Research Design and Methods: In a randomized, crossover trial, children with T1D age 58 years were enrolled to receive on separate study periods (in random order) either the UVa AP using the DiAs Control Platform software with child-resistant lock-out screens (followed as an out-patient admission) or their usual insulin pump+continuous glucose monitor (CGM) care at home. Hypoglycemic events and CGM tracings were compared between the two 68-h study periods. All analyses were adjusted for level of physical activity as tracked using Fitbit devices.

 Results: Twelve participants (median age 7 years, n=6 males) completed the trial. Compared to home care, the AP admission resulted in increased time with blood glucose (BG) 70180mg/dL (73% vs. 47%) and lower mean BG (152mg/dL vs. 190mg/dL), both P0.001 after adjustment for activity. Occurrence of hypoglycemia was similar between sessions without differences in time 70mg/dL (AP 1.1%1.1%; home 1.6%1.2%). There were no adverse events during the AP or home study periods.

 Conclusions: Use of an AP in young children was safe and resulted in improved mean BG without increased hypoglycemia. This suggests that AP use in young children is safe and improves overall diabetes control. </TEXT>

Abstract

 With the increasingly dominant role of smartphones in our lives, mobile health care systems integrating advanced point-of-care technologies to manage chronic diseases are gaining attention. Using a multidisciplinary design principle coupling electrical engineering, software development, and synthetic biology, we have engineered a technological infrastructure enabling the smartphone-assisted semiautomatic treatment of diabetes in mice. A custom-designed home server SmartController was programmed to process wireless signals, enabling a smartphone to regulate hormone production by optically engineered cells implanted in diabetic mice via a far-red light (FRL)responsive optogenetic interface. To develop this wireless controller network, we designed and implanted hydrogel capsules carrying both engineered cells and wirelessly powered FRL LEDs (light-emitting diodes). In vivo production of a short variant of human glucagon-like peptide 1 (shGLP-1) or mouse insulin by the engineered cells in the hydrogel could be remotely controlled by smartphone programs or a custom-engineered Bluetooth-active glucometer in a semiautomatic, glucose-dependent manner. By combining electronic devicegenerated digital signals with optogenetically engineered cells, this study provides a step toward translating cell-based therapies into the clinic. </TEXT>

BDNF Overexpression Prevents Cognitive Deficit Elicited by Adolescent Cannabis Exposure and Host Susceptibility Interaction. 

Human Molecular Genetics, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1093/hmg/ddx139

Link: https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddx139/3574683/BDNF-Overexpression-Prevents-Cognitive-Deficit?redirectedFrom=fulltext

Abstract

 Cannabis abuse in adolescence is associated with increased risk of psychotic disorders. -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) protein is a driver for major mental illness by influencing neurodevelopmental processes. Here, utilizing a unique mouse model based on host (DISC1) X environment (THC administration) interaction, we aimed at studying the pathobiological basis through which THC exposure elicits psychiatric manifestations. Wild-Type and dominant-negative-DISC1 (DN-DISC1) mice were injected with THC (10mg/kg) or vehicle for 10 days during mid-adolescence-equivalent period. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess exploratory activity (open field test, light-dark box test) and cognitive function (novel object recognition test). Electrophysiological effect of THC was evaluated using acute hippocampal slices, and hippocampal cannabinoid receptor type 1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels were measured. Our results indicate that THC exposure elicits deficits in exploratory activity and recognition memory, together with reduced short-term synaptic facilitation and loss of BDNF surge in the hippocampus of DN-DISC mice, but not in wild-type mice. Over-expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of THC-treated DN-DISC1 mice prevented the impairment in recognition memory. The results of this study imply that induction of BDNF following adolescence THC exposure may serve as a homeostatic response geared to maintain proper cognitive function against exogenous insult. The BDNF surge in response to THC is perturbed in the presence of mutant DISC1, suggesting DISC1 may be a useful probe to identify biological cascades involved in the neurochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral effects of cannabis related psychiatric manifestations. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Slack vs Discord mod chat channel - which do you prefer - POLL </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi fellow mods

We have now setup both a Slack and Discord mod chat channel, but we should really only need one.

Both have been integrated into Reddit - Slack has Google Calendar integration too, and I'm sure we can do the same with Discord.

Can you post as a comment whether you prefer Slack or Discord - just post the name (and if you want to, the reason for your preference). Once we know, we can shut one of them down and focus on the single channel.

UPDATE: Current tally:

Discord: 4
Slack: 4
Either: 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> In practice this is what I've been doing. So I'm happy with this. 

The only downside is we can't make this an explicit rule and we still need to maintain the strict rule. Otherwise people will still post duplicates hoping to gain traction. But mods can use judgment to apply this at their discretion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think to keep it simple, we keep the strict interpretation, otherwise people will keep posting duplicates hoping mods would miss it, and hoping it gets upvoted enough to survive. However, mods can choose on a case by case basis to keep a top post at their discretion. But it will be in exceptional circumstances and only for top posts.

<TEXT> Hi all

The University of Connecticut press release has a bit more information in simple language that might be helpful here:

http://today.uconn.edu/2017/04/chili-pepper-marijuana-calm-gut/

I avoided using it as my submission as it's a bit sensationalized and I linked to the journal article instead but the press release may help answer some questions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, the issue here is ACT-resistance and the fact that the leaves overcame this. There may be something else in the natural plants. 

From the linked university press release article:

 Weathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plants leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs. </TEXT>

 Rule 11 - Titles should accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission.

 Rule 12 - Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content.

 Hi - the title is misleading as the patients are not "virus-free" but the virus is suppressed - please check the original sources that explains this. The Daily Mail, which is a British tabloid, is not a good source. Also, you used a Google cache URL link for your submission instead of the direct link to the article.

Artemisia annua dried leaf tablets treated malaria resistant to ACT and i.v. artesunate: case reports. 

Phytomedicine, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.phymed.2017.04.006

Abstract

Background
Dried leaf Artemisia annua (DLA) has shown efficacy against Plasmodium sp. in rodent studies and in small clinical trials. Rodent malaria also showed resiliency against the evolution of artemisinin drug resistance.

Purpose
This is a case report of a last resort treatment of patients with severe malaria who were responding neither to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) nor i.v. artesunate.

Study Design
Of many patients treated with ACTs and i.v. artesunate during the 6 mon study period, 18 did not respond and were subsequently treated with DLA Artemisia annua.

Methods
Patients were given a dose of 0.5 g DLA per os, twice daily for 5d. Total adult delivered dose of artemisinin was 55 mg. Dose was reduced for body weight under 30 kg. Clinical symptoms, e.g. fever, coma etc., and parasite levels in thick blood smears were tracked. Patients were declared cured and released from hospital when parasites were microscopically undetectable and clinical symptoms fully subsided.

Results
All patients were previously treated with Coartem provided through Sant Rurale (SANRU) and following the regimen prescribed by WHO. Of 18 ACT-resistant severe malaria cases compassionately treated with DLA, all fully recovered. Of the 18, this report details two pediatric cases.

Conclusions
Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged. </TEXT>

 Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged.

EDIT:

For the commenters saying that this is not new because Artemisinin, the drug used in Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), is derived from Artemisia annua, the issue here is resistance to Artemisinin combination therapy, and the fact that the dried natural leaves of the Artemisia plant appear to have overcome this. 

This suggests that there may be something else in the natural leaves of the Artemisia plant that is more than just pure Artemisinin.

From the linked university press release article:

 Weathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plants leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs.

It's fascinating stuff.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi fellow mods

As discussed in the other thread by mind_bomber, the issue of a Slack team channel was suggested. 

I've created a Slack Team channel as a result.

Please PM me with your email and I'll send you an invite. You can create a spare email to do this. Looking forward to seeing you on slack soon.

UPDATE: I've also created a Shared Google Calendar that is integrated into the Slack Channel (new event and reminders will show up in Slack) - I will add you to it at the same time I add you to the shared channel.

UPDATE 2: I've managed to integrate Reddit to Slack - so new posts in /r/futurologymoderators and /r/futurologyappeals will send a notice to the Slack Channel too. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi sorry for the late response - been away with family over Easter.

Completely agree with mind_bomber and others who have posted about being more proactive in this sub.

A great example to follow is /r/science, where they literally have an AMA every weekday, which they curate closely. They also have a mission, which is to make science accessible to a global audience, which I believe they are doing well. 

We should have a similar vision and mission, and promote the idea of a future for all. 

Great ideas from lug and abrownn re AMAs and podcasts etc.

Also, we need a mod slack - the science and defaultmod ones are very active. I note the futurology and futurologymoderators slack team names are already taken.

Let's get moving everyone! :) </TEXT>

Optimizing network attacks by artificial bee colony
Manuel LozanoCarlos Garca-MartnezFrancisco J. RodrguezHumberto M. Trujillo

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025516312075?via%3Dihub

Abstract

 Over the past few years, the task of conceiving effective attacks to complex networks has arisen as an optimization problem. Attacks are modelled as the process of removing a number k of vertices, from the graph that represents the network, and the goal is to maximise or minimise the value of a predefined metric over the graph. In this work, we present an optimization problem that concerns the selection of nodes to be removed to minimise the maximum betweenness centrality value of the residual graph. This metric evaluates the participation of the nodes in the communications through the shortest paths of the network.

 To address the problem we propose an artificial bee colony algorithm, which is a swarm intelligence approach inspired in the foraging behaviour of honeybees. In this framework, bees produce new candidate solutions for the problem by exploring the vicinity of previous ones, called food sources. The proposed method exploits useful problem knowledge in this neighbourhood exploration by considering the partial destruction and heuristic reconstruction of selected solutions. The performance of the method, with respect to other models from the literature that can be adapted to face this problem, such as sequential centrality-based attacks, module-based attacks, a genetic algorithm, a simulated annealing approach, and a variable neighbourhood search, is empirically shown. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Objective:
 This study compared health care access, utilization, and functional indicators among adults with and without serious psychological distress (SPD) in the years surrounding implementation of the Patient Portable and Affordable Care Act (ACA).

 Methods:
 Adults ages 18 to 64 from the 20062014 National Health Interview Survey (N=207, 853) were examined on 11 access, utilization, and functional indicators: health insurance coverage (health coverage), insufficient money for medications, delay in health care (delay in care), insufficient money for health care, visiting a doctor ten or more times in the past 12 months, change in place of health care, change in place of health care due to insurance, limitations in ability to work, limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs), insufficient money for mental health care, and having seen a mental health care provider.

 Results:
 Multivariate models that were adjusted for health coverage and sociodemographic characteristics indicated that compared with adults without SPD, adults with SPD had greater odds of lacking money for medications (AOR=10.0) and health care (AOR=3.1), experiencing delays in care (AOR=2.7), visiting a doctor ten or more times in the past 12 months (AOR=3.2), changing usual place of health care (AOR=1.5), changing usual place of health care because of insurance (AOR=1.5), and experiencing limitations in ADLs (AOR=3.6) and ability to work (AOR=1.8). The proportions of adults with SPD who lacked health coverage and money to buy prescriptions increased during the study period. Although this trend reversed in 2014, the proportion with SPD experiencing barriers remained above 2006 levels.

 Conclusions:
 Health care patterns among adults with SPD require greater attention. </TEXT>

 Hi - can you repost this and actually add some more content to your self-post? So ask a question for the community to discuss, or put in some of your own thoughts - at the moment, posting a single quote is not really substantive enough as a stand alone submission.

<TEXT> Oops that's my fault as the OP for trusting the article text. The list was a direct cut and paste from the article itself. The actual article in the last paragraph had the 3 states repeated and all I did was cut and paste the list! Very sorry everybody!!! Mods, let me know if I should remove and repost. 

Although it raises the question for me - that leaves only 8 states. Where did the 11 come from then? It's looking more like the journalist made a mistake with his count. Should be 8 states, not 11.  </TEXT>

Negative-Mass Hydrodynamics in a Spin-Orbitcoupled Bose-Einstein Condensate

M.A. Khamehchi, Khalid Hossain, M.E. Mossman, Yongping Zhang, Th. Busch, Michael McNeil Forbes, and P. Engels

Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 155301  Published 10 April 2017

https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301

Abstract:

 A negative effective mass can be realized in quantum systems by engineering the dispersion relation. A powerful method is provided by spin-orbit coupling, which is currently at the center of intense research efforts. Here we measure an expanding spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate whose dispersion features a region of negative effective mass. We observe a range of dynamical phenomena, including the breaking of parity and of Galilean covariance, dynamical instabilities, and self-trapping. The experimental findings are reproduced by a single-band Gross-Pitaevskii simulation, demonstrating that the emerging featuresshock waves, soliton trains, self-trapping, etc.originate from a modified dispersion. Our work also sheds new light on related phenomena in optical lattices, where the underlying periodic structure often complicates their interpretation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi kerovon

I'm happy to have the post remain removed. Just to point out, the actual title itself is a straight cut and paste out of the news article which quotes the core findings of the researchers. 

The top comment in the thread needs to be kept in context. There was a whole section after it:

 This increase in maternal deaths among women aged 40 and older is implausibly high and rapid, and we believe it has much to do with problems related to how information is collected at the time of death and with an over-reporting of maternal deaths, said Marian MacDorman, a research professor at the MPRC and the studys lead investigator. 

 However, even if much of this increase is the result of over-reporting, the researchers core findings represent several reasons for concern: 

 The maternal death rate continues to increase in the United States;
 The U.S. maternal death rate is much higher than in other industrialized countries; and
 The United States lacks a reliable way to collect information about why this is happening and about which segments of the population are most vulnerable   

I copied word for word from the research's core findings which was why it was publishable in the first place, despite the data quality issues, which is not unusual for an administrative dataset which is hard to control for. 

Anyway having said all that the post can remain removed as I know there has been multiple reports on it.  </TEXT>

Trends in Maternal Mortality by Sociodemographic Characteristics and Cause of Death in 27 States and the District of Columbia.

MacDorman, Marian F. PhD; Declercq, Eugene PhD; Thoma, Marie E. PhD

Obstetrics   Gynecology: April 2017

doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000001968

Abstract:

 OBJECTIVE: To analyze recent trends in maternal mortality by sociodemographic characteristics and cause of death and to evaluate data quality.

 METHODS: This observational study compared data from 2008-2009 with 2013-2014 for 27 states and the District of Columbia that had comparable reporting of maternal mortality throughout the period. Maternal mortality rates were computed per 100,000 live births. Statistical significance of trends and differentials was evaluated using a two-proportion z-test.

 RESULTS: The study population included 1,687 maternal deaths and 7,369,966 live births. The maternal mortality rate increased by 23% from 20.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2008-2009 to 25.4 in 2013-2014. However, most of the increase was among women aged 40 years or older and for nonspecific causes of death. From 2008-2009 to 2013-2014, maternal mortality rates increased by 90% for women 40 years of age or older but did not increase significantly for women younger than 40 years. The maternal mortality rate for nonspecific causes of death increased by 48%; however, the rate for specific causes of death did not increase significantly between 2008-2009 (13.5) and 2013-2014 (15.0).

 CONCLUSION: Despite the United Nations Millennium Development Goal and a 44% decline in maternal mortality worldwide from 1990 to 2015, maternal mortality has not improved in the United States and appears to be increasing. Maternal mortality rates for women 40 years or older and for nonspecific causes of death were implausibly high and increased rapidly, suggesting possible overreporting of maternal deaths, which may be increasing over time. Efforts to improve reporting for the pregnancy checkbox and to modify coding procedures to place less reliance on the checkbox are essential to improving vital statistics maternal mortality data, the official data source for maternal mortality statistics used to monitor trends, identify at-risk populations, and evaluate the success of prevention efforts. </TEXT>

A synthetic AAV vector enables safe and efficient gene transfer to the mammalian inner ear. 

Nature Biotechnology, 2017; 35 (3): 280 

DOI: 10.1038/nbt.3781

Abstract:

 Efforts to develop gene therapies for hearing loss have been hampered by the lack of safe, efficient, and clinically relevant delivery modalities1, 2. Here we demonstrate the safety and efficiency of Anc80L65, a rationally designed synthetic vector3, for transgene delivery to the mouse cochlea. Ex vivo transduction of mouse organotypic explants identified Anc80L65 from a set of other adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors as a potent vector for the cochlear cell targets. Round window membrane injection resulted in highly efficient transduction of inner and outer hair cells in mice, a substantial improvement over conventional AAV vectors. Anc80L65 round window injection was well tolerated, as indicated by sensory cell function, hearing and vestibular function, and immunologic parameters. The ability of Anc80L65 to target outer hair cells at high rates, a requirement for restoration of complex auditory function, may enable future gene therapies for hearing and balance disorders. </TEXT>

Hospital Risk of Data Breaches. 

JAMA Internal Medicine, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.0336

Abstract:

 As the adoption of electronic record and health information technology rapidly expands, hospitals and other health providers increasingly suffer from data breaches.1 A data breach is an impermissible use or disclosure that compromises the security or privacy of the protected health information and is commonly caused by a malicious or criminal attack, system glitch, or human error.2,3 Policy makers, hospital administrators, and the public are highly interested in reducing the incidence of data breaches. In this retrospective data analysis, we use data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to examine what type of hospitals face a higher risk of data breaches. </TEXT>

Vestibular stimulation improves insight into illness in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. 

Psychiatry Research, 2017; 251: 333 

DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2017.02.020

Link: http://www.psy-journal.com/article/S0165-1781(16)31572-4/fulltext

Abstract:

 Impaired insight into illness (IMP-INS) is common among individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), contributing to medication nonadherence and poor clinical outcomes. Caloric vestibular simulation (CVS) is typically used to assess peripheral vestibular system function. Left cold CVS is also a transiently effective treatment for IMP-INS and hemineglect secondary to right brain hemisphere stroke, and possibly for IMP-INS and mood stabilization in patients with SSD. Participants with SSD and moderate-to-severe IMP-INS participated in an exploratory double blind, crossover, randomized controlled study of the effects of CVS on IMP-INS. Participants sequentially received all experimental conditionsleft cold (4C), right cold, and body temperature/sham CVSin a random order. Repeated measures ANOVA were performed to compare changes in IMP-INS, mood and positive symptom severity pre and 30min post CVS. A significant interaction was found between CVS condition, time, and body temperature nystagmus peak slow phase velocity (PSPV) for IMP-INS, indicating that single session left cold CVS transiently improved IMP-INS while right cold CVS may have worsened IMP-INS, particularly in participants with greater vestibular reactivity (i.e. higher PSPV) to body temperature CVS. The procedure's effectiveness is attributed to stimulation of underactive right hemisphere circuits via vestibular nuclei projections to the contralateral hemisphere. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Of all known cultured stem cell types, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) sit atop the landscape of developmental potency and are characterized by their ability to generate all cell types of an adult organism. However, PSCs show limited contribution to the extraembryonic placental tissues in vivo. Here, we show that a chemical cocktail enables the derivation of stem cells with unique functional and molecular features from mice and humans, designated as extended pluripotent stem (EPS) cells, which are capable of chimerizing both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Notably, a single mouse EPS cell shows widespread chimeric contribution to both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in vivo and permits generating single-EPS-cell-derived mice by tetraploid complementation. Furthermore, human EPS cells exhibit interspecies chimeric competency in mouse conceptuses. Our findings constitute a first step toward capturing pluripotent stem cells with extraembryonic developmental potentials in culture and open new avenues for basic and translational research. </TEXT>

Derivation of Pluripotent Stem Cells with In Vivo Embryonic and Extraembryonic Potency

Abstract:

 Of all known cultured stem cell types, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) sit atop the landscape of developmental potency and are characterized by their ability to generate all cell types of an adult organism. However, PSCs show limited contribution to the extraembryonic placental tissues in vivo. Here, we show that a chemical cocktail enables the derivation of stem cells with unique functional and molecular features from mice and humans, designated as extended pluripotent stem (EPS) cells, which are capable of chimerizing both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Notably, a single mouse EPS cell shows widespread chimeric contribution to both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in vivo and permits generating single-EPS-cell-derived mice by tetraploid complementation. Furthermore, human EPS cells exhibit interspecies chimeric competency in mouse conceptuses. Our findings constitute a first step toward capturing pluripotent stem cells with extraembryonic developmental potentials in culture and open new avenues for basic and translational research. </TEXT>

Abstract

 Background

 Early-life exposure to household pets has the capacity to reduce risk for overweight and allergic disease, especially following caesarean delivery. Since there is some evidence that pets also alter the gut microbial composition of infants, changes to the gut microbiome are putative pathways by which pet exposure can reduce these risks to health. To investigate the impact of pre- and postnatal pet exposure on infant gut microbiota following various birth scenarios, this study employed a large subsample of 746 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Study (CHILD) cohort, whose mothers were enrolled during pregnancy between 2009 and 2012. Participating mothers were asked to report on household pet ownership at recruitment during the second or third trimester and 3 months postpartum. Infant gut microbiota were profiled with 16S rRNA sequencing from faecal samples collected at the mean age of 3.3 months. Two categories of pet exposure (i) only during pregnancy and (ii) pre- and postnatally were compared to no pet exposure under different birth scenarios.

 Results

 Over half of studied infants were exposed to at least one furry pet in the prenatal and/or postnatal periods, of which 8% were exposed in pregnancy alone and 46.8% had exposure during both time periods. As a common effect in all birth scenarios, pre- and postnatal pet exposure enriched the abundance of Oscillospira and/or Ruminococcus (P0.05) with more than a twofold greater likelihood of high abundance. Among vaginally born infants with maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis exposure, Streptococcaceae were substantially and significantly reduced by pet exposure (P0.001, FDRp=0.03), reflecting an 80% decreased likelihood of high abundance (OR 0.20, 95%CI, 0.060.70) for pet exposure during pregnancy alone and a 69% reduced likelihood (OR 0.31, 95%CI, 0.160.58) for exposure in the pre- and postnatal time periods. All of these associations were independent of maternal asthma/allergy status, siblingship, breastfeeding exclusivity and other home characteristics.

 Conclusions

 The impact of pet ownership varies under different birth scenarios; however, in common, exposure to pets increased the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been negatively associated with childhood atopy and obesity. </TEXT>

Neurology, 2017; 10.1212/WNL.0000000000003841

Link: http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2017/03/24/WNL.0000000000003841

Abstract:

 Objective: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of telemedical concussion evaluations (teleconcussion) for real-time athletic sideline assessment of concussion, as such assessment may address the gap in access some populations of athletes have to providers with expertise in concussion evaluation.

 Methods: A cohort of 11 consecutive male collegiate football players with suspected concussion was assessed using Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), King-Devick test (K-D), and modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS). A remote neurologist assessed each athlete using a telemedicine robot with real-time, 2-way audiovisual capabilities, while a sideline provider performed a simultaneous face-to-face assessment. After the assessment, a remove-from-play (RFP) determination was made. The remote and the face-to-face providers were blinded to each others examination findings and RFP decision until the end of the assessment.

 Results: The teleconcussion and face-to-face SAC were in agreement 100% of the time (6/6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 54%100%). The mean (SD) difference between remote and sideline K-D times was 0.7 (1.4) seconds. Remote and sideline K-D times were within a 3-second difference 100% of the time (11/11; 95% CI 72%100%). Remote and sideline mBESS scores were within 3 points 100% of the time (6/6; 95% CI 54%100%). RFP decisions were in agreement 100% of the time (11/11; 95% CI 72%100%).

 Conclusions: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of teleconcussion for sideline concussion assessments. These data suggest a high level of agreement between remote and face-to-face providers with regard to examination findings and RFP determinations. </TEXT>

Emergency Department Triage of Traumatic Head Injury Using a Brain Electrical Activity Biomarker: A Multisite Prospective Observational Validation Trial.

DOI: 10.1111/acem.13175

Abstract:

 Objectives

 A brain electrical activity biomarker for identifying traumatic brain injury (TBI) in emergency department (ED) patients presenting with high Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) after sustaining a head injury has shown promise for objective, rapid triage. The main objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of an automated classification algorithm to determine the likelihood of being computed tomography (CT) positive, in high-functioning TBI patients in the acute state.

 Methods

 Adult patients admitted to the ED for evaluation within 72 hours of sustaining a closed head injury with GCS 12 to 15 were candidates for study. A total of 720 patients (1885 years) meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in this observational, prospective validation trial, at 11 U.S. EDs. GCS was 15 in 97%, with the first and third quartiles being 15 (interquartile range = 0) in the study population at the time of the evaluation. Standard clinical evaluations were conducted and 5 to 10 minutes of electroencephalogram (EEG) was acquired from frontal and frontaltemporal scalp locations. Using an a priori derived EEG-based classification algorithm developed on an independent population and applied to this validation population prospectively, the likelihood of each subject being CT+ was determined, and performance metrics were computed relative to adjudicated CT findings.

 Results

 Sensitivity of the binary classifier (likely CT+ or CT) was 92.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 87.8%95.5%) for detection of any intracranial injury visible on CT (CT+), with specificity of 51.6% (95% CI = 48.1%55.1%) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.0% (95% CI = 93.2%97.9%). Using ternary classification (likely CT+, equivocal, likely CT) demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to traumatic hematomas (1 mL of blood), 98.6% (95% CI = 92.6%100.0%), and NPV of 98.2% (95% CI = 95.5%99.5%).

 Conclusion

 Using an EEG-based biomarker high accuracy of predicting the likelihood of being CT+ was obtained, with high NPV and sensitivity to any traumatic bleeding and to hematomas. Specificity was significantly higher than standard CT decision rules. The short time to acquire results and the ease of use in the ED environment suggests that EEG-based classifier algorithms have potential to impact triage and clinical management of head-injured patients. </TEXT>

Tunable sieving of ions using graphene oxide membranes

Nature Nanotechnology (2017) 

doi:10.1038/nnano.2017.21

Published online 03 April 2017

Abstract:

 Graphene oxide membranes show exceptional molecular permeation properties, with promise for many applications1, 2, 3, 4, 5. However, their use in ion sieving and desalination technologies is limited by a permeation cutoff of 9 (ref. 4), which is larger than the diameters of hydrated ions of common salts4, 6. The cutoff is determined by the interlayer spacing (d) of 13.5, typical for graphene oxide laminates that swell in water2, 4. Achieving smaller d for the laminates immersed in water has proved to be a challenge. Here, we describe how to control d by physical confinement and achieve accurate and tunable ion sieving. Membranes with d from 9.8 to 6.4 are demonstrated, providing a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions. In this regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with energy barriers of 10100kJmol1 depending on d. Importantly, permeation rates decrease exponentially with decreasing sieve size but water transport is weakly affected (by a factor of 2). The latter is attributed to a low barrier for the entry of water molecules and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries. Building on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable method to obtain graphene-based membranes with limited swelling, which exhibit 97% rejection for NaCl. </TEXT>

Bioinspired fractal electrodes for solar energy storages

Litty V. Thekkekara   Min Gu

Abstract:

 Solar energy storage is an emerging technology which can promote the solar energy as the primary source of electricity. Recent development of laser scribed graphene electrodes exhibiting a high electrical conductivity have enabled a green technology platform for supercapacitor-based energy storage, resulting in cost-effective, environment-friendly features, and consequent readiness for on-chip integration. Due to the limitation of the ion-accessible active porous surface area, the energy densities of these supercapacitors are restricted below ~3103Whcm3. In this paper, we demonstrate a new design of biomimetic laser scribed graphene electrodes for solar energy storage, which embraces the structure of Fern leaves characterized by the geometric family of space filling curves of fractals. This new conceptual design removes the limit of the conventional planar supercapacitors by significantly increasing the ratio of active surface area to volume of the new electrodes and reducing the electrolyte ionic path. The attained energy density is thus significantly increased to ~101Whcm3- more than 30 times higher than that achievable by the planar electrodes with ~95% coulombic efficiency of the solar energy storage. The energy storages with these novel electrodes open the prospects of efficient self-powered and solar-powered wearable, flexible and portable applications. </TEXT>

Chained Iron Microparticles for Directionally Controlled Actuation of Soft Robots

Marissa M. Schmauch, Sumeet R. Mishra, Benjamin A. Evans||, Orlin D. Velev and Joseph B. Tracy*

ACS Applied Materials   Interfaces

Publication Date (Web): March 28, 2017

Abstract:

 Magnetic field-directed self-assembly of magnetic particles in chains is useful for developing directionally responsive materials for applications in soft robotics. Using materials with greater complexity allows advanced functions, while still using simple device architectures. Elastomer films containing chained magnetic microparticles were prepared through solvent casting and formed into magnetically actuated lifters, accordions, valves, and pumps. Chaining both enhances actuation and imparts a directional response. Cantilevers used as lifters were able to lift up to 50 times the mass of the polymer film. We introduce the specific torque, the torque per field per mass of magnetic particles, as a figure of merit for assessing and comparing the performance of lifters and related devices. Devices in this work generated specific torques of 68 Nm/kgT, which is significantly higher than in previously reported actuators. Applying magnetic fields to folded accordion structures caused extension and compression, depending on the accordions orientation. In peristaltic pumps comprised of composite tubes containing embedded chains, magnetic fields caused a section of the tube to pinch closed where the field was applied. These results will facilitate both the further development of soft robots based on chained magnetic particles and efforts to engineer materials with higher specific torque. </TEXT>

Exposure to dairy manure leads to greater antibiotic resistance and increased mass-specific respiration in soil microbial communities

Carl Wepking, Bethany Avera, Brian Badgley, John E. Barrett, Josh Franklin, Katharine F. Knowlton, Partha P. Ray, Crystal Smitherman, Michael S. Strickland

Published 29 March 2017.

Abstract

 Intensifying livestock production to meet the demands of a growing global population coincides with increases in both the administration of veterinary antibiotics and manure inputs to soils. These trends have the potential to increase antibiotic resistance in soil microbial communities. The effect of maintaining increased antibiotic resistance on soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they regulate is unknown. We compare soil microbial communities from paired reference and dairy manure-exposed sites across the USA. Given that manure exposure has been shown to elicit increased antibiotic resistance in soil microbial communities, we expect that manure-exposed sites will exhibit (i) compositionally different soil microbial communities, with shifts toward taxa known to exhibit resistance; (ii) greater abundance of antibiotic resistance genes; and (iii) corresponding maintenance of antibiotic resistance would lead to decreased microbial efficiency. We found that bacterial and fungal communities differed between reference and manure-exposed sites. Additionally, the -lactam resistance gene ampC was 5.2-fold greater under manure exposure, potentially due to the use of cephalosporin antibiotics in dairy herds. Finally, ampC abundance was positively correlated with indicators of microbial stress, and microbial mass-specific respiration, which increased 2.1-fold under manure exposure. These findings demonstrate that the maintenance of antibiotic resistance associated with manure inputs alters soil microbial communities and ecosystem function. </TEXT>

Recent retreat of Columbia Glacier, Alaska: Millennial context

Geology 

First published online March 2017

doi: 10.1130/G38479.1

Abstract

 Columbia Glacier in Prince William Sound, Alaska, has retreated 20 km in the past three decades. We use marine sediment records to document the Columbia Glacier advance and retreat history over the past 1.6 k.y. in an effort to place its recent retreat in the context of the Common Era (C.E.). A change in magnetic mineralogy coincided with a shift in sediment geochemistry ca. 0.9 ka. This provenance change documents the advance of Columbia Glacier across a fault, resulting in glacial erosion of mafic rocks near the coast; this agrees with the timing of ice advance reconstructed using dendrochronology. Our marine provenance records show that Columbia Glacier remained advanced south of this fault into the 21st century. Columbia Glacier has now retreated north of this fault, making its recent retreat unprecedented since before ca. 0.9 ka. Southern Alaska temperatures have now warmed to pre0.9 ka levels, based on tree-ring and reanalysis data. We show with glacier model simulations that the warming between C.E. 1910 and 1980, that includes anthropogenic forcing, was sufficient to trigger the recent retreat of Columbia Glacier from its extended position of the past 0.9 k.y., consistent with our data-driven assessment of the relationship between regional climate change and glacier extent. We conclude that the recent retreat of Columbia Glacier is a response to climate change rather than part of a natural internal tidewater-glacier oscillation.

Abstract

 Slow, controlled breathing has been used for centuries to promote mental calming, and it is used clinically to suppress excessive arousal such as panic attacks. However, the physiological and neural basis of the relationship between breathing and higher-order brain activity is unknown. We found a neuronal subpopulation in the mouse preBtzinger complex (preBtC), the primary breathing rhythm generator, which regulates the balance between calm and arousal behaviors. Conditional, bilateral genetic ablation of the ~175 Cdh9/Dbx1 double-positive preBtC neurons in adult mice left breathing intact but increased calm behaviors and decreased time in aroused states. These neurons project to, synapse on, and positively regulate noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, a brain center implicated in attention, arousal, and panic that projects throughout the brain. </TEXT>

Large-scale design of robust genetic circuits with multiple inputs and outputs for mammalian cells

Benjamin H Weinberg,	N T Hang Pham,	Leidy D Caraballo,	Thomas Lozanoski,	Adrien Engel, Swapnil Bhatia	  Wilson W Wong

Nature Biotechnology (2017) 

doi:10.1038/nbt.3805

Abstract:

 Engineered genetic circuits for mammalian cells often require extensive fine-tuning to perform as intended. We present a robust, general, scalable system, called 'Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision' (BLADE), to engineer genetic circuits with multiple inputs and outputs in mammalian cells with minimal optimization. The reliability of BLADE arises from its reliance on recombinases under the control of a single promoter, which integrates circuit signals on a single transcriptional layer. We used BLADE to build 113 circuits in human embryonic kidney and Jurkat T cells and devised a quantitative, vector-proximity metric to evaluate their performance. Of 113 circuits analyzed, 109 functioned (96.5%) as intended without optimization. The circuits, which are available through Addgene, include a 3-input, two-output full adder; a 6-input, one-output Boolean logic look-up table; circuits with small-molecule-inducible control; and circuits that incorporate CRISPRCas9 to regulate endogenous genes. BLADE enables execution of sophisticated cellular computation in mammalian cells, with applications in cell and tissue engineering. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Obesity-associated insulin resistance plays a central role in type 2 diabetes. As such, tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate the insulin receptor (IR) are potential therapeutic targets. The low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP) is a proposed IR phosphatase, yet its role in insulin signaling in vivo has not been defined. Here we show that global and liver-specific LMPTP deletion protects mice from high-fat diet-induced diabetes without affecting body weight. To examine the role of the catalytic activity of LMPTP, we developed a small-molecule inhibitor with a novel uncompetitive mechanism, a unique binding site at the opening of the catalytic pocket, and an exquisite selectivity over other phosphatases. This inhibitor is orally bioavailable, and it increases liver IR phosphorylation in vivo and reverses high-fat diet-induced diabetes. Our findings suggest that LMPTP is a key promoter of insulin resistance and that LMPTP inhibitors would be beneficial for treating type 2 diabetes. </TEXT>

Selective Entrainment of Theta Oscillations in the Dorsal Stream Causally Enhances Auditory Working Memory Performance. 

Neuron, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.015

Link:
http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30198-8

Highlights

Dorsal auditory stream supports auditory working memory manipulation
Theta power and phase locking in the dorsal stream predict manipulation abilities
Rhythmic TMS over the IPS selectively entrains ongoing theta oscillations
TMS-induced behavioral enhancement is causally related to theta entrainment

Summary

 The implication of the dorsal stream in manipulating auditory information in working memory has been recently established. However, the oscillatory dynamics within this network and its causal relationship with behavior remain undefined. Using simultaneous MEG/EEG, we show that theta oscillations in the dorsal stream predict participants manipulation abilities during memory retention in a task requiring the comparison of two patterns differing in temporal order. We investigated the causal relationship between brain oscillations and behavior by applying theta-rhythmic TMS combined with EEG over the MEG-identified target (left intraparietal sulcus) during the silent interval between the two stimuli. Rhythmic TMS entrained theta oscillation and boosted participants accuracy. TMS-induced oscillatory entrainment scaled with behavioral enhancement, and both gains varied with participants baseline abilities. These effects were not seen for a melody-comparison control task and were not observed for arrhythmic TMS. These data establish theta activity in the dorsal stream as causally related to memory manipulation. </TEXT>

Breastfeeding, Cognitive and Noncognitive Development in Early Childhood: A Population Study

Lisa-Christine Girard, Orla Doyle, Richard E. Tremblay

Pediatrics Mar 2017, e20161848; 

DOI: 10.1542/peds.2016-1848

Abstract

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is mixed evidence from correlational studies that breastfeeding impacts childrens development. Propensity score matching with large samples can be an effective tool to remove potential bias from observed confounders in correlational studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of breastfeeding on childrens cognitive and noncognitive development at 3 and 5 years of age.

 METHODS: Participants included 8000 families from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal infant cohort, who were identified from the Child Benefit Register and randomly selected to participate. Parent and teacher reports and standardized assessments were used to collect information on childrens problem behaviors, expressive vocabulary, and cognitive abilities at age 3 and 5 years. Breastfeeding information was collected via maternal report. Propensity score matching was used to compare the average treatment effects on those who were breastfed.

 RESULTS: Before matching, breastfeeding was associated with better development on almost every outcome. After matching and adjustment for multiple testing, only 1 of the 13 outcomes remained statistically significant: childrens hyperactivity (difference score, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.33 to 0.35) at age 3 years for children who were breastfed for at least 6 months. No statistically significant differences were observed postmatching on any outcome at age 5 years.

 CONCLUSIONS: Although 1 positive benefit of breastfeeding was found by using propensity score matching, the effect size was modest in practical terms. No support was found for statistically significant gains at age 5 years, suggesting that the earlier observed benefit from breastfeeding may not be maintained once children enter school. </TEXT>

 Hi mate, I know you posted this around 2 days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/617w56/millions_of_uk_workers_at_risk_of_being_replaced/

Wait another day, and then repost this - to be fair to the other posters whose posts we have been removing as duplicates - because this latest post is really about the same topic actually.

 We go to a place at night and get set up, put up lights, collect on the trails, in the trees and plants, until two or three in the morning, he said. And then we crash and get up at nine in the morning and keep going. Its something we love to do.

A roadmap for rapid decarbonization

Johan Rockstrm1, Owen Gaffney1,2, Joeri Rogelj3,4, Malte Meinshausen5,6, Nebojsa Nakicenovic4, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber1,5

Science  24 Mar 2017: Vol. 355, Issue 6331, pp. 1269-1271

DOI: 10.1126/science.aah3443

Link: 
http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1269

Summary:

 Although the Paris Agreement's goals (1) are aligned with science (2) and can, in principle, be technically and economically achieved (3), alarming inconsistencies remain between science-based targets and national commitments. Despite progress during the 2016 Marrakech climate negotiations, long-term goals can be trumped by political short-termism. Following the Agreement, which became international law earlier than expected, several countries published mid-century decarbonization strategies, with more due soon. Model-based decarbonization assessments (4) and scenarios often struggle to capture transformative change and the dynamics associated with it: disruption, innovation, and nonlinear change in human behavior. For example, in just 2 years, China's coal use swung from 3.7% growth in 2013 to a decline of 3.7% in 2015 (5). To harness these dynamics and to calibrate for short-term realpolitik, we propose framing the decarbonization challenge in terms of a global decadal roadmap based on a simple heuristica carbon lawof halving gross anthropogenic carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions every decade. Complemented by immediately instigated, scalable carbon removal and efforts to ramp down land-use CO2 emissions, this can lead to net-zero emissions around mid-century, a path necessary to limit warming to well below 2C. </TEXT>

Summary:

 Although the Paris Agreement's goals (1) are aligned with science (2) and can, in principle, be technically and economically achieved (3), alarming inconsistencies remain between science-based targets and national commitments. Despite progress during the 2016 Marrakech climate negotiations, long-term goals can be trumped by political short-termism. Following the Agreement, which became international law earlier than expected, several countries published mid-century decarbonization strategies, with more due soon. Model-based decarbonization assessments (4) and scenarios often struggle to capture transformative change and the dynamics associated with it: disruption, innovation, and nonlinear change in human behavior. For example, in just 2 years, China's coal use swung from 3.7% growth in 2013 to a decline of 3.7% in 2015 (5). To harness these dynamics and to calibrate for short-term realpolitik, we propose framing the decarbonization challenge in terms of a global decadal roadmap based on a simple heuristica carbon lawof halving gross anthropogenic carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions every decade. Complemented by immediately instigated, scalable carbon removal and efforts to ramp down land-use CO2 emissions, this can lead to net-zero emissions around mid-century, a path necessary to limit warming to well below 2C. </TEXT>

A conserved NAD+ binding pocket that regulates protein-protein interactions during aging

Abstract

 DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains (NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD+ (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding of NAD+ to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphateribose) polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD+ concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD+. Thus, NAD+ directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 BACKGROUND

 Each year, rotavirus gastroenteritis is responsible for about 37% of deaths from diarrhea among children younger than 5 years of age worldwide, with a disproportionate effect in sub-Saharan Africa.

 METHODS

 We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Niger to evaluate the efficacy of a live, oral bovine rotavirus pentavalent vaccine (BRV-PV, Serum Institute of India) to prevent severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. Healthy infants received three doses of the vaccine or placebo at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Episodes of gastroenteritis were assessed through active and passive surveillance and were graded on the basis of the score on the Vesikari scale (which ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating more severe disease). The primary end point was the efficacy of three doses of vaccine as compared with placebo against a first episode of laboratory-confirmed severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (Vesikari score, 11) beginning 28 days after dose 3.

 RESULTS

 Among the 3508 infants who were included in the per-protocol efficacy analysis, there were 31 cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in the vaccine group and 87 cases in the placebo group (2.14 and 6.44 cases per 100 person-years, respectively), for a vaccine efficacy of 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.9 to 77.9). Similar efficacy was seen in the intention-to-treat analyses, which showed a vaccine efficacy of 69.1% (95% CI, 55.0 to 78.7). There was no significant between-group difference in the risk of adverse events, which were reported in 68.7% of the infants in the vaccine group and in 67.2% of those in the placebo group, or in the risk of serious adverse events (in 8.3% in the vaccine group and in 9.1% in the placebo group); there were 27 deaths in the vaccine group and 22 in the placebo group. None of the infants had confirmed intussusception.

 CONCLUSIONS

 Three doses of BRV-PV, an oral rotavirus vaccine, had an efficacy of 66.7% against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis among infants in Niger. (Funded by Mdecins sans Frontires Operational Center and the Kavli Foundation; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02145000.) </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Objectives To investigate the association between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease at higher resolution by examining the initial lifetime presentation of 12 cardiac, cerebrovascular, abdominal, or peripheral vascular diseases among five categories of consumption.

 Design Population based cohort study of linked electronic health records covering primary care, hospital admissions, and mortality in 1997-2010 (median follow-up six years).

 Setting CALIBER (ClinicAl research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records).

 Participants 1937360 adults (51% women), aged 30 who were free from cardiovascular disease at baseline.

 Main outcome measures 12 common symptomatic manifestations of cardiovascular disease, including chronic stable angina, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, unheralded coronary heart disease death, heart failure, sudden coronary death/cardiac arrest, transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.

 Results 114859 individuals received an incident cardiovascular diagnosis during follow-up. Non-drinking was associated with an increased risk of unstable angina (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.45), myocardial infarction (1.32, 1.24 to1.41), unheralded coronary death (1.56, 1.38 to 1.76), heart failure (1.24, 1.11 to 1.38), ischaemic stroke (1.12, 1.01 to 1.24), peripheral arterial disease (1.22, 1.13 to 1.32), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (1.32, 1.17 to 1.49) compared with moderate drinking (consumption within contemporaneous UK weekly/daily guidelines of 21/3 and 14/2 units for men and women, respectively). Heavy drinking (exceeding guidelines) conferred an increased risk of presenting with unheralded coronary death (1.21, 1.08 to 1.35), heart failure (1.22, 1.08 to 1.37), cardiac arrest (1.50, 1.26 to 1.77), transient ischaemic attack (1.11, 1.02 to 1.37), ischaemic stroke (1.33, 1.09 to 1.63), intracerebral haemorrhage (1.37, 1.16 to 1.62), and peripheral arterial disease (1.35; 1.23 to 1.48), but a lower risk of myocardial infarction (0.88, 0.79 to 1.00) or stable angina (0.93, 0.86 to 1.00).

 Conclusions Heterogeneous associations exist between level of alcohol consumption and the initial presentation of cardiovascular diseases. This has implications for counselling patients, public health communication, and clinical research, suggesting a more nuanced approach to the role of alcohol in prevention of cardiovascular disease is necessary. </TEXT>

Association Between Direct-to-Consumer Advertising and Testosterone Testing and Initiation in the United States, 2009-2013

J. Bradley Layton, PhD1; Yoonsang Kim, MPH, PhD2; G. Caleb Alexander, MD, MS3,4; et al Sherry L. Emery, MBA, PhD2

Abstract:

 Importance  Testosterone initiation increased substantially in the United States from 2000 to 2013, especially among men without clear indications. Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) also increased during this time.

 Objective  To investigate associations between televised DTCA and testosterone testing and initiation in the United States.

 Design, Setting, and Population  Ecologic study conducted in designated market areas (DMAs) in the United States. Monthly testosterone advertising ratings were linked to DMA-level testosterone use data from 2009-2013 derived from commercial insurance claims. Associations between DTCA and testosterone testing, initiation, and initiation without recent baseline tests were estimated using Poisson generalized estimating equations.

 Exposures  Monthly Nielsen ratings for testosterone DTCA in the 75 largest DMAs.

 Main Outcomes and Measures  (1) Rates of new serum testosterone testing; (2) rates of testosterone initiation (in-office injection, surgical implant, or pharmacy dispensing) for all testosterone products combined and for specific brands; and (3) rates of testosterone initiation without recent serum testosterone testing.

 Results  Of 17228599 commercially insured men in the 75 DMAs, 1007990 (mean age, 49.6 [SD, 11.5] years) had new serum testosterone tests and 283317 (mean age, 51.8 [SD, 11.3] years) initiated testosterone treatment. Advertising intensity varied by geographic region and time, with the highest intensity seen in the southeastern United States and with months ranging from no ad exposures to a mean of 13.6 exposures per household. Nonbranded advertisements were common prior to 2012, with branded advertisements becoming more common during and after 2012. Each household advertisement exposure was associated with a monthly increase in rates of new testosterone testing (rate ratio [RR], 1.006; 95% CI, 1.004-1.008), initiation (RR, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.004-1.010), and initiation without a recent test (RR, 1.008; 95% CI, 1.002-1.013). Mean absolute rate increases were 0.14 tests (95% CI, 0.09-0.19), 0.05 new initiations (95% CI, 0.03-0.08), and 0.02 initiations without a recent test (95% CI, 0.01-0.03) per 10000 men for each monthly ad exposure over the entire period.

 Conclusions and Relevance  Among US men residing in the 75 designated market areas, regional exposure to televised direct-to-consumer advertising was associated with greater testosterone testing, new initiation, and initiation without recent testing. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Platelets are critical for haemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory responses1, 2, but the events that lead to mature platelet production remain incompletely understood3. The bone marrow has been proposed to be a major site of platelet production, although there is indirect evidence that the lungs might also contribute to platelet biogenesis4, 5, 6, 7. Here, by directly imaging the lung microcirculation in mice8, we show that a large number of megakaryocytes circulate through the lungs, where they dynamically release platelets. Megakaryocytes that release platelets in the lungs originate from extrapulmonary sites such as the bone marrow; we observed large megakaryocytes migrating out of the bone marrow space. The contribution of the lungs to platelet biogenesis is substantial, accounting for approximately 50% of total platelet production or 10 million platelets per hour. Furthermore, we identified populations of mature and immature megakaryocytes along with haematopoietic progenitors in the extravascular spaces of the lungs. Under conditions of thrombocytopenia and relative stem cell deficiency in the bone marrow9, these progenitors can migrate out of the lungs, repopulate the bone marrow, completely reconstitute blood platelet counts, and contribute to multiple haematopoietic lineages. These results identify the lungs as a primary site of terminal platelet production and an organ with considerable haematopoietic potential.

<TEXT> Hi Professor Dumyati and Dr Dobson - thank you for spending time with us to carry out this AMA.

I applaud your efforts in reducing antibiotic use in primary care and other health settings. But unfortunately, there is a lack of control of such antibiotic usage in many third world countries where antibiotics can be bought over the counter. In addition, there is still rampant antibiotic use in livestock and farming around the world, contributing to the development of resistance. 

What's your view on how these issues should be tackled?

In relation to new and emerging therapeutics, what's on the horizon from your point of view, that is most promising?

Lastly, are we really going to be faced with a post-apocalyptic future of people dying from sore throats and superficial cuts because nothing works in the future (okay, I'm sensationalising now, but there are doomsayers who fear this outcome) - your view?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Youre Fired, Says the Robot. The Rise of Automation in the Workplace, Technophobes, and Fears of Unemployment

Abstract

 The rapid adoption of new technologies in the workplace, especially robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), has motivated some researchers to determine what effects such technologies may have. Few scholars, however, have examined the possibility that a large segment of the population is apprehensive about the quick pace of technological change and encroachment into modern life. Drawing from economic projections about the future of the digital economy and from literature in the sociology of technology and emotions, this article explores whether certain fears of technology exacerbate fears of unemployment and financial insecurity. Using data from Wave 2 of the Chapman Survey of American Fears (N = 1,541), I find that there exists a sizable population of technophobes or those who fear robots, AI, and technology they do not understand. Technophobes are also more likely than nontechnophobes to report having anxiety-related mental health issues and to fear unemployment and financial insecurity. With advances in robotics and AI, the threat of technological unemployment is discussed as a real concern among a substantial portion of the American population. </TEXT>

Mitogenomes and relatedness do not predict frequency of tool-use by sea otters

Katherine Ralls, Nancy Rotzel McInerney, Roderick B. Gagne, Holly B. Ernest, M. Tim Tinker, Jessica Fujii, Jesus Maldonado

Published 22 March 2017.

DOI: 10.1098/rsbl.2016.0880

Link:
http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/13/3/20160880

Abstract

 Many ecological aspects of tool-use in sea otters are similar to those in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. Within an area, most tool-using dolphins share a single mitochondrial haplotype and are more related to each other than to the population as a whole. We asked whether sea otters in California showed similar genetic patterns by sequencing mitogenomes of 43 otters and genotyping 154 otters at 38 microsatellite loci. There were six variable sites in the mitogenome that yielded three haplotypes, one found in only a single individual. The other two haplotypes contained similar percentages (33 and 36%) of frequent tool-users and a variety of diet types. Microsatellite analyses showed that snail specialists, the diet specialist group that most frequently used tools, were no more related to each other than to the population as a whole. The lack of genetic association among tool-using sea otters compared with dolphins may result from the length of time each species has been using tools. Tool-use in dolphins appears to be a relatively recent innovation (less than 200 years) but sea otters have probably been using tools for many thousands or even millions of years.

Abstract:

 The flagellar beat is extracted from human sperm digital imaging microscopy and used to determine the flow around the cell and its trajectory, via boundary element simulation. Comparison of the predicted cell trajectory with observation demonstrates that simulation can predict fine-scale sperm dynamics at the qualitative level. The flow field is also observed to reduce to a time-dependent summation of regularized Stokes flow singularities, approximated at leading order by a blinking force triplet. Such regularized singularity decompositions may be used to upscale cell level detail into population models of human sperm motility. </TEXT>

Abstract

 Introduction

 The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine have emphasized the need to promote vaginal delivery and have offered recommendations to safely prevent primary cesarean delivery. However, there has been limited discussion regarding management of intravenous fluids and other aspects of labor management that may influence labor. Therefore the aim of our study was to determine if an intravenous fluid rate of 250 vs 125 mL/hour is associated with a difference in cesarean delivery rate

 Material and methods

 Searches were performed in Medline, OVID, Scopus, ClinicalTrials. gov, the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials. We included all randomized controlled trials comparing intravenous fluid rates of 125 mL/hour vs. 250 mL/hour in nulliparous women in spontaneous labor at term with singleton pregnancies at  36 weeks. Studies were included regardless of the type of intravenous fluids used and regardless of whether or not oral intake was restricted during labor. Studies including multiparous women or women whose labor was induced were excluded. The primary outcome was the incidence of cesarean delivery. We planned to assess a sensitivity analysis according to type of fluids used and according to restriction of oral fluid intake

 Results

 Seven trials including 1,215 nulliparous women in spontaneous labor at term were analyzed. 593 (48.8%) were in the 250 mL/hour group, and 622 (51.2%) in the 125 mL/hour group. Five studies used lactated Ringer's solution, one used normal saline in dextrose water, and in one study it was unclear which intravenous fluid was used. Women who received intravenous fluids 250 mL/hour had a significantly lower incidence of cesarean delivery for any indication (12.5% vs 18.1%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92; 7 studies, 1,215 participants; I2=0%) and for dystocia (4.9% vs 7.7%; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.97; 5 studies, 1,093 participants; I2=18%) and a significantly shorter mean of duration of labor of about one hour (mean difference -64.38 minutes, 95% CI -121.88 to -6.88; 6 studies, 1,155 participants; I2=83%) and of length of second stage of labor (mean difference -2.80 minutes, 95% CI -4.49 to -1.10; 899 participants; I2=22%) compared to those who received intravenous fluid 125 mL/hour. No differences were found in the other secondary outcomes. There were no maternal or perinatal deaths and only one woman, in the 125 ml/hr group, developed pulmonary edema. The findings persisted regardless of the type of intravenous fluid used. No significant reduction in the incidence of cesarean delivery was demonstrated in women with unrestricted oral intake; however, this was limited to only 2 studies evaluating 254 women

 Conclusions

 In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that the duration of labor in low-risk nulliparous women may be shortened by a policy of intravenous fluids at a rate of 250 mL/hours rather than 125 mL/hours. This could also lead to a reduction in the incidence of cesarean delivery. The number needed to treat to prevent one cesarean delivery is 18 women. Our data support for increased hydration amongst nulliparous women in labor when oral intake is restricted. Further study is needed regarding risks and benefits of increased hydration among women with unrestricted oral intake, those undergoing induction of labor, and those with medical comorbidities. </TEXT>

Abstract

 Introduction:

 Sleep is a plausible target for public health promotion. We examined the association of changes in sleep with subsequent health and well-being in the general population.

 Aims and Methods:

We analyzed data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, involving 30594 people (aged  16) who provided data on sleep and health and well-being at both Wave 1 (20092011) and Wave 4 (20122014) assessments. Predicting variables were changes in sleep quantity, sleep quality, and sleep medication use over the 4-year period. Outcome variables were the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component scores at Wave 4. Linear regression on each outcome was fully adjusted for potential confounders and baseline values of the relevant predicting and outcome variables.

 Results:

 Better outcomes were associated with an increase in sleep duration (GHQ:  = 1.031 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.328, 0.734]; MCS: 1.531 [1.006, 2.055]; PCS: 0.071 [0.419, 0.56]), sleep quality (GHQ:  = 2.031 [95% CI: 2.218, 1.844]; MCS: 3.027 [2.692, 3.361]; PCS: 0.924 [0.604, 1.245]), and a reduction in sleep medication use (GHQ:  = 1.929 [95% CI: 2.400, 1.459]; MCS: 3.106 [2.279, 3.933]; PCS: 2.633 [1.860, 3.406]). Poorer outcomes were on the other hand associated with a reduction in sleep duration, a decrease in sleep quality, and an increase in sleep medication use. Changes in sleep quality yielded the largest effects on the health and well-being outcomes.

 Conclusions:

 Changes in sleep were temporally associated with subsequent health and well-being. Initiatives that aim to protect a critical amount of sleep, promote sleep quality, and reduce sleep medication use may have public health values. </TEXT>

Abstract

 Fast and simultaneous forward and reverse blood grouping has long remained elusive. Forward blood grouping detects antigens on red blood cells, whereas reverse grouping identifies specific antibodies present in plasma. We developed a paper-based assay using immobilized antibodies and bromocresol green dye for rapid and reliable blood grouping, where dye-assisted color changes corresponding to distinct blood components provide a visual readout. ABO antigens and five major Rhesus antigens could be detected within 30 s, and simultaneous forward and reverse ABO blood grouping using small volumes (100 l) of whole blood was achieved within 2 min through on-chip plasma separation without centrifugation. A machine-learning method was developed to classify the spectral plots corresponding to dye-based color changes, which enabled reproducible automatic grouping. Using optimized operating parameters, the dye-assisted paper assay exhibited comparable accuracy and reproducibility to the classical gel-card assays in grouping 3550 human blood samples. When translated to the assembly line and low-cost manufacturing, the proposed approach may be developed into a cost-effective and robust universal blood-grouping platform. </TEXT>

Autologous Induced Stem-CellDerived Retinal Cells for Macular Degeneration
Michiko Mandai, M.D., Ph.D., Akira Watanabe, Ph.D., Yasuo Kurimoto, M.D., Ph.D., Yasuhiko Hirami, M.

March 16, 2017

N Engl J Med 2017; 376:1038-1046

Abstract

 We assessed the feasibility of transplanting a sheet of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in a patient with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The iPSCs were generated from skin fibroblasts obtained from two patients with advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration and were differentiated into RPE cells. The RPE cells and the iPSCs from which they were derived were subject to extensive testing. A surgery that included the removal of the neovascular membrane and transplantation of the autologous iPSC-derived RPE cell sheet under the retina was performed in one of the patients. At 1 year after surgery, the transplanted sheet remained intact, best corrected visual acuity had not improved or worsened, and cystoid macular edema was present.

Abstract:

 The Ebola virus vaccine strategies evaluated by the World Health Organization in response to the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa included a heterologous primary and booster vaccination schedule of the adenovirus type 26 vector vaccine encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV) and the modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, and Tai Forest viruses nucleoprotein (MVA-BN-Filo). This schedule has been shown to induce immune responses that persist for 8 months after primary immunization, with 100% of vaccine recipients retaining Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific antibodies.1

Sulfate radicals enable a non-enzymatic Krebs cycle precursor

Nature Ecology   Evolution 1, Article number: 0083 (2017)

Abstract

 The evolutionary origins of the Krebs cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) are not currently clear. Despite the existence of a simple non-enzymatic Krebs cycle catalyst being dismissed only a few years ago as an appeal to magic, citrate and other intermediates have since been discovered on a carbonaceous meteorite and do interconvert non-enzymatically. To identify a metabolism-like non-enzymatic Krebs cycle catalyst, we used combinatorial, quantitative high-throughput metabolomics to systematically screen iron and sulfate compounds in a reaction mixture that orients on the typical components of Archaean sediment. Krebs cycle intermediates were found to be stable in water and in the presence of most molecule species, including simple iron sulfate minerals. However, in the presence of sulfate radicals generated from peroxydisulfate, the intermediates underwent 24 interconversion reactions. These non-enzymatic reactions covered the critical topology of the oxidative Krebs cycle, the glyoxylate shunt and the succinic-semialdehyde pathway. Assembled in a chemical network, the reactions achieved over 90% carbon recovery. Our results show that a non-enzymatic precursor of the Krebs cycle is biologically sensible, efficient, and forms spontaneously in the presence of sulfate radicals.

 The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or Krebs cycle, is a central metabolic pathway, typically of oxidative function. This metabolic pathway provides precursors for the biosynthesis of amino acids, and plays an essential role in fatty-acid breakdown, cellular respiration, and energy and redox metabolism1. The widespread occurrence of at least its oxidative reactions2,3 indicates that at least parts of the Krebs cycle originated at a very early stage in evolution; perhaps dating back to the origin of life4,5,6. A frequently discussed hypothesis proposes that the Krebs cycle obtained its structural topology by Darwinian selection principles that were enabled by the ribonucleic acid (RNA) world. A post-genetic origin implies that pathway topologies are subject to progressive change, implying that the modern Krebs cycle could differ substantially from its early precursors7. However, a post-genetic origin of metabolism struggles to explain how multiple, structurally complex enzymes came into being initially; enzymes themselves are made-up from the metabolic products of the Krebs cycle. Second, a Darwinian origin for the metabolic network topology has difficulties in explaining the high number of reactions that recur between kingdoms despite a lack of enzyme sequence conservation8. An alternative hypothesis thus proposes that at least the key metabolic reactions originated from environmental chemistry. In this scenario, inorganic catalysis determines the basic structure of metabolism9,10,11,12.

 As enzymatic mechanisms of the Krebs cycle have limited resemblance to inorganic catalysis, the idea of a non-enzymatic origin was received sceptically by many5,13. For instance, Leslie Orgel, a leading scientist in shaping the RNA world hypothesis, dismissed the possibility that a simple inorganic catalyst that could replace a series set of TCA-like reactions as an appeal to magic5. However, despite the fact that a simple catalyst was indeed missing, others have argued that several Krebs cycle metabolites form in organic chemical reactions9,10. Meanwhile, the presence of a series of TCA intermediates has been confirmed on a carbonaceous meteorite14. Furthermore, citrate and other TCA intermediates undergo highly efficient reductive interconversion reactions on semiconductor particles when exposed to strong ultraviolet light15. A non-enzymatic precursor to the Krebs cycle is therefore catalytically possible. Moreover, the existence of a unifying, simple catalyst has become plausible. Non-enzymatic reactions that replicate two other metabolic pathways, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, are united in their common dependence on ferrous iron as the catalyst and co-substrate16,17. Fe(II) is abundant in typical Archaean sediments18,19, implying that general chemical environments, rather than niche conditions, may have been key to shaping the structure of metabolic pathways.

 We chose a systematic screening strategy whereby ~4,850 absolute quantitative experiments were performed to examine the reactivity of TCA intermediates in the presence of typical Archaean sediment constituents, as well as related iron and sulfur species. We found that the TCA intermediates were unreactive in the presence of the majority of iron and sulfate combinations, including the simple mineral, ferrous sulfide (FeS). However, in the presence of the radical donor peroxydisulfate, we detected 24 non-enzymatic interconversion reactions. These reactions resemble the isomerization and oxidative reactions of the enzymatic Krebs cycle, the glyoxylate shunt and the succinic semialdehyde pathway, so that their critical topologies are covered. A chemical network assembled from these reactions achieves more than 90% carbon recovery, forming a plausible non-enzymatic precursor for the origin of the early Krebs cycle. </TEXT>

Would You Deliver an Electric Shock in 2015? Obedience in the Experimental Paradigm Developed by Stanley Milgram in the 50 Years Following the Original Studies

Article first published online: January 1, 2017

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550617693060

Abstract

 In spite of the over 50 years which have passed since the original experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram on obedience, these experiments are still considered a turning point in our thinking about the role of the situation in human behavior. While ethical considerations prevent a full replication of the experiments from being prepared, a certain picture of the level of obedience of participants can be drawn using the procedure proposed by Burger. In our experiment, we have expanded it by controlling for the sex of participants and of the learner. The results achieved show a level of participants obedience toward instructions similarly high to that of the original Milgram studies. Results regarding the influence of the sex of participants and of the learner, as well as of personality characteristics, do not allow us to unequivocally accept or reject the hypotheses offered.

Link to Wikipedia article on original Milgram experiment:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment

 The Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience; the experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of people were prepared to obey, albeit unwillingly, even if apparently causing serious injury and distress. Milgram first described his research in 1963 in an article published in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology[1] and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View.[2] </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Adjacent CpG sites in mammalian genomes can be co-methylated owing to the processivity of methyltransferases or demethylases, yet discordant methylation patterns have also been observed, which are related to stochastic or uncoordinated molecular processes. We focused on a systematic search and investigation of regions in the full human genome that show highly coordinated methylation. We defined 147,888 blocks of tightly coupled CpG sites, called methylation haplotype blocks, after analysis of 61 whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data sets and validation with 101 reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing data sets and 637 methylation array data sets. Using a metric called methylation haplotype load, we performed tissue-specific methylation analysis at the block level. Subsets of informative blocks were further identified for deconvolution of heterogeneous samples. Finally, using methylation haplotypes we demonstrated quantitative estimation of tumor load and tissue-of-origin mapping in the circulating cell-free DNA of 59 patients with lung or colorectal cancer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'll still need biopsies to work out the cell morphology for cancer staging, DNA typing etc which is important for treatment ultimately - I think this may potentially be more useful for initially screening/ confirmation of diagnosis and general location of the tumour, to guide the next steps, which is less invasive and more timely compared to having to wait for a biopsy of a mass or cyst. I agree with you - nothing beats actual tissue so you know what you're dealing with. </TEXT>

Childhood Gender-Typed Behavior and Adolescent Sexual Orientation: A Longitudinal Population-Based Study.

Li, Gu; Kung, Karson T. F.; Hines, Melissa

Developmental Psychology, Feb 20 , 2017, No Pagination Specified. 

http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000281

Abstract

 Lesbian and gay individuals have been reported to show more interest in other-sex, and/or less interest in same-sex, toys, playmates, and activities in childhood than heterosexual counterparts. Yet, most of the relevant evidence comes from retrospective studies or from prospective studies of clinically referred, extremely gender nonconforming children. In addition, findings are mixed regarding the relation between childhood gender-typed behavior and the later sexual orientation spectrum from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively lesbian/gay. The current study drew a sample (2,428 girls and 2,169 boys) from a population-based longitudinal study, and found that the levels of gender-typed behavior at ages 3.5 and 4.75 years, although less so at age 2.5 years, significantly and consistently predicted adolescents sexual orientation at age 15 years, both when sexual orientation was conceptualized as 2 groups or as a spectrum. In addition, within-individual change in gender-typed behavior during the preschool years significantly related to adolescent sexual orientation, especially in boys. These results suggest that the factors contributing to the link between childhood gender-typed behavior and sexual orientation emerge during early development. Some of those factors are likely to be nonsocial, because nonheterosexual individuals appear to diverge from gender norms regardless of social encouragement to conform to gender roles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

This is clearly a controversial topic dealing with potential gender stereotypes, and the Science commentary article states this here:

 Others dispute the papers methods and significance. Parents own beliefs and biases about gender almost certainly influence how they described their childrens gendered play, which could skew their reporting, says Patrick Ryan Grzanka, a psychologist who studies sexuality and multicultural issues at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. But more worrisome to him are the cultural assumptions underlying the study itself. The authors appear to regard gender nonconformity as the primary marker of gayness, which doesnt align with current research suggesting that your individual preferences for either stereotypically male or female behaviors and traits has little to do with your sexual orientation, he says.

 Grzanka is also dismayed that the paper fails to critique the history of similar research that investigated whether childhood behaviors lined up with eventual sexual orientation. It wasnt long ago that such research was used to stigmatize and pathologize gender-nonconforming children, he says. I think its important to ask why were so invested in this purported link [between gender conformity and sexuality] in the first place.

But it is a large longitudinal population-based study over a long time that I thought was worth sharing even though the finding may be deemed controversial by some. 

I want to point out that this was an observational study and that the finding is one of correlation, not causation. The researchers postulate that toddler play may be potentially predictive of teenage sexual orientation. No one is saying there is a causal relationship. Don't jump to conclusions and force your kids to play or not play with certain types of toys because you think there is a causal relationship. This is not that type of study. 

Due to the sensitive nature of the topic, please restrict comments to the scientific discussion of the findings rather than personal anecdotes. Anti-gay sentiment or homophobic statements of any sort will be removed by the mods.

Abstract:

 Introduction

 Although findings concerning sexual outcomes associated with cyberpornography use are mixed, viewing explicit sexual content online is becoming a common activity for an increasing number of individuals.

 Aim

 To investigate heterogeneity in cyberpornography-related sexual outcomes by examining a theoretically and clinically based model suggesting that individuals who spend time viewing online pornography form three distinct profiles (recreational, at-risk, and compulsive) and to examine whether these profiles were associated with sexual well-being, sex, and interpersonal context of pornography use.

 Methods

 The present cluster-analytic study was conducted using a convenience sample of 830 adults who completed online self-reported measurements of cyberpornography use and sexual well-being, which included sexual satisfaction, compulsivity, avoidance, and dysfunction.

 Main Outcomes Measures

 Dimensions of cyberpornography use were assessed using the Cyber Pornography Use Inventory. Sexual well-being measurements included the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction, the Sexual Compulsivity Scale, the Sexual Avoidance Subscale, and the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale.

 Results

 Cluster analyses indicated three distinct profiles: recreational (75.5%), highly distressed non-compulsive (12.7%), and compulsive (11.8%). Recreational users reported higher sexual satisfaction and lower sexual compulsivity, avoidance, and dysfunction, whereas users with a compulsive profile presented lower sexual satisfaction and dysfunction and higher sexual compulsivity and avoidance. Highly distressed less active users were sexually less satisfied and reported less sexual compulsivity and more sexual dysfunction and avoidance. A larger proportion of women and of dyadic users was found among recreational users, whereas solitary users were more likely to be in the highly distressed less active profile and men were more likely to be in the compulsive profile.

 Conclusion

 This pattern of results confirms the existence of recreational and compulsive profiles but also demonstrates the existence of an important subgroup of not particularly active, yet highly distressed consumers. Cyberpornography users represent a heterogeneous population, in which each subgroup is associated with specific sexual outcomes. </TEXT>

Summary:

 In a study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, scientists surveyed viewers of internet porn and identified that these individuals cluster in three distinct behavioral patterns: recreational, highly distressed non-compulsive, and compulsive.

 The researchers established these clusters after analyzing survey responses from 830 people aged 18 to 78. 71.8 percent of respondents were women, and 28.2 were men. The survey asked people about their cyberpornography viewing habits, as well as three dimensions of pornography use: sexual satisfaction, sexual avoidance, and sexual dysfunction.

 They found that 75.5 percent of users fit a recreational profile, which meant that they rated low on the three measures of pornography use.

 The researchers defined the second cluster, constituting 12.7 percent of survey respondents, as highly distressed non-compulsive. This meant they reported high levels of emotional distress associated with porn viewing habits, but they arent compulsive users and dont spend a lot of time hunting for porn.

 The third profile, compulsive, included 11.8 percent of respondents. This group is the reverse of the second group, spending lots of time seeking out explicit content and indulging in it compulsively, but reporting low levels of emotional distress associated with it. </TEXT>

Deep-Time Convergence in Rove Beetle Symbionts of Army Ants

Munetoshi Maruyama, Joseph Parker

Highlights

Army ant-parasitic rove beetles comprise an ancient system of complex convergence
Beetles anatomically mimic and deceive host ants to exploit nest resources
Convergent clades arose in the Cenozoic and share a Cretaceous common ancestor
Convergence over deep time challenges the notion of evolutionary contingency

Summary

 Recent adaptive radiations provide striking examples of convergence [1, 2, 3, 4], but the predictability of evolution over much deeper timescales is controversial, with a scarcity of ancient clades exhibiting repetitive patterns of phenotypic evolution [5, 6]. Army ants are ecologically dominant arthropod predators of the worlds tropics, with large nomadic colonies housing diverse communities of socially parasitic myrmecophiles [7]. Remarkable among these are many species of rove beetle (Staphylinidae) that exhibit ant-mimicking myrmecoid body forms and are behaviorally accepted into their aggressive hosts societies: emigrating with colonies and inhabiting temporary nest bivouacs, grooming and feeding with workers, but also consuming the brood [8, 9, 10, 11]. Here, we demonstrate that myrmecoid rove beetles are strongly polyphyletic, with this adaptive morphological and behavioral syndrome having evolved at least 12 times during the evolution of a single staphylinid subfamily, Aleocharinae. Each independent myrmecoid clade is restricted to one zoogeographic region and highly host specific on a single army ant genus. Dating estimates reveal that myrmecoid clades are separated by substantial phylogenetic distancesas much as 105 million years. All such groups arose in parallel during the Cenozoic, when army ants diversified into modern genera [12] and rose to ecological dominance [13, 14]. This work uncovers a rare example of an ancient system of complex morphological and behavioral convergence, with replicate beetle lineages following a predictable phenotypic trajectory during their parasitic adaptation to host colonies.

<TEXT> Great question. 

From the article itself:

 "While the pain-relieving qualities of green LED are clear, exactly how it works remains a puzzle," says Rajesh Khanna, UA associate professor of pharmacology and senior author of the study. "Early studies show that green light is increasing the levels of circulating endogenous opioids, which may explain the pain-relieving effects. Whether this will be observed in humans is not yet known and needs further work."

So the answer in humans is, maybe, but we need more research to confirm.  </TEXT>

Long-lasting antinociceptive effects of green light in acute and chronic pain in rats

Abstract:

 Treatments for chronic pain are inadequate, and new options are needed. Nonpharmaceutical approaches are especially attractive with many potential advantages including safety. Light therapy has been suggested to be beneficial in certain medical conditions such as depression, but this approach remains to be explored for modulation of pain. We investigated the effects of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), in the visible spectrum, on acute sensory thresholds in naive rats as well as in experimental neuropathic pain. Rats receiving green LED light (wavelength 525 nm, 8 h/d) showed significantly increased paw withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus; this antinociceptive effect persisted for 4 days after termination of last exposure without development of tolerance. No apparent side effects were noted and motor performance was not impaired. Despite LED exposure, opaque contact lenses prevented antinociception. Rats fitted with green contact lenses exposed to room light exhibited antinociception arguing for a role of the visual system. Antinociception was not due to stress/anxiety but likely due to increased enkephalins expression in the spinal cord. Naloxone reversed the antinociception, suggesting involvement of central opioid circuits. Rostral ventromedial medulla inactivation prevented expression of light-induced antinociception suggesting engagement of descending inhibition. Green LED exposure also reversed thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in rats with spinal nerve ligation. Pharmacological and proteomic profiling of dorsal root ganglion neurons from green LED-exposed rats identified changes in calcium channel activity, including a decrease in the N-type (CaV2.2) channel, a primary analgesic target. Thus, green LED therapy may represent a novel, nonpharmacological approach for managing pain. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Objective

 To examine associations between insufficient sleep and neurobehavioral functioning in childhood as reported by mothers and teachers.

 Methods

 Participants were 1046 children in a pre-birth cohort study. Main exposures were insufficient sleep durations at three time points: 6 months to 2 years, defined as sleep  11 hours/day, 11-12 hours/day (v.  12); 3 to 4 years, defined as sleep  10 hours/day, 10-11 hours/day (v. 11); and 5 to 7 years, sleep  9 hours/day, 9-10 hours/day (v.  10). Outcomes at age 7 were executive function, behavior, and social-emotional functioning, assessed by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Higher scores indicate poorer functioning. Mothers and teachers completed both instruments independently.

 Results

 At age 7, mean (SD) mother and teacher report of the BRIEF global executive composite scale were 48.3 (7.9) and 50.7 (9.4) points, respectively, and of the SDQ total difficulties score was 6.5 (4.7) and 6.2 (5.7). In multivariable models, children who slept 10 hours/day at 3-4 years had worse maternal-reported scores for the BRIEF (2.11 points; 95% CI: 0.17, 4.05) and SDQ (1.91 points; 95% CI: 0.78, 3.05) than those with age-appropriate sleep. Children who slept 9 hours/day at 5-7 years also had worse scores. At both ages, associations with teacher-reported results were consistent with mothers. Infants who slept 11-12 hours/day had higher teacher- but not mother-reported scores.

 Conclusions

 Insufficient sleep in the preschool and early school years is associated with poorer mother- and teacher-reported neurobehavioral processes in mid-childhood. </TEXT>

Abstract

 Separate literatures have related volunteering to health gains and income gains. We study the association between volunteering, income and health within one statistical framework. A state-of-the-art mediation analysis is conducted on data concerning the health, volunteering and sociodemographic characteristics of 42926 individuals within 29 European countries. We find that volunteering is positively associated to self-rated health. This association is partially mediated by household income. </TEXT>

Exposure of in-pram babies to airborne particles during morning drop-in and afternoon pick-up of school children

Prashant Kumar, Ioar Rivas, Lovish Sachdeva

Environmental Pollution

Available online 6 March 2017,

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116323120?via%3Dihub

Abstract:

 In-pram babies are more susceptible to air pollution effects, yet studies assessing their exposure are limited. We measured size-resolved particle mass (PMC; 0.2532 m) and number (PNC; 0.21 m) concentrations on a 2.7 km route. The instruments were placed inside a baby pram. The route passed through 4 traffic intersections (TIs) and a bus stand. A total of 87 km road length was covered through 64 trips, made during school drop-in (morning) and pick-up (afternoon) hours. The objectives were to assess PMC and PNC exposure to in-pram babies at different route segments, understand their physicochemical characteristics and exposure differences between in-pram babies and adults carrying them. Over 5-fold variability (14.178.2 g m3) was observed in PMCs. Small-sized particles, including ultrafine particles, were always higher by 66% (PM1), 29% (PM2.5) and 31% (PNC) during the morning than afternoon. Coarse particles (PM2.5-10) showed an opposite trend with 70% higher concentration during afternoon than morning. TIs emerged as pollution hotspots for all the particle types. For example, PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PNCs during the morning (afternoon) at TIs were 7 (10)%, 19 (10)% and 68 (62)% higher, respectively, compared with the rest of the route. Bus stand was also a section of enhanced exposure to PNC and PM2.5, although not so much for PM2.5-10. EDX analyses revealed Cl, Na and Fe as dominant elements. Road salt might be a source of NaCl due to de-icing during the measurements while Fe contributed by non-exhaust emissions from brake abrasion. The respiratory deposition rates imitated the trend of PMC, with higher doses of coarse and fine particles during the afternoon and morning runs, respectively. Special protection measures during conveyance of in-pram babies, especially at pollution hotspots such as traffic intersections and bus stands, could help to limit their exposure.

Cross-sectional study of social behaviors in preschool children and exposure to flame retardants

Shannon T. Lipscomb, Megan M. McClelland, Megan MacDonald, Andres Cardenas, Kim A. Anderson
and Molly L. Kile

Abstract:

 Background

 Children are exposed to flame retardants from the built environment. Brominated diphenyl ethers (BDE) and organophosphate-based flame retardants (OPFRs) are associated with poorer neurocognitive functioning in children. Less is known, however, about the association between these classes of compounds and childrens emotional and social behaviors. The objective of this study was to determine if flame retardant exposure was associated with measurable differences in social behaviors among children ages 35 years.

 Methods

 We examined teacher-rated social behaviors measured using the Social Skills Improvement Rating Scale (SSIS) and personal exposure to flame retardants in children aged 35 years who attended preschool (n=72). Silicone passive samplers worn for 7 days were used to assess personal exposure to 41 compounds using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometer. These concentrations were then summed into total BDE and total OPFR exposure prior to natural log transformation. Separate generalized additive models were used to evaluate the relationship between seven subscales of the SSIS and lnBDE or lnOPFR adjusting for other age, sex, adverse social experiences, and family context.

 Results

 All children were exposed to a mixture of flame retardant compounds. We observed a dose dependent relationship between lnOPFR and two subscales where children with higher exposures were rated by their preschool teachers as having less responsible behavior (p=0.07) and more externalizing behavior problems (p=0.03). Additionally, children with higher lnBDE exposure were rated by teachers as less assertive (p=0.007).

 Conclusions

 We observed a cross-sectional association between childrens exposure to flame retardant compounds and teacher-rated social behaviors among preschool-aged children. Children with higher flame retardant exposures exhibited poorer social skills in three domains that play an important role in a childs ability to succeed academically and socially. </TEXT>

Public perceptions of arguments supporting and opposing recreational marijuana legalization

Emma E. McGintyJeff NiederdeppeKathryn HeleyColleen L. Barry

Highlights

 Strong arguments in favor of recreational marijuana legalization focus on economic benefits.
 Respondents who agree with economic arguments are more likely to support legalization.
 Supportive economic arguments are stronger than opposing public health arguments.

Abstract

 In debates about recreational marijuana legalization, pro-legalization arguments highlighting economic and other potential policy benefits compete with anti-legalization arguments emphasizing public health risks. In 2016, we conducted a national survey using an online panel (N = 979) designed to answer two main research questions: (1) How do Americans perceive the relative strength of competing arguments about recreational marijuana legalization? (2) How are perceptions of argument strength associated with public support for recreational marijuana legalization? We examined differences in attitudes among individuals living in states that have/have not legalized recreational marijuana and among Democrats/Independents/Republicans. Ordered logit regression assessed the relationship between perceived argument strength and public support for recreational marijuana legalization. Respondents rated pro-legalization arguments highlighting beneficial economic and criminal justice consequences as more persuasive than anti-legalization arguments emphasizing adverse public health effects. Respondents were more likely to agree with arguments highlighting legalization's potential to increase tax revenue (63.9%) and reduce prison overcrowding (62.8%) than arguments emphasizing negative consequences on motor vehicle crashes (51.8%) and youth health (49.6%). The highest rated anti-legalization arguments highlighted the conflict between state and federal marijuana laws (63.0%) and asserted that legalization will fail to eliminate the black market (57.2%). Respondents who endorsed pro-legalization economic and criminal justice arguments were more likely than other respondents to support legalization. Our findings indicate that, on both side of the recreational marijuana legalization debate, there are arguments that resonate with the American public. However, public health risk messages were viewed as less compelling than pro-legalization economic and criminal justice-oriented arguments.

Abstract:

 Electrochemical analysis of sweat using soft bioelectronics on human skin provides a new route for noninvasive glucose monitoring without painful blood collection. However, sweat-based glucose sensing still faces many challenges, such as difficulty in sweat collection, activity variation of glucose oxidase due to lactic acid secretion and ambient temperature changes, and delamination of the enzyme when exposed to mechanical friction and skin deformation. Precise point-of-care therapy in response to the measured glucose levels is still very challenging. We present a wearable/disposable sweat-based glucose monitoring device integrated with a feedback transdermal drug delivery module. Careful multilayer patch design and miniaturization of sensors increase the efficiency of the sweat collection and sensing process. Multimodal glucose sensing, as well as its real-time correction based on pH, temperature, and humidity measurements, maximizes the accuracy of the sensing. The minimal layout design of the same sensors also enables a strip-type disposable device. Drugs for the feedback transdermal therapy are loaded on two different temperature-responsive phase change nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are embedded in hyaluronic acid hydrogel microneedles, which are additionally coated with phase change materials. This enables multistage, spatially patterned, and precisely controlled drug release in response to the patients glucose level. The system provides a novel closed-loop solution for the noninvasive sweat-based management of diabetes mellitus. </TEXT>

Highlights

* Memory champions show distributed functional brain network connectivity changes
* Mnemonic strategies for superior memory can be learned by naive subjects
* Mnemonic training induces similarity with memory champion brain connectivity
* Brain network dynamics of this effect differ between task and resting state

Summary

 Memory skills strongly differ across the general population; however, little is known about the brain characteristics supporting superior memory performance. Here we assess functional brain network organization of 23 of the worlds most successful memory athletes and matched controls with fMRI during both task-free resting state baseline and active memory encoding. We demonstrate that, in a group of naive controls, functional connectivity changes induced by 6 weeks of mnemonic training were correlated with the network organization that distinguishes athletes from controls. During rest, this effect was mainly driven by connections between rather than within the visual, medial temporal lobe and default mode networks, whereas during task it was driven by connectivity within these networks. Similarity with memory athlete connectivity patterns predicted memory improvements up to 4 months after training. In conclusion, mnemonic training drives distributed rather than regional changes, reorganizing the brains functional network organization to enable superior memory performance. </TEXT>

 No one likes to be on the receiving end of a needle, which can make routine childhood vaccinations especially problematic. Aran et al. developed a needle-free drug delivery device that can be administered orally. The MucoJet device used a simple chemical reaction to deliver a jet of vaccinein this case, ovalbuminthat penetrated the buccal mucosa when placed against the cheek inside the oral cavity in rabbits. The rabbits showed evidence of anti-ovalbumin antibodies in cheek tissue and ear vein blood draws up to 6 weeks after vaccination.

Abstract

 Noninvasive immunization technologies have the potential to revolutionize global health by providing easy-to-administer vaccines at low cost, enabling mass immunizations during pandemics. Existing technologies such as transdermal microneedles are costly, deliver drugs slowly, and cannot generate mucosal immunity, which is important for optimal immunity against pathogens. We present a needle-free microjet immunization device termed MucoJet, which is a three-dimensional microelectromechanical systemsbased drug delivery technology. MucoJet is administered orally, placed adjacent to the buccal tissue within the oral cavity, and uses a self-contained gas-generating chemical reaction within its two-compartment plastic housing to produce a high-pressure liquid jet of vaccine. We show that the vaccine jet ejected from the MucoJet device is capable of penetrating the buccal mucosal layer in silico, in porcine buccal tissue ex vivo, and in rabbits in vivo. Rabbits treated with ovalbumin by MucoJet delivery have antibody titers of anti-ovalbumin immunoglobulins G and A in blood serum and buccal tissue, respectively, that are three orders of magnitude higher than rabbits receiving free ovalbumin delivered topically by a dropper in the buccal region. MucoJet has the potential to accelerate the development of noninvasive oral vaccines, given its ability to elicit antibody production that is detectable locally in the buccal tissue and systemically via the circulation. </TEXT>

Massive increase in visual range preceded the origin of terrestrial vertebrates.

Abstract:

 The evolution of terrestrial vertebrates, starting around 385 million years ago, is an iconic moment in evolution that brings to mind images of fish transforming into four-legged animals. Here, we show that this radical change in body shape was preceded by an equally dramatic change in sensory abilities akin to transitioning from seeing over short distances in a dense fog to seeing over long distances on a clear day. Measurements of eye sockets and simulations of their evolution show that eyes nearly tripled in size just before vertebrates began living on land. Computational simulations of these animals visual ecology show that for viewing objects through water, the increase in eye size provided a negligible increase in performance. However, when viewing objects through air, the increase in eye size provided a large increase in performance. The jump in eye size was, therefore, unlikely to have arisen for seeing through water and instead points to an unexpected hybrid of seeing through air while still primarily inhabiting water. Our results and several anatomical innovations arising at the same time suggest lifestyle similarity to crocodiles. The consequent combination of the increase in eye size and vision through air would have conferred a 1 million-fold increase in the amount of space within which objects could be seen. The buena vista hypothesis that our data suggest is that seeing opportunities from afar played a role in the subsequent evolution of fully terrestrial limbs as well as the emergence of elaborated action sequences through planning circuits in the nervous system. </TEXT>

Public Awareness of and Contact With Physicians Who Receive Industry Payments: A National Survey. 

Genevieve Pham-Kanter, Michelle M. Mello, Lisa Soleymani Lehmann, Eric G. Campbell, Daniel Carpenter. 

Journal of General Internal Medicine, 2017; 

First Online: 06 March 2017

DOI: 10.1007/s11606-017-4012-3

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-017-4012-3

Abstract:

 Background

 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, part of the Affordable Care Act, requires pharmaceutical and medical device firms to report payments they make to physicians and, through its Open Payments program, makes this information publicly available.

 Objective

 To establish estimates of the exposure of the American patient population to physicians who accept industry payments, to compare these population-based estimates to physician-based estimates of industry contact, and to investigate Americans awareness of industry payments.

 Design

 Cross-sectional survey conducted in late September and early October 2014, with data linkage of respondents physicians to Open Payments data.

 Participants

 A total of 3542 adults drawn from a large, nationally representative household panel.

 Main Measures

 Respondents contact with physicians reported in Open Payments to have received industry payments; respondents awareness that physicians receive payments from industry and that payment information is publicly available; respondents knowledge of whether their own physician received industry payments.

 Key Results

 Among the 1987 respondents who could be matched to a specific physician, 65% saw a physician who had received an industry payment during the previous 12 months. This population-based estimate of exposure to industry contact is much higher than physician-based estimates from the same period, which indicate that 41% of physicians received an industry payment. Across the six most frequently visited specialties, patient contact with physicians who had received an industry payment ranged from 60 to 85%; the percentage of physicians with industry contact in these specialties was much lower (3556%). Only 12% of survey respondents knew that payment information was publicly available, and only 5% knew whether their own doctor had received payments.

 Conclusions

 Patients contact with physicians who receive industry payments is more prevalent than physician-based measures of industry contact would suggest. Very few Americans know whether their own doctor has received industry payments or are aware that payment information is publicly available. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Sexual behavior represents relatively common and mundane home-life behavior, with demonstrated impact on both mood and general physical and psychological well-being. Integrating emergent research on sex and mood with theory on work-life enrichment, we propose a novel model demonstrating the effects of sexual behavior at home on next-day job satisfaction and job engagement as a function of positive affect. Using a 2-week daily diary study of married, employed adults, we found that (a) when employees engaged in sex at home, they reported increased positive affect at work the following day, independent of the effects of marital satisfaction; (b) sex at home increased both daily job satisfaction and daily job engagement as a function of increased positive affect; and (c) daily work-to-family strain-based conflict significantly reduced the likelihood of engaging in sex at home that evening. Accordingly, we extend theory on work-life enrichment by demonstrating the import of seemingly banal behavior on daily work life, with implications for work-life impingement. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 The limited number of known low-band-gap photoelectrocatalytic materials poses a significant challenge for the generation of chemical fuels from sunlight. Using high-throughput ab initio theory with experiments in an integrated workflow, we find eight ternary vanadate oxide photoanodes in the target band-gap range (1.22.8 eV). Detailed analysis of these vanadate compounds reveals the key role of VO4 structural motifs and electronic band-edge character in efficient photoanodes, initiating a genome for such materials and paving the way for a broadly applicable high-throughput-discovery and materials-by-design feedback loop. Considerably expanding the number of known photoelectrocatalysts for water oxidation, our study establishes ternary metal vanadates as a prolific class of photoanode materials for generation of chemical fuels from sunlight and demonstrates our high-throughput theoryexperiment pipeline as a prolific approach to materials discovery. </TEXT>

Advanced oil sorbents using sequential infiltration synthesis

Abstract:

 Disasters on the scale of the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon serve as harrowing reminders of the devastating effects uncontrolled oil spills have on the environment. Skimming, burning, and dispersing oil are only partially effective and carry their own ecological impacts. An enticing alternative strategy involves oil sorbents capable of efficient extraction of oil from water bodies, which in turn necessitates the design and implementation of novel materials Here, we extend methods of sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) traditionally only applied to nanometer scale thin films to create oil sorbents based on macroscopic, commercially available polymeric foams. Targeting superoleophilic and superhydrophobic chemistries, we demonstrate the propensity of SIS-based modifications in oil spill remediation and demonstrate its efficacy in crude oil sorption in model seawater. We find crude oil sorption on the order of 30 and 90 times the initial foam weight for polyurethane and polyimide, respectively, both with highly favorable reusability. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Although morphine remains the primary drug prescribed for alleviation of severe or persistent pain, both preclinical and clinical studies have shown that females require 2-3 times more morphine than males to produce comparable levels of analgesia. In addition to binding to the neuronal  opioid receptor (MOR), morphine binds to the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) localized primarily on microglia. Morphine action at TLR4 initiates a neuroinflammatory response that directly opposes the analgesic effects of morphine. Here we test the hypothesis that the attenuated response to morphine observed in females is the result of increased microglia activation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a central locus mediating the antinociceptive effects of morphine. We report that while no overall sex differences in the density of microglia were noted within the PAG of male or female rats, microglia exhibited a more activated phenotype in females at baseline, with the degree of activation a significant predictor of morphine ED50 values. Priming microglia with LPS induced greater microglia activation in the PAG of females compared with males that was accompanied by increased transcription levels of IL-1 and a significant rightward shift in the morphine dose response curve. Blockade of morphine binding to PAG TLR4 with (+)-naloxone significantly potentiated morphine antinociception in females such that no sex differences in ED50 were observed. These results demonstrate that PAG microglia are sexually dimorphic in both basal and LPS-induced activation, and contribute to the sexually dimorphic effects of morphine in the rat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi - thanks for the feedback. I'm the OP of this post and a mod in this sub. For the record, I'm not even American and have no particular view about US politics per se. When I come across interesting and relevant articles on a topic related to a sub, I will post it as it may be of interest to other Redditors. I have posted articles about other political parties on both sides of the political spectrum and from other countries too. It just so happens that Trump is particularly newsworthy at the moment, hence the inordinate number of articles being posted about him. I don't have a particular agenda and I'm not part of a coordinated posting group if you're wondering. Hope this clears your query up.  </TEXT>

Improving late life depression and cognitive control through the use of therapeutic video game technology: A proof-of-concept randomized trial

Joaquin A. Anguera1,2,*, Faith M. Gunning3 andPatricia A. Aren4,*

Depression and Anxiety, 00, 110. 

Version of Record online: 3 JAN 2017

Abstract:

 Background

 Existing treatments for depression are known to have only modest effects, are insufficiently targeted, and are inconsistently utilized, particularly in older adults. Indeed, older adults with impaired cognitive control networks tend to demonstrate poor response to a majority of existing depression interventions. Cognitive control interventions delivered using entertainment software have the potential to not only target the underlying cerebral dysfunction associated with depression, but to do so in a manner that is engaging and engenders adherence to treatment protocol.

 Methods

 In this proof-of-concept trial (Clinicaltrials.gov #: NCT02229188), individuals with late life depression (LLD) (22; 60+ years old) were randomized to either problem solving therapy (PST, n = 10) or a neurobiologically inspired digital platform designed to enhance cognitive control faculties (Project: EVO, n = 12). Given the overlapping functional neuroanatomy of mood disturbances and executive dysfunction, we explored the impact of an intervention targeting cognitive control abilities, functional disability, and mood in older adults suffering from LLD, and how those outcomes compare to a therapeutic gold standard.

 Results

 EVO participants demonstrated similar improvements in mood and self-reported function after 4 weeks of treatment to PST participants. The EVO participants also showed generalization to untrained measures of working memory and attention, as well as negativity bias, a finding not evident in the PST condition. Individuals assigned to EVO demonstrated 100% adherence.

 Conclusions

 This study provides preliminary findings that this therapeutic video game targeting cognitive control deficits may be an efficacious LLD intervention. Future research is needed to confirm these findings. </TEXT>

Nonpainful remote electrical stimulation alleviates episodic migraine pain

David Yarnitsky, MD, Lana Volokh, PhD, Alon Ironi, Boaz Weller, MD, Merav Shor, Alla Shifrin, MD and Yelena Granovsky, PhD

Published online before print March 1, 2017,

Abstract:

 Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of remote nonpainful electrical upper arm skin stimulation in reducing migraine attack pain.

 Methods: This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, crossover, sham-controlled trial. Migraineurs applied skin electrodes to the upper arm soon after attack onset for 20 minutes, at various pulse widths, and refrained from medications for 2 hours. Patients were asked to use the device for up to 20 attacks.

 Results: In 71 patients (299 treatments) with evaluable data, 50% pain reduction was obtained for 64% of participants based on best of 200-s, 150-s, and 100-s pulse width stimuli per individual vs 26% for sham stimuli. Greater pain reduction was found for active stimulation vs placebo; for those starting at severe or moderate pain, reduction (1) to mild or no pain occurred in 58% (25/43) of participants (66/134 treatments) for the 200-s stimulation protocol and 24% (4/17; 8/29 treatments) for placebo (p = 0.02), and (2) to no pain occurred in 30% (13/43) of participants (37/134 treatments) and 6% (1/17; 5/29 treatments), respectively (p = 0.004). Earlier application of the treatment, within 20 minutes of attack onset, yielded better results: 46.7% pain reduction as opposed to 24.9% reduction when started later (p = 0.02).

 Conclusion: Nonpainful remote skin stimulation can significantly reduce migraine pain, especially when applied early in an attack. This is presumably by activating descending inhibition pathways via the conditioned pain modulation effect. This treatment may be proposed as an attractive nonpharmacologic, easy to use, adverse event free, and inexpensive tool to reduce migraine pain. </TEXT>

Poor replication validity of biomedical association studies reported by newspapers

Estelle Dumas-Mallet ,Andy Smith, Thomas Boraud, Franois Gonon

Published: February 21, 2017h

Full text link:
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172650

Abstract:

 Objective

 To investigate the replication validity of biomedical association studies covered by newspapers.

 Methods

 We used a database of 4723 primary studies included in 306 meta-analysis articles. These studies associated a risk factor with a disease in three biomedical domains, psychiatry, neurology and four somatic diseases. They were classified into a lifestyle category (e.g. smoking) and a non-lifestyle category (e.g. genetic risk). Using the database Dow Jones Factiva, we investigated the newspaper coverage of each study. Their replication validity was assessed using a comparison with their corresponding meta-analyses.

 Results

 Among the 5029 articles of our database, 156 primary studies (of which 63 were lifestyle studies) and 5 meta-analysis articles were reported in 1561 newspaper articles. The percentage of covered studies and the number of newspaper articles per study strongly increased with the impact factor of the journal that published each scientific study. Newspapers almost equally covered initial (5/39 12.8%) and subsequent (58/600 9.7%) lifestyle studies. In contrast, initial non-lifestyle studies were covered more often (48/366 13.1%) than subsequent ones (45/3718 1.2%). Newspapers never covered initial studies reporting null findings and rarely reported subsequent null observations. Only 48.7% of the 156 studies reported by newspapers were confirmed by the corresponding meta-analyses. Initial non-lifestyle studies were less often confirmed (16/48) than subsequent ones (29/45) and than lifestyle studies (31/63). Psychiatric studies covered by newspapers were less often confirmed (10/38) than the neurological (26/41) or somatic (40/77) ones. This is correlated to an even larger coverage of initial studies in psychiatry. Whereas 234 newspaper articles covered the 35 initial studies that were later disconfirmed, only four press articles covered a subsequent null finding and mentioned the refutation of an initial claim.

 Conclusion

 Journalists preferentially cover initial findings although they are often contradicted by meta-analyses and rarely inform the public when they are disconfirmed. </TEXT>

Protection against fine particle-induced pulmonary and systemic inflammation by omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids

Xiang-Yong LiLei HaoYing-Hua LiuChih-Yu ChenVictor J. PaiJing X. Kang

Full text link:

Abstract

 Background

 Exposure to fine particulate matter, such as through air pollution, has been linked to the increased incidence of chronic diseases. However, few measures have been taken to reduce the health risks associated with fine particle exposure. The identification of safe and effective methods to protect against fine particle exposure-related damage is urgently needed.

 Methods

 We used synthetic, non-toxic, fluorescent fine particles to investigate the physical distribution of inhaled fine particles and their effects on pulmonary and systemic inflammation in mice. Tissue levels of omega-3 fatty acids were elevated via dietary supplementation or the fat-1 transgenic mouse model. Markers of pulmonary and systemic inflammation were assessed.

 Results

 We discovered that fine particulate matter not only accumulates in the lungs but can also penetrate the pulmonary barrier and travel into other organs, including the brain, liver, spleen, kidney, and testis. These particles induced both pulmonary and systemic inflammation and increased oxidative stress. We also show that elevating tissue levels of omega-3 fatty acids was effective in reducing fine particle-induced inflammation, whether as a preventive method (prior to exposure) or as an intervention (after exposure).

 Conclusions

 These results advance our understanding of how fine particles contribute to disease development and suggest that increasing tissue omega-3 levels may be a promising nutritional means for reducing the risk of diseases induced by particle exposure. </TEXT>

Emergence of function from coordinated cells in a tissue

Indika Rajapakse, Stephen Smale. 

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2017; 114 (7): 1462 

DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1621145114

Significance

 A basic problem in biology is understanding how information from a single genome gives rise to function in a mature multicellular tissue. Genome dynamics stabilize to give rise to a protein distribution in a given cell type, which in turn gives rise to the identity of a cell. We build a highly idealized mathematical foundation that combines the genome (within cell) and the diffusion (between cell) dynamical forces. The trade-off between these forces gives rise to the emergence of function. We define emergence as the coordinated effect of individual components that establishes an objective not possible for an individual component. Our setting of emergence may further our understanding of normal tissue function and dysfunctional states such as cancer.

Abstract

 This work presents a mathematical study of tissue dynamics. We combine within-cell genome dynamics and diffusion between cells, so that the synthesis of the two gives rise to the emergence of function, akin to establishing tissue homeostasis. We introduce two concepts, monotonicity and a weak version of hardwiring. 

 These together are sufficient for global convergence of the tissue dynamics.

 Is there a basis for emergence of tissue-specific function? Emergence in this work is defined as the coordinated effect of individual components that establishes an objective not possible for an individual component. Our components are cells with their proteins, and the objective is the function of a tissue. Here tissue is a set of cells of the same cell type located together as exemplified by an organ in the body. In vertebrates, consider the liver, functioning to detoxify and ensure an appropriate composition of blood, and the skeletal muscle, functioning to contract and generate force. In each of these tissues millions of individual cells contribute to emergence of function according to their cell type. The main elements of emergence that we consider are first, the protein distribution in a given cell type and second, the cellular architecture of the tissue, a 3D structure with diffusion of molecules between cells. We build a mathematical model for emergence of function, from a large accumulation of data.

Significance

 A basic problem in biology is understanding how information from a single genome gives rise to function in a mature multicellular tissue. Genome dynamics stabilize to give rise to a protein distribution in a given cell type, which in turn gives rise to the identity of a cell. We build a highly idealized mathematical foundation that combines the genome (within cell) and the diffusion (between cell) dynamical forces. The trade-off between these forces gives rise to the emergence of function. We define emergence as the coordinated effect of individual components that establishes an objective not possible for an individual component. Our setting of emergence may further our understanding of normal tissue function and dysfunctional states such as cancer.

Abstract

 This work presents a mathematical study of tissue dynamics. We combine within-cell genome dynamics and diffusion between cells, so that the synthesis of the two gives rise to the emergence of function, akin to establishing tissue homeostasis. We introduce two concepts, monotonicity and a weak version of hardwiring. 

 These together are sufficient for global convergence of the tissue dynamics.

 Is there a basis for emergence of tissue-specific function? Emergence in this work is defined as the coordinated effect of individual components that establishes an objective not possible for an individual component. Our components are cells with their proteins, and the objective is the function of a tissue. Here tissue is a set of cells of the same cell type located together as exemplified by an organ in the body. In vertebrates, consider the liver, functioning to detoxify and ensure an appropriate composition of blood, and the skeletal muscle, functioning to contract and generate force. In each of these tissues millions of individual cells contribute to emergence of function according to their cell type. The main elements of emergence that we consider are first, the protein distribution in a given cell type and second, the cellular architecture of the tissue, a 3D structure with diffusion of molecules between cells. We build a mathematical model for emergence of function, from a large accumulation of data. We also use our previous work on cell dynamics (genome dynamics) and the work of Alan Turing on diffusion (1).

 Underlying our setting are widely believed biological hypotheses: (i) Cells within a tissue (i.e., the same cell type) have the same dynamics and the same distribution of proteins at equilibrium and (ii) the function of a cell corresponds to the proteins of that cell. For reasons that will be discussed, we call the property in i hardwiring of the tissue (2, 3). Convergence of the tissue dynamics to such an equilibrium naturally takes on importance, for its role in maintenance of tissue function (4). Even a local stability of the (hardwiring) equilibrium, i.e., its robustness, gives some validity to our model in biology. Our main theorem (Theorem 5) establishes that monotonicity, a property that we introduce here, implies global convergence of the tissue dynamics to the equilibrium, where all cells have the same protein distribution. This gives a biological justification for our framework and a model for emergence of function, as well as suggestions for studying the passage from emergence to morphogenesis. On the other hand one could see the emergence described here as a final stage of morphogenesis, completing a cycle.

 Our model could give some support to obtaining more insights. Further questions, where quantitative support is expected, are also suggested: (i) To what extent is there a common equilibrium of proteins in each cell in a tissue? (ii) How do cells in a tissue cooperate to give rise to function? And (iii) how do we measure the diffusion between the cells? </TEXT>

Depression among current, former, and never smokers from 2005 to 2013: The hidden role of disparities in depression in the ongoing tobacco epidemic

Renee D. Goodwin, Melanie M. Wall, Lorra Garey, Michael J. Zvolensky, Lisa Dierker, Sandro Galea, Misato Gbedemah, Andrea H. Weinberger, Jill M. Williams, Mei-Chen Hu, Deborah S. Hasin

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.11.038

Highlights

Depression is persistently twice as common among current smokers, compared with former and never smokers from 20052013.
Depression has not significantly increased among current smokers overall from 20052013.
Depression has increased significantly among demographic subgroups of current smokers.
Depression increased most prominently among young, male and high-income daily smokers.

Background

After declining sharply for many years, the prevalence of smoking has remained fairly stable over the past decade. One possible explanation is that there has been an increase in the prevalence of barriers to cessation, like depression, among remaining smokers.

Objectives

To estimate changes in the prevalence of depression among current, former and never smokers in the United States (U.S.) population from 2005 to 2013 overall and by age, gender, and income.

Methods

Data were drawn from the National Household Survey on Drug Use (NSDUH), an annual cross-sectional study of persons ages 12 and over (N=496,805). The prevalence of past 12-month depression was examined annually among current (past 12-month), former (not past 12-month), and lifetime non-smokers from 2005 to 2013. Data were re-analyzed stratified by age, gender, and household income, and adjusted for demographics.

Results

Depression appears to have significantly increased in the United States from 2005 to 2013 among current, former, and never smokers. Depression prevalence increased among current smokers overall, but the increase among former and never smokers was even more prominent. Striking temporal changes emerged by age, gender and income. Specifically, (1) depression increased significantly among current smokers aged 1217 (from 16% to 22%, p-value=0.0002) and the prevalence was consistently more than twice as high as that of never smokers; (2) depression increased among male smokers (6.19%7.82%, p-value=0.0099); (3) depression increased significantly among smokers in the highest income group (6.36% to 8.91%, p-value=0.0400). Throughout this period, the prevalence of depression among current smokers was consistently twice as high as among former and never smokers.

Discussion

Public health efforts aimed at decreasing the prevalence of smoking should take depression into account, a common and modifiable barrier whose treatment may help to increase successful smoking cessation. Future work is needed to disentangle the role of smoking and other factors that lead to increases in depression in the US population.

Sex Differences in Microglia Activity within the Periaqueductal Gray of the Rat: A Potential Mechanism Driving the Dimorphic Effects of Morphine

H.H. Doyle, L.N. Eidson, D.M. Sinkiewicz and A.Z. Murphy

Journal of Neuroscience 20 February 2017, 2906-16;

Abstract:

 Although morphine remains the primary drug prescribed for alleviation of severe or persistent pain, both preclinical and clinical studies have shown that females require 2-3 times more morphine than males to produce comparable levels of analgesia. In addition to binding to the neuronal  opioid receptor (MOR), morphine binds to the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) localized primarily on microglia. Morphine action at TLR4 initiates a neuroinflammatory response that directly opposes the analgesic effects of morphine. Here we test the hypothesis that the attenuated response to morphine observed in females is the result of increased microglia activation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a central locus mediating the antinociceptive effects of morphine. We report that while no overall sex differences in the density of microglia were noted within the PAG of male or female rats, microglia exhibited a more activated phenotype in females at baseline, with the degree of activation a significant predictor of morphine ED50 values. Priming microglia with LPS induced greater microglia activation in the PAG of females compared with males that was accompanied by increased transcription levels of IL-1 and a significant rightward shift in the morphine dose response curve. Blockade of morphine binding to PAG TLR4 with (+)-naloxone significantly potentiated morphine antinociception in females such that no sex differences in ED50 were observed. These results demonstrate that PAG microglia are sexually dimorphic in both basal and LPS-induced activation, and contribute to the sexually dimorphic effects of morphine in the rat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi

Thanks for helping out with this AMA. This is a very interesting topic indeed!

I have two questions:

1. What has been the most unusual case your team has had to solve? 

2. What is the role of artificial intelligence in this space? I am aware that IBM Watson has just been launched in Germany in a similar area of unknown diseases with apparently some success. Are there plans for your team to do something similar?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Abstract

 A megaslump at Batagaika, in northern Yakutia, exposes a remarkable stratigraphic sequence of permafrost deposits ~5080 m thick. To determine their potential for answering key questions about Quaternary environmental and climatic change in northeast Siberia, we carried out a reconnaissance study of their cryostratigraphy and paleoecology, supported by four rangefinder 14C ages. The sequence includes two ice complexes separated by a unit of fine sand containing narrow syngenetic ice wedges and multiple paleosols. Overall, the sequence developed as permafrost grew syngenetically through an eolian sand sheet aggrading on a hillslope. Wood remains occur in two forest beds, each associated with a reddened weathering horizon. The lower bed contains high amounts of Larix pollen (20%), plus small amounts of Picea and Pinus pumila, and is attributed to interglacial conditions. Pollen from the overlying sequence is dominated by herbaceous taxa (~70%80%) attributed to an open tundra landscape during interstadial climatic conditions. Of three hypothetical age schemes considered, we tentatively attribute much of the Batagaika sequence to Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The upper and lower forest beds may represent a midMIS 3 optimum and MIS 5, respectively, although we cannot discount alternative attributions to MIS 5 and 7. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker is the quintessential game of imperfect information, and a longstanding challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated with statistical significance professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas holdem. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce more difficult to exploit strategies than prior approaches. </TEXT>

Probiotics (Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13, Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1, and Bifidobacterium longum MM-2) improve rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life in individuals with seasonal allergies: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial

First published February 22, 2017

Abstract

 Background: Rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life is often reduced during seasonal allergies. The Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MRQLQ) is a validated tool used to measure quality of life in people experiencing allergies (0 = not troubled to 6 = extremely troubled). Probiotics may improve quality of life during allergy season by increasing the percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inducing tolerance.

 Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether consuming Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13, Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1, and B. longum MM-2 compared with placebo would result in beneficial effects on MRQLQ scores throughout allergy season in individuals who typically experience seasonal allergies. Secondary outcomes included changes in immune markers as part of a potential mechanism for changes in MRQLQ scores.

 Design: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomized clinical trial, 173 participants (mean  SEM: age 27  1 y) who self-identified as having seasonal allergies received either a probiotic (2 capsules/d, 1.5 billion colony-forming units/capsule) or placebo during spring allergy season for 8 wk. MRQLQ scores were collected weekly throughout the study. Fasting blood samples were taken from a subgroup (placebo, n = 37; probiotic, n = 35) at baseline and week 6 (predicted peak of pollen) to determine serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E concentrations and Treg percentages.

 Results: The probiotic group reported an improvement in the MRQLQ global score from baseline to pollen peak (0.68  0.13) when compared with the placebo group (0.19  0.14; P = 0.0092). Both serum total IgE and the percentage of Tregs increased from baseline to week 6, but changes were not different between groups.

 Conclusions: This combination probiotic improved rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life during allergy season for healthy individuals with self-reported seasonal allergies; however, the associated mechanism is still unclear. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02349711. </TEXT>

Adiposity and cancer at major anatomical sites: umbrella review of the literature

BMJ 2017; 356 

doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j477 

(Published 28 February 2017)

Abstract:

 Objective To evaluate the strength and validity of the evidence for the association between adiposity and risk of developing or dying from cancer.

 Design Umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

 Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and manual screening of retrieved references.

 Eligibility criteria Systematic reviews or meta-analyses of observational studies that evaluated the association between indices of adiposity and risk of developing or dying from cancer.

 Data synthesis Primary analysis focused on cohort studies exploring associations for continuous measures of adiposity. The evidence was graded into strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, or weak after applying criteria that included the statistical significance of the random effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of cancer cases, heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction intervals, small study effects, excess significance bias, and sensitivity analysis with credibility ceilings.

 Results 204 meta-analyses investigated associations between seven indices of adiposity and developing or dying from 36 primary cancers and their subtypes. Of the 95 meta-analyses that included cohort studies and used a continuous scale to measure adiposity, only 12 (13%) associations for nine cancers were supported by strong evidence. An increase in body mass index was associated with a higher risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma; colon and rectal cancer in men; biliary tract system and pancreatic cancer; endometrial cancer in premenopausal women; kidney cancer; and multiple myeloma. Weight gain and waist to hip circumference ratio were associated with higher risks of postmenopausal breast cancer in women who have never used hormone replacement therapy and endometrial cancer, respectively. The increase in the risk of developing cancer for every 5 kg/m2 increase in body mass index ranged from 9% (relative risk 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.13) for rectal cancer among men to 56% (1.56, 1.34 to 1.81) for biliary tract system cancer. The risk of postmenopausal breast cancer among women who have never used HRT increased by 11% for each 5 kg of weight gain in adulthood (1.11, 1.09 to 1.13), and the risk of endometrial cancer increased by 21% for each 0.1 increase in waist to hip ratio (1.21, 1.13 to 1.29). Five additional associations were supported by strong evidence when categorical measures of adiposity were included: weight gain with colorectal cancer; body mass index with gallbladder, gastric cardia, and ovarian cancer; and multiple myeloma mortality.

 Conclusions Although the association of adiposity with cancer risk has been extensively studied, associations for only 11 cancers (oesophageal adenocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the gastric cardia, colon, rectum, biliary tract system, pancreas, breast, endometrium, ovary, and kidney) were supported by strong evidence. Other associations could be genuine, but substantial uncertainty remains. Obesity is becoming one of the biggest problems in public health; evidence on the strength of the associated risks may allow finer selection of those at higher risk of cancer, who could be targeted for personalised prevention strategies. </TEXT>

Medical cannabis access, use, and substitution for prescription opioids and other substances: A survey of authorized medical cannabis patients

Published Online: February 10, 2017

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2017.01.011

Link:

Abstract

 Background

 In 2014 Health Canada replaced the Marihuana for Medical Access Regulations (MMAR) with the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR). One of the primary changes in the new program has been to move from a single Licensed Producer (LP) of cannabis to multiple Licensed Producers. This is the first comprehensive survey of patients enrolled in the MMPR.

 Methods

 Patients registered to purchase cannabis from Tilray, a federally authorized Licenced Producer (LP) within the MMPR, were invited to complete an online survey consisting of 107 questions on demographics, patterns of use, and cannabis substitution effect. The survey was completed by 271 respondents.

 Results

 Cannabis is perceived to be an effective treatment for diverse conditions, with pain and mental health the most prominent. Findings include high self-reported use of cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs (63%), particularly pharmaceutical opioids (30%), benzodiazepines (16%), and antidepressants (12%). Patients also reported substituting cannabis for alcohol (25%), cigarettes/tobacco (12%), and illicit drugs (3%). A significant percentage of patients (42%) reported accessing cannabis from illegal/unregulated sources in addition to access via LPs, and over half (55%) were charged to receive a medical recommendation to use cannabis, with nearly 25% paying $300 or more.

 Conclusion

 The finding that patients report its use as a substitute for prescription drugs supports prior research on medical cannabis users; however, this study is the first to specify the classes of prescription drugs for which cannabis it is used as a substitute, and to match this substitution to specific diagnostic categories. The findings that some authorized patients purchase cannabis from unregulated sources and that a significant percentage of patients were charged for medical cannabis recommendations highlight ongoing policy challenges for this federal program. </TEXT>

Of interest, from here:
http://news.ubc.ca/2015/03/16/universal-public-drug-coverage-would-save-canada-billions/

 Canada is the only developed country with a universal health care system that does not include prescription drug coverage.

Australia and the U.K. on the other hand provide a universal pharmaceutical funding system. So it clearly does work in the real world. In Australia which I am most familiar the system subsidizes the essential medicines. Which is in place in some form or another in most countries actually.  </TEXT>

Estimated effects of adding universal public coverage of an essential medicines list to existing public drug plans in Canada

Steven G. Morgan PhD, Winny Li MSc, Brandon Yau BSc, Nav Persaud MD MSc

CMAJ 2017 February 27;189:E295302.

Abstract:

 BACKGROUND: Canadas universal health care system does not include uni versal coverage of prescription drugs. We sought to estimate the effects of adding universal public coverage of an essential medicines list to existing pub lic drug plans in Canada.

 METHODS: We used administrative and market research data to estimate the 2015 shares of the volume and cost of prescriptions filled in the community setting that were for 117 drugs on a model list of essential medicines for Canada. We compared prices of these essential medicines in Canada with prices in the United States, Sweden and New Zealand. We estimated the cost of adding universal public drug coverage of these essential medicines based on anticipated effects on medication use and pricing.

 RESULTS: The 117 essential medicines on the model list accounted for 44% of all prescriptions and 30% of total prescription drug expenditures in 2015. Average prices of generic essential medicines were 47% lower in the US, 60% lower in Sweden and 84% lower in New Zealand; brandname drugs were priced 43% lower in the US. Esti mated savings from universal public coverage of these essential medicines was $4.27 billion per year (range $2.72 billion to $5.83 billion; 28% reduction) for patients and private drug plan sponsors, at an incremental government cost of $1.23 billion per year (range $373 million to $1.98 bil lion; 11% reduction).

 INTERPRETATION: Our analysis showed that adding universal public coverage of essential medicines to the existing pub lic drug plans in Canada could address most of Canadians pharmaceutical needs and save billions of dollars annu ally. Doing so may be a pragmatic step forward while more comprehensive pharmacare reforms are planned.

<TEXT> Hi

Thanks for agreeing to do this AMA!

As we learn more about the effects of simple sugars on our metabolism potentially leading to obesity and diabetes, and as governments consider increasing regulation and taxation, as well as restricting advertising, do you think that sugar will one day become the new "smoking", and be ultimately relegated to something seen as unhealthy and stigmatized, that only a minority of people partake in? Or will we always enjoy our desserts and sweets?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to restore communication for people with tetraplegia and anarthria by translating neural activity into control signals for assistive communication devices. While previous pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated promising proofs-of-concept (Serruya et al., 2002; Simeral et al., 2011; Bacher et al., 2015; Nuyujukian et al., 2015; Aflalo et al., 2015; Gilja et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015; Wolpaw et al., 1998; Hwang et al., 2012; Spler et al., 2012; Leuthardt et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2002; Schalk et al., 2008; Moran, 2010; Brunner et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Townsend and Platsko, 2016; Vansteensel et al., 2016; Nuyujukian et al., 2016; Carmena et al., 2003; Musallam et al., 2004; Santhanam et al., 2006; Hochberg et al., 2006; Ganguly et al., 2011; ODoherty et al., 2011; Gilja et al., 2012), the performance of human clinical BCI systems is not yet high enough to support widespread adoption by people with physical limitations of speech. Here we report a high-performance intracortical BCI (iBCI) for communication, which was tested by three clinical trial participants with paralysis. The system leveraged advances in decoder design developed in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies (Gilja et al., 2015; Kao et al., 2016; Gilja et al., 2012). For all three participants, performance exceeded previous iBCIs (Bacher et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015) as measured by typing rate (by a factor of 1.44.2) and information throughput (by a factor of 2.24.0). This high level of performance demonstrates the potential utility of iBCIs as powerful assistive communication devices for people with limited motor function.

Smoke signals: The decline of brand identity predicts reduced smoking behaviour following the introduction of plain packaging

Abstract:

 This study tests a social identity based mechanism for the effectiveness of plain tobacco packaging legislation, introduced in Australia in December 2012, to reduce cigarette smoking. 178 Australian smokers rated their sense of identification with fellow smokers of their brand, positive brand stereotypes, quitting behaviours and intentions, and smoking intensity, both before and seven months after the policy change. Mediation analyses showed that smokers, especially those who initially identified strongly with their brand, experienced a significant decrease in their brand identity following the introduction of plain packaging and this was associated with lower smoking behaviours and increased intentions to quit. The findings provide the first quantitative evidence that brand identities may help maintain smoking behaviour, and suggest the role of social-psychological processes in the effectiveness of public health policy.

Clonal reversal of ageing-associated stem cell lineage bias via a pluripotent intermediate
Martin Wahlestedt, Eva Erlandsson[]David Bryder

Nature Communications 8, Article number: 14533 (2017)

doi:10.1038/ncomms14533

Published online: 22 February 2017

http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14533

Abstract:

 Ageing associates with significant alterations in somatic/adult stem cells and therapies to counteract these might have profound benefits for health. In the blood, haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) ageing is linked to several functional shortcomings. However, besides the recent realization that individual HSCs might be preset differentially already from young age, HSCs might also age asynchronously. Evaluating the prospects for HSC rejuvenation therefore ultimately requires approaching those HSCs that are functionally affected by age. Here we combine genetic barcoding of aged murine HSCs with the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. This allows us to specifically focus on aged HSCs presenting with a pronounced lineage skewing, a hallmark of HSC ageing. Functional and molecular evaluations reveal haematopoiesis from these iPS clones to be indistinguishable from that associating with young mice. Our data thereby provide direct support to the notion that several key functional attributes of HSC ageing can be reversed. </TEXT>

Alveolar Macrophages Prevent Lethal Influenza Pneumonia By Inhibiting Infection Of Type-1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells.

Abstract:

 The Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen that produces significant morbidity and mortality. To explore the contribution of alveolar macrophages (AlvMs) in regulating the severity of IAV infection we employed a murine model in which the Core Binding Factor Beta gene is conditionally disrupted in myeloid cells. These mice exhibit a selective deficiency in AlvMs. Following IAV infection these AlvM deficient mice developed severe diffuse alveolar damage, lethal respiratory compromise, and consequent lethality. Lethal injury in these mice resulted from increased infection of their Type-1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells (T1AECs) and the subsequent elimination of the infected T1AECs by the adaptive immune T cell response. Further analysis indicated AlvM-mediated suppression of the cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) pathway genes in T1AECs in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of the cysLT pathway enzymes in a T1AECs cell line reduced the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection, suggesting that AlvM-mediated suppression of this pathway contributes to the resistance of T1AECs to IAV infection. Furthermore, inhibition of the cysLT pathway enzymes, as well as blockade of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptors in the AlvM deficient mice reduced the susceptibility of their T1AECs to IAV infection and protected these mice from lethal infection. These results suggest that AlvMs may utilize a previously unappreciated mechanism to protect T1AECs against IAV infection, and thereby reduce the severity of infection. The findings further suggest that the cysLT pathway and the receptors for cysLT metabolites represent potential therapeutic targets in severe IAV infection. </TEXT>

Maternal Immunoreactivity to Herpes Simplex Virus 2 and Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Male Offspring

DOI: 10.1128/mSphere.00016-17

Full text link:
http://msphere.asm.org/content/2/1/e00016-17

Abstract:

 Maternal infections during pregnancy are associated with risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Proposed pathogenetic mechanisms include fetal infection, placental inflammation, and maternal cytokines or antibodies that cross the placenta. The Autism Birth Cohort comprises mothers, fathers, and offspring recruited in Norway in 1999 to 2008. Through questionnaire screening, referrals, and linkages to a national patient registry, 442 mothers of children with ASD were identified, and 464 frequency-matched controls were selected. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and HSV-2 in plasma collected at midpregnancy and after delivery were measured by multiplexed immunoassays. High levels of HSV-2 IgG antibodies in maternal midpregnancy plasma were associated with increased risk of ASD in male offspring (an increase in HSV-2 IgG levels from 240 to 640 arbitrary units/ml was associated with an odds ratio of 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 4.06; P = 0.03) when adjusted for parity and childs birth year. No association was found between ASD and the presence of IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, CMV, or HSV-1. Additional studies are needed to test for replicability of risk and specificity of the sex effect and to examine risk associated with other infections. </TEXT>

Discovery of Novel Antimicrobial Peptides from Varanus komodoensis (Komodo dragon) by Large Scale Analyses and De Novo-Assisted Sequencing using Electron Transfer Dissociation Mass Spectrometry. 

Journal of Proteome Research, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00857

Link:
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00857

Abstract:

 Komodo dragons are the largest living lizards and are the apex predators in their environs. They endure numerous strains of pathogenic bacteria in their saliva and recover from wounds inflicted by other dragons, reflecting the inherent robustness of their innate immune defense. We have employed a custom bioprospecting approach combining partial de novo peptide sequencing with transcriptome assembly to identify cationic antimicrobial peptides from Komodo dragon plasma. Through these analyses, we identified 48 novel potential cationic antimicrobial peptides. All but one of the identified peptides were derived from histone proteins. The antimicrobial effectiveness of eight of these peptides was evaluated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), with seven peptides exhibiting antimicrobial activity against both microbes, and one only showing significant potency against P. aeruginosa. This study demonstrates the power and promise of our bioprospecting approach to cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) discovery and it reveals the presence of a plethora of novel histone-derived antimicrobial peptides in the plasma of the Komodo dragon. These findings may have broader implications regarding the role that intact histones and histone-derived peptides play in defending the host from infection. Data are available via ProteomeXChange with identifier PXD005043. </TEXT>

Discovery of Novel Antimicrobial Peptides from Varanus komodoensis (Komodo dragon) by Large Scale Analyses and De Novo-Assisted Sequencing using Electron Transfer Dissociation Mass Spectrometry. 

Journal of Proteome Research, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00857

Abstract:

 Komodo dragons are the largest living lizards and are the apex predators in their environs. They endure numerous strains of pathogenic bacteria in their saliva and recover from wounds inflicted by other dragons, reflecting the inherent robustness of their innate immune defense. We have employed a custom bioprospecting approach combining partial de novo peptide sequencing with transcriptome assembly to identify cationic antimicrobial peptides from Komodo dragon plasma. Through these analyses, we identified 48 novel potential cationic antimicrobial peptides. All but one of the identified peptides were derived from histone proteins. The antimicrobial effectiveness of eight of these peptides was evaluated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), with seven peptides exhibiting antimicrobial activity against both microbes, and one only showing significant potency against P. aeruginosa. This study demonstrates the power and promise of our bioprospecting approach to cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) discovery and it reveals the presence of a plethora of novel histone-derived antimicrobial peptides in the plasma of the Komodo dragon. These findings may have broader implications regarding the role that intact histones and histone-derived peptides play in defending the host from infection. Data are available via ProteomeXChange with identifier PXD005043. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi

Thanks for giving us your time and helping us out with this AMA.

Since your title refers to the economy and environment, I will ask a question for each topic.

1. Economy - once all cars become autonomous, do you believe that people will no longer need to own cars - that they will be generic devices, like elevators, that you just call when needed? If so, what would happen to the professional drivers displaced, especially truck drivers, bus drivers etc.?

2. Environment - there is ongoing debate that self-driving cars, that tend to be electric, actually are actually negative for the environment, due to the cost of manufacture and the need to have batteries made and disposed of. Any comment about this? Ultimately I think it will be about improving battery efficiency and technology, but interested in your thoughts.

That's it for now, thanks for participating! </TEXT>

Rapid Integration of Artificial Sensory Feedback during Operant Conditioning of Motor Cortex Neurons

Neuron, Volume 93, Issue 4, p929939.e6, 22 February 2017

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.01.023

Summary

 Neuronal motor commands, whether generating real or neuroprosthetic movements, are shaped by ongoing sensory feedback from the displacement being produced. Here we asked if cortical stimulation could provide artificial feedback during operant conditioning of cortical neurons. Simultaneous two-photon imaging and real-time optogenetic stimulation were used to train mice to activate a single neuron in motor cortex (M1), while continuous feedback of its activity level was provided by proportionally stimulating somatosensory cortex. This artificial signal was necessary to rapidly learn to increase the conditioned activity, detect correct performance, and maintain the learned behavior. Population imaging in M1 revealed that learning-related activity changes are observed in the conditioned cell only, which highlights the functional potential of individual neurons in the neocortex. Our findings demonstrate the capacity of animals to use an artificially induced cortical channel in a behaviorally relevant way and reveal the remarkable speed and specificity at which this can occur. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Peter, Damien and Ian

Thanks for doing this AMA!

Solar specifically, and renewable energy in general, is the way of the future.

I thought I would get your views on a few thoughts:

1. Elon Musk's solar roof tiles - is it as amazing as he promises when he launched it, in terms of efficiency and cost? 

2. Transparent solar panels that double as windows - there has been some recent developments - any updates to whether this is possible?

3. Solar roads - trials in France and the US have started - is this practical?

4. Solar powered grid/ solar farms - there has been significant developments in the Middle East, Russia, China, India, and Australia - is this the future? Is our battery technology sufficiently advance enough to support this? 

Thanks in advance for entertaining my random questions. Keep up the good work! </TEXT>

Future life expectancy in 35 industrialised countries: projections with a Bayesian model ensemble

Published: 21 February 2017

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)32381-9

Summary:

 Background
 Projections of future mortality and life expectancy are needed to plan for health and social services and pensions. Our aim was to forecast national age-specific mortality and life expectancy using an approach that takes into account the uncertainty related to the choice of forecasting model.

 Methods
 We developed an ensemble of 21 forecasting models, all of which probabilistically contributed towards the final projections. We applied this approach to project age-specific mortality to 2030 in 35 industrialised countries with high-quality vital statistics data. We used age-specific death rates to calculate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 years, and probability of dying before age 70 years, with life table methods.

 Findings
 Life expectancy is projected to increase in all 35 countries with a probability of at least 65% for women and 85% for men. There is a 90% probability that life expectancy at birth among South Korean women in 2030 will be higher than 867 years, the same as the highest worldwide life expectancy in 2012, and a 57% probability that it will be higher than 90 years. Projected female life expectancy in South Korea is followed by those in France, Spain, and Japan. There is a greater than 95% probability that life expectancy at birth among men in South Korea, Australia, and Switzerland will surpass 80 years in 2030, and a greater than 27% probability that it will surpass 85 years. Of the countries studied, the USA, Japan, Sweden, Greece, Macedonia, and Serbia have some of the lowest projected life expectancy gains for both men and women. The female life expectancy advantage over men is likely to shrink by 2030 in every country except Mexico, where female life expectancy is predicted to increase more than male life expectancy, and in Chile, France, and Greece where the two sexes will see similar gains. More than half of the projected gains in life expectancy at birth in women will be due to enhanced longevity above age 65 years.

 Interpretation
 There is more than a 50% probability that by 2030, national female life expectancy will break the 90 year barrier, a level that was deemed unattainable by some at the turn of the 21st century. Our projections show continued increases in longevity, and the need for careful planning for health and social services and pensions.

This section in the paper about the US is notable:

 The USA has the highest child and maternal mortality, homicide rate, and body-mass index of any high-income country, and was the first of high-income countries to experience a halt or possibly reversal of increase in height in adulthood, which is associated with higher longevity.20, 21, 28, 29, 30 The USA is also the only country in the OECD without universal health coverage, and has the largest share of unmet health-care needs due to financial costs.25 Not only does the USA have high and rising health inequalities, but also life expectancy has stagnated or even declined in some population subgroups.1, 2 Therefore, the poor recent and projected US performance is at least partly due to high and inequitable mortality from chronic diseases and violence, and insufficient and inequitable health care.

<TEXT> The mods have come up with some guidelines around UBI posts in this sub.

In general, there are 2 types of UBI posts:

a) UBI posts that discusses the economics and societal implications of implementing UBI, such as poverty, taxation, employment etc.

b) UBI posts that discusses the need to address automation, rise of robots, technology.

Type (a) posts will be removed as they are considered Rule 2 breaches.

Type (b) posts will be allowed, as they refer to the impact of technology, automation and robots. 

Hope the above helps posters and commenters. </TEXT>

Mobile attachment: Separation from the mobile phone induces physiological and behavioural stress and attentional bias to separation-related stimuli
Veronika Konokkos Pognydm Miklsi

Computers in Human Behavior
June 2017, Vol.71:228239, doi:10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.002

Abstract:

 Humans have a biological predisposition to form attachment to social partners. This attachment, however, is not restricted to humans: non-human and inanimate targets are often involved. People are increasingly engaged with their mobiles but whether their behaviour toward these devices can be regarded as an attachment behaviour has not yet been experimentally tested.

 Here we hypothesized the existence of mobile attachment. We expected people to seek the proximity of the mobile and give stress response upon separation from it, which manifests both at behavioural and physiological level. We also predicted that separation from the mobile should induce specific separation-related emotions, which leads to increased attention to separation-related stimuli. We applied a version of the Strange Situation Test using a mobile phone, with behavioural, physiological, cognitive and self-report measures, and the emotional Stroop test. Additionally, we constructed a questionnaire to self-assess mobile attachment.

 Separation from the mobile induced behavioural and physiological stress, proximity seeking behaviour, and an attentional bias to separation-related stimuli for participants with higher mobile attachment. These effects were only observable when no other mobile was present. According to the questionnaire, secure base and safe haven are also relevant aspects of attachment to a mobile.

 These results support that humans form attachment toward their mobile which is similar to social attachment. This could emerge by cultural recycling of the attachment system's evolutionary structures. </TEXT>

Long-term Outcomes After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis

JAMA Neurol. Published online February 20, 2017. doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.5867

Abstract

 Importance  Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) may be effective in aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) that fail to respond to standard therapies.

 Objective  To evaluate the long-term outcomes in patients who underwent AHSCT for the treatment of MS in a large multicenter cohort.

 Design, Setting, and Participants  Data were obtained in a multicenter, observational, retrospective cohort study. Eligibility criteria were receipt of AHSCT for the treatment of MS between January 1995 and December 2006 and the availability of a prespecified minimum data set comprising the disease subtype at baseline; the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline; information on the administered conditioning regimen and graft manipulation; and at least 1 follow-up visit or report after transplant. The last patient visit was on July 1, 2012. To avoid bias, all eligible patients were included in the analysis regardless of their duration of follow-up. Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2014 to April 27, 2015.

 Exposures  Demographic, disease-related, and treatment-related exposures were considered variables of interest, including age, disease subtype, baseline EDSS score, number of previous disease-modifying treatments, and intensity of the conditioning regimen.

 Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcomes were MS progression-free survival and overall survival. The probabilities of progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis models.

 Results  Valid data were obtained from 25 centers in 13 countries for 281 evaluable patients, with median follow-up of 6.6 years (range, 0.2-16 years). Seventy-eight percent (218 of 281) of patients had progressive forms of MS. The median EDSS score before mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells was 6.5 (range, 1.5-9). Eight deaths (2.8%; 95% CI, 1.0%-4.9%) were reported within 100 days of transplant and were considered transplant-related mortality. The 5-year probability of progression-free survival as assessed by the EDSS score was 46% (95% CI, 42%-54%), and overall survival was 93% (95% CI, 89%-96%) at 5 years. Factors associated with neurological progression after transplant were older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05), progressive vs relapsing form of MS (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.27-4.28), and more than 2 previous disease-modifying therapies (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.10-2.47). Higher baseline EDSS score was associated with worse overall survival (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.40-2.95).

 Conclusions and Relevance  In this observational study of patients with MS treated with AHSCT, almost half of them remained free from neurological progression for 5 years after transplant. Younger age, relapsing form of MS, fewer prior immunotherapies, and lower baseline EDSS score were factors associated with better outcomes. The results support the rationale for further randomized clinical trials of AHSCT for the treatment of MS. </TEXT>

Prevalence and architecture of de novo mutations in developmental disorders

Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study

Nature (2017) doi:10.1038/nature21062

Published online 25 January 2017

Homepage to the study: https://www.ddduk.org/

Link to article: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature21062.html

Abstract

 The genomes of individuals with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders are enriched in damaging de novo mutations (DNMs) in developmentally important genes. Here we have sequenced the exomes of 4,293 families containing individuals with developmental disorders, and meta-analysed these data with data from another 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most important factors influencing the diagnostic yield of DNMs are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents, whether close relatives are affected and the parental ages. We identified 94 genes enriched in damaging DNMs, including 14 that previously lacked compelling evidence of involvement in developmental disorders. We have also characterized the phenotypic diversity among these disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs in coding sequences; approximately half of these DNMs disrupt gene function and the remainder result in altered protein function. We estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 births, depending on parental age. Given current global demographics, this equates to almost 400,000 children born per year. </TEXT>

Online trolling: The case of Madeleine McCann

Abstract

 Despite the sustained media attention surrounding internet trolling, academic studies investigating its occurrence are rare. This study aimed to provide a case study analysis of the behaviours and strategies of a group of alleged Twitter trolls referred to as the anti-McCanns due to their continual abuse of Kate and Gerry McCann as well as those who support them and thus identify as pro-McCann. The way in which language was used to construct the anti-McCanns group identity, enhance in-group cohesion and facilitate out-group disassociation from the pro-Mccann group was additionally explored, given that previous research has implicated group processes in the propagation of aggressive online conduct. A multi-method approach involving a combination of ethnographic observations and the collection of online commentary was employed. The data was then analysed using quantitative content analysis and discourse analysis, which indicated that language was utilised in a variety of ways by the anti-McCanns to construct a salient group identity and negatively stereotype and disassociate from the pro-McCann group. Findings additionally revealed that several strategies were employed by the anti-McCann trolls to provoke and derogate members of the pro-McCann group, supporting previous findings which have linked trolling to both western media culture and the characteristics of anti-social personality disorder. The implications of these findings both theoretical and practical are discussed, alongside recommendations for future research. </TEXT>

People have thought the same of Apple for example. Such speculation can be posted in another sub but this is not a futurology topic. Hope this helps.  </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Compassion is deeply prized in Western marriages yet its benefits for emotional well-being have been investigated empirically only rarely. This research examined the association between compassionate acts and everyday emotional well-being in 175 newlywed couples. Following prior research and theory, we defined compassionate acts as caregiving that is freely given, focused on understanding and genuine acceptance of the others needs and wishes, and expressed through openness, warmth, and a willingness to put a partners goals ahead of ones own. We adopted an explicitly dyadic perspective so that we could consider how compassionate acts as well as their recognition influence the affective state of both donors and recipients. Our findings, which controlled for the general affective tone of marital interaction, revealed that compassionate acts are beneficial for both donors and recipients, and that the effects on the donor are stronger than the effects on the recipient. Moreover, we found that whereas recipients benefits depend on their noticing the donors actions, donors benefit regardless of whether the recipients explicitly notice the compassionate acts. The pattern of results for husbands and wives was very similar. These results suggest that in terms of emotional well-being, for donors, acting compassionately may be its own reward.

National Trends in the Prevalence and Treatment of Depression in Adolescents and Young Adults

Abstract

 OBJECTIVES: This study examined national trends in 12-month prevalence of major depressive episodes (MDEs) in adolescents and young adults overall and in different sociodemographic groups, as well as trends in depression treatment between 2005 and 2014.

 METHODS: Data were drawn from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health for 2005 to 2014, which are annual cross-sectional surveys of the US general population. Participants included 172495 adolescents aged 12 to 17 and 178755 adults aged 18 to 25. Time trends in 12-month prevalence of MDEs were examined overall and in different subgroups, as were time trends in the use of treatment services.

 RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence of MDEs increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 in adolescents and from 8.8% to 9.6% in young adults (both P  .001). The increase was larger and statistically significant only in the age range of 12 to 20 years. The trends remained significant after adjustment for substance use disorders and sociodemographic factors. Mental health care contacts overall did not change over time; however, the use of specialty mental health providers increased in adolescents and young adults, and the use of prescription medications and inpatient hospitalizations increased in adolescents.

 CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression in adolescents and young adults has increased in recent years. In the context of little change in mental health treatments, trends in prevalence translate into a growing number of young people with untreated depression. The findings call for renewed efforts to expand service capacity to best meet the mental health care needs of this age group. </TEXT>

Cultural influence of social information use in pedestrian road-crossing behaviours

Abstract

 Social information use is common in a wide range of group-living animals, notably in humans. The role it plays in decision-making could be a key to understanding how social groups make collective decisions. The observation of road-crossing behaviours in the presence of other individuals is an ideal means to study the influence of social information on decision-making. This study investigated the influence of culture on social information used by pedestrians in a potentially dangerous scenario, namely road crossing. We scored the collective crossing of pedestrians at four locations in Nagoya (Japan) and three locations in Strasbourg (France). French pedestrians cross against the lights much more often (41.9%) than Japanese ones (2.1%). Individuals deciding to cross the road were strongly influenced by the behaviour and the presence of other pedestrians, especially in Japan, where a stronger conformism was noted. However, Japanese pedestrians were half as likely to be influenced by social information as their French counterparts when crossing at the red light, as they were more respectful of rules. Men show riskier behaviour than women (40.6% versus 25.7% of rule-breaking, respectively), deciding quickly and setting off earlier than women. Further related studies could help target specific preventive, culture-specific solutions for pedestrian safety. </TEXT>

Abstract

 Background: The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels. A few small-scale interventions with a single antioxidant have improved some HDL functions. However, to date, no long-term, large-scale, randomized controlled trial has been conducted to assess the effects of an antioxidant-rich dietary pattern (such as a traditional Mediterranean diet [TMD]) on HDL function in humans.

 Methods: This study was performed in a random subsample of volunteers from the PREDIMED Study (Prevencin con Dieta Mediterrnea; n=296) after a 1-year intervention. We compared the effects of 2 TMDs, one enriched with virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; n=100) and the other enriched with nuts (TMD-Nuts; n=100), with respect to a low-fat control diet (n=96). We assessed the effects of both TMDs on the role of HDL particles on reverse cholesterol transport (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity), HDL antioxidant properties (paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity and total HDL antioxidant capacity on low-density lipoproteins), and HDL vasodilatory capacity (HDL ability to induce the release of nitric oxide in endothelial cells). We also studied the effects of a TMD on several HDL quality-related characteristics (HDL particle oxidation, resistance against oxidative modification, main lipid and protein composition, and size distribution).

 Results: Both TMDs increased cholesterol efflux capacity relative to baseline (P=0.018 and P=0.013 for TMD-VOO and TMD-Nuts, respectively). The TMD-VOO intervention decreased cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity (relative to baseline, P=0.028) and increased HDL ability to esterify cholesterol, paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity, and HDL vasodilatory capacity (relative to control, P=0.039, P=0.012, and P=0.026, respectively). Adherence to a TMD induced these beneficial changes by improving HDL oxidative status and composition. The 3 diets increased the percentage of large HDL particles (relative to baseline, P0.001).

 Conclusions: The TMD, especially when enriched with virgin olive oil, improved HDL atheroprotective functions in humans. </TEXT>

Mechanisms of In Vivo Ribosome Maintenance Change in Response to Nutrient Signals.

Abstract

 Control of protein homeostasis is fundamental to the health and longevity of all organisms. Because the rate of protein synthesis by ribosomes is a central control point in this process, regulation, and maintenance of ribosome function could have amplified importance in the overall regulatory circuit. Indeed, ribosomal defects are commonly associated with loss of protein homeostasis, aging, and disease (14), whereas improved protein homeostasis, implying optimal ribosomal function, is associated with disease resistance and increased lifespan (57). To maintain a high-quality ribosome population within the cell, dysfunctional ribosomes are targeted for autophagic degradation. It is not known if complete degradation is the only mechanism for eukaryotic ribosome maintenance or if they might also be repaired by replacement of defective components. We used stable-isotope feeding and protein mass spectrometry to measure the kinetics of turnover of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 71 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) in mice. The results indicate that exchange of individual proteins and whole ribosome degradation both contribute to ribosome maintenance in vivo. In general, peripheral r-proteins and those with more direct roles in peptide-bond formation are replaced multiple times during the lifespan of the assembled structure, presumably by exchange with a free cytoplasmic pool, whereas the majority of r-proteins are stably incorporated for the lifetime of the ribosome. Dietary signals impact the rates of both new ribosome assembly and component exchange. Signal-specific modulation of ribosomal repair and degradation could provide a mechanistic link in the frequently observed associations among diminished rates of protein synthesis, increased autophagy, and greater longevity (5, 6, 8, 9).

<TEXT> Part of the problem is that the code I'm using for automod for this is not regex/wildcard - it only matches exact word and case. 

So AI will be picked up, but not AIs or Ai.

I did consider adding some regex search, but then it might pick up other words like ailing, or bailing if you know what I mean.

Happy for someone cleverer to add regex/wildcard to pick up singular/plural and variations of words without being too broad. </TEXT>

Pathways Between Self-Esteem and Depression in Couples.
Johnson, Matthew D.; Galambos, Nancy L.; Finn, Christine; Neyer, Franz J.; Horne, Rebecca M.

Developmental Psychology, Feb 06 , 2017
http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000276

http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-05289-001/

Abstract:

 Guided by concepts from a relational developmental perspective, this study examined intra- and interpersonal associations between self-esteem and depressive symptoms in a sample of 1,407 couples surveyed annually across 6 years in the Panel Analysis of Intimate Relations and Family Dynamics (pairfam) study. Autoregressive cross-lagged model results demonstrated that self-esteem predicted future depressive symptoms for male partners at all times, replicating the vulnerability model for men (low self-esteem is a risk factor for future depression). Additionally, a cross-partner association emerged between symptoms of depression: Higher depressive symptoms in one partner were associated with higher levels of depression in the other partner one year later. Finally, supportive dyadic coping, the support that partners reported providing to one another in times of stress, was tested as a potential interpersonal mediator of pathways between self-esteem and depression. Female partners higher initial levels of self-esteem predicted male partners subsequent reports of increased supportive dyadic coping, which, in turn, predicted higher self-esteem and fewer symptoms of depression among female partners in the future. Male partners initially higher symptoms of depression predicted less frequent supportive dyadic coping subsequently reported by female partners, which was associated with increased feelings of depression in the future. Couple relations represent an important contextual factor that may be implicated in the developmental pathways connecting self-esteem and symptoms of depression.

Learning the Structural Vocabulary of a Network

Abstract

 Networks have become instrumental in deciphering how information is processed and transferred within systems in almost every scientific field today. Nearly all network analyses, however, have relied on humans to devise structural features of networks believed to be most discriminative for an application. We present a framework for comparing and classifying networks without human-crafted features using deep learning. After training, autoencoders contain hidden units that encode a robust structural vocabulary for succinctly describing graphs. We use this feature vocabulary to tackle several network mining problems and find improved predictive performance versus many popular features used today. These problems include uncovering growth mechanisms driving the evolution of networks, predicting protein network fragility, and identifying environmental niches for metabolic networks. Deep learning offers a principled approach for mining complex networks and tackling graph-theoretic problems. </TEXT>

Virulence Inhibitors from Brazilian Peppertree Block Quorum Sensing and Abate Dermonecrosis in Skin Infection Models
Amelia Muhs, James T. Lyles[]Cassandra L. Quave
Scientific Reports 7, Article number: 42275 (2017)

Abstract:

 Widespread antibiotic resistance is on the rise and current therapies are becoming increasingly limited in both scope and efficacy. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represents a major contributor to this trend. Quorum sensing controlled virulence factors include secreted toxins responsible for extensive damage to host tissues and evasion of the immune system response; they are major contributors to morbidity and mortality. Investigation of botanical folk medicines for wounds and infections led us to study Schinus terebinthifolia (Brazilian Peppertree) as a potential source of virulence inhibitors. Here, we report the inhibitory activity of a flavone rich extract 430D-F5 against all S. aureus accessory gene regulator (agr) alleles in the absence of growth inhibition. Evidence for this activity is supported by its agr-quenching activity (IC50 232gmL1) in transcriptional reporters, direct protein outputs (-hemolysin and -toxin), and an in vivo skin challenge model. Importantly, 430D-F5 was well tolerated by human keratinocytes in cell culture and mouse skin in vivo; it also demonstrated significant reduction in dermonecrosis following skin challenge with a virulent strain of MRSA. This study provides an explanation for the anti-infective activity of peppertree remedies and yields insight into the potential utility of non-biocide virulence inhibitors in treating skin infections.

Fetal sex is associated with maternal stimulated cytokine production, but not serum cytokine levels, in human pregnancy

Brain, Behavior, and Immunity
Volume 60, February 2017, Pages 3237

Abstract

 Some studies suggest that fetal sex plays a role in maternal physiological processes during pregnancy including glycemic control, blood pressure, and cortisol regulation. However, data examining fetal sex-specific differences in maternal immune parameters is lacking. In the current study, serum levels of interleukin(IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor(TNF)- as well as LPS-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, and IL-1 by PBMCs incubated for 24 h were assessed in early, mid, and late pregnancy among 80 women (46 with male and 34 with female fetuses). Linear mixed models showed that women carrying females versus males exhibited greater stimulated production of IL-6 at each timepoint (ps  0.03), TNF- in early pregnancy (p = 0.04), and IL-1 in mid- and late pregnancy (ps  0.05). Despite changes in serum levels of IL-8 (p = 0.002) and TNF- (p  0.0001) across pregnancy, no differences in any serum cytokines were observed in relation to fetal sex (ps  0.85). In conclusion, in pregnant women, those carrying female versus male fetuses exhibited greater stimulated cytokine production across pregnancy. Differential inflammatory responses could affect maternal health and fetal development. Fetal sex should be considered as a factor in studies of maternal inflammation. These findings have relevance both clinically and conceptually. For example, maternal asthma is exacerbated among women carrying female versus male fetuses. In addition, data on associations between fetal sex and maternal immune function among women with health conditions (e.g., preeclampsia) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth) would be informative.
