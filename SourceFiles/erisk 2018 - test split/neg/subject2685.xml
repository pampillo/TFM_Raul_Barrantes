<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Looking to become a mobile developer without a CS degree.  I know ruby and python.  I know the hardest part is getting the foot in the door, and after doing some research I came up with **this plan:**

* Learn C# from microsoft's courses.

* Do the xamarin courses

* Make a bunch of hobby apps and build a portfolio.

* Apply for a mobile dev job.

**Does this sound reasonable or am I going about it all wrong?
I have plenty of drive and passion.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am advertising a youtube video.

I set it to a bunch of managed placements (6 youtube channels, one with 2 mil + subscribers)

Demographics are set to everyone in the world except the united States.

I have zero keywords as they were ineffective and being wasted on weird videos.

Why do I get zero impressions? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-03-18 00:10:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Everyone, there are rules for a reason.
Unfortunately, people seem to break the rules faster than the current mods (and even an aggressively tuned automoderator) can handle.
Because of this, the subreddit is locked until we can get more mods.

Remember, this was supposed to be a fanbase showing support, making art, and a gathering of similar interest.  This isn't supposed to be a game, or a witchhunt, or a scavenger hunt.  

**Like the rules say, don't post any videos that aren't already publicly up from Mars.  They aren't up for a reason**.  

We don't need to find more videos, we don't need to invade privacy, we simply need to enjoy artwork that is publicly given to us.  If this is not your intention in this subreddit, please leave or do not contribute to it. 

That said, as I haven't heard anything from Mars' wishes, this is how we can proceed further to make this community a more positive place: 

- ~~**We need more mods.** If you would like to moderate, please say so in the comments below.  *Experience would be preferred.*~~ We got the mods now

- **We need you, the community, to make art.**  We had some good tracings of good work, such as a birthday vid that was optioned.  Like many other fanbases and tumblrs, feel free to make gif's, memes, and other great stuff.

Again, don't mess this up for everyone.  The world is full of good people, don't let bad eggs ruin the whole community. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-12 21:11:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have this short code where I am trying to read and gsub every file in a directory.  But for some reason I can't use #{item} as a variable.  Here's the code:


   
    Dir.foreach('/Volumes/VIAL/Emily') do |item|
    IO.write("/Volumes/VIAL/Emily/#{item}.txt", File.open("/Volumes/VIAL/Emily/#{item}.txt") do |f|
             f.read.gsub(//, "")
             end
             )

    end


how do I use the variable "item" in here? keeps saying no directory and has a period instead of the filename.  Please help 3

Is there a sort of rescue operation I can do to make it automatically restart the app?  Also, I use xcode to run the app, then I have to select a gpx file to simulate GPS.  How can I get it to automatically do that when it restarts? </TEXT>

I see this SORTA exists in steps, for example, I know there are text to image scripts, but I want to know if there are any text to video scripts out there.  Also, if anyone has any advice in general on this.

We found that our last post was a bit outdated, [link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorGaming/comments/2c66ap/free_horror_games_a_masterpost/).  Please note that there are a TON of free horror games out there, but as you may know, many are poor quality, or clones.  This list was created with reviews in mind.  Additionally, the links are not always direct links to download; this was done so you can see descriptions, pictures, kickstarter campaigns, etc.  However, every linked page has either a direct, or one click away, to play.  Please enjoy, this list will be updated regularly as new games come out.

<TEXT> both.  game is "somewhat still encrypted" because even though they modders have unlocked it, there isn't a big community to share it so not everyone has access to the unlocked code.  Also, the mod community isn't organized well, and there isn't a guide for new modders to learn or build off of other's work, so every new modder is at square one.  Probably only 3-5 real modders but they have lives and are basically hanging on a thread due to lack of interest due to the games hate. </TEXT>

Not sure how hard it is to mod this, as i'm not a coder myself, but is this just changing around a few numbers on how ocean depth is created?

Why force your small team to add new features, when modders across the world could add features and shiz for free and much faster.  Open it up and save the game! </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah that's true, but waiting for the space anomaly gets annoying if you haven't gotten it yet.  And you'll have to keep making warp drives, and plus then you'll have to change your money making materials if you want to go back to space station trading.  Also depending on what version your using, pc/ps4/gog/experimental they may have patched the ability to keep going back to the same suit for upgrades so I didn't want to mention it.  If it's not patched in your version, sometimes you can go to the planet and come back to the space station and upgrade the suit again.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> GUIDE: How to Max Out your Exosuit and Ship Inventory Fast and FAIRLY. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-14 15:39:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Wanted to type this out, because the info is scattered.  This isn't exploiting the game, this is using knowledge wisely so you don't waste your real life time poorly.
This is the order you should do these things in, and before you start, make sure you have the bypass chip recipe.**
***


1) **First get a boatload of money.**  Do this by going to a space station in your star system.  Upon entering go through the right door (if the exit to space is behind you).  Go down the hall and check the galactic computer trade network on the wall and click "Sell Items." Look for what has a star next to it and keep note of it (Usually there's about 3 items that have stars next to them.  The star means they are willing to pay A LOT more than the average value for the item).  Especially keep note of items that are common and expensive, like Dynamic Resonators.  Ignore any weird rare trade items like daggers or relics.  **If suspension fluid is one of the starred items, do not touch, it's an exception in this case, go to another planetary system.**  Leave the terminal and go back to the ship dock area.  Clear out your suit inventory and ship inventory. When a person comes, buy those items starred items, no matter the price, and repeat until you fill your inventories.  Go back to the computer terminal and sell them for MAD PROFIT BRO.  At the beginning with basically no inventory upgrades, you can make like fuckin 1.5 mil every 30 minutes.  Fucking raining cash, it don't make no sense, pockets get heavy yo. If you change star systems, you can get a wall computer wanting different items.  *For advanced strategy, go to bottom of the post*

**Do this until you have about 2 mil**


***


2)  **Time to max out that exosuit.**
Go down to the planet.  The smaller the better.  Get a metric shit ton of plutonium and iron, which is easy to find.  Make a shit ton of bypass chips.  Fly til you find a signal beacon, which is easy to spot cause it's shooting a constant orange beam upwards for all the brothas and sistas to see.  Make sure the chip is in your exosuit inventory.  Use it on it, and click "shelter."  If it shows a shelter, ignore and do again.  If it shows a "Drop pod" do this til you have about 3 drop pod waypoints (any more than this and game gets weird and glitches.)  Go to each one, and spend money on the exosuit.  MAKE SURE YOU HIT THE SAVE FLAG EACH TIME, or else later a signal beacon may guide you back to it. Each time it adds a storage slot.  10k for the first, 20k for the second, 30k for third... until you max out.  The total cost is going to be about fucking 6 mil to fully upgrade to 48, but remember, with the 2.3 mil you made earlier, you can get to like the 30's of inventory slots, and when you go back to the trading port to trade, you can carry A LOT more per haul and make about 2-4 mil per half hour.  So don't worry bro.  Do this (step 1 again) until your exosuit it maxxed out (48 inventory slots).  Shouldn't be long to do this, this guide gotchu.


***


3)  **Now to get maxed out ship inventory.**  Go back to the trading port and do step 1 shit until you make about 2-3 mil.  Then, buy a ship that has above 24 slots.  Then, use the ship to fly back down to the planet.  Remember the bypass chips?  you need one or two again.  Aside from bypass chips, you don't need crack shit except those and plutonium/iron.
Find the orange signal beacons again, but this time choose "transmission."  You either will get an Observatory, beacon, or a Transmission Tower.  When you get a single transmission tower.  Go there and solve the code.  If you can't solve it [go here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4xindz/psa_how_to_solve_number_riddles_for_the_clueless/).  After you solve it, it'll either show you a path to a shelter or a "crashed ship."  IF AT A GEK TRANSMISSION TOWER DON'T GO THERE YET.  Simply hit the transmission tower computer again (they give you the same puzzle riddle code...smh...must be a mac..) and get more waypoints for crashed ship. (If you are using the GOG or experimental version on steam, or not at a gek transmission tower, it won't let you use it a second time and you'll have to find another transmission tower (thanks to /u/rj_riku and /u/momocorpo for this news)). DON'T GET MORE THAN 3 FOR THIS (because game gets glitchey and shit will be invisible.  like 4 real doe you will feel like u b trippin galaxy shit when you see the ship shadow but no ship).  Each time, the ship is most likely a 1 slot upgrade then your current .  Dismantle your ship parts, and swap the gear.  Only spend time repairing the pulse engines and launching gear.  Might want to unplug headphones cause if the shields are broken the alert is fucking annoying like wtf.  Then repeat this entire step until you hit 48 slots (the max).  The reason you bought a ship earlier is because this is time intensive and jumping from a 16 inventory ship to a 24 will save you a lot of time.


***

4)  **Now let's pimp this multitool to max**
 Almost same shit as Step 1. [Go down to the planet.  The smaller the better.  Get a metric shit ton of plutonium and iron, which is easy to find.  Make a shit ton of bypass chips.  Fly til you find a signal beacon, which is easy to spot cause it's shooting a constant orange beam upwards for all the brothas and sistas to see.  Make sure the chip is in your exosuit inventory.  Use it on it,] and click "transmission."  Ignore the results that show a transmission tower or observatory, and go to the ones that say "beacon."  This will lead you to an outpost or advanced life form, where the upgraded multitools can be bought. Max is 24 slots for this.

***
**TIPS/TROUBLESHOOTING BELOW**
***


**HOW TO SPEED THINGS UP:**  Travel a bit closer to the center of the galaxy.  This will cause trade ships to enter space ports for trading a lot more frequently.


**VISITING CRASHED SHIPS BUT THEY ARE SHITTIER THAN YOUR SHIP?**  Happens sometimes, there is a chance that the ship is 1+ better than yours, or 1- worse than yours.  Current community theory is that progressing/getting closer to the center of the galaxy increases your chances of it being better ships


**HOW TO GET ATLAS CARDS v1, v2, and v3:**  Atlas card v1 occurs randomly as a space anomly when flying between planets.  Using a signal beacon for "colonial outpost" is how you get atlas card v2 and/or v3.  When selecting "colonial outpost," you'll either get a colonial outpost or a manufactoring facility.  These manufacturing facilities need to be broken into, but they'll have blueprints which have a chance of being card v2 or card v3.    The atlas v3 can be used to open up v2 doors as well (thanks to /u/rj_riku for the info on this)


**TRANSMISSION TOWER NOT LETTING YOU REPEAT?** Seems it sometimes does not let you repeat usage of one computer.  From comments it seems like it is half patched depending on what version or console you use (pc/ps4/GOG/experimental) and [it may also only work on Gek Transmission towers.](https://m.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4xnv2k/psa_gek_transmission_terminals_are_glitched_in_a/)  In this case, best bet is to make a ton of bypass chips (which is easy, just plutonium and iron which is common) and reuse the signal beacon to get a bunch of transmission tower sites.


**ADVANCED STRATEGY FOR STEP 1:** Take record of the ships that come into the space station.  Usually it's the same people with the same ships.  Learn the colors for speed. For example, if you learn that the red ships will buy the item at 100%, so you can quickly sell your shit there instead of hiking back to the computer terminal.  I've seen differences between people, so it's best to just learn the colors for your group. (Thanks to /u/ikbosh and /u/umbrasquall)


**TLDR: no**

<TEXT> Hey ya'll, been seeing a lot of posts on here in regard to the team, and many memes with Sean.  While this is great, I thought i'd branch out and start recognizing some other notable members: one being Innes.  From what I hear, he joined the team with some great experience in procedural programming, and he's been a tremendous asset.

If anyone has seen his NUCLAI presentation on NMS's procedural programming, it's genius.  [Here's a link](https://archives.nucl.ai/recording/building-a-galaxy-procedural-generation-in-no-mans-sky/).

[Also, he's pretty clever in his twitter game](https://twitter.com/innesmck) </TEXT>

<TEXT> if you have 90% IV, go for it.  It's a suggestion just cause you generally encounter high ones based on level, but you got a good one already.  Also, some people like to save it for then, because they can use a lucky egg and do them all at once since it is so hard to level up your char at that point.  However, above all, it's just a game.  Unless you are trying to be ultra competitive and be like "ranked," don't worry about following superformulae or anything.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> thought about doing one for "The Last Question" by Issac Asimov for a long while but i'll probably avoid it.  One thing about poetry is that it's usually only a single page out of a giant book.  I also never read the entire book.  In a short story, I wouldn't want to finish it because I think the authors should still be able to sell their books without having to compete with their material being entirely free online. </TEXT>

Since the first one went pretty great, I would love to do this again.  I had a lot of great recommendations of obscure poems that were quite frankly, awesome.  Even some greats I somehow missed.  I do readings for [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7tZlg2ZJPVDcVKjbbqxx6A) and I am also the creator of the subreddit /r/PoetryReadings.  

Would love for this community to grow, so if you have any great poems that lack the spoken form, let me know!  Thanks!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For a graphic workstation: Been wondering for a while now why I don't just get a large used motherboard with a ton of slots, buy like 3-4 ton of cheap sapphire radeons (r90 is 230 new, like 150 a pop used 4 way crossfire) now that the 1080 is out and people are selling them and make a super graphic workstation.

Is it a bad idea to buy a bunch of used an semi-outdated equipment rather than getting near-cutting edge stuff?

For example, this dude made [this LEGENDARY build](http://pcpartpicker.com/user/bdecarvalho/saved/bKvPxr) that was like 20k, but it was all, cutting edge stuff.  Can't I make a super super computer for like 1/3rd the price using all this parallel PSU and multiple graphics card logic?  Just been curious about this and y'all are geniuses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you very much.  It simply comes down to me liking the read more.  I like to branch out, but I don't get that many suggestions, and I went through the top 100 poems on poemhunter.  Frank O'Hara is perhaps my favorite poet, but his work style seems to change a lot from piece to piece, while Bukowski seems to stay somewhat fluid.  In the end, I guess it just comes down to me reading what I like best and taking suggestions as they come. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Purposeful "lock-squatting" hurting community </TITLE>

<TEXT> Dear mods,

I wanted to talk to you here because I wasn't sure where else.  The subreddit pewdiepie is locked, and although there is an active mod (active in the sense that he uses reddit, not on subreddit), he purposely is squatting on it to make sure no one can use it.  In a conversation I had with him, he said it is because the "community is awful."  This is TERRIBLE usage of the community guidelines of reddit.  It is simply of no USE and is purposely subtracting from what makes reddit great.  I love pewdiepie's community, on youtube AND tumblr, and would love to bring it here.  I am also currently the mod for TheMarzipans (a Marzia Bisogni/Pewdiepie'sgf subreddit) and am hoping to make the community alive.  There are many ways to keep a subreddit clean by picking great and dedicated mods.  I was hoping you would be able to let me moderate this subreddit, or in the very least, for the sake of reddit, unlock it.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.

EDIT:  In the community guidelines, I believe it falls under "Breaking Reddit" </TEXT>

Simulations like these are what got me into blender.  Is this a simple gravity vortex with some sort of spin on this?  How can I get liquid to move slow like this?  How can I do this?  Any tutorials on this would be awesome.

<TEXT> Just built mine two days ago.  BIGGEST THING:  keep your boxes organized.  I took out the plastic bags with screws from each and was crazy confused.  Also, two most important pamphlets, (Aside from Tom's Hardware guide) are the instruction booklet from your case and the instruction booklet from your motherboard.  Alternate back and forth to get all cables in the right spaces.  I also went to PC partpicker and searched for builds using my case to see how people configured it when I wanted a clearer picture of how the motherboard was placed to calm my nerves.  Good luck! </TEXT>

**Was looking for general advice of how to get the most of out it now that it's built.**  I use it for gaming, and the only general advice I know of is to download the latest driver's for the graphic cards, which I did.  I hear other stories of how people check to see if all RAM is being used, which I believe is.  Now, if I have general settings set, in the settings menu, will that be capped, or can I push max settings there if the pc is using moderate settings?  Also, what antivirus should I use?  And furthermore, should I be turning my PC off every night?  Looking for some general post-build tips!  Thanks y'all! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [MISCELLANEOUS] Use Paribus with NewEgg and Amazon for automatic moneyback during price drops </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-08 19:03:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They take out 40%, but they check your email for receipts from NewEgg and Amazon.  They then monitor the item, and if the price drops they use the agreement of sale to get the price difference on deals.  Useful when you use amazon or newegg a lot.  Also, the more you refer, the higher total of money back percentage wise.

[Here's a non-referring link cause i'm not an asshole.](https://Paribus.co)

Guessing over the long run, both SSD and google drive storage will be cheaper.  Not sure if I should worry about "future proofing" in terms of storage as buildapc is big on not future proofing. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Discussion] Cheaper to buy google storage than external SSD in long run? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-07 22:32:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Looking for very long term storage to store my videos.  Often each one is 1-2 GB, and my one year old external 2TB HDD is 75% full.  I carry around a backpack with it inside often, and I've had a few HDD become toast due to the traveling lifestyle.  I've been looking at SSD prices but man, they are insanely expensive.  Is it cheaper just to buy 2 TB's of google drive, which is like 5 bucks a year?  Asking because not sure if it is a good investment for the long run because not sure if the SSD will ever become cheaper than google drive.  Please advise y'all. </TEXT>

Would love to expand upon this channel by having some older but interesting works (non-original), and what better place to ask.  Would also be great if there is not yet a reading of the poem.  Love this subreddit, and it's a great place to peruse during any mood.  Any suggestion is greatly appreciated!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> wow, this is a genius idea.  Thank you!  As a novice, i've been always dumping JSON output in another file and then attempting to parse huge files or clean it.  This is so much better.  Just one question though, i'm confused by the text = MyApi.read(myURL).  I used this, which gives me the parsed selection but then dumps the complete JSON after it.  Obviously i'm missing a small bit.  This is what I have:

     require "tumblr_client"

     client = Tumblr::Client.new :consumer_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
     
     myURL = client.posts 'example.tumblr.com', :type = 'photo', :limit = 1
     
     myURL['posts'].each { |post| puts post['post_url'] }

What am I missing here, where does the **text = MyApi.read(myURL)** come in?  I apologize if this is a frustrating question, but I am really eager to learn this and I am learning a lot from you.  Thank you!! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-01-17 00:33:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, figured a lot of you have worked with UE4 so thought it would be quicker to ask.  I want to make trees in blender to import, but I wanted to make the scale correctly in blender.  I am basing my game off the default "First Person Shooter" blueprint.  I did a quick bing search and found [this](http://www.worldofleveldesign.com/categories/ue4/ue4-guide-to-scale-dimensions.php) which states the default character height to be 180uu/180cm (approx. 6ft).  Is that true of only the third person scale, or is that also true for the first person perspective? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Build Help] $67 AMD X4 3.7 GHz vs $174 Intel i5 3.2 GHz </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-16 04:28:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Huge difference on the price.  One is four cores and 3.7 GHz while the other is five cores at 3.2 GHz at a much higher price.  Is the Intel almost three times better as the price is three times higher?  Or is there not much of a difference in performance?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here is [my build](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/partlist/), which I based off the Media Elite in the wiki.  All of the builds there don't have sound cards or wired network connectors, is there a reason for this?  the graphics area has a hdmi port, but I'm guessing I still need a sound card for it to be transmitted through hdmi right?  Any advice here on a good cheap one?  If I skimp out and buy the cheapest one, does it make a big difference? </TEXT>

<TEXT> We used it for hunting. We would chase animals long distance at a low speed. Animals nearby would sprint when close and they would never get to really eat because of the lack of hands, and we would nonstop be following them.  We could grab a bunch of berries or contain water and eat while we moved. Eventually we won on the endurance front. However, this is good for large game animals that dont fight back like gazelles. Fish, birds and others we couldnt keep up with. Nowadays, it's quicker, safer, and has a wider variety if we just used weapons. </TEXT>

I also checked past posts with Celestron TravelScope70 but they are all using an ipod/camera phone and they are also archived so I can't ask further.

And question in interpreting, just to make sure: the parts that are between |:   and   :| are simply broken so to show was sections are being repeated, correct?
(Also, I work with MIDI, so the MIDI file would be absolutely fantastic.) </TEXT>

I have a huge list of commands, one line at a time, that I want Ruby to do, but if there is an error due to a faulty line, I want Ruby to just continue to the next line.

Basically it looks like this:

    Begin

    CODE

    Rescue

    "next?"

    End


Would the "next" command work here, or is that only for loops? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey this is really great advice. I'll take solid note of this. (Oh and before I forget, I have been looking into mechanical licenses).

<TEXT> Hey guys/gals,
I'm new to composing but I always wanted to start making pieces. I've been trying to make an orchestral version of Soko's "For Marlon". Figured it'd be good cause it feels sort of simplistic yet has a ton of notes. **I have them all transcribed into piano notes, and I am curious how I would break it into a mini orchestra.** Should I just split all the notes above middle C to be played by violin and all the notes below by cello or would that sound rubbish? Or should I do that and make a third simultaneous track with a piano that plays the whole score? I understand the best way is to try it out, but it takes a TON of time and looking for some advice on the way forward. Anyone have some experience with this? </TEXT>

I'm like to transcribe guitar music tabs to piano keys or MIDI.  I use [this guitar chart picture](http://i.imgur.com/XzWZwuK.png) typically; however I'm not sure what happens to all these notes when a CAPO is put on fret seven.  I edited the picture by highlighting what middle C SOUNDS like on a guitar (I believe actual middle C sounds one octave lower on the guitar).  Figured the best place to ask this is here.

**Any help is greatly appreciated!** </TEXT>

Then there is another one where he is praying to basically every God he can, give me a sec, i'll look for it.  EDIT: here it is: http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/for-jane-with-all-the-love-i-had-which-was-not-e/

He also talking about praying in " The Spider" (here :http://bybukowski.tumblr.com/page/3) when he is pretty sick.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **I'm going to start off by apologizing in advance if this is asking too much, but I am trying to learn.**


The project I have been working on is a data sorter, using social media. I figure this is a good stepping stone that I can build off of later to make bots.


So I used the tumblr API and got some data *(I replaced it all with fictional info here for posting purposes. I know it's all public, but even then I don't like to share info.)* It's a JSON, and here is a fragment of it: http://pastebin.com/TrwCLnBZ


The question is, how do I turn it into an object that is easier to use, so I can call on it and ask for certain criteria, like blog names that have the "type" that is "quote"? There are a ton of these, as you can see, and the pastebin only includes two.


Again, I am really, REALLY appreciated for any help or advice anyone can give to me on this. Posted this as well on /r/Ruby, but thought I should also post here. Thank you! xo </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey ausphex,

Interesting anecdote, I looked into it.  Didn't find anything relating to "Senile-ty" (maybe the search term through google off) but did find that it was Archimedes.  From what I gathered, it was when he discovered the physics idea of "displacement" when he was in a bathtub.  When he realized it, he ran out of the bathtub, and without putting his clothes on he ran through the streets yelling "Eureka."  Try searching "Eureka Archimedes."  Perhaps problems with becoming senile beforehand made it an even bigger deal.

here are two quick (but **not the best** sources):

<TEXT> Hey guys,
I'm used to Ruby, and my head is getting a blur from the crossover and trying to research this simple question.
I want to assign a file's one-word text content as a python variable.
I'm trying to do this, but it's not working, what's wrong?

    variable = import('/Users/MacbookPro/Files/words.txt')


bonus question: If I am putting that variable in text, in ruby i'd use #{variable}, what would the python equivalent be? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been trying to practice my australian accent.  When reading accent prompts it's easy, but when I finally turned to an ordinary poem, I failed horrendously.  Can someone read this in an australian accent to know how it's done?

    "Theres nothing to mourn about death any more than there is to mourn about the growing of a flower. What is terrible is not death but the lives people live or dont live up until their death. They dont honor their own lives, they piss on their lives. They shit them away. Dumb fuckers. They concentrate too much on fucking, movies, money, family, fucking. Their minds are full of cotton. They swallow God without thinking, they swallow country without thinking. Soon they forget how to think, they let others think for them. Their brains are stuffed with cotton. They look ugly, they talk ugly, they walk ugly. Play them the great music of the centuries and they cant hear it. Most peoples deaths are a sham. Theres nothing left to die."

<TEXT> wow, thank you so much for the kind words.  It's *immensely* memorable to hear that others like the work i've put into it.
I haven't actually thought of that, but it could be a good idea.  What I might do, to make it even easier for me with older videos and for viewers, is make playlists for his work, book-by-book.  That way, if they dig it, a viewer could go through them one book at a time, or see what book it is from by seeing what playlists it is in.  May be a little more complicated as I think his publishers made a ton of "Bukowski collections" books later in his life/posthumously, but I think if I only stick to the ones he published himself during his lifetime it could work.  I'll definitely be looking into this!  Thanks!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Impressive post, I have to say.  It's very intriguing to see how Bukowski views loneliness as opposed to other people.  If you haven't already seen/read it, you should check out his poem "roll the dice," where he basically *directly* states that isolation is not a burden but a gift to be used.  Also, his book Ham On Rye, he gives a semi-fictional account of him growing up, and he had a terrible terrible upbringing where he was beaten senseless all the time, at home and at school, and he had one of the worst skin disorders growing up, so when he did finally get stronger, people gave him issues.  Basically he always hid from everything by being alone.  Not sure if he ended up rationalizing it all, or if its different from your case since he likes himself and not others, but he has a somewhat unique view of it.
I haven't checked out Vladimir Nabokov (nor heard of him before actually) or Poe's Alone, but I will now be definitely be checking it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, this is some really quality stuff.  Thank you so much for the translation, because without it, I would never have been able to read such great poetry.

As a hobby I make poetry readings for my youtube channel and /r/PoetryReadings.  I made three videos for these translations so that other english speakers can see it.  I gave you credit in the description of each video for the translation as well.  If you wanna hear a listen, they are scheduled for being posted at noon tomorrow EST.  Here are the links:

<TEXT> Awesome to hear that; he's one of my favorites.  His big style, aside from honesty like bukowski, is that many of his poems run like one complete continuous thought with no breaks.  Not sure of any poets with the "continuous" style.  However, if you want to incorporate that technique, I would highly recommend his poem ["Having A Coke With You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpK6_6BldO4) as it is basically just two run on sentences.  Even the title continues into the poem (bukowski has a few poems like this as well where the title is the first line).  Hope this helps!! :)

P.S. There is a /r/FrankOHara subreddit as well. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Build Help] How to research old motherboard? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-16 03:05:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I know i'm going to get a lot of comments saying I should start from scratch with a new build, but I'm actually going for a real challenge here.  I have an old Dell Precision 690.  I want to use the case, and i'm starting by switching the motherboard.  How can I go about finding what would fit in its place as it is custom built for the unit.  Should I simply take the interior out and measure the motherboard so I can find one that can fit in its place.  I also looked at ebay and found replacements, but I don't know what hints I should look at: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Genuine-Dell-Precision-Workstation-690-PWS-Motherboard-HR002-MY171-F9394-DT029-/151803536091?hash=item23583222db

I know it has an ATX form factor, but what size?
It's 6x6x6 inches.  Is that standard ATX size then?  Would the screws match up on all then?
It's a Dell 0MY171 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I know you're looking for nonrhyme, but I would look halfway in between if you are trying to transition, for example, check out slam poetry.  They rhyme only like 1/2 to 1/5th of the time.  For example, there are a lot of london artists that sing or slam poetry.  If you want a strong example to experience this with, read out loud the lyrics to scoobius' pips slam poetry called "You Will See Me."  Here's a link:  http://www.songlyrics.com/dan-le-sac-vs-scroobius-pip/you-will-see-me-lyrics/  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Barely.  They, quite literally, just scratched the surface on exploring the ocean.  These satellites map the topography in greater detail than before, but it's really only the top of the ocean floor.  What we need to be doing, and neglecting to, is search the crevices and trenches below.  The only one that they seem to actually go down and explore is James Cameron, who funded it with his own money so he could be the one that went down the lowest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone, I received a Dell Precision Workstation 690 from a relative. It's kinda big and has 16 GB of ram in it, upgradeable to 64 GB of ram. I thought it'd be a nice project to work on for my first buildapc, but as I look into it it's kinda old by computer standards. 


Here are the specs I have managed to find so far: -http://www.dell.com/us/dfb/p/precision-690/pd

-**I have two cores with 3.00ghz and 2.99Ghz**

-**Here is the graphics card**: http://www.amazon.com/DELL-Geforce-Heatsink-fan-X8764-heatsink-fan-X8764-HEATSINK-FAN/dp/B0045JNI92

-**Here are compatible graphics cards for this model**: http://i.imgur.com/CkveJqa.png

-**Here is probably every other detail you also want to know**: http://i.imgur.com/Nfw4jzq.png

What would you do to try and make this a better pc for gaming? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys.  I was looking to build a steambox for gaming.  It has a simple steam operating system.  Now, this may be a crazy noob question, but if i'm building it PURELY for this, is there a lot of parts I can cheap out on and just focus on graphics card and processor?  I'm looking to build a box for as cheap as possible that can play most steam games at high res.  Doesn't matter if it's loud or anything.  Super bonus points if anyone can point me to a cheap build for this. </TEXT>

    client.like reblog_key:Y2bQEifM, 'id:105694252174'
    sleep rand(2..3)
    client.like reblog_key:SakaWWdc, 'id:105694208300'
    sleep rand(2..3)

As you can see, the id number should be where the reblog_key thing is, and vice versa.  I also need to keep the " 's " in the reblog key section.  I can write a regex expression to delete these troublesome lines, but I'd rather save them if I can.  Any idea how I can do this? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What Can I Do With Dell Precision Workstation 690? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-18 22:52:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone, I received a Dell Precision Workstation 690 from a relative.  It's kinda big and has 8GB of ram, upgradeable to 64 GB of ram.  But I looked into it with crucialscan and the RAM is old DDR2.
I thought it'd be a nice project to work on for my first buildapc, but as I look into it it's kinda old by computer standards.
Here are the specs: http://www.dell.com/us/dfb/p/precision-690/pd

**Can I really modify it that much to a nice gaming setup without changing the motherboard?  Can I even change a motherboard on something like this?  Any help is greatly appreciated33**

EDIT: 
Here is the Memory scan output: http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/scanview/8755F31031D926C3

I have two cores with 3.00ghz and 2.99Ghz

Here is graphics card: http://www.amazon.com/DELL-Geforce-Heatsink-fan-X8764-heatsink-fan-X8764-HEATSINK-FAN/dp/B0045JNI92

<TITLE> [Troubleshooting] DVI madness in Dell Precision Workstation. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-14 21:04:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Building my first pc, starting with a dell precision workstation t3500.
I know it works, but I want to first hook it up to a monitor so I can do some system scans.  Trouble is, it's a bit old, and I don't know exactly what cables to use.

It has a Dell Nvidia geforce 7800 graphics card, with these ports on the side:
http://sishardware.com/imgs/a/b/d/x/w/dell_nvidia_geforce_7800_gtx_256mb_pci___e_dual_dvi_x8764_3_lgw.jpg

So I see two DVI's and an S-video port.  Now, to use that, do I need to find a dual cable, or a dual cable plus an S-video port, or can I just use only one of those?  I have a tv with an hdmi input so I was just going to buy a Male DVI-I to Female HDMI adaptor and just use an HDMI cable.

Also, that DVI has 21+5.  Can I use a DVI 21+1 and ignore those 4 squares in the picture, or does it have to be a certain type?  I was planning on buying this:http://www.amazon.com/BlueRigger-Speed-Adapter-Cable-Meters/dp/B004S4R5CK/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics ie=UTF8 qid=1439578687 sr=1-3 keywords=dvi+to+hdmi

<TEXT> yes, and then overlay it using a tracking scene.  Make it all appear right before the action in a smooth transition.  The hole you see after it breaks could be another footage of the cabinet with its doors open overlayed after the action.  Basically its

Regular scene  --SWITCH to 3D Setup --ACTION -- Mix of footage with doors open and broken 3d setup overtop.  

For the second footage I am putting in, I would open the cupboard doors, cover the doors with green to remove it, and put the 3d overtop of it so I have broken doors plus the interior.  

sorry if that sounds convoluted! </TEXT>

<TEXT> When your current life situation is bad, and you're sitting in bed not wanting to start the day, I think of this quote by Charles Bukowski.  It makes me feel like no situation is really important but yourself and love.  Here it goes:


**"We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing." - CHARLES BUKOWSKI** </TEXT>

Not a problem.  I think the day 1 material would be common, so if you really want to make it stand out you should show a bunch of tutorials, like maybe quick project-a-day type posts where you show how to make neat stuff with the newly learned stuff.  I think most people learning programming are not looking too far into the future and won't be that interested in high level stuff.  But you could always break the blog into a Newcomer and Advanced sections. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Looking to make something that is almost exactly like this: https://elliott.codes/wiki/archillect **

As you can see, it utilizes API, decision trees, and eventish actions,
so I am not sure if it would be better to make with javascript and Node.js or Ruby with eventmachine socket.
Any advice?  Bonus points if anyone could give me a quick blueprint of what steps they would do or how they would approach this.

Not looking to look great, but looking to definitely know that I am in shape.  Anyone have any good quantitative test for this?  I'm sure there are heart rate tests, but any such as "being able to complete XXXXX in XXXXX minutes."  Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

"In 1975, while riding a moped in Bermuda, a man was accidentally struck and killed by a taxi. One year later, this man's bother was killed in the very same way. In fact, he was riding the very same moped. And to stretch the odds even further, he was struck by the very same taxi driven by the same driver - and even carrying the very same passenger!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone, now I know this is a kinda broad question, and probably not the best approach to fitness, but I have been pondering it so I thought I'd ask.

If I wanted to just be able to eat whatever I want and a quite a bit of it, and i'm not talking like crazy amounts or like eat-nothing-but-donuts, but how much would I have to run daily to do this?  I know it's kind of hard to tell because of genetics and every body being different, but if someone ran 6 miles every day, for the most part, would they be slim? </TEXT>

<TEXT> thank you for the input!  However, i'm trying to follow this,  I changed the code so when it is defined copy_unique_lines doesn't have arguments.  But I now get an output error that copy_unique_lines is an undefined local variable?


It now looks like this: http://pastebin.com/aE31aVje </TEXT>

<TEXT> wow, didn't want to pester you again so I made a new post, but thank you!
one issue though, if you look at the list in the beginning of each line there is a number, period, and a bunch of spaces.  I think the code takes that and the final url looks like this

"https://www.zooamerica.com/1. horse/2.           mammal"

how do I make it ignore this?  can't figure it out with this code because i've never really encountered scan.file usage before you in my learning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This seems to greatly work!  Thank you!  Basically what I was trying to do was clean up a file cause it is output from an API filled with a ton of junk x 1000.  
What would actually be a real goal for me is to make it look through each line, and if somewhere in that line it says "MEOW" then I want it to go back and search the last 20 lines before it for a line that says "PUPPY" and then paste the rest of that line into a new file.  And so forth for the rest of the file.

Any way you can modify the above code for that?  Seems like a tiny bit of work but I have reddit credits and can gift you more reddit gold for that. </TEXT>

However, while using natural gas to power a car is clean, the PROCESS of getting the natural gas (aka fracking) is pretty bad contamination wise.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace. Wed run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-two minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile [Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a half minutes per mile]. So this morning he said to me Were going to go five. I said, Bruce, I cant go five. Im a helluva lot older than you are, and I cant do five. He said, When we get to three, well shift gears and its only two more and youll do it. I said Okay, hell, Ill go for it. So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and Im okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out. Im tired, my hearts pounding, I cant go any more and so I say to him, Bruce if I run any more, and were still running-if I run any more Im liable to have a heart attack and die. He said, Then die. It made me so mad that I went the full five miles. Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it. I said, you know, Why did you say that? He said, Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, itll spread over into the rest of your life. Itll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level. "
