<TEXT> From a listia.com post about the game:

New, shrinkwrapped game of "Panty Raid".  Some of the spots on the game board; Take a drink, kiss a player, pinch a player's buns, undo a button or zipper, make an animal sound, imitate an *****, tickle a navel, make a sexual sound, kiss a body part below waist, lick your favorite thigh, nibble an earlobe....this gives you an idea of how the game goes. There are panties and shorts, some rule about the Dean's shorts, it looks a bit complicated, but then again I never went to college.

This is new, still in the shrinkwrap. We bought out a recently defunct joke shop to stock our website ThatRestlessMouse.com - Posting some of the onesie-twosie items here for your enjoyment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I am currently experiencing something similar only later in time. I am 34F and my mom just turned 69. Obese, type 2 diabetes, insulin daily, many other health problems including heart problems and metabolic syndrome. I had to take her to emergency on Tuesday as her already red and puffy legs/feet were turning black. She was sent home but it's only a matter of time before they will need to get amputated. 

It frustrates me because my father has MS, which is progressing quickly and he is now in a wheelchair. For many years he did everything as she was too weak etc. But after he fell and broke his hip, he took over doing things like groceries. Problem is she is entirely dependent on a Walker and has a very hard time standing for more than 10 minutes. So if she has to go in hospital (she was hospitalized a couple years ago with bad oozing leg thing) then my dad is screwed. Anyway I could go on forever. 

So yes I totally get it. It drives me insane. At every moment I thought she would turn herself around but she never does. I have accepted that she has chosen to slowly kill herself but it hurts to see and to have to deal with (esp because I have 2 children and work full time). 

If you ever want to chat and commiserate please pm me. It would be good to have someone to chat about it with. I wish I had some advice for you. But all I can say is prepare for the worst.  </TEXT>

I am the mom in the scenario you described from your childhood and because of this parenting disparity and an ultra crappy relationship I think of splitting up constantly.

<TITLE> Small tax return: Am I Using it Optimally? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-23 16:29:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone.

I have read the "Read this First: How to Handle $" information but I just wanted to double check that I'm making the best use of my little tax return.  I am using You Need a Budget as well (new one, I'm new to all this).

I'm getting $1470 back.  I have $250 in chequing, $430 on my credit card, and the $500 I had for emergency fund I just invested in retirement savings (canadian), which I had never had before.

My thoughts for splitting this up:
- pay off credit card first
- put $500 in emergency fund (and build from there)
- put the rest into chequing and give those dollars jobs like home maintenance or auto maintenance, creating a bit of a buffer and insulating me against any minor expenses that might come up.

With all this YNAB and Personal Finance research I've done I've realized I was drastically overspending each month and have barely enough to work with after obligations.

Anyway, I know this is super small beans compared to a lot of posts here, but I just wanted to know if I'm doing this right or I should be doing something totally different.  Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I've cut my own for over 10 years. I have a short, angled Bob and people are always impressed with the cut and I'm frequently asked where I get my hair done. It's not always perfect at the back but I can't imagine the amount of money I've saved. 

I also cut my husband and my two boys' hair with a clipper. I wasn't great at first but now I have to say I am pretty decent. I've cut other people's hair too but I am pretty nervous. 

I would say if you keep practising you'll get pretty good and save a ton of money,  especially women.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

I've been reading up on this subreddit because I finally need to start taking control of my finances. I'm not sure if any background information is relevant so please let me know if I need to provide more info.

Right now I have very little in my chequing account.  In my savings account I have about $1100.  And on my credit card I have about $1000.  

I just want to double check that it would be wiser to keep the money in savings (ie as an emergency fund) rather than pay off the (I think relatively) low credit card balance all at once.  It feels very tempting to just wipe out the CC balance because I can probably only contribute $50-100 to pay off that balance.

Any advice / criticism is welcome.  I have been foolish with money and need to get a grip because I am 33 and have no retirement savings what-so-ever.

Thank you. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My 8 year old isn't fitting in at school </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-22 02:06:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone,

Problem: Today my son came home quite despondent from school saying he isn't in any group and the other kids are ignoring him and excluding him.

Background: At the end of June we moved from a large diverse city to a suburb that's much more homogeneous.  The kid's last school was small, near a University and we'd been included in the community after joining the community playschool many years ago.  So my son had grown up with many of the kids and they had shared interests, like video games and toys.  The new school is on the edge of the suburb and also serves rural students who get bused in.  It has a more "country" feel and reminds me of the small-town school I grew up with (for better or worse).  We started this September.  I am starting to dislike the school for a few minor, petty reasons, but I am trying not to let that cloud my judgement and also my Kindergartener seems to love it.

Situation:  The boys in the class (when you're in grade 3 of course you don't really want to play with the girls I guess though he had a few girl friends at the last school) seem to be ignoring Aidan and excluding him from the lunch table.  The classic "oh we're saving this seat for someone" or "we only want 5 people at the table" bullshit.  I have seen him walk up to a group of boys in the morning and he doesn't seem to say anything (shy) but they don't seem to even acknowledge him.  There was another new boy in the class and he said that they include him.  They also pick him last for everything.  He says they don't share the same interests (Star Wars) and I've observed that the school has a greater emphasis on sports (hockey, this is Canada) so I wonder if he isn't connecting on that level.

Another problem is that I've started working full-time for the first time ever so I don't have the opportunity to see the other parents or socialize.  Everyone in the community we moved to has kids going to schools all over so I haven't found any kids that actually go to this school in particular.  We bought a house next to this school so the kids could walk. And we couldn't afford to buy in our old neighborhood.

It's breaking my heart.  I was never a popular kid but I always had  friends because I'd been in my hometown my entire life. I want to help him but now sure to what extent to do it.  Here are my possible solutions:

* talk to the teacher to see what she suggests
* work with him to improve his likeability/interaction (horrible, he should not have to change)
* ask to switch to the other Grade 3 class in the school
* consider switching schools, but there's no guarantee the kids would be any better at a different one and we also had a hard time finding out of school care anywhere.
* ????


Any advice / perspective / ideas, etc would be welcome!!!! I feel so bad for him and I don't want him to be the outcast. He had a great group of friends in the old school who still miss him and love him.

Thanks. </TEXT>

As well, he may have some insight into his friends families and how they may respond (maybe one family could go off the rails with over discipling and this ends up being harmful to the friend).  </TEXT>

Your parents are even bigger douchebags.  I can't believe their reaction but I guess for you its pretty typical.

I wish I had some good advice. But other people will have some and I would heed the common sense consensus. 

Good luck and please keep us posted. I'm glad you made this decision.   </TEXT>

I really wanted to be on the jury as it was such a different experience and perfect timing. I sat all day long watching people get called up and whatever excuse they gave they didn't have to serve. It was crazy, just the most mundane things. So I sat there for 7 hours and never got called once. Total bummer. So anyway,  where I was you would have totally been able to get out of jury duty.  </TEXT>
