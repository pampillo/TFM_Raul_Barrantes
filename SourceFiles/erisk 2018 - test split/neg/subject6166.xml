<TEXT> When Taki tells Mitsuha that he drank her Kuchikamizake, she gets embarrassed and calls him a pervert.

Is it true that drinking her Kuchikamizake is like sharing a kiss? If not, why does she call him a pervert then?

<TEXT> They were waking up with writings on their faces and their books. There was a book in the library which had all the names of the people who died.
After the new timeline, the news reads that everyone survived miraculously.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In summary, the Armitage family want to be *in* black people's body. They don't want to *be* black. While we see them loving black people's physique, they have little or no care for their minds. They don't care that the black folks are let to rot in the Sunken Space for all their lives while another person resides and "uses" the body.

This distinction is very crucial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While one would look at the initial behavior of Rose's parents and ask what was racist about their behavior, the movie tries to point out the fact that this is how it exists in the current world. When Rose's dad meets Chris, he starts using words like "thang" and "ma' man". As Rose mentions these are words that he's never used. This happens in real life too, people tend to go out of the way to be "accommodating" towards people of other race that they end up over doing it. Suddenly you have Rose's dad trying to talk like an African-American. Of course, the film shows them in a whole new light later on.

Same thing with the cop. He's simply asking for Chris's ID. But Chris was not driving. Yet he's asking for his ID. It is subtle but it's there.

Can someone explain how Rose's mother was being rude to Georgina, when she spills the tea? What was the implication of asking her to "take some rest"?

<TEXT> In movie Split, Kevin's dad is said to have left on a train and never return. Kevin was a very young boy then. Is it possible that Kevin's father left on the same train which had David Dunn (Bruce Willis) traveling in? Could it be that Kevin's dad was one of the 131 passengers who died back then? Is this why Kevin leaves flowers at the train station? Is that why Kevin becomes the Beast inside a train? Given the movies are related, would these things be related too?
