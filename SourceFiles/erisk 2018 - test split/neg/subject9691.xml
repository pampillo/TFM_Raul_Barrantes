<TEXT> I absolutely agree that SF is more speculative. My problem with calling Fantasy escapist, though, is that it has such a negative connotation. There are plenty of things to be learned from Fantasy, and often (in the books I read) comments on the human condition just as much as Science Fiction, (although much more subtly than other genres). 

Also, is not all fiction escapist? Regardless of whether or not there's a whole new world, readers put themselves in the stories with the other characters and become a part of that world. It's how we connect to it and feel pain when a character we love dies or feel a sense of wonder with them as they see incredible things. We escape into the lives of most main characters. Or at least I do. When I read a book, regardless of the genre, I exit reality for a while simply because I put myself into the main character's reality. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What separates Fantasy from Science Fiction? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-17 17:04:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm writing my senior thesis on the importance of Fantasy as a genre and I'm attempting to come up with a simple definition of it.

My working (very basic) definition of fantasy is currently: A genre that features the use of supernatural phenomena in the plot, setting, or theme, or characters. It is separated from science fiction by technology, and from horror by intent (although, you could technically have a horror plot in a fantastic setting).

However, I have realized that this definition doesn't really leave a place for movies like Star Wars and others. 

Any thoughts on how I can improve my definition? </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are the best steps to becoming an editor of fiction? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm going to be graduating this spring with a Bachelor's in English (my concentration is Professional Writing). My ultimate goal is to edit novels. The problem is that I have done a lot of academic editing, but not a lot of editing for creative writing. 

I really need the experience before I become an editor, but I'm not sure the best way to do that. I've looked into becoming an editorial assistant, and I've also thought starting out with something different and then transitioning into editorial work.

Any thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was little, my friend spent the night with me while we were camping.  We slept in the same bed.  In the middle of the night, she wakes me up and says, "I don't feel so good," and promptly projectile vomits everywhere.  I back away from her and start screaming for my parents, and she follows me on hands and knees as she continues to throw up. In my mind, it seemed like she was the puke monster chasing me into a corner.

I had a huge phobia of being around sick people for years. </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by spilling water on my motherboard </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-12 04:17:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> EDIT:  We just turned my computer back on and IT WORKS!!! So happy!

This just happened like ten minutes ago.  I was playing LoL with a friend and decided to take a sip of water.  No big deal, right? Wrong.  I had put the top on my water bottle without screwing it on, so before I went to take a sip, I went to shake my water bottle (i don't know why, I just did.  Yes I'm weird, sue me.) and the cap came off and a little water splashed onto my freaking tower.  I waited a second because not that much water actually got onto my tower and I didn't know if it was that big of a deal.  It was.  Sadly, what water did fall onto my tower fell right on top of my motherboard...so my computer died. Now I have to wait like 3 days before I dare attempt to turn on my computer again.  Hopefully it's not dead because I really can't afford to get a new one. 

TLDR:  spilled a little water onto the motherboard of my computer.  It died and now I have to wait and see if it shorted everything. Woe is me.

<TITLE> My husband was just diagnosed with depression - please pray for us. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-01 04:07:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Edit:  Thank you all so much for your advice, kind words,  and prayers.  I feel so encouraged just to know that there are people out there who have been where we are and are in good places now.  I really appreciate all of you taking the time to comment.  God bless you all!


First off, I've never posted before so hopefully I'm doing this right.  My husband has struggled with depression on and off his entire life.  He has experienced some really crappy things, and depression tends to run in his family.  We've been married for two years, and everything has been really wonderful, but recently he's been extremely depressed to the point where he's developed social anxiety and has a difficult time even going to work.  

It's been really hard on both him and me, and I guess the reason I'm sharing this is because I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to about it.  Part of me is scared that my family will see this as a weakness, and I also feel like sharing it with someone I know would be an invasion of his privacy. 

TLDR: Please pray for the both of us: that he will receive healing and that I will be supportive and loving through it all. </TEXT>
