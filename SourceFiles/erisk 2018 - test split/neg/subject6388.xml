<TEXT> This is worthless. This is hopeless. I am worthless. I am hopeless. This is wrong. This is unfair. I am wrong. I am lazy. I hate myself. I hate everything. You annoy me. Happy people annoy me. I just want to see you suffer. Yes, my so-called best friend, my so-called loved ones, my so-called girlfriend, and my readers. I want everyone to suffer.  

I wasnt like this before. I remember I was such a lovely, innocent and cute kid. I had a fragile body but I had a kind soul and a heart of gold.  
My dad was an alcoholic. I thought he was a nice guy because he used to say so. I believed him. After all, he was my dad. It didnt bother me he stopped working so that he could spend all day with his love- alcohol and drugs. What bothered me was the fact that after getting drunk he used to beat my mom. I and my brother would intervene but only to face his wrath. Studying became difficult because locking doors, being a prisoner in your own home is difficult. Constant yelling and fighting becomes the cherry on top and there goes your mind in a spiral of negative thoughts.  
This went on for years. Day by day it became difficult to put a smile on my face and pretend everything was normal. I lived in a good area. Everyone is middle/upper middle class here.  
In 12th grade, it was the first time I had the urge to see everyone suffer. To see what it feels to suffer. Theyd then develop empathy and compassion. Yes, I wanted to see them suffer.  
  
I noticed I started envying my best friend when one day he showed me the DSLR camera that he had bought. I wanted one so badly but due to being poor I couldnt even afford it in my dreams. I was annoyed. I felt guilty but the feeling of envy was too strong.  
I decided to go to his home later that day. I told him wed chill and watch movies. I arrived at 4:00 PM at his house. I rang the door bell and we went to his room. We decided to watch Conjuring because I love horror. Before we started the movie I asked him to grab some snacks. He went to his kitchen and I thought this was the moment. I reached to the stool on which his camera was resting. I grabbed it and threw it out the window next to me. My friend asked what was that sound? I told him I dont know.   
I turned off the lights and rationalized to him that true fun of horror is in the dark. He agreed.  

After the movie finished I came back home. Next day, he told me he cant find his camera anywhere. I acted concerned but deep down I was ecstatic. Seeing him sad made me happy.   
I slowly started envying when I saw people having fun and posting pictures on Facebook. I needed to see someone suffer. I met my girlfriend and she told me she will be playing guitar in a local competition and I had to be there. I always wanted to play guitar but I never had a knack of it. I was jealous of her talent.  
She was looking forward to the competition. A day before the competition I went over to her house. I thought about pulling a string of her guitar but knew she could find a replacement of that. I needed something more permanent.   

I took a needle and started playfully scare her. I made it seem look like an accident and managed to stab her left index finger. She started screaming and crying. She was bleeding a lot. I brought some chilled water to wash the blood and later band-aided her finger. It all seemed like a prank gone wrong and that I didnt do it deliberately. She forgave me but was dejected because no way she could perform next morning because she couldnt even play the chords properly with her injured finger.  

I felt amazing. I acted as if I was sorry and I gave her a passionate kiss. She was still dejected because she was so excited to play at the competition. I felt ecstatic once again. Deep down I was thrilled and seeing her sad made me happy.  

So now Im writing this as I crave that ecstatic feeling once again. Are you enjoying reading stories here? Well, well see how you will read tomorrow when youll wake up with your eyes stitched. Im coming for you.

<TEXT> They grieve like crazy when someone close to them passes away but that is how nature works. The goal should be to make sure the younger ones are independent and can sustain themselves. I know death is an uncomfortable thing to discuss but what's the point of avoiding inevitable? If people were more open about it instead of pretending it won't happen then things might become easier when it finally happens. </TEXT>

Example, two friends(male) have admitted they don't want to hang out. Third friend(female) says she wants to. I tell her nobody will come. She says I am negative. Well, the fuck? The guys have admitted they don't wanna hang out. How does that make me a negative thinker? I am blunt and answers straight forward. I am a realist.  </TEXT>

I have realized everything is earned in this world. Parents are the only ones who will love you unconditionally.   
Rest is earned. Money, friendships, cars, girls, house etc. Every single thing out there is earned.  
I recommend lifting, running, reading, try to not talk about your actual feelings to women. It's a turn off.  
Be mysterious. Appear as an interesting guy. Remember, no one wants to involve themselves with a negative person and a negative  life. So, talk about things that people may find interesting.  
I am same as you and I intend to apply changes in my life.  
We can all wallow in our sadness till the end of life but the truth is talking won't get you anywhere. It's the actions that count. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got back from a get-together.
Well, my brother and cousins were having fun, talking about movies, songs, singers, stupid shit etc. They were genuinely happy and having fun. I was genuinely depressed and anxious and pretended to be happy.
I always do a bad job at this. They know I am not having fun and interested but the thing is I love them but hate myself and my life. I do put on a smile but I have nothing to speak.
My brother watches GoT, Breaking bad, lots of movies and he has so many things to say and on the other hand, I am constantly depressed and don't do anything so I have nothing to say.
I hate it because I don't want anyone's sympathy.  
I feel so left out everywhere I go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got back from a get-together.  
Well, my brother and cousins were having fun, talking about movies, songs, singers, stupid shit etc. They were genuinely happy and having fun. I was genuinely depressed and anxious and pretended to be happy.  
I always do a bad job at this. They know I am not having fun and interested but the thing is I love them but hate myself and my life. I do put on a smile but I have nothing to speak.  
My brother watches GoT, Breaking bad, lots of movies and he has so many things to say and on the other hand, I am constantly depressed and don't do anything so I have nothing to say.  
I hate it because I don't want anyone's sympathy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a female friend. She chats with me a lot and we have been talking a lot lately. Thing is we chat during the night and sometimes even till about 2-3 AM. She has joked about making me her boyfriend twice although I understand why she was so desperate because she said she feels lonely.  
The second time she did this I told her it is extremely disrespectful  to joke about these things. The problem is now I feel I shouldn't text her to entertain her all the time. She texts me because she feels lonely and I can't help but think I am the one who will keep entertaining her and one day a guy will come and reap the rewards of my hard work.  
He'll get companionship, sex and what not from her while I would have wasted my time texting her all day and night. I think I shouldn't entertain her if all she wants is this from me. What do you guys think?  
Don't tell me I am a prick because I can use this time to sleep, chat with others, study etc. instead of entertaining her. I do not want to waste my time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, there is no way a person will ever love us for being us. We gotta fight our way and earn them. Yes, I mean even the people as well. There is a girl I saw who loves a "great guy" who just happens to be a "CEO". Imagine that dude being homeless. The "great guy" will suddenly become a loser. It's so easy to manipulate people's mind but this is the truth.  
In this world, you have to play it like a game and earn everything. Food, cloth, shelter, water, house, love, girls, cars, friendships etc. Everything is earned and nothing is given. It's depressing and I get depressed thinking about it as well but hey, this is just the truth.  
As I wrote this comment my friend tagged me on a facebook photo. His cousin made a sketch of him and it's good. But, I hope he soon realizes I don't really care either. Nobody cares about me. I don't care about them either. It's annoying when people like him just wants everyone to care about them but give no care in return.  
This dude never asks me how I am doing and what I have been up to. Keeps tagging in his facebook posts, talks about himself and then cry no one gives a fuck about him. Well, give a fuck about others and people will give a fuck in return. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No I don't live in USA. I live in a culture where living away from your parents is not a thing. Even if I get a job I won't make enough money  to rent out a place and fulfill my basic needs as well. I am kinda stuck here. It's all a vicious cycle but for others saying "get a job" is so easy. Well, if it was that easy I wouldn't be complaining and would have already found the solution. Like I said even a job wouldn't warrant living away just yet. I will at least need a BA before I can even hope to find a decent job so it's just not that easy. I dropped out from college this semester and will pursue a degree but that will take 3 years to complete.  
It's all a vicious cycle and there's no way I can get out of it so suddenly. I just wanted someone to listen to me but as it turns out I am alone in my battle. Anyway, no one can take away my problems from me no matter what, even if they listened. I just don't know what to do anymore.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup and I have listened to her problems so I know they can't be compared with mine. Her main problem usually is "My boyfriend is not talking to me, my life is SO hard uaaan" whereas mine is "I live with an alcoholic, unemployed, drug-addict, abuser of a father who spends money on drugs and working is not that easy for me because I have seen abuse and trauma while growing up and now my throat is dry, rapid heartbeat, shaky hands and I am always thinking about suicide, I am worthless and hopeless".  
I may be wrong but my guess is my life is *slightly* harder than hers. But hey I might be wrong. </TEXT>

Well, my situation is my dad has been unemployed most of his life. He's an unemployed, alcoholic, drug-addict abuser of a person. I saw lots of abuse and trauma growing up and I am so exhausted and my mind is fucked. I feel worthless, hopeless and do not want to exist.  
Friends tell me to suck it up and work hard. But I am drained, my mouth is always dry, rapid heartbeat, shaky hands etc. Feels hopeless.  
They lash out at me for being negative. Well, guess they'll only care when I am gone. </TEXT>

Also, despite thinking about suicide I never acted upon it and I am perceived as a good and kind human being. Feeling a little proud of myself today.

He'd speak for 10 minutes and then change the topic leaving me to keep my thoughts to myself. Now they just want me to pretend I am fine while he's getting married to show his soon to be wife and her family that we are "amazing" people. I just hate it because it is selfishness. Instead of helping me out everyone just says to be "happy" and "shit happens, no one gives a fuck, move on" etc. Well I can't. I am exhausted. It just sucks. I am depressed and at age 19 I am getting bombarded with not only my responsibilities but my older cousins as well because they are such a kid themselves that can't do anything on their own. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My friend is living my dream in front of me </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-25 10:28:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I wanted to be a singer(I know every teenager dreams of being a rockstar or a popular singer or a celebrity or something like that). I wanted to be one as well. I happened to become a friend of someone who was also interested in these things. Thing is long story short, I have had a tough life. My dad has been an unemployed, alcoholic, drug-addict, foul mouthed person all his life and obviously I have been quite poor and couldn't afford lots of things. I had to be grateful for even have my basic needs fulfilled. Not to mention on top of all of it I faced lots of abuse and trauma throughout my childhood and teen life.  
However, my friend has had a good life. I always see him happy and smiling. His dad was a government worker and earned lots of money(now retired). He still gets pension and I don't know how much money he must have saved. Nobody talks about that stuff. Again, my friend could afford lots of things as compared to me and never really had any restrictions. He could follow whatever his heart told him to. So he kept practicing singing and mixing mastering. He bought a laptop, a tab, a DSLR, a digital camera before that and everyone has smartphones in their house. Recently he bought an expensive microphone and he has started covering songs that are of good quality.  
I can't help but feel so jealous because I was fucked over for so many years and now I am depressed and hate my life so much and then just in front of me my friend is living my dream. It's like the universe has rubbed salt on my wounds. It makes me even more depressed to see that he might actually make his own dream come true. I know you would say if I had the talent I could become a singer as well. The thing is I accept I don't have a great voice. Even if everything was right in my life I still wouldn't be able to buy talent. Although I have a decent speaking voice(people have told me to become an RJ on a number of occasions) I simply do not have the singing voice.  
My main problem is I have no support network from anywhere now. My parents can't do anything and my relatives keep telling me to get a job and no one will even support my education anymore. I am kinda like on my own now.  
My friend won't help me either. It is his priority to look after himself first. He has explicitly told me that if he doesn't see his own benefit then he won't benefit anyone else which means he won't let me come at his house and record or just play around with microphone because he wants to get famous first.  
I just don't know what to do. If I didn't know him it would have been fine but he is a friend of 6 years and watching him grow makes me feel bad because I was getting fucked over and having suicidal thoughts when he was out there enjoying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But then again you can argue there is no right way to live. What you need at 17 might not be needed at 27 but who is to guarantee that? You never know what your perspective is going to be at a certain age. It is your life experiences and going out in the world that will shape you as a person. In that process you will always make mistakes and will continue to do so. At a certain age you might have your own set of values which are correct from your perception but not from anyone else. So many think they have it "figured out" but that is just not the case. We keep changing and until and unless the situation presents itself to you, you will never know how you're going to respond to them.  
At the end of the day we just have to accept whatever the situation is and go with the flow. This is life. No rules. No guarantees. Just try to do your best and accept you will never know everything. Also, as much as you want to help younger people to not repeat the same mistakes you did, the truth is that one can only learn by his/her experiences. Like I said earlier, no matter what happens you will always have to accept the situation that is there. Do not try to run away from circumstances. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Analogy to understand depression </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-23 13:38:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What does depression feel like? For those who don't understand it well consider this analogy:
Imagine yourself being trapped in a cage. You see others walking around you, you want to join them but you are bound in your cage that is only visible to you not anyone else. Others would wonder why you're like this because they can't see your cage but only you can. You're trapped and as much as you want to break free and join others you can't. 
It's suffocating to be trapped but you alone cannot get out of it. Depression feels like a trap and you cannot simply snap out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah you want to die but that tinge of hope keeps you alive that maybe some day, maybe one day things will get better. Wish I could help you but with depression, words or even actions can seem futile. Depression is more dangerous than most people realize. Happy people are too afraid to face it because it is dangerous and depressed ones have no choice but to accept the situation. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I don't breathe often </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> These days I am so overwhelmed and anxious that I don't breathe  for seconds. My heartbeat runs fast and my throat is always dry. My hands are shaky and I feel my brain is damaged. Perks of years of abuse and trauma. Sometimes I notice that I am not breathing and then have to make a conscious effort of breathing.  
I remember I used to get made fun of for being obese and to hide my fat I used to pull my stomach in and hold my breath so that people wouldn't make fun of my obesity. Funny thing is I wasn't that obese just a little but it was a big deal because my brother and cousin were athletic. It's a shame that most of the shaming came from them and my family and few friends.  
Maybe from there I got this habit of holding my breath. Anyway, well, I am so out of energy and I don't breath well. </TEXT>

It's sad people only truly care when you're gone. No one gives a shit when it actually matters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You would get me if you knew the real situation. Anyway, she asked me how she sounds like and I didn't say "you're horrible". I said you need more practice and with good work ethic you might have a chance but she got offended by that as well. Come on dude, telling someone to practice more to get better is offensive these days? Also, she doesn't even actually practice. Like I said, it's a wish of her but she hasn't been taking any action to achieve that dream. If you have a dream and you don't work towards achieving it then you are simply deluding yourself. You have to admit that.  </TEXT>

Do you really think a person has a chance when already talented people are having a hard time making it? Come on mate I am all for positive thinking but I don't want anyone to delude themselves. If she actually practiced I would have given her a chance but she is not serious about it and it's just a wish of her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I don't know what to believe anymore. I would like to be positive and all that but everything I do or plan to do with friends turns out as a failure. If I think "positive" I have a chance of being deluded. If I think "negative" no one will like me and my attitude. But why give yourself a sense of false hope? I like to dream but also plan things out to achieve that dream. I hate it when people have those hazy, unplanned dreams. They just want an outcome but don't want to put in work towards that. I have a friend who is horrible at singing and she wants a career in singing(she is 22 and older than me by 3 years). I told her she will have to practice a lot and put in some work on her voice but then she said I am demotivating her(wtf!). I told her the truth and she doesn't want to believe it. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I be "positive" and deluded or be "negative" and have realistic expectations? I just can't connect with a single human being these days. I feel I am very different and sort of broken as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A girl I was talking to keeps saying I am "negative". She has used this word too many times for me. Once I blocked her on fb and whatsapp because it was getting too much. I was getting emotionally hurt by her words. Like, ok I might be "negative" but why does she have the need to keep saying it again and again. Funny thing is she describes herself as a pessimist and yet keeps calling me "negative" and "I should talk about something positive". What the fuck?  
Anyway, I added her again on Facebook and got her number again after few months and initially it was fine but then she again started saying those things. I sometimes write poems to vent and express my emotions and she had a problem with that as well. She said "this poem is negative too". At that point I was fucking pissed off. Why the fuck is she trying to control me so much? Even if I am "too negative" for her why doesn't she ignore and find someone else?  
Last night we were having an okay conversation and she blurted out "You haven't said anything positive yet". I was like what the fuck, once again? I told her I am not the person you're looking for and told her we're never going to talk again in this life ever. Blocked her again from all forms of social media and have no intention to see her ever.  
Also note that we've been only texting and have never met so it was even more frustrating to see her judging me all the time.  
She has flaws as well. she is fat, she has a weak eyesight, is a pessimist, a nerd etc. But I never made fun of her or kept pointing out her flaws. I don't know why she had the need to do it to me. Last thing a depressed person is someone hurting him again and again. I only regret wasting my time with this girl and getting hurt. I wish I never talked to her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My father once said when I was younger that he would choose alcohol over his wife and kids(me and my brother) everyday of his life without any shame or hesitation. Alcohol has always mattered more to him than us. What annoys me more is the fact that he expects us to respect him just because he is the father. He wants us to take care of him when he is old. He spends money recklessly and has told me repeatedly not to spend much, That has left me so paranoid about money and I immediately feel so guilty if I spend some money on myself.  
Alcohol has always been his priority and nothing can separate him and his alcohol. I hate the fact I know such a shitty person like him. He never should have started his own family. I am not from USA so the society and culture are different here. </TEXT>

Why didn't he say anything?" Well, I try to say but it's too "negative", "too tiring", "my fault that I choose unhappiness" etc.  
Yeah, always my fault right? Dad is an alcoholic and a drug addict, my fault. Brother is outrageous and assault me, my fault. Mum doesn't listen, my fault. I don't have motivation, my fault.

Happiness is NOT a choice though? You can't have a switch that just turn off depression. Serotonin is a natural mood stabilizer and if that is messed up how can you just be "happy"? Won't you need medication to fix it? Probably exercising might help? But I hate it when people simply blame me for everything that has happened to me or that is happening? It's not my fucking fault that my father is a drug addict and an alcoholic. It's not my fault my brother outright assault me. It's not my fucking fault my mother does not want to listen to me. It's not my fault they do't give me any money. Tears are rolling down from my eyes now. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was one of the toppers in last year of high school but I have been out of school for 2 years and I dropped out from college this semester. I am quite clueless about what to do in life and naturally an anxious person. I had friends who failed a year back in school and were clearly less smarter than I was.   
Yet, the thing is one friend who was never good in studies but good in theater is now confident and has a job that pays quite well and he seems to be enjoying his life. One very close friend is into drugs, alcohol etc. and was never good in studies and even failed a year back in school but he is an entertainer who knows how to conduct himself in social situations. He also has a job right now because he isn't studying that doesn't pay well but at least he has a job.  
I feel very incompetent now. I have lost motivation, have no direction, I'm anxious, socially retarded, don't even have the courage to go for job interviews let alone doing a job and I feel exhausted all the time.  
I'd say I am a good thinker but I have  no qualifications or experience so that people might take me seriously. I can't put in 10 hours everyday for work everyday because I feel tired and just really have no motivation.  
So, despite all the grades and all the compliments I used to get about how smart I am, I feel so incompetent now because the people who were once behind me seems far ahead now. Looking for some motivation/advice. </TEXT>

I can feel the awkwardness when I am out with cousins and my brother is not around. He's the multi-talented, entertaining guy everyone wants to be around. I am the mood-killer. I always feel as if nobody wants me around.  
No matter how much they'll tell me that it's okay I can't help but feel they don't want me around. I am mentally exhausted. I just don't want to exist. I don't want to die...I just don't want to exist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anxiousness about everything. Then people also shame you by calling  you names and tell you to "calm the fuck down". It makes you question so many things. Sometimes your doubts are legit but people will tell you to not worry. Then you wonder about when you should be serious and when to just relax. It's hard to balance fun and seriousness.   
Then you wonder if over-analyzing is actually a strength or your weakness. You just start to wonder so many things and people tell you to calm down. It's a frustrating feeling of self-doubt.

<TEXT> Yeah, funny thing is they gave me shit for not trying hard for the entire year. But to be fair, they had a point because I missed many days because of shitty home life. Although, I was determined to score big as it was the last year. So, despite all the shit from home and school I succeeded. That gave me the belief that if I put effort I might actually achieve things in life. Overall, great experience! It was more than just marks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Invisible Man by H.G. Wells  
I read it like 10 times. I was in love with that book. I had to read it in 12th grade and I just loved imagining sitting by the fire drinking hot chocolate or something like that in an inn. Perhaps that was actual winter time so that also helped. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was jogging in the park at around 7 PM. I wasn't afraid of the dark and I was going at that time for a lot of days. That evening the park was quite empty as usual and I was simply exercising like any other day.  
A guy came up to me and asked me what time it is. I told him I don't have a watch or phone. I kept doing my business and thought he'd go away.  
After few seconds he came up to me from behind and started walking besides me. I didn't think much of it initially. Then he asked me "would you like to do setting?" That means "would you like to have sex?" in this context. I didn't understand what he said for first two or three times and then when he saw I couldn't get his point straight, he straight away went to grab my penis. He had just touched over the area lightly when I understood what he wants and I ran as fast as I could. I was scared and kept running. I got out of that park as quick was possible and then vowed never to go there in the dark.  
I have no problem with homosexuals but for fuck's sake don't go grabbing someone's penis without consent. That's sexual harassment.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I fulfilled my best friend's wish. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-29 14:30:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He has always been an enthusiastic and charismatic person. Ever since we both turned 17 I found a rejuvenated admiration for him in my heart.  No, I didnt think of him romantically. He was just like a brother from the other mother to me. Sounds clich but its the best description I could give. Wed do everything together. Wed sit in class with each other, would hangout after school, would play basketball sometimes, would talk about new YouTube channels we started watching. Heck, once there was a widespread rumor about us dating each other which always annoyed me because I was straight. I even had a crush on one of my classmate and she was beautiful and had been my fantasy for months.  

I ignored those rumors because I cherished my friendship more and I wouldnt give it away for a stupid rumor. We still played basketball with each other, discussed our favorite YouTube channels, sat in class with each other and didnt care about what anybody else thought Or so did I think. His behavior was odd for the past few days. Now that I was sitting in my room alone pondering over what happened during the week I realized things were not quite the same. What was going on? Why did it feel so different talking to him now? I tried to think about something else and brushed this feeling off as overreaction on my part.  

Just as I was about to go watch TV my phone rang. It was him. Bastard will have a long life I guess. I picked it up and he sounded upset. He told me to come over his house because he wanted to tell me something extremely important and he couldnt resist anymore. So, I walked over to his house which was a few blocks away.   

Hi, Mark! Good to see you. What do you want to tell me?
Sit down. It might not be easy for you.
Wh..What happened? Alls well?
Well, I have been pretty upset about those rumors you know. People tease me every day. They ask me how does it feel when youre in me and make nasty jokes. I am tired of this. He concluded as he sighed.
What do you want then? I asked sternly.
I want to get away from you. It is depressing to be made fun of by everyone. Look, youre like a brother to me. I would wish death over abandoning a great friend like you but its not healthy for me emotionally to continue this friendship. He was looking away as if not having the power to look me in the eyes and say it. 

Without saying a word I got out of his house and promised I would never bother him again. Few days passed but it was so awesome when we spent so much time with each other. I kept thinking about the old days.   

I thought and thought and decided I will see him for one last time. I called him and asked him to see me one last time. I told him I wanted to give him a present before we finally parted our ways. He reluctantly agreed. I got in my car and went over to his house.  

There he was, sitting on his couch, having no idea what goodbye present I was to give him thatd vanish all his depressive thoughts that he had been feeling these days. I told him to close his eyes and wait for it. He closed his eyes and I waited. Ready? I asked.  Um, yeah. With a cracking loud noise he fell to the ground. I had figured out shooting him in the forehead would give an instant result and I was obviously right.  

I kept repeating his words in my head. I would wish death over abandoning a great friend like you he had said. I had vowed to never bother him again. Well, Ill never bother him again. Its not my fault though. He had wished it over abandoning me. I just fulfilled his wish.   

If anything, I am proud to help my friend. After all, friends are there to help you, to help you turn your wishes into reality. I just turned his wish into reality.   

Police has been investigating his house to find a clue about his murderer since this morning. But why are they doing it? A friend has helped indeed to a friend in need. I did nothing wrong. I just fulfilled his wish.

<TEXT> I am similar.  
I actually dropped out this semester and the anxiety I get about future is horrible. I just don't know myself. I was declared a loser by most people but now people tell me I should believe in myself and work hard for success. I don't know what to believe. Am I a loser or not? If not, why everyone around me convinced me I am one for all these years? Why did they always point out my flaws? Why did they never believed in me? But now they imply you have only two options in life:  

1- Work hard and be successful.  
2- Be a loser and let the system decide your fate.  
Well, if that's the case shouldn't I had started working harder earlier in life instead of perceiving myself a loser? It's just so hard for me to know who I am now as a nineteen-year-old. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's one thing to get suggestions but I often feel my friends try to make decisions for me. Like, recently I dropped out of college due to many reasons. I took a long time to think about it and analyzed everything and concluded dropping out would be the best idea. Also, I was doing psychology so it isn't like I was sure to get a job after getting the BA. I knew it was the best decision for me because of my situation yet my friends would go like "OMG! don't drop out. Get the BA". Like it's the end of world if you drop psychology. It's quite annoying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trying to turn an okay friend into a lifelong friend. We're friends for 6 years but lately I realized how awful I feel around him. He keeps secrets, tells lies etc. Whenever I want to talk about me he just doesn't want to listen. He keeps talking about him and I started to feel as if I am living his life not my own as evident by the fact that I started thinking about same dreams as him but my life and his life are very different. I sort of feel I have wasted a lot of time with him when he clearly isn't the type of person to keep as a lifelong friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same here. But I also think people like us  just don't have any great raw talent to work with and/or we just don't have right resources and/or there's literally not a single person who'd help us in achieving our dreams/goals.  
If you take out any famous or successful person you'll see they always had sheer luck or people helping them or natural raw talent to work with.  
Basically it's our fault but not entirely. Luck is a huge factor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1- You will need your friends one day. You might not realize it but make sure to keep your friends close because they're your family outside of immediate family.  

2- Don't think you're invincible or perfect. More often you'd not be able to do things alone, make sure to appreciate the people in your lives. Many of us take them for granted.  

3- It's not necessary to be super talented or super famous like Harry Potter to get girls. You just have to express yourself and don't hold back. Confidence can take you far instead of fame.  

4- Love genuinely if you want to love someone.  

5- Remember one moment can change your life for the better or worse. Be humble.  

6- Last but not the least it feels awesome to fuck your best friend's sister! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well for starters he hacked my facebook account few years ago and read my private messages. He then posted shit about me on a website and pretended he doesn't know who did it. When I  found out it was him I wanted to beat the shit out of him but for some reason, I decided it was a mistake and let it go.  
After maybe 1  or two years he DID it again but this time only read my messages and didn't post shit about me. I felt betrayed but I still forgave him.  
Then when I was having the hardest time in my life because of my alcoholic father I needed someone to brighten my day. He vanished and I was alone battling domestic violence and emotional pain. Turns out he had a girlfriend for 1 and a half year and he only told me about it when they broke up. So, telling me when it was all done and dusted was pointless and he used to vent about it in front of me because I listened. When I tried to talk about the REAL bad things that have happened to me, i.e, talking about job pressure at the age of 17-18 by my relatives(because my dad doesn't work and they're tired of giving us money), my mother being ill, facing the domestic violence, getting shit from teachers for not  focusing enough, getting ignored by girls, emotional and mental pain etc. he would say "let's talk about something else, something positive etc." Told me to think positive when REALLY BAD things are clearly happening to me.  
I told him about my crush and she obviously rejected me(who wouldn't because I have been through shit and I can't have "fun" and I am not "fun" to be around), the douchebag started talking to her and would show me their conversations( those were only friendly though) and would show me her pics deliberately when I was trying to forget about her.  
Once my phone got stolen when we were walking and he suspected that it might happen. What he does then? Instead of dragging me along he walked ahead leaving me behind and I didn't see it coming and it got stolen. He later told me thieves are stealing stuff with this approach these days in this area. If only he told me before or at least dragged me along with him and not leave me behind my phone would have been saved.  
He keeps telling me I am lazy when I am clearly down and depressed these days. The clown actually studies psychology and claims to "know" lots of things about it yet can't see it when a person is depressed(FYI I was a psychology student as well and people tell me I am a great listener).  
Lastly, he helps out the people who only talk to him when they need something but I have been with him when he needed someone the most and yet he always screws me up.  
I am currently enrolled in a course with him and I would like to get away from him permanently once it finishes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, you're still young and life is more than high school bullshit. Believe me, it won't matter once you graduate. Working out and going to the gym can turn your life around. Pick up an art as a hobby as well. People love art and girls like muscular guys. If you have both of them to an extent then you can lead an average life at least. That's what I think.  
People think I am a "cool" dude because I look somewhat good and I do artsy stuff especially poetry. I also run fast and I am somewhat fit but not muscular. It's just my depression keeps telling me how big of a loser I am but most people from outside think I am "cool". They don't mind talking to me. Depression is hell but having hobbies and working out will make you more presentable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long story short I just can't move on. I had a rough childhood and to this day I am unable to move on. I am 19 and male. I see people around me having fun, going out with their gf/bf/friends etc., building new relationships and having a grand time. Here I am stuck in my mind. Lost motivation, lost my will to live. I don't enjoy anything. I am bitter and that drives people away. Apparently, no one wants a bitter guy in their life. No one gives a toss about me. Hell! I don't care. I myself don't give a fuck about me so it doesn't matter if someone else does.  
I don't know if I will ever be able to get out of this. It's 3:45 AM and I am typing this stuff right now because I can't sleep! I get ridiculed for sleeping too much while in reality I usually sleep in the morning and never at night. Why the fuck people don't understand that my father was an alcoholic douche who used to claim he was a "nice" and "innocent" guy?I have went through abuse and no one gives a single fuck! They just want me to pretend I am happy because they want only "happy people" in their life.  
At this point I have no friends and no one who genuinely cares. Please give me some advice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a friend who did some bad shit to me as adolescents. I thought I should ignore it and tried to forget it. It's now 6 years of our friendship and I realize how miserable I feel. He keeps talking about him and I have faced real troubles yet he won't listen to me.  
The friendship sucks and I was right back then when I thought of boycotting him. My life gets 10x worse when I am with him. It's best to drift apart. In hindsight, this friendship has really sucked and probably one of the worst I have ever had. Funny thing is people usually think we're best friends(lol). The reality is it's the  shittiest friendship ever which has gone on to 6 years! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a friend like this as well. He used to steal other's songs and claim he sung it. Now a days he keeps sending small audio clips of either music or him singing to impress people. He once said "girls love musicians". While I think that is true, another important thing to note  is that to build a relationship you still need to care about the other person and get to know them.  
All he does is send these clips on whatsapp and then proceeds on to ignore others. I have a project to make with him which we had to complete within 2 weeks and now we have taken over 5-6 weeks because apparently he's always "busy". Well, I think he has to set his priorities straight and do the work that matters. Sorry for the rant but I can understand how you feel. I hate pretentious bastards like that. I plan on to cut contact with this guy once I finish this project. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend keeps sending audio files on whatsapp to many people. Well, I don't know his intentions but it comes across as showing off to me. It's okay to get feedback but sending your audio  every other day to so many people seems as if he's just trying to impress them. I don't tell him it's weird because he once said "My life, my rules" over something. So, I don't bother telling him much these days. </TEXT>

You should take comfort in knowing that there are truly broken souls like me who sleeps away at least 8-12 hours a day. I am really scared for myself because I don't have motivation for anything. You're better off as compared to a lot of people. Hang in there!  
Also, it will be good for you to relax once in a while. I suggest body massage or just a hot bath after a long day. You can try meditation if you want as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. We were 16 and I was "hungover" due to no sleep and felt weird when I woke up. I was an idiot but I felt it'd be a bad idea to have sex because I was previously thinking with my dick and now that I had slept for a while, having sex felt quite risky. So, I told her we can't do it and then she got SUPER PISSED and said why I asked if I wasn't serious. I told her that I was quite "hungover" and horny  without sleep and she just told me to never contact her again. She felt embarrassed maybe.  
I felt bad and apologized. Blocked her on FB I think. After maybe one or two years I added her again and we text sometimes but doesn't feel like we're friends. Just occasional texts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You get girls without even trying. People love you and would compliment you even when you do something badly because of your charm. You will be ahead at your workplace. They'll consider you smart based on your looks. Believe it or not being attractive puts you ahead and not so good looking usually remains in the shadow of them.  
P.S I am not incredibly attractive but somewhat good looking because even in my depressive phase few girls would come to me knowing I don't have much to offer. I have seen very attractive people and life is somewhat easier for them. </TEXT>

I have suppressed loads of things but one thing stands out is my friend who I considered my best friend didn't tell me about a lot of things for a long time and I was friends with him since 9th grade. It devastated me because I thought we were best friends. Then I kept wondering if I actually even knew this person or not for all these years. I was really into at least 3 girls and they all rejected me. My self esteem went down and I was feel as if people just don't like me now. I am too afraid to go out there and express myself. There are plenty other bad things that have happened and I am not sure if I can write them out right now. </TEXT>

My three kids. They all look a little bit like me/you, and certain aspects of their personalities are similar, but the middle one is way more outgoing than I am, the older one is a little more intraverted, And the little one is a girl. Can you believe I have a daughter?

<TEXT> Don't take internet too seriously. Your life lies outside of virtual world. Nobody on the  internet knows you so they can't make decisions for you. Your facebook or instagram likes means nothing. They don't land you anywhere. Do things that will make you a better person and don't spend too much time in front of a screen. Also, you never know who's behind the screen you're talking to. It could be an interesting person or it  could  be a loser in his  30s or  40s who has no job and sucks at life giving you advice on philosophical or academic queries. Lastly, just live your life. Go  out with  friends, party like crazy, ask out girls/boys, make mistakes and learn from it, take your  studies seriously and hit the gym.  
Ironically, I am a stranger on internet and you shouldn't take my advice too seriously either but that's the whole point. You is you and nobody can take  place of  you.  So, go out there, live, make mistakes, learn and move on. </TEXT>

So, I stopped talking to him for a  while like 6-7 days and after that he was more enthusiastic to  see me and the conversation went smoothly. I guess it's about giving space to people and if that doesn't work then  straight up tell  them to discuss something else.  
Not sure if a break will help you guys but it is  a suggestion. </TEXT>

People are easily replaceable now. You can add tons of  people  on social  media to  distract yourself. You can talk  to  someone else if  one annoys you. Basically, we are losing  meaningful friendships and relationships because  replacing them has become easier  than  ever.  
Likes and followers on  social media gives people a false ego boost. They start to  think they are the real deal while in reality no one cares   about their likes.  </TEXT>

As much as the society doesn't accept it,  truth is  that looks will always give you an upper hand and wealth will always  determine your value in the society. Poor person has no  friends or at least not more than a handful. World is a cruel place for many people. Life is just so absurd. One  day you are  living  and  the very next day you might not be here. Seems so surreal. It's like an illusion.

<TEXT> Yes. You know what sucks more? When I started college  I hung out with different people and most of the girls I hung out with kept glued to their phones not talking to me when I was right in front of them. I tried talking to them and they'd talk back  but immediately after  replying would check their phones again. It was quite disrespectful and I started questioning myself. But  then most of the girls were doing this and I just thought  maybe that's what today's  people actually enjoying doing. It was so stupid.  
Or maybe there is something wrong with me but really people are always glued  to  their phones now a days. A lot of people would rather text than  to talk face to face. </TEXT>

Until I saw you and met a beautiful soul  


Youre a diamond among dull stones  


I admire you so much,  


You might never get to know.  


 

Keep moving forward, the world is yours  


Ill stay here and remain indoors  


All my troubles, I wont allow to be seen  


I will live like a slave but will make you my queen.

<TEXT> My close friend talking about him and his relatives all the time. And the guy gets upset when  I talk about job struggles as we are college  students and  it's going to be  tough for us when the pressure rises to get one. He says I am "overwhelming" him with that stuff but if he doesn't acknowledge it then it's going  to  hit him so suddenly. I don't see any point in running  away from  real world stuff.  
The thing that annoys me is that he tries to filter the conversation. When I talk about anything that might be uncomfortable for him he starts telling me he doesn't want to  listen  but then he'd bore me to death by talking about his relatives/cousins and himself. Also, he refuses to appreciate anyone else's art and thinks he is hot shit. He has  a decent singing voice and  he records small clips of him singing then  goes on  to send those clips to  everyone he knows. It was okay at first as I thought the guy just wants feedback but it's been  getting ridiculous because he starts sending the audio clips as soon as he meets someone  new. As if he is just trying to impress others and is not too serious about singing. Also, he  sends the  audio mostly to girls and not guys. I have really started to feel that he is just trying  to impress girls and that looks like a huge show off.  
I would like to call him out but we have  been friends for a long time and I'd see him regularly for 2-3 months more or maybe 1-2 months more  then I am planning to slowly drift away. It feels  like our friendship has been getting dragged for a long time now because instead of feeling good about seeing him I have started to feel annoyed  by him. I think we have  changed a lot. I want to maintain the peace so I wouldn't want to end it on bad  terms.  
I am telling myself to keep at it and after  a few months I'll be able to move on with my life and then see him once in a while. Some people might perceive me to be a "bad" friend here but honestly, I think as a friend it is his duty as well to listen to me and let me express myself freely. I think if I am having a trouble regarding something then he needs to listen and offer advice. During our conversations, it's mostly him speaking and me listening. I think once in a  while, he  should let me express  myself too and just listen but nope, it doesn't happen.  
Now just the several weeks back, I was talking to him about my worry for money as my dad  hasn't been working for years and my relatives are pressuring me to find any job because..well, my father doesn't work and he never will. So, I was  telling him that I am getting desperate for money and the next day dude  comes up to me  and tells me he has found a website that pays for clicking ads. Then he goes on to tell me about a  trick he discovered  that  allows him to  watch more ads than he can with a standard membership. I was like "you're a great guy, buddy. Helping me out like this. Now, tell me the trick so that I can earn more money as  well." The dude refuses  to tell me the trick and says it's for only  him and he won't tell anybody including me. I was like "wtf dude! Then why the fucking hell you told me  you had  found a trick?" It felt as if he was rubbing salt on my wound. Thankfully, due to my good brain I found an alternate  way to make some money  but jeez! I shouldn't be hanging  out with a guy who knowingly tries to fuck  with me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that guy is me now a days. I often say things  in a  heartbeat  these days to people  because I  never give a fuck about what  they think. If it hurts them, let it hurt.  
Recently a girl who I know sent an audio clip of her singing  and I straight up  told her she  needs  a  lot of practice while  others  were giving  her  false appreciation.  
Also, I always imagine if some  day somebody laughs at me for doing whatever thing I am doing, I will tell them that- "Laughing at  me  won't  make your life better."  
I have been being too honest these days and people often assume I am being a pessimist while in reality I am just being a realist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So far dropping out of college after  being  1.5 years in. I dropped out in 4th semester and it's a 3 year degree  in my country. I dropped out due to a number of  factors but mainly it was due to very poor grades. I wasn't ready  for college and I got thrown  into one  where I had  to commute daily for 3 hours overall. I  think it could have been  prevented  very easily if I  treated it just like school as  in  my country, there really  is no party culture and people live at  home so being in college is a lot like high school 2.0. I could have   gotten average  grades simply by showing up and taking  tests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found it better than any other social media. It's like it's a club which has clubs within it(subreddits).  
You can join anything that suits you and it's entertaining. Much better than Facebook, twitter, instagram and snapchat. People really connect with each  other here with stories and it's  a fun place  as well.  
Facebook glamorizes the lives of  people  and it's  not  a true portrayal of real life.  
Reddit can be  a huge waste of  time  as well  depending on how you use  it but  it is  surely more entertaining than  any other social media. </TEXT>

These two are the things I just don't do.  
I have never had a girlfriend who cared about me. Few were interested for  superficial reasons(my face) but no one  emotionally attached to me. I have had 3-4 severe crushes  and they  all broke my heart before we even became  friends. I mean they just  refused to understand me and talk to me as if I am some dirty thing  that shouldn't  be around them. Fuck them man!  
I also try not to  be as nice to people as I was. They seem to think being nice means weak. They try to take advantage of you if you're too nice.  
I am quite apathetic now and I don't give a fuck about  anyone including myself. Now I just want a job that can make sure I survive. I don't want to live(not suicidal) and I just do not want to enjoy my life. It will be taken away and that fear stops me from loving life again. I just don't  want to do anything.

I really wanted to be a psychologist  but my financial conditions have always been shitty throughout my life and psychology requires lots of schooling otherwise there are not  a lot of options in it and I just can't handle the classroom environment. I  was never regular  in school either. I prefer getting books, studying by myself and just go  to give exams. It is  possible  to do that in my country but  my parents  refuse to do that. Anyway, that's a different topic.   
Basically, I wanted  to  be a psychologist  but now I am considering a  change of  plan. I'd be okay with a short term accounting certificate  and get an okay paying  job. I'd  be  fine with less money, less human interaction and lots  of free time as I  don't enjoy doing  anything really.

I don't know myself very well. I do not know much about my likes/dislikes, strengths/weaknesses, specific goals etc. I have low confidence and I just keep thinking  about "doing something". I don't know  what  but I know I will need a career at some point and a  direction in my life. I am  so lost. I have no idea what to do with my life. I  was just going through school without enjoying it and  in the process I  simply forgot that I need to relax a little as well. I have so many questions but no answers. I see my friends setting goals, get  the girls, have fun in life etc and here I am, full of insecurities and no goals etc. Even  today I skipped a college class as  I  am not  sure if I even want to pursue this degree. I guess the end is near for me. </TEXT>

Don't take this in a bad way.  I just wanted   to  give you some  suggestions because  if you keep living this  way, you're going  to  learn the hard way just like me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have played video games, watched movies, used internet in my free time and played outside with friends a lot less during my childhood and teen  years(19 now). Believe me, getting back to the real world from the virtual world has been so difficult so  far because I had gotten used to be at my computer all day for so many years.  
When I started going outside again, it was HELL. I  was so out of touch  with reality  and for one  year I was in  a dream  like state. It  caused me anxiety and possibly depression because the days were overwhelming as I was out for whole day.  
I wish  I  had done extra curricular activities and did something productive. Also, playing outside  would have  increased my contacts and I wouldn't be so out of touch. Believe me, playing video games etc doesn't do any good and it just wastes your time if you cannot find the balance. However, all was not my fault. My father discouraged me from going out but that's a whole another story.  
Bottom line is, you did the right  thing by being productive back  in the day.  
P.S I  should maybe start learning coding if I just wants to sit  in  front of a screen. Maybe  that'd be a good idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being a good writer is more about marketing your book well.  
It's such a subjective field  that  there are no set rules. I have seen novices getting heavily criticized not just because of their mistakes  but also because there is this  mindset that "hey, he's just  starting  out, he can't be that good. Let me  find out the loopholes in his plot/grammar etc.  and make sure he puts a better version  next  time."   
I  am  not saying novices are perfect, it's just  that  any  art field is more about building connections and be appealing to the audience.  Knowledge and information  are the basic foundation of your book  but most  of  the work is just marketing yourself  well and hope to  get lucky.   
Probably, this is  why artistic fields are toughest to  get into. </TEXT>

So, I am glad I won't have any debt when I graduate as I am attending a state  university which is  hard to get into. I feel sorry for students of USA who graduate with debt. That's a  lot of pressure. Even being in an inexpensive school stresses me time to time as job searching would be hard.  
Although I am sure I will have a roof over my  head, 3 meals everyday, clothes to wear, computer,wifi etc for a long time so I shouldn't worry but hey, the pressure to do something with my life is always there.  
However, it sucks for debt ridden students and I certainly have it better than most of world's population. </TEXT>

I  want  to drop out and find an alternate path  to  get  the degree. I  can  opt for school  of  open learning and I think that will suit  me. But my brother has dropped out  3 times already and never held  a job plus he  spends a lot  of money so  my family is reluctant to let  me  drop out.  
It sucks man!  My family expects way  too much as well and I don't like it. All my life I have felt I have been running away from  stuff and  I am too afraid to live.  
My dad is lazy  and  has  always ran  away  from  responsibilities and I am just  tired of this existence now.  
Sorry, I started rambling. My point is it sucks  for most of  us and we are in this together.  Sheesh! sometimes I  feel like we  should all live  together like roommates and make sure  the  burden is  reduced on each individual lol.

<TEXT> Look, I  am not from  USA  so I can't give  you technical  details but  I think  one thing to achieve  anything  in  life  is  pure  determination. When I  was a  senior in high school, it  was  like I was  possessed by  a higher power. I was too determined to  achieve my  goal  even  though  people around me never believed  in me  and  rightly  so   because I  never  gave a reason to believe  in me prior to that year.   
However, I REALLY wanted to  end my school career  on a high so I just  REALLY wanted  it badly.  
What I did was, turned off social media  completely for about 3  months prior to my final  exams and  studied my ass off.  
There is no shortcut in any field mate. You  want better  grades?  Simple. Study smart  and work hard.  
Unfortunately, I have  lost  that  motivation  I had  back  in school after  I achieved my goal and  hence, I   haven't  done  much since then but  at least it gave me the confidence that hard work  can  beat talent  and  pure determination makes everything possible.  
As far as college is  concerned, I'd say  choose a major you're passionate about. Also, if you're  going to take student loans then you will  have to be careful about  the major you choose. Based on my reading  on the internet, community college  seems like a good idea as it saves you from debt. You can always transfer   later anyway. </TEXT>

I would even search things like  "Why  am I a loser"  on Google lol.
Also, I allowed  my family to convince me that  there was something wrong with me.  Turns out  they are probably insecure and depressed themselves and  there  are not many things wrong about me.  In  fact,  I  am a pretty good  thinker and wise for my age  as well.

<TEXT> That I have been one of the toppers in last year of high school despite having an alcoholic and abusive unemployed father which made me suicidal every day and gave me anxiety attacks which still makes it hard for me to go out.  
I had to score more than 90% to get my name on the toppers board while having a terrible home life, teachers putting me down and saying I might fail in few subjects, getting shit from them for being irregular in school, getting shit from my brother who thought I was not good enough to achieve this goal and working hard on my subjects but getting overshadowed in few subjects from a close friend because of his good image among the teachers.  
Really, no one believed in me including my family and friends. Naturally, I also, at times, thought I'll never be able to get it but I worked extremely hard. I even burned out after that year but I did it.  
Pressure was real because two years prior my own awesome brother had scored 92+% and the year before my close cousin had got 95%.  I didn't want to be the odd one out and I really wanted to prove my doubters wrong so I worked hard but got shit from the people around me during the entire year.  
It was a terrible phase because it was already hard to work while going through the abuse then it became even harder when no one believed in me and didn't encourage me.  
I can proudly say I was one of the topper but I am even prouder considering the circumstances I was in. It was more than just being the topper. It was the moment that for the first time in my life I had felt if I work hard then I can achieve my dreams. I felt nothing was impossible. I felt I had control of my life and I, for the first time, had realized I can choose to alter my actions if I want a different result.  
For some, it's a normal thing to top but for a guy like me who had never even scored 70% during my entire life, it was a great moment when I had scored 90%+ during the last year of my school.  
My friend from whom I was getting overshadowed got 82-point-something and I 90.75.  
Few friends were shocked that I did that well and few were shocked that I  did better than my friend.  
It was like I grew up immensely after that year.  
That friend is still my friend. </TEXT>

Trouble is I feel I am a bipolar and has social anxiety but my parents won't believe it. According to them, it can't happen to someone as young as me(lol). They do not take me  seriously and needless to  say, my father sort of doesn't exist because he is an emotional burden to me and refuses to talk or  teach me anything.  
I realize psychological disorders can  ruin  a person's life so it's understandable why he is so incapable but the trouble is I  am sort of like him as well and I feel I won't reach anywhere in life because I am too anxious for  everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that I came across as a huge creeper but at least she could have talked to me and become friends. But no, she decided to treat me like garbage because I was a weird kid lol.  Actually, life is not that bad right now. Since then, I started working out a bit and the next year, few girls were actually flirting with me. Come to think of it, I have improved a lot since then and even got perceived as a likable person once I developed hobbies and started giving no fucks about anything.  
It is better now and I am waiting to graduate college and look for a job in near future. Hoping for a better future. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 13, I had my first love. I became so brave that I was ready to  fight the world. I did things for her openly. I even gave her love letters in front of everyone in the class when teacher was not there. Any girl would at least appreciate the effort but she was quite arrogant because she was very smart and maybe she thought I was not good enough to be her friend let alone boyfriend. So, what happens is I do things for her, everyone realizes I am in love with her but she just refuses to even talk to me. Not her fault though, I was a weird kid and she was highly intelligent. Becoming friends with me would have hurt her reputation despite me being actually decent looking.  
Finally I decided to give her a birthday present and she refused to even take that. Although it was just a pen but I had already spent money on it and I had bought it for her so I wanted to give it to her. I tell one of our mutual friend to give it to her and he does that. She takes it but later as soon as she gets in the van to go home, she threw that gift out of the window. Ouch! That really hurt me. I was still in  love though. I tried talking to her next day and she refused to talk again. 
 At this point, even her friends are tired of all the drama and they tell her that she is being really rude and she should at least talk to me but she still refuses to talk. As few days goes on and this drama continues she finally gets too tired and  threaten to rat me out and get the teacher involved.  
I don't take  her seriously and ....it happens. She tells the teacher. I go and meet her and she lectures me about how I am being a creep and I should stop this inappropriate behavior. So, I felt defeated. I grew hatred towards her now. All this love vanished in a moment. I felt awful. From next day, I stopped trying to talk  to her but the urge was still there. But I was defeated. I could have had a time of my life but instead I was left embarrassed. My peers repeatedly made fun of me everyday for the rest of the year and I was just waiting for the year to be over.  
I never gained the confidence to ask a girl out since that incident and to this day, I have low self esteem and I do not talk to girls very openly. I am very reserved and a bit anxious too but that has happened because of plenty of horrible things.  
I felt awful and way too embarrassed that year. My most embarrassing year ever.  
However, I wouldn't blame her. She was super smart and beautiful and deserved better than me. I was a weird, over sensitive kid who used to cry on little things (hate to admit this) and an average in academics. Looking back, I really did not deserve to be her boyfriend but maybe friendship was not such a big deal. Also, acting like a creep did not help my case but I can't blame myself for that. I had felt I was in love for the first time ever.....and it ended so horribly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But my experience says, arranged marriages last long because the couple are too dumb to go separate ways. They were never confident enough to get a date  by themselves and choose their partners for themselves. So, even if their marriage is failing they won't divorce each other. I have seen PLENTY of unhappy couples in India and in many cases women suffer from domestic violence and they don't utter a single word against it. Plenty of them are too weak to leave the man no matter how bad the situation gets. Also, men have to make sacrifices as well but you get my point about the divorce rate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing really. But I'd like to have a good start and a better year. I feel like I have wasted a lot of time (I am 19).  
I'd like to take my studies more seriously. Find some new friends. In 2015, I had hit rock bottom and I was completely hopeless and had lost the will to live. I am better this year but still pretty indifferent to anything. I see other people happy, having friends, in relationships, just having a great time etc. and here I am finding it hard to enjoy anything. Sometimes I look at other people and feel "Wish I was you".  
I'd like to see how it pans out and I want to improve myself. My goal at 19 is to find true happiness, great people, great experiences and financial independence. I am already a minimalist and I am careful with money. I am confident that things can get better but there is not one particular thing I am looking forward to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still talk to him but it's different now. I later found out that we were never as close as  I  thought we  were. He betrayed me several times. Kept secrets with me. We are friends  since 9th grade and  now we are in second year of college. Everyone looks  at us and  says that we are best  friends. Little do they know we are not even proper friends. I still see him every other morning three days a week because we are doing another course together in an institute. It will end in February. I have started to feel that will be the end of our friendship as well. Not that I don't like him. We are like minded and pretty comfortable with each other but I am not sure if I can trust him anymore and there's just a feeling somewhere in my heart that this friendship has reached its end a long time ago and I have been dragging it along for a while. </TEXT>

Way beyond anyone's dreams.
Look out for me and see above,
For you'll only find me when you look up.

I have got to go and see the galaxy.
Broken the shackles, no more mundane activities.
New adventure is out there, waiting for me.
So I'll go now and fetch myself a sublime dream.

A shimmering shoreline is ahead of me.
Gentle tides wavers my worries.
Voice of an angel sounds so soothing.
Watching beauty of the nature is amusing.

Sunset gives me a new hope.
I am assured there'll be a new day coming for sure.
I want to meet my future self soon.
Till then, reverie will make me stay on the moon. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trouble with college? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-10 17:27:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a problem with college.  I am in my third semester and I live in an Asian country(I know Americans might not be the best to help because you are not aware of my societal and cultural settings but still any advice is appreciated because no one around me understands my situation).  So, here's the story: I am currently pursuing a BA(Honors) in Applied Psychology. Here, BA is a 3-year course. I am in one of the most reputed universities in  my country and I was one of the topper in high school so I had to work pretty hard to get here because the admissions are given on merit base and the cut-off is very high due to so much competition. So, I worked hard and got here.  
But the thing is, I have been wanting to drop out from this college. I  have lived a sheltered life as a kid and  I grew up in an abusive environment (my  father was an  alcoholic  and used to beat us up  when drunk). Long story short, I failed to make a transition from high school to college because I have never had any good  experiences and I have developed anxiety and depression to some extent(not diagnosed yet). So, I skipped a lot  of classes during my semester 1 but my real problems started in semester 2. I didn't go a single day for an entire semester and went straight to practicals examination and my teachers(3-4 of  them) yelled the hell out and gave me another mental  trauma. Then I became even more scared and when third semester started, I became extremely hopeless, I started dreading going to the lab and it didn't help that I missed two straight weeks initially so my professors have been throwing taunts at me since third semester and now I have a very low self esteem and my professors thinks I am an unreliable pathetic loser who doesn't deserve to be in this course anymore.  I  feel so trapped now. I am trapped in my mind. My parents have told me to  not even think  about dropping out but I can't take their(professors) insults anymore. My mother has suggested that she can come and talk to them but I am 19 and since I have been 14-15 I have been sort of alone in my battles  because my father was such a reckless and careless person and my brother used to make fun of me in everything. So, it  feels weird  that I am  officially an adult now and would need my mum to talk to my professors. I  would like to handle it all by myself. I am just so unmotivated to finish  the degree. I want to change my path and change my major but...I am in a huge dilemma because dropping out is never an option for my parents. I need some advice.  Also, a great point to be noted is I am in no debt and university fees is pretty low so I am not in a huge financial trouble or accumulated any debt.  
TL;DR: I feel like I am in depression. I can't tolerate college anymore. My parents won't allow me to drop out. I feel trapped. I sometimes think about suicide too. Need some advice. </TEXT>

I live in Asia(won't tell you the country) and things are different here, very, very different. I might have mental illness too. I don't know but I assure you I haven't made anything up. I think they allowed me to write the exam because they took mercy on me? I don't know. I seriously don't know why they allowed me. I thought I would get expelled right then and there but I didn't. That's why I stated again and again that "miraculously" I passed everything. Also, if you go by the brand value then it's the best university to be at in the entire country, but only reputation wise, infrastructure is terrible. 
Again, I am not an American and you probably haven't even visited my country ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Semester 2. I literally attended only 3 days during the entire semester. My subject includes practical/lab work as well and yet I remained  an absentee for so long.
Looking back, I realize I had terrible  anxiety  and I can't believe I was in such a dark place and yet I didn't kill myself. 
I used to dread before leaving for college and my throat would dry up completely and I had irrational and intense fears like my professor is going to yell at me, I will do some stupid stuff etc. I don't know, those were just irrational. 
Fast  forward and we had the practical exam coming up. I hadn't done any lab work and I was SCARED. I was really SCARED. I was actually HORRIFIED thinking about going for the exam.  I did it anyway because my mom said me to go and my parents were just against dropping out. They would let me face the humiliation but wouldn't let me drop out. So, I go there. Commuting 1.5 hours and scared as hell. As it turns out, I put on a brave face, I  go in there and straight away I get smashed all over the place. Not a physical assault but 3-4 professors started yelling at me together. I was HORRIFIED. They kept shouting and shouting and told me to call my parents. I had to tell them the truth. I told them I live quite far away and my father has mental illnesses. He was an alcoholic too and I had the one of the most traumatic childhood ever on the planet. I told them I was burnt out. I was psychologically burdened and emotionally traumatized. I had given up on life when I turned 18 and I was full of apathy. I usually put on a somewhat normal  face when I am out so they just told me I should have told them earlier. Anyway, they refused to let me take the exam but miraculously one professor  showed some mercy and allowed me to sit in the lab and write the exam. I just didn't know how to do it so all I did was some random bullshit. I wrote complete nonsense but I did it. 
I was sure I was going to fail the entire semester but again, miraculously, I got my results and I saw I have passed everything. 
Due to new grading system, they don't put lab/practical grades on our transcript but due to the fact I hadn't attended any classes all semester they thought I was going to flunk even the theory exams. I even got a B grade in stats exam and I hadn't even given internals. Internal assessment was of 25 marks and the theory exam was of 75 marks. I passed everything and here I am, in my third semester, knowing fully well I have successfully cleared one year of college and few of my regular coming classmates have to re appear in few exams. I, miraculously, dodged the bullet and cleared everything.  I want to make it clear I am still not fully well and I am still full of apathy but it's better this year. I am actually giving a fuck about doing the work a bit this semester.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. I never tried making friends deliberately in high school and just allowed it to happen naturally but in hindsight, that was not completely right way to approach this. Now  I am at college.
When you're in college, sometimes, you have to make things happen rather than just sit around and wait. All OP did was ask her out for a coffee. He's just saying Hi to people. How else is he going to introduce himself? You have to start somewhere I guess and someone has to initiate it. At most, the girl should have politely or indirectly told him that she has a boyfriend and make it clear that she'd be only friends with him, nothing else. Or she could have just played it cool and talk. Calling her boyfriend over this was an overreaction. It's not like he wants to sleep with her anyway.

<TEXT> Stay there man! When  I turned 18 I had given up  on life but I just thought "I have already come so far now, might as well see what happens in the upcoming years". The positive perspective for me is I thought I had hit rock bottom and the only way was up so now when I do get sad and have bad days I just remind myself that it used to be so worse than this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the fact that my life hasn't  changed much. I always  thought I am making progress and changing myself but now I look back I realize I am still like I was before. I am 19 now and I thought as I grow up, I will stop worrying about littlest of things but I guess it's in my genes to get  worked up and trapped in my mind. I might  have anxiety, I don't know.  Also, I used to  think school was the problem in my life and as soon as I graduate high school I will be  a  different person but I have  fallen back to that same mindset.  I have realized school was not the problem. I was. It was me  who wasn't creative/intelligent/athletic enough. School actually  offered lots of opportunities. I was the one who blew it. Even now, I have some days where I feel everything is perfect then I get days like today where I feel the future is bleak. After so  much introspection, after so  much walking and  wondering in the park, after all the time I have allowed myself to think things through,  I still feel I haven't made significant changes in my life.
I started to think maybe earning money will solve my problem but now I think it won't. The simple fact I have learned is that the external environment is just not the problem. The problem lies with in me. Despite knowing the answers, I fail to implement and execute my plans.
My 13 year old would be  glad I am still going strong and I have proved many doubters  wrong. He would be proud that I am  still trying but he would be disappointed  that I haven't turned everything around  and to learn the fact that external factors were never the problem. It was  all inside him all along. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know much about technicalities of the subject but all I can say is you're not alone in this so don't beat yourself over it. Maybe use online sources? There are plenty to help you out. Get a study buddy who might motivate you  and help you out where you make errors? I  have a  friend who usually helps  me out when I am stuck. Although I don't like  that  I usually have to take the help because it hurts my ego but sometimes  you got to accept you're not the best and seek  help. Sorry if  it is not much help  but that's all I can offer right  now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It gets real hard and especially initially people  are scared because it's all new. Once you get the hang of it and get used to it most people simply realize worrying won't do anything. Even if they worry  they are  good at hiding it because showing that  you're worried  might put other people off  and bring down the morale of everyone else. So, the best thing is to face it and see what happens. Oh, and also, it's not like you're going to be beaten up or anything like that so why worry that much lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am relating to this SO DAMN FUCKING HARD!  I felt  the exact same way when I came to college initially. I am in second year and I feel a whole lot more comfortable  this year  but that spark is just not there. Back in elementary, middle and high school it used to feel so warm and pleasant. I felt real connections with my friends. Maybe, we don't feel so connected now because we are aware people can be double faced and it's just not a good idea to open up too much because that might bring unnecessary drama in your life.  I don't have a lot of solutions for this but I think you just need to make sure you interact with your friends.  Keep yourself open and keep doing things. You might make a friend when you're least expecting it.  This funny thing happened to me. By the time I came to college in my first year I had given up on life and I was merely existing. I was really depressed and burn out due to constant nagging from teachers and stress to get great grades to get into a good college. Turns out all that ridicule by teachers was all a time waste because I proved them wrong and got really great grades. Got into a good college but my troubles didn't end there. Like I said, due to so many negativity at home and in school and so much pressure I got depressed and I burnt out as well. Then I found a  girl(not my gf right now). She was all over me. Like, she told me she has a crush on me but I was depressed so I just didn't give a fuck. We are good friends at the moment and she has bailed me out on many occasions. She has helped me out in every assignment, research paper and  just about everything. I will always be grateful that she showed so much affection towards me otherwise I'd have dropped out due to bad  grades. I have managed to pass all my classes despite being so  mentally fatigued and she had a big role to play in that.  What I am trying to say is,  when I finally gave up on everything, thought it's all over for me and that I merely want to exist now, I found someone who reminded me that I am not a bad person after all. That I deserve affection and attention.  I am hoping something happens out of nowhere and I can feel the pure happiness once again leaving my past behind.  It's really nice to hope buddy. It gives us strength to face the challenges of today.   I just want to conclude that you might find someone or a life changing event might happen and all your worries might go away. Just keep hoping and make the effort for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have noticed  psychology professors are usually the most stupid. It's kinda ironical. They have studied the human mind and they learn and talk about things like unconditional positive regard, empathy  etc and yet they are  the least helpful among the professors.  
I have  got few stupid psychology professors as well and I hate them so much. I love the subject but those professors have sucked the joy out of this subject. This is why I am learning graphic and web designing as well and honestly web designing seems to be more interesting now  due to these pathetic professors. Also, it's more of a straight forward and to the point subject while psychology is highly opinion-oriented.  I don't know, that kind of a professor is very harmful to the students. I would be tempted to drop the class.
However, don't think about dropping yet. Just prepare the things they'll ask  in the exam and give your best. Then see  where you want to go from there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You shouldn't say that. I fucked even more badly than the OP during my first year but I cleared all my exams and even got a B in Stats exam and my teachers thought I'd fail everything. I am probably the biggest procrastinator this world has seen and will ever see and yet I am here in my second year. My third semester will be completed within 2 more months and then I'll be even closer to graduate. I have improved but I still procrastinate here and there but I will stick it out. College is not supposed to be a cake walk. It is hard and we will  face harder challenges in our working life but that doesn't mean we have to give up. If ranting helps then do it time to time and try harder. That's it. Main aim is to get the damn degree with at least an average-above average grades/GPA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man! I totally feel you. I have become an anxious wreck today thinking about all the paper work I have to do.  I am majoring in Applied Psychology(not in USA) and there are so many papers to write  in this course.  I have to write 20-30 pages each for 6-7 practicals and I hate hand written work. Anyway, we have computers and laptops in the real world so why do we still have to write stuff down? We can just type it out.  This is something I never understand about colleges. Like, it was okay to do this in school but in real world, we'll always have access to information and a computer to type all of it so why the hell do we have to write 180-200 pages every semester?  I am also getting a certificate in graphic and web designing and I plan to learn 3D animation and VFX as well. To be honest, psychology seems to be full of women and it's just hard to cooperate with so many women. Teachers are huge feminists. I do not have problem with them but reminding us every second how women are always oppressed is just annoying.  The only good thing is that education in my country is very cheap so I won't go into debt and I can take more than 1  UG degree without any troubles. Also, I can easily afford to get certificates in Graphic and web design and also in a subject like Accountancy.  I can be very flexible with job prospects like that and I won't go into debt.  That is really a relief knowing that I can get my BA  in Applied Psychology by the age of 21 and then I'll still have time to see if I want to do something else. Meanwhile, I can look for  jobs, save up money and see where I want to go from there.  I wanted to drop out during my  first year but now I am thinking I should stick it out, get a BA and see what happens. A big reason why I don't want to drop out is that I don't know what else I'd be doing if I drop it now especially after clearing first year and only having 2 more years to see off. This is the only thing that keeps me going. I am too lazy to work right now so the best bet is to graduate and then see where I end up at. I repeat, being in no debt whatsoever will be liberating and  will give me a chance to be flexible with my work life.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that I am enjoying Web design a whole lot more than Psychology because it is more technical and practical than Psychology. Psychology is way too theoretical and there is too much useless handwritten work. </TEXT>

Also it is amazing that sometimes we get worked up about things like a simple class test while there are so many things happening around in the world. I mean, a single human being doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Forget about one human being, it is highly possible we as a species don't matter either. Blows my mind.

<TITLE> Wasted one year at college? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-17 19:38:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like I have wasted one year of college already. I had a terrible depression and severe anxiety during my first year of college. Once I  got  there I have no trouble in talking to my peers and I think they generally liked me because whenever I wouldn't come they'd always ask why I am not coming and when I'm going to be back. 
  The trouble is it wasn't that I did not want to go but whenever I had to go, I'd be severely anxious in the morning and because of that I used to skip classes. However, whenever I went there, I had no trouble in talking to them.  The thing is I skipped a lot of days during my first year and my teachers got angry because of that. I missed out on opportunities and making a new friend circle. I had bad grades(albeit it could have been worse so that's not the main problem).   
  Mainly, I am feeling bad because I think I missed out on a lot of things due to my anxiety. I have two more years to get  my BA and the  fact that this time will not come back kind of feels like a stab with a knife. I haven't got a girlfriend. I just don't  care about anything much now a days but I still feel bad.
Also, my anxiety still hasn't gone away completely so I still skip classes here and there. 
Just want to have some advice and if you could share your college life then that'd  be great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a college student right now and I usually put no effort in useless things.  Don't get me wrong, I put effort when I have exams but in this instance, our teachers tell us to write a rough draft for practical file and then write them in fair.
  I'd love to type it out and email them but they want it hand  written. I put no effort in that and just wait for few students to submit their rough drafts and then like me, most of the class just copies their stuff. Why are some teachers so narrow minded? I'd like to know, do you bother to put great effort in your work/study everyday? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice to  see that you're planning to tough it out this semester. Believe me, I am in my third semester and I still sometimes think about just ending it all.But then again, what will I do even if I quit? I knew the best time to do college was now because a gap year can either make it or break it. I also decided to stick it out and so far I am doing okay.
I have September to go then I will have a lot of off days for October. I have to go till Nov 11 and then I'll have preparatory leave. My theory exams will commence from 24  Nov. So, it's only few days for me to attend college then I will have some time off and another semester under my belt. 
Then I'll have 3 more semesters to get my BA.
I think I made the right choice  of staying. Dropping out would have meant starting all over so it's something that you always need to really think about.
I am happy you're going to see off this semester but make sure after this semester, even if you do drop out, think about it deeply and never ever sit at home doing nothing. Getting out of the house and meeting people will be important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you "The Skipper"? I skip a lot although my grades aren't too bad and I'll surely end up getting an average-above average SGPA. I am planning to be a lot more present in class in my semester 4 now. Semester 1 was okay for me. Semester 2 was a disaster.  Semester 3 has been relatively better. I still skip classes though. Old habits die  hard. Even if I just become punctual, I am sure I'll end up with 60-70% or maybe even 80-90% so skipping has been the biggest issue for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am the same but the question is even if you go home or dropout then what else will you do anyway? The best time is now. I have seen people saying they are not ready for college and then they just get lazy and spend days inside  their room. 
Those people who do not want to attend college must have a job or be involved in some kind of physical activity. Socializing becomes important as well. 
It's very easy to get lazy when you finish high  school. That is  something we'll have to learn. Self discipline is the key. Easier said than done.
Anyway, just want to  let you know I can relate but sticking it out is   the best option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stupid parents.
I  hate it when people procreate even knowing fully well that they are not financially stable or have way too many bad habits or they're too irresponsible to have kids.
People just say it's a basic human right but it's stupid. If you can't afford to have kids then don't have them.
I will never have kids until I am ready to provide them a decent life.
My father is the most irresponsible person I have ever seen and I am a lot like him in this regard.  
I will make sure I am qualified to become a father rather than conforming to society's standard of living.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It happened in 2014 or 2015.
I was at my cousin's house and me, my brother and my cousin sister were standing in the balcony enjoying the wonderful night. 
Suddenly, I saw three huge red dots gliding slowly in the sky. They were  really large and we knew it was not an  airplane or an aircraft that we'd ever seen. It was really bizarre.
It was shining very brightly but I didn't have a smartphone during that time so I couldn't take any pics. 
I was taken  aback and kept wondering what it might be. Then it all disappeared and till this date, we don't know what it actually was. 
It happened in Asia.
Also, I would like to add those three large dots seemed very near yet they felt quite far away. Like I said, it was bizarre.

<TEXT> Are you an introvert? I am a lot like you bud.I have acquaintances but no close friends in college because I  commute 1.5 hours daily to get to college. I don't mind not having lots of friends. I am still in touch with high school friends and I have got few cousins with whom I enjoy. So, I have never really tried to make a lot of friends in college. I have some people with whom I talk to once I get there. I have no trouble if I have to talk because we can talk about studies, classes,movies and random bullshit. 
You have to realize most people are morons anyway. A lot of them are selfish. As you grow older, people would want to be friends with you for their own profit. 
That is why I am still in contact with high school friends because they're trustworthy and I take a lot of time before putting faith in a person. 
If you really want friends then you can try out meetups. Talk more to the acquaintances. Join clubs etc. 
It's really up to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see you're really sad. You're depressed. Sometimes I feel like I am depressed too but not diagnosed. I don't know how did I spend my last 5 years. I am 19 right now and ever since I turned 13-14 I lost track and got lost. For the last 5-6 years, I have been running away from life. Constantly hating myself for little things. No self believe. Hating my guts. Hating my personality and believing there is something fundamentally wrong with me.
I hate the fact I have skipped 3 days in a row of college. I went there on Monday. I felt good. People loved to see me. I  didn't come across as someone having anxiety or depression. Maybe I don't have it really.
But then I didn't go on Tuesday, Wednesday and today.
I overslept and hating myself ever since I woke up today.
But I will go tomorrow. I will go the next week and will try to make things better for myself everyday. 
I won't give up. I am still young. I have a lot of life ahead of me. I have people who love me. 
So do you OP. 
Hang in there.
You can do it. Find a part time job or get a certificate in something to get a job. Hit the gym. See your old friends. Talk to someone. People love you OP. They really do. No one hates you. 
You are depressed but keep trudging. You'll slowly get there.
One more thing, everyone has to die so why not give it a shot and see where life takes you? Why end it all? It is not good today but it might be great tomorrow. Then you'll wonder why did you even think about ending it all. 
Get a job, decide what you want out of life, go and get a  degree later once you know what you want to do, save up money and know that many people are in the same boat so talk to people. Let them know you are there. Let someone know you'll be there when the going gets tough. Someone needs you OP. Somewhere, someone out there wants you and want you to be happy and help them in their life too. Don't give up. Stay there, go to the park, go to the gym and hope.
Hope keeps us all alive. Hope for a better tomorrow. </TEXT>

Be a man and don't give in to any emotional bullshit.
You'll meet many MANY attractive women in your life so better find someone better than the current one.
It all sounds harsh and mean but I am being blunt about it. I met a super attractive girl in high school and thought she was amazing and my "soul mate"  LMAO! That was  utter bullshit.
She was nothing. She had a terrible attitude and was too proud of herself. I have seen many attractive women since then and it's easy to get a crush on someone new.

<TEXT> I understand some people have ambitions but my college peers(usually girls) freak out way too much and spoil my good mood with their mood swings. I have been trying hard to convince them that they should just relax and take it all easy. They worry about grades too much whereas I know that it ultimately depends on what and who you know later on in life so stop being so damn worried all the time. 
I usually end up getting worried and anxious whenever I talk to   them.
How do I convince them that it's okay to enjoy life and  not be so damn serious about academics  all the time?
I am a male by the way.
EDIT:Fuck off butthurts. You'll are muppets. I have been a topper in high school and still doing above average in college but I am not an idiot to believe that filling out paper work and freaking about it all the time is the way to live your life. People like me for being someone who doesn't follow the crowd. You'll are assuming that they're working hard on something relevant while in reality they're just freaking about damn paper work all the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is really scary. I blew my second semester off but somehow I have passed everything and I am officially in my second year now. 3rd semester has been relatively easier and I feel in a better state of mind than the previous two semesters. Coming from a lot of violence as a child, it was like I was in a dream-like state during my first year. It all felt so surreal. I felt as if I have come to a new planet because it all seemed so new. It was like I had entered a different world. 
As time passed, I felt more at ease and now I feel a lot better and I feel like I have been kicked back into reality. 
I just feel I wasn't ready for college and should have taken a year off but then again I had been so restricted as a child to go out that I had a fear of everything. I even felt uncomfortable if I had to take a bus or metro. I resented public transport so maybe I would have locked myself indoors doing nothing and probably would have been just wasting my time.
Guess, I made the right decision to keep going through even though this stuff scared the hell out of me and I had to face  some tough and  humiliating moments. But, still, here I am, passed and promoted to second year with a better state of mind right now. 
What I mean to say by that story is that you'll get scared, you'll get anxious and you'd want to take the easy route but if you do stick it out till the end, you might do something you never imagined you'd do. You might surprise yourself and some unexpected things might happen.
If you have  severe anxiety then you'll need professional help. Words won't get that out of your system but if you can control yourself while having anxiety then I'd suggest you to bite the bullet and go through this phase. You'll thank yourself for sticking it out in the future because once you get that damn degree, it'll be so worth it. </TEXT>

My teacher once told us,especially about me, that this kid right here is not supremely intelligent but he's wise and his good nature attitude has the potential to take him far.(Although now I struggle with self esteem, I do think I have a lot of potential that I haven't realized yet). Feels nice to get a reminder that there's always hope even if you're in doubt. Cheers mate! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really know what to suggest but remind her that she is in college mainly for her education. Everything else doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things so education must be her top priority.
I understand that you need to have fun as well so maybe she can try and look for activities outside college? It's not necessary that your life should revolve around college only. You can see if there are things happening around which you can enjoy or find a job on campus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went for jogging with a friend today. I was quite glad to see him after such a long time but something weird happened. The dude kept talking about himself. He kept talking about how he knows so much about exercising. He has been going to gym on and off from last one year. He is fit but doesn't really have a mind boggling physique. Yet he kept talking about eating right, doing this and that exercise etc. He  even started giving me a lecture about what career should I plan and what I should be doing with my life. Initially, I just thought nothing of it and treated it like a conversation starter but the lad kept giving his lecture about everything in the world all the time we were in park.
The biggest thing that annoyed me was that he was telling me what I am doing wrong with my life and what I should be doing instead. 
Man! It didn't annoy me so much while we were exercising but now since I have been back to home it's really making me mad. </TEXT>
