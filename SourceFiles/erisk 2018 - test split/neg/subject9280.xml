I'm running extremely low on money and wasn't able to order some and now I just ran out.  Any kratom would mean so much to me as I have been rationing it the last couple days and feel suicidal anhedonia creeping back in.  I wish I had the money so I didn't have to post asking strangers for some but here I am and I'm so angry at myself </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm gonna get down voted but I just don't want to see you even more hurt mate. If a girl or anyone takes away your pain this much, when the relationship ends the gaping whole in your chest becomes even bigger. 

I'm not saying don't date her, but recognize that she can't become the source of your happiness, because if she does then when that source is taken away you will be devastated.  It's fine to date her, but realize you can't base your sense of self on having her, because then without her you will feel like no one.

It's painful to understand this, but it's *EXTREMELY* painful when you think that she can fill your emptiness and then after the relationship ends you go right back to where you started.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How much relief did you get? I've already tried so many things and I need real relief too or my life will fall apart to a point that's way beyond the hell I already live in.

I'm almost 24, and over a decade have tried 12 antidepressants, 8 stimulants, TMS therapy, ketamine infusions, various nootropics, mediation, lifestyle changes such as profound mediation and exercise, new friendships and girlfriends, and nothing ever takes away my anhedonia.

Whenever my outlook is better all that remains is still utter lack of emotions; can't feel pleasure or joy in anything, and this always eventually leads back to dark thoughts.  It's like living in a world of just the color white, and nothing else exists and you're there for years.

I'm currently on TRT which I started two months ago for low testosterone and it helped a lot but then I stopped feeling better a couple weeks ago and don't know why. I suspect it's because I stopped my minor kratom habit of a couple months, but I haven't felt good or been able to function in over a month. Before that I hadn't been able to function ever really. 

I'm about to try this compound BPC-157 and a bunch of other things but I'm losing hope quick </TEXT>

People miss simpler times without the non-stop technology, social media, and news, and want to go back to when things were quieter and simpler, and so will do anything to feel like they did before, and these studios recognize that there's a huge market to cash in on.  

That's why the new Star Wars was such a fucking re-do of the first, because everyone was jerking off with nostalgia and the studio wants more and more $$ </TEXT>

<TITLE> I find Star Wars boring and the unending circlejerk tiresome and annoying </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-05 03:06:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Other people can like what they like, just as I like what I like, that's completely okay. I'm not a Star Wars fan and find the movies extremely overrated; some really like it, that's fine.  

The thing that annoys me is hearing about it all the time and its fans constantly circlejerking the Star Wars culture.  *"DAE Darth Vader themed ____!?"*

I'm really into music and am a huge Metallica, G'N'R, and 2Pac fan, and am really into things like psychedelics, comedy, fitness, sports, and movies, but I don't dress up my dog like Slash or have bumper stickers on my car about my favorite films like GoodFellas or Shawkshank Redemption.  I don't go to the supermarket and see Game of Thrones themed Macaroni and goddamn cheese.

I know this is likely coming off as someone who's bitter about something, like much of the posts on this sub can sometimes come off as, but its really just that repeatedly hearing *"DERR May the 4th be with you!"* can get irritating, especially as it relates to a series that I find so numbingly over-saturated into the culture already.

It honestly always feels to me as if the culture is pushing that everyone must like Star Wars and hear about all the goddamn time.  Side note, Ricky And Morty is slowly infecting the culture like this too.  The show is alright, but not laugh out loud funny at all, and the "deep" nihilism commentary isn't anything truly revolutionary either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks a lot for the answer man.  Did you buy from Peptides Warehouse? I bought from there and they're apparently not responding to anyone's orders or emails right now.

I'm really suffering and need relief desperately and I think I should try Uridine like you're saying.  Did you start off with just that or did you start off with the happy stack? 

Also are there any side effects and could you tell me where you buy your's? Thanks a ton again man this help really could save my life </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always loved the into riff to AJFA. Maybe I'm blanking on something but it always reminds me of some sort of anthem and it just SOUNDS like it fits in with the word Justice.

Do you mean almost like an anthem or a pledge like a pledge of allegiance? I'm curious what you mean exactly this is an interesting observation as I have no idea what the intro is supposed to be sounding like. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I feel AJFA is Metallica's best song ever, even better than MOP </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-04 02:58:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> IMO it just has everything I'd ever want in a Metallica song, I can't describe it, but aside from a ballad like *One*, just as a purely 100% metal track, it stands out to me as Metallica's best song, and its definitely my favorite Metallica song and the peak of their skills. 

The rhythm is no doubt their best ever, the vocals are James' best (probably equal with *One*), the lyrics are fucking intense and cold as shit, the solo is retardedly good, and the drumming is at Lars' peak, especially with the double bass.

When I hear this song to me it just sounds like Metallica's heaviest fucking song ever.  It's heaviness is on par with *One*, but AJFA is heavier in a much different way.  *One* is more about a hopeless, desperate situation, and the heaviness in that song gives off the feeling of existing in the ultimate hell where there is no escape.  AJFA gives off a heaviness that is more about extreme anger about how fucked up the so called "justice" system is and about how fucked we all are because of it.

Just my two cents, would love to hear your opinions. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Taking BPC-157 Orally </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-01 20:13:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I asked some basic questions about this peptide couple days ago and then proceeded to do a lot more research through the nootropics sub and various places on the web and through guides such as Ben Greenfield's [here](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2016/05/how-to-use-bpc-157/).

My plan is to purchase the BPC from Peptides Warehouse and then reconstitute it and use it orally.  I'm very much on a budget and already have an extra clean insulin needle and syringe from the stuff I use to inject testosterone weekly for hypogonadism.

I was wondering if it's okay to use the same needle and syringe when reconstituting and when drawing from the peptide later to spray into my mouth for oral use.  I know its possibly not optimal in terms of contaminating the peptide, but if I plan to use BPC-157 for just around two weeks and will never be injecting (so obviously I don't risk injection whatsoever), just wondering if its safe for me and will also not harm the peptide if I use the same needle and syringe for spraying over two weeks.

Also if I use distilled water for reconstituting and keep the peptide in the fridge is that okay? Or is bacteriostatic water a must for not harming the peptide's potency?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey I'm almost 24 and have the exact issues you went through with anhedonia and things.  I took adderall at a young age for years by prescription for ADD and I believe it definitely played a role in messing up my dopaminergic system, thus leaving me with a higher tendency toward severe daily anhedonia.

First I was wondering if since the time you took them do you still feel the improvements from the BPC-157 and the uridine?

I have no problem with needles and deal with them weekly for hypogandism but I would rather take this sublingually as you did and was wondering if you could tell me the way you did it.

Also have you noticed any negative effects over time from the peptide?

Thank you so much for your help, if you can help me out it means a ton coming from a guy here, who like you, has been trying everything for a very long time to heal his brain/body and thus his mind </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I would like to take it for its possible benefits in healing the dopaminergic system after years of stimulant use.  I was prescribed ADD medicines for years as a child and adolescent and suspect its part of the reason that I've suffered from severe anhedonia for the last many years.

I'm not afraid of needles and actually self-inject testosterone cypionate once a week under the treatment of a doctor for my hypogonadism, however I'd rather not inject this.  

Can you guys tell me if theres another way to take this substance such as sublingually or orally? I also really don't know how this needs to be mixed or where to purchase it, any help is greatly appreciated    </TEXT>

Almost everyone has it but doesn't realize.  However, some people like you and I and many others have it to a very powerful and scary degree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get [this](http://simplereminders.com/domains/simplereminders.com/uploads/authors/eckhart-tolle.jpg) right on your wrist and you'll always remember to dwell in the now and not identify with your ego.

In all seriousness I believe getting a tattoo can either be done with attachment to something or really just for the sake of adding something to your already fulfilled wholeness.  I wouldn't recommend you getting a tattoo related to meditation or anything for that matter if it will be done to fulfill a subconscious *need* to feel whole that your ego believes a tattoo will give you.

However if you recognize that this tattoo will just be a cool addition to your life I say go ahead and get it!

My recommendation would be a small quote from the book, anything relating to remembering that you are one with the universe (and everyone and everything) and that your egoic reality is just a phantom of your thoughts and not the truthful objective reality.

<TEXT> I'm so sorry you're going through this. As someone who is depressed and suicidal daily I can say the pain you're feeling in your chest is almost 100% the same feeling your friend had while he was alive. 

It's not talked about because it makes us look weak but people who kill themselves often suffer from this type of pain daily for years upon years with no treatment working. I'm sorry he's gone, I'm also glad he's finally at peace and is no longer suffering.

Maybe a treatment could have eventually taken away his pain, but either way it's okay because he's at peace now and no longer struggling.

I'm sorry man, this life can be so tough and the society we live in can make it 1000x harder. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Withdrawal making me very suicidal </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-24 19:40:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have extremely severe depression and anxiety and anhedonia and I started my withdrawal a week ago and then took about 1-2 grams on this past Saturday night so I relapsed. I only took for five-six months or so but took daily towards the end.

The withdrawal has made it impossible for me to enjoy a single bite of food, piece of music, conversation, or moment of existence. Every moment is currently extreme suffering. 

The worst part about it is with nothing to enjoy at all I can only focus on bad things and so my suicidal depression is here at the moment and I feel like there's no reason to live my life. I'm almost 24 and am three years behind in college and stuck at home and I've made so many mistakes in my life and am focused on my exes and all my lost friendships l. I don't know what I expected writing this but I really could use support right now because I feel like it's not gonna be okay and I'm not gonna make it to a better time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After 3 weeks on TRT for my hypogandism I felt the best I felt in years and a good portion of my depression and anxiety began to fade and I had so much energy and a calm demeanor. 

Around a week ago at the end of my fifth week I began to feel not great and since then its been a week and I've felt terrible all week.

I just don't know for sure if I'm crashing now because my natural production has completely shutdown or something else TRT related and hoped I could get some input from you guys because I'm really not doing okay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why man? I'm not being rude or an asshole whatsoever.  It may be a 
seemingly stupid question for people that know a ton on this sub, but I just wanted to make sure what I'm doing isn't getting my body accustomed to something harder than kratom.

I just wanted some help thats all </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks a lot for the message man, like seriously messages like this from kind people like you mean the world to me.

I have phenibut actually but I won't touch it because it usually makes me much more depressed the day after.

I think I'm going to try to take a warm bath in epsom salts in just a bit and see if that helps.

I honestly don't know to what to use for my anhedonia now that I'm done with krarom but I guess I'll just have to keep looking, because kratom for me was never a long term solution </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just started withdrawal 2 days ago, some questions and need some help </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-19 00:45:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys I had been using kratom on and off several times a week since December and in the last month and a half had been using it almost every day of the week, and the last two weeks used it sometimes twice daily.

I had used it for my severe anhedonia and anxiety and it helps when I take it, but it only lasts so short (1 - 3 hours) each time I toss and swish so its not a long-term solution.

Some background: In the past I've tried 12 antidepressants, 8 stimulants, years of talk therapy, mediation, ketamine infusions, TMS therapy, lifestyle changes, diet and exercise, and I suspect along with my doctor that my brain has a dopamine dysfunction that does not have many real options for treatment as we don't know the exact issue with the dopamine. Stimulants help the most but my body has a crazy amount of nasty side effects from them and always a huge crash.  Recently I also got diagnosed for very low testosterone at the age of almost 24, and have been on testosterone replacement therapy now for 5 weeks and have felt better recently from that, but it doesn't touch my anhedonia one bit.

Anyway, I had my last bit of kratom almost 48 hours ago and I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms like really increased anhedonia and anxiety and am having a hard time coping.

Was just wondering if you guys could tell me if this heavy increase in depression/anxiety is normal for kratom withdrawal, and how long you suspect this increased depression/anxiety to last for me?  Would love to hear some stories of your experiences with kratom withdrawal too as I really do feel so alone right now.

Also was wondering if you guys had any suggestions regarding what I should try next for treatment for my severe anhedonia as for the last several months kratom was what I relied on to be able to enjoy things and hang out with people and have conversations and just experience joy in things.

Thanks for your help guys

<TITLE> How long should I take probiotics and digestive enzymes? And which first? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-17 01:36:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I took accutane about 4 years ago and it worked wonders for my acne but left me with bad stomach issues and I can no longer eat spicy foods or much dairy without landing in the bathroom for hours.

I have since had blood and stool tests along with a colonoscopy and endoscopy to help determine the exact cause of my stomach issues and the only thing that my GI saw was extreme sensitivity and he believes the accutane destroyed much of the good bacteria in my gut.

So I want to take probiotics and digestive enzymes to help repair my gut and stomach issues along with healing any other possible damage.

Do I take probiotcs and digestive enzymes at the same time? Or should I take one before the other? And either way how long do I take each of them? Is it indefinitely or like short courses of them like for a few months every couple years?

Thanks for your help guys </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just keep thinking man how fucked up my own mental health issues are, and how fucked up I think and sad I feel on a literal daily basis, and how if therapists I went to and friends I saw reinforced my ideas by telling me they were true how I would be completely lost and a literal goner.  

I sometimes think things like I'll never get out of my depression and that no one wants to talk to me, and if I had people that reinforced those ideas by telling me they were true then I would surely go insane and soon kill myself.  

Thankfully they aren't true and thankfully I have people to remind me that my irrational beliefs are wrong.  But I can't fathom how if a dude is sick enough to think he needs tits and a vagina that he won't get the same support I would get, and that the people he would trust the MOST to help him are helping sick people become more mentally unstable and permanently disfigured all for the sake of being politically correct and staying on the "right side" of history.

It actually pains me to my core how bad mental health professionals are failing at helping these obviously mentally ill individuals, and I think its insane how the mainstream media is labeling people like [Dr. Paul McHugh](http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/johns-hopkins-psychiatrist-transgender-mental-disorder-sex-change) as evil hateful bigots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe its just me being a dick, but I find lots of cartoon shows geared towards adults to best fit in with humor for middle schoolers.  Most people I know that watch Rick and Morty have a lower threshold for humor and think family guy and the simpsons are also hilarious.  

Once you hit around 22 you realize there's a ton more shows out there with better written humor and plotlines then a bunch of crappy cartoons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might be an unpopular opinion, but I found the dude getting dragged to be overreacting SIGNIFICANTLY by screaming like he was getting raped.

At the point when they said they were taking him off what did he think physically resisting was going to do? work? help his butt stay stuck to the seat? I'm not saying it was morally appropriate for the airline to do that, but he knew they were about to take him off by force and that resisting would just make it worse and not work at all.  

IMO, hearing him scream as if his child just died or he was getting raped was an insane overreaction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have severe depression and anxiety and have been pushing and working hard my whole life to not let it rule my life, and perhaps always will be struggling to keep going.

But I acknowledge how flawed and irrational many of my beliefs and fears are during much of my daily life, and I'm thankful that I have people to remind me how delusional I can be thinking, as to show me there's more to reality than what I currently see.

I think it's so fucked up how many therapists and psychiatrists are telling mentally ill people who want to cut off their dicks or breasts that they are fine and that what they are doing and thinking is healthy. I think it's insanely disgusting how mainstream culture is telling these sick unhealthy people that they are right in their beliefs and that they should in fact take hormones and destroy and mutilate their bodies. 

The fact is one cannot *feel* like a man or a woman. Being a man or a woman isn't defined by the clothes you wear or how long your hair is. Feeling like a man or a woman means feeling a penis or vagina between your thighs and feeling the XY or XX chromosomes in your body; and it is impossible to have the feeling of the opposite of either in ones body. It is impossible for me to know that I need XX chromosomes or a vagina on my body, because I have no way of understanding what that even means. The whole thing is just mental illness that should be and NEEDS to be treated as such. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know a lot of people might not like my answer, but Kratom is a great alternative for latent pain.  It is a plant thats ground up into tea powder and is amazing at crushing depression and anxiety for 1-5 hours each time depending on dose.

It's completely safe and legal but like any other substance if you take it too often you will develop a tolerance, and like alcohol or weed you will experience withdrawal after stopping long term use.  

However I can tell you kratom and r/kratom have not figuratively, but literally saved my life.  On my most suicidal nights I take some and it can completely shift my paradigm and mood within 30 minutes. </TEXT>

I hate Donald Trump and can see like any other rational human that he's a patholoical lying narccasist, but this is so obvious that I don't think hearing the same comedian say it ever night is so funny anymore.

Moreover, Meyers' voice is so fucking irritating, but well that's really besides the point I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude I feel you **100%**.

I'm almost 24 and have been depressed essentially my whole life, and significantly since I was 10.

I've tried 12 different antidepressants long term, I've tried 8 different ADD meds, I've tried ketamine infusions, TMS therapy, countless supplements, diet, exercise, meditation, and a million lifestyle changes.  Some of these changed my outlook and mindset significantly in positive ways, but have never consistently taken away my anhedonia and pain.

I've tried being in long term relationships, hanging with friends, and nothing ever helps.

Thank the lord though, I read several months back about how low testosterone can cause similar issues to depression, and I got checked and my levels came back super low on two separate occasions, and so I got on weekly injections four weeks ago, and since then I feel the best i've felt in ages.  I have more energy, confidence, less fatigue, less anxiety, slightly less depression, and a bit better sex drive so far, and it's still very early in my treatment, so it should improve even more.  

I still have severe anhedonia and may have to keep looking for an option to treat that, but please if you haven't get your testosterone levels checked and research yourself what low levels actually are, because the doctor will tell you you're fine even if your levels are very low.

Keep looking for a treatment man, there's fucking so many out there, it sucks feeling like shit all the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most people do not have the money to buy the same game three times.  Gaming subreddits can definitely create bubbles of hardcore gamers who forget that the majority of gamers do not match up with their lifestyle.  Most people spend probably 3% of their money or less on gaming, while hardcore gamers can spend 15-20% or even more.  

Spending $180 on the same game is not the lifestyle of a casual gamer, and this game is already half a decade old.  

It might sell well, it might not, but its hard to see casual gamers who have bought this game once on any myriad of systems buying this game again at a $60 price point, when they can pick it up for $10-$20 on any other platform. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They administered the standard dose for one infusion, and a slightly raised dose for the last five infusions.

It was completely and utterly life-changing, the most profound experiences I've ever had.  I had been doing a ton of meditation, spiritual book reading, and mind work for months and months before and so the ketamine just propelled me to a new level.

However, for me it didn't solve my depression, as I'm sure the cause is something unrelated to the ketamine's method of action.  Still, although I don't like the price, it was the most insightful experiences of my entire life that have since further sparked powerful changes in my conscious experience of life. </TEXT>

Joe is the farthest thing from any stereotype, he doesn't fit in any one category and you understand from watching him that he is a genuinely good dude.

But I understand how a judgmental, shallow person can come to their own conclusions before gathering enough evidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's bad, but do-able tbh. I'm paying $515 total for 5 months. It sucks but I get to do at home injections and with my symptoms and severity of them im willing to do anything to get better. 

I also tried ketamine infusions and they cost me $2300 for two weeks.

Most clinics will likely be more expensive then mine but its better than going to a specialist who forces you to come in for injections and will only let you do them every two weeks or every month.  Clinics offer more freedom in TRT but can be a bit pricer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try to find an anti-aging clinic in the area that isnt too expensive. You're T is low and no matter how much sleep you get, healthy you eat, and workout, you won't feel great I can guarantee it.

Don't waste another few months waiting, keep trying every clinic until one is priced well and will treat you.  My total T came back 288, and 417, and my free T came back 7.9 in the labcorp ranges.  My endo said I was fine, even though I'm only almost 24 and have EVERY symptom of low T.  So I went to an anti-aging clinic that's not too expensive and I've been on injections for several weeks now and already have more energy, less anxiety, and less fatigue, and slightly improved mood.  So far it's the best and most confident I've felt in years and its still only been 3 weeks! 

You're happiness is the only thing that matters.  You need to feel healthy and good to get there. Please don't wait and don't give up

But definitely you need more labs before going on TRT </TEXT>

<TITLE> Primary or Secondary/Tertiary Hypogonadism? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-29 06:03:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Currently 23, been on weekly TRT cypionate injections for just two weeks, just had third injection Monday.  Here's the two sets of bloodwork I did at LabCorp before starting TRT:

**First blood tests (3 months ago):**

* Total Testosterone: 288 ng/dl
* Free Testosterone: not measured in this one
* TSH 1.960 uIU/mL  (0.450 - 4.500 uIU/mL)
* Prolactin	8.2 ng/mL	(4.0 - 15.2 ng/mL)

**Second blood tests (1 month ago):**

* Total Testosterone: 417 ng/dl
* Free Testosterone: 7.9 (I forget the unit type..)
* LH	7.9 mIU/mL (1.7 - 8.6 mIU/mL)
* FSH 1.9 mIU/mL (1.5 - 12.4 mIU/mL)

Are my LH and FSH normal and therefore indicate primary hypogonadism? Or is my LH too high and my FSH too low and therefore indicate something else? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My depression is like a never-ending flu. Going 13 years strong now, at almost 24 I'm truly close to almost giving up after having failed 12 antidepressants, 8 stimulants, years of talk therapy, ketamine infusions, TMS therapy, CBT, meditation, exercise and diet, supplements, and nootropics. 

I have a good outlook on what can change, and my perspective on life is rock solidly peaceful, but every day I feel like hell on the inside, like utter shit physically and emotionally. 

I just found out two months ago my testosterone is really low and I started weekly TRT injections last week and I'm hoping on my life's sake it will work. 

I don't know what I'll do if it doesn't help. It's not possible to live life in any functional sense with severe flu symptoms every day. The only thing that could get a person through is knowing the flu would soon go away. What happens when I've tried everything and my flu won't go away? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most dudes loves slutty, stupid chicks, they're easier to fuck and they dress showing their tits and ass in a way that makes you want to fuck them more then if they were covered up. 

Thing is though, no one who respects themselves wants to date these types of girls because who wants to be friends with a fake person with no self-respect or let alone have them be the mother of their kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tbh, this might be an unpopular opinion, but I find a lot of women around my age, 20-24, have a fakeness so deeply ingrained in them that around 80% or more of them speak with that fake valley-girl inflection.

Humans, like dogs, can sense disingenuineness, deceit, and a lack of authenticity in a subconscious way and so its so easy to see how fake and carbon-copy these types of girls are.  They're the worst kind to be around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> IMO I'd like to see RG3 leave the NFL. I was a big fan of his pretty stellar execution of trick plays and liked seeing another QB who could scramble and use the read-option and not just be a straight up pocket passer, but after that first season every year he's just been a huge disappointment and a waste of money to whatever team he signed with. 

Not sure if his downfall seems even worse because of how rich and hyped he became even before taking his first ever NFL snap, but he's not worth the money and I think he'll never top his rookie season.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Will stopping fapping and watching porn increase my sex drive? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-16 05:59:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The only reason I fap in the first place anymore is because I'm currently going through shit and am not in the state to meet people, let alone girls at the moment, and while I'm in the process of rebuilding myself and my life completely, I can't stand the feeling of shittyness that overwhelms me when I feel horny, it makes me super fucking depressed because it reminds me of the time when I had one of my exes to fuck or other girls of the past.  So I fap and the feelings go away and I once again feel clear and at peace, for long after each fap.  These faps dont give me any bad feelings ever either.  

But im curious, if I stop fapping do you think these sexual urges will slow down and stop attacking me? That's all I really want, and like I said the only reason I fap to begin with, to return to a non-anxious non-depressed state that lasts for hours after each time I do it.

I'm not addicted in any way, and can stop anytime and have before. The only reason I do it again is because that shitty depressed feeling of missing a girl or my exes or missing sex goes away each time and I once again feel light and like a feather, and so clear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks man you're gonna make me cry man. It just hurts fucking to the core of your soul to know more than half your life has been experienced in pain. I wish I was tougher, because the past 13 years have only really consisted of hundreds upon hundreds of lost friends, several failed attempts at trying to go to college, and days upon days of doing nothing but dying slowly inside my room. At this point it might not be too late to make friends and finish college, but that's only if I can be healthy. 

I've tried doing all these things while living severely depressed and anxious and with terrible ADD and over 13 years I was never tough enough or strong enough to keep up the fight against my mental
health, and so my life fell apart. And now I'm almost 24 and still don't have an answer to get healthy, and truly now I believe it's likely too late to make good friends or finish college </TEXT>

<TITLE> Taking Kratom while on T-Cypionate Injections? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-15 13:58:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm 23 almost 24, just started weekly Testosterone-Cypionate injections two days ago after finding out I had low T months back. 

I suffer from pretty much almost every symptom of low T, the most difficult being depression and anxiety and I take kratom during really bad times to help me get through. 

I was wondering if anyone here takes or has taken kratom while also on TRT and if it will interfere or not with the TRT doing its job. I've heard before that kratom lowers testosterone but I wasn't sure if that was true or not, so I'm just curious about what people here know regarding these two interacting. Thanks guys, I want the best for all of you ! </TEXT>

However, I would tell anyone that can sell anything to try it its worth it if this many people are entering remission after each infusion, just make sure you can afford monthly maintenance infusions.

I hope all those suffering from severe treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, ADD, etc. like myself can get help and get better.

We all deserve a second chance, a true hope at redemption and an opportunity to experience life from an existence of peace and love, and not extreme constant fear.  I love you all reddit ! </TEXT>

<TEXT> How would the guy with economically viable clothes have paid as much or more than the people who are wearing more expensive clothes? Are you saying that in reference to a claim that the majority of console players pay as much or more than PC gamers? Because that is just completely untrue. Yes there are tons of console players who buy every game and pay for online. But a majority chunk of console players don't buy online services and buy two games or less a year.  On the other spectrum there's a ton of PC gamers who buy AAA games several times a year and also upgrade their parts, mouse and keyboard, monitors, and more.  Not to mention that a good PC can range from $600-$1000.  Your argument that my analogy is false is not true </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I said has nothing to do with monthly online subscriptions or overpriced games. Don't bring up something completely different from the basis of the argument. I understand console gamers pay for things that are a waste of money. My point though has nothing to do with that. My point is only that the PCMR sub unnecessarily shits on console gamers calling them "peasants" and mocking their "arrogance" when console gamers don't give a fuck about who's better and just want to play games. It's textbook elitism. 

In fact, the ultimate irony is that the guy who coined the term PCMR said it as a dig at the PC gamers who are elitists in a comparison to Nazi Germany's claim of their "master race", and ironically enough the largest PC gaming community, PCMR, took this as their name and wave it proud and high. It started as joke but the entire subreddit doesn't treat it as a joke at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly.  It's absurd how much the people on that subreddit are obsessed with trying to justify their $1500-$2000+ purchases.

I think deep down they're never satisfied and there's a deep jealousy within them of how simple console gamers just seem to be happy with what they have.

I've never met a PC gamer who wasn't constantly thinking about upgrading the parts instead of just playing the fucking games. </TEXT>

<TITLE> PC Aryan Race, and why I left </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-05 23:07:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The sub pcmasterrace is originally what got me into PC gaming, and I loved my PC for the last year I've owned it. Now I need to get into my other hobbies more seriously and decided to sell my PC as serious gaming isn't for me, which is okay, to each his own. 

However, that subreddit which I thought was just about the love of high graphics, framerates, and such turned out to be a subreddit just filled with too many angry dudes who keep shitting on console owners who they claim are saying "console is better than PC." 

I've never met one console owner who goes on about how his console is superior to a PC in terms of gaming. When I meet console owners the only thing they tell me is "what game do you wanna play?" or "check out this new game I got." 

Yet, every PC owner I meet just goes on about the PC's expensive GPU and CPU and about how much RAM and how many fans it has.

The dudes on PC master race are obsessed with creating this faux war so they can make themselves feel good about something. They're obsessed with making this faux war larger and larger so they can feel like supreme winners about something in their life. In reality 99% of console owners have no awareness of this "war" and just continue playing their games and going on with life. 

I understand that PC owners want to make people aware that they are often getting jipped by the corporations and that there's a way to play that exists with better graphics and such. Still, in every industry there's people who are getting better and often more expensive products than others, but aren't taking the time to shit on those who have lesser, shittier products.

For example, I've never seen a group of dudes with nicer clothes come together and circle jerk about a guy with a lower budget wearing clothes from a more economically viable retailer. I've never seen a BMW owner go on to a dude with a low budget Honda about how he needs to install "cool-air intake" and a "body kit" onto his Accord.

PC Gaming is cool. The masterrace subreddit is cool at times. But the incessant angry dudes need to chill the F out.

Unfortunately hundreds of arguments will break out, particularly when Alex Jones tells Amy Schumer that she's a product of the Hollywood psychic vampire paedaphiles, and Ronda Rousey tries to take on Eddie Bravo but Eddie unleashes chemtrails from his ass and destroys her, all while James Hetfield lets out a resounding "YEEAHHH!".  

Meanwhile Jamie's fingers will be bleeding by an hour in after having "pulled up" a record 6,000 videos, and the livestream will have over 100,000 continuous viewers.

Joe will rake in the dough and ONNIT will sell out of Alpha Brain within minutes of the usual "...and thats O-N-N-I-T..."

<TEXT> I too have had depression, anxiety, ADD, and severe anhedonia since childhood.  Over the last many years I've tried about 12 or so antidepressants, talk therapy, TMS therapy, ketamine infusions, ADD medicines, different supplements, exercise, occasional meditation, and lifestyle changes.  I've never gotten better, only progressively worse.

I'm currently 23 almost 24 and every single way you described life is how I too experience it day in day out.  I'm so sorry you're suffering and have been suffering for a long time through the same torturous hell.  Mentally I want to do everything, I want to eat foods, I want to socialize, and play sports, and my guitar, and have sex, and explore the amazing things life has, but 24/7 365 I physically in my body feel no real appetite, no desire to do any hobbies, socialize, have sex, or anything.  Everything I do provides me the same joy as if I've been staring at a rock for hours.  It's the most underratedly worst hell and way of being alive.  Every moment of my life feels as if I'm sitting in a waiting room with no form of entertainment or anything and just the wall to stare at while I wait, in this case for eternity.

I'm hoping to get testosterone replacement therapy because I just found out my T is low, but the issue is docs won't give me TRT because the system is very screwed up so I found a clinic which might treat me but I'm not sure yet.  Moreover, even though the T is important I believe it won't help my anhedonia and depression significantly because I've lost hope in anything doing that.  And I'm really in the same situation you are, in that I've tried almost everything, so now what?  I also heard psilocybin can help and I'm definitely gonna try that, but tbh I was told the same thing for a long time about ketamine infusions and they didn't help me at all, so I don't have any hope anything will help.

Living this way is truly terrible and I really haven't been surviving.  If I don't find something that helps soon I won't stick around much longer.  Life is not worth living like this.  Not one day is filled with joy.  Only deep dark lonely pain.  The only thing thats ever gotten me through has been that I believed something would work for me and get me healthy, but now I don't believe that anymore.  

I hope things go okay with you and I'll pm you my phone number in case you want a digital pen pal to message with because its so hard going this alone. I'm here for you

<TITLE> My Top 5 Metallica songs </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-02 05:27:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In no particular order because they're all so perfect in different ways it's so hard to compare songs which fit different categories. In my opinion these five songs are all written perfectly and deserve five out of five stars each for what they manage to achieve in the sound/vibe they're going after.  In parentheses I explain in my opinion what each song is best at in their catalog. I would love to hear your guys' opinions and what your top songs are and why:

Fade to Black (their most emotionally gut-wrenching and saddest song, plus the most melodic Metallica solo ever imo with the opening Kirk solo)

Master of Puppets (imo it's their most epic thrash masterpiece and truly the best classic-themed thrash song ever made)

Creeping Death (such a fucking intense and rapid thrash experience, and imo the best written Metallica solo and metal solo of all time)

Nothing Else Matters (their song which reaches your heart and breaks through all bullshit that could possibly exist and makes you remember who you are. this song could motivate a person to face any and every fear they could possibly encounter, to destroy anybody or anything that tries to get in the way of what's important to them, and personally this song pumps adrenaline into my veins and makes me feel alive and completely unafraid of anything when I hear it)

One (without a doubt their most intense, grittiest, darkest, and overall rage filled track that they ever wrote. The first half is an amazing lead up, and when the song begins to shift and the guitars go fucking epic playing those intense machine gun chords I literally lose my mind. That stuff showcases Metallica's most fucking intense and angriest music ever. Imo, this song was the pinnacle of Metallica's ascendence into harder and grittier music. They began with punk style thrash in Kill Em' All and transitioned to harder music with each progressive album, culminating in ...And Justice For All being their hardest and most intense album. So intense and gritty that I think it was just natural that The Black Album was them lowering back down to earth after producing their most intense album previously)

<TEXT> u/blindcolumn you're extremely lucky you're anhedonia has subsided and I'm so pleased to hear another soul isn't suffering.  It truly is hell

/u/Pongpianskul I've been going for about 13 years now of suffering severe anhedonia, and 7-8 years of it being extremely severe.  I've tried legit almost everything under the sun for treatment with no success.  It is truly the worst hell I've ever endured and I don't think it will ever end.  

If any of you are familiar with the song ["One"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT6vqeL-ysI) by Metallica, it's about a man who loses all his limbs, his hearing, and his vision from a landmine in a war.  He can't do or really experience anything anymore, but his mind is fully conscious and awake and he is only suffering with silence and never-ending emptiness.  Still, he can't kill himself or communicate for someone to kill him because he has no limbs and cannot speak or see.  He is stuck living in hell and cannot escape.  This is how I feel every moment of my life, because I can't kill myself but all I experience is never-ending emptiness.  This song helps a bit, but then again, nothing ever truly helps rid this emptiness... </TEXT>

I just want to let you know because many people fall into a trap where they find one that's working and then think the medicine will never poop out, but it happens very often unfortunately.  Again I'm not trying to put you down, I'm just saying so you can line up more antidepressant treatment options ahead of time in case this one ever stops working.

Doctors neglect to tell you these things and its very unfortunate because when the medicine stops working people have no idea what's going on and they waste so much time feeling shitty when it really could just be time to up the dose or switch to a new medicine. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Questions about 2015 Macbook 12" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-27 23:53:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I currently have a 2011 11" Macbook Air and the trackpad is having tiny issues that I don't like and the fan gets so loud from basic things and I'm likely going to sell it on eBay.  I bought it last year for very very cheap on eBay and can probably sell it and break even from what I originally paid.

For my next computing device I don't want a tablet or windows laptop because I very much like MacOS and how smooth my experience with it has always been for years including with apps like Pages, Mail, TextEdit, and so many other things.  I also can't use a mobile architecture like on iOS or an iPad because I need basic file creation and Finder as a must.

I mainly use my laptop for web browsing, Youtube, Netflix, listening to music on iTunes and spotify, studying with flashcards with Anki, word processing, and small things like rosetta stone and Mail.  I love having a lightweight and small computer and I think the Macbook 12" 2015 model is perfect and I found some on eBay for $700 in good condition.

**I just have a couple questions for anyone who has owned one:**

1. I know it's fanless and therefore silent, but does it still overheat regularly and from common things like the Macbook 11" does?
1. Is the battery life good? On my Macbook 11" I usually only get about three hours
1. Is the different style keyboard better or worse? and can you get used to it easily?
1. What do you do in a scenario where you need the charger to be plugged in so you can also backup to an external harddrive, even though you only have one USB port?

Thanks guys. Would love to hear any other experiences, comments, or good and bad things about this device and whether you recommend I get it.

I can't believe how much when I was younger I believed that doctor's words were cannon and that they couldn't be ignorant or wrong.  WOW do I know that's not true now after all these years of being led down the wrong treatment paths.

I will try to get a second opinion, I just have concerns that either the doctors will to be too expensive or won't prescribe me TRT to begin with </TEXT>

Kratom is truly great though.  When I take it every so often it helps for about two plus hours each time, but when I take it more than twice a week it doesn't work so much and makes me too sleepy and dehydrated

<TEXT> I've never attempted suicide but I've been close enough to want to for thousands of days.

I know deep down that if I ever attempt it won't be unless im positive I need to go.  If I ever attempted it would be in the most lethal way that I was almost 100% sure would work, such as jumping from a tall bridge or shooting myself.

The issue is that I desperately want to live.  I've seen life through the lens of it being good.  I know there's always a way to change my life around.  It's not that though.  The issue is that the persistent feelings of sadness and anhedonia never ever go away.  I know I don't want to kill myself, but therein always comes the next question to which I have no answer: what do I do to feel better? I've tried so much I don't see any options left for treatment </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for that response that really helped man

These were my numbers for testosterone:

**First blood test**

* Total Testosterone: 288 ng/dl
* Free Testosterone: not measured in this one



**Second blood test**

* Total Testosterone: 417 ng/dl 
* Free Testosterone:  7.9 (I forget the unit type..)

My endocrinologist says the average range is 348-1100 for total T and says mine are okay but I know that this range factors in men up to their 90's and that the normal/ideal range for someone my age is 650-750 or higher. I'm also experiencing all the symptoms of low T so it just makes sense...

I'm just not sure how to find a doc or clinic that will treat me </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm almost 24 years old and I've been suffering from depression, anxiety, and ADD my whole life. My main symptom that I can never get over is the emptiness/anhedonia and I'm always tired and low energy and low sex drive and low concentration. I never have an appetite and nothing brings me any warm pleasure inside. It makes every moment of my life so painful.

I see so many posts of people on here who I know haven't tried hard yet and are already giving up and how terrible things are for them. I look at them and see so much hope that some therapy, some medication, some experimental thing will work that they haven't tried yet. 

Then I look at myself who's tried everything to get better and I want to die. I've tried 12 different antidepressants long term, I've tried 8 different ADD meds, I've tried ketamine infusions, TMS therapy, countless supplements, and now after finding out my testosterone levels are very low but not low enough for my doctor to give me replacement hormone therapy I want to die. There's nothing worse than being told for years that something will work and that there's hope and for years after years trying everything and never feeling any better.

My mind is in bit of a better place, and therapy and meditating has helped that, but in my body I feel like hell every moment of my life. Not sure what to do anymore please please help

<TEXT> **First blood test**

* Total Testosterone: 288 ng/dl
* Free Testosterone: not measured in this one



**Second blood test**

* Total Testosterone: 417 ng/dl 
* Free Testosterone:  7.9 (I forget the unit type..)

I'm 23 almost 24 and experience low sex drive, low energy, anhedonia, irritability, trouble sleeping, brain fog, etc.  (tried countless antidepressants, ketamine infusions, TMS, and stimulants and nothing worked.  My mind is in a good place but mentally I'm foggy all the time and my body always feels tired and super low energy)

Are my T levels normal or optimal?  My doc says the average range is 348-1100 for total T and says mine are okay but I know that this range factors in men up to their 90's and that the normal/ideal range for someone my age is 650-750 or higher, and moreover I'm experiencing all the symptoms of low-T so I need your thoughts because I'm considering going to a clinic or different doc for a second opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just realized having too many hobbies equates to little mastery or true fulfillment in any of them.  Everyone's time is so limited to begin with after work and daily life that its important to narrow down to your most important hobbies and eliminate the rest as much as possible.

I love playing guitar and basketball and going to the gym and a bunch more things and i realized i had too many hobbies and was spending too much time on the ones that were the easiest but gave me the least fulfillment such as playing video games.  

I also am a believer now that you shouldn't keep anything you don't really plan on using again (unless you truly value it as a collectible which is an acceptable exception), so I sold my old PSP, my GameCube, my Xbox 360, my Gameboy Micro, and all their games and am in the process of selling my gaming PC because I don't value using these things as much as I value my other hobbies, and so I realized I don't plan on using them anymore.  The only console I kept was my N64 and the EverDrive I have for it because I value my N64 as a party console with friends and its portable enough for traveling with to places.

I read these posts while in the process of making these decisions and they really helped me decide what was right for me:

<TEXT> Jocko Podcast is great if you're into hardcore military motivation and a disciplined lifestyle. 


Stuff You Should Know is a good one if you're in the mood to learn something interesting from two nerdy dudes. I like listening to it when I get in the same mood as I would be in to go to a museum or read a history book.


The Ben Shapiro Show is my go to for when I'm in a shitty mood because the way Ben uses his high IQ and intellect to destroy assholes and dumbasses makes me feel all warm inside.

<DATE> 2017-02-20 13:50:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have anhedonic depression which my doc thinks is centered in dopamine deficiency or disregulation. I've gotten one low T test done and came back 288 and I'm 23 years old and was told it should be much higher. I'm doing a second test tomorrow morning and want to know if anyone here experienced lack of pleasure, appetite, sex drive, etc. and after TRT got better

Some added info, I've been on 12 different antidepressants, TMS therapy, six ketamine infusions, done diet change, exercise, meditation, years of talk therapy, and no change. Mentally my outlook is great, but in my body I feel like hell and can't experience pleasure, so every day is an emotional hell.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an everdrive 2.5 but I don't have Pokemon Stadium 2 on it because I don't play it and like the original game better. Interestingly enough the only physical game I have besides the everdrive is that exact game Pokemon stadium 2. 

I'm currently selling it though because honestly if I can use the original game on the everdrive do I really need to keep a game I won't play? I would say get version 2.5 and just use Pokemon Stadium 1 because from what I remember Pokemon stadium 2 does in fact have confirmed issues with this everdrive version. Not worth the upgrade  </TEXT>

On another note, the first time I went to Five Guys id had it hyped up in my mind for years by others before going there myself. I went with two friends and was blown away completely even with my already very high expectations. Some things just deliver, and five years later and hundreds of burgers probably I still love five guys just like the first time. </TEXT>

Since he worked for FedEx before he gets stranded he feels that if saves that package and doesn't open it its a reminder to him that he will one day ultimately deliver that package and get off the island.  That's why he doesn't open it, because keeping that package closed is literally keeping his hope alive that he will one day leave the island </TEXT>

EDIT:  Obviously knew dweller-virgins would downvote me, but sometimes the truth just needs to spoken, even if this sub and reddit in general like to circlejerk till the end of time.  You can downvote me but deep down ask yourself and you know its true.  The same people that like video game pussy get off to anime porn and that's pretty sad shit there </TEXT>

<TEXT> its so easy to feel like you're the only one ya know. i mean have you ever seen a room of 500 people? imagine how many people in that room have how many different issues.  Now imagine a room of a thousand people and all their issues and problems.  Now think about the world.  There are enough people in the world to fill 7 million rooms of 1000 people each.  Think about all those issues right? Sudddenly its so easy to see how our problems can consume us and make us feel so separate from the world when its not true, so many out there are suffering and have issues too and none of us should feel like freaks </TEXT>

<TEXT> unfortunately the solution isn't to keep resisting or learn to resist more than you already are. Resisting indefinitely eventually results in the ultimate resistance: resistance of everyday life itself. When this happens you become suicidal and resent every moment you're awake and every morning when you find you're still alive after falling asleep the night before you're filled with dread and terrible feelings.


All of us only have one true real solution unfortunately, as difficult and as fucked up as it is sometimes to find the strength and courage to keep going forward. Resisting ultimately will always lead to the path of the ultimate resistance of life itself, and eventually daily suicidal thoughts and maybe even suicide itself. The only real option any of us have is to keep going forward. Somehow, some way, we have to carry on, or if not suicide will always be the only other answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> anxiety sucks, it makes you feel like you cant breathe and like you cant do anything. depression (severe in particular) is much worse, it is this dark biological/mental darkness which makes you believe in the worst of things and prevents you from feeling anything but utter darkness. 

Trying to combat this utter darkness by just "pushing through until its 'better'" doesn't work when the depression is very severe and or treatment resistant (like mine is). I've pushed through for years and gotten nowhere with ever feeling better, that's why some problems that just don't seem to have answers yet (or maybe not at all) are better to just talk about and share with others so we don't feel like freaks or hate ourselves thinking we are strange fucked up people for having these issues.  

When we talk with other people (like on this subreddit) we see that we aren't freaks or bad people, we just have chemical imbalances, issues with fear, and very bad and dark beliefs about anything and everything, just like many many many others do. Not one person facing any issue is even close to being alone in facing that issue, and in remembering so, we realize that we aren't horrible people. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm currently jailbroken on 9.3.3 on my iPhone 6 and have not been fully following the ongoing things in the jailbreak community the last couple weeks and am extremely out of the loop.


I like my current jailbreak but knowing that it will expire in like march or april (whenever that original certificate was set to expire) and when that time comes I'll have to like rejailbreak or something every 7 days I know that going on the next jailbreak is for the best. So I have not saved any blobs or anything yet and don't know how to do that, and I'm wondering if anyone can please tell me if the new jailbreaks are supposedly going to be stable soon and if whether or not ill have to do something similar like rejailbreaking every week or if those certificates will expire eventually too. Thanks for all your help everyone </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got my cortisol checked and came back normal. Idk man, if there's isn't something that I can find that will work I will kill myself. I can't live in this much pain every day. My life has already fallen apart because of it, I can't take anymore. If I don't find something I don't have any other choice but to die because it's been years of this now and I can't take anymore  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey your post related to me so much it's crazy. I'm 23 male, have severe depression and anxiety and ADD. I've tried over 14 medications for depression and anxiety, I've been seeing therapists for years, ive made lifestyle changes and have tried meditation, I've done TMS therapy and just finished a round of ketamine IV infusions two weeks ago, I've tried all sorts of supplements and nootropics, and no one thing has ever helped me. I have severe anhedonia too and when I was younger tried all sorts of ADD meds but couldn't tolerate any as I am extremely sensitive to side effects. At this point I'm not sure what to do and every day am so close to walking outside and killing myself. I've gotten all my levels tested many times too and the only thing that came back recently is that my testosterone level is low. I have an appointment with an endocrinologist tomorrow about that but tbh I really doubt that's the cause of all my depression, anhedonia, ADD, and anxiety. I like you deeply believe I have some sort of dopamine dysfunction or low dopamine issue that's been causing every one of these issues I've experienced my whole life. I just don't know what to do next I'm literally almost out of options and am close to death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this logic never makes any sense. why is one person's pain more important than another's? Why is my pain that is there every minute of every day unrelenting and that I've tried to fix with everything not worthy of dying for just because another person will encounter pain? Why is their pain more important than mine?

Humans do not try to be selfish as much as we can  but when it comes down to the single most important things in our existence, every human deserves the right to put himself first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if you get one it will only help for a bit, I've been severely depressed for so long, and I can say that after two relationships in the last two years I felt no better during them. Having sex helps distract you but then you still feel the same after just a couple weeks in a relationship. The only true salvation from depression and the way towards a better life is fixing the root cause of all the pain and hell, whether through medications or other types of therapies.  </TEXT>

The ideas like this surronding our culture make it so that people feel suicidal after breakups, after divorce, after the death of a loved one, etc.  If you  make anything or anyone at all the meaning of your world, when they inevitably move on from your life you will be left broken inside. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A simple way to put it, most mentally healthy people will be sad about a break up for a week or two and then move on. For me, as someone suffering from seriously intense depression and anxiety (and being unfortunate enough to have dated a manipulative devil) I became suicidally depressed daily for months and months on end. Now that's not some normal sadness.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My life is in complete shambles. I'm 23 and am almost broke and can't hold a job because of my extremely severe depression and panic disorder. I've been suicidal for a very long time and have been in and out the hospital and have tried almost everything. I am in serious debt and couldnt finish school and have no friends left and have been struggling by and haven't eaten much the last three weeks as my pantry is almost empty. There's a papa johns near me and i can make a pizza last for almost two days as I know how to ration well. It would mean so much to me. I love you all you guys in this subreddit btw.  My request wasn't fulfilled btw it just says "got pizza'd" from the past

**EDIT: Thank you u/Whisperers for the pizza gift card!** </TEXT>

<TITLE> Which Ashwagandha to buy off of NootropicsDepot? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-10 22:29:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking to purchase the best value one. I'm very new to nootropics and don't know the difference between these brands and if someone can explain to me the difference in powders too that would help a lot.  I see for example that the PURE ASHWAGANDHA ROOT EXTRACT 2.5% cost a lot less for a lot more grams than the other two and was wondering the difference between these three and what's the best overall option in terms of quality and price. I will be dosing daily at 400 mg 3 times a day.  Here are the options I see:

**Powders:**

* **[PURE ASHWAGANDHA ROOT EXTRACT 2.5%](http://nootropicsdepot.com/ashwagandha/)**

* **[SENSORIL OPTIMIZED ASHWAGANDHA EXTRACT POWDER (WITHANIA SOMNIFERA ROOT AND LEAF EXTRACT 10% WITHANOLIDES)](http://nootropicsdepot.com/sensoril-optimized-ashwagandha-extract-powder-withania-somnifera-root-and-leaf-extract-10-withanolides/)**

<TEXT> When 9.3.x's jailbreak came out this summer I jailbroke my iPhone 6 on 9.3.1 and have been back enjoying the jailbroken state since then. I installed all the tweaks I used to use on past jailbreaks and it's been great. However, I haven't really messed around and done any more with my jailbreak I'm a while because as of now I'm pretty sure everyone on this jailbreak's certificate expires in April and then the jailbreak will disappear. Please correct me if I'm wrong or any updates or solutions to this problem have come out since it was discovered, because as of now I really don't see a point in customizing my jailbreak anymore if it's going to just disappear soon. Please some help :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> It's this type of thinking that mainstream America thrives on that can often be very toxic </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In high school I developed this *hard* mentality on life where everything should be accomplished with intensity and sheer blunt force and intense motivation against the dark forces of fear, pain, and its subcategories such as procrastination, laziness, and avoidance.  I got interested in the marines and felt this ideology on how to approach life was awesome.  To this day I fully appreciate many different parts of this way of thinking, however, I no longer view it as the most important way or central of thinking.


With this ideology as my main way of thinking I used to burn out extremely easily, would almost always be motivated by fear or anger, and would always feel shitty, even just hours after reaching some success.  No matter what I did, I would never feel any peace at all, and everything I did would be about this desire to be *alpha* and extremely intense.  In my belief, this *need* and reinforcement to live through this state is what is largely contributing to the mental health issues of many depressed and suicidal veterans who are already suffering with PTSD and who are eventually taking their own lives.


Although some aspects of this way of thinking are important, using it as a main way of living is very very stressful and will leave one in a constant state of needing to be productive and produce results and be *intense*.

After reading The Power of Now six months ago and learning all about the spiritual and presence approach to living and about meditation, I've now begun to live my life in a much calmer much more peaceful way, approaching things not as intense problems but just as things that are to be dealt with or accepted.  

Looking at things from outside the box now, I always can't help but be amazed at the sheer absurdity of certain mindsets that the mainstream culture we have still upholds.  Posts like 
  **[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/57au97/image_my_hero_is_always_10_years_away/)** clearly express the flaws I'm speaking about regarding this culture of intensity and blunt force action we live in today.  It's not healthy at all to be chasing something that never comes, and will leave a person worn out and dejected, because as stated, the "hero" will never come.  I don't know about all of you, but I see past a lot of this "motivation" speak now and see that ideologies of balance and presence are the true keys to being able to be successful and or happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an iPhone 6 and am on 9.3.1, and I made a custom respring logo and followed a tutorial which said to place in a certain folder and duplicate the file 4 times for a total of five files in the folder. The tutorial then said to name the 4 duplicates as follows: (however didn't say what to the name the original so I just put it as logo.png)

* apple-logo@2x
* apple-logo@2x~iphone
* apple-logo@2x-iphoneapple-logo-black@2x

The next step was to go to winterboard and enable the theme and respring which I did. The respring logo worked but there's a white bar at the bottom. I tried to respring again and even tried rebooting and re-entering my jailbreak, but I still get the white bar. Need some help please :) </TEXT>

When I use enough benzoyl my skins gets better but it's in insane pain. When I don't use even a tiny bit less then enough I break out horribly. I can't keep doing this, but when I go to my dermatologist he goes oh your skin is fine you don't need a second accutane course and to try this cream such and such instead. I don't know what to do, but I need a second course of claravis and don't know how to get it, please help. </TEXT>

I miss my ex girlfriend every day of whom my relationship ended with in February. All my insurmountable problems and insane 13 years of extreme unhappiness and how much I miss her are pushing me to end it.  I can't overcome my problems.  I can't stop missing and thinking about her.  I have tried so hard for so long and now see and know there is no way my suffering will ever end except with my death.  I dont have a reason to hope. I don't have a reason to believe.  The problems I face are not able to be overcome.  I can't do this anymore. It's been months and months of the same feelings, I see the end in my eyes because I can't live any more.  I know the suffering that people have and I have aren't justified and don't happen for a reason, and I've essentially lost all my belief in god and truly everything else.  Please help me before I kill myself because I have so many infinite reasons to die and none to live even another day.  I have no more options, I can't suffer any longer </TEXT>

<TEXT> So two months ago my ex-girlfriend broke up with me because for the past 8 months I had been going through so much I neglected her all the time and pushed her away.  We had dated almost a year.  I had had so many issues and bad things happening but she too had some smaller ones.  There were so many times where I wanted to break up with her because I figured I could never be with her because of her small problems but I never wanted to break up because I loved her too much.  The last two months since she broke up with me my depression and anxiety got 1000x worse and I've literally been suffering from crippling panic attacks and insanely severe depression and dark thoughts almost all relating to her and not having her and wanting her back more than anything in the world.  Since we broke up I've been telling her I've been wanting her back and I that I've changed a lot.  A couple weeks ago I wrote a really long letter and printed out a picture of us both and was planning to bring both and flowers to her apartment at school in person and ask if she wanted to get coffee to talk.  Days before I was gonna go she texted me saying she needs to be single for a while.  I then called her and calmly talked and i even told her about what i was planning to do with the letter and things and she said at least until next semester starts in the fall she needs to be single. I asked her if in the fall we could have a chance at talking again and she said yes.  The next day after that she messaged me because she was at home and her mom made her really upset and she wanted to talk to me.  I went about the conversation calmly and said I do want a chance so bad in the fall but I understand she needs her time now and I respect that.  Later that night she messaged me drunk and the conversation was similar.  A week or so after that on a saturday night I saw about twenty minutes after she sent it she asked "can i come over" along with two missed calls at 1am. I then called her and she said can i come over and was at her friends house and I said of course you know I want that and she said actually let me call you back in ten I need to think if its a good idea or not. Twelve minutes went by and no call so I called her and went to voicemail.  Then she called me back a couple minutes after and said i didn't need to come.  Twenty minutes later I was in bed and my phone vibrated and she said she wanted to come to drive her to her apartment so I then left and got her.  Her apartment was ten minutes away and she was somewhat drunk and kissed me when she got in, then started crying about how I mistreated her, then I started talking calmly about how I want a chance so bad in the fall, then when I went to drop her off she said to park for a minute.  I did, then we started kissing, I put my hand up her shirt, she started giving me head for 40 seconds while I put my hand down her jeans to her ass, and then she said she needed to go.  I got out to help her and she said can we get back together, I said its what I want, then she said not until next semester while she was kind of crying.  The next morning she texted "sorry for last night."  I called her and said I just want a chance in the fall and she was like yes i already said yes but she was like I can't promise anything 1000%.  I then said I'm just worried she'll be with someone else and she then said its unlikely but obviously she can't promise 1000%. I then said I wouldn't message her for a couple months and she said okay.  Then a couple days later on this past friday morning I woke up to a text she sent an hour before which from her which said something bad happened.  Several hours later I went to her apartment to help her even though she was reluctant at first, I was there five minutes and she was slightly uncomfortable and I gave her the things I brought that she needed and then said I just want to know for sure about the fall and she was like we already talked about this then I said so yes? and then she said yeah but said that she cant guarantee 1000%. she then thanked me for the stuff and I left.  Then this morning I woke up to a missed call from her last night at 3:30 am when she was obviously drunk and so I texted her saying "I missed your call last night, is everything okay" and she messaged back "Yes I'm sorry for calling" and i didn't message back after.


I'm very sorry I made this so long I'm just very very very mentally sick right now and every little thing triggers me about her.  I stopped jacking off a week after we broke up because sex, sex stimuli, thoughts about sex or her literally make me truly want to die.  I can't even see commercials with females at the moment and any smell that reminds me of sex triggers me like crazy wanting to die because I don't have her and she's free now to have sex with other guys.  I know there's five months between now and next semester and that when i asked she said in the fall we can have a chance to talk again I'm just so scared she won't take me back or she'll meet someone else or change her mind.


Days after we broke up I jacked off to pictures of her boobs and her ass I have locked away that she had texted me so so so long and it was so bad because after I just missed her and wanted to die.  I used to have an addiction to porn and jacking off but was fading for over a year now and the last almost two months because of my severe triggers I didn't even want to and havent since a week after she broke up with me.


I don't have any desire at all to jack off literally none, and that is the truth, I just want to stop thinking about all these dark thoughts about her and I don't know if jacking off to regular porn would help me after I cum, like if part of my huge attraction to her will be subsided for some time because I'll feel more free.  I'm literally in the most pain ive ever experienced in my entire life and have been sleeping almost all day every day because everything else I try to do doesn't help.  I've been on zoloft three weeks now after trying other things for the last many months that didn't work but it isn't working yet.  I have two therapist appointments this week and one appointment Wednesday with the psychiatrist where I'll ask him to increase my zoloft dose because it isn't working yet and for xanax which I know he won't give me because he never does.  I almost went to the hospital many times the past couple weeks and especially the last couple days because i literally can't exist at the moment.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So two months ago my ex-girlfriend broke up with me because for the past 8 months I had been going through so much I neglected her all the time and pushed her away.  We had dated almost a year.  I had had so many issues and bad things happening but she too had some smaller ones.  There were so many times where I wanted to break up with her because I figured I could never be with her because of her small problems but I never wanted to break up because I loved her too much.  The last two months since she broke up with me my depression and anxiety got 1000x worse and I've literally been suffering from crippling panic attacks and insanely severe depression and dark thoughts almost all relating to her and not having her and wanting her back more than anything in the world.  Since we broke up I've been telling her I've been wanting her back and I that I've changed a lot.  A couple weeks ago I wrote a really long letter and printed out a picture of us both and was planning to bring both and flowers to her apartment at school in person and ask if she wanted to get coffee to talk.  Days before I was gonna go she texted me saying she needs to be single for a while.  I then called her and calmly talked and i even told her about what i was planning to do with the letter and things and she said at least until next semester starts in the fall she needs to be single. I asked her if in the fall we could have a chance at talking again and she said yes.  The next day after that she messaged me because she was at home and her mom made her really upset and she wanted to talk to me.  I went about the conversation calmly and said I do want a chance so bad in the fall but I understand she needs her time now and I respect that.  Later that night she messaged me drunk and the conversation was similar.  A week or so after that on a saturday night I saw about twenty minutes after she sent it she asked "can i come over" along with two missed calls at 1am. I then called her and she said can i come over and was at her friends house and I said of course you know I want that and she said actually let me call you back in ten I need to think if its a good idea or not. Twelve minutes went by and no call so I called her and went to voicemail.  Then she called me back a couple minutes after and said i didn't need to come.  Twenty minutes later I was in bed and my phone vibrated and she said she wanted to come to drive her to her apartment so I then left and got her.  Her apartment was ten minutes away and she was somewhat drunk and kissed me when she got in, then started crying about how I mistreated her, then I started talking calmly about how I want a chance so bad in the fall, then when I went to drop her off she said to park for a minute.  I did, then we started kissing, I put my hand up her shirt, she started giving me head for 40 seconds while I put my hand down her jeans to her ass, and then she said she needed to go.  I got out to help her and she said can we get back together, I said its what I want, then she said not until next semester while she was kind of crying.  The next morning she texted "sorry for last night."  I called her and said I just want a chance in the fall and she was like yes i already said yes but she was like I can't promise anything 1000%.  I then said I'm just worried she'll be with someone else and she then said its unlikely but obviously she can't promise 1000%. I then said I wouldn't message her for a couple months and she said okay.  Then a couple days later on this past friday morning I woke up to a text she sent an hour before which from her which said something bad happened.  Several hours later I went to her apartment to help her even though she was reluctant at first, I was there five minutes and she was slightly uncomfortable and I gave her the things I brought that she needed and then said I just want to know for sure about the fall and she was like we already talked about this then I said so yes? and then she said yeah but said that she cant guarantee 1000%. she then thanked me for the stuff and I left.  Then this morning I woke up to a missed call from her last night at 3:30 am when she was obviously drunk and so I texted her saying "I missed your call last night, is everything okay" and she messaged back "Yes I'm sorry for calling" and i didn't message back after.


I'm very sorry I made this so long I'm just very very very mentally sick right now and every little thing triggers me about her.  I stopped jacking off a week after we broke up because sex, sex stimuli, thoughts about sex or her literally make me truly want to die.  I can't even see commercials with females at the moment and any smell that reminds me of sex triggers me like crazy wanting to die because I don't have her and she's free now to have sex with other guys.  I know there's five months between now and next semester and that when i asked she said in the fall we can have a chance to talk again I'm just so scared she won't take me back or she'll meet someone else or change her mind.


Days after we broke up I jacked off to pictures of her boobs and her ass I have locked away that she had texted me so so so long and it was so bad because after I just missed her and wanted to die.  I used to have an addiction to porn and jacking off but was fading for over a year now and the last almost two months because of my severe triggers I didn't even want to and havent since a week after she broke up with me.


I don't have any desire at all to jack off literally none, and that is the truth, I just want to stop thinking about all these dark thoughts about her and I don't know if jacking off to regular porn would help me after I cum, like if part of my huge attraction to her will be subsided for some time because I'll feel more free.  I'm literally in the most pain ive ever experienced in my entire life and have been sleeping almost all day every day because everything else I try to do doesn't help.  I've been on zoloft three weeks now after trying other things for the last many months that didn't work but it isn't working yet.  I have two therapist appointments this week and one appointment Wednesday with the psychiatrist where I'll ask him to increase my zoloft dose because it isn't working yet and for xanax which I know he won't give me because he never does.  I almost went to the hospital many times the past couple weeks and especially the last couple days because i literally can't exist at the moment.  


I know I need medicine to start working immeadielty and to start making changes and getting healthy for myself first and I won't message her probably until july at all and I have to wait till the fall, it's just ive been talking to my friend and my sister and my parents about this im just terrified in the fall five months from now she wont take me back or that she'll change her mind or she won't give me a chance or tell me that she's met someone else even though its unlikely or that she'll tell me she just want to move on.

<TEXT> My friend who has built 3 PC's before this built my PC three days ago.  I was with him when he built it but I didn't know how to build really. He's very good at this stuff and says everything is almost 100% definitely in the right places and connected properly. 


So here's where I'm at now. Two days ago I powered it on and it turns on fine and the fans spin and everything and even the GPU light is on and its fans are spinning too, but I connected an HDMI cord to the GPU's port first and then tried the motherboard's port and neither showed anything on my monitor's screen.  I am very much a newb and don't know if I need to use a keyboard and hold down a button when starting to see anything or if I need to connect an optical drive with an install disc to the PC or a flash drive with the windows install ISO, or if its something else.  

When I say nothing shows up on the monitor I mean not even a black screen, the monitor literally doesn't detect the PC is connected.  I've tried my friend's monitor too and to no avail.  I also know its not the cord because I use this cord for a projector all the time.

Also here is my build list:

And here is what the GPU ports and Motherboard ports look like:

<TITLE> PLEASE HELP: Off Paxil six and half weeks ago, extremely depressed right now (X-POST from r/depression) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-27 00:40:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was on anti-depressants for about 2.5 years, and was most recently on paxil for 1.5 of those last years. Six and a half weeks ago I took my last pill. The first almost two weeks of the withdrawal were hell with me feeling depressed, angry, just awful. Then starting during the third week from the last pill i felt amazing and that continued for about another 3 days, totaling about 10 days of feeling good. Even since then my thoughts and progress in life is great and NOTHING IN MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED. However, after those ten days I started to literally feel pshycially and emotionally fucked sad and depressed. Since then, about three weeks ago, I have been extremely depressed and very very sad and close to the edge. My conclusions have been that it's either still some weird shit from the withdrawal and that I need to give it more time to feel better, OR that this is the real me and I need to do something.

PLEASE HELP ME, i've never felt so sad and depressed for such a continuous period. People that have been on paxil please can you help me to tell me if you experienced something similar or anyone else please give me your conclusions/answers on this. thank you </TEXT>

The thing is I need Aria 2 for my music app. If anyone has a way to customize the music search bar at all that would be perfect.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for people's help, I bought almost every part necessary so far for the next-gen exterminator build. I just have two important questions if someone can help me out promptly.

**FIRST:** 

does the exterminator build thats listed right now in the build guides (which is the one i purchased my items with) give the PC built in wifi?? 

**SECOND:**

I see that the exterminator build doesn't say to get any fans or cooling items. won't it need something like that? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The "Next-Gen Crusher" Build or "Next-Gen Exterminator" ??? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-24 02:49:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've finally decided it is time to ascend, as my xbox 360 just isn't cutting it, and the longest I've ever had online play was 1 month in total in almost ten years of ownership. 

I have narrowed it down to either the crusher or exterminator builds, and I'll get the exact items listed in each build to make things simple for buying. I wanted initially to get the crusher build as it is more than $300 cheaper, only, I figure since I'm upgrading in the first place I desire to run all my games at 1080p 60FPS.  I know both builds are supposed to be able to do this, while the exterminator obviously being much better at it, but my question is will the crusher still run basically all the games I desire at the settings I mentioned above? I don't want to purchase something saving several hundred if its just not worth it in the first place.

At the same time, it's quite difficult to justify shelling out another three hundred bucks for the exterminator if the crusher can already perform essentially all my desired games at 1080p 60fps.

I am unsure if I want an oculus, because I think its best to wait a couple years for the technology to lower in price and get better before making such a large investment, but I know that the exterminator will be oculus ready if I chose so.  HOWEVER, my thought process is that although the exterminator is oculus ready right now, if I buy an oculus in 2-4 years from now, which is the MINIMUM amount of time I would wait to buy an oculus for gaming, will the exterminator if I would build it right now STILL be perfectly great for newer oculus technology that's released in 2-4 years? or i will i need to upgrade processors and graphics card or ram all over again?

**PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS DIFFICULT DECISION BETWEEN THE CRUSHER AND EXTERMINATOR! ALSO SIDE NOTE, THIS PC WILL ALSO BE USED FOR KODI A LOT OF THE TIME.**

**LIST of games I plan on playing (whether through steam, origin, or other console emulation):**

*gta 5
*just cause 3
*modern warfare 3
*cod world at war
*cod black ops 2 or 3
*halo 1
*gears of war

<TITLE> What are your Pax 2 using methods? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-13 05:56:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two days ago I posted whether or not to keep my pax 2, tried some different things and got super blazed off of it twice now since then and have decided I fucking love the pax and am keeping it.

I am curious about everyone's exact method of using the pax 2, and by exact method I mean down to the seconds of everything.

Since two days ago I first grind my herb very fine, and pack it with some wiggle room. Next I start on a 2 then progress to a 3 and then 4. I take 7-8 hits on each setting.  For my hits, I inhale hard for 4 seconds, hold for 1.5 seconds, then wait for exactly 15 seconds until my next hit and repeat. I don't stir my package at all.

Doing this got me blazed for 2.5-3 hours with a nice clear heavy head high and slight/moderate body high.

What are your exact methods? I'm very curious to hear and hear the results you have.

<TITLE> Should I sell my pax 2? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm very very conflicted over whether or not to sell my pax 2 to someone who wants to buy that is offering cash right now. Ive had my pax for several months but never can get really high off of it. If I ever do get high it lasts for so little time. When I use it it takes like 10-15 minutes to feel anything compared to a bong which takes 10 seconds.  I need a strong arguement on it right now because part of me wants to keep it because everyone says online they can get high off of it, but everytime I try I can't get really high. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I've never got blitzed to like a 6 out of 10 or higher 

EDIT: managed to find a method to get UBER BLITZED with my pax, fucking love it now, awesome device. KEEPING IT!!!! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was a grasshopper follower, (never got a chance to preorder), i spoke to trevor back last may about getting my preorder out in july, its already december, and almost two years or whatever since the campaign ended. I used to check this subreddit twice a month. but stopped back in mid august when they said they were almost ready. my curiosity somehow overcame me today and i wanted to check this subreddit and expected to see loads and loads of forums of people talking about their grasshoppers, sharing pictures, etc. this is just fucking hilarious to come here today after not being here in almost 5 months, and see that absolutely zero has changed. sorry to say guys, my guess is those of you that preordered arn't getting them until next december, as in december 2015 at the EARLIEST. most likely sometime in 2016. and this im sure of. this just cracked me the fuck up coming back here to look at this page. I feel really sorry for you guys who donated money to their campaign and expected results. i understand its a gamble with shit like indiegogo, but nevertheless, this is still fucking hilarious how these guys at the grasshopper team have been pulling everyone's balls saying "oo its coming soon" for almost two years now. these dudes are taking so long that i quit weed in the time its been taking them just to get little parts months and months apart! all i know is, this did provide me a nice laugh and a smh moment. just wow </TEXT>

<TEXT> like many of you im assumming, i was hoping to make the grasshopper my first vape, and was planning on getting in on the preorders after i messaged trevor. welp, looks like thats not happening for months. dont spend you're summer without a good vape. im seeing eminem, going skydiving, going camping, and going baked to six flags and some crazy shit. and i definitely dont wanna be vapeless during these times. so ive decided its time to either purchase a pax. fuck what u say about conduction or the price or shit. at least i can press buy and itll be in my mail within three days with a free grinder. i encourage you all to join me :)

ps: if not, have fun w/ bitches on the beach without vapes this summer </TEXT>
