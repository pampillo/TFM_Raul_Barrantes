<TEXT> yea he was big before we knew who Armin and Tiesto were. Paul Van Dyk, John Digweed are more from his era. He had a very popular Essential mixes from around the world hosted by Pete Tong. The time when we first discovered MP3s and Napster, his global mixes were the big part of my download collection (Sydney, Shanghai, moscow, Goa, Miami and my personal fav Havana) I still have those MP3 somewhere...but youtube has most of them. Hope you can get into it!

<TEXT> 2002 325cic here, I live in Watertown and I moved here from DC area. The big (unforeseen) mistake I made is installing bilstein pss kit which lowers the car dramatically, even on the highest setting. Was awesome on DC streets but is beyond painful on Boston streets (The road quality here is terrible!!). Also want to pass on feedback on a fantastic mechanic in Belmont area - Boston Motor Werks - he is resonable and goes well beyond the extra mile. My first visit to him he gave me a full report of my car (carfax, recall history, all engine readouts and a future log of routine maintenance which he confirmed was performed or not by a thorough inspection) all included with fixing the issue i brought it in, in the first place. Good Luck and enjoy!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> a good write up on the oil separator: Product Details

The experts at ECS Tuning have assembled a kit to include everything that you need to get your oil separator system back into order.
BMW has an ongoing issue with oil separators freezing in cold weather if driving is done before the vehicle is fully warmed up. There is often a howling noise followed by numerous oil leaks. The crankcase breather valve is used to purge the oil vapor from the engine block into the valve cover. However, sometimes condensation can cause it to freeze, causing the entire oil separator system to fail, crack, and disintegrate.
Replace all the components of the oil separator system together to prevent damage to all the aspects of your engine. As long as you have everything off, you can rest assured that new parts will last and be reliable.
Our Level 1 kit includes the following;
Oil separator
Hose from oil separator to dipstick tube
Hose from oil separator to valve cover
Hose from intake manifold back to the connector hose
Hose from oil separator up to the intake manifold
It is highly recommended to replace the oil dipstick tube with the updated design by BMW as this also a common place for sludge to build up. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 02 325 ci - Clutch pedal dropped </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-14 13:17:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A quick story - I was getting off the highway entering my work's parking lot when the clutch pedal dropped and had no pressure. It was mid switching gears and I was rolling in neutral. The car was moving enough that I was able to push the stick into 2nd by rev-matching and got it to my parking spot. The issue is most likely the slave cylinder (located on trans) but I could not do any repairs myself in the parking lot (the car is lowered). I decided to make it to my mechanic 30 miles with no clutch pedal. Once I started the car, from a dead stop, I put pressure on the first gear and the car slowly started to move forward before the gear was engaged, eventually the gear engaged once it was going about 5mph. Controlling my revs, I switched it to 2nd and then 4th (3rd the gear grinded and didn't force it further). I got to the highway without stopping (lucky green light) and kept it in 4th until i got off highway. One redlight screwed me up but I pulled it out of gear to roll to a stop and pressed the first gear to get it moving (it takes about 10 seconds before I could get the 1st to engage with Hazards blinking). All in all I made it and it didn't seem like I caused too much harm to the trans. Just in case any one here is in similar situation, it can be done! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a e46 325 so I'm sure there are engine calibrations/valve adjustments type things I am not aware of that the M requires, but do inspect all suspension components (bushings, tie rods, strut mounts etc) The car looks lowered, do you know what suspension is currently used? Also once the car is warmed up, stop the car facing up hill and try to take off a little aggressive to note any clutch slip. The car should have had at least one clutch replacement..if not its due! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, I want to add that when downshifting, you can apply pressure to the desired gear for a few seconds (not actually pushing it into the desired gear) after an engine blip. This will allow the synchro's to match up and you will feel the stick 'fall in to' the gear. This is also how you can change gears without the clutch but NOT Recommended. I hope I am explaining this well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My GF and I love current movies but cannot sit through a black and white movie (or anything before the 80's). Realizing there must be classics that we will probably love, can you guys suggest some? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can this study begin to explain why there are so many angry people on the internet (YouTube comments for example)? People providing feedback online seem generally angry and even hostile. Personally this is why I enjoy Reddit because they do a great job of filtering out the anger somehow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got my E46 325CIc back from getting Thermostat, Coolant hoses, Water pump, Thermal expansion bottle, and radiator replaced and now it over heats in traffic or waiting at a drive thru. I noticed the Radiator fan does not turn on. Since it is easy to remove (Manual Trans) I inspected the connections and all looks good. Any suggestion on next step? Or where to buy a quality, long lasting Radiator Fan? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I have the same issue. Here is when my fault happens:
When Top is Up (closed) the red light blinks as if not closed completely and will not move in any director by pressing button.
I can manually put it down (i got a small auto-driver with an allen)
When top is Down (open) I can press close button, it will go up half way (looks like the picture) and just stops.

I did read there are position sensors in the harness, and if 1 goes bad it stops. I haven't tried to fix it. Anyone have a solution? </TEXT>
