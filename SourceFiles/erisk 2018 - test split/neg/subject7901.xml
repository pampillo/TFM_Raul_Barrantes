<TEXT> Impeachment won't happen until Congress flips in 2018.  The movement to impeach, however, must start now.  It should be the centerpiece of movement to restore a decent respect for human rights everywhere.
#ImpeachPenceFirst should be the slogan.  What did Pence know and when did he know it?  Mister Clean has no credibility.  Flynn is not the only liar funded by the Oligarch International.  Investigative reporting will be the key to making the case against Pence.
Then impeach Trump.  Using the office of President for personal enrichment is reason enough.
Then select a Majority Leader in the House who Americans would trust as President.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obama's comfort level with Wall Street is hard to shake.  You can't manufacture revulsion at the rot that's running our world into the ground.  Obama, like Hillary, just thinks that Wall Street people are intelligent, civil, and, given that they have the power and always will, the best strategy is to convince them that it is in their interest to leave some gleanings in the field to sustain the unfortunate -- rather than scooping up everything.  What they feel is: Wall Street is family, even if they're a bit too greedy. Let's talk.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Increased competition from cheap natural gas is responsible for 49 percent of the decline in domestic US coal
consumption. Lower-than-expected demand is responsible for 26 percent, and the growth in renewable energy
is responsible for 18 percent. Environmental regulations have played a role in the switch from coal to natural gas and renewables in US electricity supply by accelerating coal plant retirements, but were a significantly smaller factor than recent natural gas and renewable energy cost reductions....

President Trumps efforts to roll back environmental regulations will not materially
improve economic conditions in Americas coal communities. As such, the paper concludes with recommendations
for steps that the federal government can take to safeguard the pension and health security of current and retired
miners and dependents and support economic diversification. Attracting new sources of economic activity and job creation will not be easy, and even at its most successful will not return coal country to peak levels of past prosperity. But responsible policymakers should be honest about whats going on in the US coal sectorincluding the causes of coals decline and unlikeliness of its resurgencerather than offer false hope that the glory days can be revived.

<TEXT> The goal of these terror attacks is to make integration of Muslims into predominantly non-Muslim societies impossible.  Shutting down open societies to protect against this kind of attack would kill freedom and the rule of law, without guaranteeing security.  The danger is that demonizing whole sections of the population appears to be a "strong" response, and that feels better than living with constant uncertainty, and the need to reach people who we don't know, don't understand, and whose presence seems to make our life more complicated.  But that's what free society demands. </TEXT>

Our primary outcome measure was catastrophic health expenditure risk, defined as any charges =40% of annual postsubsistence income...

Over 7 in 10 uninsured patients admitted for trauma are at risk of catastrophic health expenditures.

Only a system providing universal coverage -- Medicare for All -- would cure Catastrophic Health Expenditure.  Or we can entirely avoid acknowledging the risk, and say: "It Can't Happen to Me"

<TEXT> Climate change is a major disruptor that has revved up global chaos, especially in the Middle East and East Africa. Unless we stop hiding from this reality, it will inexorably overwhelm us.  Americans and the other developed nations who benefited from fossil-fuel driven development must respond to this challenge.

Syrian refugees are the lead wave of the coming tide of climate refugees.  Climate change and the loss of habitability in the Middle East is a primary cause for states to fail, descending into conflict, and an independent force pushing refugees to flee the region.

Climate change will, in this century, create hundreds of millions of refugees who will be dispossessed both directly and covertly. 

A global response will require retooling the developed world.  It is this century's alternative to war economy, except it doesn't waste resources -- it saves them.

How can this necessary direction become politically feasible?  That will require a recognition of the bankruptcy of old metrics of success and systems of incentives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing will be learned from disasters like this one. Bomb = Strong.  It doesn't matter who gets killed.  Trump says he lets the military decide what to do.  But, that creates a bias in favor of slaughter. if you're a commander in the field, holding back until you know what you're doing will not be rewarded, because the only measure that counts is to show Strength.  Caution will not be rewarded by the higher-ups.  And our local allies also lose control of their own cause.  They face the same pressure to identify targets.  The same thing happened in Vietnam, both before and after "Vietnamization" of the war.  We won all the body count metrics in Vietnam, and lost the war.  The real lesson to be learned from this in that counting on American power to win your battle is a big mistake.  You lose credibility as defenders of your own people, and you'll never be able to achieve legitimacy, because you're seen as a puppet working for foreign killers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump is boasting about a $1 trillion, job-creating infrastructure plan, which he says Democrats will have to support. Capitol Hill Republicans say it could be financed through a tax on overseas profits that U.S. companies have stashed abroad to avoid the 35-percent federal corporate tax rate.

The total is about $2.5 trillion, so a 10 percent tax, which is higher than Republicans advocate, would raise $250 billion, still just a fraction of what Trump wants to spend on roads, bridges and airports. Republican plans to finance the rest privately, through tax credits and other incentives, is a losing proposition for most infrastructure experts, who say it wont produce much, and for Democrats who dont like the politics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mr. Pruitt has a long history of championing legal efforts to undermine major environmental rules. As Oklahomas attorney general, he sued the E.P.A. 14 times in efforts to undo regulations. He believes in stripping power away from the federal government and returning it to states.

But during his Senate confirmation hearing, he told senators that despite that, he was likely to draw the line at trying to overturn the endangerment finding.

It is there, and it needs to be enforced and respected, Mr. Pruitt said. There is nothing that I know that would cause it to be reviewed.

At the end of the tunnel-vision of climate change denial, is the light of The Endangerment Finding -- a court-confirmed scientifically-based finding asserting the reality of climate change, and the necessity to address its impact, under the Clean Air Act.
All we need is acknowledgement that there is a knowable, real world.  Then acts have consequences, and the actors bear responsibility.  Humpty Dumpty is not safe behind his wall of denial.  There is no body of material evidence to support climate-denial fantasy. Like any bad dream, we see there's no there there. Out-of-control, the dream crashes, and we wake up.  Alternative Reality can't be put back together again.  But, once we see that we're stuck with climate change, and many other realities, we can begin to pick up the pieces.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Commuters have recently received a preview of how traveling between the two states could become a nightmare if the current tunnel is closed for emergency repairs. Last month, an Amtrak train derailed near the tunnel, closing half of Pennsylvania Stations tracks and leading to widespread train cancellations and delays. Then on Monday, a New Jersey Transit train derailed in the same area, setting off another round of delays.

Without this project and this tunnel, that becomes the day-to-day existence for commuters, and I dont think anybody wants that to happen, said Carlo A. Scissura, the president of the New York Building Congress, a group that represents the citys construction industry.

<TEXT> National Fuel's plan to construct the Northern Access Pipeline has been rejected by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

The DEC announced Saturday afternoon that, following a review, the agency has denied water quality certificates needed for the project which would have resulted in the construction of a 97-mile pipeline capable of carrying natural gas from Pennsylvania through Western New York. 

The decision follows three public hearings in which the DEC fielded 5,700 comments. The agency said it based its decision on the project's "failure to avoid adverse impacts to wetlands, streams, and fish and other wildlife habitat."
...

Late last month, area protesters took their fight to Albany, assembling in front of DEC headquarters to call for an end to the controversial $455 million project. Protesters also took their message to the state Capital building, where they attempted to inform onlookers about the potential dangers the pipeline could pose to those living near it. They also delivered copies of a letter that was signed by more than 140 organizations, businesses and faith communities that want to see the DEC and Gov. Andrew Cuomo deny the permits the project needs to break ground. 

Denial of permits by the DEC effectively kills the project, however similar decisions made by the agency have been challenged in court in the past.

One recent example is the Constitution Pipeline, which was designed to carry Marcellus Shale gas produced in Northeast Pennsylvania to Schoharie, N.Y. The project partners filed a lawsuit after the DEC denied a joint application for water quality certification permits. A federal court recently dismissed the partners' case challenging the state's permitting requirements.  </TEXT>

"If President Assad is indeed guilty of this horrible chemical attack on innocent civilians, I will be the first to call for his prosecution and execution by the International Criminal Court." she said. 

"However, because of our attack on Syria, this investigation may now not even be possible. And without such evidence, a successful prosecution will be much harder," </TEXT>

<TEXT> Safe zones are a good idea if there is agreement by the major players to let it happen.  Nothing is safe from asymmetric warfare by terrorists like ISIS.  So is such a deal possible?  Assad's crossing-the-line chemical warfare attack was an attempt to break up any entente between Russia and the United States that could eventually leave him as a redundant player.  Russia would be happy enough with its Mediterranean presence in western Syria, and a regional regime run by a Russian-oriented Syrian military establishment.  For that to work,    a centralized Syria must be replaced by Bosnian style regions loosely connected to a national state.  The attack by Assad is an attempt to prevent that kind of resolution from evolving.  Closing down peaceful options has been Assad's game since Day One.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Trump administration and the UAE appear to share a similar preoccupation with Iran. Current and former officials said that Trump advisers were focused throughout the transition period on exploring ways to get Moscow to break ranks with Tehran.

...

Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said he also had discussions with people close to the Trump administration about the prospects of drawing Russia away from Iran. When I would hear this, I would think, Yeah thats great for you guys, but why would Putin ever do that?  McFaul said. There is no interest in Russia ever doing that. They have a long relationship with Iran. Theyre allied with Iran in fighting in Syria. They sell weapons to Iran. Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the Middle East.

It's easy to make a deal when you don't understand what's involved.  Russia has as much chance getting Iranian influence out of Syria as the United States has of getting Iranian influence out of Iraq.  The Saudis and Emirates can't win hearts and minds.  Their answer to Mideast turmoil has been to fund Al Qaeda and Isis against the Shia. Trump is well on his way to becoming a useful idiot fighting for the dead end goals of the Saudis and the UAE. Courting Russia is just part of this misguided mission. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comparing the Candidates on Twitter in Michigan. Table 1 reveals that 138,686 tweets were posted in Michigan about politics and the election. This table shows that the overall volume of tweets using pro-Trump hashtags (56.7 percent), was much greater than the volume of tweets containing only hashtags associated with the Clinton campaign (20.3 percent). The overall volume of tweets using neutral election-related hashtags (13.4 percent) was also significantly lower compared with those using pro- Trump hashtags.
...

In previous memos we attempted to catalogue the users with high levels of automation behind their accounts, but for this state-specific sub- sample no accounts generated more than our usual threshold for identifying automation. A close look revealed that only 2% of the platforms used to send Twitter traffic were known sources of botsthe rest were platforms that either supported human users or offered very human-like levels of automation.

It looks like Trump supporters were just more engaged, by a wide margin, in Michigan.  The posting of dubious content news about Hillary appears to be more demand-driven (i.e., hunger for ammunition to attack her) than due to force-feeding by Fake News pushers.  </TEXT>

The journal [New Politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Politics_(magazine) continues to represent this point of view.  Putin's Russia is not our friend (even if RT gives good people with serious critiques of neoliberalism air time). Neither are establishment Democrats, even if they decry Putin's authoritarianism.  And we certainly can't rely on the neoliberal and neoconservative establishments to defend civil liberties, due process, and economic justice against Trump. Yes, each of the repulsive hierarchies who rule the world would like to ally themselves with our critique of their opponents.  But we should not do them the courtesy of pulling our punches, and acting as if any of them is a good-faith defender of our rights and aspirations. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The theme of this years Peoples Summit is moving beyond the resistance and the protests.

Going beyond "resistance" must mean making contact with those people who supported Trump who are now discovering that their trust was misplaced.  What is true is that no one was listening while life has gotten harder and harder for working people.  If Clinton had been elected there would have been no compelling need to face this difficult reality.  Now we've plunged into a crisis, and old-style governance can't get us back out. America can't live off the credit card provided by the Almighty Dollar.  It doesn't have the power to force its will. Trump's bluff and bluster won't change that.  We need to live within our means, and can't afford to waste resources.  Fighting against each other -- white, black, immigrant -- is a bad gamble.  It's a game in which only the casino owners win. </TEXT>

<TEXT> More Trumped up bluff and bluster.  Sessions claims that "sanctuary cities" will lose funding from the Dept. of Justice if they refuse to hand over alien felons for deportation.  This is a non-issue.  Dangerous felons should, of course, not walk the streets to commit more crimes -- whether they are aliens or citizens.  From the perspective of protecting Americans from criminals, the simple answer is to put convicted criminals into prison.  If they are not citizens, they are subject to deportation after they have served their sentence.  But we are actually safer if they are in the U.S. prison system rather than if they are deported right away and set free in their home countries.  In fact, it's an incentive for criminals to claim that they are not citizens -- get deported and walk free -- a Get Out of Jail Free card.  And then, perhaps, come back.    </TEXT>

There were crimes committed by Jews for the sake of survival.  I understand why they happened.

<TEXT> My grandmother heard what she wanted from a leader who promised simple answers to complicated questions. She chose not to hear and see the monstrous sum those answers added up to. And she lived the rest of her life with the knowledge of her indefensible complicity.

The attractive vision offered by demagogues like Hitler is never about the hard work of solving real problems with other people.  It is about treating other people as excludable enemies.  Demagogues offer fear, and nostalgia for a glorious past, threatened by malevolent others. The cherished identity is mythic  pure and simple, powerful, without a doubt.Its unity requires enemies. Its paranoia engenders its belligerence. It needs conflict and finds war, at home and abroad.  Standing up against this is dangerous.  It means getting cast as aiding the enemy.  But people do have the power to resist.  Normal people in the countries occupied by Germany joined the Resistance  risking (and often losing) their lives.  What gives people the courage to resist is as important to understand as understanding why people become accomplices to barbarism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> EPA's rule-making process will take time to undo.  But Trump and Pruitt's malevolent destructive will is apparent.  What will come quickly is stopping rational planning for the future.  According to this article. Trump

is also expected to order White House economists to revisit an Obama-era budgeting metric known as the social cost of carbon. Economists and policy makers used the metric to place a dollar cost on the economic impact of planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution: about $36 per ton. That measure formed the Obama administrations economic justification for issuing climate change regulations that would harm some industries, such as coal mining, noting that those costs would be outweighed by the economic benefits of preventing billions of tons of planet-warming pollution.

Eliminating or lowering the social cost of carbon could provide the Trump administration the economic justification for putting forth less-stringent regulations.

The draft order would also rescind an executive order by Mr. Obama that all federal agencies take climate change into account when considering any form of environmental permitting.

$36 per ton of carbon emissions was already a low estimate of the present value of the future damage that will be caused by carbon emissions.  Deliberately blinding itself to the consequences of climate change puts an end to rational planning by the U.S. government.

The appropriate response to Trump is planning ahead. What would a sane society invest in for its survival and general well-being? Everyone agrees we need to modernize and upgrade our infrastructure. But, if don't recognize that climate change matters (both to forestall the most severe impacts, and to adapt to the climate change we cannot stop) our investments will be wasted and our needs unmet. Heed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: [The entire portfolio of USACE Civil Works water resources infrastructure and programs, existing and proposed, could be affected by climate change and adaptation to climate change. This affects design and operational assumptions about resource supplies, system demands or performance requirements, and operational constraints. Both droughts and floods can affect the operations of these projects. Numerous regulatory decisions made by USACE will need to be informed by climate change impacts and adaptation considerations throughout the U.S., especially in western states.](http://www.corpsclimate.us/index.cfm)  (I believe that page has not yet been flushed down the memory hole) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the architecture of containment works (without leaching too much water into the water table), then using an abandoned coal mine as the lower reservoir for pumped hydro energy storage would address a critical barrier to renewable energy -- overcoming the resistance to change of coal miners.  By providing a source of employment at their  home base, the real agenda of these folk would be addressed: to keep their families and communities intact in the face of technological change.  This, of course, is just a place marker -- an anchor showing a commitment to people and place.  Social engineering when it is democratic and consensual is not some elitist imposition.  It is as important as every other kind of engineering in making a livable world. </TEXT>

That would normally be the job of the municipal police. But the police, themselves, are a provocative force in many communities, and would be seen by the community as an extension of the intrusion by the haters. The better defense against provocateurs comes from community-based parade marshalls who would respond in a disciplined way to de-escalate violence.

<TEXT> "An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination," the court said in a statement.

However it ruled that the company must have a policy that bars religious signals and requires employees to "dress neutrally".

The danger to the "undertaking" is ANY freedom of expression.  It is not only Muslim women whose liberty is threatened.  Suppressing rather than celebrating diversity is the sure sign of a society that is closing down -- afraid of the threat posed by freedom.  The requirement to "dress neutrally" expresses intolerance for "otherness".  Defining what is forbidden -- i.e., outside the boundaries of "neutrality" -- is the definition of what "discrimination" means in practice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Affordable Care Act revision would reduce insured numbers by 24 million, CBO projects](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/obamacare-revision-would-reduce-insured-numbers-by-24-million/2017/03/13/ea4c860a-0829-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html)

The analysis predicts that the number of people without health coverage would rise to 52 million by 2026, compared with 28 million if the Affordable Care Act remains intact. That erosion would mean that about 1 in 5 U.S. residents would be uninsured by 2026  compared to 1 in 10 uninsured now and 1 in 6 who were uninsured before the Affordable Care Act was enacted...

While the deficit would be lower, the legislation also would reduce federal revenue by $592 billion by 2026 by repealing several taxes that the Affordable Care Act created to help pay for more people to get insurance  notably taxes on high-income Americans, hospitals and health insurers...

If the GOP plan is enacted, a 21-year-old making $68,200 would pay an average of $1,450 for a years worth of insurance premiums after the new tax credits, compared with $5,100 under the current law.

On the other hand, the cost of a years worth of premiums would stay about the same for a 64-year-old at the same income level. For a 64-year-old making $26,500, the cost would rise sharply, from $1,700 to $14,600.

Now I understand how the GOP plan will improve America's health.  Uninsured people die more quickly.  Kick sick old people out of the healthcare system, and the average surviving population will be healthier, and cheaper to insure.  Trumpcare motto: Survival of the Fittest! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The researchers examined six industries that account for 80 percent of private employment in the United States. In each one, they discovered a remarkably consistent upward trend in concentration. In manufacturing, for instance, the top four companies controlled 43 percent of sales in 2012, up from 38 percent in 1982. In finance, the figure grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, and in retail trade it went to 30 percent, from 15 percent.

The faster concentration grew, the bigger the drop in labors share.

<TEXT> This is from faith leaders of Nashville and middle-Tennessee.
It's important to recognize when laws don't work -- like Prohibition, and drug criminalization.  Bad laws need to be changed, but even before laws change, we need to minimize harm.  Jails and deportations will not succeed in holding back people for long.  A self-confident America once welcomed immigrants, successfully overcoming fears to build a great and diverse people.  Over the generations our identity evolves, but slowly.  Immigrants give their children to this country, and those children become us -- who we are.  Reverting to previous American identities would be turning against ourselves.  It is a fear-driven Un-American vision.  If that vision wins, whoever is left to live in that bitter country will be the poorer in every way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In January, the Obama administration changed the rules governing how the National Security Agency may share raw surveillance it intercepts abroad, where the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does not apply and the agency may vacuum up private communications in bulk. Previously, only analysts at the agency were permitted to search through the raw trove of this information, applying minimization rules to information about Americans before sharing anything more widely in the government. Now, analysts from the other 16 intelligence agencies  including the F.B.I.  can sift through certain streams of raw intercepts themselves, applying minimization rules afterward.

Trump's loutish outbursts turn complex issues into black/white conflicts. The steady accretion of power of the National Security State should not be forgotten in the tumult of another Trumplosion. The greatest danger is selective prosecution, or weaponized disclosure by leaks. The Russians are no greater enemy of democratic governance than the Deep State. The enemy of my enemy may be just as dangerous. </TEXT>

If Trump Tower was surveilled it could well have been the work of a friendly intelligence agency -- not the U.S. government itself. Surveillance is one-way transparency. It is a tool of control. Secrecy is also a tool of control. We must ask the question: who does any violation of privacy benefit? A one-sided leak is always a manipulation, part of an attack. We should be aware of the agenda of the source of information. It does not prevent us from evaluating what the leaked story tells us. But we shouldn't be stampeded by the story.

Pressed on that point, Marshall shrugged.

Just, like, homeless people.  I think just morally, spiritually, socially, [some people] just dont want health care, he said. The Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card, as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising. And Im not judging, Im just saying socially thats where they are. So theres a group of people that even with unlimited access to health care are only going to use the emergency room when their arm is chopped off or when their pneumonia is so bad they get brought [into] the ER. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Romulo Avelica-Gonzalez was arrested and will be deported.  His daughter, Fatima Avelica, used her phone to record the agents taking him into custody. Avelica-Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico and has lived in the United States for over 25 years.  What are the crimes that warrant tearing this man away from his children?

Avelica-Gonzalez was convicted of misdemeanor DUI and misdemeanor driving without a license in 2008. Another misdemeanor conviction, in 1998, was for receipt of stolen property when he bought a non-DMV-issued vehicle registration tag. 

These are either "crimes" that are made necessary by living without legal status, or, in the case of DUI, a crime for which deportation is a ridiculous response.  It is an excuse to deport, not a reason.

Yeah, The Law Is The Law.  But that's not what's actually happening here.  Romulo harmed nobody.  His arrest is a terror tactic to send a message.  Not so much to undocumented immigrants.  They will live in greater fear, and be subject to greater exploitation because of their increased vulnerability.  But they will stay.  There are too many of them to deport.  Consider the cost of deporting this one man, and multiply that by 11 million. The goal of the new deportation tactic is to satisfy Trump's white base that their anger now has force, and is government policy.  But this does nothing to solve any real problem that Trump supporters face in life.  The question is, will they ever notice that their anger has been directed against the wrong target? Immigrants and minorities may be easier to attack than the controlling 1%.  But if you win White Purity, what have you got?  A Police State looking for another enemy of the people to lock up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [COMMENT FROM PNHP](http://www.pnhp.org/news/2017/february/unitedhealths-gaming-of-medicare-is-now-in-court)

Private Medicare Advantage plans have gamed the system at the expense of taxpayers by surreptitiously selectively enrolling healthier, less costly patients, and then, when risk adjustment was introduced to correct for this favorable selection, the plans upcoded to qualify for higher payments by making the patients appear sicker than they really were.  Finally, the legal system has caught up with them. First a whistleblower suit was filed under the False Claims Act, and now,  the Justice Department has joined in that action....

Whether or not there is a technical violation of the regulations, it is the insertion of a rent-seeking intermediary that is the fundamental flaw here. Gaming favorable selection and risk adjustment does not occur in the traditional Medicare program. Gaming the system is expensive because it requires more administrative efforts to pull it off. The private plans have about five times the administrative costs of the traditional Medicare program, and we taxpayers are footing the bill....

Obviously the insurers violated what should have been the intent of the laws and regulations. But they will always do that if it accrues to their benefit. The solution is simple: throw them out, fix Medicare, and then expand it to include all of us. An immediate benefit is that it would also end discussion of all of the flawed policies being considered under repeal and replace. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There could not be better evidence that the Republicans never did have an effective plan to replace the Affordable Care Act than the fact that they are now advancing legislation to protect the private insurers in the ACA exchanges - reinforcing them rather than shutting them down.

So their strategy has changed from repeal and replace, and then to repeal and repair, and now simply to repair - repair that will protect the private insurers.

Changing market rules to promote bare-bones private plans is the Republican version of providing access, but that would make actual health care truly unaffordable for a majority of Americans with significant medical needs because the very high out-of-pocket expenses would be beyond the capabilities of most American family budgets.

It appears that all of the Republican replace proposals would leave millions worse off. The replace that people want is affordable health care, but not merely a continuation of the inadequate policies of the Affordable Care Act. What they really want, though some do not realize it, is an equitably funded, universal health insurance program - an improved Medicare for all. That would give all of us affordable access to health care, and not just access to nearly worthless private health plans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the waning days of the Obama administration, James R. Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence, and John Brennan, the CIA director at the time, shared Yatess concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White House. They feared that Flynn had put himself in a compromising position and thought that Pence had a right to know that he had been misled, according to one of the officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

A senior Trump administration official said that the White House was aware of the matter, adding that weve been working on this for weeks.

The current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynns communications with the Russian ambassador, they couldnt rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transition.

So Flynn has a choice: fall on his sword for the team, or point the sword at those who directed him -- Bannon? Miller? Trump? -- and make shish kebab.  What a revolting predicament! How could Flynn have suspected that his private conversation with the Russian Ambassador could be recorded by the NSA? </TEXT>

<TEXT> On Tuesday, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology is expected to hold a hearing on a bill to undermine health regulations that is based on a strategy cooked up by tobacco industry strategists more than two decades ago. At what Republicans on the committee have dubbed the Making EPA Great Again hearing, lawmakers are likely to discuss the Secret Science Reform Act, a bill that would limit the EPA to using only data that can be replicated or made available for independent analysis.

The proposal may sound reasonable enough at first. But because health research often contains confidential personal information that is illegal to share, the bill would prevent the EPA from using many of the best scientific studies. It would also prohibit using studies of one-time events, such as the Gulf oil spill or the effect of a partial ban of chlorpyrifos on children, which fueled the EPAs decision to eliminate all agricultural uses of the pesticide, because these events  and thus the studies of them  cant be repeated. Although it is nominally about transparency, the bill leaves intact protections that allow industry to keep much of its own inner workings and skewed research secret from the public, while delegitimizing studies done by researchers with no vested interest in their outcome.

<TEXT> A few blocks away from Aljasem, John Dutcher, a 61-year-old house cleaner, lives in a complex of low-rise apartments in a neighborhood where American flags flapped on porches. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Dutcher said he was one of those guys who would want to put a pigs head on a mosque. I never acted on it, but I played it in my head.

I hated Muslims, he said.

For years, Dutchers neighbors were meth addicts and rowdy alcoholics. Slobs. In June, a Syrian family who spoke no English moved in. Another family moved in after that, then another. Now there are six.

Soon enough, Dutcher said, empty bottles in the hallway were replaced with childrens bicycles. The loud arguments of a drug-addicted couple were replaced by the sounds of childrens laughter.

The Muslims here were all about family and they just loved everyone, Dutcher said. I remember the people who lived here before; they took for granted everything this country gave them. These people, they really changed my heart.

And what about the despair of the Trump-loving meth addicts who were displaced by God-fearing family-loving Syrian refugees?  Their lives also matter.  Beyond right-wing populist nativism and liberal moral superiority there is a gap in the discussion.  Bernie Sanders got the direction right, but didn't show he could do what was necessary: provide enough hope for the future to those in America who live in despair -- enough confidence in the future so that their moral sights are raised, and they can imagine being members of a common humanity, who can afford to offer a helping hand to others in greater need then themselves.  Unless America's growing basket of discarded are re-knit back into the fabric of society, the future will be behind walls and behind prison bars.

<TEXT> The difference between Bannon/Trump and politicians like McConnell is that Bannon/Trump disdains hypocrisy.  The game is Winner Takes All.  Bannon/Trump  believes that Killers Win, so it's vital to break from the politically correct stance that says that the USA is morally superior to Putin's Russia.  McConnell doesn't understand Bannon/Trump's game plan to Win.  That requires the world to be intimidated by the threat of naked aggression by the USA, and, accordingly, to submit to American power.  But before the world submits, Bannon/Trump must bring Americans under heel.  There is no better model for Bannon/Trump than the calculating cold-hearted killer Putin.  McConnell is caught out, in a unique act of courage, defending hypocrisy.  McConnell, you are on notice. Stay in your corrupt shell, and don't raise your head again.          </TEXT>

The point of a political speech is to persuade people of what we think right.](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels) -- Joseph Goebbels </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spoiler: It is not a myth.  But skeptics, who really tried to poke holes in the underlying study, cast doubt by saying that you should reduce the estimate of agreement from 97% to 91%.  The original study has been updated:[Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002) and sets the range of consensus:

The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming ('no position') represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue is not whether Bannon needs Senate confirmation, but whether this President can hand over control of the flow of vital security information and analysis to Steve Bannon.  Bannon has an agenda: to manufacture enemies in order to restrict the human rights and civil liberties which are the foundations of American identity.  His goal is an America dominated by Right Wing political correctness: male, white, and Christian.  The Senate Committee on Homeland Security is now taking calls on Bannon's appointment to National Security Council.  The Southern Poverty Law Center reported that the Committee is tallying calls and emails.  The NSC is the most important security body in the White House, and no political operative - especially not this one - should have so much sway over the most important decisions effecting our domestic security and military policy.   Main Number: 202-224-4751   Call and express your opposition to Bannon's appointment to the NSC.   </TEXT>

President Trumps executive order banning immigrants from some Muslim countries sent shock waves through the tech industry over the weekend because it was a loud and clear message to the world that Americas doors are now closed, and xenophobia and bigotry are the new rules of law.

<TEXT> This is a terrific piece.  Ive been disappointed with most discussions of NAFTA (and on other trade agreements like TPP) from the left.  The critique made by Bernie Sanders is not clearly distinct from the economic nationalism of Trump.  Lori Wallach, Maude  Barlow, and Dean Baker make important points, but miss the essential role of workers as the counterweight to corporatist globalization.   

Changing the direction of the race   not to the bottom, but, rather, towards a rising vision for the future  is the fight worth waging.  I believe that the need to deal with climate change and resource constraints requires a focus on the real economy, and away from financialization.  It means lowering environmental impacts.  We have neither time nor resources to waste.  That means focusing on public goods to meet a greater share of human needs.  That can be the programmatic basis for a transnational working class alternative for globalization.  

Is that possible?  I dont know.  Workers struggles for the right to defend themselves is the place to start.  Solidarity across borders is required if any of those struggles is to succeed.  This piece gives me hope.

<TEXT> Organizations including the AFT Union and New York Taxi Workers Alliance publicly announced their support for the protest.

"Our 19,000-member-strong union stands firmly opposed to Donald Trump's Muslim ban. As an organization whose membership is largely Muslim, a workforce that's almost universally immigrant, and a working-class movement that is rooted in the defense of the oppressed, we say no to this inhumane and unconstitutional ban," the NYTWA said in a statement.

"We stand in solidarity with all protesting at JFK #Terminal4   airports across the country. We are a country of immigrants, we stand together," AFT union wrote on Twitter.

The New York Taxi Workers Alliance also joined the protests, leaving Terminal 4 pick-up lines empty.

"We cannot be silent. We go to work to welcome people to a land that once welcomed us, we will not be divided," a tweet from the NYTWA read Saturday evening.

<TEXT> The history of the U.S. refugee program demonstrates that the lengthy and extensive vetting that all refugees must undergo is an effective deterrent for terrorists. Recent research finds that the chance of being killed by a refugee-perpetrated terror attack was [1 in 3.64 billion per year](https://www.cato.org/blog/terrorism-risk-asylum-seekers-refugees-minnesota-new-york-new-jersey-terrorist-attacks

<TEXT> According to the index, median income actually declined by 2.4 percent between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available, which may help explain the shifting political winds.

Its our response to how capitalism has failed us  and how we need to fix it, said Adrian Monck, a member of the forums executive committee.

The United States ranked 23rd out of 30 advanced economies. In terms of wage and nonwage compensation, it ranked last; in social protection, it came in 25th. It also came in 25th on intermediation of business investment  in other words, the amount of money that goes into productive investments, such as research and development and infrastructure as opposed to share buybacks. (Norway ranked No. 1. Living standards there rose by 10.6 percent from 2008 to 2013 while the economy grew only 0.5 percent.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> In picturing the situation the new administration will encounter this January, John McDonough, PhD, MPA, professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Policy in Boston, compared it to a scene from the original "Ghostbusters" movie.
In it, a lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency is about to burst open a storage facility containing all the mischievous and malevolent spirits the heroes have rounded up.
"You really don't want to do this. You don't know what's going to happen," McDonough said. "And quite literally all hell breaks loose," he said.
...
While the GOP has enough votes on its own to partially repeal the law through the budget reconciliation process, which cannot be filibustered, to pass a replacement bill they will need at least eight Democratic votes in the Senate.
...
There is one thing that both liberals and conservatives can likely agree on and that is how high the stakes are for Republicans. With a majority in both chambers and a Republican president, Wallner said, "There are no more excuses."

<TEXT> lawyers pointed out that ICE, the federal agent of deportation, receives fingerprints and identifying information for every New York City arrest, whether the city has asked about immigration status or not.

As a result, arrests for being in the park after dark, for possessing an open container of alcohol, or for other harmless activities, which are largely permitted in more affluent neighborhoods, essentially flag vulnerable New Yorkers for priority enforcement by ICE, the lawyers wrote.

The lawyers said police should issue civil summonses instead of criminal violations whenever possible, a conclusion Mark-Viverito agreed with in a statement from her spokeswoman.

Issuing more civil, instead of criminal, summonses will significantly reduce unnecessary interactions with the criminal-justice system and will help thwart ICE's attempts to target immigrant New Yorkers, the spokeswoman said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People Power was crucial in stopping the DAPL disaster from happening.  Profits (called "jobs" or "economic development") will win every time if people are not mobilized to defend their own interests, and the public good.  But mass mobilizations are not enough.  You need strong reasons that other people recognize as just -- like preventing the contamination of the Missouri River for millions of people -- and you need a government that has the will to defend the public interest over private profit.  

We may have lost that third crucial ingredient  when the Trump administration takes over.  But people eventually notice when their government fails to listen.  It may take a while, but the struggle for justice cannot by silenced.  Its message is: We're under attack today, but tomorrow it may be you.  So let us hang together, or we will all hang separately.  

Those who think they can benefit from a government that is not just will learn that they have been suckers.  The principle of Might Makes Right only works if you are supremely powerful.  Everyone else is a loser -- if not today, tomorrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Note that Shapiro published this on his web site in February 2016.
During the current Presidential campaign in 2016, a lot of journalists and commentators keep pointing out again and again that Trump is a liar, etc. That may all be true, but it doesnt make a dent in the number of  his supporters.

This reminds me of Jean Baudrillards comments throughout his work (for example, in Fatal Strategies) on the difference between critical theory discourse and what Baudrillard called fatal theory: in other words, the ineffectiveness of critical theory discourse. Since Trump is the candidate of Reality TV (what Baudrillard in his last works called Telemorphosis), of the celebrity culture, of media hyper-reality entertainment, in other words simulation invoking the truth against him doesnt work as a strategy! (we are in hyper-reality where, in a sense, there is no more truth)

Because Trump is already more advanced than the discourse of truth. The only way to bring him down would be to, in some way, out-Trump Trump. More hyper-real than the hyper-real. More simulation than simulation. That is our motto. (to paraphrase Tyrell in Blade Runner) </TEXT>

Even if he hasn't committed an impeachable offense, Amendment 25 of the Constitution provides an escape hatch if the President is physically or mentally incapable of performing his duties.

Section 4 of the Amendment allows for involuntary transfers of power. If the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or some other body created by Congress to act in place of the Cabinet) inform Congress that the President is unable to exercise the powers of his office, those powers pass to the Vice President who functions as Acting President. When the President indicates that he wishes those powers returned, he need only inform Congress of this fact and the powers are returned. If the Vice President and Cabinet challenge the President, Congress must decide the matter within a maximum of twenty-three days. A two-thirds vote in each house is needed for the Vice President to prevail.

Dr. Lawrence C. Mohr, White House Physician from 1987 to 1993, has suggested that: 
 The presence of a major psychotic disorder in which a president is clearly out of touch with reality would certainly be a reason to initiate the process of presidential disability.  the extent of impairment should be assessed on the basis of adverse effects on alertness, cognitive function, judgment, appropriate behavior, the ability to choose among options and the ability to communicate clearly. If any of these are impaired, it is my opinion that the powers of the president should be transferred to the vice president until the impairment resolves.

<TEXT> It is not just property owners, buyers and sellers who are struggling to estimate the potential financial impact of climate change on the real estate market. These risks compound as individual mortgages get bundled and sold as securities. In his April report, Mr. Becketti, the Freddie Mac economist, emphasized how difficult it was to predict whether the bubble in coastal real estate would slowly deflate or suddenly pop.

Will the value of the house decline gradually as the expected life of the house becomes shorter? he wrote. Or, alternatively, will the value of the house  and all the houses around it  plunge the first time a lender refuses to make a mortgage on a nearby house or an insurer refuses to issue a homeowners policy?

...
Coastal mortgages are growing into as big a bubble as the housing market of 2007, said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami. But this time, he said, there will not be a rebound because the waters will not recede and properties will eventually lose all of their value.

<TEXT> The Michigan law pushed by Ms. DeVos to establish charter schools 20 years ago allows an unusually large number of organizations to start such schools, yet established little mechanism for oversight. Even Republican supporters of charter schools say the law has allowed failing charter schools to expand or replicate.

Last spring, the DeVos-backed group was the chief force behind the defeat of legislation that would have established standards for identifying and closing failing schools, both charter and public, in Detroit, where a flood of charter schools in the past decade has created what even charter school supporters call chaos. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The present energy economy in the US is driven by the low price of natural gas and renewables, and Trump is unlikely to be able to change that. The subsidies that are currently helping renewables were popular enough in Congress to be one of the few things passed during the Obama administration, and the trajectory of renewable prices is such that the subsidies won't be needed for cost competitiveness for much longer. While Trump may revoke some of the rules that make coal less competitive, it's not clear that businesses will feel confident enough that these changes will survive long enough to make something like a coal plant, with a lifespan that runs decades, a reasonable risk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The essential problem is the profit-making insurance model for covering the cost of health care. 

Illness is not an accident. It is a part of life. The high fixed cost of providing a healthcare system, starting with the education of medical professionals, makes the system resemble the economic structure of a public utility rather than a competitive commodity. The competitive insurance model has failed. It is time to transition to a public service model with universal coverage, like fire and police. No one (not even the top .01%) is wealthy enough to have modern healthcare once the system has fallen apart, due to cutthroat competition. Reality must trump ideology.

Bottom Line: It's not profitable to insure people with a high risk of being sick. In fact, the whole "health insurance" game is sick. Insurance companies' profits depend on screening out people who need healthcare, and patients hold off spending on healthcare coverage until they know they'll need it. Who's fooling whom? Everyone. It's time to change the game to one that makes sense. Healthcare systems have high fixed cost. They need the broadest market base to cover those costs. Services should be provided based on medical need, not income -- something like fire protection services, or water supply, or highway repair, or some other public utility. It could be privately run, and highly regulated. Or it could be run by a government. But it can't be run as a commodity market.

This is why the private insurance model doesn't work. ACA helped expand coverage. But now the sick chickens have come home to roost -- getting care they previously couldn't afford -- and their lives are not profitable to insure. So private insurers are getting out, or jacking up rates. Leaving us with a problem: EITHER throw the sick ones overboard (unless they have the cash to pay their own bills) -- i.e., repeal ACA for Republican "consumer-driven" private health care, OR recognize that we've kicked the can down the road to a dead end, and have to replace the private insurance model with tax-financed health care for all, where we're all in, and the healthy pay up front to cover the current sick, knowing that they will be covered when their turn comes. That's civilized -- a quaint concept, don't you think?

The market alternative to a Single Payer healthcare system turns out to be massive mergers and downsizing in the healthcare industry. This is leading to a private Single Provider system, whose sole objective is profit maximization.  I, for one, am not comfortable putting my health into those Invisible Hands.

According to a recent report, www.WhenHospitalsMerge.org , the number of public short-term acute care hospitals in the U.S. dropped an astonishing 34 percent between 2001 and 2016. The number of secular nonprofit hospitals, too, shrunk by 11 percent, while for-profit systems shot up by more than 50 percent. In rural areas, where it is harder to turn a profit, these trends have left tremendous disparities in health care access. 

Clinton corporate Democrats orient towards existing power. They see their role as supplicants, negotiating out of weakness, always working within the framework of corporate rule.  The result in healthcare, ACA,  was sold as a great business plan for Big Pharma and the insurance industry. What corporate Democrats have always had to sell is their ability to assure consent of the people. They tell us not to struggle, just trust them to speak for us. Bernie Sanders opened the escape hatch.  A lot of people are no longer in the herd. Now they have to figure out how to continue to act together, finding the means as well as the will to wrest back their democratic power.  

For many, electing Donald Trump was the first step in asserting themselves  breaking free from the system of false promises.  When they find that Donald is just another false prophet, that the promised land is still beyond their grasp, will they be ready to take charge, democratically, for themselves?  Thats the direction Sanders proposed, but it wont be easy.  The way forward only works when people stay mobilized and involved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> HIAS, the global Jewish nonprofit that protects refugees, today called on President-elect Donald J. Trump to uphold the United States longstanding policy of protecting refugees.
,,,
 Welcoming and protecting refugees resonates especially deeply in the Jewish community, which remembers the plight of Jews who were turned away during World War II when they had nowhere else to go. Then, as now, governments and politicians falsely cast refugees as a threat, when they should have been sheltering them from the threats they were fleeing. No one expects to one day become a refugee. When families are suddenly forced to leave everything they know behind and flee their home country, its because they had no safe alternative." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The scandal is that Comey choked twice in the face of an insurrection by the Giuliani crew at the New York office.  First, fearing criticism of his findings, on July 5 he defensively justified his decision that no prosecution be pursued -- opening up this can of worms.  Then the friends of Giuliani in the NYC FBI office played Comey a second time, holding back information that they had -- that Weiner's laptop was shared  with Huma and had a copy of Huma's email files on it. They strategically told Comey about two weeks before the election.  Comey feared the news would be leaked to Giuliani (as it had, if Giuliani's boast to Fox News, days prior to Comey's late October announcement, can be believed).  Comey caved on Friday, October 28, announcing to Congress that evidence against Hillary might exist in these unexamined files.  Now we know that there was no there there.  But the damage has been done, as planned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> JA: Theres an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation.  Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well its just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves.

But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Woodward-Bernstein story appeared on October 10, 1972.  It apparently had no adverse impact on Nixon's re-election.
Of course the FBI, which was investigating the Watergate break-in, refused to confirm Woodward and Bernstein's story:
Asked by The Washington Post to discuss Segretti, three FBI and Justice Department officials involved in the Watergate probe refused. At the mention of Segretti's name, each said -- in the words of one -- "That's part of the Watergate investigation." One of the officials, however, became angry at the mention of Segretti's name and characterized his activities as "indescribable." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The current form of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) that exists in many bilateral trade agreements negotiated by EU governments, has been replaced with a new and improved Investment Court System. The new mechanism will be a public one and not based on ad hoc tribunals. This reform means that investors can be protected from discrimination in a narrow number of cases, but in a manner which does not leave any room for concern on the right of states to regulate in the public interest.  The procedures of the Investment Court will be transparent and its judges appointed by the EU and Canada.The Commission is committed to completing and refining the reform of investment dispute resolution and the discussions of the past few weeks and days have helped shape that commitment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Justice Dept. Strongly Discouraged Comey on Move in Clinton Email Case](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html?_r=0)
On Oct. 3, F.B.I. agents seized several electronic devices from Mr. Weiner: a laptop, his iPhone and an iPad that was in large measure used by his 4-year-old son to watch cartoons, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Days later, F.B.I. agents also confiscated a Wi-Fi router that could identify any other devices that had been used, the person said.

While searching the laptop, the agents discovered the existence of tens of thousands of emails, some of them sent between Ms. Abedin and other Clinton aides, according to senior law enforcement officials. It is not clear if Ms. Abedin downloaded the emails to the laptop or if they were automatically backed up there. The emails dated back years, the officials said. Ms. Abedin has testified that she did not routinely delete her emails. </TEXT>

Even if any of the emails are judged to be classified, that would not necessarily indicate potential legal peril for anyone involved. The FBI already found scores of emails with classified information on Clintons server, but didnt think the handling of the material rose to the level of a crime.

And Comey apparently doesn't even have a search warrant yet.  Trump is certain that Comey would not have intervened so close to the Presidential election unless he had evidence of a serious crime.  But prior to any search, there is no evidence.  Only an FBI Director who cracked under pressure.  The "lock her up" crowd wanted blood from somewhere.  Now Comey is their hero. </TEXT>

Given the lack of a survivable alternative, Hillary will be elected.  But those who see what is happening now know that there is no firewall between the inner circle and broadcasting to the world.  At least some will consider their own futures, and rather than cover for shameful conduct, they will resign and talk.  That is Wikileaks' gift to democracy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The deeper problem is the profit-making insurance model for covering the cost of health care.  Illness is not an accident.  It is a part of life.  The high fixed cost of providing a healthcare system, starting with the education of medical professionals, makes the system follow the economic structure of a public utility rather than a competitive commodity.  The competitive insurance model has failed.  It is time to transition to a public service model with universal coverage, like fire and police.  No one (not even the top .01%) is wealthy enough to have modern healthcare once the system has fallen apart, due to cutthroat competition. Reality must trump ideology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Starting with Chris Wallace's question:
I want to ask you here on the stage tonight, do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely - sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?

TRUMP: I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I will look at it at the time. What I've seen - what I've seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing that the New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care. And it's so dishonest, and they've poisoned the minds of the voters. But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on Nov. 8, but I think they're gonna see through it.

Trump never definitively says anything.  He expresses himself by innuendo and insinuation, charges without backup -- never evidence, never clear statements.  Fuzzy thinkers operate on overall feelings.  They feel comfortable with "knowing what he means" and are annoyed by anyone trying to pin Trump down to a clear statement.  So in answering whether he would commit to "accept the result of this election" Trump's response is "I will look at it at the time." And his explanation appears to be that the media have "poisoned the minds of the voters".  That's where the logical steps end.  He veers off to say "I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on Nov. 8, but I think they're gonna see through it."  The implication -- but Trump never directly makes his point -- is that if the voters see through the media's poison, he will be elected, and he will, of course, accept the results.  But if their minds have been poisoned, and he loses, he would find that result to be unacceptable.  Time for a 2nd Amendment insurrection? As Trump says:  "I will keep you in suspense." </TEXT>

<TEXT> In November 2015, as Mrs. Clintons campaign was refusing to release transcripts of her paid speeches, her speechwriter, Dan Schwerin, suggested anonymously leaking to a reporter excerpts from one particular speech he wrote for her: A 2014 address to Deutsche Bank.

In that speech, he said in the email, I wrote her a long riff about economic fairness and how the financial industry has lost its way, precisely for the purpose of having something we could show people if ever asked what she was saying behind closed doors for two years to all those fat cats. He also acknowledged that it was definitely not as tough or pointed as we would write it now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> global material productivity has declined since about the year 2000 and the global economy now needs more materials per unit of GDP than it did at the turn of the century. While this may seem counter-intuitive it has been caused by a large shift of economic activity from very material-efficient economies such as Japan, the Republic of Korea and Europe to, at this time, the much less material-efficient economies of China, India and Southeast Asia. This results in overall growing environmental pressure per unit of economic activity and shows that additional effort around public policy and financing is required to improve material use efficiency substantially in the coming decades.

This is the kind of understanding that is needed to make trade policy that would work for people and the environment, rather than just heighten profits.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This discussion article lays out the territory for a real debate about immigration.  I don't agree with several main points:
1) stagnating real income in the U.S. reflects competitive pressure globally, and changing technology, not immigration.
2) the idea that the U.S. was 85% "white" until recent immigration shifted the balance is a misunderstanding of what "white" is all about.  Foreign-born residents from Europe were often seen as a threat by native-born Americans.  But they became integrated and defined as "white" America.  Left behind as outsiders -- as "nonwhite" -- are Blacks and Spanish-speaking immigrants who form a large enough group to maintain a cultural community, even though they participate as workers in the larger society.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Michael Hudson offers a powerful critique.  I  know his work from the Left Forum.  I see it reproduced in UNZ which appears to be alt-right.  Hudson points to the problem.  He doesn't discuss solutions.  That allows essentially correct analysis to be used as ammunition to propagate reactionary nationalist utopianism.  A left-green alternative would not be an easy solution.  It relies on people to choose a path away from slaughter, and a recognition that uncontrolled climate change will sink us all.  My alternative is NOT Politically Correct.  But it would give humans a fighting chance to survive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I want radical change, and I come from a different place than Trump.  One difference is that my vision doesn't allow for shortcuts.  As Eugene Victor Debs said a hundred years ago: 
[Too long have the workers of the world waited for some Moses to lead them out of bondage. I would not lead you out if I could; for if you could be led out, you could be led back again. I would have you make up your minds there is nothing that you cannot do for yourselves.](http://www.azquotes.com/author/3810-Eugene_V_Debs)

For the democratic process to be effective in bringing about change, we have to want to listen and work with each other.   It can't be a winner-takes-all world because the cost of coercing other people to play your game is too high.  I want to convince you that climate change is real, and we have to live within the real.  There are problems, but we can solve them.  Now that may sound like Hillary, but she can't deliver because she believes that existing power cannot be challenged.  And existing institutions like the banks and Wall St. hog resources we cannot afford to waste.  I live in New York, so I feel free to vote for Jill Stein.  But if I lived in a toss up state, I'd have to vote for Hillary. Stopping One Man Rule, is my first priority.  Fighting President Clinton will be hard, but at least the veneer of democratic process will remain intact.  There will be space to mobilize the movement we need. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reason democratic institutions of governance exist is because people fought for their right to self-rule.  The victory has only been partial.  The struggle continues.  Our ability to self-rule politically is subverted by concentrated power in few hands, who own and control the institutions that are needed to make actions effective.  The problem can't be simply abolished.  But it can be mitigated, with struggle. If we want to live in a society that does better for more of its people, we need to defend fair and free elections, and organize ourselves as active agents to counter the weight of institutional power (most crudely, money,  but also, leaving the heavy thinking to the experts).  Unrigging the system will not be easy.  You can cut the Gordian knot, but then everything that knot held together will fall apart unless you've built an alternative structure to keep things working.  Remember: Don't Give Up.  There's no one to surrender to.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> After the election is past, the real struggle begins.  By proclaiming that this election is "rigged", Trump is pivoting from politics within the American Constitutional system to delegitimizing elected institutions, and making the U.S. government "fair game" for popular resistance -- without the inhibition of "non-violence".  Fighting dirty is what he knows and what he teaches.  And if sections of the police and army can be split from their oaths of loyalty to defend the Constitution...  
The republic is in jeopardy.  Unfortunately, Hillary and corporate politicians are too weak to defend democratic order, because they don't have a better future to offer.  We need to re-invent a democratic future worth fighting for.  And that fight starts with ideas and political engagement that mobilizes people after the election is over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Trump Taj Mahal, a 17-acre Jersey Shore gambling hub which cost more than $1 billion to build, was a losing proposition since it opened its doors in 1990. A report from CNN this summer found that the casino started bleeding money almost immediately, before filing for bankruptcy four times.

About two weeks after the Trump Taj Mahal opened, the now-G.O.P. nominee told Larry King in an interview that his new venture was a tremendous success. In reality, according to CNN, the casinos bank account had less than zero dollars on four of the first 16 days that it had been open, amassing deficits of up to $1.7 million. Later that year, New Jersey approved a $65 million bailout for the hotel, and it filed for bankruptcy for the first time a year later.

When his daddy's support tapped out, the nanny state of New Jersey came to the rescue.  But it wasn't enough.  Bankruptcy followed bankruptcy.  But Donald, in his genius, converted each of these disasters (paid for by other people) into opportunities for himself.  And he can do the same for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive known Jeff for 15 years, Trump said. Terrific guy. Hes a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it  Jeffrey enjoys his social life....

Epstein has spent the bulk of his adult life cultivating relationships with the worlds most powerful men. Flight logs show that from 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epsteins private plane, dubbed The Lolita Express by the press, 26 times. After Epsteins arrest in July 2006, federal tax records show Epstein donated $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation that year.
Epstein was also a regular visitor to Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago, and the two were friends. According to the Daily Mail, Trump was a frequent dinner guest at Epsteins home, which was often full of barely dressed models. In 2003, New York magazine reported that Trump also attended a dinner party at Epsteins honoring Bill Clinton.
Last year, The Guardian reported that Epsteins little black book contained contact numbers for A-listers including Tony Blair, Naomi Campbell, Dustin Hoffman, Michael Bloomberg and Richard Branson.

Somehow, neither Gary Johnson nor Jill Stein were on Jeffrey's A List.

<TEXT> CNN interviewed Mitnick on air via satellite and asked him about the Trump campaigns argument that avoiding taxes meant Trump had dealt with the tax code brilliantly. Mitnick said that Trump had virtually zero role in preparing his own taxes. His only contribution was to hire Mitnick. Here, Mitnick gave a grin. He was enjoying himself. Those returns were entirely created by us, Mitnick said.

So Trump is not a tax code genius.  And he can't retaliate against Mitnick's blowing his boast because he still needs Mitnick to answer any questions from IRS auditors -- unless there really is no audit.  Then Donald would be called upon to release his tax returns, as promised -- whose contents he doesn't understand.  </TEXT>

True Followers would go down with their Leader.  
The only reason they don't get to lay whomsoever they please is because they are not Winners like the Donald.  They are Losers who follow.  They're wannabes who ape the Man who embodies their own values.

If these guys drop the cause now, it will be because they are cowards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came across this description of Coney Island in decline while looking for references to my old optometrist, Dr. Irving Herzenberg, who is interviewed for this article.  I grew up in Coney Island from birth (1942) until I left for grad school in 1962.  (I just came across an old eyeglass case with Dr. Herzenberg's imprint.)  Trump Village is just being built in 1964.  Fred Trump had already built Beach Haven, just to the north of the Belt Parkway.   My uncle and his family moved from East Flatbush to the Warbasse Houses, which were in between the Trump properties. Warbasse was also being built at the time (1964).   In retrospect, the housing shortage after World War II, and the failure to build housing that the poor could afford, led to poor people moving into substandard housing, growing conflicts, and old neighborhoods -- predominantly Jewish, but also Italian -- being displaced.  Many of those fleeing their old neighborhoods wound up in Fred Trump's new developments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The brilliant idea of not paying taxes only works as long as other people pay your share of the social burden.  Otherwise you're on your way to a failed state, where only fools pay taxes, and vital government services don't work.  That used to be the story in "less developed" countries, but not so much in the U.S.A.  But cynicism about social responsibility has corroded the moral fabric that kept the republic intact.  About 40 years we crested, and as real living standards stagnated, the bitterness that has turned us against each other set in.  The idea that total abandonment of responsibility is "smart" is a thief's ethic.  Read the damn article and you'll see why Trump knows the problem because his business model IS the problem:

Mr. Trump hasnt hesitated to castigate corporate executives and Wall Street money managers for taking advantage of tax loopholes, and has proposed eliminating the favorable treatment of their income, a tax benefit that pales in significance to the magnitude of his.

Yet Mr. Trump chose not to release his returns, and his tax proposals would not close a single loophole that benefits him. On the contrary, he would make the tax code even more favorable to real estate developers like himself. He would lower the tax rate to 15 percent for limited liability companies and partnerships, the very entities in which Mr. Trump holds most of his assets.

He hasnt proposed anything to address these loopholes, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.

At the broadest level, Mr. Trumps tax avoidance undermines the entire tax system, which rests on the foundation that every citizen pays a fair share.

Our whole system is based on voluntary compliance, Mr. Rosenthal said. How will people react when they see a self-proclaimed billionaire like Trump pays no tax? Why should they pay?

Mr. Rosenthal said it reminded him of the famous quote attributed to the hotel owner Leona Helmsley: Only the little people pay taxes. </TEXT>

One word: funding, said Janna Chernetz, New Jersey policy director for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign.

Chernetz puts NJ TRANSITs woes smack dab on Gov. Chris Christies doorstep. She said hes slashed state funds for the nations third busiest commuter system by 90 percent in 11 years.

Ordinary investors in the new company, meanwhile, saw the value of their shares plunge to 17 cents from $35.50, while scores of contractors went unpaid for work on Mr. Trumps casinos and casino bondholders received pennies on the dollar.

<TEXT> Statement of the Campaign for Peace and Democracy,
   
          We are supporters of the democratic Syrian Revolution and opponents of military intervention from the outside. We oppose all attacks on civilians in Syria, whether committed by the Assad regime and its allies, by ISIS, by other jihadist groups, or by anyone else. We support the call for the removal of all foreign fighters from Syria: the anti-regime jihadis, the U.S. special ops forces, and the Turkish army, but also the Russians, Iranians, Hezbollah, and numerous Shiite militias backing Assad. It is a humanitarian and political imperative that the horrific bloodletting in Syria be brought to an end.
         
A cease-fire deal was recently negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The cease-fire, however, has collapsed, following what Washington called its accidental strike on Syrian government soldiers and then what was most likely an intentional bombing by Russian or Syrian aircraft, or both, of an aid convey trying to get supplies to one of the many areas besieged by regime forces.
 
           But the Kerry-Lavrov arrangement was flawed from the start. It failed to address the underlying political issues of the crisis, and was therefore doomed to failure. Worse, had it been consummated, it would have meant joint bombing by the United States, Russia, and the Syrian government of many thousands of the people now being bombed by the Russians and Assad. In the name of fighting terrorists, innocent civilians and democratic rebels would have been bombed along with ISIS and other jihadists, the latter located near Free Syrian Army units -- as they are being bombed now -- but the bombing would have taken place with the seal of approval and participation of the U.S. government.
 
           As it stands, the assault by Assad and his various foreign allies on Aleppo is shaping up as a humanitarian catastrophe of the first order. The current ferocious bombardment of civilian targets there is just the beginning. On October 1, there will be a "Global Day of Rage for Allepo," with [worldwide demonstrations](https://www.facebook.com/Global-Campaign-of-Solidarity-with-the-Syrian-Revolution-147353662105485/) in solidarity with the people of Aleppo and against the sieges, the barrel-bombing and missiles, the intentional targeting of rescue and healthcare facilities and workers -- and the lies and diplomatic charades.
 
            In New York City, a demonstration will be held on Saturday, October 1, 1:00 pm, at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, 48th Street and   1st Avenue. In Chicago, demonstrators will gather at 1:00pm on Saturday at the plaza just south of the Tribune Media Building, on Michigan Avenue, at the north east end of the Dusable Bridge across the Chicago River, and in Washington DC  at the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, at noon on Saturday. Check here for other events in the U.S. and around the world.
 
            We are also writing to draw your attention to two recent statements about the Syrian crisis (included below): "An Open Letter about Syria: the Russia-US Bombing Deal Will Bring Neither Peace Nor Justice," and "Syrian Writers, Artists, and Journalists Speak Out Against US and Russian Policy," published by The Nation. Both statements are signed by individuals, not organizations.
 
In peace and solidarity,
Joanne                Tom

<TEXT> Thank God for hypocrisy -- "the tribute that vice pays to virtue" (La Rochefoucauld).  Israel is a cross that too many Jews feel they have to bear.  I am a Jew by ethnic origin.  I believe that Israel was a forced solution for Jews fleeing from continental Europe.  Everyone who had the power to stop them entering their territory did so.  The historic religious tie of Jews to Palestine made a bad alternative look good.  It might have worked if the rights and interests of Arabs had been respected.  There have always been some Jews in Israel who understood the debt that Israeli Jews owe to Palestinian Arabs. But nationalism has always trumped spiritual and moral concerns.  Thus the endless ongoing tragedy.  It is not too late, however, to change the trajectory.  A secure existence for Jews in Israel depends on the creation of a prosperous democratic society for Palestinians.  That will require more than reparations.  It will require working relations, and building a basis for mutual trust.  Accepting at least a small number of Syrian refugees should be on the agenda for a new Israel-Palestine.  How do we start the long process towards a sane peaceful future?  I would start by supporting HIAS's call for welcoming and resettling some Syrian refugees in the United States.  Drown the hysteria with facts on the ground.  Refugees have always become Americans. That's the ever-renewing source for American resilience.  It has been a model for the world, and that model is worth defending.  It is model that Israel would do well to consider in plotting its own future.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Virtually all of Mr. Trumps falsehoods directly bolstered a powerful and self-aggrandizing narrative depicting him as a heroic savior for a nation menaced from every direction. Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, described the practice as creating an unreality bubble that he surrounds himself with.

It's not like Hillary tells the truth.  But most of her lies are complex fabrications, difficult to deconstruct. That's why I'm voting for Jill Stein. But I live in New York, so its a free vote, with no prospect of changing the election outcome. If I lived where the contest is at all close, I would vote for Clinton. Not because I believe her, but because it's possible to engage in rational discussion, organize around real issues, and hope to force her to honor the concessions she made to Bernie Sanders, like opposing TPP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Identity Politics moves us towards wider freedom only when the group (race, religion, gender, ethnicity, etc.) is seeking full inclusion, equality, an end to stigma.  Once the dog has caught the car -- the group has achieved autonomy, a place it can call its own (or, at least, equality, as people in a complex multi-identity society) -- then it is time to reconfigure.  That means taking responsibility for the consequence of our actions on others, but also working with them to make things better for us all.  It's difficult to accept complexity, let alone embrace it.  But freedom is enriched by it.  It's the identity worth fighting for.  At one time the idea of American Exceptionalism was supposed to be about that kind of vision.  Are we too poor in spirit now to keep that complex vision as our goal?  </TEXT>

To create plausible deniability, employers need only view documents establishing legitimacy; the documents themselves need not be legitimate. Employers are under no obligation to spot fakes, even if the forgeries are downright hilarious.

Let's start with a clean-slate and legalize current resident workers and their families.  Then there's a chance to control future systematic evasion by employers with a self-enforcing policy: undocumented workers can be given the incentive to become informers.  Such workers would be given green cards by turning in their employer.  The employer would be penalized with a $15,000 payment to each undocumented employee who comes forward (i.e., minimum wage for one year). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read what the man has to say, and then ask yourself: What does it mean to be American?  The attempt to turn "American" into an ethnicity is a disaster.  We are Many -- not One.  We are a mongrel lot, and need to be proud of it.  It is reactionary utopianism to think we are better off ("more secure") by turning away from our historic roots as an intentional community of people who choose free interchange under law.  The common bond of shared ideals is why the immigrant North won over the white homogeneous South.

That's what Marines, and all Americans who have served to defend this country, have to understand.  You can't just defend people like your own family and the folks you go to church with.  It doesn't work that way.  It only works when we understand we are different, but defending a common ideal.  And it works better when we try to understand each other -- even those whose tastes and backgrounds are quite different from our own.  You might call that Politically Correct.  But it is the bedrock of an American Exceptionalism that's worth fighting for. </TEXT>

"In other words, we have enough information to prevent terrorist attacks by anybody who is not from Syria? Is that what you're saying? Is that what the FBI says? We're perfectly secure"  Posner chuckled  "against everyone except Syrians?"

<TEXT> Sorry for the oversight.  This legislation, if not stopped, would be the defense of Bad History through the coercive power of the state.

I thought the "bad history" embodied in this law would be obvious.

For me, Bad History is a biased view, usually serving to support an unstated agenda.  But here that agenda is made explicit:

Polands far-right government defends this legislation as an effective legal tool in counteracting assertions that Poland and its people have any responsibility for the crimes of the Holocaust. The law is intended to combat what the government calls lies that are detrimental to Polands image and that the government considers to be found mainly in the foreign media.
It is not our mothers, not our fathers, who are responsible for the crimes of the Holocaust, caused by German and Nazi criminals in occupied [Poland], Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said at an August 16 press conference. Our duty is to defend the truth and dignity of the Polish state, and the Polish nation, but also of our fathers, our mothers, our grandfathers.

So the "defense of the truth and dignity... of our fathers..." requires the suppression of inquiry and evidence that would convince fair-minded people to reach a contrary understanding of the past.

But Pena Nieto just said No anyway, to make it perfectly clear.  At the press conference afterwards, Trump doubled down on cowardice, claiming that the subject had never come up. So Pena Nieto tweeted that Mexico had preemptively rejected Trump's non-proposal.  And then Trump found his courage.  He gave his Phoenix crowd the red meat they craved, bellowing that Mexico will pay for the Wall, but they don't know it yet.   A perfect day for a loud bully with a short stick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is why the private insurance model doesn't work.  ACA helps expand coverage.  But now the sick chickens have come home to roost -- getting care they previously couldn't afford -- and their lives are not profitable to insure.  So private insurers get out, or jack up rates.  Leaving us with a problem:  EITHER throw the sick ones overboard (unless they have the cash to pay their own bills) -- i.e., repeal ACA for Republican "consumer-driven" private health care, OR recognize that we've kicked the can down the road to a dead end, and have to replace the private insurance model with tax-financed health care for all, where we're all in, and the healthy pay up front to cover the current sick, knowing that they will be covered when their turn comes.  That's civilized -- a quaint concept, don't you think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Contrary to statements made by the Trump campaign during the Republican convention, the city, not Mr. Trump, built the golf course at Ferry Point, for $127 million. Four years ago, in a deal finalized under Mayor Michael R. Bloombergs administration, the Trump Organization came on board to operate the course, assume the expense of upkeep and build a $10 million clubhouse, yet to be erected.... The structure of the deal the city forged with the Trump Organization at Ferry Point does not require it to remit licensing fees to the city until 2019, at which point the company will pay 7 percent of gross revenue... If the entirety of Ferry Point Park, which serves a poor surrounding area, were well kept, then the presence of the golf course, meant for marketing executives in Westchester County and bond traders in TriBeCa, might be easier to tolerate. Sitting on the southeastern shore of the Bronx, Ferry Point is a vast park, bifurcated by the Whitestone Bridge. In addition to the golf course, it encompasses a nine-acre green space and playground bordering a public-housing project, just beyond a fence along the fairway, and a second area, west of the bridge. But despite all the money that went into building the course, the park, created in conjunction with it, still did not have bathrooms last year. This year, the bathrooms are in place, but the park is so poorly shaded that parents in the neighborhood said it continued to be rarely used... None of the money earmarked by the mayor to make the citys parks system more equitable has ever been directed to Ferry Point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By making this suit a "human rights" issue, the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines is staking out an important conceptual framework: that preventing climate change is a primary mission of government.  It is as important as protecting life and liberty. But holding the owners of private property accountable for the consequences of their actions does not tell us how we can correct the wrong.  This will require systemic change, beyond the scope of tort law. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a serious and detailed set of proposals, held together by the vision of an American future which has done the job that justice demands -- that succeeds in eliminating racial disparities.  It is a big task, and if some of the proposals seem "unrealistic" that is because systemic racism is a deep part of how this country is organized.  The focus may appear confrontational with existing power.  But the genius of the BLM platform is that it speaks to issues of justice and democracy which extend to all of us.  The process of winning these struggles would require, for example, free or affordable public college for everyone, oversight of law enforcement by all of our communities, etc.  And to make that actually happen, a lot of people have to become public citizens.  A lot of people understanding the need, and taking on civic responsibility is the way we take back communities from despair and violence, and from there we can take on the broader task of building a sustainable future.  The BLM Platform is a serious starting point for the discussion and action ahead.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the article:
 Among the list of grievances in the Declaration is the rarely scrutinized He [referring to the king] has excited domestic insurrections amongst us. This grievance was motivated by Virginia Royal Governor Lord Dunmores November 1775 proclamation stating that any person held as a slave by a colonist in rebellion against England would become free by joining the British forces in subduing the revolt. While 5,000 mainly free Black people from northern colonies joined with the colonists fight for independence, few of our school books teach that tens of thousands more enslaved black people joined with the British, with an even greater number taking advantage of the war to escape the colonies altogether by running to Canada or Florida. They saw they had a better shot at Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness with the British than with their colonial slave masters. General George Washington never matched the British proclamation by offering to free slaves who joined his Continental Army. </TEXT>

Trump did not condemn the publishing of the photos, and even seemed to approve of it.  Melania was one of the most successful models and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines, Trump told the Post. This was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.

Who knew what a tolerant, large-hearted soul Donald would turn out to be?  We now understand his master plan: It is in our shared appreciation of human beauty that we will find our common bond, which will bring us all together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think that's what's happening at all.  Instead, I think that Murdoch has smelled blood and decided that the Donald is a loser.  Rather than go down with him, Rupert wants to claim the prize as Trump slayer.  If I'm right, Fox News, with Ailes decapitated, and directly under the control of Rupert, will now show how "fair and balanced" it can be at Trump's expense.  Murdoch was never a true conservative.  If Trump had been credible, Murdoch would have been only too happy to have a downscale right-wing populist in power, making the world safe for Murdoch enterprises.  But Trump is a fool, and Murdoch is not.  And if Trump doesn't defend Melania, what does that make Donald? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is Donald Trump inciting an Assault? Under the rule of [law](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/assault):

Assault

At Common Law, an intentional act by one person that creates an apprehension in another of an imminent harmful or offensive contact.
An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm. It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in either criminal or civil liability. Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and Tort Law. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is Trump certifiable?
Lets allow the man to speak for himself:
After facing predictable attacks by Democrats, the man who calls his opponent Crooked Hillary told an Iowa rally:
I mean, the things that were said about me, I was going to hit a number of those speakers so hard their heads would spin, theyd never recover!

Trump then got specific:
I was going to hit one guy in particular, a very little guy. I was going to hit this guy so hard his head would spin. He wouldnt know what the hell happened.

Who might that little guy be?
Trumps Friday tweet:
Little Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!

Hmm. At a news conference two months before the end of Bloombergs term, Trump turned to him and said: Mike, I have to say, you have been a great mayor.
Tweets a year before praised both Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly for their leadership in bringing down violent crime.

<TEXT> The study is based on the limited data that is available, from cities which volunteered to provide data compiled from the reports by the police themselves.  Beyond that reporting bias, it's presented in terms of rates of lethal and (various types of) non-lethal force used, per 10,000 incidents, by race.  This does not tell us how many instances of being stopped by the police any person will encounter over a lifetime.  (For Philando Castile, the number was 52.  Had his life not been cut short, it would have been in the hundreds.)  The study only gives the chance of being subject to some form of physical force when confronted by the police (for blacks, over 20%).  And it says nothing about the proportion of police actions which are directed against innocent people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have always needed immigration. We still do. Immigrants need a welcoming community. Syrians, fleeing an ongoing holocaust, need a home. What do people who are blind to the suffering of others deserve? Pity? Contempt? Or only to remain unnoticed when they themselves are in need.
We know what is right, but Americans increasingly feel that they are in a losing battle as workers. Some get high rewards (especially in the financial sector), but most have lost bargaining power, and work-life is precarious. We have been pitted against each other, against immigrants, and against workers in other countries. In the face of lost futures, we are descending into a war of all-against-all. That's not a choice. That's not a way to live a good life.
The key to welcoming immigrants (especially people whose survival is at stake) is to build an America that meets real needs and is sustainable. That requires conscious choice, purposeful action, and, yes, clear policy choices made by our elected government. There's more than enough work that must be done if we are to achieve that goal. That would make America great again in spirit. But we must (as Bernie Sanders says) think big. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Getting beyond retrograde populism requires recognition that globalization won't go away.  Declining living standards for most people in the old wealthy world will continue, with or without immigration, unless there is a vision for our global future in which we move towards a better life for most people where they already live.  Then immigration would be a matter of personal and cultural choice rather than economic necessity.  Right now the world is increasingly being destabilized by the failure of states to meet the basic needs of their people.  Climate change is a major disruptor that has revved up the chaos, especially in the Middle East and East Africa.  Unless we stop hiding from this reality, it will inexorably overwhelm us.

<TEXT> There were [German Jews who backed Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_German_National_Jews).  They thought he was only "stirring up the masses" on the Jewish question, and agreed with him on kicking out foreigners, like East European Jews who they thought gave German Jews a bad name.  Donald is not Hitler, nor is Jared an antisemite.  But what they are playing with is stirring up the kind of nationalism that does not have a happy ending.  There is no such thing as a pure American.  We are a mongrel people, proud of it, and willing to fight those who want to deny our diversity.  "Stirring up the masses" on behalf of Christian White Nationalism is reactionary utopianism.  It is a battlecry for losers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> David Brooks sets up a false dichotomy: Do we defend an open society, or retreat behind walls? The answer to Brooks question, of course, is simple. If we are to survive, we cant go retrograde.  Its too late to close borders, and act as if the rest of the world didnt matter.  Isolation is suffocation. But the real question, which Brooks and the political class refuse to address, is: Globalization for whom?

The decline of the middle class (formerly known as the working class) in Europe and the United States is not due to immigration. It is a reflection of unsustainable inequality globally.  Uncontested capitalism, following its own inner logic, is equalizing income for the 99%.  We in the old developed world are experiencing our weakening bargaining power. Concentrated wealth is the winner -- and winner takes all.

If we are to survive, we need a new kind of globalization based on common human imperatives: to combat global warming, to live within the planet's resource limits, and to forestall the massive displacement of populations. Capitalist incentives work against achieving these survival goals.

It is becoming painfully clear that finance capitalism has failed. For the 99%, it destroys more value than it creates.  Its price for organizing production is more than we can afford.  A new mechanism is needed for the allocation of our limited resources to meet real needs  especially for the public goods that make communities viable and worth living in.

David, it's our turn now. 

The problem that underlies the rising tide of revolt across the globe is not globalization, but the failure of capitalism to produce the economy that the people of this planet need to survive.

Building the economy that we need would shift the distribution of income towards real productive actors -- labor, innovators, organizers -- and away from the engineers of financial products and illusions.

Globalization for the 99% has its own logic:  

- Sustainable economies must depend on maintaining and incorporating intact communities. Most people want to live in place, and not be wrenched away from their homes and cultures.  In a sustainable world, immigration would remain, but as a personal choice, not driven by economic necessity.    

- We must invent new paths by which we can all live in our own way, within our planetary means. We must move consciously and deliberately towards material equality.  Life would be different, but we can live well.
  
- Most of all, we must get beyond the wasteland of war.  We cant win, and neither can they, in a ruined planet. We need to mobilize all of our resources and efforts right now to build an economy that can combat global warming.

Neither business-as-usual capitalist globalization nor tribal retrenchment are viable alternatives.  A program based in meeting real needs no longer represents an idealistic goal. It is a minimum requirement for the survival of peace, democracy, and life itself.

<TEXT> If we are to survive, we cant go retrograde.  Its too late to close all the borders, and live as if the rest of the world didnt matter.  Isolation is suffocation.  

We are embedded in a planet which is at great risk.  We are hitting the long term consequences of unaccountable power.   Climate change and winner-take-all inequality are disintegrating the fabric of the old order.

We have the opportunity to act.  But not alone.  Indeed, we are now forced to save the world in order to save ourselves. 

The refugee crisis that has unhinged Europe is a reflection of a rising disorder fueled by global warming. The Arab Spring, and especially the Syrian civil war, followed a long drought that drove up food prices, and exposed old-line dictators to revolutionary unrest.  

Addressing the underlying crisis will require a new kind of globalization: to combat global warming; to re-tool and develop so that we can all live within the planet's resource limits; and to forestall the further displacement of populations.  

Capitalist incentives work against these survival goals.  Business-as-usual political economy  the offer you cant refuse  is proclaimed as the way the world works.  But it has no answers. 

Movements, like the one that mobilized behind Bernie Sanders, are our only hope to force the adoption of policies that lead to a sustainable future.  We must mobilize within our own countries, but our program must be post-national.

Before we can summon the will to make this democratic political revolution happen, we must be conscious of who we are, and who are our natural allies.  We are the 99% who have been suckered into acquiescence by a system that promised us a better tomorrow.  They lied.  

We need all of us to recognize that we have been had, and to understand that the decline of the middle class (formerly known as the working class) in Europe and the United States is not due to immigration. It is a reflection of unsustainable inequality, worldwide.  Capitalism is equalizing living conditions for the 99% globally.  That minimizes production costs.  We in the lands where wealth is concentrated find our bargaining power is continually weakening.  The share of income going to concentrated wealth is getting larger and larger.  Thats not a conspiracy.  Its just the inexorable logic of capital doing its thing: profit-maximization. (Socialism is dead,  and, no longer fearing an alternative, theres no longer a need for capital to put on a human face.)

What is needed is a democratic globalization that moves towards equality at the expense of concentrated wealth. That would start to resolve many currently insolvable problems. 

Over time it would mean reducing American and European use of material resources to their proportional share of global population. Life would be different, but, if it embodies conscious choice, our life experience would be richer in meaning, more humanly satisfying.  If we make conscious choices about what we value, we can all live well.  Measuring our wealth in human terms, we can have the time, and sense of purpose, to lead rich cultural lives, respecting our differences, and each others right to exist.  Most of all, we must get beyond the wasteland of war.  We cant afford it.  We need all of our resources and efforts to build an economy that can combat global warming.

Most people want to live in place, and not be wrenched away from their homes and cultures.  In a sustainable world, immigration would remain, but as a personal choice, not driven by economic necessity.    

Building the economy that we need will shift the distribution of income towards real productive actors -- labor, innovators, organizers -- and away from the engineers of financial products and illusions.  It will take labor trained for new tasks, and new technologies (whose availability must not be held back to profit patent-holders).  Finance capitalism has failed.  Money is a social construction.  It must be managed to create investments that meet real needs  especially for the public goods that make communities worth living in.   

A program based in meeting real needs at home and abroad no longer represents an idealistic goal.  It is a minimum requirement for the survival of peace and democracy in Europe, the U.S., and other centers of concentrated wealth.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now the power of the people cannot be dismissed. Legitimate grievances, unaddressed, have consequences. Unfortunately there is no business-as-usual solution. Even if Trump is beaten back this time, and Clinton lands the Presidency, there is no safe harbor. The political climate for the next election will be even stormier (as will the atmospheric climate) unless underlying issues are addressed.

What must we do to get out of the trap we are in? Do we need to experience another financial meltdown to make clear that old answers are bankrupt? Or can we think our way into a better future before we are ruined again?   Real needs require real answers. So what do we need?

The decline of the middle class (formerly known as the working class) in Europe and the United States is not due to immigration.  It is a reflection of unsustainable inequality globally, which capitalism is equalizing for the 99%, while our weakening bargaining power means that concentrated wealth is the winner -- and winner takes all.

What is needed is a democratic globalization that moves towards equality at the expense of concentrated wealth. That would resolve many currently insolvable problems.  Over time it would mean reducing American and European use of material resources to their proportional share of global population.  But we can all live well if we build the economy we need to combat global warming.

A sustainable world would allow people to live in place, not wrench them away from their homes and cultures. This cannot be done overnight, but we must start moving in the right direction -- away from disintegration. Building economies to live within global resource limits will take generations. It will take labor trained for new tasks, and new technologies (whose availability must not be held back to profit patent-holders). Building the economy that we need will shift the distribution of income towards real productive actors -- labor, innovators, organizers -- and away from the engineers of financial products and illusions.

A program based in meeting real needs no longer represents an idealistic goal. It is a minimum requirement for the survival of peace and democracy in Europe, the U.S., and other centers of concentrated wealth.

A social compact existed in the postwar world which protected great wealth in countries like the US, UK, and much of the EU.  An acquiescent people who accepted great inequality was bought,  albeit reluctantly, by sharing some of the benefits of wealth with the majority.  That compact is now broken. Wealth no longer feels it needs the protection of any people. The Cold War has been won, and wealth is free to go anywhere, and get away from workers and laws which are costly. The Cold War was always about making sure that there is no alternative to capitalism. More than Communism, the threats that had to be destroyed were independent movements for democratic sovereignty -- from Guatemala and Iran in the 1950s, to Greece only a year ago. 

The goal has always been a business-friendly world, safe for the globalization we have today.  In the past, when markets and production were mainly nation-bound, workers could organize, and use the state to get a better deal from capital. Now people who previously thought they were secure, are pitted against immigrants, and workers elsewhere. But it is too late for them to be saved by shutting borders.

If we are to survive, we need a new kind of globalization: to combat global warming, to live within the planet's resource limits, and to prevent the displacement of populations. Capitalist incentives work against these survival goals.

The goal has always been a business-friendly world, safe for the globalization we have today.  In the past nation-bound capitalism, it was possible for workers to organize, and use the state to get a better deal from capital.

If we are to survive, we need new kinds of incentives, to combat global warming, to live within the planet's resource limits, and to prevent the displacement of populations.  Capitalist incentives  do not offer an efficient mechanism to produce what we need. Too much gets siphoned off to those at the center of financial power.   If we don't adopt a program for survival, we will descend, step by step, into a war of all against all.  Mrs. Clinton will only learn that lesson after she realizes that she and the people around her are not in control of the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to the most recent MergerWatch report, the number of public short-term acute care hospitals in the U.S. dropped an astonishing 34 percent between 2001 and 2016. The number of secular nonprofit hospitals, too, shrunk by 11 percent, while for-profit systems shot up by more than 50 percent. In rural areas, where it is harder to turn a profit, these trends have left tremendous disparities in health care access.
Catholic hospitals help fill some of that gap  but at what cost? The ACLUs Brigitte Amiri worries that hospitals fealty to the directives over the standard of care means that for some, the delta between the services they seek and those that are available is becoming a gulf. </TEXT>

We know what is right, but Americans increasingly feel that they are in a losing battle as workers.  Some get high rewards (especially in the financial sector), but most have lost bargaining power, and work-life is precarious.  We have been pitted against each other, against immigrants, and against workers in other countries. In the face of lost futures, we are descending into a war of all-against-all.  That's not a choice.  That's not a way to live a good life. 

The key to welcoming immigrants (especially people whose survival is at stake) is to build an America that meets real needs and is sustainable. That requires conscious choice, purposeful action, and, yes, clear policy choices made by our elected government. There's more than enough work that must be done if we are to achieve that goal. That would make America great again in spirit. But we must (as Bernie Sanders says) think big. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what happens when refugees are the subject of loving concern.  That's different from PC guilt. This story comes from [HIAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIAS):
HIAS (which used to stand for Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) is an American charitable organization originally founded in response to the late 19th- and early 20th-century exodus of Jewish emigrants from Imperial Russia. The organization assists Jews and other groups of people whose lives and freedom are believed to be at risk to relocate. Since its inception HIAS has helped resettle nearly 4.5 million people.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Air Force bought tons of contaminated tomatoes from local fields that the Spanish public refused to eat. To assure the public there was no danger, commanders fed the tomatoes to the troops. Though the risk from eating plutonium is much lower than the risk from inhaling it, it is still not safe.
Breakfast, lunch and dinner. We had them until we were sick of them, said Wayne Hugart, 74, who was a military police officer at the site. They kept saying there was nothing wrong with them.
In all, the Air Force cut down 600 acres of crops and plowed under the contaminated dirt. Troops scooped up 5,300 barrels of soil from the most radioactive areas near the craters and loaded the barrels on ships to be buried in a secure nuclear waste storage site in South Carolina.
Spanish and American authorities assured villagers that they had nothing to fear. The villagers, accustomed to living in a dictatorship, did little to protest. Even if some people here might have wanted to know more, Franco was in charge, so everybody was too scared to ask anything, said Antonio Latorre, a villager who is now 78.
To assure villagers their homes were safe, the Air Force sent young airmen into local houses with hand-held radiation detectors. Peter M. Ricard, then a 20-year-old cook with no training on the equipment, remembers being told to perform scans of anything locals wanted, but to keep his detector turned off.
We were just supposed to feign our readings so we didnt cause turmoil with the natives, he said in an interview. I often think about that now. I wasnt too smart back then. They say do it and you just say, Yes, sir. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heres the comment that I submitted (it would have been longer, but got truncated by their message character limit):

America's economic future depends on making a successful transition to renewable energy.  High-Volume Horizontal Hydraulic Fracturing (fracking) would undercut that future by investing in a short-term get-rich toxic sidetrack.

Fracking is a bubble that has burst.  See some recent articles:

[Oil and Gas Exploration Bankruptcies Could Sextuple This Year](
http://fortune.com/2016/03/25/fracking-bankruptcies/)
 
[U.S. Fracking: Drilling Stalls as firms head for bankruptcy](
http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2016/02/08/us-fracking-is-having-troubles/)

[Fracking Collapses, Production Soars, No Bottom Yet in Oil Bust](
http://davidstockmanscontracorner.com/fracking-collapses-production-soars-no-bottom-yet-in-oil-bust/)

 Adequate regulations" would drive frackers out of business: Paying the full cost for the adverse consequences of fracking would make the practice unprofitable.  

For regulations to be truly protective, the profit incentive to violate rules must be eliminated.  At a minimum, limited liability entities must purchase insurance to cover the full potential damage that their actions could cause.  Enforcement efforts must be robust, and never compromised by fiscal stringency.  Fracking operators must pay these costs.  And enforcement agents must have incentives to stay independent, with no prospect of being captured by the regulated.  That requires total economic separation, before and after working to enforce the rule.  The assessment of adverse impacts should be an ongoing function, leading to periodic updating of the regulations.  

For all these reasons, none of the proposed regulations of fracking have offered an adequate defense of public health and the environment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The capital-intensity of shale oil production means that, over the course of the life for each extraction site, a critical calculation must be made before any new investment is made: that future prices will cover production costs and yield a profitable return on the initial investment.  That risk calculation has now shifted and the dial has turned from greed to fear. Low-cost existing producers of conventional oil, like the Saudis, would rather pump it all out now, before carbon taxes and caps are imposed, before solar becomes even more competitive, and before electric vehicles lead us into a driverless tomorrow.  Global economic stagnation further sours prospects.  Capital would rather play in the unreal world of speculative financial products than place its stake on a profit-challenged future.  </TEXT>

As in all human relations, mutuality, reciprocity, and respect, are the basis for justice and peace.  We can decide that the only question is to protect our own.  We can point to the crimes committed against the innocents within our own group, and determine to eliminate the Other as the source of the crime.  That is the route of endless war and, ultimately, our mutual self-destruction.  Or, we can decide to have a future in which we share a fragile world that needs our attention if any of us are to survive (think of global warming, but that's not the only existential threat).

<TEXT> (The attack) has all the markers of both an unconscionable hate crime and an act of terrorism on a scale we have not before witnessed in America, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.
This heinous attack on a nightclub serving the LGBTQ community is yet another reminder of the serious threat posed by the Islamic State terrorist group, which has inspired attacks against Jews in Belgium, journalists in France, civilians in San Bernardino and now LGBTQ men and women in America.
Greenblatt cautioned that Americans should not blame all Muslims for the actions of one individual. Whether citizens like the individual suspected of committing this act or war-torn refugees seeking safety, we must remember that we do not define people by their faith. We are deeply concerned that this attack could lead to a backlash against American Muslims. We urge all Americans to not fight hatred with hatred, but rather to come together around our common values of decency and respect. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Mr. Trump succeeded in repeatedly convincing investors, bankers and Wall Street that his name had real value.
They were so in love with him that they came back a second, third and fourth time, Mr. Hanlon said. They let him strip out assets. It was awful to watch. It was astonishing. I have to give Trump credit for using his celebrity time and time again.
In 2014, the casino company filed for bankruptcy protection for the fifth time. The chief executive cited the debt level after the 2009 bankruptcy as the primary reason.
For a time, Mr. Trump lent a glamorous sheen to the faded resort city. But some of his former investors no longer see the value.
People underestimated Donald Trumps ability to pillage the company, said Sebastian Pignatello, a private investor who at one time held stock in the Trump casinos worth more than $500,000. He drove these companies into bankruptcy by his mismanagement, the debt and his pillaging. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The move away from fossil fuel to renewable energy requires not only the generation of power but also the full range of capital, maintenance, and management structures to make systemic change work efficiently.  These include energy storage to maintain the balance between supply and demand.  The transmission-distribution system is itself part of efficient energy storage-utilization.  Increased energy efficiency in final use, and demand management to match demand with supply, must also be part of the mix to minimize cost.  So current imbalances should be seen not as failings, but as indicators of new bottlenecks and barriers which must be addressed as a new renewable energy ecosystem establishes itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not a liberal.  There's another way to think about America, the world, and the future.  It means that the past can't be kept intact, but we can make the best of the world as it is becoming. Let's change the subject so that we can solve the problem. Climate change and building sustainable economies are the conjoined challenges that will dominate this century. Immigration is only a major aspect of a larger set of issues. 

Syrian refugees are the lead wave of the coming tide of climate refugees.
Climate change and the loss of habitability in the Middle East is a primary cause for states to fail, descending into conflict, and an independent force pushing refugees to flee the region. None of the actors will survive an unmitigated climate disaster. If we are to avert a migration disaster, we must start by finding a resolution for the Syrian bloodbath. Finding a way to make Syria livable would demonstrate what must be done over the course of this century. Failure now prefigures a devastating future. The current ceasefire in Syria is a frail effort at de-escalating the conflict. But for negotiations to be fruitful, they must envision a future set of conditions in which current constituencies must come to terms with each other. They will need to modify what they each hope to obtain in the light of challenges which are not solely political. They will have to recognize that they need each other in order to counter a greater threat. Responses designed to allow Syrians, Iraqis, and others in the region to live in their historic homelands provide an alternative vision that has a chance of addressing an unfolding catastrophe, while resolving civil conflict and stanching the flow of refugees. Any program for sustainability will have to be funded. The U.S. and Europe, as well as the wealthy oil producing states, must all contribute to such an effort.

Starting in the Middle East, we must take immediate action that will prepare and employ people for the demands of this century. We need new ways that are different from what any of us have known -- relations between people and with nature which must be determined by people in their own communities in their own way. 

And for those who are the diaspora thrown out of their homelands by the failed states that have accompanied failed economies, we must also find answers -- including in the U.S. We have always needed immigration. We still do. Immigrants need a welcoming community. Syrians, fleeing an ongoing holocaust, need a home. What do people who are blind to the suffering of others deserve? Pity? Contempt? Or only to remain unnoticed when they themselves are in need. We know what is right, but American workers have been pitted against each other, and against immigrants. In the face of lost futures, divisions become more prominent. The key to welcoming immigrants (especially people whose survival is at stake) is to build an America that meets real needs and is sustainable. There's more than enough work that must be done if we are to achieve that goal. That would make America great again in spirit. But we must (as Bernie Sanders says) think big.

<TEXT> Only the indigenous people of this country -- descendants of the first settlers on this continent -- qualify as non-immigrants.  The rest of us came lately.  Our claimed right to exclude others is based on fear of difference, fear of change.  It has a price.  When we deny the creative power unleashed by our diversity, we deny what has made America great.  Give Exclusion the power to rule, and the circle of inclusion will get ever-narrower.  It is the beginning of an endless war against ourselves.  The alternative is embracing openness -- becoming different from what we started out as being.  It is the process of creating ourselves, including not only our past, but those of others, to build a future that embodies our choices and transcends our fears.   </TEXT>

California spent more than $4.2 billion on drugs in fiscal 2015, according to the state Legislative Analysts Office.
Opponents, mostly pharmaceutical companies based outside California, have poured $68.4 million to defeat the measure. Merck, Pfizer and Johnson   Johnson gave about $6 million each, according to state campaign finance data. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the measures proponent, raised $4.4 million. </TEXT>

The California Drug Price Relief Act would only allow government health programs to ink contracts with drugmakers at prices that are the same or lower than those paid by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which usually gets steep discounts from manufacturers. But Big Pharma isnt having it.... For references sake, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which supports the initiative, raised $4.4 million.... California spent more than $4.2 billion on drugs in fiscal 2015, according to the Bloomberg story, so its no surprise that the state is taking pharma to task over drug pricing. The ballot initiative recently gained support from vocal drug price critic and presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders. </TEXT>

Its foreign debt is partly owed by the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, the countrys principal generator of revenue. Venezuelan officials fear that a default would bring bondholder lawsuits. That could severely disrupt PDVSAs operations and result in seizures of the companys overseas assets  perhaps even from its Houston subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum Corporation, which owns three big refineries and has thousands of  gas stations.  Citgo is vital for Venezuela because it generates much of the oil revenue that the country is still receiving.

<TEXT> In letters to investors in 2014, Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners expressed confidence that Greece would soon be on the path to a sustainable recovery. But by the end of that year, Eaglevales leaders began to acknowledge that their perspective on the situation in Greece may have been wrong. The fund had earlier stopped taking in new money.

The problem with the Clinton family is not so much that they are corrupt tools of financialized world capitalism (i.e., Goldman Sachs), but that they actually believe the ideology -- that austerity is the necessary medicine that restores economic health.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems that some Democrats are terrified that establishment policies will be the loser in a Trump-Sanders debate.  They do not understand that those policies have already lost.  The question in a Trump-Sanders debate is: who has a credible alternative.  Trump must do better than bluster.  American Strongman Donald Trump does not have the answer.  Sanders must also make his positive vision believable.  Increasing inequality sucks money from working people.  Trump has no answer to keep that crushing from continuing.  Sanders' program for reconstructing the American economy for sustainability in the 21st Century would provide the stimulus needed to meet real needs. Retooling America and the world to handle the climate crisis is this century's alternative to war economy, except it doesn't waste resources -- it saves them.  New Deal Democrats would have embraced his program.  Can he go beyond canned phrases and really make his case?  This could be a debate worth watching.    </TEXT>

In addition, the reach of the program has been greatly reduced.

It's complex. School staff must use their common sense and humanity to judge whether an assertion of gender identity is serious and worthy of recognition. The alternative to complexity is a one-size-fits-all Procrustean "solution". The one chosen by benighted states like North Carolina solves the problem by making transgendered people's lives impossible to live. No transgenders -- No problem. Of course that logic extends to all forms of otherness. Some of us feel most free when everybody is exactly the same. Other people accept the burden of diversity which allows a much greater range for the free spirit of humanity to express itself in the world. That choice defines a society. People who cherish diversity tend to live in interesting places. Of course, they have the attendant problem: they have the responsibility of finding out who they really are, rather than just doing what their parents and community tell them they must do.

Roy Cohn is a figure in American history who is well known to people at least of our generation, probably not so much to the one thats casting a lot of ballots now. But Roy Cohn was the sidekick and chief witch hunter for Senator Joseph McCarthy, a guy who reminds a lot of people of Ted Cruz. You know, they both look alike, and they talk alike. And after Royafter Roy Cohn had left the Senate, he went into private practice, and he set himself up basically as the house counsel to a couple of the crime bosses in New York Citythe Genovese crime family and the Gambino crime family. And at the same time, he adopted a young developer from Queens looking to make his first mark as a developer in Manhattan named Donald J. Trump. And Donald J. Trump will tell you, to this day, that he learned how to play politics and he learned how to play development from Roy Cohn, while he was sitting in Roy Cohns East Side townhouse next to "Fat Tony" Salerno and "Big Paul" Castellano. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shiller's theory of swings in the economy is psychology-driven.  There is no doubt that panics and "irrational exuberance" are amplified by social-psychological mood-swings.  But there is no room in his theory to recognize a real global economy as the underlying structure that both constrains and predisposes the subjective states which interest him.  The housing bubble did not burst because people were suddenly told there was a bubble, and believed it.  Many analysts were crying "bubble" for years, and dismissed as alarmists, until the bubble cracked by itself.  Loss of confidence when you are aware that the floor has dropped out from under you cannot be restored by closing your eyes and saying "I Believe Everything's Fine."    </TEXT>

<TEXT> He points out the degree to which the party has become captive to economic elites whose agendas dont necessarily represent the rest of Americas. Mr. Sanders, who raised more than $200 million through small donations, even cast doubt on Democrats claims that they need big-money backers to succeed.

The Stockholm Syndrome is when captives, held for a long time, identify with their captors.  It's a short-term survival mechanism that becomes habit, and then a way of life.  Clinton corporate Democrats orient towards existing power.  They see their role as supplicants, negotiating out of weakness, always working within the framework of corporate rule, selling policies, like healthcare, as a great business plan for Big Pharma and the insurance industry.  What they have always had to sell is their ability to assure consent of the people. They told us not to struggle, just trust them to speak for us.  Bernie's opened the escape hatch.  A lot of people are no longer in the herd.  Now they have to figure out how to continue to act together, finding the means as well as the will to wrest back their democratic power.

<TEXT> The global capitalist economy suffers chronically from insufficient effective demand, disabling the incentive it needs to mobilize liquidity into active production.  Private demand is insufficient precisely because profit depends as much on cost-cutting as it does on demand. Cost-cutting achieved through increased productivity and efficiency, can grow the real economy.  But as the global reservoir of labor, much of it still outside the capitalist market, gets increasingly pulled into a global wage labor force, competitive pressures pull down labor's share of global income.  In this context, added liquidity produces mainly bubbles.

An economy rooted in the real would recognize the demand that the future must exert on the present, in order for us to have a future.  Multi-trillions of dollars of investment are needed if we are to survive, and live decently, within the planet's natural limits.  Recognizing the validity of this demand, and allowing it to direct resource allocation, is the fundamental task of a new political economy. 

What Metcalfe gets right is the need to finance projects that move us towards global sustainability. But the scope of his proposal must be recognized as just a start.  

Metcalfe says:         

 They [SDRs] could, for example, be used to buy bonds issued by the UN's Green Climate Fund. This was a fund created in 2009, following that climate agreement in Copenhagen. And it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries to meet their climate projects. It's been one of the most successful funds of its type, raising almost 10 billion dollars. But if we use those extra SDRs that were issued, it helps governments get back on track, to meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year that was derailed by the financial crisis. 

But the Green Climate Fund cannot, with any credibility, issue bonds for projects unless those projects can ultimately repay their loans.  While some projects may need only a little help to be profitable, much of the transformation we need are public goods (like extreme weather resiliency measures) which cannot be expected to achieve positive market returns on investment. Putting a price on carbon would help even the playing field for renewable energy, but that, too, is only a part of what must be done. 

Adaptation to climate change, and mitigation of its causes (GHG emissions) must also be integrated into a larger vision moving us towards a sustainable global economy.  

Metcalfe raises the fear of unconstrained money creation:

 Once you break down and dismantle the idea that money is a finite resource, governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people to print more and more money for other causes: education, health care, welfare -- even defense.  

Yes, we must all live within real limits.  The revenues from a carbon tax could provide a major portion of the funding needed for the great transition. We must acknowledge, however, that even this would not be enough to save the planet. 

But I must believe that people are capable of recognizing the dire conditions we face with respect to the climate. Living within constraints, even real sacrifices, becomes possible if there is justice, a real safety net, and solidarity. The mobilization for World War II comes to mind.  (The Republican Party in the US is an outlier in denying climate reality.  But defeating that mindset is only the first step towards accepting, and ultimately embracing, what the future requires of us.)

Only when we are working with broad agreement about what must be done can we allocate scarce resources effectively, while minimizing our regrets.  

We must build a vision that a sustainable future is possible to achieve, and worth fighting for.  With that in mind, money must be directed now into projects which can show us how that future can work. 

Such investment should be in the form of grants, not loans.

Metcalfe shows us the way:

 And just to think what amazing things could be done with that money, consider this: in 2009, Norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to Brazil if they followed through on their goals on deforestation. That program has since delivered a 70 percent reduction in deforestation in the past decade. That's saving 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is the equivalent of taking all American cars off the roads for three whole years. So what could we do with 300 other pay-for-performance climate projects like that, organized on a global scale? We could take cars off the roads for a generation.

<TEXT> In this century we're in a climate crisis.  It has already begun. If we do not recognize and respond to that emerging reality, we will descend into a war of all against all.  It is the existential question of our lives.

Syrian refugees are the lead wave of the coming tide of climate refugees.  

Climate change and the loss of habitability in the Middle East is a primary cause for states to fail, descending into conflict, and an independent force pushing refugees to flee the region.  None of the actors will survive an unmitigated climate disaster. See: [intolerable heat may hit the middle east](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/science/intolerable-heat-may-hit-the-middle-east-by-the-end-of-the-century.html), [extreme heatwaves could push gulf climate beyond human endurance](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/extreme-heatwaves-could-push-gulf-climate-beyond-human-endurance-study-shows), and [Future temperature in southwest Asia projected to exceed a threshold for human adaptability](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v6/n2/full/nclimate2833.html).

Both water shortage and sea level rise are other aspects of climate change which threaten long term habitability in the region.

If we are to avert a migration disaster, we must start by finding a resolution for the Syrian bloodbath. Finding a way to make Syria livable would demonstrate what must be done over the course of this century.  Failure now prefigures a devastating future. 

The current ceasefire in Syria is a frail effort at de-escalating the conflict.  Cooling the violence is a precondition for negotiations to begin.  But for negotiations to be fruitful, they must envision a future set of conditions in which current constituencies must come to terms with each other.  They will need to modify what they each hope to obtain in the light of challenges which are not solely political.  They will have to recognize that they need each other in order to counter a greater threat. 

Responses designed to allow Syrians, Iraqis, and others in the region to live in their historic homelands provide an alternative vision that has a chance of addressing an unfolding catastrophe, while resolving civil conflict and stanching the flow of refugees.  Any program for sustainability will have to be funded. The U.S. and Europe, as well as the wealthy oil producing states, must all contribute to such an effort.   

If ISIS and al Qaeda remain at war with everyone else, they cannot be a part of any resolution.  But while their domain of control can be reduced, contained and isolated, they cannot be crushed by force.   

The blowback from collateral damage is greater than any military objective achieved by armed intervention.  The problem lies not with the US military, but with the mission, which cannot be accomplished in the real world at an acceptable cost.  The result of a misguided policy based on cheap victories by drone and bomb is that the perpetrators (not only the U.S., but also the Russians and the Saudis) lie, denying their murder of innocents.  Such lies destroy the trustworthiness of the liar.  Their impact is to strengthen the enemy even more than the initial crimes do.  In the eyes of those who identify with those wrongly attacked, we become the terrorists. 

Violent fundamentalism will spread as long as the conditions that generate it prevail.   Poverty, corruption, and subjugation are the conditions which potentiate violent reaction.  The basic source of attraction for fundamentalism is its totalitarian rejection of an unjust, unresponsive and failing old order.   On the other side, an open society is not possible without social order.  If social order is to survive, it must be reformed to address peoples aspirations and needs. 

Climate change is already occurring and will intensify into the future fueled by past greenhouse gas emissions.  We must stop adding to the fuel.  But there is also an enormous agenda of work to do for communities and society to survive the climate change we cannot prevent.   Fundamentalism has no answers for this.  It can only derange the complex order we must have to effectively respond to the challenge. We need everyone to work towards an inclusive future.  Starting in the Middle East, we must take immediate action that will prepare and employ people for the demands of this century.  We need new ways that are different from what any of us have known -- relations between people and with nature which must be determined by people in their own communities in their own way.

Climate change will, in this century, create hundreds of millions of refugees who will be dispossessed both directly and covertly.  It was the multi-year drought that set up for the failure of the Syrian state.  

Communities must be supported to evolve under conditions of change, rather than become atomized and dispersed.  But, where large numbers of people have to relocate, the difficulties of transplantation must be acknowledged.  Only Pope Francis gets close to the proper dimensions of the human issues at stake.

In a world without vision, it seems only the most shortsighted self-interest motivates action. But there is a long-term price to pay.  Order cannot be maintained against a rising tide of sorrow. Ever-growing Disorder will consume us, state by state. Turkey and Lebanon are already at a breaking point.  Jordan is close. And then there is Greece.   

We can decide that we are incapable of facing a menacing problem.  Trump and the new German Nationalist party, the AfD [Alternative fr Deutschland], will succeed when we deny our common humanity.

Or we can mobilize for a global response. If we are to take climate change seriously, we must expect large-scale displacement of populations in this century because we can't reverse the damage fast enough to protect large parts of our human habitat. We will have to build a global economy on a sustainable basis if we are to survive.  

That task must start now, with today's dispossessed. How can they be integrated into a more just and sustainable future?   Current policies will not get us to where we need to go. The answer starts as a moral-political stance. It is a choice of what's worth fighting for, and taking the first step forward.  America, recognizing itself as the homeland of refugees, must continue to live her proud heritage.  She must lead by example. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As usual, Trump is strong on naming what's wrong.  It doesn't take a genius to call out the shambles.  Interventionism always costs more than any of its champions ever imagined, and unleashes consequences well beyond their imagination.  

But America First is nostalgia not vision.  We're 5% of the world, using 25% of the world's resources.  The cost of defending that inequality is a military stance that keeps the dollar king.  In the grand imperial design, we have the money, they make the goods. Our economic "strength" is as Consumer for the world's output.    That's so 20th Century.  It can't last, and Trump offers no alternative vision.

<TEXT> The root flaw of cynicism is that it rests on the belief that we don't need each other in order to survive, or, if we do, some of us can, forever,  take more from others than we are willing to give,  That egoism is the illusion that leads to the mess.  The alternative is a recognition of interdependence.  Humility is empowering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A moral economy is one which serves human needs and keeps the planet livable.  Capital accumulation as an end in itself has some fatal flaws.  It grows by ever-expanding debt, on the assumption of limitless growth, that will always be large enough to repay past debts, to keep the whole game credible.  But that's no longer working.  Instead, we get bubbles and busts.  Real wealth has stagnated.  What to do? Assume that global warming is real, and very threatening.  It does not present market signals that promote survival.  What's needed is a global-political re-orientation to direct resources for a sustainable future.  For that future to be worth living in, it must involve people in decision-making, and as much local control as possible.  That's where all this must go, or we can just give up the fight.  Bernie and Francis and betting that humans will fight to survive.  And that fight must be cooperative. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 "worked" if you don't count the multi-generational continuing collateral damage to communities of color, and to the fabric of American society.  Yes, violent crime had to be addressed. But Bill (and Hillary's) solution was only repression and retribution.  The economic choices that were needed for sustainable growth were not in their play book.  That's because they chose to rely on an expanding financial sector, and lowering real wages.  Their "realism" told them that "What's good for Wall Street is good for the country."  And then the bubble burst.  America's hollowed economy has not recovered.  It is producing only precarious low-wage life prospects. The circle  outside the comfort zone only widens.  Bill and Hillary believe we must still depend on the way things get done by Wall Street.  But that hasn't worked for most people. The question is: can we find other drivers to build an economy that meets real needs, employs people to do productive work, and gives people reason to hope for a better life, like we did 80 years ago in the New Deal?  Hillary will never ask that question.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bernie Sanders follows the long and honorable American political tradition called "sewer socialism". It's not very romantic. It starts with being open to noticing real problems that people have, and finding workable solutions. I was afraid that that part of American history -- the spirit of public service that made this country work -- had been lost forever. But it hasn't. Maybe we're getting past being demobilized by cynicism. According to Wikipedia: In 1961, Progressive editor William Evjue wrote of the Wisconsin Socialist legislators he had known, "They never were approached by the lobbyists, because the lobbyists knew it was not possible to influence these men. They were incorruptible." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump supporters may not be a majority of Americans, but they are, at least, a large portion of the population, and they are not going to disappear, even if Trump loses.  Together with the large base of support for Bernie Sanders, there is clearly an anti-establishment majority in this country that is no longer silent.  To keep their power intact, those who have ruled us have only one option left: keep that majority divided against itself, let them destroy each other.  Whoever is elected, a new politics is needed, based on people talking together and organizing themselves locally against our joint enemy: concentrated wealth using the power of the state to convert public need into private profit.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Randa Kassis, representing a Moscow-backed opposition group, said de Mistura would distribute a document of common points gathered from the various delegates.
Points included creating a future unified Syrian army to fight terrorism or ensuring a democratic and non-sectarian based Syria.
"We're waiting for a U.S.-Russian accord to solve the (key) issue once and for all. Until they resolve it this process will drag on," Kassis told Reuters.

Who knew that there is "a Moscow-backed opposition group" and that it is waiting for the U.S. and Russia to make a deal, and then each lay down the line to their respective clients, Assad and the HNC?  That still leaves Iran/Hezbollah and Saudi Arabia to tire of this conflict.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bernie Sanders follows the long and honorable American political tradition called "sewer socialism". It's not very romantic. It starts with being open to noticing real problems that people have, and finding workable solutions. I was afraid that that part of American history -- the spirit of public service that made this country work -- had been lost forever. But it hasn't. Maybe we're getting past being demobilized by cynicism.
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewer_Socialism): In 1961, Progressive editor William Evjue wrote of the Wisconsin Socialist legislators he had known, "They never were approached by the lobbyists, because the lobbyists knew it was not possible to influence these men. They were incorruptible." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a plan to kick the refugees down the road.  What will really happen to these people?  That's not the issue.  Make Them Go Away is the operating principle.   In a world without vision, it seems only the most shortsighted self-interest motivates action.  But there is a long term price to pay.  Increasingly desperate people are fleeing disintegrating states and economies.  Blindness to their plight is a decision to let them suffer and die.  But Order cannot be maintained against a rising tide of sorrow. Ever-growing Disorder will consume us, state by state. Turkey and Lebanon are already at a breaking point. 

We can decide that we are incapable of facing a menacing problem.  Or we can mobilize for a global response.  If we are to take climate change seriously, we must expect large-scale displacement of populations in this century because we can't reverse the damage fast enough to protect large parts of our human habitat.  We will have to build a global economy on a sustainable basis if we are to survive.  That task must start now, with today's dispossessed.  How can they be integrated into a more just and sustainable future?  All I know is that The Old Order will not get us to where we need to go. The answer to the existential question starts as a moral-political stance.  It is a choice of what's worth fighting for, and taking the first step forward. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Russell Moore is president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. Richard Stearns is president of World Vision U.S. Together they are supporting the #prayforrefugees campaign.

 As evangelical leaders in the U.S., we are concerned about the growing hostility toward refugees. Thats why we are calling on Christians of all stripes to do the one thing that has the power to change this dynamic: pray. ... Prayer has been ridiculed of late as an ineffectual response to tragedy and urgent physical needs. We disagree. Action that leads to systemic change starts with prayer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long-term, coal is a risky investment if the world really takes climate change seriously enough to reduce global carbon emissions, through regulation, carbon pricing, and continued clean energy innovation.
Short-term, it is even riskier, because Saudi Arabia stopped supporting the world energy market, when it ceased its post-1973 OPEC cartel policy of withholding production.  Now its own cheap supply of oil is flooding the market.  After the OPEC collapse, there is a temporary overhang in supply that has cut all energy prices, so that even coal is a loser. 
While much of the newly developed supplies, like Bakken shale oil, can't pay back their cost of investment, they're still producing at developed sites, until they're pumped or fracked out.
So that leaves coal without a business plan, except for the belief that the old days will return, and Coal will again be King.     </TEXT>

They despise the very independence that makes Bernie beloved.  There is one exception, however, that could convince superdelegates to bail out of the SS Hillary:  if they understand the dangers of staying on a sinking ship -- i.e., it becomes clear that Hillary's ethical issues torpedo her chances to win.  Then what Sanders said (though unlikely) is not a mad unprincipled pipe dream.    </TEXT>

His low tolerance for frustration provides ample concern that he will act out, and he will exceed the limits of forbearance on the part of others. Lord help us. Should we find ourselves placed under his power, it will be because a resentful people cannot understand what went wrong with their American Dream. Optimism is a conceit that is attached to those who believe they have (or will have) Power. With belief in ones own effective agency, there comes Responsibility. People who believe they have control of their futures will grasp for a vision of the whole. The American Dream was a global vision  capitalist democratic tolerant meritocratic. It had the superego to construct a world with rights  i.e., self-constraints  with room for "reasonable accommodations to increase inclusion, into American society, and globally, nurtured from a rationalist cornucopia  an ever-expanding American pie., But the civilized trappings of an optimistic people have been stripped away as futures darken. Trump promises id victories for a people who have lost the ego-strength to calculate risk, or to consider What price victory? And, even if Trump loses, the erosion of civilized restraint will remain, until the underlying causes of bitterness are addressed. That is why Hillary cannot put this demon back into its box.

<TEXT> The documentation of war crimes from all sides should be thought of as a kind of "site preparation" necessary prior to reconstructing the rule of law in Syria and the whole region.  Those who are responsible for crimes against humanity have lost their legitimacy to rule over others.  Yet we have to start with the world we have.  There is no outside savior who can impose good governance.  
But if public outrage against these crimes can be maintained over time, domestically and worldwide, the perpetrators can be pushed aside.  That is what happened in Latin America over the course of a generation.  Commitment to human rights may be a slow path, but, there is no alternative, no matter how much we would like there to be.  So far, every quick fix has failed.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nobody is FOR illegal immigration, including Bernie Sanders.  See his plan: https://berniesanders.com/issues/a-fair-and-humane-immigration-policy/
The question about immigration is how to manage it.  The construction of a sustainable American economy in this century will require more people working hard, not fewer.  Immigrants are a necessary part of the mix.   Welcoming people we need means that we must treat everyone with respect, and expect that they will do what immigrants have always done -- taken onto themselves most of the burden of adjustment.  Protecting immigrant workers as fellow workers is the best way to assure that they do not undercut wages and working conditions.  When the American economy was strong, workers were able to organize, and their unions, protected by a friendly government, were able to win decent labor conditions.  The American standard of living topped off in the early '70s, when labor unions were strong, and have been eroding ever since.  Inclusion and unity is the only power that most people, who are not wealthy, have to protect themselves.  Divided, we will continue to fail and fall.  In egging on a war within the plundered majority, only Trump wins. </TEXT>

At a rally in December, he tweeted, "A man came up to me to say 'Go back to Iraq!' I've never been!"
And in January, he tweeted, "A Trump supporter just asked me at Reno event if I was taking pictures for ISIS. When I looked shocked, he said, 'yeah, I'm talking to you.'" </TEXT>

<TEXT> My actual name is Bernie, and I have been a very small contributor to Bernie Sanders' campaigns since 1990.  So, I feel entitled to say to my fellow Bernie supporters who attend Trump rallies: Silent Witness is fine (and extremely courageous), but attempting to silence even Fascist speech is always a mistake.  So: NOT IN MY NAME.  Don't give them the excuse they crave to act out.  Both Trump and Sanders supporters have too much in common, as the plundered majority, to be set upon each other as enemies.  We need each other if we are to get free of the agenda imposed by the concentrated power complex -- Wall St. banks, transnational corporations, corrupted government, mainstream media, etc.  We need to learn how to respect each other, to speak to each other, and share our common experiences.  So when Trump supporters come to disrupt Sanders events, our response should not be to exclude them, but to draw them in.  Let's all sing We Shall Overcome, and hope they join.  And if they shout down Bernie, let's repeat his words, phrase by phrase, as we did in Occupy Wall St.'s "mic check".  Then we can all get the message.  If we all stop and think, we will have a chance to act responsibly, effectively.  We'll do more than survive.  We'll win.  </TEXT>

and then there's all that private land that must be seized by eminent domain, and the violation of environmental laws, and the construction of dozens of new roads to connect border wilderness with the rest of the country to permit construction workers and material to get to the construction sites, which will make infiltration into the country dozens of times more costly to police, once the coyotes figure out a way to get people over the top of the wall -- and they will.

Over a lifetime in politics she has made herself into the most acceptable face for selling the Wall Street agenda.  But post-2008 the public has caught on that increasing inequality is at their expense.  Romney was more of a representative of the .01% than Obama.  That's why he lost.  Trump is a demagogue wild card.  He could easily win against Hillary.  Bernie has been painfully honest all of his life.  He has no skeletons in the closet.  And he's right on the issues.  Does he have your vote?  If you're convinced, then he'll win the nomination and the Presidency.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> A stake in the heart of Trump Place?

 Concerned about illicit money flowing into luxury real estate, the Treasury Department said Wednesday that it would begin identifying and tracking secret buyers of high-end properties.

 The initiative will start in two of the nations major destinations for global wealth: Manhattan and Miami-Dade County. It will shine a light on the darkest corner of the real estate market: all-cash purchases made by shell companies that often shield purchasers identities.

 It is the first time the federal government has required real estate companies to disclose names behind cash transactions, and it is likely to send shudders through the real estate industry, which has benefited enormously in recent years from a building boom increasingly dependent on wealthy, secretive buyers. </TEXT>

Anything short of a global resolution of the underlying issues creates pressures which are destabilizing. Unfortunately, simpleminded "solutions" like those offered by Trump and other anti-immigrant populists, appear attractive.  "Am I my brother's keeper?" they ask.  It is a Faustian trap.  Give up your soul and keep your benefits.   Don't feel compassion, don't feel anything for others, and you will be free. That path leads to an endless war of all against all. </TEXT>

That means reasonable accommodation for differences -- whether that is for disability or gender or language or religion, etc.  It is not "natural" nor comfortable to have to be conscious and respectful of others.  But we must bear the cost of diversity if we want to live in free and complex societies.  Those who want to live in walled off ghettoes of their own making, limited to their own kind, do not understand that they are in fact embedded in, and dependent upon, a functioning and complex world.  Their gated communities in fact live in fear of attack.  They cannot trust the servants they hire.  Freedom only becomes sustainable when it celebrates diversity, and structures society in favor of increasing equality in the power of each of us to express and meet our needs.    </TEXT>

People from different cultures are not automatically integrated into existing society, and that society, itself, must be open to some change.  All this requires people who are willing to engage, person-to-person, and to mutually set the terms for a respectful relationship.  It is not easy to get to a happy resolution, but you can be certain it will never happen if we simply assume our common humanity is enough to assure harmony.  What we do know is that exclusion takes us down the self-destructive path of reactionary utopianism.  Purity is a myth, as Germans know only too well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reason magazine quotes one analyst, who finds that undereducated rural residents are dying faster because they're not fit to survive market forces.  And they shouldn't be helped:

  "The provision of subsidies to induce people to stay in that place delays the inevitable. At worst, such subsidies effectively retain the kinds of people who are the least able to adjust, ultimately, to market forces."

Letting the economically weak die sooner is a sure way to raise average income.  At last we have a credible libertarian prescription for reducing poverty, which does not claim that the magic of the untrammeled market will actually make us richer as individuals.   It makes a more modest claim: Collectively, We are richer, when we let market forces do the job of killing off the losers faster.

The cut-line for survival-of-the-fittest is a sliding scale.  It used to be that a growing portion of the population got to live longer.  That is no longer true. Ask not for whom the market bell tolls. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These Commentaries put the Paris Agreement in perspective, from an establishment academic point of view.  Taken as a whole, they show that there is a sea change in the conventional wisdom on long term prospects for energy investments.  The rationale for future fossil fuel exploration and development appears to be reduced to the force of inertia, rather than any more rational calculation.  Yet inertia is powerful.  The Paris Agreement cedes to us all of the arguments, and none of the power.  We already had on our side science, justice, and an appreciation of the adverse consequences of inaction.  Now we have hypocrisy on our side ("Hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue).  Ultimately it will be social pressure, organized in movements, but also incorporated into a new conventional wisdom, that must be a strong enough force to turn the ship, and take us on a new course, whose end is not the end of the human project.

<TEXT> Expensive dangerous drill-baby-drill fossil fuel energy has hit a dry hole. But the whole project was predictably unsupportable. It was doomed by the overreach in development of "unconventional oil". It was the increase of supply, from the Bakken and other unconventional plays, that eroded Saudi market share at $100+ per barrel. The Saudis have responded to their loss of power and control in the global market for oil by abandoning monopoly pricing, effectively killing OPEC.  But so far, cheap oil is not enough to reflate a stagnant world economy, and prices have failed to rebound after the shake out.  Meanwhile, new high-cost production has suffered a fatal blow.
Shell's decision to abandon exploration and development in the Arctic sends strong warning to investors.
Shell's CEO in fact exited the project at the first sign of trouble.  He, at least, understands how to abandon a sinking ship.
The NY Times, reporting on Shell's decision, lays it out:
"The decision indicates that even though the oil industry believes the Arctic has major resources, the costs, a tricky environment and other risks are so high in the area that the hidden oil and gas will be difficult to develop if oil prices stay low." 
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/business/international/royal-dutch-shell-alaska-oil-exploration-halt.html

This is a huge loss for Shell, not only in money, but also in credibility.  They had believed their own propaganda rather than recognize the new reality.
Wishful thinking by locked-in investors may convince some to hold on, and wait for an upturn in global demand to save the day.  But would new investors, untied to their previous commitments, decide to place their bets now on Shell and its confreres?  I think not.
The grounds for investment are no longer the same.  New conditions require a new strategy, and urgently so. Leadership is needed among institutional investors to withdraw their stake quickly and responsibly from fossil fuels.
At the Paris COP 21 meeting at least some institutional investors, are putting the developers of new high-cost, high-risk production on notice:  [More Than $3.4 Trillion in Assets Vow to Divest From Fossil Fuels](http://insideclimatenews.org/news/02122015/divestment-campaign-grows-more-34-trillion-assets-vow-exit-fossil-fuels) 

The fossil fuel industry must commit to a new game plan, now, shelving their previous plans, and become part of a sustainable future, or lose sophisticated investors.  And with that loss, the true risk of their practice -- financially as well as to our environment --will become apparent to the wider community of investors.  That is a warning they cannot afford to ignore, and a risk they cannot afford to take. </TEXT>

Deutsche Bank: solar at grid parity in most of world by 2017
http://www.energypost.eu/deutsche-bank-solar-grid-parity-world-2017/

Mohammed El-Erian makes the point that the decline in the price of oil may be long lasting because the objective is to restore Saudi institutional predominance, rebuilding its market share, which takes time.

Elias Hinckley sees the Saudis as playing the fossil fuel endgame.  He has an amazing quote:
       In 2000, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, former oil minister of Saudi Arabia, gave an interview in which he said:
     Thirty years from now there will be a huge amount of oil  and no buyers. Oil will be left in the ground. The Stone Age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil.

These articles should serve as a warning to investors against fossil-fuel holdings.  If the Saudis are letting the fossil-fuel ship sink (carrying off as much of their winnings as possible) then it would make sense for prudent investors to re-balance their portfolios.

The critical question is whether these analyses of Saudi policy are credible.  Can they be easily dismissed as "alarmist"?  If not, what are the implications for decision-makers?

An analysis of long-term Saudi policy options must consider the maximization of net revenue,  Saudi geopolitical objectives, and the constraints they face in achieving these goals.

Let the risk assessment begin!

<TEXT> Chelsea Manning understands that you can't bomb a hostile sea into submission.  Nor can you sink new foundations to build "from the bottom up" when you are dwelling in a penthouse in a different society which itself has a rotten foundation. We all see the decay here, but deny its implications: "We" are in no position to build a world of justice and opportunity -- the basis of real security -- until we cede our ambition to control other people.

Chelsea Manning does have the answer.  It is what she has already done -- seeing injustice, and doing what conscience demands.   Personal courage rooted in a belief in our common humanity is a motive force. There is no higher purpose than respect -- of oneself and of others.  We need each other's otherness.  We cannot recast other nations as our servants, or even as our clones.  

Because we are not complete, we cannot be closed and be alive. Openness is not weakness. It is what we need: personal connection knitting life's fabric, which has been torn apart.  Refugees become us when they are taken in and respected, not as victims but as peers.  In that human relationship, we change. That is the hope which overcomes terror.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kasparov is right about the folly of allying with Putin and those seeking Shi'a hegemony in the region.  It will only harden Sunni determination to fight.  Terrorism is the last desperate card played by the weak.  It itself offers no hope for peace.  It is endless war, and the weaker party eventually must fail, even if it imposes huge damage on its adversary.  But Kasparov is wrong about the power of NATO to rid the world of such terrorism.  It would be as popular as having the IDF lead the charge -- precisely because Israel's aggressive "self-defense", squeezing the Palestinians into ever-shrinking ghettos, is a moral blindspot for the West.  It makes it impossible to overcome the humiliation-revenge syndrome in the Arab world, which is the bedrock of jihadi nihilism.  The only hope for a healthy peaceful future for us all is to renounce domination, and press, and provide assistance, for changes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the whole region, to meet the material needs of their peoples, and open themselves to popular governance.  Israel must understand that it will be defended only if it reduces its ambitions to, essentially, its 1967 borders.  That is the political sea change that offers hope -- a world that young Muslims might be willing to fight to defend against the dark night of ISIS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> private consumption today accounts for only around 38 percent of Chinas gross domestic product. That is a sharp contrast to the industrialized nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where consumption on average accounts for more than 60 percent of G.D.P....  Because of a reliance on state investment  often in wasteful projects or loss-making industries  the country accrued record levels of debt, which stands at nearly 300 percent of G.D.P.

China's problem is that its expansion depends on raising its market share in other countries.  But that requires it to remain competitive with other poor countries, like Vietnam and Bangladesh.  Raising the domestic standard of living without raising the cost of labor is a neat trick to accomplish.  The only way that could be done is by investing in public goods which allow people to live better, even if their incomes are low -- like public transportation and subsidized housing.  But the Chinese model assumes that final demand will pay back investments.  That's what's not working.  Both speculative investment and Statist planning produce failure.  What China needs is Democratic Socialism.  China needs its own Bernie Sanders. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Unesco director general, Irina Bokova, expressed her objection to the resolution on Tuesday in a stern statement, saying it could be seen to alter the status of the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls.

 The Western Wall, as part of the Old City of Jerusalem, is a Unesco World Heritage site adjacent to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, and its protection is central to the Unesco mandate. The protection of cultural heritage should not be taken hostage, the statement from Ms. Bokovas office said.

Perhaps the only good result of the Arab proposal is that the U.N. staff has come out so strongly against their provocative action.  There must be a limit to Israeli ambitions, but limits also apply to Arabs and Muslims.  Sovereign control in a land which must be shared in common is an illusion.  These illusions, acted out, are the transgressions which justify all of the blood, all of the suffering. Enough.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> This makes divestment from fossil fuel developers an urgent task for those who are entrusted with our pension funds, and with the endowments of hospitals and colleges. Expensive dangerous drill-baby-drill fossil fuel energy has hit a dry hole. The Obama administration's decision reveals a deeper fact:  the drill-baby-drill project was a bubble -- an unsupportable mirage. It was doomed by its own overreach, pouring billions into the development of "unconventional oil". It was the increase of supply, from the Bakken and other unconventional plays, that eroded Saudi market share at $100+ per barrel. The Saudis responded to their loss of power and control in the global market for oil by abandoning monopoly pricing, effectively killing OPEC.  But so far, cheap oil is not enough to reflate a stagnant world economy, and prices have failed to rebound after the shake out.  Meanwhile, new high-cost production has suffered a fatal blow. Wishful thinking by locked-in investors may convince some to hold on, and wait for an upturn in global demand to save the day.  But would new investors, untied to their previous commitments, decide to place their bets now on Shell and its confreres?  The Obama administration is signaling it is time to stop enabling a losing gamble. The grounds for investment in developing fossil fuels have proven to be a sinkhole.  New conditions require a new strategy, and urgently so.  Divestment is not just the socially responsible thing to do.  Leadership is needed among institutional investors to withdraw their stake quickly and responsibly from fossil fuels.  As we enter the run-up to the Paris COP 21 meeting in December, institutional investors must put the developers of new high-cost, high-risk production on notice:  They must commit to a new game plan, now, in Paris, to shelve their previous plans, and become part of a sustainable future, or lose the confidence and the funds of these sophisticated investors.  And with that loss, the true risk of their practice -- financially as well as to our environment -- will become apparent to the wider community of investors.  That is a warning big oil cannot afford to ignore, and a risk they cannot afford to take. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So who's the maniac?  Here's what Wikipedia has to say:
[Egomania is also known as an obsessive preoccupation with one's self and applies to someone who follows their own ungoverned impulses and is possessed by delusions of personal greatness and feels a lack of appreciation. Someone suffering from this extreme egocentric focus is an egomaniac. The condition is psychologically abnormal. The term egomania is often used by laypersons in a pejorative fashion to describe an individual who is intolerably self-centred. The clinical condition that most resembles the popular conception of egomania is narcissistic personality disorder.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egomania) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The program has been under siege from the start, including from the insurance industry. Before the law's passage, government grants to help them get going were switched to loans. None of that money could go for advertising - a wounding rule for new insurers that needed to attract customers. Moreover, the amount available was cut from $10 billion to $6 billion and then later, as part of the administration's budget deals with congressional Republicans, to $2.4 billion. Federal health officials abandoned plans for a co-op in every state.

<TEXT> Your economic analysis is correct.  The question is what regulatory intervention would serve the long-term best interest of society (remember, corporations are totally dependent on laws, infrastructure, a healthy economy that can support demand, etc., no matter how much they would like to deny their dependence on the well-being of society). 
We want to allow enough profit to provide sufficient incentive to assure a continuing investment in safe effective pharmaceutical products.  But patent monopolies grant unlimited profits by creating artificial, unnecessary shortages, denying most people the benefits of life-saving drugs.  There must be better solutions.
One way to go is for the government to use its power of eminent domain to purchase selected patents from drug companies, for drugs which prove vital to life.  The cost becomes socialized, and production can be licensed for free, allowing production at generic commodity costs, thereby maximizing availability.  The caution here is that the price has to be high enough to defray the risks drug companies take in developing new products, many of which fail or are not profitable even if they get to market.
What is that price?  That is an empirical question.  It can also vary over time.  Let's say it's ten times the cost of developing a specific drug that is purchased by the government.  That's still going to be a lot less than the monopoly price.  And when you put a value on the lives saved by making a uniquely effective drug available, you have an economic as well as moral argument for regulation, which I believe is compelling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coal is the first step -- those companies are going bankrupt anyway. The next step is divestment from oil and gas. But climate change is not the only reason to divest from fossil fuel companies. Shell's abandoning ship in the Arctic, after only one disappointing attempt, reflects their recognition that the game has changed. The Saudis can't keep market prices up by withholding their own production. So they've switched from OPEC monopoly pricing to a new price regime: pump up the oil supply, which makes new oil exploration uneconomic. And the world economy is stagnant. So the price isn't going back up soon. Low oil prices, and speculative over-development, also affect the profitability of natural gas production, especially for frackers. The boom is now a bust. So de Blasio's move makes sense, not only for New York, but for all investors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a huge loss for Shell, and not only in money, but also credibility.  They believed their own propaganda rather than recognize the new reality.
What is the lesson to be learned?
Expensive dangerous drill-baby-drill fossil fuel energy has hit a dry hole. But the whole project was predictably unsupportable. It was doomed by the overreach in development of "unconventional oil". It was the increase of supply from the Bakken and other unconventional plays, that eroded Saudi market share at $100+ per barrel, which convinced the Saudis to abandon monopoly pricing, killing OPEC.

It's time for investors to wake up and smell the fumes -- or lack thereof.  Its time to divest from oil exploration.  The end of the bridge to nowhere is also the end of the rainbow.  And there's no pot of gold.  Only a multi-billion dollar dry hole -- under water.

<TEXT> The subject of Bernie's email note today to his supporters is "Why would Bernie go there?"  This was his answer:

 Earlier this week I spoke at Liberty University. For those of you who do not know, Liberty University is a deeply religious institution. It is a school which tries to understand the meaning of morality and the words of the Bible, within the context of a very complicated modern world. It was founded by the Reverend Jerry Falwell, and the vast majority of people at Liberty strongly disagree with me, and perhaps you, about abortion, marriage equality, and other issues.
You might be asking yourself, "Why on earth would Bernie Sanders go there?" It is a fair question within the context of our modern politics.
I spoke at Liberty University because I believe that it is important for those with different views in our country to engage in civil discourse  not just to shout at each other or make fun of each other.
It is very easy for those in politics to talk to those who agree with us  and I do that every day. It is harder, but not less important, to try and communicate with those who do not agree with us and see where, if possible, we can find common ground. In other words, to reach out of our zone of comfort.
So I went outside of my zone of comfort. Watch this video of my remarks there and read what I have to say about the ideas of morality and justice as they relate to income inequality and other critical issues facing our nation.
The message I gave at Liberty University is that the moral choice is to fight income inequality, and that the just thing to do is to work to make our society more fair. Below are some of my remarks to Liberty from the video above, but I think it is important to share them with you here as well so that you can share with others how I approach these issues.
I am far, far from a perfect human being, but I am motivated by a vision which exists in all of the great religions  Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and others  and which is so beautifully and clearly stated in Matthew 7:12. So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the prophets. The Golden Rule. Do to others what you would have them do to you. Not very complicated.
I told the crowd at Liberty University that I understand that issues such as abortion and gay marriage are very important to them, and that we disagree on those issues. I get that. But there are other issues out there that are of enormous consequence to our country and the world and that maybe, just maybe, we dont disagree on them. And maybe, just maybe, we can work together in trying to resolve them.
Amos 5:24, But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!
Justice. Treating others the way we would like to be treated. Treating all people with dignity and respect.
It would, I think, be hard for anyone in that room where I spoke to make the case that the United States today is a just society or anything resembling a just society.
In America today there is massive injustice in terms of income and wealth inequality. Injustice is rampant. We live in the wealthiest country in the history of the world but most Americans dont know that because almost all of that wealth and income is going to the top one percent. We are living at a time where a handful of people have wealth beyond comprehension  huge yachts, jet planes, tens of billions of dollars, more money than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes. But at the same time, millions of people are struggling to feed their families or put a roof over their heads or find the money to go to a doctor.
When we talk about morality and when we talk about justice, we have to understand that there is no justice when the top one-tenth of one percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. There is no justice when all over this country people are working long hours for abysmally low wages, $7.25 an hour or $8 an hour, while 58 percent of all new income being created today goes to the top one percent.
There is no justice when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires while, at the same time, the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. How can we talk about morality when we turn our backs on the children of this country? Twenty percent of the children in this country live in poverty and that includes 40 percent of African American children. There is no justice when, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, children in our country go to bed hungry.
There is no justice when the 15 wealthiest people in this country saw their wealth increase by $170 billion dollars in the last two years. That is more wealth, acquired in a two-year period, than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans. And while the very rich become much richer, millions of families have no savings at all and struggle every week just to stay alive economically, and the elderly and disabled wonder how they stay warm in the winter. That is not justice. That is a rigged economy designed by the wealthiest people in this country to benefit the wealthiest people in this country at the expense of everyone else.
There is no justice when thousands of people in America die each year because they dont have health insurance and dont get to a doctor when they should, or when elderly people are forced to choose between food or medicine because our citizens pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That is not justice. That is not morality. That is simply an indication that we are the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care for all as a right.
There is no justice when low-income and working-class mothers are forced to separate from their babies one or two weeks after birth and go back to work because we are the only major country on earth that does not have a paid family and medical leave policy. That is not justice. That is an attack on family values that everyone should be appalled at.
There is no justice in our country when youth unemployment exists at tragic levels  with 51 percent of African American high school kids unemployed or underemployed. No. We apparently do not have the funds to provide jobs or educational opportunities for our young people but we sure do have the money to throw them into jails. Today, the United States has more people in jail than any other country on earth, and many are serving time in inhumane conditions. That is not justice. That is the destruction of human life.
I am not a theologian or an expert on the Bible or a Catholic. I am just a U.S. senator from the small state of Vermont. But I agree with Pope Francis when he says: "The current financial crisis originated in a profound human crisis: the denial of the primacy of the human person! We have created new idols. The worship of the ancient golden calf has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose."
He also states: "There is a need for financial reform along ethical lines that would produce in its turn an economic reform to benefit everyone. Money has to serve, not to rule."
In his view, and I agree with him, we are living in a nation and in a world which worships the acquisition of money and great wealth, but which turns its back on those in need. And that must end. We need to move toward an economy which works for all, and not just the few.
Throughout human history there has been endless discussion and debate about the meaning of justice and the meaning of morality. I hope that by getting out of my comfort zone and speaking with the students at Liberty University that I can be a part of a dialogue with people who might not agree with us. I hope that some of them conclude that if we strive toward morality and toward justice, that it is imperative that we have the courage to stand with the poor and working people of our country.
In solidarity,
Bernie Sanders  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In the starkest sign of how unsettled the situation is, what once seemed unthinkable  that Mr. Trump could win the Republican nomination  is being treated by many within the Republican establishment as a serious possibility. And one reason his candidacy seems strong is a change by the party in hopes of ending the process earlier: making it possible for states to hold contests in which the winner receives all the delegates, rather than a share based on the vote, starting March 15, two weeks earlier than in the last cycle. Ten states have said they will do so. 
If Mr. Trump draws one-third of the Republican primary vote, as recent polls suggest he will, that could be enough to win in a crowded field. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With 41 Senators now in favor of the Iran agreement, it will not be possible to get cloture to stop debate, thus preventing continuation to a vote on the resolution of disapproval.  But this need not be an ordinary filibuster, in which debate is abandoned if the measure under discussion cannot get cloture.  Rather, it would be better for this country's democratic process for this to mark the return of the old way in which filibusters operated: discussion continues, until the Senate votes to withdraw the motion from further discussion (because it is pointless to continue).  That is not an immediate stop to debate.  It allows everyone to make their point to their Senate colleagues and to the country.  Opinions can still be changed through argument, and, if that happens, a vote may become possible.  That's what democratic process should be about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Senator Gillibrand has proven that she does not live in Chuck Schumer's shadow.  Her statement is substantive and thoughtful. Her conclusion:
 If we reject this deal, we do not have a viable alternative for preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Without a deal, and without inspectors on the ground, we will be left in the dark as Iran resumes its pursuit of a nuclear weapon, with only months to go before it could enrich enough fissile material for a bomb. Without a deal, our options will be limited to insufficient unilateral sanctions, an invasion with yet another massive and costly land war in the Middle East, or a bombing campaign that offers nothing more than short-term gain under the best-case scenario.

Compare this with [Schumer](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3ghygn/my_position_on_the_iran_deal_senator_charles_e/), who proposes extending U.S. sanctions to all nations who are not with us -- "us" being the U.S. and Israel.  Lots of luck, Chuck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When is an American not an American?  When they are Puerto Ricans living in their unrepresented homeland.  

 My message to the federal government is simple: If you continue to treat Americans living in Puerto Rico poorly, they will exercise their rights and move to the U.S. mainland, where they will immediately be entitled to equal treatment, said Pedro R. Pierluisi, Puerto Ricos nonvoting delegate in the House of Representatives...

 Puerto Ricos health care woes began in 1968, when Congress placed a cap on Medicaid in the United States territories that sharply limited the federal governments contribution.

 For Medicaid, this means that Puerto Rico typically gets $373 million a year from the federal government and has to pick up the rest of the $2.5 billion tab, Mr. Rivera of the Puerto Rico Health Care Coalition said. Last year, Oklahoma, which is wealthier than Puerto Rico, received $3 billion from the federal government, according to data compiled by the coalition. Mississippi, also not as poor as the island, received $3.6 billion.
A similar discrepancy exists with Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Puerto Ricos Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors are 40 percent lower than the mainlands, and the Medicare Advantage program is paid 60 percent of the average rate in the states </TEXT>

<TEXT> Syriza's program required a Europe that was open to new policies, that recognized the failure of austerity as a program for people.  There was no Plan B.  But Europe decided to snuff out the democratic experiment of governance by Syriza.  The Institutions EU/ECB/IMF put Greece into an economic state of siege.  And Syriza was unprepared to protect itself against its enemies.  Varoufakis' secret Plan B would have kept Greeks alive, but as outcasts from the capitalist world economy.  And no one was ready to take the place of Europe -- not Russia, not China, nor anyone else.  What is left now to do is to make an honest attempt to learn from the mistakes of Syriza's original analysis.  For Syriza's program to have had a chance, it would have required the Greek people to have voted for it on the understanding that, if the Troika is intransigent, the proud Greek people will go it alone, in poverty.  Default would then have costs that the Troika could not overlook.  And survival as a free people would have made Greece the light of the world -- like Cuba, but with individual freedom.  History does not end, but for it to move on, lessons must be learned, no matter how painful. Thessaloniki Program -- Never Again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> James K. Galbraith did careful (and covert) work for Varoufakis on what could be done for Greece to survive a continued clampdown on the banks by the Troika. Plan B is better than nothing, but very limited.  In the Troika's economic war against Greece, Greece was under siege.  Plan B would have Greeks living in a long term emergency, on short rations.  The artful workarounds of Plan B make clear that the Tsipras government does not control the banks, or other vital institutions. The state and the economy remain, for the most part, in hostile hands.  It is not surprising, therefore, that Tsipris decided to play the Alec Guinness part in Bridge Over the River Kwai: Better a managed surrender than a failed escape. The tragedy of that story is that Guinness ultimately identifies with his role of manager of the prisoners for his Japanese captors. He is a good soldier, and accepts his orders from a repellent chain of command -- anything less would be subversive.  It would be tragic if the captive Tsipras is similarly transformed.  And while Varoufakis escaped with his honor intact, he, and the other opponents of surrender in Parliament, have not been able to enlist the international support they would need to force Greece's tormentors to let go of their grip.  Merkel and Schauble and Dijsselbloem, etc. must learn that there is a price for their overreach.  But right now, they feel on top of the world. </TEXT>

The problems are deep in the system -- worldwide, not just in the U.S.  The only hope I have is through the mobilization of people who are conscious and smart, doing their own thinking, and who have the morale to keep fighting institutions dominated by wealth.  Hillary's notion of order would snuff out that uncontrolled liveliness.  My hope is that the people mobilized by Bernie will not dissipate their energies after the election, but stay together in action organizations, like 350.org and the Black Lives Matter movement.  Corporate Democrats deserve to be challenged, both within the party, and from the outside, by the Green Party, or any other independent electoral campaign that gets critical issues onto the political agenda. </TEXT>

 However, the drilling permit granted by the Interior Department on Wednesday bans Shell from drilling into oil-bearing zones until critical spill-response equipment is in place - and that equipment is aboard a damaged icebreaker en route to Oregon for repairs...

 The conditions puts further limitations on Shell's plans to open up the Arctic for oil exploration.

 An earlier decision from the Fish and Wildlife Service required Shell to keep active rigs 15 miles away from walruses and other wildlife.

 The company had initially planned to drill the wells much closer, allowing Shell to move more easily between the two sites.

 The new conditions following growing pressure from campaigners against Arctic drilling.

 Al Gore, a former vice-president, said this month that drilling for new sources of oil in the harsh conditions of the Arctic was "insane" - especially given scientists' conclusion that the majority of fossil fuels must stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change...

 So far, the company has got in one short - and disaster-prone - season of Arctic drilling, after its Kulluk rig ran aground on an island in late 2012.

Exploration and development of sites for new fossil fuel extraction can only be justified if the cost is expected to be less than existing reserves which must be used as the world transitions to renewable and non-carbon energy.  Adding in the cost of adequate protection of the environment under extreme conditions, like that in the Arctic Sea, make it clear that Shell cannot meet the economic standard for justifying its investment.  If, however, Shell can avoid paying for the environmental and climate costs of this project, it makes good economic sense to "drill baby drill". </TEXT>

If Kerry, Moniz, and the rest of the P5+1 negotiators have not significantly reduced Iran's likelihood for building a deliverable bomb during the life of the agreement, then the agreement is not worth much.  But what can the U.S. do?  It can be the only other nation, besides Israel, preventing its businesses from trading with Iran, after having given the Revolutionary Guard a huge political boost against the moderates within Iran.  It can join Israel in attacking any known nuclear capability in Iran, with a diminished capacity to discover covert nuclear development in that country in the future.  Or, it could occupy and attempt to directly govern Iran, which would give greater assurance that Iran could not build a nuclear weapon, but that effort would destroy the United States as an economic and political power in the world.  Waiting for a "better deal" with THIS Iran is not credible.  We've maximized the sanctions we have the power to mobilize.  It's downhill from here.  Why would the current regime in Iran self-depose and institute a regime we can trust?  But that seems to be the argument for why this agreement should be rejected. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tragic when capital controls are done badly, making a bad situation much worse.  This is where market mechanisms can make public policy work efficiently, minimizing bureaucracy and opportunities for corruption (and stupidity).  The primary mechanism for the equilibration of international trade balances, and to raise revenues for the state, should be through an exchange control mechanism which would prevent the leakage of s outside of Greece. Foreign exchange permits could be auctioned by the government.  Permit issuance would have to be limited to be sure that s do not exit the Greek economy faster than they re-enter, via Greek exports, or new investments in Greece.  Since Greek imports now exceed exports, the initial supply of permits would, of course, be less than the demand, and the price would rise until excess demand is choked off.  The sale of foreign exchange permits would supply the government with revenue.  Exporters should be required to repatriate earnings to Greece, or purchase foreign exchange permits for any earnings retained abroad.  Euros which are repatriated to Greece can be used to enable imports.  In effect, foreign exchange permits could be created, backed by these repatriated funds.  The private holders of the repatriated funds should receive a return for this use of their money, providing exporters with a market incentive to repatriate their euro earnings voluntarily.  The effect of this would be to add to the profit associated with the export.  It would provide a competitive advantage for Greek exporters, and therefore, tend to increase Greek exports, moving towards import-export equilibrium. The government can use some of the revenues it receives from the sale of import permits to subsidize the import of vital supplies -- imports required for the most "basic needs". For example, medicine which cannot be produced domestically, would meet this standard.  The question should be asked: "Can domestic production be substituted for the import?"  The cost of the subsidy should be explicit and regularly subject to review.  Bureaucratic decisions which are open and reviewable are the least likely to gum up the works.

<TEXT> Tsipras and the Greeks real error was in their trust that the long-term interests of the European project would prevail. They believed in solidarity, in a Europe seeking to develop its poorer parts through investment, and genuine reforms, against corruption.  Syriza could offer a new transparent law-based order because it reflected the Greek people's  rejection of the old political establishment.   Tsipras expected a good faith response.  All he got back was stonewalling and a diktat.  But it was only when he brought the Greek people into the negotiations, through the referendium, that German Europe engaged in a full-scale assault on Greek economic survival, by throttling the Greek banks.  The fact that the Greek people, nonetheless, rejected the diktat, was simultaneously a great act of courage, and of faith, that, for their fellow European, Greek Lives Matter.  They were wrong.  And now everyone knows that the tender mercies of the Chancellor will not save them.  Greece has been sacrificed, and, as the pace of the forced march picks up, if they fall behind, they will be next.  In this new order, previous sacrifices count for nothing.  And failure of Austerity to produce growth doesn't count, as long as the bonds are secure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You bullied and lectured, telling Greeks to leech themselves to health by spending less. No matter that leading international economists have long called austerity part of the problem, not part of the solution."

That the SPD dutifully followed the marching orders of the  bloodsuckers (thats what leeches do), in complete contradiction to social democratic economic theory, shows the intellectual bankruptcy of a party that has no beliefs of its own.  Up until Tsipris called a referendum, the bullying was rhetorical.  But then the gloves came off the iron fist, and the Greeks faced banking collapse, without an alternative.  And the SPD's kinder gentler rhetoric also vaporized.  The reality is that social democratic decision-making is incompatible with the higher calling of protecting profitability in a declining Europe. </TEXT>

Enforcement efforts must be robust, and never compromised by fiscal stringency. Fracking operators must pay these costs.  And enforcement agents must have incentives to stay independent, with no prospect of being captured by the regulated.  That requires total economic separation, before and after working to enforce the rule.  The assessment of adverse impacts should be an ongoing function, leading to periodic updating of the regulations.  For all these reasons, the kind of regulatory protections supported by Nocera are a mirage.  They would probe to be an inadequate defense of public health and the environment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  One issue has been access to military sites, and under the Additional Protocol the international inspectors would have access to such sites if needed. If Iran denies access, a joint commission would take no more than 24 days to review the request and, if Iran still doesnt comply, the sanctions could fall back into place.

 Administration officials have stepped back from the idea that there would be access to Irans nuclear sites anytime, anywhere, as some had declared previously.

 We dont think that anytime anywhere inspections are feasible, a senior administration official said Its just not something that happens anywhere in the world. While its a nice thing to say, it simply doesnt exist.


The question is whether an imperfect inspection regime is better or worse than no inspections.  Note that U.S. unilateral sanctions would just leave the U.S. as a non-player in the region. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Panitch's hope for a Syriza victory, however covert, appears to be wishful thinking.  Panitch seems to share Tsipris   Co.'s belief that Grexit is intolerable for the Greeks.  But without a real willingness to employ that option, Greece's leverage is limited to the pity of Europe's lending institutions.  Think of the face of Schauble.  For Greece to credibly threaten Grexit, it must do the work to make it thinkable.  It must develop the technical means for floating a credible currency that people will accept, and capital controls that are effective enough to meet vital import needs, within the limits of balanced trade (imports not greater than exports).  This is a difficult, but probably not an impossible task.  The structure must be conceived.  When the Euro curtain comes down, it will then be Syriza's task to present its alternative, and let the Greek people decide whether they are willing to take a leap for freedom, outside the grinding depression of Business As Usual.  If Grexit fails, there will be ample opportunities to surrender to German Direct Rule, and the humanitarian mercy that it offers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   a German finance ministry paper... called for Greece to be expelled from the eurozone for a minimum of five years and demanded that the Greek government transfer 50bn of state assets to an outside agency for sell-off.

The debt should be repaid by those who benefited from the obligation, in proportion to their gain.  The Greek people, who were the prime victims of the Euro gang (crony state capitalists and crimiinals) can be faulted for their gullibility and failure to overthrow the political order that was established by the West after WW II when the British suppressed the anti-Nazi resistance, importing Georgios Papandreou as Prime Minister and restoring the monarchy.  (Stalin had already agreed in Yalta that Greece was within Britain's "sphere of influence".)  Greek people have lived, ever since then, within a corrupt order that they have been too weak to overthrow.  Sadly, having justice on your side is not the same thing as having power.  The weaker a people, the more their exploitation is a temptation -- a cash cow -- and their suffering, however pitiable, is an inconvenience not worthy of much attention. Now the self-righteous winners, led by the Germans, want to expropriate whatever is left of value in Greece.  The New European Order is cold, and without shame. </TEXT>

Starting with the peaking out of the social justice accomplishments of the New Deal, in the late 1960s, there has been a steady and largely successful attack on the legitimacy of government.  As people become more cynical, and feel impotent in using government as an agency that they can employ to achieve life goals, trust in government has ebbed, and inequality has risen. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  "E.P.A. has an obligation under the Clean Air Act to develop a model federal plan, something that many states have asked E.P.A. to do so it can provide an example for states developing their own plans," said Thomas Reynolds, a spokesman for the agency. "E.P.A.'s strong preference is to approve state plans, but we know that setting out a federal plan is an important step to ensure that our Clean Air Act requirements are fulfilled."

 Environmental policy experts say that the federal government could ultimately force a policy created in Washington on the economies of each state. But that could mean the process would be extended for years.

Time for the Republican Governors to run up the Confederate flag and re-start the war against the Federal system.  The Supreme Court has already ruled that EPA has the authority to set standards and regulations under the Clean Air Act.  Unless the Republican Governors successfully secede from the Union, they will only succeed in delaying cleaner air, and add to the burden of carbon in the atmosphere, which is already changing the climate in a destructive direction.

<TEXT> Tsipris has said that a European solution is needed for Greece's problem.  It is a general repudiation of austerity as public policy. It is an inappropriate means to deal with loans which cannot be repaid.  Austerity, in fact, places all the burden on the weaker party, between countries, and within countries.  It is an attempt to force income redistribution to compensate the wealthy and powerful for the outcomes of their investment choices.  It directly tracks with the failure of growth to materialize.  At the base of this failure is a development paradigm that depends on ever-expanding demand, while cutting labor costs.  The gap between peoples' stagnant income and the assumption of growing expenditures, is filled by expanding indebtedness, with increasingly unfulfillable promises to pay.  This cannot last.  At the end of the road is a cliff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The most acute problem is, in FDR's words, "fear itself".  People will hold onto their cash, cutting their paper money spending to the minimum.  But I see nothing in the article that indicates why the banking system should collapse for transactions within Greece itself.  Checks should clear, and credit card use should be authorized -- as long as the recipient of the transaction is in Greece.  The somewhat longer term problem is purchases from abroad.  Greece now has to live with balanced trade, because credit will not be available.  Capital controls must last until real balance is established.  It must be managed much better than is currently the case if the economy is to survive.  The least bureaucratic constraint would use market mechanisms to allocate limited permits for foreign purchases.  Money earned from exports also needs to be repatriated to Greece to keep trade balanced as a revolving fund.  Market-based incentives (e.g., a premium paid to Euros entering the Greek banking system) may not be enough, if there is no trust that the money will be secure. Long term capital control policies would undoubtedly be considered in violation of Eurozone rules, and thus could be tantamount to an exit from the Euro system.  A temporary waiver of the rules by Eurozone members is the only hope of keeping Greece connected to Europe, and the world economy.  It would alleviate unnecessary suffering,  The real danger is from the animus of those whose Austerity Orthodoxy is now so deeply in crisis. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  "If necessary, we will issue parallel liquidity and California-style IOU's, in an electronic form. We should have done it a week ago," said Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister. California issued temporary coupons to pay bills to contractors when liquidity seized up after the Lehman crisis in 2008. Mr Varoufakis insists that this is not be a prelude to Grexit but a legal action within the inviolable sanctity of monetary union....

 Italy's Matteo Renzi said the sight of pensioners weeping in front of banks was a black mark on the conscience of Europe. "We must start to speak to each other again, and nobody knows this than better than Angela Merkel," he said....

 Syriza sources say the Greek ministry of finance is examining options to take direct control of the banking system if need be rather than accept a draconian seizure of depositor savings - reportedly a 'bail-in' above a threshhold of 8,000 - and to prevent any banks being shut down on the orders of the ECB....

 Government officials recognize that this would lead to an unprecedented rift with the EU authorities. But Syriza's attitude at this stage is that their only defence against a hegemonic power is to fight guerrilla warfare.

<TEXT> The problem with extreme wealth is that it is too easy to use the concentrated power it confers to game the system -- directly through economic power, and indirectly through control of the state.  Eventually all the chips are yours, and several hundred other folk who you know, and respect, and who are in the same game as you: being topmost at the game of "winner take all". The whole world is your oyster -- suck out the value, and discard the shells.  As the rest of us play the only game available -- a complex system we can't control -- our bargaining position weakens.  We get poorer to stay "competitive".  And more afraid to buck the powers that be.  We elect corrupt politicians who promise to ease the pain, but only add to our dependency, because the system, whose logic turns us into losers, cannot be touched.  It is sacred.  But sometimes desperate people lose their fear.  That is what happened in Greece when Syriza was elected. That is dangerous to the system and must be crushed. And that's what connects the billionaires to what's happening now in Greece. Syriza will be discredited because, ultimately, Tsipris doesn't believe that Greece can go it alone.  He sounds an uncertain trumpet, and the people are confused.  And that will discredit the electoral anti-austerity movement everywhere.  Then people will only be left with demonstrations, art, and impotent acts of destruction to express their rage.  We need a better game to play. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Capital flows is like water. It's not possible to dam the whole Amazon.  But it is possible to channel the flow, if you're not simpleminded in approaching the issue.  Greece needs some essentials from abroad, like pharmaceuticals.  But there is a lot of discretionary spending that must be reduced to what Greece can afford (i.e., = to what it earns from exports).  It can't afford to bleed capital.  But people need to be able to spend on international goods.  Who decides on what people can buy from abroad?  "Committee of Transactions Approval/ State General Accounting Office" is one way.  That certainly portends disaster. But there are ways to restrict capital flow that minimize bureaucracy. After allowing foreign exchange for essentials, a market mechanism could be employed to auction the remaining foreign exchange as permits.  The income generated from such auctions could be used to support basic income for all Greeks.  Setting up such a system is not instant, but it should be fast enough to give people confidence that there is a self-determined Greek solution to this problem.  It's the first step towards building a real economy, capable of paying legitimate debts. No one thought that getting beyond the grip of the Troika would be easy. I hope the Greeks tread this dangerous path wisely. </TEXT>

German domination might not have been built in initially to the European order, but Germany has surely emerged as the hegemon of the Euro system, as poorer, less productive countries have slipped into debt dependency, inevitably losing their sovereignty in the process.  Meanwhle the stronger economies have gained.  As long as the pie was growing, all this seemed like a fair bargain.  But post-2008 the leash of dependency is a tightening noose.  Debts incurred on the assumption of continuous high growth now can't be paid.  The best course for Greece is to find other sources of capital and know-how, while maintaining market access to Europe.  Turkey, and other growing economies, may be better partners to develop Greece's economic potential.

Greece, and now Puerto Rico, show that Business As Usual is no longer possible. The only hope for creditors is a successful Puerto Rican economy, which is not further weakened by debt repayment.  Greece has shown that "bailouts" that only save creditors, while worsening the debt burden are bound to fail.  A new path is needed, based on sound governance -- both in the public sector and private economy -- and an understanding that punitive responses to failed prospects hurt everyone.  Creditors who acted in good faith should get a long term return as revenues from economic growth make that possible.

So how was the Confederacy's raison-d'etre transformed into the argument used by those who glorify the Southern cause in The War Between the States: that the secession was a defense of Southern Culture -- a Don't-Tread-on-Me defense of liberty?

https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/grc/

But its export potential is much higher than has been realized. See:http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/economic_paper/2014/pdf/ecp518_en.pdf
This EU report identifies the need to rationalize the Greek economy. It notes that the ability to attract investment is not primarily a function of knocking down labor costs:

The competitiveness of a country cannot be summarised exhaustively by labour productivity and wage per employee, i.e. unit labour cost. Instead, competitiveness depends crucially on a more comprehensive notion of the cost of doing business  which in turn depends on the rule of law, property rights, the ability to enforce contracts, flexible labour market arrangements, the available transport infrastructure and many other factors besides the recorded cost of capital and labour. Customs formalities, administrative procedures, and regulatory transparency are directly linked to the trading process. All of these factors can impact trade performance through the cost channel.

But the Troika demands only see "the cost of doing business" and ignore the rest of society as if it is of no value. What rankles is that the Troika program unnecessarily sacrifices the needs of most of the Greek people in order to make production less costly.
A self-governing people can achieve much of the efficiency goal of the Troika at a fraction of the human cost. That is what the Tsipris government has been trying to demonstrate in its counter-offers. And it has been totally rebuffed.
If Greece were free to act in its own best interests, it would cut out crony state-capitalist niches that siphon away the fruits of the peoples labor and ingenuity. Then non-EU capital-rich countries and regions (U.S., China, petrodollar holders) might find Greece a good place to invest in.
A sovereign Greece, free to choose its partners, will be bad news for the present regime in Germany. They will discover that their sphere of influence has shrunk, and that the German dominated EU has cut its Greek nose to spite its Euro face. Extending credit to its weaker members has been the elixir keeping the German economy buoyant. Germany, unable to recognize the dual nature of the debt relationship, has now killed that goose, and there will be no more golden eggs. No one will want to be in Greece's shoes with respect to the German financiers. That ends the false promise -- the mirage of prosperity -- that sustained the Euro. If Germany must go back to the Mark. it will discover that inequality is eventually self-limiting. The Mark will appreciate, and German goods, no matter how superior, will be unaffordable. Switzerland already has that problem, which is only masked by the inflow of loot from all nations, willing to pay for sanctuary in Swiss banks.

<TEXT> As Greece is forced into the real economy -- probably through Grexit -- it's time to start looking at the numbers. Greece's trade deficit on goods is about $27 billion a year: Products exported by Greece: $33.8B, Products imported by Greece: $60.5B

But its export potential is much higher than has been realized. See: http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/economic_paper/2014/pdf/ecp518_en.pdf

<TEXT>  I come to a figure of a cumulative hit on the level of GDP of 12.6 per cent over four years. The Greek debt-to-GDP ratio would start approaching 200 per cent. My conclusion is that the acceptance of the troika's programme would constitute a dual suicide  for the Greek economy, and for the political career of the Greek prime minister. 
... Grexit, of course, has pitfalls, mostly in the very short term. A sudden introduction of a new currency would be chaotic. The government might have to impose capital controls and close the borders. Those year-one losses would be substantial, but after the chaos subsides the economy would quickly recover. Comparing those two scenarios reminds me of Sir Winston Churchills remark that drunkenness, unlike ugliness, is a quality that wears off.  </TEXT>

American power to impose its order on the world is proving to be a mirage, that just leads us on into wars we cannot win, and are afraid to admit that we have lost.  We are now losing the fight against ISIS -- the newest expression of barbarism arising from mass desperation.  Rejecting the wrong track -- the one leading us back into Iraq -- is a crucial message.

<TEXT> It is confusing,and deliberately so.  The House voted on a three-part bill sent to them from the Senate.  The first part, Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) was supposed to be the sweetener that would allow Democrats to support Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) or Fast Track authority. The third part provides penalties for currency manipulation by trade partners, and easily passed by a vote of 240 to 190.  The surprise in the vote was that TAA lost overwhelmingly, when most Democrats failed to swallow the bait, and, nonetheless, TPA passed by 2 votes, including a vital 28 Democrats.  The failure of TAA meant that the House did not pass the Senate bill, in whole.  Therefore the process must be restarted.  This is where we stand now, with Obama corporate Dems, and Republicans, scrambling to get enough votes changed to get TAA passed, so that Obama can sign a completed bill. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The new investment policy was approved unanimously by Norway's finance committee and will be formally adopted by parliament on 5 June. It requires the fund, founded on Norway's vast oil wealth, to exclude companies earning more than 30% of their revenues from coal or producing more than 30% of their electricity from coal.

While Norway still continues to generate its wealth by extracting oil, this decision is not based on moral purity. It is a business decision based on the-world-will-save-itself scenario.  In that case, the world must constrain carbon emissions, even as it still uses some fossil fuels in the transition to a carbon-free future.  Norway's oil is cheap enough to get used, even if it must pay a carbon tax (set at a rate that assures carbon emissions are limited to a safe level).  The alternative scenario is the-world-is-too-greedy-to-save-itself.  In that case, climate destabilization will make rational economic planning futile.  You can't even be sure that Norway's North Sea oil reserves will be extractable.  Conceptually, a nation has the advantage over a business in making long-run decisions, because it cannot get away from itself.  It is stuck where it is  -- land, people, culture.  Continuity matters, as it does with real people, (unlike profit-maximizing capital decisions). </TEXT>

 Once an anti-austerity movement coalesces around Sanders, the movement will rapidly assume a half-in, half-out posture towards the DP

 ... if, as we believe, the DP establishment defeats the Sanders' campaign for nomination ... it can bring a wealth of experience in organizing and coordinating a large scale, national electoral operation in service to independent campaigns that are already in full swing, most likely the Green Party.

In exchange for the tax breaks, Glenwood set aside 459 units, a relatively low 15 percent, of the 2,987 apartments for low- and moderate-income households, according to city records and an analysis by the Association for Neighborhood Housing Development.

So the tax break was worth over $1.5 million per apartment.  One national estimate of the cost of building a unit in an apartment house is $64,575 - $86,100 (861 square feet with a footprint of 24'x35')
http://www.fixr.com/costs/build-apartment
Of course, NYC construction costs are higher.  There's union labor, and congestion costs getting materials to the site, and higher land cost, even in the outer boroughs.  But, most of all, graft and gross profits can really drive up the cost of affordable housing.

<TEXT>  this little-known provision in the tax code, known as a like-kind exchange, has become a popular tactic for a new niche of investors: buyers of high-end art who want to put off - and sometimes completely avoid - federal taxes ... The exchanges have become prevalent enough, and the cost to the government significant enough, that the Obama administration is seeking to eliminate them, a prospect causing no shortage of alarm in sectors of the art world...  Lawmakers in Washington, meanwhile, are receiving phone calls and letters from the growing corps of like-kind exchange advisers in opposition to eliminating the exchanges.
Experts say the use of the tax break has expanded in response to surging prices for art and the rising number of savvy investors, often veterans of the real estate industry or Wall Street, who have come to view paintings and sculptures as tradable commodities.

What is "high-end art" really worth? The answer appears to depend on how much of your tax obligation you can avoid, as you bid up its price.
It will be interesting to see who among our legislators will justify continuing this tax scam.

<TEXT> Consider tactical voting. That means that if you live in a clearly Red or Blue state, you can vote your conscience, and send a message.  On the other hand, if you live in a "battleground" state, the stakes are higher.  For myself (someone who is addicted to voting), if I lived in a battleground state, I'd probably hold my nose and vote lesser-evil.  But for anyone in a battleground state who can't stand voting for Hillary, vote Green (or another party that conforms to your beliefs).  Your vote would not change the outcome of the contest, but it is a vote against cynicism, which is the big-time ally of entrenched power. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I support Bernie Sanders' run in the Democratic primary because it's the only way that the public can be reached to get engaged in the real issues that he raises.  The danger of the move, however, is to bring another generation of movement activists into the Democratic Party, the way that Jesse Jackson did in 1988.  The DP is an institutional roach motel for progressives.  You enter at great peril to your integrity.  I am registered as a Democrat to vote in primaries in NYC.  But I vote Green Party, which, in New York has a  line on the ballot as long as it gets 50,000+ votes for Governor.  As its candidate for President, Jill Stein did a great job raising issues.  But the audience is still small.  I hope that the Green base will grow as people who support Bernie look around for a long-term base for talking and acting politically.  In the U.S. electoral system a vote for Green Party may turn an election in a perverse direction. In 2000 the Florida vote for Ralph Nader, if it had gone for Al Gore, would have given Gore a clear victory in Florida, which would have made him President.  I have supported "strategic" voting in the Presidential election.  That would mean that small progressive parties would not contest in close states, but would campaign actively in both "red" (Republican) and "blue" (Democratic) states.  That would let the message and organization develop.  This is not an elegant position.  It is an acknowledgement that a progressive program does not have enough support now to take the Presidency.  But I hope that the Sanders run will help reveal a broader base of support for a progressive program than anyone anticipated.  Being part of an independent institutional structure that is participatory and democratic (i.e., not the Democratic Party) is necessary for a new movement to grow with integrity.  Bernie's integrity is unimpeachable precisely because he never had to be a DP loyalist.  I hope that the next generation of radicalized Americans follow the same path, and prevails. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You may be right about the EU.  I myself am not a social democrat but a libertarian socialist.  That's as close to anarchist as you can get while recognizing that capitalism has fatal flaws (speculation and bubbles are built into the DNA).  A cooperative libertarian society strives for decentralization, with as little structure as we can get away with.  But what structure is needed is a social construction that must be democratically decided on.  The sustainable society of the 21st century, if it is to happen at all, must minimize waste.  That means high utilization of resources.  Public goods like parks vs. lawns, transit (including smart taxi options and car-sharing) vs. multiple private cars, etc. are what we need.  But for that to feel desirable means that sharing must not be Procrustean.  We are now close to having a technology to implement freedom and cooperation without paying the lion's share of our effort to the .01% whose claims of indispensability  have proven to be a consumer fraud.  They hijacked decision-making on what gets produced and how. Their claims of entitlement to that power must be questioned, and, just perhaps, rejected.  A culture of participatory democracy is the only possible alternative to unsustainable capitalism or unbearable bureaucratic collectivism.  It requires staying involved and open, and not trusting others to do your thinking for you.  Creating that culture is worth fighting for.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The American standard of living is doomed in a world where multinational corporations are the only recognized stakeholders. They get to know the rules that will be imposed by the TPP (and the other treaties that will be based on it) before the governments do, because their "experts" are on the drafting committees.  Unions did not drive manufacturing out of the U.S.  They were just too weak to hold back the exodus to countries with cheap wages, and low health and environmental standards.

Sometime after U.S. economic well-being peaked in the early 1970s, people bought the line that the government is the problem. And this is the result of the ensuing politics -- a government beholden to business, without the internal morale to govern properly. Dedicated public service is viewed as a quaint notion, not to be taken seriously. It didn't have to be this way.

Many Americans now anticipate that their children will do worse than they have. They do not see how the stagnating standard of living of the lower 90% can even be sustained. Unless it is supported by real production, the American standard of living is, indeed, not sustainable. 

The American Way of Life can be maintained only temporarily, through the use of our previously accumulated wealth and power, which we are currently expending to support consumption greater than the value of what we produce. The fearful majority, who propelled the Republicans' 2014 election victory, understand that the U.S. still remains an attractive place to make a living. But what does America produce that cannot be produced elsewhere cheaper? Primarily (1) stuff that must be made or done here to be sold here, in this still rich country -- retail, houses, hands-on healthcare, etc.; (2) resource-based industries -- principally agriculture and fossil fuel production; (3) the military-industrial complex, whose costs have become too expensive to bear as America's overall economic body weakens; (4) high-end technology, which quickly gets manufactured elsewhere (iPhone, etc.); and (5) financial and managerial services, which have been growing as the real economy stagnates, propped up by the dollar as the prime global currency. 

American military power is key to keeping superpower privilege intact. Why else should capital markets, and the lucrative financial services industry they support, remain based here, even as the center of gravity for global economic activity moves east to Asia? 

Now added to this mix are the shale oil and fracking boom, which are being sold as the fountain of revitalization for manufacturing. This is in total contradiction to our long term interest in combating climate change.  The policy contest on this issue is heating up, and is not going away. On the one side is the need to confront the emerging climate disaster revealed by science, in a world increasingly beyond the grasp of American control. On the other side is a deep ideology that believes in American exceptionalism, and must increasingly deny reality in order to keep its confidence up. Delusions of grandeur --belief in a divine right to continued dominance -- are the hardest of illusions to break. 

Capitalism is a system designed to reward winners. Losers are a "social problem". The real question is whether most people, being economically unnecessary, will continue to be fed. To the extent that the society rejects social answers to social problems, we are in trouble.

The world has limited resources, and limited ability of the environment to absorb the unconsumable byproducts of production (global warming is just one aspect of this). Reality presents threatening questions, and the political class offers no real answers. As of yet, no one on the political stage is pointing our attention towards a modest but humanly acceptable future. It's time to call for a new script and new players on stage to surprise and awaken us back to living the possible life.

Bernie Sanders points in the right direction.  He's too radical for business-as-usual America.  He talks about the real world.  But his Keynesian solutions are not radical enough to reconstruct America along sustainable lines.  I plan to volunteer in his campaign so that I can help start the conversation we need, once we start asking the right questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Growth of inequality is the product of a game whose rules are set by the winners.  If the game were fair, inequality would stabilize, reflecting the rewards needed to elicit efforts.  Are the efforts that are receiving increasing rewards for the winners becoming more onerous or risky? Probably not.
Rather, the winners have the power to withhold their money from use. It may earn nothing. But it is not lost forever like time, nor does it have to eat.  With no bargaining power, labor's share of the national product has fallen to an historic low. Increasing inequality no longer can be justified as the price we have to pay for a prosperous economy for everyone. The magic of the market is not working. Increasing inequality means lack of sustainable final demand.  The crisis of the market is summed up by the question: Investment in what?  Instead of real progress, we're getting bubbles, stagnation, and competitive currency devaluations. Something new is needed. How about investing in climate resilience (and minimizing further climate damage)? We'd be a lot better off that way than we will be otherwise, globally. But there is no private market mechanism that will take us there. Climate change, resource limits, globalized production are the background conditions. We cannot afford waste -- neither of resources, nor of people. There is more than enough work that needs to be done. We need a fresh perspective and a political sea change.

<TEXT> As usual, David Brooks marshals information to prove that the problems of the poor are the result of their own cultural deficits:
 The problem is not lack of attention, and its not mainly lack of money. 
...
 But the real barriers to mobility are matters of social psychology, the quality of relationships in a home and a neighborhood that either encourage or discourage responsibility, future-oriented thinking, and practical ambition.

Differences in power never enter Brooks' mind as a factor in how well people do in life.
What's needed in Baltimore and elsewhere is a process which rebuilds communities with a vision in mind -- sustainability in the world of the 21st century.  Climate change, resource limits, globalized production are the background conditions.  What we know now, that can let us start to build for the future, is that we cannot afford waste -- neither of resources, nor of people.  There is more than enough work that needs to be done.  Skills must be developed.  And people must be involved in a realistic conversation about what is possible in a post-consumerist world, where we must share public spaces convivially.  Cities are needed.  They must be desirable places to live -- not hellholes for the dispossessed. 
When people have channels to work for desired goals, they become capable of working together -- even as the Bloods and the Crips came together to form the thin line of sanity separating an enraged tormented population from their tormentors.  The peace they created is the precondition for justice. But without justice, no peace can hold. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The views of older voters deserve scrutiny. They worry that redistribution will come at their expense, in particular via cuts to Medicare, 

What will it take to convince people that greater economic justice can be achieved without harming "middle class" people whose heads are barely above water?  

What's needed first is a public educator who can explain why inequality has ballooned since the 1970s -- the same period in which the "Great Society" welfare state came under attack, and income was shifted from wages to profits.  

The business-friendly state since the '70s has focused on "incentives to invest", produced an economy overwhelmed by its speculative financial sector, and hollowed out the guts of the productive economy.  

As America's economic strength recedes, people who are still afloat think that they'll sink further if they try to save  anyone else.

Until someone (Bernie Sanders? Elizabeth Warren?) raises the bigger question of economic direction, the call for increased social-economic justice will seem like dangerous liberal do-goodism.  </TEXT>

Trade deals which are written by corporate "stakeholders" are bound to tilt the game in their favor, even if they claim to "address" concerns about working conditions, the environment, health, etc.  Until there is a democratic process, no deal is better than a contract that we blindly sign.  Making the rules of trade is a process, and it has been hijacked.  They're at the controls, threatening to crash the system unless we click "I Agree".  That is the death of democracy.

In other words, there is a point of diminishing returns, and then absolute loss, associated with applying pressure on a debtor country.  It does not add to discipline over the others if even one country slips out of the net of control.  This is not a threat but an analytical statement.

<TEXT> What Greece needs is basic rations for a humanitarian crisis -- the food, medicine, energy, and technology it needs to  sustain its people through an emergency.  That should not be subject to threat.  Greece must not be strangled.  After that it becomes possible to negotiate, and build a sustainable economic future, not only for Greece, but for Europe as well.  The gun-at-your-head ultimatum offered by Europe makes the worst of a bad situation -- for everyone, except for the speculators who bought Greek debt for dimes on the dollar, and hope to be repaid in Greek blood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He who the gods would destroy they first drive mad.  Netanyahu has taken unquestioned American support of Israel as an entitlement.  He thought he could force American backing for Israeli policy in Iran -- a policy which is geared to start a war, which America would be compelled to fight -- to save Israel.  Now it is clear that Netanyahu has crossed the line,  Israel can no longer base its bragadocio on its certainty that the U.S. will come to the rescue, no matter what.  Democrats, who have been the object of Netanyahu's contempt for years, are learning that they need not be afraid.  They are learning to just say no.  Enough is enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Varoufakis is a game-changer.  The question is-- can he sell his new game in which debt-holders' interests are linked to the success of the real economy of Greece.  To make the new game credible, Syriza has to be credible itself.  It must have the power to successfully confront and replace Greece's longstanding corrupt political-economic establishment.  Because if they stay with their power and interests intact, nothing productive will be built, and Greece will remain pauperized. A desperate Greek people have shown themselves willing to bet on Syriza to win this fight.  Varoufakis now has the trickier job of proving to the European financial establishment that they should give Syriza the chance it is asking for -- to throw the Greek oligarchs off the boat.  That might save the Greek people, and give the best return possible on the Greek debt that the troika holds.  But it would be a breach of class solidarity in the club of rulers.  Which side are they on? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What if Greece establishes the New Drachma as a dual currency which would be the required means of payment for the portion of taxes 
budgeted for domestic spending?  

The supply and price of ND would initially be set by the State to be equivalent to one year of  revenue, but then would  be determined by supply and demand as recipients of ND converted them to s to the extent required  to make  other purchases.  ND would be legal tender for all domestic payments at the current exchange rate with s.

The initial distribution of ND would take two forms -- sale of ND for s to cover taxes and as payment for domestic government obligations.

The government could issue or retire ND based on revenue needs and the value of the currency.  

The objectives of this course of action would be (1) to align government expenses with domestic  revenue sources; and (2) to maximize the employment of domestic resources -- which would accept payment in ND while external sellers would probably not be willing to take the currency risk without receiving a larger risk premium.

Assuming that the ND depreciates relative to , then the price of Greek goods would decline relative to the price of international goods.

The real drawdown of externally held debt would not begin until Greece establishes a balance of payments surplus.

The long term direction of the Greek economy can be as the leading edge of a sustainable Europe in a world in which material growth will be increasingly limited by resource constraints and the need to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

A progressive democratic state is the prerequisite for pushing such a program. 

A Sustainable Reconstruction program must be based on recognition that the efficient use of limited material resources will require a shift away from competitive consumption (with its increasingly unequal distribution of wealth) and towards meeting most  needs with public goods that engender strong engagement, starting at the community level. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the Saudis have so far refused to curb production to prop up prices. Its not clear yet how far OPEC is willing to let prices slide. The U.A.E.s energy minister said on Dec. 14 that OPEC wouldnt trim production even if prices fall to $40 a barrel.

I find it interesting to consider how long-term limits on fossil fuel production, to forestall the worst ravages of climate change, provide a context for understanding Saudi Arabia's  decision to let the market sink in a flood of cheap product.  I hope that the Saudi action may provide the kind of disruption that allows for fresh thinking, and a post-crisis re-configuration of the energy market.

The Saudis seem committed to continue producing full-tilt, as long as their low-cost supply lasts.

I think that one motive for the Saudis' market decision may be as a response to their increasing certainty that restrictions on carbon emissions will come.

High energy prices have been based on Saudi self-restraint, limiting supply in order to keep prices high. That has reduced Saudi market share, but that loss has been more than compensated by increased economic rent per barrel (i.e. market price minus production cost).

The Saudis may understand that they are now in a "use it, or lose it" situation with respect to oil as an economic resource.  Expanding their market share,  despite the immediate impact on price, then becomes a rational profit-maximizing strategy.

The current low price is not the end of the story.  Current high-cost producers will not re-invest as their existing wells are depleted.  That will eliminate the current glut, stabilizing oil prices.  As demand increases, more expensive oil will be tapped, and the price will rise again, but Saudi existing capacity, at that higher price, will be the first to fill that higher demand.  That is because their cost for expanding production will, in general, be less than the cost of developing new production elsewhere.

Thus the Saudi play to crash oil prices should inhibit new investment in the development of expensive unconventional fossil fuel for a long time to come.  Even when prices rebound somewhat, projected future prices will have been ratcheted down, because Saudi forbearance can no longer be expected.

This speaks directly to the business case for divestment in fossil fuel companies.

Here's a few recent articles along this line of thinking:

  Does Keystone XL make sense as oil prices fall?
  http://m.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy-Voices/2015/0116/Does-Keystone-XL-make-sense-as-oil-prices-fall#unhide

  Stanford faculty members call for fossil fuel divestment - full letter
  (Letter signed by 295 faculty members calls on US university to pull out of all fossil fuel investments)
  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2015/jan/11/stanford-fossil-fuel-divestment-letter

  Axa IM warns that companies linked to fossil fuels risk their reputations: Climate risk is becoming `synonymous with reputation risk' as a growing fossil fuel divestment movement gains traction with investors around the world, says major European investor Axa IM
  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/15/axa-warns-companies-linked-fossil-fuel-risk-reputations

So the question becomes: what is the business case for investment in a sustainable future when the immediate (and unsustainable) price of fossil fuels is so low?

The perspective of investors must shift from quick returns, which sharply discount future consequences.  That mode of thinking is consonant with high interest rates.  Those high rates embody the implicit assumption that the future will take care of itself:  there will be enough growth to pay off any adverse consequences arising from current activities.

That perspective has been dead since the dotcom bust of 1999.  Attempts at re-floating investor confidence have kindled property bubbles, even in China.

It's time for the mass of world capital to wake up to its new task: preparing the planet for people to live successfully within material limits.  It is a huge task.  Failure by the political class to do its part in securing the path forward makes investment riskier.  But keeping blinders on is not a rational alternative.  If the Saudis can face a carbon-constrained future, so can other investors, once they see that there is no other alternative.  If the current managers of capital cannot credibly manage that capital, then that role will be forfeited by them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> RWV is a model for diligent advocacy work. Open the attachment to see the level of specificity needed to effectively advocate for patients under ACA.  The same level of scrutiny and sensitivity to the effect of rules on people would be needed even if Single Payer were in effect.  Without ACA or another comprehensive government program, like Single Payer, the issues raised by RWV would still exist, but there would be no place to turn to address those issues.  The free market, by itself,   cannot resolve this level of complexity efficiently.  That is because we, as consumers, are often presented with major health need decisions which must be made without "shopping" -- i.e., we are perishable, and can't wait for full information.  That is why the provision of vital health services is inherently a public good, and why a well-informed and active civil society is critical in making any public service work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is the Saudi strategic agenda in crashing the price of oil? As the low-cost producer they will survive and continue to pump out their reserve, while undercutting all of their geopolitical rivals as well as economic competitors -- principally Iran and Russia. They will make fracking, deepwater, and tar sand extraction bad investments, not only immediately, but even after the price goes back up, because SA has demonstrated its power to impose disastrous risk on these high-cost operations. But there is a deeper strategy that I believe may be operating as well. If the world's major powers -- China, EU, and eventually the U.S. -- recognize that earthbound carbon must remain sequestered in the ground, then there is no value for SA in holding its reserves in reserve for future use, say, post 2050. They have a direct interest in spewing it forth while there's still a market, even at a discount price. And once they've broken the unconventional extraction industry, the price can go back up without eliciting new supplies -- a win-win for the Saudis. For long-term economic as well as environmental stability, this is the time to impose a carbon tax. It would keep energy prices at a level that people and businesses are used to paying, and provide the funds needed to build out the new economy that must replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, and meet a myriad of other resource constraints that cannot be efficiently addressed by market forces alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The police have an impossible job defending the property and consciences of the protected class (most of us -- more than the 1% who are inexorably taking all of our marbles, but definitely excluding those whose communities are already dispossessed of hope).  The cops job is to quarantine the unpleasant dysfunctional reality of the resulting contagious social disease.  And they become infected.  The mindset of an occupying army becomes more brutalized over time, because the underlying conditions do not go away.  And, increasingly, their actions shock the conscience of those who they are actually trying to protect. Some of us even denounce the police, say "not in our name".  But that will remain a hypocritical protest until we, the protected, turn our guilty consciences into changing what we want.  Subjugation and oppression work for a while. Simon Legree whipped slaves to death to serve as an example -- to instill terror. But that kind of "law and order" is not sustainable. It is bringing the endless war home, and only one thing is certain: no one will win. A libertarian vision must finally understand that the unconditional defense of property under conditions of injustice creates the police state that threatens all of us.   So, what to do? Only attending to all the cries can rest the vengeful urge in mourning's peace. Repeat in your own words what the other is saying, until you understand it.

<TEXT> I believe that the rejection of the reality of climate change, and the fetishizing of fossil fuel production as the elixir for American world power, have even deeper roots than discussed by Klare in his analysis documenting the connection between the fossil fuel industry and the Republican Party.
Rational energy companies are hedging their bets. See: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/business/energy-environment/nrg-sets-goals-to-cut-carbon-emissions.html
They recognize the growing divestment movement. See: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/us/harvard-students-move-fossil-fuel-divestment-fight-to-court.html
On the other hand, Republican obstruction asserts a story that its base supporters want to hear to reassure them that American power will be restored, fulfilling their thwarted American dreams.
Many Americans, not only Republicans, now anticipate that their children will do worse than they have. They do not see how the stagnating standard of living of the lower 90% can even be sustained.
Unless it is supported by real production, the American standard of living is, indeed, not sustainable.  The American Way of Life can be maintained only temporarily, through the use of our previously accumulated wealth and power, which we are currently expending to support consumption greater than the value of what we produce.
The fearful majority, who propelled the Republicans' recent election victory, understand that the U.S. still remains an attractive place to make a living.  But what does America produce that cannot be produced elsewhere cheaper? Primarily (1) stuff that must be made or done here to be sold here, in this still rich country -- retail, houses, hands-on healthcare, etc.;  (2) resource-based industries -- principally agriculture and fossil fuel production; (3) the military-industrial complex, whose costs have become too expensive to bear as America's overall economic body weakens; (4) high-end technology, which quickly gets manufactured elsewhere (iPhone, etc.);  and (5) financial and managerial services, which have been growing as the real economy stagnates, propped up by the dollar as the prime global currency.
American military power is key to keeping superpower privilege intact. Why else should capital markets, and the lucrative financial services industry they support, remain based here, even as the center of gravity for global economic activity moves east to Asia?
Now added to this mix are the shale oil and fracking boom, which are being sold as the fountain of revitalization for manufacturing.
So the policy contest on this issue is heating up, and is not going away.  On the one side is the need to confront the emerging climate disaster revealed by science, in a world increasingly beyond the grasp of American control.  On the other side is a deep ideology that believes in American exceptionalism, and must increasingly deny reality in order to keep its confidence up.
Delusions of grandeur --belief in a divine right to continued dominance -- are the hardest of illusions to break.
The world has limited resources, and limited ability of the environment to absorb the unconsumable byproducts of production (global warming is just one aspect of this).
Reality presents threatening questions, and the political class offers no real answers.
As of yet, no one on the political stage is pointing our attention towards a modest but humanly acceptable future.
It's time to call for a new script and new players on stage to surprise and awaken us back to living the possible life. </TEXT>

The Department of Labor (DOL) is expanding and strengthening immigration options for victims of crimes (U visas) and trafficking (T visas) who cooperate in government investigations.  An interagency working group will also explore ways to ensure that workers can avail themselves of their labor and employment rights without fear of retaliation.

This policy can be aggressively used to reduce illegal immigration in the future.  It appears to allow undocumented workers who have been the victim of crimes by their employers, such as wage theft, to turn to the legal system for redress, and for the first time be eligible for "immigration options for victims of crimes" which should protect them from deportation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My comment to the FCC: The internet -- the information superhighway -- must be open to all users at the same speed.  We understand that the infrastructure that is the medium of telecommunication must be paid for.  But users already pay their internet service provider.  ISPs form a network that must be integrated, like the electrical grid. Final distribution to users is often a monopoly, and therefore must be regulated as a utility.  No benefit is served by establishing a regime where monopolistic carriers of data can establish discriminatory conditions as to price or speed of service.  A proper regulatory structure is needed to assure that overall system capacity is sufficient to provide the level of service that people are paying for.
I urge you to use your Title II authority, to declare that internet providers  are common carriers, who cannot prioritize who gets served and who gets stranded..

<TEXT>  The new goal of an 80% reduction puts NYC at the forefront of sustainability in cities nationwide, said Russell Unger, the executive director of the Urban Green Council, an environmental nonprofit.
Theres no question that this is the destination we need to get to and there are very few governments of any level that have recognized that, he said.
Mr. Unger said he hoped the legislation would lead to a boom in environmentally friendly construction in the city.
Fossil fuels are dead, he said. And our buildings75% of the citys carbon consumptionwill be going on a serious diet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This treats homelessness as a human waste disposal problem. The deeper problem is the functioning of the body politic that is, at an increasing rate, excreting the homeless as its waste product.  Our economic system is focused on eliminating waste to maximize profits (labeled "staying competitive").  No one has the job of seeing what people need, and producing it, if they don't have money.  The moral standard is a practical one: The less you care about other people, the better off you are.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nursegate.  Christie's (and Cuomo's) fear play has boomeranged.  Hysteria in power leads to the use of excessive force.  States have the inherent police power to quarantine anyone who is a threat to public health.  But that is not a license to round up people and detain them on vague suspicion.  That's not due process.  That is an appeal to mass fear.  What is needed is a public health system capable of identifying people at risk, and then providing close surveillance and management of each case.  That costs public money -- i.e., tax money -- and politicians avoid that like the plague.

<TEXT> This approach, which bypasses climate change as the rationale for carbon pricing, would take us a long way towards establishing the architecture of incentives needed to switch into a low carbon-emissions economy.  More is needed.  An even higher price for carbon, over time, would require explicit acknowledgement that this it is being done to combat climate change.  And more will have to be done beyond the capacity of the market to handle -- regulatory and policy frameworks that support our move towards a sustainable relationship between the planet and its peoples.  Carbon pricing is necessary, and it is a good place to start acting locally, even before we understand how to think globally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 19th Century, when the germ theory replaced the sin theory as the explanation for disease, there was a revolution in the public sphere, where respectable people understood the need to not let the poor become the vectors for the spread of disease to the more fortunate classes. Public health, starting with a safe water supply, became a major government responsibility, for which people were willing to pay taxes, and even have some of their property rights regulated. Over the last forty years or so that awareness has gotten lost. That's when homelessness in the U.S. went from a rarity to an ever-present population who most of us avert our eyes from seeing. And now that vast unseen population of vulnerable people may subvert any possibility of tracking and containing deadly infectious diseases like ebola. The moral foundations of human decency are, in fact, practical. We are responsible for the long run consequences of our actions. If we fail to give a damn, here and now, the conditions which support our daily lives will disappear. Public health -- your health -- cannot be maintained when other people fall below the minimum standards for healthy living. And, with ebola, we see that that principle applies globally. Is health care a right? Only if you think you have a right to life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like Tiananmen, there is overwhelming support in the city for democracy.  The police can let gangs attack isolated demonstrators.  But the attackers can be overwhelmed by people arriving en masse to save the day.  Social media is the new element that empowers solidarity, allowing for rapid mobilization to counter surprise attacks.  Of course, China can bring in troops from the provinces to crush any local population.  But mass repression is not stability -- witness Syria.  The hope in China is that the system is not one-man-rule.  China is complex. There are economic forces whose future depend on the rule of law, and consent of the governed.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> thoughts from a disposable man, and health policy maker

  My father illustrates the situation well. About a decade ago, just shy of his 77th birthday, he began having pain in his abdomen. Like every good doctor, he kept denying that it was anything important. But after three weeks with no improvement, he was persuaded to see his physician. He had in fact had a heart attack, which led to a cardiac catheterization and ultimately a bypass. Since then, he has not been the same. Once the prototype of a hyperactive Emanuel, suddenly his walking, his talking, his humor got slower. Today he can swim, read the newspaper, needle his kids on the phone, and still live with my mother in their own house. But everything seems sluggish. Although he didnt die from the heart attack, no one would say he is living a vibrant life. When he discussed it with me, my father said, I have slowed down tremendously. That is a fact. I no longer make rounds at the hospital or teach. Despite this, he also said he was happy.
As Crimmins puts it, over the past 50 years, health care hasnt slowed the aging process so much as it has slowed the dying process. And, as my father demonstrates, the contemporary dying process has been elongated.  </TEXT>

An amazing conclusion, which implies that the intelligence of Americans is on average lower than that of the many other countries with better health outcomes -- even where the population is not very health conscious.

<TEXT> Democracy is the only process which confers legitimacy to rule. China's utopian quest for stability without democracy is doomed to fail because self-correcting systems need broad-based input.  The Party is not big enough to see the whole picture unless everyone is included.  Democracy needs active participating citizens who share enough common goals so that they want to live and work together.  Hong Kong's struggle shows the process by which a people is created which is capable of ruling itself well.  Joshua Wong has struck the moral bell, and the resonance has activated a people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am for Single Payer because I believe that basic health care is a human right that should be paid for out of tax dollars.  And I believe that taxes should be based on ability to pay.  But that only starts to answer the question of how well the service is provided.  Conscious participation by the stakeholders is required to make anything work well.  If people don't take care of themselves, the results will turn out badly, no matter what the system.  As far as the point you raise about lack of medical practitioners, I think the best remedy is to make medical education, like military training, a cost we bear collectively.  Train the number we need so that there won't be a shortage, and pay people what we need to pay to keep the supply stable.  Medicine should not be run as a self-protective guild. High incomes (and similar high returns to Big Pharma, etc.) reflect market failure to provide sufficient supply to drive down prices.  Good policy can correct that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Affordable Care Act is built on a pathological private insurance system that cuts costs by minimizing its coverage of vital medical services. Insurance systems need to be big enough to spread the risk. In most places that means that there are only a few choices, and, therefore, people who need insurance have no bargaining power. A single-payer national health program would change that equation. It would be, at least conceptually, possible to rein in costs and provide decent medical service. For such a system to work well, however, civil society will have to be a lot healthier. The electorate will have to be attentive and interested in holding those elected officials responsible for the consequences of their policies. The deeper disease is the cynicism that most people feel about their power to act together and make a difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rule of law is what allows people, and business, to form rational expectations for planning and decision-making.  The market cannot work without a set of rules (not necessarily fixed, but also not arbitrary and volatile).  The law itself must evolve with conditions.  That's why democracy is a pre-condition for the effective rule of law.  The democratic idea takes as a given that there is no all-knowing authority -- that governance must constantly correct its course.  It is the way that conflict can be minimized, and real change achieved voluntarily, without coercion.  It is a process, best played out by people who have similar values and are roughly equal in power.  If the people of Hong Kong can hold themselves together to win democratic rule,  all China will benefit, because it will inevitably follow Hong Kong's path. </TEXT>

U.S. leadership guarantees that there will be a steady stream of recruits for the IS, and a long unconventional war throughout the Sunni Arab world.  Syria-Iraq is only the starting point of the Caliphate.  Jordan, the Arabian peninsula, and Egypt all have regimes which embrace Western materialism while concentrating those goodies of capitalism in the hands of the few.  Totalitarian Islam is a populist response to the failure of modernization to make the lives of most people desirable.  The Arab Spring was the last great hope. The Egyptian military never lost power, and Morsi failed to reach out beyond the Moslem Brotherhood's small business and rural base.  The fight for the Arab world is complicated by the IS commitment to sectarian war against Shia Islam.  That may re-ignite conflict in places like Lebanon. Now the long fight begins.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This can be a turning point -- when the cowardice and conventional wisdom of those holding "fiduciary responsibility" shifts from opposing divestment, to supporting it.  The old CYA default mode position is represented by Harvard:

 Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvards president, has issued statements that she and her colleagues do not believe that divestment is warranted or wise, and argued that the schools $32.7 billion endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.

But that is directly challenged by the RBF divestment:

 Steven Rockefeller, a son of Nelson A. Rockefeller and a trustee of the fund, said that he foresees financial problems ahead for companies that have stockpiled more reserves than they can burn without contributing significantly to climate damage. "We see this as having both a moral and economic dimension," he said.

The whole objective of CYA is to avoid taking responsibility.  With RBF's logic to respond to,  Harvard's cover has been pulled.  Does Harvard et. al. join the climate change deniers, or does it admit that climate change makes a difference, and act accordingly?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of the three cable news network stories, Fox is the most surprising. Most of Fox's story is about how the climate issue does not interest the American people. But they not only gave the crowd estimate, 310,000, they explained how it was derived:

 To calculate the attendance, organizers used a crowd density analysis formula developed by a professor of game theory and complex systems at Carnegie Mellon University. The formula calculated average crowd density over specific intervals, factoring in the surface area covered by the crowd and the speed and duration of the march.

The crowd estimate (which was three times what the organizers had expected) was believable because the organizers had the courage to let the estimate be generated by an objective method -- not their own wishful thinking. And I want to give credit to Fox News, which had the honesty to report that number, despite the fact that it totally contradicts their spin. Something is, in fact, happening. I was there. It was a great experience, filled with good spirit and energy.  People left that march with determination to stay connected, and have an impact. I haven't seen anything this real since the first big Tea Party demonstration in Washington on September 12, 2009. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The non-violent revolution against Assad was lost when it failed to expand its base of support to include Alawites and other minorities.  This is not a criticism, but an unfortunate reality. The result was that the Alawite-dominated military did not desert Assad, but has brutally crushed Sunnis and other opponents of the regime. ISIS opportunistically has stepped in, attacking other opponents of Assad far from the front line of conflict.  And now that the Sunni reaction has spread to Iraq, to Mosul and beyond, panic has set in.  Everyone agrees that "there is no military solution".  But it is only the military dimension that will get done by the U.S. and its satellite nations.  The alternative route is to forebear military responses, and renounce the entire objective of maintaining Western power in the region.  The wealthy countries can provide resources so that local peoples are able to develop their own self-defense strategies.  The goals that are worth promoting would minimize violence, and make coercive occupation too expensive to sustain.  All countries should be opening their borders for resettling refugees.  ISIS would then find that it has captured only itself.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Zephyr Teachout's concession speech was really a victory speech.  She demonstrated that principled, issue-driven politics can go on the offensive, and come remarkably close to beating money and intimidation.  Zephyr gave special tribute to her campaign manager, Mike Boland, who left the Working Families Party after it sold its soul to keep its ballot access.  Cuomo has shown only contempt for the WFP.  The larger lesson is that cynical "realistic" politics mobilizes zero enthusiasm.  Established institutional politics responds to incentives that quickly degenerate into bribery.  The fighting spirit of the Teachout campaign is the only hope for progressive values to survive.  It is the evidence that people can self-organize, with very little money.  And maybe, one day, they'll win.

What is the effect on the proliferation of for-hire vehicles, which would be a traffic disaster in Central Business Districts like the Manhattan Core?  If Uber takes enough business away from licensed cabs, and of public transit, they may lose economic viability.  Cutbacks in those services would make access almost impossible in dense areas.  If Uber can pay for all of the adverse consequences for which it is responsible, then it would have to have deep pockets indeed!
That's why it needs powerful lobbyists and influence peddlers, to make sure that government does not regulate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Take the time to read Adam Shatz' long article on reporting the Middle East.  It is the very point of Shatz's evolution (as a person of the left who values intellectual integrity) that he offers no resolution, no new movement to support whose program and analysis would lead us onto a hopeful path forward.  Shatz is a man who knows what is right, and would like that right to prevail.  But he has no faith that struggle against an immediate oppression builds the momentum that would take us to a fuller liberation. After every victory is a confusing moral subsidence.  His loss of faith in the future comes from his vast experience and openness.  He is fully embedded in the complex.  It is a painful place to be, without a path forward to counter depression, as civilized aspirations appear increasingly quaint.
I do not disagree with Shatz analytically.  But my own need for an anti-depressant raison d-etre requires the possibility that people, sharing the same despair, find solace in common cause.  I hope that others come to share and act according to my faith and identity, which are universalistic.  However unlikely it is that a sustainable humane future can emerge in a world filled with lesser and contending identities, I know that I have to make the case for that whole vision -- not just root for the good guys in particular struggles. The greatest threat, from my point of view, is to succumb to inertia, not bothering to fight for the unlikely.
So I plan to join the Peoples Climate March on September 21 in Manhattan.  Not because it will work, but because I am still here. And quaint is the only hope we have.

<TEXT> Every non-military Gazan injured or killed by Israel, and every non-military Israeli injured or killed by Hamas is potentially the victim of a war crime.  Each attack deserves an impartial international investigation.  Hamas does not claim to avoid civilian casualties.  Its criminal culpability is therefore self-evident.  Israel claims to have made heroic efforts to avoid civilian casualties.  Surely it must have the ability to document its pretensions.  If it fails to show what justified its actions in each case, then it too, like Hamas, must be deemed guilty of war crimes, and must to be held accountable by the world community. </TEXT>

His "Chasing Shadows," the best account yet of Nixon's devious interference with Lyndon Johnson's 1968 Vietnam War negotiations, shows just how early Nixon's dirty tricks began and just how deeply he was involved... Hughes establishes that as soon as Nixon came into office, he knew he had a big secret to hide. Hughes then shows how this secret contributed to Watergate...

<TEXT> Netanyahu's problem is that perpetual war achieves no long-term objective.  The current exercise of "mowing the lawn" -- destroying enough Palestinian lives and property to get submission right now -- only creates a more punishment-resistant strain of Palestinian politics.  If Hamas survives, so will its capacity to launch rockets.  If Hamas is eliminated, ISIS will fill the vacuum. And actual genocide of Palestinians is a policy which is a reactionary utopia.  The Palestinian diaspora and the Arab and Muslim world cannot be eliminated, and they will not always be powerless to inflict revenge -- even on innocent Israelis who oppose the madness of perpetual aggression.  Actions have consequences.  The first step in the right direction is to change direction.  Open Gaza's supply lines to the world, let people come and go.  And take responsibility for the damage that has been done.  Hamas should pay reparations for all of the collateral damage it has done to Israelis, and Israel should pay for all of the collateral damage done to Palestinians.  Let's start by assuming that an Israeli life and a Palestinian life are of equal value.  How much is a life worth? </TEXT>

Tunnels can also be used to hide rockets, or to get supplies from Egypt.  The only way to eliminate those tunnels is for Israel to fully occupy Gaza and remove the entire population while Israel searches and destroys.
The problem for Israel is that this effective response is exhorbitantly costly in Israeli lives and continuous occupation.  Genocide would be cheaper, but would also impose political costs, like bringing Rand Paul into office in the U.S., ending the gravy train.
So all this is for show.  
Hamas has the long-term advantage that Israel's impotent display of ruthless aggression will weaken Israel over time, while the world will owe a moral debt to the remnant of surviving Palestinians, just as the world owed a moral debt to the Jews for not having prevented the Holocaust. </TEXT>

Banning demonstrations which do not call for violence is preemptive and illegitimate use of state power.  It reveals the character of a state: that it would rather repress its non-violent dissident citizens than limit itself to restraining people whose acts are in fact criminal.  Once a state acts preemptively, even thoughts which "challenge order" become punishable offenses.  The Police State mentality has a logic which can be found almost everywhere.

<TEXT> The key question Colvin asks is: What will people do better than computers?
Colvin's jobs for the future appear to be mainly for the leaders:

   Consider the skills in highest demand over the next five to 10 years as specified by employers in a recent survey by Towers Watson and Oxford Economics. Those skills didn't include business acumen, analysis, or P L management. Instead, relationship building, teaming, co-creativity, cultural sensitivity, and managing diverse employees were all near the top....

   Building the skills of human interaction, embracing our most essentially human traits, will play to some people's strengths and make others deeply uncomfortable. Those people will be in trouble.

Unfortunately, that description has only one group securely employed -- Fortune's readers, many of whom, I suspect, are managers hoping to rise up the ladder to leadership.

The more troubling question is not discussed.  What happens to most people, who are becoming economically unnecessary? Capitalism is a system designed to reward winners. Losers are a "social problem".  To the extent that the society rejects social answers to social problems, we are in trouble. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course, it is not only the Israeli regime that is trying its damnedest to torpedo a reasonable accommodation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.  The kidnapping and murder of the settler kids was designed to heighten the brutality of Israeli repression, thereby forcing the Hamas leadership back into the rejectionist camp. Hamas did not have the courage to denounce that crime.  They were stuck with their traditional line that in the fight for liberation, all settlers are fair targets.  That is the politics of endless war.  And it is the fuel that the Israeli regime needed to whip up national unity to re-open "pinpoint" attacks against Hamas "militants".  And there we go again.  Israel aggression could not remain unanswered. Off go the rockets, and the escalation follows.  The question then becomes: How low in the moral order, how high in the ranks of pariah states, is the breaking point for Israel due to the growing revulsion -- both internally and internationally.  Can a burgeoning Israeli culture of sadism (pleasure in inflicting pain) smash the humanist impulse? Israel cannot win this fight. 
There is no Final Solution that Israel can impose on the Palestinian people and on the wider Arab and Muslim world.  The only alternative to extermination of an enemy is accommodation.  
I believe that Israel must demonstrate forbearance unilaterally, even if the rockets continue to be launched. That at least offers the hope of escaping the vortex of death, in which Gaza will not be the only death camp. The United States can help those in Israel who wish to move out of the death trap.  As an American Jew myself, I ask my country to cast its lot for peace, and take the first step itself.  
We must ask: what concrete steps must the U.S. take to show that it does not follow along in support of Israel's pathological path. 
And, of course, I also call for Hamas to unilaterally halt its rocket attacks.  Rockets and terrorism will not stop continued Israeli oppression and expansion.  Making Israel morally worse only deepens the trap for all.
But Palestinians need to know that the world gives a damn about their slow relentless strangulation as a people.
Perhaps the hardest task for us here in America is to not avert our eyes and attention, just because it is all so awful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a 2003 memoir, Fighting Injustice, Michael E. Tigar, the lawyer who represented Mr. Truong at his trial, described the prosecution as part of a political backlash against opponents of the war.

Unrepentant for its errors in Vietnam, he wrote, the government turned against those who had opposed its policies. Rather than opening debate about matters affecting national security, it invoked draconian laws to maintain the wall of secrecy.

Mr. Truongs sister said in a phone interview on Thursday that her brother took a more pragmatic view of the case.

He saw it as a political case, and himself as a very small piece in the game that countries play when they want to achieve their political goals, she said. In that game, she added, her brother understood that we are all expendable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here are some things you should know about the proposed rule:  
On June 2, 2014 EPA proposed its Clean Power Plan which establishes state-based targets for reducing carbon pollution from existing power plants, under Clean Air Act Section 111(d).  Under the plan, carbon emissions will be reduced from 2005 levels by 30% by 2030. Also by 2030, the plan would reduce by over 25% pollutants that contribute to the soot and smog that make people sick. 
EPA considered four Building Blocks, or areas of opportunity, to determine reasonable emissions targets for each state.  In determining feasible cost-effective goals, EPA identified best practices already being done for these contributing factors.  
Targets were then set using (1) a consistent national formula, and (2) state- and regional-specific information.  When taken as a whole, state-by-state targeted emissions meet the overall national goal.
Each state can either follow EPA's "Best System of Emission Reduction" path to meet its target, or it can design its own program to achieve that target. The plan establishes interim and final goals.  States will have flexibility in their rate of program implementation during the 2020-2029 period. They will only be required to achieve a cumulative emissions goal over that whole period.  Thus, states that start slowly will need to have a more aggressive slope of implementation in the later years. 
Building Block elements included to determine the BSER target for each state are:
1. Make fossil fuel-fired power plants more efficient.  The target deemed feasible is a 6% reduction in emissions rates (the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of electricity) from coal-fired plants.  (The significance of this factor in determining a state's target depends on the proportion of power plants fired by coal in that state.) 
2. Expand use of lower-emitting sources as a proportion of the electric power dispatched over the grid. This entails increased utilization of existing (i.e., already operating) electric generating units such as natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants.  EPA assumes that a capacity utilization of NGCC plants of up to 70% can be achieved.
3.  Build more zero/low-emitting energy sources.  EPA's targets for renewable power recognize that states start at different places.  States with a low level of renewable power are assumed to have the opportunity to increase their proportion of renewable power generation, up to the average level prevailing in their region.  
4. Use electricity more efficiently.  Energy efficiency goals are expressed in terms of an annual rate of improvement.  The rate of improvement can be ramped up over time (in EPA's plan, by an increment of 0.15% per year) so that by 2030 all states achieve an annual rate of improvement of electricity use of at least 1.5% (some states are already improving their energy efficiency at a faster rate).
Individual and multi-state plans are due June 30, 2016.
The proposed rule, as well as information about how to comment and supporting technical information, are available online at: http://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan
EPA will hold four public hearings during the week of July 28th in Denver, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.
There will be a 120-day public comment period on the proposal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While more money does not solve problems, any new orientation at the VA should not have to depend on funding out of cuts and/or re-assignments of existing resources. 
Often managers operating within overly-constrained budgets come up with new performance goals that promise to do "more with less".  That can be a flight from reality.  Complex messy issues can get hidden while the new goals are apparently being met.
People in bureaucratic settings often feel compelled to limit their perceptions to fit what the machine expects from them.  What we need (and not only in the VA) is for people to think above their pay grade, express those thoughts, and see themselves as agents for change, in line with the full mission of the organization.  Policy should be an organic product of an intense process incorporating local knowledge, not just directives from above. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congress needs to weigh in on any decision to start bombing Iraq once again. Your Congress member should sign onto the Scott Rigell-Barbara Lee letter, saying the President must come to Congress for authorization before taking military action in Iraq.

Iraq will not turn out the way we desired.  All we can do now is to not make things worse. Any U.S. re-engagement in Iraq would sink the possibility that Iraqis will find a way out of the current crisis.

The politicians who we have backed do not have the confidence of the Iraqi people.  That is why this regime is  losing the country to a vicious opponent.

Further American support for this regime will lead to an uncontrollable civil war.

What is needed is a national unity government that Iraqis are willing to fight for.  It must include Sunnis, Kurds, and Shias who are not corrupt.

An honest Iraqi unity government will not want to be tarnished by association with the U.S.  That is the legacy of our previous actions.

It is better to save lives and recognize the defeat of the American intervention in Iraq than to deny reality in an attempt to save face. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Krugman is right about the deniers of climate change who do so because addressing it would contradict their laissez faire ideology. But an even more serious threat to effective action is the ideology of mainstream economists who do not deny climate change, but think that we should just grow the economy, and then we'll be better able to afford any mitigation effort that might be required. The problem with this approach is that commodified wealth, valued in money, is treated as a universal metric -- for wealth to count it must have a market value. But it is a fallacy that if you have enough wealth, you can buy anything, including mitigation and adaptation for climate change. That disregards every form of wealth that cannot be bought and sold. Degrading natural wealth in the service of commodified wealth is how we got to the fix we're in -- not only on climate, but in many other dimensions. Mobilizing resources to fight climate change is not a market function. It is a global and governmental function. It requires making the transition from following the agenda of private accumulation to that of meeting common needs.
How real is the Obama administration's commitment to effective action? The Keystone XL decision will be a strong test. Stopping KXL only makes sense if we push on from there to a global strategy that sets a rapidly declining cap for carbon emissions. But if KXL is not stopped, the business-as-usual juggernaut will roll on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> More money alone does not solve problems, but a new orientation at the VA should not have to depend on being funded out of cuts and/or re-assignments of existing resources. 

There needs to be a deep cultural shift towards democratic problem-solving.  Following other people's orders is not good for any of us.

The bureaucratic mindset values order over creative responsiveness to emerging needs.  People in bureaucratic settings often feel compelled to limit their perceptions to fit what the machine expects from them.  

Often managers operating within overly-constrained budgets come up with new performance goals that promise to do "more with less".  That can be a flight from reality.  Complex messy issues can get hidden while the new goals are apparently being met.

What we all need (and not only in the VA) is for people to think above their pay grade, express those thoughts, and see themselves as agents for change, in line with the full mission of the organization.  Policy should be an organic product of an intense process incorporating local knowledge, not just directives from above.  The people who the VA should serve -- America's veterans -- will have their needs addressed only to the extent that they also become active participants in shaping the system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the comment I wrote to Harvard, along with my signature:
Meet with Divest Harvard's students as soon as possible to discuss the Harvard Corporation's divestment from fossil fuel corporations.

Investment in the fossil fuel industry is a bad choice for Harvard, on strictly economic terms.  See Nicholas Stern's report, Unburnable carbon 2013: Wasted capital and stranded assets  http://www.carbontracker.org/wastedcapital

Our last hope for averting disastrous climate change depends on drawing a line that contains in place a large portion of the world's remaining (and deeply sequestered) fossil fuels. If we are serious about changing course, investments in the fossil fuel industry make no sense. The necessary restriction on carbon use over the life of expensive new investments, like the Keystone XL pipeline, means that the anticipated fossil fuel product that justify these investments will not be realized.  Expensive fossil fuel production -- the kind that is still left to invest in -- will not be able to compete economically against other cheaper sources that are already developed, that will fill the quota of allowable carbon emissions.  And the price for existing reserves already reflects their value. There is no bonanza left for Harvard to tap. 

When new investments like KXL fail, who will pay the cost of decommissioning the pipeline and restoring the environment?  Corporations (and their hapless investors) will bear their share of the liability, and the rest will fall on taxpayers, leaving an unknown amount of residual damage to be borne directly by the environment and the public.

Of course, it would be wonderful news if you can prove that climate change is not a problem. But if it is, and we have to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions globally, then the cornucopian promise of an abundant fossil fuel supply only makes the global political task more difficult. If we fail to act to protect this world's climate, we will reap the whirlwind.  Then there is no predicting the risks to our social and economic order.  In a world where Cambridge is inundated by the angry rising sea, Harvard will have no Plan B.

Harvard should know what it is doing.  It has a choice to make.  Which side are you on?

<TEXT> What was always clear was that the U.S. was in official denial that Benghazi was dicey territory, not under the control of U.S.-supported elements. A large enough security force to genuinely protect public diplomats would have required a quasi-occupation force, like that in Iraq and Afghanistan. There aren't enough American boots to cover all bases.  Even without considering the impending election, a major military commitment to secure Libya was clearly untenable politically. 
The alternative was to gamble that control by friendly locals would be achieved before hostile forces mobilized themselves to strike the mission. That proved to be wishful thinking. The attack on 9/11/2012 was therefore the outcome of a losing gamble. 
Lesson: Our desires are not determinative of the outcome. The Libyan story does not have a pretty ending. In fact, there is no ending at all.

The Benghazi operation -- both the covert CIA and the U.S. diplomatic mission -- could only be "defended" by a full-scale military occupation. But that would have defeated the purpose of U.S. policy. The mission's object was to secure Benghazi under friendly Libyan control, without U.S. boots on the ground.  They hoped that that would work out before any attack could be organized.  But they got caught short. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fault lines in Ukraine could only be healed if there were a common agenda that would appeal to both Ukrainian speakers, (who predominate in the west) and the Russian speakers, (dominant in the east).  Maidan demonstrators were calling for an end to a corrupt oligarch-controlled state.  But, the Maidan demonstrators lacked an understanding of the dangers of neo-liberal austerity, which the EU would like to impose (as has been done in Greece, Portugal, and Spain).  Fighting domination by both the EU and by Russia would have been a tough agenda, but the basis for building a united people.  Sadly, the political class of Ukraine was not ready to present such a bold program.  The result is a no-win situation for the Ukrainian people.  Unless they unite to fight for their sovereignty as a people, they will continue to be the pawns of oligarchs and bureaucrats, both Russian and Ukrainian. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is to keep that oil deeply sequestered in mother earth.  Transporting oil by traditional means is very limited unless you have major investment in new infrastructure and equipment. Trucking would also be extremely labor intensive.  If you assume the oil will flow for, say, 40 years, it would clearly be cheaper to build a pipeline.  However, if your intention is to ameliorate climate change,  support for the pipeline makes no sense.  The cost of basic extraction and processing makes that tar uneconomic to bring to market.  The tar will remain stuck in Alberta.  Today, with no limits on carbon emissions, current production of tar oil can be hauled by rail or truck.  But no one would invest in ramping up that system. </TEXT>

 What works, say environmental pollsters and researchers, is focusing on popular solutions.... [C]onservatives become less skeptical about global warming if they first read articles suggesting nuclear energy or geoengineering as solutions.

<TEXT>  Soybeans arent the only cause of deforestation in Brazil, but they are a major factor. Brazil is now the worlds second-largest producer of soybeans after the United States. Soybeans have been a boon to Brazils economy, and global demand is growing. Under intense pressure from agricultural interests, Brazils Chamber of Deputies approved legislation in July 2012 that rolled back many provisions of the 1965 Forest Code, reduced the amount of reserve areas in the Amazon and gave amnesty to past violators. To her credit, Brazils president, Dilma Rousseff, thwarted some of the most damaging provisions of the new legislation, but the rate of deforestation still rose.

The struggle to control GHG emissions must be global, but that means overcoming special interests in every country, without having a guarantee that responsible policies will be followed in other countries.  What is needed are strong global incentives to do the right thing.  Until that happens, active citizen participation will be needed everywhere, thinking globally and acting locally.  To be successful, such movements need international solidarity.  It's hard to mount a campaign if you think your cause is right, but your efforts are going to prove futile.  Those who oppose Keystone XL in North America must see those trying to protect the Amazon rain forest as companions in the same struggle.  We need each other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The difficult choice to keep costs down entailed restriction of choice of doctors and hospitals.  This reflects the problem of ACA's architecture, dependent on insurance companies -- a fault that could be remedied by a well-designed Single Payer system, where choice can be maintained, and the real cost of care reimbursed.  From the article:

 In an unusual decision that had a strong impact on consumer choices, New York required insurers to offer the same type of coverage on the exchange as off. The result was that none of New Yorks insurers offered out-of-network coverage for individuals, except in a small part of western New York, because they wanted to hold down costs and avoid being swamped by sick people. So regardless of whether individuals buy their plans on the exchange or off, they cannot get coverage outside a fixed network of doctors and hospitals, even if they are willing to pay more for it. </TEXT>

What has he learned? And how will these affect his future actions? All that we do learn is that Mayor de Blasio was late in appearing before Grynbaum at a location, apparently, of Grynbaum's choice. Was de Blasio doing something even more important than this interview? Grynbaum is too delicate to ask what delayed de Blasio. It clearly was not newsworthy. I am not an apologist for the Mayor. He clearly has much to learn. A commanding electoral victory does not count for much when confronting entrenched power, and turning an electoral mandate into a movement of active citizens (our only hope) is easier said than done.

Unless this systemic problem is consciously recognized, the restricted range of questions that these consultants analyze will be taken as the whole picture, and ICF will pass muster as doing "state of the art" analysis.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comment by Don McCanne:  Sen. Bernie Sanders chaired a Senate committee hearing on what the health care system in the United States can learn from other countries. Tsung-Mei Cheng provided an excellent overview of single payer and of the sharp contrasts between the United States and other nations. Her 28 page statement is well worth downloading to use as an information resource in educating others about single payer.
Other informative presentations included those of Victor Rodwin on France, Ching-Chuan Yeh on Taiwan, Danielle Martin on Canada, and Jakob Kjellberg on Denmark. Even the presentations from the other side by Sally Pipes and David Hogberg were helpful in that they showed how silly (sadly) their views were when contrasted with a group of experts who understand well how systems based on solidarity work.

<TEXT> Pipelines would make sense if fossil fuels could continue to be used at the current or an expanding rate for decades -- long enough to pay for the new infrastructure and its maintenance over time.  But climate risk is real, and fossil fuel use must be capped and ratcheted down over time.  Long-term investments like pipelines don't make economic sense (they're only attractive for developers who will take the money and stick the taxpayers with the cost of the environmental damage and decommissioning of stranded assets). Now it is clear that the short-term alternative, the rail system, is inadequate for even the current output of oil.  
This reflects a failure of public policy to take responsibility for feasible consequences.  It is the price of not committing to a rapid transition to renewable alternatives to fossil fuels.
The shale oil boom has hit a transportation wall.  Shale and tar sand oil are not energy solutions -- just seductive mirages that have kept focus off of the urgent need for development of an energy efficient and renewable future. </TEXT>

 The role of the British and the French was even more sinister, as they actually colluded with the Serbian architects of genocide. This was confirmed at the highest level recently by the White House historian Taylor Branch in his book The Clinton Tapes (2009). In taped interviews with Branch, which were released after a ten-year hiatus, President Bill Clinton recounted how the British and French insisted on maintaining the embargo on the defenseless Bosnians: "They justified their opposition on plausible humanitarian grounds, arguing that more arms would only fuel the bloodshed, but privately, said the president, key allies objected that an independent Bosnia would be `unnatural' as the only Muslim nation in Europe. He said that they favored the embargo precisely because it locked in Bosnia's disadvantage." Branch, in conversation with Clinton, continued: "When I expressed shock at such cynicism, reminiscent of the blind-eye diplomacy regarding Europe's Jews during World War II, President Clinton only shrugged. He said that President Francoise Mitterand of France had been especially blunt in saying that Bosnia did not belong, and that British officials also spoke of a painful but realistic restoration of Christian Europe." None of this was lost on Serbian leaders like Radovan Karadzsic, Momcilo Krajisnik, or Nikola Koljevic, who would repeatedly state that they were actually doing the West a favor by preventing the emergence of a Muslim-majority state in Europe.

A large enough security force to genuinely protect public diplomats would have required a quasi-occupation force, like that in Iraq and Afghanistan.  That was politically untenable. The alternative was to gamble that control by friendly locals would be achieved before hostile forces mobilized themselves to strike.  That proved to be wishful thinking.

<TEXT> Steve Kornacki on MSNBC floated a different theory about why Christie's people shut down two-thirds of Fort Lee's GW Bridge access. There's a billion dollar development project in Fort Lee, right next to where the lane closures occurred. The project is Mayor Sokolich's major accomplishment in office. Close the lanes, and the entire project could be derailed.
What Kornacki doesn't say is that closing the lanes would demonstrate that the project would not be viable without the cooperation of Christie. Demonstrating his ability to cut access to the bridge means that the developers would have to pay to play -- contributions, jobs for cronies, etc. It would show that Sokolich could not deliver the basic service of mobility without Christie. Unfortunately for Christie, this act of intentional sabotage succeeded too well. Too much collateral damage. Too much public outcry. And the tissue of lies that Christie's cronies had set up as a defense -- the traffic study for the "Reallocation of Lanes on the GWB" was totally unconvincing. When they saw they were in trouble, the coverup began. And the coverup will be the basis for future indictments.
It is now clear that there was a conspiracy to deny their involvement by Christie operatives. Christie had a need not to know what was done on his behalf. The fact that these folks used more muscle than brain has got them into their current fix. It's hard to believe that they were smart enough to shield CC from contagion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those of us who have always been for Healthcare for All were very clear in laying out the problems with the current law, at each stage of the many "compromises" that got vested interests to sign on.  We see private insurance companies and other major corporate players hijacking a vital human service to maximize profit.  That is what has made American healthcare so unaffordable and dysfunctional.  ACA deals with some of the problems, but creates others, and leaves many problems unaddressed.  Single Payer or Medicare for All points us in the right direction -- looking at providing quality affordable healthcare for all.  But slogans are not answers.  The substance of building a decent healthcare system requires many actions, such as investing in the education of medical practitioners so that they don't have to charge a fortune to pay back their med school debts.  Once ACA starts saving lives -- and it will -- it will become clear why it can't be repealed without a better law to replace it.  Then the serious conversation can begin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point of looking at the many unintended consequences of the ACA is not to go back to a mythical market solution, but to learn and change what is wrong.  Healthcare should be allocated based on medical need, not ability to pay.  We pay for national defense to protect us.  We know that we can't afford to defend ourselves, gun in hand, when the scale of the threat goes outside the range of personal confrontation.  For healthcare, or fire or police protection to work, or to get from place to place, we need to build structures in common, which are publicly funded.  Insurance schemes are not the right way to think about healthcare as a societal problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don McCanne Comment:  This comprehensive report lays to rest once and for all the the rumor that physicians are leaving Medicare in droves. Most physicians accept new Medicare patients, and less than 1 percent have formally opted-out of the Medicare program.
An improved Medicare would be even more attractive to physicians, especially if it covered everyone. It would dramatically reduce hassles with intrusive third party payers so that physicians could spend most of their time doing what they devoted their lives to - taking care of their patients.
As far as the threat that physicians would quit if we enacted an improved Medicare for all, first of all, very few would leave - likely less than 1 percent - and, second, since most of those who would leave seem to be more interested in money rather than patients (think concierge), we really dont want them around anyway.

<TEXT> Don McCanne Comment:  To pass the Affordable Care Act, President Obama was convinced that he had to gain the support of the health financing and health care industries. He did. Look who's profiting.
Who loses? Those who will have to pay much more out of pocket for health care because of higher deductibles. Those who lose choice of their physicians and hospitals because of narrower provider networks, and end up losing catastrophic protection because of care inadvertently received out of network. Those who will be contributing through taxes or insurance premiums far more than they should have to because of the profoundly wasteful administrative excesses of our dysfunctional financing system. That's most of us. The improvements in insurance plans for the few - guaranteed issue and community rating - do not begin to offset the deterioration that is beginning to take place in the employer-sponsored plans where most of us receive our health care coverage.
There are a few of us who will gain, some by being enrolled in Medicaid and some by receiving subsidies for exchange plans, but the numbers of us who will lose is far greater than the numbers who will win.
We could have had reform in which we would all be winners - an improved Medicare that covers everyone. Even those who will gain through Medicaid or subsidies would gain much more under a single payer system. But no, political feasibility dictated that the vested stakeholders of the medical-industrial complex be the ones who get the money, while the rest of us pay more and get less.

<TEXT> Marx is useful in providing tools for the analysis of how societies function.  For example, ideologies don't come out of pure thought but reflect material conditions and interests.  Unfortunately, "Marxism" does not stand outside, looking down on the world, as some Marxists seem to believe.  Marxism is a part of the world it wishes to analyze, and got used to defend some terrible regimes.  The useful question for me is: how can we organize production to meet human needs.  I think that capitalism creates more problems than it can solve.  Profit motive doesn't work when trying to defend the environment.  If global warming cannot be ruled out as a risk, then it must be the basis for a global response.  We must live within our planetary resource limits and produce enough to meet basic needs.  In short, there is more than enough real work to be done for everyone, and much of the reward in living must be non-material.  What we can afford to be is spiritually ambitious.
The trick is to use all of the tools of self-organization, not just the profit motive, to move us towards a humane and sustainable world.  The sense of pride -- the story that makes our lives worthy of remembering by future generations -- is not in our accumulation of toys, but in how we express ourselves, work together, and treat each other.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don McCanne Comment:  The value-based payment modifier - an adjustment in payments to reward physicians for improving value in the health care they provide, or to punish them for providing lower value - is yet another example of the often misguided measures in the Affordable Care Act allegedly designed to improve our health care system, when, in fact, the fundamental reforms in the health care financing system that we really needed were barely touched upon, in deference to the private insurance industry.
It will be difficult to change from a volume-based system (fees based on volume of services provided) to a value-based payment system when we still do not know how to define the value of physician services, as Drs. Berenson and Kaye explain to us in this NEJM article, though they do suggest some other modest measures that might have some benefit.
It is fine to continue research on measures that have a potential for improving value in health care, but it is almost criminal to ignore a concept that has already been proven in other nations to dramatically increase value - potentially a far greater increase than all of the other measures combined that are included in the Affordable Care Act. Of course, that concept is single payer financing. Lets first enact an improved Medicare for all, and then we could tweak the system with measures that might provide incremental improvements in value. But first things first.

<TEXT> Nordhaus is rational and not a denier of science.  So he recognizes the problem.  But he fails to understand the game-changing requirements for any solution. The problem with Nordhaus' methodology is that commodified wealth, valued in money, is his universal metric.  This leads to the fallacy that if you have enough wealth, you can buy anything, including mitigation and adaptation for climate change.  But that disregards every form of wealth that cannot be bought and sold.  Degrading natural wealth in the service of commodified wealth is how we got to the fix we're in -- not only on climate, but in many other dimensions.  Mobilizing resources to fight climate change is not a market function.  It is a global and governmental function.  It requires making the transition from following the agenda of private accumulation to that of meeting common needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don McCanne Comment:  The new health plans to be offered in the exchanges are avoiding excessive premium increases by using narrow networks of physicians and by lowering payment rates for health services. The leaders of our nations leading organizations of health care professionals are concerned enough about what this might do to patient access that they met with Obama administration officials at the White House.
The administration officials were already "acutely aware" of these problems. Of course, they were. They result from fundamental design flaws in the financing model of the Affordable Care Act. The model was designed by and for the private insurance industry.
It is likely that members of these professional organizations are not only concerned about the patients, narrow networks and lower payments have a direct effect on their livelihoods. In a well designed system, patients must always come first, but the professionals taking care of the patients should be content as well. Grumpy doctors and nurses detract from an optimal patient care environment.
There will be more discontentment as the Obamacare model of high-deductibles, narrow networks, and payment restrictions extend to employer-sponsored private plans. These trends will no doubt expand with the proliferation of private insurance exchanges catering to employers - exchanges outside of the government-operated Obamacare exchanges. Even the private Medicare Advantage plans are being modified in response to their overpayments being pared back. UnitedHealth, the nations largest private insurer, has notified thousands of physicians that they are being dropped from their Medicare Advantage network.
Do we really want to keep headed in this direction?
The traditional Medicare program does not use narrow networks. Patients have their choice of their health care professionals. Medicare payment rates are higher than the rates expected to be offered by most of the exchange plans. It would not take much to improve Medicare, and then it would be an ideal program for covering everyone.
You can bet that the representatives of these professional groups didn't ask for single payer to be put on the table. Too bad.

<TEXT> Don McCanne's Comment:  Insurers will be paying physicians less through their exchange plans than they do through their existing commercial plans. If the rates turn out to be typically 30 or 40 percent less, as this article suggests, they will have problems maintaining adequate provider networks. An insurance card is of little value if you cannot find physicians who will accept it.
As we said from the start, those designing health care reform were making a terrible mistake when they decided to make health insurance premiums affordable while largely ignoring health care costs.
Look what they did:
* They assigned very low actuarial values to the plans that most individuals will select, leaving 30 to 40 percent of health care costs to be paid by the patient, though some will receive inadequate subsidies.
* They designed plans with very high deductibles, causing the large percentage of patients who need less care to receive virtually no sickness or injury benefits from their plans.
* They reduced the size of their provider networks which will reduce spending by making care less accessible, especially specialized care.
* Now it appears that they will be reducing provider payments to levels that will be rejected by many physicians. Although employer-sponsored plans are moving in the same direction, it is likely that many physicians will limit their practices to these plans and cash-paying patients, while avoiding patients in the exchange plans and the chronically-underfunded Medicaid program.
* As part of the SGR fix, legislators are considering not allowing any inflationary increases in the Medicare program for the next ten years - keeping the payment rates flat. If so, physicians are apt to leave the Medicare program as payment rates approach that of Medicaid.
As we approach $3 trillion in health care spending, this is criminal! For that kind of spending, everyone could have high quality health care. Instead, we get a system that perpetuates disparities in health care while creating financial burdens for precisely those individuals who most need health care.
The entire health care system will not collapse, but this experiment will perform so miserably that most will consider it to be a failure. We dont need to go back to the drawing boards. We merely need to enact a system that we already know will achieve our goals - an improved Medicare for all.

<TEXT> Americans are over-medicated. And under-medicated too.  The trick is to provide everyone with appropriate care -- where the incentives do not drive the treatment plan.  The hopeful aspect of Obamacare is that it is an attempt to address real problems.  It has broken through the cowardice bias that lets politicians avoid difficult issues. And now that the mold is broken, now that the rolling collapse that was the old system cannot be re-established for anybody, we will be forced to save ourselves from the many unintended side-effects of this new course.  Talk is no longer cheap.  There are consequences.  Denial and passivity are no longer options.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This 2013 survey sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund is very helpful during the Affordable Care Act transition because it tells us how the United States is doing compared to ten other industrialized nations with universal systems. Our results are terrible, and when we look ahead at the changes yet to be implemented, it is clear that they will have an almost negligible impact on correcting the serious deficiencies in the United States.
Our per capita costs will remain far higher than those of other nations. Our insurance products will remain very expensive yet highly flawed in design since they leave those individuals who have significant health care needs with high medical cost burdens. The excessive complexity of our insurance products will continue to waste hundreds of billions of dollars that could be used on health care. Measures intended to provide much needed reinforcement of our primary care infrastructure are all too meager, so timely access to care will remain impaired for too many.
Three-fourths of Americans believe that we need fundamental changes or complete rebuilding of our health system. We have a far greater percentage dissatisfied than are in the other developed nations. Although it will be several weeks before the exchange plans and the Medicaid expansions will be in effect, most Americans will not be able to detect any improvements in their health care financing and access.
In fact, many will have greater out-of-pocket costs because of increased shifting of costs to patients through measures such as high deductibles, and others will lose access to their current health care professionals and institutions because of the greater use of narrow provider networks - further reducing choices in health care. In spite of the noble intentions of the Affordable Care Act, most of us will not see any correction of the serious flaws demonstrated in this international survey which shows how costly and dysfunctional our system is, and too many of us will be even worse off.
As we watch the 2014 implementation unfold, we have to keep in mind that it didnt have to be this way. We could have had and still can have a single payer national health program - an improved Medicare covering everyone. With what we spend, we should be at the top in these international comparisons. Single payer would get us there.

<TEXT> The deeper problem is in the design of the law itself. The flaw of Obamacare is that it tries to use an insurance model as the means to answer a problem which is not susceptible to private insurance: the compelling moral responsibility of society to provide healthcare to sick people who can't afford it. The best way to do that is to cover the cost through taxes, based on ability to pay. Instead, a government-rigged private insurance model has been created that misrepresents what people are paying for. There is an insurance component which should be priced at the actuarial value of the benefit. When people can't afford to pay. the difference should be subsidized through taxes -- not tacked onto the insurance premiums of those who happen to be at low risk for needing healthcare. Of course, Medicare for All would have avoided these problems. If we had gone that route, we would be talking about the real issues -- like providing enough service at a price we can afford, with enough compensation to keep doctors and hospitals doing their jobs.  Doing the right thing, in a way that would work, means healthcare for all Americans will cost more -- not less.  But if that is spent on real service rather than on profits and waste, it will be money well spent. </TEXT>

Strict income equality would impose its own costs on society -- including excessive costs of enforcement (if equality is not a universal value that people voluntarily strive for).  Democratic movements like the labor movement have been the only countervailing power to limit inequality in this society.  The old movements have now lost the power to mount effective resistance.  But conscious people do not accept their descent into servitude as inevitable, even if it is likely.  The first task of a movement to renew our society is to recognize that cynicism is bad medicine.

<TEXT> The U.S. has become a pitiless helpless giant, thrown off-balance. Like a dumb opponent in jiu-jitsu, everyone sees its habit of plunging into a fight without thinking.  It's like the last attempt by medieval knights to organize yet another crusade when everybody is sick of failed crusades.
Another approach is needed.  Once the U.S. renounces its self-proclaimed entitlement to superstate violence, it may have a chance at redeeming some credibility, and if it works really hard, trust.
One opportunity here that has not been looked at is the political opening offered by the new President of Iran, Rouhani, who has denounced the use of chemical weapons, although he does not blame Assad for their use.
Let the scientists look at the evidence, and confirm Assad's role.  Let Iran know that it is not the object of encirclement, in preparation for an attack.  They have a legitimate interest in protecting the Alawite population of Syria from jihadi annihilation.  But that does not mean they need Assad in power.
A move towards recognizing Iran's long-term defensive needs is a prerequisite for peace in a post-Assad Syria.

<TEXT> General Scales points out that only Eisenhower understood war well enough to avoid war, despite political pressure.  And that is true.  Eisenhower had enough gravitas based on his commanding role in World War II, to sidestep the trap of the fact-free ideology known as "bipartisan foreign policy".  He refused to entangle the U.S. in Vietnam -- neither to support the French imperial war, nor to militarily engage on behalf of South Vietnam. Eisenhower and his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, aggressively used U.S. power to topple democratic governments and support dictators.  Dulles advocated "brinksmanship" -- going to the edge of nuclear Armageddon in order to win a Cold War point.  But Eisenhower had the strength and personal credibility not to use the troops or the bombs or the missiles, because he understood that you do not want to win in your own name.  Because then you become an occupier, and are bled to death, like colonial Britain and France.  Since Eisenhower, American Presidents have been too weak to avoid demonstrating their masculine resolve.  In the name of showing the "credibility" of American power, we have been in near-constant war.  Even under Bill Clinton, Iraq was constantly being bombed.  That ultimately paved the way for Bush's war -- the post-911 demonstration that America was not impotent.  Except it proved the reverse. Today's Iraq is the land conduit for Iran's military support of Assad.  Enter Barack Obama -- a man who once understood what was wrong with America's bankrupt foreign policy.  But now he is "in charge", and it is his "responsibility" to make the same mistakes.  The difference is that he so clearly doesn't really believe in the storyline that he has a terrible time acting the part.  And the audience is walking out on the show.  It can no longer suspend disbelief.  "Trust" died with the meltdown of the credit system. John Kerry's delusional arrogance is not mistaken by almost anyone as expressions of wisdom and principle.  And so it goes.
Now, we learn from General Scales, even the generals no longer believe they can save the day, and come to the rescue of the politicians. (Or, as he calls them, "the U.S. military's civilian masters").
Finally it is time for new ideas.  Since we cannot annihilate nor occupy Assad's Syria, the usable power of the United States is insufficient to counter-balance Assad's calculus. He'll take the punishment and gas his way to victory.  
Only when we see U.S. "enforcement" as counterproductive. can we move on to a new paradigm which is post-superpower-hegemony. Rather, we must recast ourselves, in our own eyes and that of others, as one nation among many, in a world which may be governed by consent and contract, but which cannot be controlled by force.
The real response to Assad's crimes against humanity is to build international solidarity against his regime, shaming those who have supported him into dropping that support. Containment of a pariah state is only possible when a single standard of law and morality is applied to everybody -- to the U.S. and Israel, and to China, Russia, and many others. It is a long haul towards civilization. But we have run out of short-term fixes.
Syria is a good place to start building a sustainable world order. We must call for scrupulous respect for the U.N. investigative process, and prepare charges that are well-documented before the International Court of Justice.
Our immediate task should be to shelter the innocent victims of wars, not create more of them.
A new internationalism based on law seems like idealism, but we cannot afford the burden of being the one superpower -- the one self-appointed adult in charge of all the unruly children. It doesn't work, and it is beginning to look pitiful.
Admission that the old foreign policy has failed would provide the clean break needed to help build a world whose moral roots would be strong and resilient enough to outlast tyrants like Assad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't been able to locate the CPUC document that is the subject of the story, but looking at the CPUC site, it appears that energy storage is rated with respect to its ability to meet peak load demand.  The argument is that to the extent that energy storage can substitute for building additional transmission and distribution capacity for the highest expected peak hours, it is worth a lot in costs which would otherwise have to be undertaken.  In a recent document from EPRI, the default peak period is four hours.  I assume that the 1.325 gigawatt capacity would be continuously available for the four hour period.  Here's the citation:
Cost-Effectiveness of Energy Storage in California
Technical Update, June 2013

Qualifying capacity is a measure to make sure that the battery has the required duration to  meet system capacity requirement. The default assumption for the duration requirement is  4 hours, which means a 50-MW/2-hr battery would earn value as a 25-MW/4-hr battery  for this service. The qualifying capacity in this case is 25 MW

<TEXT> I think that Assad does not care about moral condemnation by me or anyone else.  But if the monstrous consequences of his victory plan cannot be denied by anybody -- even the Chinese and Russian states that don't normally give a damn -- then we start to have the basis for long-term collective action.  First comes undeniable facts, then revulsion, then the need to act.  Intelligent appropriate action is more complex.  Start with a ceasefire in place.  All outside players must apply pressure on their clients to give up winner-take-all goals.  Risks taken for peace should be rewarded.    Assad's Alawite base, like Saddam's Sunni base, is composed of real people, who  have to be protected, even as they give up privileges given them by the dictator.  Oppressed Sunnis in Syria, just like oppressed Shi'a in Iraq must not be vengeful.  
The one thing that is certain is that swinging a bat at the hornets' nest may feel satisfying in the moment, but not for long. </TEXT>

<TEXT> President Obama said on "PBS NewsHour." "But we do have to make sure that when countries break international norms on weapons like chemical weapons that could threaten us, that they are held accountable."

That is right.  But the administration's contemplated military action is simply reactive to Syria's crossing Obama's "red  line".   It does not make sense.  It would hurt, not help, in achieving greater security against chemical weapons.

Assad is fighting for his life.  He will do whatever it takes to stay in power.  He knows that military intervention and occupation by the U.S. is not possible.  Therefore, he believes he will survive, and, if he does, he will be seen as stronger for outlasting any outburst of U.S. pique.

And free to use chemical weapons again.  They are the least costly way for his regime to remove opponents from territory Assad needs to control, without destroying physical assets like buildings and infrastructure.

Then what does a shamed and apparently impotent United States do in response? We have too much recent history not to know this recipe for disaster.

Assad needs to normalize the use of chemical weapons in order to take back opposition strongholds.  He wants to re-occupy and re-populate territory, cleansed of opponents -- a truly diabolical crime against humanity.

The usable power of the United States is insufficient to counter-balance Assad's calculus.  Only when this is recognized can we move on to a new paradigm which is post-superpower-hegemony.  Rather, we (I am an American) must recast ourselves, in our own eyes and that of others, as one nation among many, in a world which may be governed by consent and contract, but which cannot be controlled by force.

The real response to Assad's crimes against humanity is to build international solidarity against his regime, shaming those who have supported him into dropping that support.  Containment of a pariah state is only possible when a single standard of law and morality is applied to everybody -- to the U.S. and Israel, and to China, Russia, and many others.  It is a long haul towards civilization.  But we have run out of short-term fixes.

Syria is a good place to start building a sustainable world order. The place to start is to call for scrupulous respect for the U.N. investigative process, and to prepare charges that are well-documented before the International Court of Justice.

Our immediate task should be to shelter the innocent victims of wars, not create more of them.

A new internationalism based on law seems like idealism, but we cannot afford the burden of being the one superpower -- the one self-appointed adult in charge of all the unruly children.  It is delusional arrogance.

Admission that the old foreign policy has failed would provide the clean break needed to help build a world whose moral roots would be strong and resilient enough to outlast tyrants like Assad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one who cares about how people actually live thinks that you can live well on public assistance.  So if a majority of people who are working earn less than what people on assistance get, it says a lot about how much harder it is for most people than it used to be.  The best incentive for more people to work is a healthy job market, where competition for labor pulls up wages. For a short time, during the housing construction bubble, it looked like all boats would be rising.  But that was an illusion. Almost all of the income growth over the last couple of decades has gone to the top income brackets.  So, with that in mind, whose belt needs tightening now? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This opens up deeper questions which no one is offering to answer.  The attempt to sustain inequality is anti-human, and there are lots of people who won't let their humanity stand in the way of their support for a brutal failing attempt to tighten the tourniquet on the flow of people across borders.  American well-being rests on the illusion that you can always have cheap goods and services produced by the third world poor, either in their own countries or here as illegal immigrants.  By not understanding the shortsightedness of this, we get both poorer and meaner.  Moving toward global sustainability is a generational task that leads towards equality.  But we are far from recognizing even the possibility of policies that would lead to long term human solutions.

<TEXT> As America learned in Vietnam, sometimes your puppets jerk you around.  They follow their own power lust.  The Egyptian generals don't really care about America's security interests.  They just want to stay in power and control Egypt's wealth.  And they have learned from Bashir Assad how beneficial it is to crush peaceful opposition and force a desperate and violent response.  That induced violence is soon seen by the world as perhaps the greater evil.  Endless war against "terrorists" is the justification for crushing liberty everywhere.  Closing democratic options normalizes the architecture of a police state.  The real losers are the people, everywhere, who will never get their real problems addressed, as society and civilization slip away into barbarism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People of low-socioeconomic status who have high-deductible health plans have 25 to 30 percent fewer emergency department visits for high-severity medical conditions - conditions with a high probability of needing ED-level care within twelve hours. That can't be good.

Since similar trends were not found in people of high-socioeconomic status, the authors suggest that deductibles should be means-based - lower deductibles for those of low-socioeconomic status. But that would add more administrative complexity to our system already overburdened with administrative excesses.

The purpose of the deductibles is to reduce health care spending, but we don't want to do that by not taking care of individuals with high-severity medical conditions. It would be far more efficient to simply eliminate deductibles for everyone and use better, patient-friendly methods of controlling spending. That's what single payer is all about - people getting the health care they need while making it affordable for everyone.

<TEXT> The attempt to have total surveillance, plus irrational fear, are the foundational structures for totalitarianism.  How close we choose to get to self-imprisonment for the sake of security is the public question raised by Snowden's outing of the surveillance state.
Instead of connecting a limited number of "suspect" dots, there is now a surfeit of dots. They must be processed using an analytical model -- a profiling machine.  Dots can then be selected which are deemed "suspicious".  
The model, itself is a product of an agenda which is never disclosed.  The model that can turn us into suspects is outside our control.  The way to become "noticed" is to dissent from the agenda of those who embody institutional power.  Welcome to  the managerial revolution -- the great convergence that unites the U.S., China, global corporations, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Acts of world-historic courage make us uncomfortable.  What Snowden did was make us confront our loss of control over the apparatus of the state.  The balance between security and freedom has radically shifted. In the name of defending our security, we have been giving those who are supposed to represent our interests an unprecedented ability to control our choices and destinies.  Snowden sees clearly where this leads. Without our ability to control the controllers, we lose the dignity of a free people.  We need not be respected.  An agenda which is not ours will determine our future.  This is where Tea Party and Occupy people, who already understand the threat, must come together to at least try to stem the drift towards a dark new order.  Cynicism is as much an enemy as complacency.  The question is: what steps take us off the path to serfdom?  One thing I know, for myself: Edward Snowden has joined Bradley Manning and Daniel Elsberg as a person who has acted out of conscience for all of our sakes.  There can be no higher reward in life than to follow in their path. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  An immediate restructuring would have been cheaper for European taxpayers, as private-sector creditors were repaid in full for two years before 2012 using the money borrowed by Athens. Greece's debt level thus remained undented, but it was now owed to the IMF and euro-zone taxpayers instead of banks and hedge funds.

Comment: Like the bond rating agencies, the IMF analysis of risk was determined by the need for a market-supporting result.  Now that the IMF has acknowledged its intellectual bankruptcy, it is time for a total reorganization.  We cannot afford to be the mistakeholders for a financial system that takes "risks" at our expense, while its profits are guaranteed by the superstate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi affair reflects business-as-usual politics, brought to a boil by proximity to the 2012 election.  The real problem is that politicians never want to admit that the world, under their watch, is not in good control.  The European and American decision to jettison Qaddafi was not the product of a plan, but an attempt to catch up with spontaneous revolutionary events.  The West sided with the insurrection to recapture Libya as an orderly business-friendly state.  That was what the CIA and Ambassador Stevens saw as their mission, in the face of continuing chaos.  The U.S. government could have withdrawn from the game.  But it could not have guaranteed the safety of its mission against attack, without a massive and infeasible military intervention.  Playing out a weak hand is embarrassing.  The less said the better.  The problem with that default setting is that the public is never treated as adult, never told the risks and complexity.  And an ignorant public goes on to support ignorant and increasingly bellicose politicians, until the cost of ill-conceived interventions becomes both too high and too difficult to hide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The union anthem, "Solidarity Forever," declares that "no force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one." That's why workers need to bargain collectively.  Asymmetry of power makes workers exploitable in the market for labor.  Exactly the same relationship exists -- but even more so -- in the market for vital health services.  This is not like choosing between health clubs, or among yoga instructors.  The newly released database reveals how dangerous it is to rely on "competition", or on the integrity and good faith of health care providers.   When your life is at risk, your decisions are, at best, only partially informed.  You must place your trust, at some point, in people who know things that you can't know.  You need to band together with other people.  You need a powerful advocate.  In a properly functioning society, people would trust the government they elected to perform that function.  (Americans used to trust their government only 50 years ago. Perhaps that was misplaced, but there was a basis for it in the New Deal's response to people's needs.)  Today, there is a lot of wishful thinking covering over deep fear. Many people claim to believe that the market can and will protect their lives. (That works fine as long as you're healthy.)  They have become convinced that the government cannot be used to protect their interests, because, whatever it says it is doing, it is actually working for the interests of others. (Left and right differ as to who is in control of the government's real agenda.)  So, where does that leave us?  With a dysfunctional social order that is threatening our well-being. The U.S. health care system is only the most glaring example of a social disease -- the collapse of institutions that address the overarching causes of systemic problems. I believe that cynicism is a one-way trip to depression and irrelevance.  The re-invention of a collective common will (a society worth fighting for) will require people building institutions that they can again trust, through their own involvement in participatory and democratic movements.  Occupy Wall Street was a first, and faltering, step in the right direction.  More difficult steps are required.
tl;dr: The health care mess won't be fixed until government works.  Making that happen is our job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Single Payer is not The Answer.  It is simply the first step needed if we are to go in the right direction.
The real problem is that health care -- especially for the aging -- is not appropriately addressed by "insurance" at all. Just like "fire insurance" is not the same as fire protection, health insurance can in no way assure that our health is adequately protected.
That requires provision of a health infrastructure and capacity that must be available to all -- because public health is the most essential public good. If my neighbor and the people I buy stuff from get sick and are untreated, that unnecessary misfortune is contagious. If they go to inadequate congested emergency rooms and I have an emergency, my life is in jeopardy.
We need enough hospitals, clinics, and trained medical personnel so that medical services are not scarce. That is the first step in assuring that they will not be expensive.
A second step is to make sure than new technology -- drugs and medical devices -- are not the source of huge monopoly profits. Much of the R D that gets incorporated into medical advances has already been paid for by the public. Only the profits are privatized.
Funding real health services is not a private responsibility. The ever-higher costs and ever-poorer performance of our current system provide compelling evidence that we can't afford a profit-incentive large enough to make that happen.
Republicans are true believers in the myth that the private profit motive is the great solvent for all problems. It is a simple faith. No further thought is required.
Against the purity of Republican ignorance, the Obama Democrats mounted a deceitful response. By aborting consideration of Medicare for All, and requiring everyone to buy private insurance, the Democrats gave up on a principled alternative to Ryan's  proposed voucher system -- Medicare for None.
It's time to recognize the real problem, and take that first step in the right direction -- Single Payer. It's not so difficult. Imagine our police and fire departments billing indiscriminately for their services. What a mess that would be. We receive a far greater value by using global budgets based on department needs. In the same manner, our hospitals should be globally budgeted based on the health care needs of the community.
We are capable of self government.  Let's do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If there is a public benefit from the development and commercialization of  new technologies, how can this best be done so that private funds are induced to evaluate the risk, and undertake the venture (because they determine the reward is worth the risk)?  The best way is for the government to guarantee the purchase of the new product, if, and only if, it meets performance specifications.  Then, if the price needed to induce private investment proves to be excessive, it is a clear indicator that more basic R D is needed.  That could be the signal for direct investment in that work through a national lab.

http://action.reproductiveaccess.org/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=13631
I heard the report today on NPR about "Family Doctors Consider Dropping Birth Control Training Rule."  Is it your intent to attack women's reproductive health care access?  Remember what happened when the Komen Foundation politicized its mission by defunding Planned Parenthood.  That has not been, and will not be, forgotten.

Your proposed changes to the Family Medicine Program Requirements take out contraception and options counseling for unintended pregnancy and don't include training for miscarriage and abortion.  These changes compromise the care we depend on.

I am very concerned that the proposed program requirements will leave family physicians unable to provide basic reproductive health care, such as birth control, pregnancy options counseling and care for miscarriage.

Women's health is basic health care.  The Family Medicine Program Requirements need to be strengthened, not weakened, to ensure that:

**Family physicians can provide all FDA-approved birth control options, including IUDs and contraceptive implants.
**Family physicians are trained in pregnancy options counseling.  Having a child is one of the most important decisions a woman makes in her life.  Support for healthy families requires nothing less than well-trained clinicians who can counsel women on all their options.
**Family physicians can support women in all of their pregnancy outcomes.  This includes being able to manage miscarriage.  Training in uterine aspiration needs to be included.

Women need to be able to get all their basic health care from their family doctors.  This means improving the family medicine residency program requirements for women's health.

<TEXT> See Lord Stern's new report, Unburnable carbon 2013: Wasted capital and stranded assets
http://www.carbontracker.org/wastedcapital

Our last hope for averting disastrous climate change depends on drawing a line that contains in place Athabascan tar sand oil. If we are serious about changing course, the Keystone XL pipeline makes no sense. The necessary restriction on carbon use over the life of the pipeline will mean that tar sand oil will not be able to compete economically against other cheaper sources that will fill the quota of allowable carbon emissions. When Trans Canada fails, who will pay the cost of decommissioning the pipeline and restoring the environment?

Of course, it would be wonderful news if you can prove that climate change is not a problem. But if it is, and we have to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions globally, then the cornucopian promise of an abundant fossil fuel supply only makes the global political task more difficult. The chances are that we will choose an energy high until climate disruption is the only thing people can think about.

<TEXT> From the study:
Yet bonding and insurance companies may be reluctant to 
provide coverage for water contamination from fracturing, at least until the risks are better understood. One response, then, is to limit fracturing to companies with significant capital, and 
to require parent guarantees to keep firms from avoiding liability with thinly capitalized subsidiaries... If insolvency turns out to be a problem, a mixed liability/government insurance regime
may be needed. The Price Anderson Act, which applies to nuclear power, is one model. The Oil Pollution Act, governing oil spills, is another. In this spirit, any energy company that engages in fracturing could be required to contribute to a general fund, which would cover the damages if the responsible energy company is insolvent. If the fund is exhausted, taxpayers 
would make up the difference.  </TEXT>

Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded university-run research center, said the report didn't take into account the lack of snowfall in the Rockies the previous winter and how that affected overall moisture in the air. Nor did the study look at the how global warming exacerbated the high pressure system that kept the jet stream north and the rainfall away, he said.
"This was natural variability exacerbated by global warming," Trenberth said in an email. "That is true of all such events from the Russian heat wave of 2010, to the drought and heat waves in Australia." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The report itself is more nuanced than the coverage.  What is clear is that climate models did not predict this drought.  That could mean that the underlying destabilization of the planet's climate patterns is well understood, and this drought was a once-in-x-hundred years anomaly.  Or, it could mean that the energy build-up associated with the net absorption of solar energy, leads to even greater non-linear complexity than can be simulated by current models.  Trenberth's reaction is conjectural.  It is not the outcome of a fully modeled analysis.  That does not mean it is wrong -- or right.  The test will be whether this extreme departure from prediction is, in fact, a singularity, or, the harbinger of unpredicted climate catastrophes coming at accelerated frequency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The present system places all of the risk of re-entering the labor force on the worker.  Not only is the job market precarious, but people often do not know whether they can sustain a work effort that would compensate for the loss of disability payments.  Under such complex and uncertain conditions,  designing a system that is both worker-friendly and work-friendly is not simple.  What needs to be replicated on a large scale is the personal concern and knowledge that exists in a primary group like a family or closely-knit community, where the well-being of each member is viewed holistically, entailing both productive work and health, and both risks and rewards are shared. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the explanation.  There is no market for inferior goods. Minimizing global warming is my own priority.  That requires global action.  Local U.S. mandates won't get the global buy-in needed.  If there is a political will for it, the high cost for developing a non-fossil fuel alternative for transportation should be a public cost -- like defense. The U.S. should be a player but not the only one in this planetary defense effort.  Once developed, a competitive reliable electric vehicle would then be able to make it on its own in the world market. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the article: Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla., said he had never seen large investors purchase so many homes in one fell swoop, giving them such great sway over pricing in the market. A lot of the price increase is not due to a market that is getting healthy, but is due to the influx of hedge funds, and a high percentage of homes are selling at artificially inflated values, Mr. McCabe said.

<TEXT> The climate bell tolls for us first-worlders too.  It is pure money illusion to think that our "wealth" is real if the productive basis for meeting real needs is lost -- not only through climate change but also the waste of natural and human resources that accompanies our economic system.  That system (private capitalist, or state capitalism as in China and the old USSR) allocates resources based on the cornucopian assumption of unlimited supply.  It is assumed that there will always be a substitute or a technological advance called forth by profit or command.  The credibility of that assumption is now reaching its limits.  Coping with the complexity is getting increasingly harder to do -- which is seen in money terms as more costly.  Projection without vision is the surest path to destruction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What was the state secret that Bradley Manning revealed?  It was the reality of war itself -- a carnage machine without purpose that destroys souls as well as lives, and creates only enemies. War is an attack on reason, and in that war Bradley Manning has unsheathed the weapon of knowledge.  He has denied all of us the comfort of claiming we didn't know.  He has forced us to face the reality of war, and to recognize that silence is complicity.  His selfless and noble act fully deserves the Peace Prize.

<TEXT> This shows the downside of the Chinese state capitalist model when applied to developing new technology for a green economy.  They understand how to ramp up production but do not understand what they can't control -- how that product can be successfully marketed.  If China had committed itself to bearing the high initial price of photovoltaic electricity as part of a long term plan for sustainable development, they would not have precipitated a collapse in the market price of solar panels, nor depended on exports for that market.  But state capitalism, like private capitalism, can only imagine short- to medium-term profits.  Neither can plan for a future in which production must be structured differently from the present.  There are too many unknowns.  Long-term planning cannot be assumed away if the world is to manage climate change and resource constraints.  No existing political-economic system is prepared to take on this task. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my perspective, shared religion is not the only basis for human solidarity.  Social movements like the great mobilizations for civil rights in the '60s and  labor organization in the '30s, were made possible because people saw that what they needed could only be achieved through social change, requiring both (1) belief in the rightness of the cause, and (2) collective action.  While social movements often devolve  into bureaucratic institutions with much-diminished moral authenticity, the same is true for most religions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The tragedy of Newtown should be the end of Gun Entitlement and a return to the original purpose of the Second Amendment, which says: "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."  It is the Federal government which is prohibited from infringing on the rights of states to form arms-bearing peoples militias. 
One way to return to the original sense of the Amendment is for states now to establish such voluntary militias.  A well-regulated militia, like any arm of the state, must have rules.  Thus the bearer of arms also bears a responsibility as a member in a state's voluntary militia, to act in accordance with the rules of that militia.  Establishment of a people's militia could provide the opportunity for everyone to receive training, not only in the use and care of weapons, but also in emergency response of the kind needed in an age of increased extreme weather (think of the inadequate response during and after Hurricane Sandy).  It would thus provide an organized network of people who have chosen to serve in times of public need.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are at the end of an Age of Ideology whose faith was anchored in the Wisdom of the Market.  It trained us to become increasingly dependent upon the growing fortunes of the rich.
The real world has shaken that faith, but it remains essentially intact.
This election has made taxing the rich thinkable, but it has not changed who rules, and for whom. Obama now wants to allow marginal tax rates to return to pre-Bush levels for the top 2%.  But that's not enough to fix the deficit.  
Now consider what would happen if tax rates were set to return the U.S. to its pre-1980 income distribution.
The Congressional Budget Office estimate is that the top 1 percent's share has more than doubled from 8 percent to 17 percent.  The system that produced that exploding inequality has been fraught with speculative bubbles and financial crises.  That the two phenomena coincide is not a coincidence.  Profit-driven expansion, made without considering any systemic consequences, is a recipe for overshoot and crash.
Tax away the excess now going to the top 1%, bringing them back to their pre-Reagan income share, and you have more than eliminated the current deficit, with lots of funds left over to invest in the infrastructure required  for a sustainable economy for the 21st century.  The key to that new economy is  eliminating the waste of scarce resources -- energy, environment, talent.  We have to focus on real needs  -- building healthy livable communities.  When considering that task, it is clear that the rich have done a god-awful job.  It is time for them to give up their baseless sense of entitlement to rule, and to seek honest employment mobilizing our productive forces for the work that must be done.

The drillers punched so many holes and extracted so much gas through hydraulic fracturing that they have driven the price of natural gas to near-record lows. And because of the intricate financial deals and leasing arrangements that many of them struck during the boom, they were unable to pull their foot off the accelerator fast enough to avoid a crash in the price of natural gas, which is down more than 60 percent since the summer of 2008. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Paraphrased from the article: $1 billion spent on the military generates ~11,200 jobs within the US economy. But that same $1 billion could create 16,800 clean energy jobs, 17,200 jobs in healthcare, or 26,700 jobs through support of education.

<TEXT> It is hard to imagine that a Constitution that requires amendments be approved by 38 of the 50 states would find sufficient support for the simple abolition of the Electoral College system, which over-weights the power of voters in two-thirds of the states.

A more modest reform may, however, be palatable. We learned from the recent Greek elections that under their system the party with the most votes gets a 50-seat bonus in Parliament. A similar formula might be possible here. 

For example, an additional 438 votes could be allocated in proportion to the popular vote. For the most part, these electors would cancel each other out. But if the popular tally were in the opposite direction from the Electoral College, then the candidate with the greater popular vote would pick up one more elector for each 700,000 votes that candidate had accrued greater than their opponent. This would also give representation in the Electoral College for third and fourth party candidates who garnered more than 700,000 votes nationally. In this close election, both the Libertarian and Green parties would have a shot at making a difference in the final outcome, without being labelled as spoilers. The whole process would be invigorated and American voter participation rates could once again demonstrate that we act as citizens of one country, and that we do give a damn about the direction our nation takes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the painful follow-up to Kristof's powerful column, A Possibly Fatal Mistake.  Scott Androes was a risk-taker.  But the gambling table was rigged. "Your money or your life" is not an easy question to answer if the money is more than you can afford, and the risk to your life appears remote.  Scott could not afford to play it safe, and he lost.
In this column Kristof responds to the many heartless comments his first column evoked.  Perhaps, out of this dialogue, we can identify a new social disease: Empathy Deficit Disorder.  It is the disease of the socially atomized who do not understand that their lives depend on the existence of a functioning human society, where empathy is the glue.  For a while, for some individuals EDD works just fine.  Some even become rich.  But if too many people feel and think and act this way, human society collapses into the dystopian ideal: The War of All Against All -- Winner Take All. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The applicability of Iceland's model to other places depends less on the size of its population and more on the resiliency of its domestic economy.  
Can it earn enough foreign exchange by selling goods and services that other people want to cover vital import needs -- food, energy, advanced technology, medicine, etc.?
Governments should have the welfare of their own people as their highest priority.  But after the post-2008 financial meltdown, each country at risk has been forced to sacrifice its people in order to prevent a loss of confidence in the world capital market.  The highest priority has therefore been to avert contagion which could spread to many countries.  The true loyalty of nation states has thus been revealed.  Capital rules.
No people with any dignity would submit to such a loss of sovereignty without a fight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Romney is holding back -- limiting his definition of the government-dependent class to 47%.  But according to the article, Ryan goes all the way:
 
    A full 70 percent of Americans get more benefits in dollar value from the federal government than they pay back in taxes, Mr. Ryan said in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute...

So for Romney-Ryan Republicans the question becomes: What good are these 70%?  Why do successful profitmaking Americans allow them to exist?   
At the very least they should be denied the vote.  That part of the plan is already in progress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Todd Akin is not an outlier in the anti-abortion world. The belief that pregnancy only occurs when a woman is "open" to it is a foundational myth. It simplifies the morality of forcing women to bear the fruit of conception: they wanted it when it happened, and now they are responsible for the result of their moment of passion. If you believe that, then there are no "unwanted" pregnancies -- only a moral failure to take responsibility for one's own actions. And the Republican Party has made this part of their implicit articles of faith. It is the only moral basis for denying women the right to abortion, even for pregnancies from "nonconsensual" sex. For more moderate Republicans, women must at least prove "forcible rape" to be allowed to terminate a forced pregnancy. If the rapist does not concur with that allegation, then the woman's case must presumably rest on the results of a trial and conviction -- a process likely to take more than nine months.

Its core ingredient  bitumen  is not pumped from wells but is strip-mined or boiled loose underground.... At room temperature, bitumen has the consistency of peanut butter, thick enough to hold in your hands. To get it through pipelines, liquid chemicals must be added to thin it into whats known as dilbit, short for diluted bitumen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> WP: Although the 75 percent tax on earnings over $1.23 million a year, up from a previous top marginal rate of 48 percent, is more a political symbol than an economic measure - because it raises too little money to make a dent in France's funding needs - analysts say it will help give Hollande political cover to cut government spending and open the labor market, making France more competitive with its neighbors... Hollande's advisers ... have signaled that they will cut employers' required social-safety-net contributions and shift more of the burden onto workers.

<TEXT> The desperate clutching for measures to restore Confidence does not inspire confidence.  The discipline of the market -- letting credit markets collapse -- is the cure that kills the patient.  The alternative being proposed is "unlimited funding" -- the abandonment of all market discipline. That could lead to unlimited indebtedness which gets monetized into unlimited inflation.  But probably the funding will be restrained by a political imposition, allocating funding in accord with political power.  This is where international democratic socialism starts to look like a less corrupt, more transparent way to go (a la Syriza in Greece).  Stay tuned. </TEXT>
