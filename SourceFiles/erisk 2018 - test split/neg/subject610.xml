<TEXT> Movies like that give much needed perspective. I would love for it to foster an honest conversation with reasonable people. Rhetoric of today destroys that perspective and divides us all when unity is what is needed. The SJW usefulness withers and dies when we are not at each other's throats being divisive and racist. They exaggerate our differences and fabricate malice to inflate their cause and usefulness. We are individuals. When you begin your declaration by talking to a specific race and stigmatizing them all with a demoralizing stigma, then you are racist. We are individuals. Our unity threatens the SJW. Race relations in the real world have only gotten better with time. The degree that they will continue to improve will be in spite of the SJW, not because of.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are these supposed to prove? I find all of these things disgusting. I voted for Bernie and Hillary. Is this proof of racism? Here we go. 

Fails to disavow support of the KKK-- Trump  

That makes his shameful, not racist. It is also a voting tactic. He is not a good person, did you figure that out?

Attacks Muslim gold star parents-- Trump  

They were worse than him. Why the fuck does what they say hold any water because their son died in battle. They used the death of their son as political influence and that is disgusting. Just using the name "gold star parents" is disgraceful. If we are talking about the sacrifice they made in losing a child in war, fine. Don't use the death of someone who is not here to advance your political ideology. I despise Trump, but I despise this as well.  

Attacks federal judge saying that because he is Mexican, he can't be impartial  

People lied about his comments regarding Mexico. People in powerful positions. They were bad enough on their own. They were in fact not racist. He shouldn't say that his comments would influence a judge because he is Mexican, but it is not an outrageous statement. It shouldn't be said, but look at who we are dealing with. 

A ban on travel that has been legally determined by the United States judicial system to have a religious basis in part because of the many, many repetitions of the exact phrase "Muslim ban"  

I disagree with the judge. I think the ban was a horrible idea. The fact that 100% of Jihadists are Muslim remains. The way he dealt with it is wrong. The vast majority of Muslim majority countries had no travel ban. This is a dishonest way to stop him from doing something stupid.   

I don't have time to go over every one of these things. You should just give your best three. This is exhausting.  I simply don't have the time to address all this. I appreciate the time you took to send it though. I hope you understand and hope you don't see it as an inability to discuss it. I agree with some things and disagree with others.  

One thing we agree on, I cannot wait until he is out of office.   </TEXT>

Not too far, lies. Outright slander. Often to people on topics that both are totally void of anything racial. 

they fail to actually explain the pile of racist bullshit they've pulled  

Demonstrate it and talk about it.  

Explai Trump calling Obama a Kenyan Muslim. How is that not based on racism?

Or? Calling swaths of voters stupid and having it become part of a political parties rhetoric is what got two time Obama voters to vote for Trump. You let me know what else got two time Obama voters to vote for him, because that is what they are telling you. Tell me how they are lying and what the real reason is. Entire counties that went to Obama TWICE went for Trump. How about people looking at safe spaces, deplatforming speakers, false accusations of racism, bigotry, homophobia, islamophobia, white supremacy, and fucking Naziism recoiling for the blinding stupidity. They may have seen Trump as the lesser of two evils. What do people like you do? Convince them that they are wrong? Nope, you insult them. 

The only way forward is for people like you to own your mistakes. Telling you that you are fucking up, or have fucked up, is not calling you stupid. It is asking you to change.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Surely you see that the very hyperbolic language you're using is, itself, a means to halt dialogue and an excuse to stop listening?

Nonsense. Be specific. The mentality is poisonous because it tries to silence people. Objecting to that is not halting dialogue. 

I'm not saying there isn't an underlying kernel of truth  

It is just true. Be specific. What is the kernel? 

but you're literally doing that which you rail against  

Not in the least. Demonstrate this in any way shape or form. Objecting to what they do is not doing what they do. You are embarrassing yourself. 

inflammatory but meaningless moralizing

<TEXT> So you didn't listen to it. Gotcha. It is a poisonous mentality that is infecting public opinion to the point of enough people recoiling from it giving us Trump as a president. Dishonestly restating their position is a demonstration of what they said. That is, if you actually listened, which I am sure you didn't.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  When convincing someone of something your argument is irrelevant, it's about how willing they are to hear what you have to say, and whether they feel attacked.

First off, it depends who you are talking to. Second off, they are often not the only ones listening. Third off, your argument may take multiple times. Fourth off your argument might fucking suck. 

Arguing isn't a zero sum game, you can't win most of the time, most you can do is pass some time and realize how dumb someone is.

Just read that back. If you cannot figure out the flaw in it, read it again. Just keep doing that.  </TEXT>

No person has a right to be heard or their ideas to be discussed though.  

Exactly. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO. Get it motherfucker? It is really that easy. They don't have the right to make you listen to them. They are not trespassing, they are invited. Just because someone disagrees does not mean they have the right to shut them down. 

Silencing them helps nurture bad ideas because you shelter them better ideas. Where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, I fucking said it in the first post I put. If you are going to keep going in circles, then just stop wasting our time.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Because of the standards that society places on how women

Which is exaggerated and is equally contributed to by women themselves. The same standard is put on men. We hold ideals for every aspect of life, whey shouldn't we for appearance. I don't look like models who sell my clothes. I don't have the abs, I don't have the jaw, and I am not as tall. But I want them to sell my clothes. 

Dustin realizes that these standards have effectively prevented him from interacting with women who, while he might not be attracted to physically, might have liked personally very much.  

No, Dustin's own prejudiced has. He is very sneakily trying to pin the responsibility on society instead of faulting on one of the simplest lessons we have all learned as children. It is very subtle what he did.

EVEN IF he was placing the responsibility solely on himself, which I don't think he is, he is exaggerating to a degree where mockery is appropriate. He is distorting reality, and exaggerating his own emotion in order to gain attention by showcasing how virtuous he is.  </TEXT>

This is the majority. People who stray from it like to pretend that it doesn't exist. Just because there is variation to the majority doesn't mean you cannot have a conversation about the majority.  

Can we stop this already? Seriously. Nobody every means "everyone", they are talking about the majority. When will this shit stop? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is nothing shocking in this what so ever. People are not behaving ignorantly, they are acting quite reasonably to the norms of human psychology. On the social media front, it is a fraction of a hair or a fraction of a hair in the timeline of our communication with one another. We need to adapt to it. I use it as a tool. If we are more aware of our tendencies, then we an adapt to the pressures that our outside environment has. I only use Twitter for politics and make sure half of the people I follow I disagree with. 

So you value your opinion? Do you think you think things through and don't let nonsense influence your opinion? Read ["Thinking Fast and Slow"](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555). You wont trust yourself for shit anymore. You will be more cautious on quick opinions and try very hard to reserve judgement and rely on the "thinking slow" part of your brain". Sad part is, even when you know about your brains tendencies, you are still victim to them 80% of the time.   </TEXT>

Complete bullshit. This includes your own actions. I predict you don't check a percentage in the high 90's of what you buy to make sure the workers are paid an ethical wage. Because you did in the single digits you think you can wag your finger. Your own hypocrisy dismisses your accusations of being unethical because you are a participant. You are calling a double standard that you are complicit in. You choose to acknowledge it only when it is convenient and when it denounces others and not yourself.

<TEXT> Everything you fucking wear is. I despise this administration but people hold others to standards that only matter to them when they want to criticize them. Are the people outraged buying only American or researching everything to make sure the workers are being paid a fair living wage? It is only an issue when you want to demonize someone, but every other day you use your iPhone and wear your clothes.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So tell me, when was the last time you were followed around a store by an employee for the duration of your visit?

I don't believe half the people who claim this. The people who do it legitimately? How were they dressed? If a white person is dressed like an asshole, they are followed too. This is nonsense. Possible, but not a huge problem. 

Please also see prison populations and the gender wage gap.  

You did zero research on the gender rage gap. ZERO. Black people commit 50% of all violent crime at 13% of the population. Instead of lying about this, be honest and try to help communities in trouble. People like you keep help from communities like this. 

White male privilege is a thing. I'm sorry you're not seeing it.  

I explained in detail why it is not. Responding with "it is a thing" is meaningless.  </TEXT>

1. They are statistically more likely to shoot white people when controlled for violent crime rate. 
2. People dismiss past records when citing statistics. 
3. Profiling is not irrational, it is inconvenient. This is the ONLY one you may have room to argue.

<TEXT> Because white privilege doesn't exist. Civil rights are guaranteed to all, period. When they are taken away from a group of people, the other people are not privileged because everyone gets them. It is a racist and divisive term used to absolve people from being racist and satisfy some sort of sick masochistic racism desire. If you have any suspicion that male privilege is a complete exaggerated bullshit, just spend 5 minutes looking up people arguing against it. If you come back with straw men arguments like "so I guess racism doesn't exist" or "so I guess misogyny has ended" you can fuck off.  You have just demonstrated that you are dishonest and have no intention of having an honest conversation.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was banned in r/adviceanimals for offering statistics to a topic. 

I was banned in r/food for making a joke to the OP, that broke no rules, the OP confirmed he was on board with, for being offensive.



I was banned in r/atheism for clearly defining the behavior I notice in a group of people (people who say Merry Christmas) as a direct attack at the OP.   

When I was banned in one of those, I was unable to comment BACK to someone in the room. They initiated the contact. So I PMed them with "I was banned in the room. I assume you reported me? If you would like a response to your comment to me, let me know, and I will be happy to".  Then I was told by them and the mod that I harassed them. It is a shit show people.  

You simply cannot disagree, joke, or be on the wrong side of the fence of any issue or you will be banned. If you respectfully object, with no swearing, ad hominem attacks, or even coarse language, you will be permanently banned. All you have to do is disagree. I had one mod insist I apologize to them. For what? Saying the ban was unjust. 

You have no power in the situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The path is reasonable

You simply do not know anything about the path. It can take up to a decade and almost guaranteed to spit up families in a significant amount of circumstances. You are knowingly being dishonest right now.  Even many of the GOP thinks it needs reformation. 

More reasonable that 99% of the countries in the world.  

That is not true in the least. It is also not an argument. Your words imply such disdain I don't even know what to take seriously. To argue for a reasonable path is to not argue for something that is not stringent.  The Netherlands is very difficult, but reasonable. 

The problem is when people think citizenship is somehow owed to them.  

I see gist of what you are saying and don't disagree to a point with certain people, not immigrants in general. I will ignore you being a dick while saying it.

<TEXT>  Inviting an academic or professional to make a presentation based on more than sensationalism seems a little more appealing.

I agree. You and people who feel the same can invite someone like that. 

Conservatism has a profoundly intellectual foundation. Maybe those of opposing viewpoints that attend the event would be interested by it. 

That is currently not allowed in college campuses. Conservative papers by the students are trying to be banned.   I advocate what you are saying here. I do not get to say what qualifies or not. 

Having a speaker that is looking to further polarize the sides is counterproductive.   

No it isn't. It challenges your stance. If you cannot argue Ann Coulters points, you are the problem, not her.   </TEXT>

The only people who want to stop them are the ones who are too lazy, too stupid, and too terrified to form an argument of their own. If you cannot argue against racism objectively with a rational and well crafted argument then you should volunteer to go away. Shame should keep you away. That is an emotion that has been destroyed by the "everybody gets a trophy" movement. The problem is, they have no argument for calling people racist who are not. The even bigger problem, they have no argument for calling the people racist who are. The easiest topic to denounce. They are empty handed.   </TEXT>

You are childish. Literally huh? Hmmm you are not using the word as the accepted figuratively and you are not clarifying hyperbole. Are you just trying to sound dramatic? How cute. 

You answered nothing, suggested things I don't think or believe, and you're acting like a douche bag. I am not going to waste anymore time clarifying your ignorant assumptions about what I think that you could not possibly know.    </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice driving across America please? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have summers off. I was thinking about renting a car one way to drive across the country and flying back.  The one way charge is insane!!! $250 to $500 drop off fee and triple the daily rate. I could take my own car that has about 30K but I am committed to both ways then. If I did 10 days it is like $900 for the car. I can fly a lot of places for that lol.  

Any advice on renting something cheaper?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am procrastinating so much, goddammit Reddit.  

That he told them? Absolutely. That he told them first? Hmmm did some fish get left out of the fridge?  

I am unclear of what you mean hear. He had to tell the Russians. That has consequences in the effectiveness of your strike. War is messy, war with Russia is messier.  

Well, if Assad was the target, I might not mind too much, but Ive a hunch that wont happen.  

You are smarter than this. You know that is not how it works. If the US did something they don't target the president. 

Hes been gassing Syrians since at least 2013 and in all that time,  

Yes? I think something should have been done. Obama is probably my favorite man alive, but I disagree with this. Well, he did ask congress. So, that is what you need to do. It is so hairy. 

its not in the USs interests. Bad things will happen. Stay out.  

These were chemical attacks on his watch AFTER he was supposed to have gotten rid of them. He never said "I will do nothing if they use chemical weapons again". EVEN IF, as much as I hate the man, you learn new things when you are actually in the office. This should surprise nobody. 

What makes these gassed babies different from all of those other gassed babies? Could it be to do with the timing?  

Congress didn't approve it. Both sides agree there was no time for congressional approval for what Trump did and Democrats even support it. Are you suggesting retroactive attacks for past attrocities? The time came and went and we opted to not do anything. So yes, those dead babies had no consequence. 

If you don't think he did enough, then I think that is good. He needs congress. It was a reasonable measured response. We will have 4 years of fuck ups, I am not in a hurry.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  He gave the Kremlin notice of the attack before congress.

Do you have any idea how fucking important this is? The results of not doing that could have been catastrophic. Without going into detail, with Russia, let's just say we have to be cautious even if it sidesteps our military strategy. 

Actually, Im all for that part  

When you are complicit in a chemical weapons attack, retaliation will and should kill people.  

But; 60 Tomahawks and none of them were aimed at the runways. Apparently. And a good number of the aircraft werent hit, including some that were in the open.  

Pretty sure this is accurate. 

The airfield was  apparently  completely functional, less than a day later.  

I have to confirm this. Everyone is so fucking polarized I am just trying to find news sources that are not skewing the story in the way they tell it. I am on the left, but NPR can get too liberal with their commentary in NYC. But the news portion seems no nonsense and I have never thought after, well that was misleading. BBC and AP too I guess. It just has to be a smorgasbord with a bit of skepticism and common sense to be able to have a reasonable conversation with people like you. 

Thanks for not being a dick.

<TEXT> Ignorant? NO!!!!! You are identifying the problem. Sugar is killing you. You are addicted to it. Anything that releases dopamine in your brain is hard to quit. It won't be easy. Just know that craving is in your head. It is chemicals. Identifying it helps wean yourself off it little by little. You start to see it as something tangible, therefore something you can overcome. 

So what do you do when your body pressures you? Exercise is huge and not going too long between meals. Healthy meals with lean protein and LOTS of veggies. If you can keep your heart rate at 80% maximum for 40 minutes six days a week, the cravings will have the edge taken off as long as you eat healthy after you exercise.  

Fill your house with healthy food. Like I said, Costco if you have one. Frozen organic veggies. They wont spoil an they are in the house. Also, EAT FAT (as long as you cut out the sugar). If you find yourself successful at eating no sugar, increase your fat. Avocado, nuts, and coconut oil. Do not combine fat with sugar!  

You can do it! 

Edit: Trust me, I understand addiction, recovered alcoholic here.  </TEXT>

No, just going to it. It is avoidance. Leaving it does not imply you are confronting anything.  

But I don't see how simply being in a safe space occasionally robs you of an opportunity to grow.  

Shocker.  

Many people travel but also own a home. They go out and experience other cultures, but sometimes they just want to go home and sleep in their own bed for a little while between trips.  

What are you talking about? 

One does not have to be in the mood for adventuring 100% of the time,   

Again, what? Are you even responding to the right person?

particularly if one is injured and needs a little time to heal.  

Injured? Heal? From what? Were you in a fight or were your feelings hurt?

You knew what that meant. Did you think I wouldn't clarify it? People like you are so strange, I'll never understand. Who does it work on? 

I was comparing her with the type of people I am suspecting criticizing her. It is speculation. But you knew that didn't you? 

OP was-sorry  

What?

is an attention whore  

Nothing in the photo brought attention to her identity, anything sexual, no cleavage, no crotch shot with a pet, nothing. It shows her fucking back and she is flashing the wilderness. There is ZERO connection to her identity. You are empty handed motherfucker, and threatened by her too.  

is an attention whore

<TEXT>  People are criticising and downvoting it for it being so pretentious and attention seeking.

It isn't, and I explained as much. You are identifying nothing about the picture that fits this description. 

It's also interesting how you define how valuable a person is by whether they've lost their virginity. I think that says more about yourself than the people you're insulting blindly with no evidence.  

Here we go, victimization. That may or may not be an assault on their character, as is their assault on her character for the false accusation with nothing in the picture to support it. I was insulting them. Got that? For reason. If they are virgins and just young, they don't know fuck about life and it was more of identifying that. If they are old, they have no business judging someone having fun when they are so inept they cannot fulfill the most basic human desire. Fuck them. 

Do whatever you want but don't post it on a public site and not expect people to give their honest opinion.  

I didn't expect them not to. I am telling them they are baseless and come from an empty and weak place.  If they want to make baseless insults in public, then guess what chief, they have to take the blow back too.  

Also the fact she got this photo taken which appears to have taken at least a few minutes of planning. Instead of enjoying it she got a picture to show off.

You have no way of knowing that and common sense does not even suggest it. You've got nothing! How about she was with her friend an did something spontaneous and the friend took her phone out and took a pic because it was fun and funny. Showing off what? As I said before, she offered nothing for self gratification. 

You think you have an argument here? Are you taking the high ground? Nope. You are as empty and vile as the rest of them only you calculated a bullshit denial to avoid the deserved condemnation. Like I said, you've got nothing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't let this progressive babble fool you even if you hate Trump. They are using the unlikability of Trump to push a false narrative that enables women to continue to be persecuted globally under the guise of feminism. 

The majority of women who wear this horrific symbols of female oppression are done under horrific force. [Acid attacks and assassination](http://freethinker.co.uk/2016/10/03/the-disappeared-the-veil-and-the-erasure-of-the-female-body/), torture devices called the biter that rips skin off for violation of dress codes like [here](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/isis-terror-thugs-cut-womens-7445632).  

Maybe you need proof it can be [justified in their religious doctrine?](http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/veils.aspx). Wait, maybe you can dismiss what I say because I am not the appropriate race, religion, or gender, even though you don't know what that is. [Take it from a Muslim woman.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/12/21/as-muslim-women-we-actually-ask-you-not-to-wear-the-hijab-in-the-name-of-interfaith-solidarity/?tid=ss_fb utm_term=.5acb36373ad5).  

If you live in a country where you can wear it by choice, do it. When you begin to claim that it is a symbol of feminism when so many women are tortured and suffer under this nameless cloak, then you are a monster. All you have is your false narrative. All you have is "islamophobe" in lieu of an argument. You can criticize oppressive, barbaric, and violent tenets of a religion and advocate for it's reformation. That is in support of the modern Muslims living in society fighting against things like this such as Maryam Namazie and Ayan Hersi Ali.  

Is it too much to ask for people to acknowledge these women's suffering. Are you going to call me a racist, bigot, or islamophobe for asking you to? This needs to stop. Your obfuscation can only work for so long because the suffering of the women globally is not hidden and you will be exposed for the deranged monsters you are enabling the horrific treatment of women under the name of feminism.  </TEXT>

You are so enamored with the act of virtue signaling that you wont take the 2 minutes to look something so important up. You don't care about women, you care about your narrative and you are scum. 

You can start with these multiple examples of many religions with[this](http://britishasiansuk.com/girl-in-viral-twerking-video-says-she-is-sorry-during-interview-with-youtuber-ali-dawah/), [this](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/8-year-old-israeli-girl-face-clash-moderates-ultra-orthodox-jews-article-1.997389), [this](https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/25/indonesian-womens-rights-under-siege), or maybe you are into [stoning women to death in Iran](https://iranhr.net/en/articles/2790/). [Maybe you need acid attack or assassination for not being veiled?](http://freethinker.co.uk/2016/10/03/the-disappeared-the-veil-and-the-erasure-of-the-female-body/), [or maybe a torture device that clips womens hands for not wearing gloves?](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3463337/My-sister-punished-biter-not-wearing-gloves-pain-worse-labour-Teacher-fled-ISIS-describes-torture-device-clips-women-s-flesh-bodies-aren-t-concealed.html) 

The fact that you have the nerve to demand links on such a widespread problem and don't have the common decency to spend two minutes of your life to look anything up is absolutely disgusting. I HATE these atrocities, yes. People like you who enable, and apologies for these barbarians are worse than the actual barbarians. You assist the suffering of women globally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is patently untrue

This? What part of what I said. Nothing I said was untrue. This should be fun. 

FoxNews, Breitbart, Rush, etc. consistently obsess over the religion of Islamic attackers  

They are disgusting news organizations but I will not dismiss something that is true. You know who also says it is the religion. The fucking terrorists. 

[How about what they said after Brussels and Paris?](http://imgur.com/ZF7P9H3)  

[How about what they said after Nice?](http://imgur.com/HPGak5r)  

But wait, maybe what you need is an itemized list of what they said with grievances listed in order of dislike having doubled down on the fact that it is religion multiple times? Nah, that cannot exist. 

(NSFL) [Oh look it exists](http://clarionproject.org/factsheets-files/islamic-state-magazine-dabiq-fifteen-breaking-the-cross.pdf) 

KNow why I had to put NSFL? There are graphic pictures of beheading. It is explicitly told in great detail to PEOPLE LIKE YOU why they are doing it. 

People like you waste their time obfuscating everything and calling everyone bigots when the fast majority of sane people who oppose this nonsense support the reformation of Islam. You are sickening. Muslims suffer the most from people like this, and people like you enable them.  </TEXT>

By what standard? You are just blindingly ignorant to toddlers and are trying to assert some arbitrary rule on the developmental psychology of a child that does not exist. Every parent it not given a blank slate. 

Fuck My niece was like 12 months and they taught her basic sign language,... she shit her pants she signed it didn't sit there and cry,, she was hungry,, she signed it... and it isn't uncommon now adays to do this, I know a ton of people that do it.  

What kind of grammatical clusterfuck was that? So yeah, cool story, but that means nothing and does not refute my point.  

also there were people boarding behind them, step to the side in the terminal and get your kid calmed down then board .. be considerate of other people

 You are not the respectable one here. Step aside where? It's obvious you have never had a kid, other than being an expert because of your niece, but now I wonder if you have ever been on a plane. 

I hope someone like you is on board when someone like me is on board and you try to embarrass a person like that. You will lose.  </TEXT>

No, these are adults. You don't need to have kids to understand that children don't have mental capacity or life experience to react to situations proportionately to their severity. Kind of like you. Irony again?

That and her whole love speech in that movie were infuriating but other that that I think it was a masterpiece. This scene is absolutely necessary and had time constraints to a 3 hour movie. I let it go because he is selling this to the public and things need to be explained to them. He cannot just assume everyone is up on their science game.  

Cooper should really already know this stuff, considering the whole mission revolves around him being able to fly through a wormhole.

<TEXT> The subjective fact I will disagree with. But storytelling has an identity and definition to which he mastered and rose above do to a mastery of the concept. 

ehh  

Another point that can be argued to be objective. There is what the industry produced, and there is the comparison of what he does to that that delineates whether or not he was creative. He is.   

The other two yeah but this one no.  

The other two yeah? You just responded in so many words "no". Are you drunk. But again, this is a testament to his creativity. Inception has spectacular attention to detail in plot flow and also jumped around in levels of a dream. Not only was that fucking creative, we can all wait for any suggestions on how it could be smoother. Tick tock....

<TEXT> It's a never ending battle.  

It feels like it yes. Right around a year you will realize you are a new person. You wont know when it happened, you wont be able to pinpoint it, you will just know it was a long journey. 

First and foremost, get regular therapy. If you cannot afford it, go to AA. It has A LOT of problems but the most significant thing about it is hearing other people talk and, here is the hard part, sharing yourself. Talking it out is 90% of psychotherapy. 

Exercise, and do it every day. Intense cardio for 40 minutes, no excuses. The insanity videos are great for this. You will feel like you are going to die, I promise you, but don't allow any excuses. Exercise is the single more effective tool you can use. I am alive today because of it.  Read this.

[Spark](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain-ebook/dp/B000SFD21Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1489951001 sr=1-1 keywords=spark)

Read all the science about it you can. Know what is going on in your brain. So much easier to ignore the voice in your head when you know why you have it. You judge yourself less and know it is just an anomaly of of an evolutionary process hijacked by a substance.  Read these to start.

[The Chemical Carousel](https://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Carousel-Science-Beating-Addiction/dp/1439212996)

You have to attack this from all fronts. Relapse is part of it. DO NOT judge yourself for relapse. Get back to it and set your goals. Exercise every day, talk to someone every day, get therapy every week.  Eat right. Omega 3 and probiotics are huge. Also a vitiman called "Stress" of some form. They are high combos of B multi and C. Take it. 

The battle ends. You just can never drink again. I promise you, when you go at life without, you develop. You are stressed, you recover, you are stressed you recover. Every thing you used to do drinking you will knock out of the park sober. You just cannot avoid ANYTHING that scares you. You will be the better you and learn to deal.  

Hope this helps.

<TEXT>  Hate crimes aren't thought crimes. This ridiculous.

That wasn't my claim. You began by misrepresenting what I said. Fantastic. Hate is the thought that is smuggling into a crime like assault. Assault is the crime. 

We sentence people differently for the same crime depending on the victim and impact on society all the time.  

We sentence people on the severity and type of their crime. We classify intent, premeditation, and outcome. Not the thoughts of the perpetrator since they are impossible to prove in a court of law.  

 Is it assault or child abuse or domestic violence? Depends on who the victim is  

Are you arguing for my side now? Child abuse depends on age, not how much the person disliked the victim. Your second example, the same. Murder and terrorism are a horrible analogy because there can be terrorism without murder. This is all incoherent and irrelevant to anything I said. 

The law treats actions differently all the time.  

That is how we classify the crime, not the opinion of the person towards the victim. This is what I said before and this is the confusion where you either purposefully misrepresented my opinion or just don't understand. I think we know which.   

People only get pissy about it when criminal law is protecting people based on protected status, which again happens in all other areas of law.  

What?  

Feel free to have the last word. I don't have time to refute and sort out strings of irrelevant, conflated, and misrepresentations of my opinion. This will never work for you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Scum for pointing out what a shit person is doing to our country?

No, the scum reference was directed at overall behavior on both side to which this was an example and I stated reasons why. None of which were this. You are not good at this. 

Scum for proving how his vacations to his properties to make a buck can be used in different ways that HELP the poor and downtrodden?  

Here we go with the virtue signaling. I stated my case and you are addressing a straw man. 

Scum for knowing this buffoon of a man is soiling the country we live in for money?  

You are exhausting. I disagree with the majority, the vast majority of what he does. People are scum for lying about it and making it more difficult to condemn. 

Here is some advice. These tactics you are using will never work for you. You alienate people on your side trying to virtue signal and demonize others who are clarifying reality and actually are on your side. This is the scumminess I am referring to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still think this is insane. Hate crimes are nonsense. He committed a crime. Assessing his thoughts on a race are irrelevant. He should be charged with assault. Hate speech is not a crime, nor should it be. (Happy to admit I am wrong on this, as far as I know it is not). making hateful speech illegal is akin to thought crime. 

The degrees of murder have nothing to do with how the murder feels about the person, they delineate intent and planning. 1st premeditated, intentional, 2nd: not premeditated, intentional, Voluntary:  intentional with provocation, not premeditated, and Involuntary: Unintentional, not premeditated, and responsible for actions that resulted in a death. I may be off on a few things, but I am close. The person's hatred is irrelevant. People are sentenced on the severity of the crime and possibility of recidivism. 

Hate crimes are just smuggling in thought crimes and calling it something different. The institutional virtue signal. You don't stop bad ideas with enforcement and violating civil rights, you stop them with better ideas. If you cannot argue the case against racism, then go home, you don't belong in the conversation. If you think a racist cannot be talked out of it, then the fault is on you. After conversation comes violence. People who support nonsense like this are not responsible for racism, they are responsible for keeping it alive and suffocating the only thing that can kill it, reason.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The old Reddit go-to when they have no argument. "Why are you mad" or "You seem upset". Just so you know, that will never work. 

 and are using straw man arguments.  

Demonstrate where. Funny, you just had the opportunity to do that and you did not. I quoted what you said and responded to it.  

We clearly disagree, and neither of us are going to change our minds.  

I am happy to. You have offered nothing. You initially didn't address my points. Then you suggested that I was upset for responding, and now you are telling me you wont change your mind while insisting I share the same opinion. Are these the actions of someone who is on the right side of the issue with the superior stance? Nope. 

I'm gonna break it off here since you don't seem like you can discuss without cursing and acting childish  

Now you don't offer any counter argument because I used a swear word. Was it "bullshit"? I really wish this was farther up so you could be exposed for your ...brace yourself, bullshit. You got nothing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Sorry, but that's just wrong.

That? I didn't say one thing, I was actually addressing points from another person. What that? I said multiple things.

People can know the information but not remember it or not recall it in time due to stress.  

I didn't argue that. They really don't know it then. That is that. People wont forget their phone number under stress, you dont' forget your name, you don't forget your address. You don't forget things you invest time in. Sad to say, most of the people who spend sickening amounts of hours playing video games could ramble off specifics about it because they spend hours on it. They can do this under stress too. Stress causes people to forget things on the cusp of their memory. Game shows is a horrible analogy. If there were a game show on a topic where people can prepare and study before hand, it wouldn't be any fun. You can prepare enough to overcome the stress. 

Just because in your experience your grades are tied to your efforts, doesn't make that true for other people.  

I didn't make that claim, I just shared my experience. You have no argument so you have to suggest that. People don't invest the time in things they have to do. Because stress has some effect, people throw the baby out with the bathwater and say "well I am not a good test taker". Bullshit. If stress effects you in a test, you may have to study harder. There is a point you pass where stress will not compromise your memory or comprehension.  </TEXT>

I didn't' say it wasn't. 

Some people can know the information, but get caught up in the stress and formality of the test and can't get through it.  

They really didn't know the information. They barely knew the information. 

It isn't about effort for some people.   

Yes it is. Some may need more effort than others. Cry me a river.  

You don't rise to the level of your expectations, you fall to the level of your training.

Edit: I am not making the argument that stress does not effect memory. Most people get stressed because they are not prepared. I am saying it only effects the information on the cusp of memorization due to lack of effort. There is a point where stress wont be able to stop you from remembering. No test would stress you out to the point where you cannot remember your name, address, or phone number. For the lunatics that spend a sickening amount of hours on video games, there are things about that game you will absolutely never forget. Why? You spent hours on it. People use "I am a bad test taker" as an excuse for not putting in the effort. When you know your shit, and know it well, guess what you get less of? Stress.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Hate crimes influence sentencing, not verdict

I am no expert but I am pretty sure you are wrong and I have to go soon. Hate crimes are smuggling thoughts into sentencing and charging. Sentencing should be judged on the charge. If you beat someone up because of their race, your sentencing is based on the severity of the beating, premeditation, and a judge of weather you meant it or not, intent. If you are guilty, and you meant it, the charge is assault. Being charged with an unprovoked beating is the crime. All reasons, given it is unprovoked are ALL wrong and the measurement of them is nonsense. 


we wouldn't distinguish between types of murder either.  

Types of murder are distinguished on intent. Look them up. 

I will let you have the last word.  I have to go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This refutes nothing. I thought I said it to you. Intent is only for proving guilt or innocence of the assault. That is why there are degrees of murder. 1st degree is premeditated. If it was premeditated because you hate brown skin, blue eyes, or people who live on streets that go east and west, it doesn't matter. You are proving intent, the intent is all that needs to be proven. Second is another classification of intent. 

Your post has nothing to do with what I said. You got the last word. I don't have time for this. Enjoy.  </TEXT>

Yes. He should be charged with assault, that is what he did. If he did it for his race, revenge, rage, sexual preference, debt, or whatever, it is assault. It is illegal. You just want to suggest I am not concerned about racism because you are left with your dick in your hands to defend something as nonsensical as a "hate crime".

What a bunch of condescending bullshit. It is illegal in 49 states for a reason. People don't do it at safe speeds. Even after checking my mirror, they can approach at speeds faster than a check can keep it safe. The angle is not always able to see many cars back. Changing lanes is not safe with motorcycles going between cars. They simply  don't go slowly. 

The traffic case he is making is absolutely unnoticeable in any significant traffic and is smoke and mirrors.  I am so done with motorcyclists suggesting "you just don't get it".

<TEXT> The racism problem in America. It's annoying to keep saying, no I am not saying that it doesn't exist, but I am saying we have made continuing progress and are in the least racially divisive times we ever lived in. Don't let SJW's fool you, come here, walk around, we are a melting pot that is on the right track.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remember when America was? Jesus Christ SJW's view progress as something to be ignored and lied about. One would think the path to unity is to not, you know, divide. Acknowledge progress, celebrate it, encourage it, and move forward. But hey, demonizing harmless people who have no ill intent and calling people racists who are not is also a way to go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here we go. Where did I get mad at being called names? The post? You think that is what it is about? Then you are part of the problem if you think that is what it is about. Are you confusing objecting to the name? Is that how it works? Recently I reported someone (not you) because I have been banned for nonsense. I broke no rule and I can happily debate any of them if there were any use in it. I fucked up, I reported them because I was not mad at them, but mad that I was banned and missed me mark on my principles. Lesson learned. 

Did say "SJW" or did I use the term. Were they being an SJW? Is that even a derogatory term lol. Not that I am against insults, because sometimes the honest adjectives to describe your actions are not flattering, for me included. 
 
A library full of shit and the best you got is that I called someone an SJW? I gotta say, I love the internet. You are insanely misguided. Alt-right? That is the new way to refute an argument?

<TEXT>  Why does it seem like everyone under 21 has social anxiety?

Many people in their 20's too. Do you see that? I think many factors, but the main one is that the "Everybody gets a trophy" generation is all grown up. Our brains evolved to survive stress in an uncivilized society and in modern day life, it often misfires to things that are not threats. It would do this thousands of years ago but it can adjust for these things by a series of stresses and recoveries. You have to be introduced into some stress, respond with a stress response, and then see everything is OK. The next time your brain responds will less of an emergency response and that effect continues. 

Stress is only bad without the recovery. Children that are in unsafe environments that have no relief from the trauma because it is either constant or numerous are the ones who suffer from physical and psychological problems. 

The adults that raised the kids plagued with anxiety sheltered them. They robbed them of any opportunity to feel uncomfortable and acquire any of the skills they need to function in society. You have kids who are in their mid 20's having anxiety attacks opening up a bank account or having to make a phone call. 

We can blame the parents, that is fine, but once we recognize the problem, society doesn't change, they do.  It wont be easy because they are in an adult world with no adult skills and the solution is to not Nerf the world. If you do, you just keep them deprived of skills that were taken away from them and the rest of society suffers. We cannot enable. Make them do things, they will be fine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here we go. One bouncer does something stupid and now all your ignorant hysterics are justified. The bottom line is, the overwhelming majority of people support them, there is public outrage, it looks like the single individual was fired, and society is on their side. This is a story of triumph. 

SJW's will use this as a soundboard to propagate their ignorant false narrative instead of unifying with the reality of our society, we overwhelmingly support the gay community. This is poison to the SJW because their entire identities strive on outrage and a society plagued by bigotry and injustice. 

You are on the wrong side of history. We are better than you make us out to be. We are better than you need us to be to stay relevant. If you tried acting rationally and, oh I don't know, fucking voting, we wouldn't have Trump as a president.

Then people will be up in arms that nothing was done. Do you know how many fucking civilians are killed when troops are sent in. It's war motherfuckers.  You have people trying to kill as few innocents as possible to a faction that advocates for killing the most innocent people as possible and they suggest that the US are the worst terrorists in the world. Put down Noam Chomsky and think for yourselves. To be rational and discuss a single issue does not make you a Trump supporter or a Republican.

<TEXT>  Every single person who espouses some version of white nationalism necessarily has to endorse some form of ethnic cleansing.

That is a blind assertion to further demonize something that is already repugnant. You are creating sympathy by lying. 

This is because if you want a homogeneous ethno-state in a multi-ethnic society, it necessarily requires the cleansing of minority ethnicity in order to attain the ethnic homogeneity that you want.  

He argues otherwise. He is only significant because of people like you. You again, are blindly asserting this. Stop what you are doing and be fucking honest about what he does. You are only helping him by lying. How the fuck can people like you not see this. Was getting Trump elected not enough? You are all so self righteous there is no tragedy of outcome where you can honestly self examine your behavior.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is simple, pay attention. Keep in mind, I am liberal.

When hysteric reactionary children didn't google the word "nationalism" and apologetically calls people with nationalistic tendencies Nazi's, racists, bigots, and any other of their go-to list of babble.  

The other group of people, which are not identical but do overlap, are the Noam Chomsky readers who love to argue that America is some sort of evil empire who intentionally kill innocent people. These people don't think for themselves, they think what they are told.  

Lying about reality because you disagree with something causes your opposition to double down and match your irrationality with theirs. Now, if you just show support for your country, call out a mistruth about the "enemy", disagree on 1% of anything, you are called a Trump supporter or a Republican. That is how far the termites have spread.   </TEXT>

The dude is a white nationalist. Get real.  

Bingo! The only honest thing you said!! That is a fucking horrible thing to be! Congratulations. Go with that, take your new found honesty and run with it. 

Come on. Get real. Are you really trying to convince us that Richard Spencer is a boy scout?  

This is what everyone does when their dishonesty about bad people is exposed. Tell me I am doing something that I am not, or suggest I think something I don't. I am just telling you the importance of being honest about bad people.  That is where we are at? Gandhi? This is your counter argument for my advocacy of honesty for dangerous people. Fantastic.

That wasn't the arbitrariness I was referring to. I think you know that too. 

in a country and industry with a long history of racism.   

All history does. This industry is one of the most liberal and politically correct on the planet. 

That's like saying no one should have mentioned Obama was the first black president.  

No, no it is 100% nothing like that. The presidency is not an arbitrary classification. It is different in substance, accomplishment, power, institution, national (not industrial) acceptance, and a national conversation going on since the Civil Right Movement on when we will break free and allow the most powerful man in the world to be elected as a black men. Not a writer-directer to cross some made up glass ceiling. You are so full of shit, it is only forgivable if you are 12.

These types of beatings things are sanctioned by theocracies around the world and done in broad daylight. The comparison is laughable.

True liberals got lost somewhere in a pile of shit coming from the mouths of insecure douche bags trying to outdo each other with how virtuous they are.

What the fuck are you talking about?  

How are SJWs the best friend of racists?  

Use context clues, think, rinse and repeat. 

Telling racists they're racist helps them identify a flaw in their logic, ability to reason, and education I suppose (because most racist people have no idea that they're racist).  

They have to be racist. Ding ding!!!

SJWs help racists find one another I suppose, by giving them a common enemy.

The plot was disjointed, clunky and had no arc. The characters had almost zero development.  The intimacy was cheap and shallow and I see as an insult to the homosexual community. The third act was outrageously bad. It was stagnant, pointless, emotionless, meandering, and boring. It did a terrible job highlighting the humanity of the characters because of all these amateur film mistakes. It was outrageous that it got best picture.   </TEXT>

Depressingly, I did a really good job and we won the decision.  That didn't hurt things though, I made some points that I kind of agreed with and like always, it was a complicated issue with many nuances. 

I don't have an allegiance, but the reality is that the left aligns with what I believe in the most. It is the system we have. I have been called a Trump supporter so many times for showing the slightest bit of criticism of the left or not getting mad over something insignificant. I supported motherfucking Bernie!

<TEXT> You have the right idea. You have a good eye for texture and perspective.  [Here](http://imgur.com/OnKVZwL) I cropped it for you.  The nonsense in the bottom of the picture is gross and out of focus. You should check out "The rule of thirds", get really good at it, then break it artistically when you like.  I added a little blacks and corrected the white balance a tad but mainly it looks more pleasing because you get the texture of the wood as a feature and the framing is more pleasing.  Your depth of field is really shallow. Not necessarily a bad thing. Keep taking pictures!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You will not only get down voted, but you will probably be called a bigot. 

People are terrified to criticize a movie about a black gay person. We are in a climate where normal people are being called fucking Nazi's by major news outlets who are so far removed from being a Nazi I feel like we are in an alternate universe. I am not going to patronize wither culture and be honest about it. To the movie. 

The plot is clunky, disjointed, and undeveloped. I don't have any time to feel anything because nothing is developed. There is so little time to feel a relationship between the boy and Ali. The exaggerated gushing over how stunning and beautiful the story is boggles my mind. 

The third act was stagnant and useless to the story. It offered nothing to the characters relationship and had nothing to do with furthering the plot. The movie had no arc and the third act fell below zero on a level of interest.  

The intimacy was cheap and shallow. I feel it is an insult to homosexuals. A wet dream? Really? Are we really watching him roll cum around in his fingers? That is how you tell us he is sexually attracted to his friend? Grow the fuck up. If that were a white heterosexual couple and he rolled cum in his fingers because he came over a woman people would be outraged. 

It was just lifeless. It had so much potential in the beginning with the characters relationships but they fucked it up. It went nowhere. It was saved by good acting, decent cinematography (although many parts were overdone and made me dizzy distracting from what was happening), and really beautiful music. The music was the best part for me.  

When "Fences" was out there, this movie getting best picture was a travesty. The human experience in that was unreal and brought to life by unbelievable performances. It was dialogue driven and I understand that being tough for some. I didn't see Manchester but it must be better than this movie.   </TEXT>

That is funny, that was not my argument. Does this ever work for you?

Because it isn't that. At all.  

I am quite sure you are responding to the wrong person. 

I'm white, I acknowledge white privilege exists

<TEXT> No I don't. White privilege is the most divisive, racist, and devious term of our times. It is a broad brush of guilt that gives license to be racist and suffer zero consequences and ironically be praised for your righteousness. It is a fundamental misunderstanding of civil rights and what a privilege is.  


A civil right is guaranteed to everyone. Nobody is privileged with civil rights, we all get it. People who are good looking, free from genetic predispositions to disease, born into money, or born in a wealthy country have a privilege since it is not something we guarantee to everyone. Having said that, these people did nothing wrong and they owe nothing to others who did not get the same. They are not malicious and the others are not oppressed.
If a civil right is guaranteed to everyone, and some people have it taken away, the people who were not wronged, are not privileged. They did not receive a "a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group of people" because it is guaranteed to everyone.  


When that is taken away, the answer is to give it back, not find malice in people for not having their rights taken. Or shamelessly imply that they have some sort of original sin for the transgressions of multiple generations past. The playing field is not evened by committing the same atrocious acts as an act of retribution. That does not make you right, it makes you guilty. If something is ethically wrong, it is across the board. We fix the wrong, we don't perpetrate the same act as punishment on parties who lack guilt that share the same skin tone as past transgressors.  


You can be damn sure that someone is on the wrong side of the argument when they start screaming, not addressing your points, and calling you racist when there is zero evidence in your life for being so. I recommend you don't engage with people who use this term if there is the slightest bit of dishonesty, yelling, or derailment. There is nothing to gain. You will spend your time in a trap of telling them why you are not racist. You will never come out of that happy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whatever it takes to get them to help and that depends on the situation and the person. The big picture is that you are there for them. Knowing the science behind a brain disorder helped me with addiction and recovering from it. Your brain is just telling you things that you cannot will away. When you know what is going on, it is easier to identify it as some sort of outside influence you need to let pass. With anxiety especially, psychotherapy and better habits can retrain the brain.  Exercise is huge and takes time. People will not work for anything, try it for two weeks and then demand medication. Medication has it's place, but it's place is disgustingly over represented. It can also be used to facilitate change and be taken off of it. It is a chemical balancing act and that is why a doctor is important and finding the right one is even more important.  

I cannot emphasize exercise enough, intense cardio every day but probiotics are huge. Not the magic fix, but a piece of the puzzle. Look into research on them. There is stress tests done on rats that have staggering results. A quick google search can find those studies. THere is a good Radio Lab on one of them too. 

I have a high stress job and take "Garden of life: Mood" probiotics. When I am confronted with high stress, the edge is taken off without a doubt. If it is a placebo effect, I'm cool with that!!! Research suggests otherwise.  VSL #3 is way more concentrated but I don't feel the results as much. That being said, gut health is huge. 

It is complicated but attacking it from every angle is important and a therapist helps. Something as small as changing the decor in your house, the lighting, and keeping things clean can shave a level of stress off. Home is more welcoming instead of depressing.  

Shit, I am rambling. Good luck to any of you.  It seems to be quite an epidemic lately.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am brainwashed because I am critical of my own party? Fantastic then. 

Riots to prevent lectures, safe spaces, micro aggressions, 100 gender pronouns, fining people 250K for not using the correct of 100 gender pronouns, white privileged, calling all trump voters (many two time Obama voters) racists, calling everyone racist, bigots, islamophobes, homophobes, and now NAZIS!!!!!, halloween costumes, deplatforming speakers, openly advocating against free speech, punch a Nazi, and distorting facts on police violence to push a false narrative.  That is what I can ramble off the top of my head without stopping. 

That is rational? The left is irredeemable.  Nothing they do or stand for is for liberal principles. They need to call themselves something different. Real liberals need to reclaim the name "left" or re-brand themselves. What is happening is fucking disgusting. 

Criticizing the left is not an endorsement of the right.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Its not even close to sexual assault lmao

Substance from the start. 

worst thing the person did was mislead you he was a woman.  

Why did you bother to respond? That is assumed in the fucking question lol. Yes, that was bringing on sexual activity I did not want. 

And no, violence would definitely not be an appropriate response.  

But why? You just simply assert it. When is violence ever justified. I see sexual assault as having consequences where a physical retribution is not unreasonable if someone was knowing deceived into doing something sexual they did not want to do. I don't think I would be violent, but I am not sure I could fault someone for doing so. I definitely would press charges. 

Edit: Including "lmao" really added substance to your argument.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously this is in controversial. Spoiler alert. 

I got shit for suggesting that it only received the acclaim because it was about gay and black people. It had great acting, promise in the story that was not fulfilled, and some moments with cinematography. 

The gushing and overemotional reviews seemed to be about a different movie and it is the only reason I could come up with. The third act was stagnant, meaningless, disjointed, and lifeless. The concept of a gay black person in the ghetto was not profound enough to make up for the clunky assembly of the story. The intimacy moments were cheap and emotionless, I see them as an insult to the gay community. The camera work was beautiful at times but over the line in others. The introduction to Ali's character had a spinning camera technique that has been done before and was distracting, overdone, and had nothing to do with the scene. That is all I can remember off the top of my head.  There was no development of any character in the movie. It was a clunky mess. It was in incredibly flawed movie and had no business being best picture. I didn't even see Manchester but Fences was better acting, better story, more emotional, in depth view of the human experience, and better dialogue. On a different planet. I feel like I am taking crazy pills.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The facts are that millennials are in more debt, work longer hours for less reward and with less stability and less opportunities than baby boomers.

Found your problem. This is true for every generation. They just feel more like victims because it is happening when they are young.

But I'd be happy to introduce you to my friends who work every hour they can on zero hours contracts  

You mean the ones I acknowledged? It is almost like, dare I say it, you didn't read what I said? Nahhhh.

<TEXT> Yeah, sometimes we say what we have to, not because it is true. Fact is, he is trying to motivate a stagnant and weak generation who make excuses for wanting everything given to them and refusing to work for anything.  Granted, much of that is their parents fault, that doesn't absolve you of the responsibility for hardship and working your way up to things. This will be passed off as the age old "young people are lazy" but don't make that mistake. I have full confidence that the generation that follows this one will laugh at this one and look past it to find a seed to discover new things and find new ways to do things.  Trust me, it is not young people.  I feel sorry for the significant portion of this generation that don't look for excuses and doesn't want everything given to them and want to acknowledge them. I am sorry there is a stigma and you don't deserve it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because people want to be racist against you and find an out to absolve themselves of responsibility. You are being judged on your race and being chastised with a type of "original sin". If the people who are doing what is wrong, the racists, make themselves the victim and associate guilt to you by past aggression of people you have nothing to do with, the very act of objecting to even being called a racists is seen a racist. 

Oddly enough, and this is speculation, but I feel it is motivated less by racism and more by virtue signaling.  Only because it extends beyond race. The addiction to creating victims where they don't exist so you can see as the defender of the weak. It is also an addiction to creating malice in people where it doesn't exist. You do not have a victim if you don't fabricate people of ill-intent. 

White privilege is the most divisive, racist, and devious term of our times. It is a broad brush of guilt that gives license to be racist and suffer zero consequences and ironically be praised for your righteousness.  It is a fundamental misunderstanding of civil rights and what a privileged is.  

A civil right is guaranteed to everyone. Nobody is privileged with civil rights, we all get it. People who are good looking, free from genetic predispositions to disease, born into money, or born in a wealthy country have a privileged since it is not something we guarantee to everyone. Having said that, these people did nothing wrong and they owe nothing to others who did not get the same. They are not malicious and the others are not oppressed. 

If a civil right is guaranteed to everyone, and some people have it taken away, the people who were not wronged, are not privileged. They did not receive a "a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group of people" because it is guaranteed to everyone. 

When that is taken away, the answer is to give it back, not find malice in people for not having their rights taken. The playing field is not evened by committing the same atrocious acts as an act of retribution. If something is ethically wrong, it is across the board. We fix the wrong, we don't perpetrate the same act as punishment on parties who lack guilt that share the same skin tone as past transgressors.  

You can be damn sure that someone is on the wrong side of the argument when they start screaming, not addressing your points, and calling you racist when there is zero evidence in your life for being so. I recommend you don't engage with them and keep living your life.   </TEXT>

You seem to have a very deep misunderstanding of addiction. This comment is clear evidence. 

from withdrawal-induced rages  

There is so much ignorance in that (I am not calling you an ignorant person) I don't even know where to begin.  There are so many books I can recommend, but I think from what you are saying [this](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Overcoming-Addiction-Americas-Greatest/dp/0544112326/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1488281423 sr=8-2 keywords=clean) offers a good balance of science and anecdote.  If you want more, let me know.  

Edit: Oh no!  I had the wrong book in there.  I will switch the original linkas well. . [This](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Overcoming-Addiction-Americas-Greatest/dp/0544112326/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1488281423 sr=8-2 keywords=clean) is it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First and foremost, being black and gay in the ghetto wasn't profound enough to elevate the story to anything interesting and the third act was meandering and lifeless garbage. The actors in the first act were beautifully connected and it could have been something special, but it just wasn't and the story fell short. It fell short as a love story, it fell short in plot development, and it was disjointed and clunky. The intimacy was cheap and emotionless. 

The acting was great and it had real potential in the beginning. It could have been so many things, but it wasn't. I am 100% certain people are terrified to criticize it because they are scared to be called racists and bigots. This is the world we live in, groups went from marginalized to patronized.

This was bullshit, and still is bullshit, and needs to stop.  First of all, Trump could not define fascism (neither can most of you).  Second of all the narrative goes way farther than this. 

These people are not up for the task. They have meetings in the dark because they cannot find a light switch. They have national security briefings at a country club restaurant with people taking pictures on their cell phone. Read any of his tweets. He simply doesn't understand how the government works. Look at the people in his cabinet. Aside from Bannon, who is not a Nazi, they are hysterical buffoons.  He is a moron and demonstrates it every day. He is not a diabolical madman hellbent on topping a government to become a dictator. He is not up for the fucking challenge. 

If you don't like him stop with the Nazi babble. The Democratic party needs to win elections and you all sound like babbling morons selling pencils from a cup and wearing tinfoil hats. He is a moron. That is that. If you want him gone, stop doing the childish nonsense that turned voters away in the first place. Stop calling people racists, bigots, Nazi's, or whatever the flavor of the month is when you disagree with someone.

Just read that back to yourself. 

We should have borders as open as possible, being a melting pot is what made America great in the first place.  

It can still be a melting pot with secure borders and a reasonable system of immigration. They are not mutually exclusive. 

but they aren't committing a true crime simply by existing within the invisible lines that we've drawn on a map.

 Also, if a radical Christian group were to kill some people because those people had profaned the cross, should everybody rush to do dirty shit to the cross just to stick it to the murderous assholes? Or, should we remember that the cross means something to millions of non-murderous, less assholish people (no one is totally free of assholery) and maybe show some restraint?  

That is absolutely, and I think you know this, not the argument. Nothing can be gained by continuing.

<TEXT> We know why this is posted. All this nonsense just because people cannot be honest about anything. They cannot be honest about a single comment from a single lunatic. They, and this includes every major news outlet, never quote it accurately.  They cannot be honest that secure borders doesn't mean anti-immigration. They cannot be honest that Mexican immigration is net zero. They cannot be honest that drug trafficing AND decent people looking for a better life both happen. They cannot be honest that being an illegal immigrant is both illegal and we hold a big part of the responsibility because we never had a reasonable path to immigration.  

Nobody will say any bit of information if it doesn't fit their narrative. Your narrative should be the truth assholes.  Stop trying to outdo and demonize the other side. Whatever you care about, whatever you are passionate about, whatever your cause is, lying will never do it any good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a liberal, I am so disgusted with what is going on with the left I cannot help to think that this rise is their fault. Their constant insistence that everyone is a racist, a bigot, a Nazi, and an islamophobe. The almost demand we are overrun by bigots with ZERO evidence. Way too much on Trump and his administration are gross exaggerations and blatant baseless accusations and I hate Trump.  What we have been seeing is push back from this insanity. There is no way to tell either way and that is just my opinion.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am trying to get a decent video done for my students at school for a concert they did.  I video taped in 1080 and want to make a DVD and this is how I see it, I am here to be set straight.  

I have tried Mac and PC.  iMovie, Premier Pro.  I have .mts files at 1080 and the video is just shy of 30 min. I have tried all different types of burning and everything, even the graphics are not sharp at all.  I assume because DVD's only have a resolution 480i that is just the best it can do.  I can't be assured all the students have Blue-ray so, here is my question finally. 

If I film at a lower resolution will the quality be better because nothing has to be reduced to get on the DVD?  Or will it be unnoticeable and I will be in the same boat.    </TEXT>

I would like a software that can let me add chapters and maybe even a slide show.  It is for school events.  Thanks.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help! Senn HD280 - Sony 7506 I have problems with (in thread). Any recommendations? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-14 01:35:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Sonys' are piercing with the highs.  I cannot take it. With that comes some amazing clarity but it is too harsh.  The bass is quite loose and not tight.  


The HD 280's seem to have a hollow dead sound to them.  Very subtle though. Certain things I just hear this tin can sound. Not always.  I am nit picking. They are insanely tight. I could break them in but still worried they might be tight then I cannot return them.  

I just ordered the Audio Technica M50x.  I am not opposed to $175 for cans but I don't want to if I don't have to.  

Anyone break in the 280's decently well?

<TEXT> Without going into huge detail.  I prefer the SD280's for the tightness of the bass and overall sound but I cannot wear them.  They are so tight i have a headache after 20 min.  The 7506 are great but the highs are so prevalent that they are painful.  I have to turn the volume down so low to not feel pain it is too soft.  

Does Sennheiser make anything that will not crush your head?  Sony that will not make my ears bleed?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please help me understand peoples allegiance to Kanye.

Everyone's defense of him is an argument from authority. That authority being what the public buys and the ratings that are driven by it. Public opinion is NO representation of skill His rhythms are mind-numbingly simplistic, everything he does is exhaustively repetitious, and his rapping has no concept of time. He is sometimes ahead of the beat and sometimes behind the beat. His lyrics have pathetic displays of literary devices and content of the gutter level of human experience.  The form of his songs are nothing new, the sounds are all rehashed.  They are also exhaustively repetitious.  He creates nothing. He just puts together things that already exist and markets them well. Now the big thing is that he puts heavy metal with his music? Black Skinhead is just rehashed music with the only thing he knows how to do, rap. As stated before I think he does that terribly. "Public Enemy" did the same thing with "Anthrax", it is nothing revolutionary. The only art that was done is the people he hired to do the set on his recent SNL performance. He cannot create any of this. Does he even play an instrument? What the fuck is wrong with you people? It is just his relentless and adamant bombardment of self praise comparing himself to Jesus and Shakespeare that have people all so insanely brainwashed.  

I understand people liking him, that is fine, but why does the public pretend there is something that is being done that is revolutionary or skilled. I saw people arguing over how he is like Beethoven.  I couldn't even....

What am I missing?  If all you have is that he sells records don't bother.   </TEXT>

He is very old school and is open to using it but "only if the Dr. says it is OK."  His desire to be comfortable seems to be over riding the taboo he has for the drug.  Any first hand experience I can use to help convince him? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had two clowns eaten by my anemone, after talking to a lot of people (many here) we figured they had to die before he ate them.  I bought one more and a damselfish.  They were doing great and all my levels were perfect!  Then one night they are having the time of their lives and the next morning upside down and dying.  

Long story short I found I was getting shocked on a small cut on my hand.  The culprit was a crimped wire on the heater.  I replaced it and no shock.  Can that kill my fish?  There is no current flow is there?  Like a bird on a wire?  Maybe I completed the flow when my hand went in?  Anyone ever hear of this happening?  It CAN"T be anything else but scared to buy fish.  Tested my water again everything is great.   </TEXT>

They also cut to so many different angles so quickly you can't tell what is going on.  Does anyone know if they also slow down the film speed?  Why do they do this! They work so hard finding special forces experts to choreograph the fights and they are all wasted with shaky cameras and fluctuating camera angles.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This is the second article](http://www.salon.com/2013/09/11/richard_dawkins_doesnt_get_to_define_sex_abuse/) I saw on Dawkins being completely misrepresented, only this one is worse because it even contains more quotes clarifying what he meant, yet still rants off on a tangent misrepresenting his words.  By offering an account of how he feels about his own event he is accused of  proclaiming that "human reactions ought to be predictable and similar" and is sarcastically branded as "the Officially Designated Spokesperson for the Human Race". Is this manufactured outrage?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most human beings have a natural instinct that we evolved with called altruism.  When we see someone in pain, heartache or sadness, our instincts will usually reward us with a euphoric sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when we offer our guidance or support. Sadly, the people who are in despair are left vulnerable to the thought of any possible relief to quell the relentless and churning pain in their chest.


 If someone were to take advantage of this vulnerability it would make them a shameless predator with no regard for human well being.  The only difference between a predator in the wild and a detestable person such as this is that the predator seeks nutritional sustenance and the charlatan seeks sustenance in the form of thievery and deceit.  What kind of vile person could not only justify such behavior, but also be hungry for it?  Look no further.


To participate in what you do and have the nerve to proclaim your actions as benevolent, demonstrates the highest level of arrogance and reveals you as the type of person who salivates while your diseased mouth sinks its teeth into dishonesty and deceit.  To be able to be successful at what you do your actions have to be practiced and polished with the intent to mislead people.  You are a master of making the ordinary seem unordinary, you make the clear unclear, and you make the natural seem supernatural.  This is a skill you have to knowingly work on in order to take advantage of people at some of the most distraught times of their life.  You are so good at your dishonestly you get people to pay for it. 
I know some may like to blame the people for being gullible and hopeful and I am sure that is how you justify it to yourself as you shamelessly and easily fall into a deep sleep after a long day of stealing from people.  You are no different than scam artists that steal from the elderly.  They take advantage of a brain that is handicapped by senility and you take advantage of a brain that is handicapped with despair. 


I hope every time you spend a single dime you think about who you took it from and what lies you had to tell to get it. These people can be helped with honesty and love and you offer nothing to them other than trickery and lies.  I wish there was something I could say to make you feel as nauseous as I do when I read your website.  I wish there was something I could say to make you care about the people you steal from.  But my words are typed in vain because you are just inherently a bad person.  To look you in your eyes one must be met with a cold and heartless gaze from a woman who emits a foul stench of repugnance.

<TEXT> I stand before you as the "Bad Mother Fucker" my reputation has branded me as to give you a message that you must heed, or you will all face consequences of catastrophic proportions. These words need to be fed to your young as the antidote to the iniquitous infection that is invading the consciousness of our species. There is a storm a comin mothafuckers, and you better open your eyes to the horizon, because your ignorance will not protect you from its onslaught. It will destroy every last one of you leaving a path of destruction that cannot be viewed by the eyes of the extinct, but rest assured, you will suffer the agony of the extinction. Your destroyer has a name, it is reality motherfuckers. Wake the fuck up, shut the fuck up, and stand the fuck up and respect the most righteous motherfucker you will ever fathom. For if too many dare to cloud the vision of reality with the venom of ignorance then reality will sink its teeth into our existence and swallow the entire lot of us into a pool of vengeful digestive acids of fate. Respect it, discover it, and hunger for it. You have an obligation and the privilege of devoting every ounce of your being to uncovering the hidden elegance that reality is humbly waiting to expose to every last one of us. For it is THE Bad Mother Fucker. </TEXT>
