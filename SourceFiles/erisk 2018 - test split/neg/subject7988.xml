<TEXT> Myshkin isn't arrested at the end and Nastassya doesn't die because of him. Interesting point though tying in the title to the theme! My edition says about Myshkin, "in him, his creator, Dostoyevsky, sees Russia's redemption." So I read the book that society thought of Myshkin as the idiot but he is actually what society should strive to be (even though he just seemed like a normal guy) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very good points and thank you for bringing them up! I thought mostly about Myshkin but Nastassya does seem to be the more interesting character now that you mention it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just finished The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky and it did not quite resonate like I'd hoped! </TITLE>

<TEXT> The Brothers Karamazov is tied for my favorite book of all time (with East of Eden) so I was excited to finally delve into more Dostoyevsky. The Idiot seemed intriguing so I read through it and once again Dostoyevsky was wonderful prose and thought provoking sections. I believe his theme is that Prince Myshkin is the epitome of a human being and character but cannot survive or change the debased society we exist in. He enters it knowing nothing and leaves it in shambles.

My only complaint is that I never really got the sense that Myshkin was anything more than just a normal guy living in a rich social group. He doesn't do anything exceptional or even out of the ordinary. He just had common human deceny and respects others and I'm from the Midwest so that's just the average person. Any thoughts or more perspectives to help me see more into this book? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "true terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country". Any quote from any novel of any genre will work! I'm just looking for a relevant one to starting real life with all my friends and achieving the dreams we had of since we were all little. It is also crazy that these people I have seen do incredibly stupid things are now in important positions so that's why I choose my quote. Mainly trying to avoid "life laugh love" and the other trite quotes you hear all the time! Also what novel it is from wouls be nice to know. Thank you in advance for any of your suggestions! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is true but it seems a lot of Tesla investors don't think other companies are competing and beating Tesla at their own game. For example, Ford has sold 560,000 electric cars since it began making them in 2005. Tesla has sold 186,000 electric cars since it started in 2008. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll start by comparing profits: 881671 for 2014 and 923503 in 2015 an increase of 4.7%. Next sga: 603660 for 2014 (68% of profits) and 932232 (99.9% of profits, looks like Musk and stagg is loving your investments) for 2015 an increase of 52.8%. Ouch. Net income: -294040 for 2014 and -888663 for 2015 an increase in losses of 202.2%. We will see what end of the year 2016 brings. But the numbers make it very obvious that tesla rides on hype, not performance. Hopefully all goes well for the tesla investors though, I wish the best of luck! </TEXT>
