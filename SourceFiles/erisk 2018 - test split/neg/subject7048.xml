<TEXT> I've been thinking about it, but to be honest there's not sufficient "horror" elements that could define this story as a Dark Fantasy. When I use this term, I tend to think about Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" or even Guillermo's "Pan's Labyrinth", and they have completely different atmospheres than my setting.

<TEXT> I assume time paradox is wrong, because the narrative runs from people perspective, and not from the Androids.
It's only to tell about this society the protagonist lives in, so you can leave time and space travel off from this one. 

Guess sci-fi or dystopian fiction are the best definition.
Just in the middle between these two. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read about speculative fiction a bit, seems fitting. But it's way too vast to define a genre. If we follow the structure, it would point out to sci-fi, although as i said, it recalls to a world way too evolved for this story. 
Dystopian fiction seems right, to be honest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nosomn, you're completely right! 

To begin with, the androids are what they are, and not upgraded humans (as you can see, for example, in Ghost in the Shell) and they come from a different universe. People in the city don't know about their existence, but the androids do, because they are all experiments of a project with the objective of creating the ideal human race. 

I thought about that twist in the process of plot outline, believe it or not. But then the movie "Pan's Labyrinth" came to my head at the exact moment, and I think it would be way too similar to it. I really wanted to write something as innovative as possible, and the "is it real or not" subject in these kind of stories is getting worn out. I mean, the tragic ending is already there for this one, waiting to be written. 

So, would sci-fi describe it? Usually the term recalls to a world so much more evolved. Feel it doesn't fit anywhere! Damn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not factual, and there's not much elements of fantasy, besides the androids. 

It's like a mature approach to fantasy storytelling, blending antique society with a bit of futuristic stuff. 

Can't see which of the "punk's" subgenres would fit here aswell.

<TITLE> What genre would this book be classified as? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 20:51:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's a story that unfolds in a persian-teocratic society which lives secluded in a desert, with huge architecture and buildings, but also smaller residences in outskirts where the protagonist lives in. People dress with mesopotamic clothing and soldiers wield scimitars. It is ruled by a very corrupted fraternity of priests with a gloomy secret, and the city is visited by a pair of strange androids that are searching for something. 

The thematic talks about about belief, politics and corruption in an adventure-oriented style, and inevitably the conflict of two societies with different knowledges.   
How could I define this book genre?

About the song structure, I believe it's fine, but you shouldn't be afraid of adding some new sounds, and I found out that the main lead is particularly annyoing, at least for me. The melody is fine, the sound design that just didn't buy for me. 
But don't worry, the other instruments are pretty cool and interesting.  </TEXT>

I think I'm trying to mix thinking about the loudness and high frequencies are related to perception. Maybe I should only think about the loudness thing when I get to the mastering part. 

And sorry about that! Will def take a look there to see if I can get any help.

<TEXT> Sorry, but even belonging to the same franchise, those are two different types of games, with different proposals. While RE4 is more action-oriented, RE7 is all about horror and frailty (at least in the first half, before character growth), so you ARE supposed to be playing with an ordinary guy, and I feel like his lack of combat skills is intentional.
I wouldn't accept seeing Ethan performing combat skills and being like "Heel yea, that fits to the game", because it clearly would not.
Remember that Leon received training to become an agent from the government, so his action set makes sense. 
 
Of course, they could have refined overall defense mechanics in RE7 because it's understandable to complain about being able to almost deny an axe swing by just raising your arms. That is complete bullshit. 

PS: Leon's abilities were completely exploitable in terms of combat system, every enemy would just stop/miss attacks even though they hit, just so you could perform the action. That shit is even more nonsense.

You've got a point at the linear level design from Lucas Testing Area. I could see myself going back to those places in search of items, antique coins and Mr.Everywhere though. 
Could you please explain me about your thoughts on the combat system? How could it be better? It runs smooth as hell for me.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was the first time that I got legit scared and felt an unnerving tension to keep up since Dead Space. I've beaten a good bunch of horror games and I must say that RE7 is currently the winning title for me, it takes the survival-horror genre into its core. 


I've loved every part of it. 
The Mansion had the perfect pace and right amount of backtracking, really taking us to a "RE1" kind of trip. Jack is also arguably the best character in the game.  

I really liked the Old House level design too and Marguerite boss battle was creepy as hell. The tension was well-built for that particular character.

The test field or whatever it's called was a bit linear but it made sense for me. The VHS exploit to get rid of Lucas trap was beautiful. 

The ship was awesome too. It sorta had a different vibe and atmosphere; feeling defenseless again and having to grab all the stuff made the second half really good. 

The mine was a let down, but understandable. Just wish it wasn't that linear and the final boss fight actually needed some mechanics. 

Would give a 8.8/10. Would need to play on Madhouse to be sure though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has anyone thought about how will Jon prove his parentage though? Would anyone actually believe in the word of the time-traveller Bran, the (seemingly) only one who knows about his past? 

Wielding the "Targaryen" surname can reasonably give any man power: the right for the Iron Throne and a good bunch of supporting people (the dornishmen, for example, apparently are still willing to do so, as many others); so questioning the veracity of it would be primary right? Otherwise anyone would allege to be from the House. 

The only way to prove it would have to be putting Jon to a test. Or maybe one of Daenerys dragons will get attached to him implying that he's from the same bloodline.

<TEXT> It's a wild Forest, the path shouldn't be tidy for a survivor. 
I believe that if we had more interactions with the survival guide besides being a self-protection oriented structure crafting, it would give much more context and realism to the game. 

Like, imagine yourself in a cave, and you need to climb to a higher section, but you don't have a wall for the climbing axe, so the only way to progress would be constructing structures that could take your character up there. 
Or maybe a broken bridge above the abyss, an 90 degrees steep moutain, ...I think you get what I mean.
Adding depth to the crafting tools would give the players more options and versatility, and therefore make the exploration even more fun than it already is.

<TEXT> The best fix would be to switch his W with his R really, make the Abyssal Voyage CD around 20 and with decreased range in the first levels; make the Devour an ult with around 50 seconds of wait time, but with a small buff: now he gets movespeed while devouring both enemy and ally champions.

That way he wouldn't be able to spam the ability of saving his teammates all the time and in laning phase there would be more chances of the enemy bot to kill your AD pre-6.

<TITLE> Reporting some Tahm Kench weird bugs (Pre-Season Patch) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-21 16:25:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday I played only one game with him after the pre-season launch and found out 2 bugs already, and one of them has happened twice with me in the last 2 patches. 


1 - I couldn't cast my W (Devour) on my teammate Yi for the entire game. If it weren't by the bug, I would have saved him from death SO many times. (Almost 100% sure this bug was reported in reddit before) (I think it has to do with the meditate interaction, but not sure if it can happen with other champions though)


2 - Sometimes when I cast the Devour on enemy champions, they could still use skills or autoattacks inside of me. 
Ex: I used it on enemy Caitlyn and after ~0.5 seconds she used her Piltover Peacemaker inside of me and got out, even before I could spit her.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I was playing a competitive match and I noticed after the first round that a lot of things were not behaving right. 

1 - Smoke bombs were not appearing after being launched to the ground, and I could see everything behind it. That was the most gamebreaking bug. 

2 - Music in the game gone. 

3 - Couldn't see who killed who, only the money being cashed in.

4 - At the end of every round, nothing showed up, it just moved to the next round.

And I lost that game, mainly because the screen froze after round ~6 and I had to relaunch the game, losing two full rounds. 
I've never seen anything like that before and I don't know if it's a common issue, and also can't quite tell what caused it. Just felt the necessity of sending here for you guys.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello guys, I've bought cs:go this week and started playing because of my friends, I'm currently lv2. I was having a lot of fun with the game and doing pretty well, until today. 

In the middle of a match, my team decided to kick me just because I wasn't doing well (my lv compared to the enemy team was really low). I clearly remember one of them saying: "Goodbye, trash" just before I got to the lobby. I closed the game immediately, feeling a bit guilty and worried. That really got me, and now I'm rethinking about keeping on with this game. Don't wanna be the crybaby, but how many times will I have to face this situation again, since this was just my third day playing? Those guys who kicked me were mostly veterans, and it's sad to see them using this kind of attitude with newcomers. Haven't the game teached them anything at all? Were they that good when they started playing?

Just a thing I wanted to say. You can take this post either seriously or just ignore, but thanks anyways.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Draft just takes so much time, and plus the loading screen, it's about 5-7 minutes. Taking about 2 minutes to find a game, it's almost 9 minutes that I have to wait for every match to start.
People normally wouldn't complain since we are faced with this system for 5 years now, but thinking out of the box, that would save so much time of our lives and we would get to play wayy more games in a single day.
Riot said they were focusing on an enchanced draft screen, so I really hope they are considering a fast paced draft.

And that's why I actually agree with Garen changes. Having him to chase after a villan makes so much sense. But then, you give Darius healing over his spinning axe and Fiora over her ult, and also Mordekaiser not sharing experience, it just doesn't stick because it doesn't fit with the characters, and by doing so you are basically ignoring all process of building that was made for each of them in their pasts.    </TEXT>

Well thank you guys anyways.

<TEXT> After the investment over the Cblol (our LCS) finals at Allianz Park Stadium which supported a crowd of around 15.000 plus the 500k viewers from all country (twitch, youtube, movie theaters), the game is being talked all over the place; from television to radio, and it's really awesome to be a part of all that.             
Congratulations Riot!

EDIT: Guys, it's about support growth, I'm not saying that Brazil is now stronger then other regions (even though + support equals to a stronger cenario over time).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's not a very popular champion and, even though his winrates are around 49~51%, it feels really unrewarding to play with him. His kit is ok, but it's pretty weak compared to other champions right now. 

You want sustain? Get vlad. You want to all in the other team and kill everyone? Riven and Irelia are there. You want to get extremely tanky and be the front line and still manage to survive the most bloody fights? Renekton and Ryze says hi.

It's about time we've seen Aatrox being played in queue (or even in normal games) and I really believe that he deserves some tweaks such as the upcoming ones with GP.

<TITLE> After the last patch, the icons of the active items are extremely confusing! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-28 21:27:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before this last patch, people could just glance the inventory to see if their items were ready to use, but right now, we often see ourselves trying to use the active items even though they won't work. Why? 

Riot changed the way these items are being displayed (or maybe just a bug?). Now when they are in cooldown, it's almost impossible to just glance and know if they are ready, simply because they keep bright when in cooldown, and this causes a lot of gamechanging mistakes, unfortunately. 

I know there is a new HUD coming out, but that doesn't mean we should ignore this.

<TEXT> What is the problem of having a full target-ability champion?
If everyone is provided with skillshots the game will lose diversity and will look like a firework's rift.
I feel that Riot is always trying to make different champion concepts, lore and gameplay but in the actual game they all feel the same. 
Let's look at Lee Sin and see why he's so fun to play:

- He's not "cc and kill confirmed" type of champerino. 

- Versatile, skills have different uses

- Mechanically unique

They should innovate in terms of mechanics for the next releases or try different kinds of cc's. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't think many people realized that the video about Ekko fighting with "Urgot" can tell us more about the champion itself then we thought. 
Notice how Riot wants to let it clear that, even when going back in time, Ekko still keeps damaged. If you see in the video, he takes a stomp on his arm, and when activating the time mechanism, he still hold his left arm feeling the pain.

So technically in the Rift, the ability of going back a few seconds will probably take you to the last spot you where, but your health will keep the same if you take damage from anything.

<TEXT> Maybe a champion that would be able to have an gravity field around him that would slow your enemies depending on the weight/tankiness of their items. And by slowing I mean reducing drastically movement speed, attack speed so he would be tough against bruisers. 
Since he's a gravity based champion, his skills could work with %hp and get better while he builds ap.

<TEXT> Well they don't actually NEED to start ulting from that far. 
Let's have an example:
The enemy team is doing dragon and you are blued side. Sion and Bard already have the strategy to make the play, so Sion ults and Bard throw his E at the wall, making a surprise engage and maybe even stealing the dragon itself. The rest of his team could either follow the engage by the Magical Journey or flank by the river while all happens.
Just imagine the possibilities. :) </TEXT>

No, WE have to thank you. Certainly one of the biggest artists of EM out there that deserves WAY more attention. 
I really want to know what to throw at the master bus! I generally come up with 2 Maximus, one for the Comp and the other for the Gain and some EQ.
If you want to hear how you inspired me, please visit my soundcloud (Tulio Ricci) if it's not asking much. It would be a dream.
Getting at Born Records is my motivation!!

3. What inspires you to write your songs? 

4. Do you plan making tours in other countries in the future?

5. Any tips for a good mastering?

6. Do you believe you can grow your audience with your own music style to most of the Spinning Records artists in terms of popularity?

7. What was the biggest challenge for the Living Color EP?
