<TEXT> That's why celebrities often go "wonky" especially if they started young. Perhaps that's the reason why mental disorders are hitting new highs as people are constantly viewing themselves this way thanks to modern social media culture. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Million Dollar Movie Idea (bold title that promises to deliver) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 05:02:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Takes place in a community from the future. Not futuristic but in terms of timing/ foreshadowing. Similar to "The Hunger Games"  or "Divergent". It is a society that lives by a set of governing rules that ensure what happened in the past doesn't happen again. The "Present" society is a very modernized, advanced version of the first, primitive times of humans like tribes for example. The movie plot involves a young group of kids challenging the views and wanting to privatize human needs like water, food, etc. they learn lessons throughout their greed journey that cite the "barbaric" times when those were the exact things that put humanity at risk of extinction.... then some trippy shit happens and people watching it *gasp* in awe. 

Sorry, pretty high. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Flat out being 17 sucks! I remember I had never felt more stress in my life then 17-18. I didn't get it, they teach you so much random stuff in school but never teach you how to manage yourself. I'd say do something you can invest time into. Maybe something you and your mom can do together. I'm not sure how I got over my mind at that age I just know I didn't feel "calm" for about a year. Try your best not to overthink too, I know it's hard but that was my worst enemy going through stress/ confusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright so I had this long thing typed out but I realized it wasn't capturing the main point haha so here is the main point. I want to eat healthy but I always cave. I will go 5 days eating really amazing good foods then go 7 days eating absolutely terrible (like a whole box of brownies and whole pizza to myself in a night type of thing). Of course I always feel so terrible about myself when I eat bad and I feel so amazing and confident when I eat good. I want to stop doing this up/down thing. I need to find a way to control myself. It feels like I need to be chewing like I need to be eating even if I am so close to puking because of how much I have eaten. No matter what I still have the urge to eat. I need help controlling myself and I need help staying on a consistent diet. Please guys any advice helps, it's starting to really impact my mental health and I'm getting somewhere I've never been before. That's why I decided I can't do this alone anymore, I need help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of really good points already mentioned. I agree just make sure you are in a good environment, you don't want to enhance your issues and have a plan for when you finally get high especially it being your first time. Coloring high is a personal go to if you want, it's very relaxing and fun!  </TEXT>
