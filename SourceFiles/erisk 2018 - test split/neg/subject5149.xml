<TEXT> Yeah I wouldnt have it based off the movies. 
Neither would I want him to look like Hugh Jackman. 

I was thinkin more comics based, with the classic villains. And definitely a younger Logan so the claws and healing factor would still be intact. 

As for the rights, if Arkham games could get rights to so many characters, why won't this game be able to pull that off?

<TEXT> If any studio works on a game based on Logan, and develop it upto the caliber of Batman's Arkham games, then it would be huge. 

Plus, like how in most games the characters heal after some time (eg. Uncharted), that same logic can be applied in the Logan game and fans will happily digest that because Wolvo heals. 

A studio should definitely work on this. Can someone from Rocksteady pick this up? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been out of the gaming business for a long time, just recently put my foot into it. My last three games that I have completed and really enjoyed playing are The Last of Us, Uncharted 4 and GTA V. 

Currently playing Arkham Knight but it's not giving the feels of the above mentioned games. 

I was thinking of looking forward to either Watchdogs 2(didnt play Watchdogs) or The Division. But the reviews arent like what TLOU received.

Which game would be better in your opinion? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remember Messis iconic celebration after the PSG game? (6-1)

Remember Iniestas celebration against Chelsea in 2009? 

See now you wouldn't want us to call you cunts for celebrating a victory when the opponents were clearly robbed right?

And I am done telling it to the people who rely on media but I'll tell it once again. That Bayern game was disastrous refereeing. In the first leg they received a penalty for chesting a ball. In the second leg, multiple times it was supposed to be a corner kick (something RM is real good at) but was given a goal kick. That own goal by Ramos was also supposed to be caught offside. 

I would mention the faults the ref made to favor RM but seems like you know that already. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although this data is beautiful, Alexa has become a lot less reliable. They collect information by two methods. 

1. I as a website owner have to buy their subscription and they provide me with a tracking code so the visitors and page views on my site get counted. 

2. I as a user can install their plugin that would automatically send them data about what sites I visit. 

The miscalculations arise when I don't have a plugin installed and I am visiting a site that did not subscribe to them. These visits will not get counted at all. I am pretty sure all the top 100, even top 1000 sites, all of them have subscribed to Alexa. </TEXT>

In favor of Real: 
2nd leg: 
Casemiro survived a second Yellow. 
Ronaldo's 2nd goal.
Ronaldo's 3rd goal.

In favor of Bayern: 
1st leg:
Wrongly called Penalty. 
2nd leg: 
Vidal should have been sent off earlier.
Offside 2nd goal. 

Refereeing sucked but I bet it evens out the wrong calls. Real Madrid will go through without any guilt.

<TEXT> I think the points are calculated like this. 

The score at that time is kept in mind. Messis first goal is +2 points as the score is 0-0 and Barcelona would have got one point out of it. Messis 2nd goal was worth 0 points as they were already winning. 

What bothers me is how the points are assigned to the player who is making a come back. Like the player who scored Sociedads 1st goal, did not bring any points to them but it sure as hell was worth something as it could have provided a path to a comeback. Similarly Paco Alcacers goal was worth no points. 

The only worthy goal in this match goes to Messi because of his 1st goal. 

In the case of Real Madrid vs Gijon, the first player to score in the match for Gijon was worth 2 points. Iscos first goal was worth 1 point. Second Gijon player also gets two points. Morata gets 1 point for equalizer and Isco gets two more for the winner. 

In this case, Iscos goals were worth 3 points, Moratas goals were worth 1 point. 
Gijons points dont get calculated as they lost the match.

<TEXT> That is true. Forcing someone to do something, even if it is good for them doesn't work. Instead you set up an example.

You want to make your SO stop drinking sodas? You stop drinking sodas but make sure you ask them whether they want it on your next trip to the groceries. Like this they wont feel that soda is forbidden, just that its bad for the health because their SO (you) are avoiding it.

LPT: To make your SO diet, just mention out loud the amount of calories and sugar in each food item.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's been 7 months since the last =3 video came out. Now with the popularity of RWJ in 2014, it looks apparent that reviewing viral videos should have become a thing. But instead the content creators of YouTube have moved to vlogging their life, creating reaction videos, performing social experiments etc. 

Why isn't anyone reviewing viral videos? Because new videos don't stop being viral.

<TEXT> Very apt post. I don't buy phones that often. Here are my phones in chronological order.
HP iPAQ
Nokia C6
iPhone 5
Galaxy Note 4

The first two were complete disasters. iPhone 5 was a great phone. 
Note 4 was great at first.

As a user who uses the phone for a long long time, I can say this for sure, when the devices are new, the performance is even on both the devices. But after an year of usage, Android really starts deteriorating. 

A couple of days back my Note 4 was damaged so while it was getting fixed I used a spare iPhone 4s ( in 2016 ). Believe me when I say, the performance of 4s was at par with the Note 4. Snapchat performed better. And sleeping with 100% charge, I found it to be in the 90s itself. There have been days that I slept with 60% on the Note 4 and woke up to it being switched off. 

I like the Note 4 in some aspects like the ease of transferring music, pictures and of course, Truecaller. It's a pain to use truecaller on the iPhone. I still use the EarPods on my Note 4 so that's a plus for iPhone. 

Overall verdict - I can't wait to get back into the Apple ecosystem. The next iPhone ( 7s or 8 ) would be my next phone unless the Google Pixel is really kicking the ball out of the park.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many examples of tag clouds without the different font-sizes, with/without number of posts badge etc. 

Also, in the post page if a reader drifts off mid way through the article, there are no links for him to stay on the site. Most websites who worry too much about the bounce rate have a sidebar to aid the distracted readers. And direct links to the blogpost may also increase the bounce rates. According to http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/technobyte.org/ , your bounce rate is 25% which is not too bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This guy in school once lied something about me to a girl we both really liked. She was mad at me and didn't talk to me for two whole years. 

After those two years we got together again I liked her even more now and that other guy was already blocked from all her accounts. I requested her to let me have fun with him pretending to be her and boy I did. 
I made him crazy for me. He used to go up to the roof to show me a view of his city at 5 am. He literally clicked pictures of all his childhood pics because I told him he was cute. I made him agree to things he never did. 
And when he finally said he wants to marry me, I blocked him again.
Good times.

When you start earning you need to accept the amount you are earning. There will be friends who earn more than you and when you hangout with them you will be tempted into purchasing something you cant afford. You have to control that temptation. 

Then there will be times when you hangout with friends who dont earn as much. You can take them to a not so fancy restaurant and offer to pay their part of the bill too.

<TEXT> My little brother was a rage monster. We were playing Tekken 3 I think on the ps2. While I had gone to the washroom, he set my health to 0% and one punch would have knocked me out. We fought and he still couldn't beat me. So he took the joystick and beat me in real life. Broke my nose, yeah.

Point is, in a high profile game, form doesn't matter. Man City were in top 4 in CL last season. A position barca couldnt make to. Psychologically speaking, they should have had the upper hand. But like it was said, after Messis goal, they did fuck up.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was never a fan of Pep but he did invent beautiful football with Barcelona. With Manchester City it looks like he is doing a career suicide. His tactics suck. 3 of the goals in the clash against Barcelona were defence errors. And he said in the conference to win against Barcelona you have to score more than them. Then he benches his best striker. Is he the new Moyes? Or did the Camp Nou reception make him emotional and he planned to not win this match? Something doesnt look right, this looks like Rafael Van Moyes under Peps skin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Messi is a great footballer. Maybe even the best. The way he penetrates the defence is something only a few can do. Quick tiki taka helps him too. This is because of years of practice since the Ronaldinho days. He doesnt have much experience without players who can do the tiki taka with him. So as much as Barcelona depends on Messi, even Messi depends on Barcelona. Being the best player and not winning the Copa America, is a joke. Argentina is a star studded team. And its not Europe!

Ronaldo on the other hand can make the most of finishing. He is great with headers so even if a midfielder crosses the ball in the box then it is upto Ronaldo to finish it. Looking for open positions in the box, being there at the right time is what Ronaldo does. And he doesnt miss 80 percent of the time when he gets the perfect ball. 

So my verdict. Messi's BarcelonaRonaldo's Real Madrid but
RonaldoMessi. </TEXT>

This is the code I am using to hide the subscribe form popup. Problem is that it displays every time the page loads or the user navigates to a different URL. I want a button on the same form that would act like "Don't show again" and that would make the form disappear for the person.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I do understand the wordpress queries and php syntax. I built the entire website on my own, so I have some knowledge in reading others code. The hierarchy we use in our theme is like this. Single.php : The loop starts and ends here. Inside the loop there's an if condition that gets the post layout, either content-single.php or content-single-2.php. The second post layout, ie content-single-2.php is what I want to be in infinite scroll. It will be implemented only for a certain categories.
