Next day added another sachet of yeast, more flour and water until I could ply the dough (probably 300g flour) and salt.

Knead till super stretchy, proof an hour, make in to bagel shapes, proof again for half an hour, boil two minutes in water with dark brown sugar then bake at 220c for 20mins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> British yup, we call it strong white flour but you can also find bread flour which is the same thing I'm sure.

Also I realise now that it sounded like I did the second proofing in the oven. I proofed the dough after rolling in to shape OUTSIDE of the oven - which I was heating up to 230 degrees Celsius and put a tray of water at the bottom (hence steaming it).

I didn't use a pooling, could that make the holes bigger? It was still crunchy of the out and fluffy on the inside so I'm happy with it taste wise, just want it more aesthetically accurate so thanks for your help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used a strong white flour and an instant yeast sachet. I mixed until it pulled away from the bowl then let it proof till doubled in size.

Then folded, placed in the tray and let it proof for an hour whilst steaming the oven. Baked at 230c for about 25 minutes.

I'd love to have larger holes in the bread at the end. The dough was very sticky when I was working with it. Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear, it sounds like you are struggling at the moment.

The most important thing is to speak to your primary care physician about how you are. Make sure you tell him about your suicidal ideation also.

Hopefully he can refer you for psychological input. In the UK (England) this would be IAPT, otherwise I'm not sure what it would be in the states.

Best of luck with it </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do it if you need it.

People ideally need to stop thinking about it as taboo and more like something they simply need some support with.

Sometimes we get ill and can get over it our selves, sometimes we need to ask for loved ones and friends advice. Other times we need professional help just like when we need to see our doctors for professional help.

Help comes in the form of medication or talking therapies generally depending on where you are. My advice is if you think you need help go for an assessment/consultation somewhere. It doesn't mean you need to engage in full treatment but can help answer any questions you might have and to see if it is for you.

<TEXT> I was 22, she was 30. I was a little chubby and she was slim, blonde, polish and 6 foot. Met at work and immediately as rely assumed she was waaaaay out of my league so I just stated being myself around her. It worked!

It started out great, she thought I was a carefree guy she can be herself with, I thought she was more mature than the usual 20 year old girl I was getting sick of.

I was right, she was wrong. Clich of a relationship of course but she became clingy, jealous and very possessive. Sex wasn't great either even though she was physically stunning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trauma and phobias are two different things, but both are debilitating in that they can result in severe avoidance of instances. Simply put:

Phobia is an irrational fear of something, usually developed over time by avoiding the feared thing. Avoidance makes the fear stronger, and treats it like it is as irrationally dangerous as you think. Doing so means it will usually seep in to other avenues of your life due to stimulus similarity - e.g. arachnophobia can lead over time to a fear of spindly legs etc.


Trauma is different, its a normal human response to an abnormal situation. It can result in flashbacks and severe avoidance of anything that evokes emotion similar to the traumatic incident. Over time the avoidance can again result in leaking effects on to other things - e.g. not going out at night after being mugged, becomes not going out during day either over time.

<TEXT> A simple explanation would be that normal sugar increasing in intake would result in an increase of insulin - leading to no longer feeling hungry.

Fructose doesn't cause the same reaction in insulin in the body, and is converted more readily in to fat (triglycerides). So not only do you not get the reduced hunger as you consume more, it is more easily store as fat in the body.

Bad times.
