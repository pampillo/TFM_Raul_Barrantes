<TEXT> Slightly off topic but in my neighbourhood, someone did graffiti on Jamie Lee Ross' billboard thing. It said "I like to eat dick quacks" in a speech bubble. Few months later John Key comes to talk to my school about himself with Jamie Lee Ross by his side and he did a Q A at the end. My mate got up and asked "Do you agree that Jamie Lee Ross does in fact eat duck quacks?" His answer was that he definitely agrees. My mate got a warning from the principal shortly after the assembly. </TEXT>

EDIT: Just remembered a story that may seem relevant but irrelevant. Basically when Red Cross came to my high school for blood donations, some students got high before donating blood in hopes that whoever receives their blood would get high too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YES! This is a big thing that I hate. Today I had the happiest lunch ever. I'm doing this program at a university that is similar to summer school but for students who are only just getting into uni. The program only just started so nobody knows anybody at the moment. During lunch people started playing music on the speakers on the classroom and everybody was listening and later on other people wanted to play their own music. Everybody had their own genres and artist that they listened to and what really surprised me was that nobody judged their taste. Instead they talked about hows its really different and how they like it. we had stuff ranging from Japanese heavy metal to Alt-j to rap.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really a "he's right behind me" moment but I was riding the bus to school one day and I had my mate sitting next to me and it was a pretty awkward and quiet ride. We went past a dairy and I thought that shitty dairy was a good convo starter. So I turn to my mate and start going off at about how shitty the dairy is because they are super rip off and how the guy behind the counter is a dick and started talking about his monobrow. Turns out that dairy was owned by his family and the guy with the monobrow was his dad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everything that happens can always be proven by science. This could be because we have someone watching over our simulation that looks for glitches. But the one monitoring us can't patch glitches to get rid of them or it would be too obvious. So instead he adds more to the glitch to give it a scientific explanation. An example for this could be the way massive tanks crush themselves by pressure change. Someone witnessed this glitch happen and decided to investigate. While they were investigating a patch is released that had a scientific explanation for the scientists to find instead of them finding out the sim glitched. </TEXT>

Not much of a book reader but there are a lot of TED talks that have made me really push myself into doing what I want to do. I constantly feel like I have no control over my life and that I don't belong here. After discovering TED, I have found so many powerful speeches and presentations that I can relate to and a lot of them have really changed my mindset on how I live my own life.

<TEXT> My neighbours are immigrants from the US and they're used to having a gun in their house for safety. The thing is that here we're not allowed to shoot another person even if its protecting yourself. So when my neighbour went to purchase a gun he and his family got interviewed. So they asked random questions like "Has there been any conflict between you and other people?" And stuff like that. When they asked him what he needs the gun for he answered with in case of an emergency he needs to protect his family. The stopped him and told him to say he needs it for hunting deer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if anybody else is experiencing this problem but i was hoping somebody here would be able to help. 
I'm running this on the latest version of ePSXe with all the plugins and BIN files that are needed. 
When I run the ROM everything runs fine; I get all the splashscreens, the 'Press start" screen comes up and everything. On the loading screens it'll say the text that says "and the adventure continues" or whatever, start menu and options show up fine and I can navigate through it all okay. 
However my HUD doesn't show up at all and the text in the atlas doesn't show up either. 
Does anybody know how to fix this? 

EDIT: A word </TEXT>

I had the phone on my lap and hid it under the table as i loaded up the picture (with shitty school internet it took some time). My 2 mates were sitting on both sides of me and were staring at the image slowly loading. When the image finally loaded they giggled and i giggled a little too. I look up to see the teacher staring right at us looking very confused, shocked and concerned. From he perspective, it looked like i was showing them something other than a funny image. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the past few weeks I've been pranking my programming teacher by leaving the 10 hour version playing on a random locked pc everyday. She had no idea that i was the one leaving it playing and what computer I left it on. 

Just this week she found out that I was the troll that kept the amazing music playing the entire time. To honour my art of trolling, she got the entire class to play the 10 hour version simultaneously the whole period that day. After a countdown from 10, we had it all perfectly in sync the first try. 

RIP School internet.   </TEXT>

They see me walk in and they act fast. One runs to the urinals and one started washing his hands. I didn't think much of it so i just walked over to the urinals to do my thing. Then they start giggling out of nowhere and it went on too long for comfort. I walked over to wash my hands but they didn't move but continued to giggle. As a walked out still wondering what the fuck were they doing to this day. </TEXT>
