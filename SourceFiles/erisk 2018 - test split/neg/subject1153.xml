<TEXT> If humankind could have shed off the belief of the supernatural to explain natural phenomena, perhaps we could have ended up in a better state.

We tried that during the French Revolution and various experiments with communism, and it turned into a murderous bloodbath. The Crusades and the Inquisition were perpetrated by papists, not true Christians. We know this because the Protestant Reformation put an end to the Dark Age and freedom of religion, press, conscience, became possible after America was founded. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The type of people willing to engineer WW3 are not necessarily solely motivated by profits. The most dangerous are in fact religious zealots. 

Neocons are merely playing their part in a Jesuit agenda. [Jesuits aka the Illuminati.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt)  

Jesuits are in fact loyal papists with a long track record of instigating wars since their inception. They see themselves as a military order. Perhaps that's why Hitler modeled the SS after them. Do yourself a huge favor and look into it.

<TEXT> As we speak, Trump is being co-opted by the same neoconservative types who had foreknowledge of the 9-11 plot and allowed it to happen so that we could live in a police state under mass surveillance and be in a perpetual state of war against enemies we literally created. 

Why would you put it past these people to launch a false flag EMP strike? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're needlessly grasping at straws. Very serious people talk seriously about this threat being real. And when somebody like Woolsey talks about an EMP as an imminent threat, you have to consider the possibility of a false flag EMP blamed on the North Koreans to justify WW3. Kindly take your head out of the sand and face reality for the sake of your loved ones.

<TEXT> My guess is that they've checked out my post history and seen for themselves that I'm 100% legit. I explain whats going to happen *BEFORE* it happens. I explained how the Russiagate narrative was going to be destroyed and then it happened just as I said it would. That's truly Earth-shattering and you're having trouble wrapping your mind around it like so many others. You need to just let go and accept the fact that I'm right and you need to find Jesus ASAP. </TEXT>

Weeks ago, I clearly explained to reddit how the Russiagate narrative was going to fall apart. It fell apart exactly as I said It would, and now the Truth narrative has taken over. There's absolutely nothing you people can do about it but seek shelter in the irrelevant echo chamber that is /r/politics.

<TEXT> Seems people like you will never get it no matter how many times its explained to you. This is not about Rush. Its about his huge audience which made Trump's impossible win possible, and now serves as the backbone of the revolutionary Trump movement which is threatening the entire global criminal order. It's about his words which resonate with so many people because they ring true. 

Its about the fact that I told everyone that this Russiagate narrative was going to get destroyed BEFORE it got destroyed. 

Now the top post on Reddit is a CNN propaganda piece featuring some irrelevant compromised politician opining that he thinks some Trump associates will be going to jail. I guess as soon as this "investigation"/attempted coup wraps up that'll happen and Trump the Russian agent will finally be cleared of any wrongdoing. Lmao </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since basically the Obama administration has sort of loaded this with these rule changes and all to allow for leaks the fact that there is no smoking gun of Trump administration collusion with Russia indicates that there isnt any. There is nothing substantial here because a juicy morsel like that would certainly have been leaked by the same people that have been leaking everything else. The fact it hasnt been leaked out means it does not exist, 
some of the Russia hysteria came from imputing sinister motives to conventional business dealings, arguing that Trumps organization made deals around the world, and it is exceedingly difficult to do business with any Russian entity that is not somehow connected to the Russian government.
It shows these people who are doing these gambits are relying on the relative ignorance of the American public of the actual nuts and bolts of intelligence to make their point. Anyone with any background in this stuff can see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to discredit an administration because they were crushed in the past elections.

He literally moved in with Valerie Jarrett and set up an "opposition government" which is actively subverting the republic. That's why there's this absurd witch hunt trying to tie everyone to "the Russians." </TEXT>

They mocked me and banished me and even tried to label me a terrorist a kin to Al Qaeda. Now, unfortunatley I have no Christian fellowship of any kind on Reddit. Oh well they cant mock me now. At least not without sounding like fools. Anyone interested in that shadowbanned account can pm me and I'll send you down a rabbit hole like no other.

<TEXT> the CIA's secret documentary history of the U.S government's relationship with General Reinhard Gehlen, the German army's intelligence chief for the Eastern Front during World War II. At the end of the war, Gehlen established a close relationship with the U.S. and successfully maintained his intelligence network (it ultimately became the West German BND) even though he employed numerous former Nazis and known war criminals.

I think this is interesting given all the hysteria regarding the current US government possibly colluding with Russia. If our government was willing to collude with Nazi war criminals in the past to fight the Soviet Union, that must mean the Soviets were really evil, right? I mean, they must"ve had pretty good reason to work with Nazi's right? Could this part of American history help us better understand whats happening currently with our government possibly colluding with the Russians? </TEXT>

Never seen that before. Some serious games are being played now. Surely /r/conspiracy will have some insightful feedback to share, won't it?

It's a distraction from a much larger issue, which is how [the secret government](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=28K2CO-khdY) is operating above the law to hijack our government through mass surveillance, assassination, and blackmail [according to Bible Prophecy.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Ke7Tn3uOU) The following links will give you a primer:

The funny thing about all these people who clearly don't have a clue about what's happening here is that talking to the Russians wasn't illegal. It's exactly what anyone else in his position would've been doing. Those who leaked Flynn's name to.undermine Trump are the one's who broke the law and are now in deep shit. </TEXT>

The look of utter panic on the faces of Burnett, Gergen, and her entire panel of paid shills as they scrambled desperately for ways to push the "collusion with the White House" narrative was a sight to behold. Surely by now these pathetic anti-American dupes must realize that Trump has been playing them like a fiddle from the beginning, just as I said he was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So much to do about nothing, basically. What do you think nuclear superpowers do? Think critically for just a moment. How many nuclear superpowers exist on the face of Mother Gaia? You should be able to count them with like two or three fingers. Good. Now follow me if you can - what do you think a nuclear superpower does to enhance it's geoplitical sphere of influence? Do you think it *might* include in influencing foreign elections? Do you think it might have something to do with hacking/cyberwarfare? 

The fortunate reality for all the TV bubbleheads whose understanding of how the world works derived solely from watching House of Cards and The Americans on Netflix is that this is how things are done in the real world. It's nothing new. America has done and is doing EXACTLY what it accuses the "evil" Russians of doing, albeit on a [grander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUFhGQ4Do9s) and [MUCH MORE SINISTER scale.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds32xuI_AZI)

I just gave you an *actual example* of the sitting POTUS and the Secretary of State colluding with foreign actors (Nazi collaborator, no less) to overthrow a democratically elected foreign government. You can't refute it. Nobody else can either. An yet you want so desperately to cling to your deluded fantasy that you're going to successfully overthrow the duly elected POTUS. The irrefutable Truth of the matter is that people like you are just as dangerous as ISIS. You're like the walking dead. A zombie. You need miraculous intervention. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Kochs and fossil fuel industry and has spent millions of dollars to try and discredit the science behind climate change.

Ever thought about the possibility that maybe it's worth spending good money to discredit bad science pushed by Mother Gaia-loving, whackjob eugenicists? Because eugenics is at the very root of all this New Agey/Captain Planet/Global Government/Carbon Tax to Save Mother Gaia bullshit we keep hearing about. The kind of scientific fraud brought to light by the University of East Anglia scandal wasn't an outlier, that's actually how these "scientific" frauds operate. Thats why they never talk about the ongoing Fukushima triple nuclear meltdown that is uncontainable and continuing to hemmorhage hundreds of tons of radioactive waste directly into the pacific every day.

I don't have much time to break it all down for you, but consider Al Gore's new Imminent Manmade Climategeddon movie. It's a fucking sequal to the one he did over a decade ago that was proven to be fraudulent. That level of deceit is worth paying good money to expose and ultimately defeat. You can think of Al Gore is the new Paul Ehrlich and Imminent Manmade Climategeddon is the new Population Bomb. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes these episodes raise more questions for me than they answer.

Questions like, why did Dr. P highlight Gorsuch's Jesuit roots only to say that he has "no problems with the Jesuits."? 

Why does he seem to justify illegal mass surveillance? Do the ends justify the means?

Is Dr. P ignorant of Jesuit history? Does he not know how [Zionism and even the state of Israel was created by Jesuits?](http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=58392.0)

Does he not understand how Jesuits throughout history have infiltrated and controlled governments through blackmail and assassination? Does he not understand how the Jesuits instigate their wars? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the Democrats tried to do today was to criminalize everyone who works for better relations between the US and Russia. To be for peace between the nuclear powers is to be a Russian agent and to be put on a list. The Democrats insisted that Russia was an enemy out to get us, and the Democrats had no difficulty getting Comey and Rogers, both Obama appointees, to agree.

Democrats have to be the dumbest humans on the face of the planet. </TEXT>

An example of an unwarranted pattern of life kill is the all too frequent execution of a truck driver squatting by the side of the road to relieve himself, a signature associated with the planting of an Improvised Explosive Device (IED);

(b) Under the Administration of George W. Bush the original mandate  that no kill shot would be taken unless it had a 90 per cent probability of success  was lowered to 50 per cent. Thousands of peoples lives are being taken, illegally, because the White House decided that a flip of a coin could decide their fate;

(c) It was the Administration of Barack Obama that first authorized the use of drones to
assassinate US citizens, and then other Westerners including Germans, with impunity;

(d) The government lies over 80 per cent of the time  from every aspect of the drone program to the actual casualty rates (according to varied other sources, 98 per cent innocents)  were the government in fact accountable to Congress, the Courts, and the public, such a depth of perfidy would appear to warrant the abolishment of that government;

(e) Iranian Press TV has successfully fabricated over 50 alleged drone strikes as a means of angering the global Muslim population and casting aspersions on the integrity of the USG  this point makes it clear just how foolish the American government is to be engaged in an activity that is so actively against all laws, against all common sense, and so easily magnified and used to deepen Muslim animosities toward the United States of America;

(f ) The human toll on the operators of these killing machines is considerable. Prolonged Virtual Combat Stress or PVCS, is a real mental illness that the global drone assassination program has imposed on many good people trapped in a bad system. One of whom, upon retirement, was awarded a certificate of merit for killing over 1300 people by actual count, never mind that over 1270 of them were outright innocents or in US military terms: collateral damage.

There is a wealth of contextual information in this book, Sudden Justice, by Chris Woods. The book does not address the actual financial costs of the program, and the author does not seem to recognize that Syria and Yemen are wars funded by Saudi Arabia in which Hillary Clinton was bought and paid for by Saudi Arabian donations to the Clinton Foundation.4 </TEXT>

<TEXT> In an email exchange with LifeSiteNews, Ehrlich said he was thrilled with the direction Pope Francis is taking the Catholic Church. Speaking to The Guardian newspaper days before the Vatican conference, he suggested that ridding the world of six billion people to bring the population down to one billion would have an overall pro-life effect.

Because the MSM/4th estate shamelessly advocates for Trump's assassination. [Consider this dickless shill for the NYT.](https://www.alipac.us/f12/ny-times-columnist-jokes-about-assassination-attempt-ending-trump%92s-campaign-329316/#post1493393) 

These ~~professional journalists~~ paid shills would never treat Obama, a proven traitor, in similar fashion. They would never suggest that Obama actually worked for foreign interests against the interests of the American people, as he did when he switched sides in the war on terror and willfully gave rise to ISIS. That's the distinction you fail to make. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That kind of talk is nothing new. Keep in mind he's a Republican self professed evangelical Christian. It sorta makes sense that Reddit would shoot that to the top. I'm talking specifically about an instance similar to a sitting President being accused of being an illegitimate racist fascist dictator/Russian agent who was literally put into the White House by "the Russians." That only started after Hillary lost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a mountain of evidence which I don't have the time to type out here, but [the deathbed confession of a CIA legend](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uFAZ8DmcQLg) will suffice for now.

Only by the grace of God is Trump still alive. We know that many on the political Left as well the Right want him dead, including those collaborators in the mainstream media who exert all their effort in an attempt to delegitimize him and paint him as a Russian agent. But the internet and the Truth movement has foiled their plan. Nobody's buying it. Therefore, they realize that if they do kill him, it will only backfire terribly on them. Character assassination is the best they can hope for in this information age.

<TEXT> Michael was a true investigative journalist in every sense of the word. He had balls of steel and wasn't afraid to uncover the secrets of the criminal Shadow Government which has operated above the law with impunity and caused untold misery, death, and destruction for many years. He was willing to go into uncharted territory. With the big story on CIA/Day Zero and the earth-shattering revelation of assassinations via hacked cars, I think we should all honor the great sacrifice Michael made to share the Truth with the world.

Michael, you put your colleagues in the MSM to shame. Where you showed great courage, they showed great cowardice and an eager willingness to mislead the public about the criminal Shadow Government. None of them have the integrity to even mention the Earth shattering revelation that conjures memories of your murder. For shame! You were a true hero and an American patriot. May you forever rest in peace. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, its far more likely that Obama is engaged in an attempted coup based on his proven track record of subversive and treasonous activity. People seem to forget that [Obama became the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/12/04/turley_obamas_become_the_very_danger_the_constitution_was_designed_to_avoid.html)

Obama is the one who consciously of his own free will [SWITCHED SIDES in the war on terror](http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2014/05/02/intel-brief-the-obama-administration-switched-sides-in-war-on-terror/) and [willfully gave rise to ISIS.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/08/10/former_dia_chief_michael_flynn_says_rise_of_isis_was_willful_decision_of_us_government.html#!)

Obama is the one who persecuted the press like no POTUS before him. Obama is the one who used the IRS to persecute his political enemies. Obama is the one who paid the billion dollar ransom to Islamic state sponsors of terror. Obama is the one who installed a neo Nazi puppet government in Ukraine by allowing Nazi collaborator George Soros to dictate US foreign policy in Ukraine. Obama is the one who aligned himself with the terroristic BLM movement, inflaming racial hatred against whites and law enforcement.

Take a look at the top comments in the X-Post in /r/politics that was top of the front page a while ago. All of them completely overlook these facts. A great deception is afoot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, you don't have a clue! 

The game played today by many media outlets is to bury, or completely omit, the question Sessions was actually responding to in his exchange with Franken, and blithely assume he failed to disclose crucial information.
.
He did not reveal the communications at all, however. He did so knowing that Senator Franken was asking about communications with the Russians by anyone working for the Trump campaign, including people who, like Mr. Sessions, had other jobs while they volunteered for the Trump campaign.

The Times have mutated the subject of Sessions testimony to communications by people who had other jobs while they volunteered for the Trump campaign. But the question was about contacts between the campaign and the Russians, not every conversation, about anything, in any professional capacity, by everyone who helped with the campaign, with everyone born in Russia.

When will you people realise that people like Schumer, Franken, and Pelosi are taking advantage of your complete ignorance? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your interpretation of Session's words prove that you don't know wtf you're talking about on this matter. Clearly, the question was not an easy one to answer given his dual role on the SASC and as a part time surrogate of the Trump campaign, and the distinct duties that those two roles entail. Franken knew it was the perfect question to ask because he knew that Sessions duties on the SASC included talking to high level Russian govt officials - some of them spooks, on a regular basis. Franken understands that most on the Left simply can't intellectually grasp the significance of  it. He understands that they're dumb enough to buy into the false narrative that Trump is a secret Russian agent traitor. I mean, lets be honest. Taking advantage of ignorant people is what the Democratic party is famous for.  </TEXT>

He was member of the SASC when he "talked to the evil Russians." Talking to Russian spies is included in his job description. People in general have no clue how the world *really* works. I've decided to dedicate my time here on reddit to explaining how it really works, and all praise be to Jesus, I've been vindicated time and time again.

I mean, really. For fucks sake the stupidity and gullibility of the Left is truly mindblowing How can they not grasp what's going on here? Just consider who's leading the witch hunt. Career criminals like Chucky Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. The true scum of the Earth.  </TEXT>

Where was Burnett to ask the tough questions on that pink elephant?

<TEXT> My point here is simple. You have studied the Enlightenment? Good: You know what I mean when I say we are headed into the Endarkenment. The lights upon us are dimming. We have been more or less abandoned by a press that proves incapable of informing us in anything approaching a disinterested fashion. As suggested, either the media are Clintonian liberals before they are newspapers and broadcasters, or they are servants of power before they serve us. </TEXT>

Trump is going up against widespread systemic criminality in government. That's not something he can do just because he's President. He needs a lot of help.

<TEXT> TEPCO tries to be optimistic, but they really have no idea where the corium is exactly. They don't have good handle on the situation which has been an ongoing unmitigated environmental catastrophe from day one. You asked about the rate  of contamination earlier. Well its roughly 300 tons of radioactive waste water going into the Pacific every day for the last 6 years. We can assume it will be 300 tons per day for at least the next 250 years. This is a huge concern because the "experts" are mistakenly equating radiation from spent nuclear fuel with banana heat, and they're telling everyone that these are safe levels and that the seafood is safe.

<TEXT> The coriums are no longer in containment. They're  deep underground somewhere, contaminating the ground water. That's why they were trying to  collect all of it in massive tank farms up until they decided to "treat" it and dump it directly into the ocean because they were running out of space to store it. Its definitely not a leak. Its an unmitigated disaster on so many levels. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great example, thanks for bringing that up. That's precisely why it was so harmful when [Obama used the media to essentially blame white people and their supposed intrinsic racism](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/obama-war-on-cops-police-advocacy-group-225291) for the persecution of blacks by law enforcement. Basically, he blamed "Whitey" and then seemingly right on cue, Micah Johnson kills a bunch of cops in retribution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The potential harm of live-streaming suicide is very real, said Phyllis Alongi, clinical director at the Society for Prevention of Teen Suicide in New Jersey. It increases the chances of what experts call suicide contagion, which is also common after celebrities kill themselves.

Suicide contagion sounds really lame. It sounds like something we should try to prevent if at all possible. I mean, imagine if this thing really catches on like wildfire. That's a lot of dead people and many more who will be traumatized by watching them die.

The proof is in the pudding. BLM has been exposed as a govt-sponsored hateful ideology, not a group. There are no declared members of this "group" known as BLM. The BLM message of hate simply spreads like a virus much like "radical Islam" does. There are no official "members" of "radical Islam." They all just think they're doing God's work.

[Obama literally admitted that Alex Jones and the "fake news" reports of a few other domestic "partisan news venues" discredited the entire political/media Establishment](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/12/16/obama_foreign_fake_news_doesnt_seem_so_far-fetched_compared_to_some_domestic_propagandists.html) which was relying so heavily on the [nonstop domestic propaganda that said Trump stood zero chance of winning the election and that hell would freeze over if he somehow managed to win.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ46I3kMOr0)

And now that he is President, all we hear from these same discredited sources is "the Russians" this, "the Russians" that. It's so pathetic it's become comical, because these same discredited sources are still claiming that they have credibility. They're like deluded substance abusers who don't realize they need an intervention. They still don't realize that all their credibility went out the window when Trump became President. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Numerous outlets--including Snopes, The Washington Post (of course) and The New York Times--have had to waste valuable time and newshole space to thoroughly debunk these baseless claims 

Why would they have to try so hard? Baseless claims get exposed fairly easily. Just look at what Trump and Putin did to Obama and his baseless claim of "duh Russians" stealing the election. Seems only the dumbest, most uninformed people actually believe it. You have to wonder why snopes, WaPo, and NYT try as hard as they do to reinforce that narrative when hardly anyone buys it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty sure she knows it. It's her high IQ and the area of law she specialises in that leave me with little doubt that she's consciously evil, even though she may very well be a pleasant and likeable person.

She excels in representing institutions and individuals in matters involving allegations of cartel, fraud, money laundering, insider trading, bribery, tax avoidance, and market manipulation and other anti-competitive activity.

There was a high profile case she was working not too long ago involving a bunch of the power elites and their Swiss bank accounts, and how they were not paying taxes. Clearly the law had been broken and any commoner committing the same crime would be dead to rights in prison. But she and another high powered Jewish lawyer convinced a federal jury to acquit because the guy on trial knew where all the skeletons were buried. Some people are too powerful to prosecute apparently.

This is how the world works and they all know it. That's why there's this revolving door culture that sees the top Washington insiders get high paying jobs within the very top law firms tasked with defending the white collar criminals who routinely get away with murder, so to speak.

Take former US AG Eric Holder, for example. When he was done with his criminal ventures in government, this gun grabbing crook took on a lucrative job as partner at her old lawfirm.

The DOJ prosecutor leading the investigation into the LIBOR and FOREX scandals just happened to score a lucrative job at her CURRENT law firm. In order for the privileged power elite to continue hoarding the world's wealth and operating above the law they need an army of highly trained, highly paid lawyers working tirelessly to that end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the dog and pony show they put on. DOJ, CFTC will investigate the big banks knowing they will hire top law firms to get the charges dropped or thrown out altogether.

These lawyers are almost always Ivy League educated, "progressive" leftists, and Jewish. I'm not anti-Semitic. I've made plenty of Jewish friends and growing up my best friend was Jewish. 

I also happen to know one of the high-powered Jewish lawyers who represented several of the big banks under investigation (think HSBC, BoE) for the LIBOR scandal, and is likely still involved in some of the LIBOR investigations that are ongoing. We worked in the same building back when she was fresh out of law school clerking for a federal judge, which really wasn't that long ago. She was a really nice, attractive girl known for her great stamina and leftist progressive ideology.

Turns out she's been very busy representing elitist interests since then, which I find especially disturbing given how genuinely sweet of a person she seemed to be back when she was clerking. I mean, her resume literally reads like she's been working exclusively for the Illuminati since then. I guess evil has many faces. </TEXT>

Wtf? Why are you people so preoccupied with lecturing other people on how to communicate, when most of you folks have a tendency of not knowing what you're talking about or complaining about. 

Get this clear: *Nobody's preventing you from entering a challenge.* You're simply tired of losing the argument repeatedly because your credibility is shot. The problem you people are having is that you're terrible at honest debate which is why you want the government to intervene and censor free speech.

<TEXT> So going back to what Obama said:

"If fake news that's being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it's not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect," 
 "It doesn't seem that farfetched compared to some of the other stuff folks are hearing from domestic propagandists."
"if that's the story that is being put out there, then when a foreign government introduces that same argument, the facts are made up, voters who have been listening to that stuff for years, who have been getting that stuff every day from talk radio or other venues, they're going to believe it

The implication is clear that Putin and "domestic propagandists" like Alex Jones put Trump in the White House. How else could it have played out that way were it not for Trump repeating the same talking points which resonated with the American public? Were Trump voters merely unwitting agents of Putin as well? </TEXT>

<TEXT> But that doesn't answer the question. Why would POTUS along with the entire political Establishment and mainstream media be in literal panic mode concerning Alex Jones - the figurehead of the conspiracy/alternative media movement? The work of James O'keefe and Julian Assange are regularly covered on his show, in fact I believe they may even be regular guests. So why don't their own batshit crazy views discredit them? They don't even have a real presence in social media, as sites like reddit make sure to marginalize them. You don't see links to infowars making it to the top of r/news or r/politics or even r/the_donald, which btw is also prevented from making it to the front page of reddit thanks to new site rules. So what gives? Something is amiss.

I mean, they're actually calling for Congress to get involved to silence these supposed discredited tinfoil wearing whackjobs. Why such a seemingly disproportionate response? It's literally as though they're claiming that Alex Jones and the alternative media put Trump in the White House, which on its face is preposterous. That's the sort of drivel that should be at the top of r/conspiratard. </TEXT>

It's a safe bet that he didn't given his Christian duties under the Great Commision. Why would he want to keep it a secret? Why would he not publicly address Fidel's many mortal sins committed against his own people? Seems rather anti-Christ-like behavior if you ask me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know for certain that he's damned. I simply stated that his fate is sealed upon death. And based on what we know about his extremely sinful and unrepentant life, he's likely to be judged harshly when he receives his just reward.

We can also deduce that Pope Francis never really cared much about Fidel's salvation, for if he did, he would've publicly grieved for his sinful state while he was still alive. That's what a real Christian would've done, knowing that reasoning with sinners and praying for their conversion *while they're still alive* is what Jesus commissioned His followers to do. He never taught us to wait until they're dead to convert them. That idea comes from Catholic tradition borrowed from pagans and the apocrypha, not from His Word.

Instead, pope Francis squandered his golden opportunity to reason with Fidel, to pray and call for repentance by completely ignoring the many sins that have been committed by his communist regime. [Pope Francis, being the lukewarm Christian that he clearly is, actually pretended as if no grievous sins had been commited against the Cuban people.](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2015/09/when-francis-came-to-cuba) Evidently, Pope Francis is a politician first, "Vicar of Christ" second. </TEXT>
