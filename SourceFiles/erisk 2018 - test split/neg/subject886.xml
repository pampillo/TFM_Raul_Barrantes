<TEXT> I might be misreading the hostility this particular post is getting, but just to be claer, I am in non way a Trump supporter, as seems to have be an initial assumption made by aullik. 

If true, that would be a pity: I actualy appreciate honest political discussions.

Also, I'm probably not going to offer to upload it here for reasons of privacy, but I actually defend the German labor-management relations system against American cand other misguided critics. I personally believe the German co-determination system is significantly more superior to American labor-management relations. 

More specifically related to this particular post, I believe codetermination has a woefully misunderstood ***positive*** consequential impact on Germany's comparative advantage and macroeconomic strength, one manifestation of which is its trade surplus. 

It would be a damned shame if the "neoliberals" miss this point as they continue trying to ram the so-called Washington Consensus down the world's throat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So you even used the same same title for all your posts.

That's because [most] of the titles are either the original titles of the articles, or the titles of the videos I post. On most occasions, I think it might be a bit disingenuous to post my own title if there is already a titlte that is representative of the material I post.

 Watch your recent activity. And by recent i mean the last months.

I'm the one posting, so I don't really have to watch my activity history. 

 This was your first comment since the 4th of may.

Generally speaking, I don't appreciate [most] of reditt's culture of trolling and general lack of substantive comments. Therefore, I don't see much of a point in replying most of the times, since most of the responses I receive are unproductive, unsubstantive comments that do little in extending on the topic I post on. Your comment reflects my aforementioned aversion.

EDIT: 

Proposal: If you're interested in conversation, bring up a substantive, thougtful point you would like to talke about. 

Forewarning: I will likely not respond to unsubstantive, hostile trolling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I am not part of an astroturfing campaign.

As I have mentioned to RebasKradd a few times, I generally [and perhaps slightly pretentiously] don't like to engage in many conversations on Reddit. In my experience, there are a lot more trolls commneting than real people interested in genuine dialogue. 
At times, when I find honest conversation, I reply. 

I apologize if my posting activities are kinda confusing; but I promise you, I am posting on my own volition and not part of any nefarious astroturfing campaign.

For the record, I've noticed this subreddit is more substantive and a lot more conversational than most, which I really appreciate. This subreddit defies my general cynicism when it comes to subreddit culture.

EDIT: If anyone here would be interested in a substantive reply or comment on my part, feel free to ask. I love conversation - particularly political conversations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would think so. Offset Tillerson's (Exxon and Big Oil's) influence. However, if this campaign gets just enough attention, Elon Musk will probably feel it is in his and his companies' interests to be more outspoken and publicly assertive. Once Elon feels it necessary to be more outspoken and assertive, I believe this campaign should end - otherwise, Elon would lose any leverage he could have gotten from the campaign.

But for the record, I do not see the benefit of Elon leaving an advisory role in the White House. Unless Elon becomes involved with an uprising or revolt of the more 'forward-thinking'' advisers (that'd result in either a coup, Trump being forced to resign, or Trump losing in 2020, all of which I'd support).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rarely is it possible to get a decent paying job in the US without going getting some form of undergraduate degree. And mostly, a Masters is the very minimum requirement for most  white-collar jobs.

The U.S. has very few apprenticeship opportunites. The only equivelent we have are 6-month/1-year internships. Often unpaid ones. Unless the internship is on Wall Street or at a top-tier law firm, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You ***do*** realize that open borders is supported by the anarcho-capitalist position, right?

The support of bordered ethno-police states expressed throughout this subreddit is deeply confusing and profoundly troubling. 

What gives you the monopolistic right to [seek rent](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp) in this country's job market just based on your place of birth and ethnicity? 

Do you think just because you were born in this country, that somehow endows you with an inherent capitalist ability and commercial aptitude that is automatically superior to immigrants'?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, but when the integrity of jobs data is threatened and manipulated - whether rightly or wrongly - basic income can become more necessary to offset such distortions/make it irrelevant to workers' welfare.

Alternatively, if these distortions lead to a rosier picture of the job market than reality, basic income's opponents might have an easier time supporting their claim that basic income is unnecessary.  </TEXT>

Comparing a defender of Perez to an enabler of Trump or a neocon is breathtakingly ignorant, and I have no response to you that will convince you otherwise. All I can say is this: **Read a history book for once**. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's important to keep on emphasizing the fact that Trumpism ***is not*** traditional conservatism. Trumpism is a form of ***right populism*** .

I don't think my friends on the right-of-center would disagree when well-meaning leftists make the mistake of calling Trumpsim conservative. 

The above article is yet one more attempt to correct this faulty assumption. 

A phenomena that makes this clearer is something that is happening on the most extreme Left: Many well-meaning friends on the purist Left reflexively conflate "populism" with "progressivism" - and this, while appearing to be an innocent mistake, can be ***very, very dangerous***.

At the end of the day, left populism [shares many](https://ideas.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/liberals-vs-populists-its-a-long-story/) of the [same fundamental assumptions](http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=30088) behind right populism, and Trumpism represents these [common assumptions](http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/17/populism-replacing-conservatism-winning/) - namely, ethnicist and other identitarian assumptions couched in paranoia (this is why the alt-right employs traditionally leftist-populist language, and Europe's new socialist politicians employ anti-immigrant messaging). Bernie Sanders [himself gave air to these implicit identitarian assumptions in his critique of  open borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-k6qOfXz0). So this is a problem for both Conservatives and Republicans ***and*** Liberals and Progressives and Democrats to fix.

We need a transpartisan coalition that stands up ***against*** the breakdown of our traditional liberal order (I don't mean "liberal" in the sense that the GOP uses as boogeymen). The reality is, today's brand of populism is a unique threat to any bipartisan and transpartisan consensus, for the very reason that it is left populism and right populism that ***rejects*** the idea of bipartisanship and transpartisanship, and ***rejects*** what movements like NeverTrump stands for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the record, I wasn't asking for thought control. 

I was just getting frustrated that Turless seemed to ignore that the blog I linked to clearly wasn't meant as an attack on Trump.

What frustrates me is that any critique of *any* right-of-center or conservative position [i.e., Islamophobia] from a left-of-center position is deemed not credible or invalid - even though a very similar critique is held by other conservatives and others on the right. Whether aware of Islamophobia's critics on the conservative right or not, Turless's initial comment seemed to imply that since the link was to a left-of-center perspective (even if it had nothing to do with attacking Trump) and that I myself am left-of-center on many issues, it does not matter that my intention behind posting this article (praise the appointment decision b/c of McMaster's ant-Islamophobia stance) is shared by many conservatives.

That left me to believe that the fact that the critique of Islamophobia came from a left-of-enter perspective invalidated the whole thing in Turless's perspective, which thus means that his main beef with the post is the identity of the poster (me) and the identity of the blogger ('people like me'). 

He himself wrote that this sub is only meant for right-of-center NeverTrumpers in one of his follow-up comments. So regardless of him trying to say that he separates identity from politics, it sure did seem like he didn't like the identity of those positing the political critique, and attacked the critique based on that identity. 

If I remember correctly, that is not the idea behind this sub. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, I do attribute many if not most of my political persuasions to a large part of my identity - and I do not believe [or at the very least do not understand] - how anyone else ***does not*** have political persuasions strong enough to form at least part of their identities. 

I know you might not care, but I'll offer this as an example: I am an American Jew with grandparents who survived the Holocaust. Their children - my father and uncle - were bullied, harassed, and assaulted almost every single day walking back and forth from school up through high school. Being recent immigrants from Israel, they were targeted based on their immigrant identities. Some of those beatings would have killed them if police had not intervened. And the guys who did these things were thoughtless idiots who would call what they did as "harmless trolling" - because they were taught by subversive "pop" or "alternative" figures that that was "funny," and that "triggering" them will "toughen them" up.

Being vicitimized by Hitler's political project starting at a very early age, my grandmother was emotionally and psychologically stunted from a very young age, and she remained so until her death a few years ago.

As a consequence of her inability to relate to other humans in an emotionally-mature way, or to relate to the world in a psychologically-healthy way, my father and his brother's lives were infested by the shell of a human being Hitler gave them. Whenever I asked why my grandmother called them 24/7, shouted at them, spoke about fake neo-Nazi conspiracies of her neighbors experimenting on her through the walls, etc., my father did his best to explain to me that she was a broken, damaged woman. I then asked my father and my uncle if they believed that their mother loved them, to which they said no. Being young, I was confused, and they tried to explain to me that when someone is broken like that at a young age, they are unable to grow or develop properly - including emotionally and psychologically. 

My father and his brother were very important, very formative figures in my life, and I unfortunately lost both at a young age. 

I am not trying to tell you a sob story to get you to sympathize with me or whatever. I just want you to know how someone's identity can both ***be*** politicized (by seeing how a mother can mistreat her own sons she could never love, all because she didn't have time to grow into a full human being), and ***political*** (by choosing to turn my own feelings of confusion, frustration, and nostalgia for a family I could never have into a desire to ensure that others can have what I did not).

My personal opposition to President Trump is that he seems to inspire a very similar culture of xenophobia, nativism, and ethno-nationalism that my own family barely survived. And whether he meant to or not, he certainly does not seem to feel the need to temper it. As I [wrote in another comment in this sub before](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeverTrump/comments/5vq4n4/young_white_men_are_being_radicalised_its_time_to/de6bpwy/?utm_content=permalink utm_medium=user utm_source=reddit utm_name=frontpage), "trolling" might start out as fun or innocent enough, but my own history and childhood teaches me that what "trolling" unleashes can frequently be ***very*** difficult to put back in the bottle, and have very severe, unintended consequences - consequences that can survive generations. 

Beyond this, I personally believe it is ludicrous for someone to see themselves or their identity as something that is ***beyond*** politics. All of us - being members of communities, neighborhoods, countries, families, etc. - have either been impacted, shaped, or participated [whether willingly or not] in some form of political project not necessarily thought of by themselves. For me, ***the personal is the political***, and I mean no offense by this, but I think it'd be deeply disingenuous of you to suggest none of your political views were previously formed on a level as deeply entwined as your identity or who you choose to be. 

In a sense and possibly to his strategic and/or tactical credit, President Trump has identified this as a way to pull the country further into his camp: he identified "the establishment" as his enemy and the enemy of "the people" (language that personally disturbs me given my family history), which ***does*** have transpartisan appeal (President Trump himself praised Bernie Sanders for 'getting it right' this way, one reason why I refused to support Sanders). 

I don't like the politics that is one premised on having enemies. To me, that is a politics of reaction - a politics of ***resentment***. 

President Trump himself might not have wanted this, but he both inspired and ***inflamed*** a particular type of identity politics that cannot function without demonizing "multiculturalism" or others he deems as un-American. Many of his supporters support him ***because*** they pride their identities over others'. ***That*** is the right's version of ***"identity politics"***. 

On the extreme left - the left that Sanders identified with - the essential premise of that political argument is that all issues of racial equality, gender equality, etc., are solely and exclusively derivative of an economic nationalism. Sanders' - and Sander's himself - might not have realized, but that is where they are more closely aligned with Trump's most extreme supporters. His economic populism and the economic nativism President Trump campaigned on are ***very, very*** similar things. The reason why is that both of these strands of thought ultimately come down to identity: ***Who was here first***, ***What was an acceptable community before***, and etc., etc., which is why self-described progressive Millennials nowadays who don't know history [do not understand Sanders' own opposition to open borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-k6qOfXz0), but what their older progressive cohort understood and sometimes even admired. 

As a an American Jew who is very familiar with Jewish-American history, this allows me to understand what my well-meaning friends on the Left could not: moderates and centrists do not place themselves "in the middle" or "in the center" because they are soulless or without ideological fervor. They place themselves there because they know that ***both*** extremes - on the left ***and*** the right, aspire to a politics that is one premised on identity instead of politics that aspire to create or recreate a world that is ***comfortable with*** and ***not fearful*** of ***including others who do not share our particular identity*** in our own political communities. The idea that ***any*** politics that is one based purely on ideas and principles without any reference to identity - while at times admirable - has often never succeeded.

To me, this common - if not subconscious - strand of identity politics reveals itself when people who self-id as all political stripes actually are quite supportive of government-provided social safety-nets and welfare programs [***until they are asked if they support those programs if recipients are of another race or cultural identity***](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/kuziemko-norton-saez-stantchevaAER15.pdf). 

European Jewish emigres post-WWI and post-WWII - many of whom went from being socialist and communist to "neoconservative" or "Cold War liberals" - became disenchanted with the American Anti-War Left ***precisely because*** the American Left refused to see the failures and the totalitarian monstrosity of the USSR or of China, nor did they see the urgency of opposing Hitler, while they continued to vilify diversity issues as mere distractions on the way to a "communist utopia". 

As secular American Jew from a family of Holocaust survivors, I inherited this history, and I inherited - so to speak - the "center" between Left and Right - just because Jews have known persecution from all sides, and so we are particularly weary when a politician becomes a leader of a country based on resentment towards immigrants.

S, whereas I find it a shame that politics cannot seem to fully escape the confines of particular identities, this is exactly why I ***choose*** to allow my American Jewish identity inform my political affiliations: As someone who wants to be able to speak with and hear the concerns of supporters of a man who politicize their ethnic pride and nativism, I cannot confine myself to abstract conversations about ideas, nor do I have time for the political circle-jerks you seem so intent on identifying me with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh yes, I know. I quoted that to you as well. And that's why I'm still here talking with you. 

I just said that this sub is not only for critiques of Trump from the right-of-center or the more traditionally conservative base.

I assume your initial comment meant that since I might be centrist or left-of-center, or a Hillary supporter, my critiques of Trump [***which my post you seem to have not read wasn't***] are invalid and not credible. I see that as an attack - when you posit that some form of my identity by necessity invalidates one of my viewpoints, that at the very least demeans and debases those views. 

And for the record, summing up my political positions by calling me a "Hillary supporter" is ***exceedingly*** reductive. 

/r/NeverTrump is supposed to be a corrective to this kind of reductionism. [RebasKradd](https://www.reddit.com/user/RebasKradd), please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this sub is to reorient the entire political conversation ***away*** from such reductive binaries. President Trump won based on a strategy that went ***beyond*** these, and the only way to hold him accountable is to do the same. </TEXT>

<TEXT> McMastter, who is a Trump appointee, has resisted the undeniable urge of many in our national security community and our military to [counterproductive marginalization](http://www.vox.com/world/2017/1/29/14426892/trump-muslim-immigration-refugee-ban-isis-terrorism) of an entire faith (in this case, Islam).

McMaster realizes that if policies are seen to be discriminatory against the Islamic community, that only helps our enemy (ISIS, al-Qa'ida, etc.) in their propaganda war against us. 

Case in point: Whatever you refer to it as, the relatively recent order President Trump signed barring certain populations from countries which happen to be majority-Muslim has [already been adopted as recruitment and radicalization propaganda](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/trump-ban-boosts-isis-recruitment/) by ISIS and other jihadist groups in their effort to show Muslims that the United States is at war with Islam.

**EDIT**: If anything, this article is ***commending*** President Trump for appointing McMaster, which might be indicative of a policy discipline critics may have previously missed.

PS: I do not appreciate personal attacks (particularly attacks that lack substantive counter-points), and it is against the transpartisan spirit of this sub.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trolling can take on very real, tangible consequences, however. 

Even if we give Trump the benefit of the doubt, and say that Trump unintentionally activated, mobilized [or "radicalized"] a whole bunch of angry, disconnected voters, it does not follow that Trump is not at fault for hateful or even violent behavior done in his name. 

The fact is, he is now President of the entire country, and one subset of the populace [the stereotype of the "angry white male"] is increasingly violent to another subset [or a few others: minorities, immigrants, LGBTQ, "liberal snowflakes", etc.]. It's the President's ***job*** to at least ensure that this "trolling" does not go from being "a blast" to getting in the way of leading the country in a unified direction. In fact, he got that message when he was [made to tell his supporters to "stop it"](http://www.vox.com/2016/11/17/13639138/trump-hate-crimes-attacks-racism-xenophobia-islamophobia-schools), which I'd assume helped some but [not by much](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/racist-incidents-after-trumps-victory?utm_term=.uhjv2Ba6a#.mu27XWzGz). So, assuming that Trump is very well-intentioned, "trolling" done in his name is largely his responsibility to stop. As a former businessman, he should be well-aware of how image and brand are essential to leadership. 

As [RebasKradd](https://www.reddit.com/user/RebasKradd) says, these trolls are hurting the credibility of the conservative movement or the "saner" elements of his supporters. Trump won't be able to lead without that credibility, so it's his job to fix it. GOP leaders can't necessarily do this, as this Pew poll [reveals that more of his supporters trust him over them](http://www.people-press.org/2017/02/22/in-trump-era-what-partisans-want-from-their-congressional-leaders/). And it's ludicrous to think that the media, or the Democrats, or teachers, or therapists, should carry that load [or even that they can ***succeed***]. If Trump wants to be an effective leader, he cannot keep passing the buck and shrug off any responsibility. He cannot have large numbers of his supporters believing he's doing and saying one thing, while another part of of his supporters believes he's doing or saying something else. That does not make a good leader. How can he lead a country and while his own supporters don't know or don't agree on what he is asking of them? Leaders - at least those who want to lead a transpartisan or unified country - do not leave that kind of ambiguity out in the open. 

As numerous reports by civil rights groups and nonpartisan think tanks document, such as [this one](http://bridge.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/When-Islamophobia-Turns-Violent.pdf), that violent incidents towards minority communities have been committed, and the perpetrators consistently cite Trump, it at least stands to reason that Trump would decisively and directly say that he disavows any and all of this violent behavior done in his name. As said above, he did do this in one interview, even he would have to acknowledge that did not get to the more denser idiots (he has numerous times suggested that none of his supporters watch or trust the "mainstream media"). I would personally prefer him to use a few press conferences and even mailers, and his rally speeches, to tell the idiots to stop ruining his brand and let him and his saner allies and base lead the country. 

It might arguably be too late, and I don't see why Trump can credibly say that he's completely without fault in any of this - he ***literally*** called many undocumented immigrants ["rapists," portraying a whole swath of undocumented Mexican immigrants as drug-dealing violent criminals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/?utm_term=.090d828b82cf). 

How can someone ***not*** understand that his supporters support him ***because they like what he says***? This seems to be pretty basic stuff: And I'm sorry, the excuse being thrown around that the unhinged subset of his base ["took him seriously, but not literally"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/people-were-taking-trump-seriously-now-theyre-starting-to-take-him-literally-too/2017/01/25/dc86447e-e31d-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html) ***clearly*** [do not pay much attention](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/peter-thiel-perfectly-summed-up-donald-trump-in-one-paragraph.html) to violent incidents targeting the very same population Trump used to mobilize his base. The business leaders Trump says he wants to make deals with on behalf of the country [don't believe or take literally what he says or tweets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-21/trump-was-taken-seriously-by-ceos-at-davos-but-not-literally). As left-of-center comedian John Oliver [summarized in one segment of his show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xecEV4dSAXE), it's never a good sign when large pockets of the country don't know what Trump means when "he says words". Trump himself has mocked, ridiculed, and dismissed this confusion, [suggesting that it is ridiculous that the media takes everything that he says so seriously](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/trump-mocks-media-for-thinking-he-means-anything-he-says.html).

I hope we can all put our previous partisan loyalties aside and agree on the basic idea that a leader should take his own words seriously and treat them with the gravity, clarity, sincerity, and weight his supporters and allies believe them to have. If he doesn't take this responsibility seriously, he is more suitable for private life. </TEXT>

Of course not relieving Congressional Republicans of any responsibility, but we as a country tend to somehow believe Congress will care about the concerns of a silent majority. Being a majority is meaningless if we don't act.

Trump will ruin the GOP and trigger an entire realignment if responsible Congressional Republicans and their constituents don't speak out. And the realignment will come faster if the country sees that no one in the GOP is willing to stand up to Trump. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you kidding me?! Bernie Sanders' whole platform was that the Democrats were too centrist, and that he was the only one to offer real revolutionary change that would upend the entire system.

You've got it backwards: The "anti-establishment" crowd bought into Bernie's "Not good enough" rhetoric. 

And btw, minor detail: Hillary won the popular vote by almost [2.9 million votes](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/21/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-popular-vote-final-count/), the largest anyone has ever won without becoming President.

If you also mean to imply that Trump's "anti-establishment" message worked, then can you explain to me why Hillary Clinton won [low-income and poorer Americans](http://www.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> that seems to be letting Millennials off the hook prematurely. Citizenship used to demand responsibility, self-awareness, and a willingness to learn what makes our communities better.

Democracy demands that we, as responsible voters, do not settle for caricature, and that we do our own research. Democracy is a job, and if we let GOP caricatures dissuade us from voting for her, we failed at our job.

In the age of information, ignorance is a choice. Defending apathy by pointing to clearly false caricatures does not absolve us of that choice. Too many of us ***chose*** to be lazy this time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And like it or not, it looks like Trump's campaign was not seen as legitimate either by a credible majority of American voters either, so in actual fact, if the EC were to vote based on both popular will and its intended purpose, we'd still end up with Clinton.

And by the way, until you address any of the argument I used to support the above conclusion, which I honestly don't think you invested much thought in, I agree with you that further conversations is unfortunately pointless. 

You might ***disagree*** with me on the original intent behind the EC, but that doesn't mean I avoided addressing it in any of my previous posts. 

What's a real shame is I see us fracturing over principle and party loyalty. And the trick Trump played on us all is making us think he was something [he is clearly not](http://www.mediaite.com/online/trumps-base-of-supporters-clearly-doesnt-care-that-hes-already-broken-campaign-promises/)- loyal to a party you nonetheless seem willing to pledge fealty to.

<TEXT> My point is that the Founding Fathers did not want, nor would they legitimate, a system the allowed a demagogue into the WH. They did not want us to fight a Revolution only to have us embrace a wannabe king.

Repeat: They did not want a system - and warned against any system - that would allow Trump to happen.

I am not the one reaching here. The Founding Fathers would not settle for short-term expediency over bigger longer-term principles, and I'm surprised that we are letting ourselves be sucked into the same argument on popular [***populist***] expediency that the Founders saw as anathema to a free and well-governed society.

The entire reason why we transitioned from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution was to prevent unpredictable, instantaneous disruption from spontaneously crashing the American consensus. To the Founders, change and political evolution were necessary. But they would also agree that once we had our initial American Revolution, political change in this country had to take on a less disruptive, more evolutionary character. As a student of American history, I believe that at this time, if the Founders saw Trump, they would see him as a more dangerous disruption than they see Clinton. 

And as to the question of "maturity": The Founders ***debated*** and talked about the maturity or lack thereof of the electorate. That's the very question they were talking about when they were talking about [factions](http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2015/09/04/federalist-10-the-power-of-factions/). This question of "immaturity" - or how I would exchange that with a more political term - ["populism"](http://thefederalist.com/2016/03/22/donald-trump-displays-the-perils-of-populism/) - was very much on the minds of the Founders. I would agree with that.

But they would say the onus of maturity should be shared by the electorate, and they would certainly see a Presidential campaign won on the insurrectionist manipulations of fear, anger, rage, and a vague, undirected desire for disruption [to be illegitimate and unworthy of office](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/trump-founding-fathers-electoral-college-213777).

And like it or not, it looks like Trump's campaign was not seen as legitimate either by a credible majority of American voters either, so in actual fact, if the EC were to vote based on both popular will ***and*** its intended purpose, we'd still end up with Clinton. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I guess a lot of us here would implicitly acknowledge three things:

1) Our Founding Fathers rebelled against a foreign empire.

2. Putin, the head of a ***completely different country*** (Russia) helped install Trump through a [deliberate information warfare campaign](http://www.vox.com/world/2016/11/1/13487322/donald-trump-russia-agent-hack).

3. Trump [***cheered*** this on, to the point of ***asking them to do more of what they were doing***](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html).

If we can agree on all of these three things, we can thereby conclude two more things:

1) **Trump didn't care if he won an American election fairly**.

2) He went beyond the pale of American politics ***to a foreign entity*** to win.

Meaning:

3) ***He didn't win our American election by American rules***

So, the question I pose now: Why do we expect or want ***American rules*** set up for the ***American political system*** to protect and legitimate a cheater who won by ripping to shreds American rules [i.e., no foreign influence in our elections]? </TEXT>

He definitely is not a Democrat - we all hopefully agree with that fact. The key now is to ***stop*** thinking of him as a ***Republican*** too. He is not a ***normal*** symptom of the two-party system, and certainly was never the type of figure our Founding Fathers would be comfortable with.

NeverTrump didn't start as a philosophically or politically binary movement. We should not end in binary thinking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Clinton likely won the popular vote by [more than 2 million](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/opinion/clintons-substantial-popular-vote-win.html?_r=0). And when all is said and done, Clinton is [estimated to have a 2% lead in the popular vote by mid-December.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/clintons-popular-vote-lead-will-grow-and-grow/507455/)

2. The Electoral College [was designed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/douglas-anthony-cooper/the-electoral-college-was_b_12897066.html) to prevent populist demagogues from being voted in on the backs of mass anti-federalist insurrectionary hysteria.

3. If we can both agree on the popular vote count, petitioning the Electoral College to vote against a populist, insurrectionary demagogue fulfills ***both*** the ***will of the people*** *and* the ***Founder's intent*** in creating the EC.

***EDIT*** This is ***no longer a Republican vs. Democrat election***. Trump has demonstrated ***clear loyalties*** to a fundamentally illiberal political ideology, in both his appointment of Bannon and his [praise of Putin and other dictators](http://www.weeklystandard.com/ad-trump-loves-dictators/article/2001319) makes clear to me that what is at stake is no longer the political platforms or ideological differences between America's two main parties, and it is no longer GOP vs. Democrat, or was it ever just Trump vs. Clinton.

<TEXT> By you refusing to vote for her, you "voted" for him. That's how presidential democracy with two major parties work. There's no such thing as "not voting," because even you protest votes or your inactivity affects me.

So, even if you didn't vote for him, and you either voted third party as protest or refused to vote at all, you clearly didn't care if he got into power.

You wanted a voice, and you wanted to say something? That's what I heard. I heard nothing else.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think That both reasonable Republicans and reasonable Democrats should now set their differences aside [for the time being], and try to create a coalition to ensure that Trump stays accountable to the Democratic project. 

I think one good place to start in trying to form such a coalition is the [American Solidarity Party](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/a-different-conservatism/), a party in the mold of Merkel's [Christian Democratic Union](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2016/08/could-the-u-s-finally-get-a-significant-christian-democratic-party/), that is traditional and conservative on social issues and pro-life issues, but embraces some left-of-center proposals on economic issues. 

In my mind, the most ardent NeverTrump supporters will never have a respected place in Trump's Republican Party, and enough Democrats who supported Clinton would feel so betrayed and disgusted by protest voters in their own party, that those two factions will be disgusted enough by their former allies to be open to starting a newly empowered coalition in the political center.  I truly think that this new coalition - if we work towards it together - has a chance to be more powerful under a Trump presidency than either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.

Just the beginning of a thought process... Let me know if any of you are interested. </TEXT>

<TEXT> John McCain was one of the last presidential candidates to give voice to this fundamental truth: No matter how we vote, or what Party's ticket we run on, we are all American. Regardless of your own personal political beliefs, I say without very little uncertainty that this was one of the best and one of the most courageous campaign moments this country has ***ever*** experienced.

Sometimes, we disagree on where our country needs to go, but we should never forget what John McCain once reminded us: When we get there, we get there ***together***. We are the **United** States Of America.

So, please - no matter who your friend, your neighbor, or your family votes for [even if they vote for Trump], ***do not see them as "the enemy"***. 

See them as McCain saw Obama in 2008: **As a decent American**

 "So, let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal."

<TEXT> And what makes Lee and Paul so popular with ***both*** the GOP establishment ***and*** the Tea Party, is, like Ryan, they stick around even for policy fights they used to criticize as rigged. hey know that, rigged or not, it's the system you have to work with if you want to change it from the inside. They know you can't play checkers on one board as the GOP establishment plays chess on another board. It's not enough to say that the game is rigged and insist on forfeiting the game completely. You play it to learn how to beat it. And politics is a process. It takes a little while. But yet, Ryan, Lee, and Paul aren't going anywhere, and neither are they trying to tear down their Party. They are playing for keeps - they are playing the long game. And they know that they need to keep the GOP alive long enough to take it over.

They need the GOP as much as the GOP needs them. Just like we need to realize that we need to be able to take over the Democratic Party from the inside. And that won't happen is we abandon Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party. Paul Ryan, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul could have tried to abandon the GOP and take over a 3rd party that they were more ideologically-aligned with [like the U.S. Constitution Party]. But like the Green Party and the Libertarian Party, that third party doesn't have anywhere near the power or influence of either of the two main parties. So they decided to work within one of the two central parties.

Noticed that ***none*** of the Tea Partiers who swept Congress in 2010 ran on or defected to a third party, non-GOP ticket. They see the GOP as the host, and they are slowly but very effectively infecting their host.

We should take notes and take over the Democratic Party the same way. And that continues by helping Bernie hold a President Hillary Clinton to the promises we put into the party platform. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an example of why a complete and absolute repudiation of Trump and his brand of politics is necessary on Election Day.


We need to "bury" Trump at the polls on November 8th, not only to preserve the legitimacy of American conservatism, but for American liberalism, for American politics, for the American election system, and for the American experiment itself.


No matter what side of the American political spectrum we identify with, this election puts America and its form of government and our way of life on the ballot. I think I can say without controversy here that we were never meant to become a sectarian, xenophobic police state. Even if there are some of us here who would rather minority groups ***assimilate*** into America's traditional way of life, I hope we can all agree that the American experiment was never, ever supposed to be about substituting ***assimilation*** of minority cultures for ***persecution*** of minority cultures. 


Certainly, our country's Founders knew without any uncertainty that our political experiment was necessary ***in order to*** divorce the primitive, sectarian brutality of ***persecution*** from a more "enlightened" gradual and even incremental project of ***assimilation*** through compassionate civic dialogue. This is what the "American melting pot" has always been about: Everyone was welcome in our way of life and to add to our way of life, but in their own time. Our Founders ***knew*** the difference between **evolution** and **revolution**, and saw in their own experience that persecution ***always*** leads to disaffection and revolution, whereas respect for diversity will always lead us on the path of **evolution**.


Trump does not understand this about our American story, nor does he **accept** it. His is a [demonstrably nihilistic worldview where it is the natural order that the strong survive by eating the weak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yh0jAxOxGE). Survival is no longer by honest hard work or effort or civic life, but it is by ***chance***. Either you kill, or you ***are*** killed. In this view, only the "ruthless killers" are worthy of American citizenship - only the ruthless sharks who can kill off his competitors to get to the top of the pack. What this boils down to is a ***cultural eugenics*** - a perverted form of ***Social Darwinism***.- either you find your place ***immediately*** or you're out. No time for you to get on your feet. No patience for circumstance. No empathy or sympathy for the least of thee. If you break a sweat - well, there's no time for that; Trump's America will leave you behind. It doesn't matter if you ***aspire*** to live as a proud American - in the [inverted logic of Trump's cultural eugenics](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/opinion/sunday/the-next-genocide.html), you either "have what it takes," or you don't. Worse still, in this worldview, diversity is seen as ***weakness***. Only the strong survive, and in Trump's dystopia, that means we all lose if America is still a diverse country. 


In Trump's worldview, all of life is competition, and diversity just means a stronger culture has yet to kill off a weaker one. This is not patriotism, nor is it any form of nationalism. It is [***cultural, ethnic, and racial anarchism***](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/hitler-holocaust-antisemitism-timothy-snyder/404260/).


And that brings us back to why Putin is paying trolls to sow discord in our election system, and is trying to radicalize hate and resentment in our society - he wants the world to see that America is just as prone to be taken over by monsters as any other society. Putin knows that his dictatorship does not have anywhere near the unanimous support of his own people - he knows that even if they vote for him, its because of the fear and uncertainty of the unknown. And this is why he supports Trump - if a democracy can be goaded into voting based on xenophobic lies and sectarian paranoia, and if fear and scarcity drives us instead of civic empathy, Putin wins. Putin wins on the domestic front, consolidating his support in the face of increasing peaceful dissent, and he wins on the world stage. If he succeeds in installing Trump as our President, he can show the whole world that democracy is merely a mask for anarchy and chaos. And thus, Trump wil be his message to the world: This is what democracy brings you: ***Fear, violence, chaos, anarchy, and hate.*** 


This is why defeating Trump is not only a Democrat issue, a Republican issue, a Libertarian issue, a Green Party issue, a Constitution Party issue - it is an ***American issue***. And Im not saying its enough to ***beat*** Trump. We have to ***bury*** him. We have to show the world, and those among us who have let ourselves be brainwashed by him, that part of American pride is that we do not tolerate his politics of hate or his politics of fear. We do not accept that America is a hunting ground where the wolves hunt for the lambs, nor can we accept America being made into a [WWE wrestling match in which the strongest narcissist survives by humiliating the weak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypOwLUMUHw0). 


This election is a transpartisan, American election. Hate and fear and prejudice have always been with us. But the point of democracy, ***particularly our democracy***, is to show the world [***and ourselves***] that elections can bring policies that give us the civic space needed to help ***solve*** those fears and those prejudices. Trump sees fear and prejudice as a motivating force - and his answer is that we win when we kill and destroy all that we fear and all that we hate.


Trump doesnt want us to see ourselves as ***Americans***. If we see ourselves as Americans, committed to living in and building a country together, Trump loses. Contrary to Trumps surrogates in the media, most Democrats dont ***hate*** Republicans, most Republicans dont ***fear*** Democrats, Northerners dont ***look down on and vilify*** Southerners, etc. But Trump ***needs*** us to believe this if he is to win. He ***needs*** us to see the world just like he does - a world where anarchy and ruthless competition and chaos is the natural state of things, where a more gradual democratic evolutionism is replaced by a dystopic hybrid between cultural anarchy and [political authoritarianism, where even a lifelong patriot and veterans integrity is questioned because his captivity signals weakness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YU9djt_CQM). Trump wins if more American voters than not allow themselves to believe that honest political disagreement or even peaceful, nonviolent dissent equals a violent betrayal that cannot be solved through the evolutionary project of civic life or public dialogue, or even the dignity of guaranteed citizenship. Trump wins if we allow ourselves to adopt a regressive, immature view of disagreement - if you dont agree with me, youre ***a traitor*** and you are not ***an American***. Thats why birthright citizenship is so important - an American child who grows up here and lives here should feel safe enough to tell her or his government or politicians what they do or do not agree with, without any fear that their citizenship will be stripped from them for speaking up or exercising their conscience. 


Ever since our Founding, this has been our Democratic experiment, It was not always perfect, but it always ***aspired to be***. And thats the difference between how our Founders saw this countrys potential and how Trump sees this country - unlike our politics of ***aspiration***, his is a politics - and a ***culture*** - of fear and of scarcity. In his small mind, diversity and disagreement cannot ever exist ***because we lose our chance to eat***. Were all just basically hunter-gatherers back in anarchic times without nations. Were either the hunters or the hunted.


And if Trump wins, this ideology of depravity and this anarchic fear of scarcity replaces the role of public reason and patient and compassionate dialogue as the driving force of our politics. ***And our American democratic experiment dies***. A country cannot stand on persecution. A country cannot stand, nor survive, by characterizing diversity or disagreement as weakness or ***betrayal***. In America, we embrace diversity. We embrace it because were strong enough to do so without upending our own way of life. Were strong enough to learn from one another and to move the country forward by forming new consensus through dialogue and respectful debate. 


Trump does not understand this, and by all appearances, he ***does not want to understand this*** and even ***rejects what little of it he does understand***. This is why, as a free, strong, and open society, we ***must reject him***. But we must reject him as ***Americans*** - not Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Socialists, Greens, etc. **As Americans.**


And come November 9th and the days and weeks and months and years after election day, the test of our success will be how long we can stay together as **Americans**,  and continue being a culture of strength through diversity.

<TEXT> I never, ever claimed that the person in the photo I posted is me. It is not. 

As to my political identity, I am Never Trump, and my posting history confirms that. I take my opposition to him seriously enough to spread that message to as many subreddits as possible. Even to ones I don't necessarily agree with. Because that's how you build the NeverTrump movement and make sure it survives post-election. 

Conservative and right-of-center Never Trump supporters - like it or not - will need the help of a certain number of Democrats and other left-of-center officials/politicians to make sure Trump or his crazy nuts do not hijack the GOP again.

And yes, the Democrats would want to help the right-of-center Never Trump people since Hillary would need the sane elements in the GOP to be willing to negotiate and govern with her.  </TEXT>

I know many here are anti-Clinton and not necessarily honest supporters of WikiLeaks and I do acknowledge that much of the recent leaks had to do with her, but I also strongly believe that this subreddit is devolving into a very passive bastardization of what WikiLeaks themselves originally to achieve - which is global transparency.

<TEXT> This article is on continuing a progressive movement to pressure Clinton from Congress. This article has very little to do with the actual 2016 Presidential election. 

This has as much to do with Bernie's revolution and our progressive movement sticking around for the 2018 and 2020 Congressional midterms to ensure that progressive leaders in Congress are around long enough to push the President to adopt progressive policies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't I also post articles.

But what I've found is that most people a likelier to click on videos. For some reason, many people seem to think that videos require less time investment.

**EDIT** This seems particularly true with younger people. According to a lot of media consumption studies, younger people tend to prefer video due to the same tendency to believe videos take less time [and less concentration].

Maybe I am over-reading these reports, or perhaps I am too pessimistic towards my generation's literary habits.

<TEXT>  She has declared that she disagrees with the Heller decision and thinks the Supreme Courts has "gone in the wrong direction" on gun control

Clinton has stated that her main concern with the Heller decision was the safety of toddlers, which was [in fact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-supreme-court-gun-decision-de/) the initial [guiding concern of the original petitioners](http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/DC_Final_Petition.pdf). Meanwhile, Clinton has always said [she respects the 2nd amendment and the rights](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/05/trump-distorts-clintons-gun-stance/) it confers to responsible gun owners, and Johnson essentially holds the same position ([particularly on trying to prevent suspected terrorists and the mentally-ill from owning guns](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Gary_Johnson_Gun_Control.htm))

 Hillary "...anti-gay marriage..." Clinton

She is not "anti-gay marriage" anymore. Look it up. [In April of 2000, as NY Senator, she was in support of civil unions, in July of 2004, she opposed a Constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and in October of 2005, she said that deferred to states on the matter of same-sex marriage. She is ***definitely not*** against gay marriage](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/).

Again, I am very disheartened that libertarians would allow themselves to become crazed right-wing conspiracy theorists. It's really, ***really*** depressing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Same for Clinton, and shes the one with a neocon foreign policy

This is a very simplistic view of political dynamics. Ideologically, Trump is a neocon, and he has said neocon things [mostly ending in "... and we'll bomb the shit out of them."]

Clinton, on the other hand, will be faced with a Congress that is ***less*** hawkish than she is. Even if the majority leadership will probably be full of Democrats, the majority will be at the mercy of the anti-interventionist Sanders-Warren wing of their party. 

If Trump gets in, he'll have no such opposition if Ryan survives or he doesn't. Steve Bannon and his Breitbart allies behind Trump will force their right-wing ethnic and economic populism through a fractured Congress [if Congressional Republicans are divided between Trump's allies and enemies].

 What planet are you on? Hillary said entitlements will be solved by increasing benfifits and taxing the rich

Trump's plan involves [raising taxes on the middle-class](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan), including [7.8 million middle-class families](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2842802). As libertarians, we're supposed to be against raising taxes on ***anyone***

Trump's plan will balloon the debt by [5.3 trillion](http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update), while Clinton's would only increase it by $200 billion. Do you mean to say that growing the debt by ***5.3 trillion dollars*** is ***more*** libertarian than growing that debt by ***$200 billion?***.

If you believe that growing the debt by 5.3 trillion is ***less*** libertarian than growing it by $200 billion, you might need to do a few re-calculations. And probably know how numbers work.

Both candidates' tax plans are very important to understand in terms of how they handle entitlements. Trump may cut entitlements, but he's doing so under a very misinformed understanding of reducing the debt. On the other hand, Clinton's entitlement and tax policies show an understanding of how to balance liberal and libertarian priorities 

Again, she may be temperamentally hawkish and pro-government intervention, but her incentives to be bipartisan will outweigh her personal inclinations. At most, her Administration and policy agenda would turn out to be left-libertarian. Why? Because her hawkish tendencies would be dampened by ***both*** Paul Ryan and his right-libertarian Congressional allies ***and*** the Sanders-Warren "progressive populist" wing.

 She also says we can't talk about the Fed Tump at least mentions the Fed.

***Nowhere*** has she said "we can't talk about the Fed". Again, setting up straw man arguments do not help our cause. Leave that to the Alex Jones-Fox News salivating circle-jerk. And Trump says whatever he thinks can get him elected. Do you think he actually ***gives a shit*** about libertarianism or non-intervention? ***He believes in an [over-militarized](http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/23/trump-wants-police-to-keep-getting-milit), [white nationalist](http://rare.us/story/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-are-polar-opposites-and-so-are-ron-paul-and-donald-trump/) police state***. He has even [called for the abolition of legal counsel for suspects](http://reason.com/blog/2016/09/20/donald-trump-vs-the-sixth-amendment) - a right guaranteed by the sixth amendment.

So, do you honestly think that a Trump presidency would be ***more libertarian*** than a Clinton presidency would? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I simply disagree with your assessment.

1) From a ***completely objective, nonpartisan perspective*** you have to acknowledge that Clinton ***never "openly declared" that she wants to "neuter"*** the 2nd amendment. That is a straw man that will do ***absolutely no good*** for the libertarian cause. 

Libertarians at least ***used to be*** known as the most rational, least emotional, most objective and most logical on the American political spectrum. We don't need conspiracy theories to support our ideology - leave that to the anti-Clinton Republicans, or to the Regressive Left.

I disagree he will get nothing done. If Paul Ryan keeps his job, he has promised to railroad ***all of his socially conservative*** agenda down Trump's throat. In fact, if Trump's opponents ***lose*** Congressional majorities, that would be ***even worse*** for libertarians, since Trump ***is definitely*** more at the mercy of right-wing pro-government intervention populism than Ryan ever will be. And as we get closer to the election, Trump looks like he will survive longer than Ryan and the non-interventionist right-wing populists of the GOP.

So, in any scenario in which Trump wins, we ***do get anti-libertarian policies*** - it's only a matter of gradation. 

If Trump gets in and has allies that outnumber his enemies in Congress, he can push his anti-libertarian social agenda through ***and get his SC Justices appointed***. On the other hand, if Ryan and the rest of ***his*** allies survive, we'll only be see a ***slightly less*** anti-libertarian agenda than if Trump gets in.

Clinton, meanwhile, has exhibited ***both*** a libertarian-leaning understanding of the importance of fiscal responsibility, balancing the budget, and of non-government intervention in social lives (***she is socially liberal and more fiscally conservative than Trump***). In other words, she is closer to a ***classical liberal*** than Trump ever was or can be, and classical liberalism is ***closer*** to contemporary libertarian philosophy than right-wing, ethnic, economic populism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see things differently. I don't see this as a betrayal, even if he *does* imply that Clinton is the "lesser evil".

Here, I think it is ***very*** important to point out that third parties have generally been successful in parliamentary democracies, where third parties are likelier to form very strong ad powerful coalitions with other parties (***even parties they opposed previously***).

So, I don't think that paragraph indicates that Weld now believes  that third parties are unimportant - I just think he believes that the Libertarian Party's policies are more likely to be accepted in a coalition with Clinton rather than Trump.

At least, this is what I think is Weld's thought process behind his statement. 

It's easier to look at his reasoning if we assume a parliamentary, coalitional framework rather than a more zero-sum presidential contest. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm wondering why you're talking about "our support" when, judging by your posts, you seem to be an adamant Clinton supporter.
 
^^^^^
Our nominee is Clinton now. Bernie ran as a Democrat, and is calling on us to support her. He ***chose***  not to run for President as an Independent, because he knew he could get more things accomplished if he ran ***as a Democrat***. And getting 80% of his policies in the party platform is proof of that. I noticed that you seemed to not have bothered reading the history of politicians adhering to the party platform. Revolutions depend on fact. I suggest you try it sometime.

And with [a simple statistical analysis](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/upshot/the-senate-votes-that-divided-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders.html?_r=0), Clinton and Bernie are ***much*** [closer ideologically than Bernie is with Trump](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/). So, ***there is*** a ***significantly*** higher probability that Bernie helps lead our revolution with Hillary as President. [That's just a fact](http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/9/15/12923528/liberal-economics-great-recession-policy-clinton). And it has [***always been*** a fact](http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/hillary-clinton-policy-agenda/).

General election are part of our political tradition. And ensuring that a  Democratic President has a congressional majority is ***the*** only way we can shape our country's future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. Feeling indignation in the face of injustice is. And believe it or not, we all have faced - and we will face more - injustices under Trump than Clinton. 

For examples of this, just look at the violence and vitriol Trump has inspired against entire communities of color, the LGBTQ+ community, women, Muslims, immigrants, and essentially non-white, non-conservative, "non-traditional" Americans.

Revolution is about feeling the indignities of other communities and acting on it. Resentment is a childish, narrower version of that. </TEXT>

Also, it doesn't matter if they *"like it"*. They'll be forced to implement it, whether they *"like it"* or not. Their political survival depends on it if they want to survive the 2018 midterms or the 2020 presidential elections. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then you don't know how government works. Nor do you know who Trump really is. He doesn't give a shit about any of us.

The only way Dems elected to a congressional majority will be effective - aside from only being on defense all the time trying to [but failing to] block Trump's platofrm is if we have a ***Democrat*** and/or other progressive as President.

And too many people conflate progressivism and populism. Not saying Donald Trump is either one of those, but Bernie is certainly more of a Progressive than a populist.

There is left-wing populism (i.e., socialist populism), right-wing populism (i.e., social conservatism but anti-monopoly), and straight progressivism, which has ***nothing*** to do with any of the preceding forms of populism.

In this dynamic, the most that can be credibly said about Trump is that is that he is a right-wing populist. Like Hitler, and the anti-immigrant right-wing populists rising up in Europe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the Senate gets a majority, the Senate does. And if Clinton wins, they'll have no choice but to appoint him chairman if we keep up the pressure.

Fact is, if Trump gets elected, Sanders has nowhere near the impact or effect if Trump is President.

I really don't understand what some Sanders supporters don't get about this. It is very simple: Under Trump, Sanders has ***will have absolutely no*** effect at all. Under Clinton, he will.

If our support for Bernie was genuine, we should want him to be put into a position where he can be the most effective he can be, and where he can finally implement the 80% of his policies he was able to cram in the Democratic platform. And fight for more than 80% too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article's text is below:

 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio solicits the opinions of many confidants before making decisions. Then he often disregards their counsel, forging ahead in ways that his inner circle sometimes describes as politically imprudent.

 This year, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has sought to curtail the horse-carriage industry, escalated a fight with one of the citys most prominent newspapers and declined to release his emails with five longtime advisers who work outside of governmentall positions that many in his inner circle oppose.

 If hes convinced hes making the right decision, he wont back down, said Karen Hinton, a former press secretary to Mr. de Blasio who left the administration in June. Depending on your perspective, its his best or worst quality.

 According to people close to him, Mr. de Blasio, 55 years old, often bristles when aides disagree with him, and some of them said they have never worked for a more stubborn person. Mr. de Blasio has told those close to him that they are giving him conventional wisdom or listening too much to his critics, these people said, and should instead focus on the mission, or what he calls his administrations work.

 Eric Phillips, who succeeded Ms. Hinton as press secretary, said Mr. de Blasio has a clear-eyed vision to improve the city.

 He wont compromise that mission by conforming to some outdated or past mayors concept of the job, Mr. Phillips said.

 Earlier this month, Mr. de Blasio called the New York Post a right-wing rag and a negative presence in our city and declined to answer questions from the news outlet. Some of his advisers have winced at the fight, saying they dont believe Mr. de Blasio benefits from attacking the newspaper.

 The mayor has told allies that print media is fading, social media is rising and that people will agree with his criticisms of the Post. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Post referred to the newspapers front page earlier this month depicting the mayor as a baby crying in a high chair. The Post and The Wall Street Journal are both owned by News Corp.

 In September, two media outlets sued the mayor over his administrations decision not to release emails between Mr. de Blasio and five advisers.

 People close to Mr. de Blasio have recommended releasing the emails, but the mayor has doubled down, with aides and lawyers huddling at Gracie Mansion earlier this month to discuss fighting the lawsuit.

 The mayors trip last winter to Iowa to campaign for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, even though he wasnt invited by Mrs. Clintons campaign, was widely opposed by his advisers. Many of the mayors allies disagreed with Mr. de Blasios 2015 decision to delay his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton for six months.

 Mr. de Blasio told his allies he wanted to push Mrs. Clinton to the left and he coveted a bigger voice on the national stage. He said this month he had no regrets, even as leaked emails from Mrs. Clintons campaign showed some of her aides were frustrated by the mayors actions.

 This year, the mayors aides mocked Mr. de Blasios proposed limits on horse carriages, according to emails reviewed by the Journal. Even after the proposal fell through, Mr. de Blasio told aides he wanted to try to revive it, drawing resistance from some of his staff.

 On many mornings, Mr. de Blasio travels from Gracie Mansion on Manhattans Upper East Side to a gym in Brooklyn, a 12-mile midmorning trip that has attracted protests and has become the subject of jokes around City Hall among people close to the mayor. Mr. de Blasio has said he has no plans to change his gym routine.

 Those close to Mr. de Blasio said the mayors governing approach is deeply rooted in his experience working for former Mayor David Dinkins in the 1990s and his own come-from-behind victory in the 2013 mayoral race.

 Mr. de Blasio believes Mr. Dinkins was unfairly attacked as a liberal Democrat. In 2013, as a candidate for mayor, Mr. de Blasio shunned all sorts of advice as he floundered early on in the polls during the primary.

 Bill Hyers, Mr. de Blasios 2013 campaign manager, said many people urged Mr. de Blasio to change course during the primary. But Mr. de Blasio stuck to his guns, stayed disciplined on the change and inequality message and ultimately won, Mr. Hyers said.

 To the dismay of some close to him, the mayor has said he isnt interested in attending events his predecessors have traditionally gone tosuch as parties in Manhattanif he doesnt believe they jibe with his ideological mission or if he disagrees with their corporate sponsors.

 Whether you like the mayors politics or not, said Mr. Phillips, the mayors spokesman, we think New Yorkers respect that hes not trying to be anything other than himself.

<TEXT> Most of the comments I *do* get is of "you're a shill!" variety, so I generally don't respond to most comments. Comments that contain questions, or just straight, clear-cut questions are a different story. I tend to find *those* interesting enough to respond to. 

And for the record, I think the term ***"pandering"*** is being overused ***way too much*** in this election. Seems to me "pandering" is being used as short-hand for "You're saying something I don't agree with, but in a way that might seem reasonable to others here. I don't like that, so you must be getting paid and/or are motivated by profit."

So for me, when these assertions do come up - and when I don't think the poster is open to reasonable dialogue - I don't bother all that often.

When I was new to Reddit, I made the mistake of being too responsive, which too often meant getting stuck arguing with trolls or earnestly paranoid redittors who weren't interested in changing any of their opinions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ... Is any of that supposed to evoke any type of thoughtful response from me?

Anyway, as you can probably see from my history, I do respond to comments fairly rarely, but that's either because most of the response I get are all along the lines of ***1)*** "You're a paid shill!", or ***2)*** "I agree with absolutely everything you say." Generally speaking, I don't respond to either of these two extremes. What I *do* respond to is something along the lines of "Well, I don't agree with this, but am curious why you believe this," or "Hey, that something new I didn't think of/I heard elsewhere. Tell me more.".

Simpy accusing others of holding opposing viewpoints because they are **paid to** is a very cheap ploy to shut down debate. And it no way encourages conversation.

Now, I don't know anything about you, but you seem to think I'm a Hillary shill. However, a combination of demographic probabilities and your username indicates to me that I'm probably to "the left" of you on more issues than you realize on the traditional American political spectrum. But then again, you also probably don't care about any of that since you already quite obviously made up an opinion of who I am based on a very filtered examination of my posting history.

<TEXT> While we both agree that Hillary is a much superior candidate to Trump - and I absolutely despise that con man - I think is is deeply important to separate our feelings towards him and Trump supporters. There is a subset of them who do not agree with his moral or ethical views, but see him as someone who can make the economic policymakers in Washington finally care about them and their concerns.

I do not think we should write this subset off, and I think there is a very real opportunity to reach them. But it is very, very important to not condescend to them - and more importantly, it is very necessary that we don't fit their image of detached elitists who look down on them and dismiss their way of life as backwards. That is definitely not how to start a conversation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You owe it to your fellow citizens who are most ideologically aligned with you to amplify their votes

The keyword above is ***amplify*** and if you agree that Stein would replicate her past electoral successes, there's very little possibility that you ensure the outcome that your friends' votes would be ***amplified*** in any meaningful or consequential way by refusing to vote for Clinton.

 Again you're back at it with this notion that voting for one candidate is actually voting for another.

Yes, because this is the outcome of any general election in this country.

  I would vote in favor of the policies I actually want, instead. If everyone did that, the two deeply unfavorable parties would lose every election.

If you agree that Trump is beating Clinton in the polls, that means the majority would prefer her over Trump. And no, it is not true that both are hated in equal numbers. If that were true, and if you simultaneously want to insist that Jill Stein still can win, we should be able to see shifts in support between Clinton and Stein such that they flip their electoral positions, or at the very least, she and Trump would flip electoral positions, which they are not. 

In other words, if we stick to ***realistic*** probabilistic calculations, even if we both agree that Stein would be able to switch electoral positions with Trump [which she has not so far], you'd have to agree that Clinton would ***still be doing better than Stein is***.

And this brings us to exactly where we are in chronological order:

1) Clinton
2) Trump
3) Johnson
4) Stein

If you insist that Stein is more popular the Clinton, Stein would have to move from position 4, pass Johnson, pass Trump, and then at least move within striking distance of Clinton. In other words, Stein would have to garner enough votes away from ***both** Trump ***and*** Johnson to even come ***close*** to Clinton's electoral position. 

And you cannot conclude that she's more popular than Clinton if she's losing to ***both*** Trump ***and*** Johnson. You cannot say that an electoral distance between number 1 and number 4 has nothing to do with policy preference. 

In other words, if you would agree that at least some of the difference between the electoral positions between Trump and Clinton have to do with policy preferences, it is likely that if you would agree that Trump is farther away from you on the political spectrum than Clinton is, it would be ***necessarily*** true that you would ***rather*** Clinton become President than Trump.

If you prefer ***Johnson*** to Clinton, that does not change the electoral positions, because Johnson would still be one electoral position ***above*** Stein, which is deceptive since we're not counting the large ***vote share*** Johnson is leading Stein with. So voting for Johnson still does not switch Johnson's electoral position with Clinton's, let alone invert their voting shares.

So, to go back to an argument based on the candidates' ***actual positions*** and assuming you're not so brazen as to write off the feelings of an entire sub-constituency, Clinton would still be beating Trump, and that ***necessitates*** her winning greater voter share than Stein. In [***no** current polls](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html#polls) is Stein beating Trump **or** Johnson. At the very least, if you were correct in your implication that Trump and Clinton are hated ***equally***, Stein should at least have ***more*** of a vote share to Johnson's and thus threaten the vote share of Trump's. But Stein is not doing that.

Like it or not, only one person can be President, and this means Stein would have to take ***both*** voting shares of Trump's ***and*** Johnson's to have a shot at beating out Clinton for the Presidency. 

Argue all you like, but electorally, whether Johnson and Trump's positions are inverted with Stein's Clinton is still winning. 

And in fact, if Stein ***were not*** in the race, Clinton would be winning by larger margins over Trump, because by probabilistic reasoning [assuming that Johnson would be the second choice for Stein supporters], Johnson would ***still*** not be beating Clinton even with Stein's cumulative share.

So, in other words, not only would your assertion that Trump and Clinton are equally hated to be ***reductive***, it also would more probably than not be ***offensive*** to a whole bunch of voters who actually like Clinton and/or her policies. (Look at the same collection of polls I linked to above).

I myself happen to like both Clinton and her policies, **beyond** any pragmatic consideration ***out of the candidates we have*** (I would have preferred Elizabeth Warren and I was heavily involved with a draft campaign for her before the primaries officially started). 

But, if you want to shift the conversation from ***electorally probabilistic arguments*** to arguments of ***policy***, I'd be more than happy to. Just know that it is generally the case that policy positions are more correlative with popularity/likeability and vote share/electoral positions. Which would mean that more voters ***like*** more of Clinton's policies than ***both*** Trump's ***and*** Johnson's. 

**Edit**: Now, I would like to continue this conversation, but that would have to wait until tomorrow or another time, since I am heading to sleep now and have work to do during the day tomorrow. So, goodnight, and if you want to continue this conversation, I'll see you on here tomorrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  1.) Candidates are entitled to our votes

I never said this, but this is largely correct in a way you don't seem to understand. You owe it to the citizens ***citizens*** who are most ideologically aligned with you to amplify their votes. By voting for the candidate who is by all current measures losing, you are **a)** not doing this,
 and
**b)** Voting for the next runner-up, which would in theory be for Johnson, but by all current measurements, his electoral performance will not by enough to win, which therefore means you'd only be denying the friends you most ideologically align with an amplified vote.

 2.) Jill Stein can never win

I wrote that if she replicates her previous electoral history, she can't win. MA, where she ran in, is very blue to deep blue, which I hope we can agree is closest to being hospitable territory for the Green and Democratic Party on the political spectrum than it is to the Republican Party. If you'd agree with this statement, you'd effectively be acknowledging that ***yes, assuming that she replicates her past performance, it's a very high likelihood that she loses in a purple or red state*** 

America is, in general terms, a ***"purple" country***. Therefore, if you agree that replicating her electoral history wouldn't be enough for her to win in a purple or red state or a purple **country**, your vote will be subsumed by the vote share of the next runner-up. And assuming that the next runner-up does not win, that vote share will be subsumed by Trump's.

Now, by drawing up a straw man by saying that I was saying that **candidates** are entitled to our votes, you win your own argument. But that's ***not*** what I was saying at all.

Those most closely ideologically-aligned to you deserve your vote in order to ***amplify theirs*** - or at least this should be true if you don't want the candidate that is totally opposite of your ideological stance to become President. So, I guess I would agree that ***candidates*** don't deserve your vote, but those most closely ideologically-aligned with you ***deserve*** to be ***empowered*** by your vote. 

It seems that you are assuming that I am assuming that our democracy is something that is up to the predilection of the ***individual***, which would be wrong. I believe, like our Founders of our republican democracy believed, that the function of the vote is to preserve the consensus of the community and to ensure the stable movement of the party system towards the next favorable consensus. And since Hillary Clinton is beating Trump for the top spot in the general election, I am assuming that the consensus of the majority of citizens is that they prefer Clinton to be their President and not Trump.

I'm assuming that those you most care about would rather this to happen. Or, if like you, they assume that neither Trump or Clinton would become President, they'd equally be as wrong in their calculations. 

So, if you want to maintain consistency, these two statements you made cannot equally be true:

 This is true, and sad. I don't want to vote "against" someone, I want to vote "for" someone. That's why I'm voting for the candidate that wants to dismantle the broken two-party system.

and this:

  So, my vote for Stein is a vote against Trump AND Hillary.

If you insist that you can somehow cobble these two outcomes together, you'd be saying that theoretically, you'd want ***no parties***, which is an impossibility in our current form of presidential democracy. Therefore, in this current system, you are constrained in supporting one of the major parties.

Now, explaining this does not mean I think the presidential system is the best. I personally would like a parliamentary democracy, which Bernie Sanders himself says is more hospitable territory for third or even fourth parties. But like Bernie Sanders said in his endorsement speech for Clinton, we sadly do not live in a political system that can sustain more than two leading parties.

In conclusion, instead of a protest vote, my suggestion is that perhaps a more preferable outcome is that you ensure that the candidate closer to your ideological position become President, and once that is ensured, you become active with an electoral or even party reform organization like [FairVote](http://www.fairvote.org/) or [The Center For Election Science](https://electology.org/), and ensure that the next President is the more likely one to be receptive to your political activism so you can push the system closer to a system that won't be constrained by two parties.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, so from the looks of your post, I think I might be a bit more familiar with the mechanics of presidential democracy than you are, in addition to being more familiar with electoral campaign history than you are.

In this system, a vote from third parties, while not always been outright a spoiler, has shaved off votes from either two of the major candidates (the **two** candidates leading in the polls).

Essentially, by voting for Stein, you are accomplishing **nothing** but denying votes for either of the two candidates. Essentially, you are tacitly giving your vote to one of the main party candidates.

So, let me rephrase your response:

In a two-party system, a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump **and** against the other candidates.

In a two-party system, a vote for Clinton is a vote for Clinton **and** against the other candidates.

A vote for Stein is for Stein *and* against the other candidates.
 
And assuming we can agree on **basic facts**, Hillary Clinton will either win or lose by slim margins. She is now leading, but that is among the voters already likely to vote. Which means, a vote for Trump **shaves** off her lead. 

Which brings me to my previous point: ** in all of her electoral campaign history, *nothing* indicates that a vote for Stein would assure a victory. You'd effectively be ensuring **nothing** except the possibility that Clinton would lose to Trump by a very slim margin.

Meaning, to reiterate, ***you'd in effect be giving your vote to Trump by voting for Stein***.

And, as you say, doing so would defeat your own purpose. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And so if you care about preventing Trump from becoming President, that's what you achieve by voting for Clinton. So admit it to yourself that you don't want Trump in the White House and vote Clinton.

The absence of "logic" is because Jill Stein is not being honest about the choices this election season with her supporters.

**That is my whole point.** You reiterated it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, if she doesn't win, and if Clinton doesn't win, Trump does. By voting for her, you are choosing Trump's victory over Hillary's. 

Fact is, she's being irresponsible by not clarifying that choice to her supporters, and by not being truthful of her actual electoral campaign history [and no, I would not define it a **"success"** as she has]. Bottom-line: **She has lied to her supporters out of omission**. And she does this, **while she insists that Hillary Clinton should not be able to do the same**.

Either she clarifies that choice for you, or she will continue being a tacit liar. Which would mean she's taking advantage of your earnestness.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since WSJ selectively uses paywalling, here is the full text:

 During October 2013, the month after lane closures at the George Washington Bridge choked Fort Lee, N.J. with five days of traffic, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie discussed the fallout from the closures, the governments star witness testified Tuesday.

 He testified that the two governors agreed that a report would be issued saying the lane closures were a traffic study, and the New Jersey side of the Port Authority would accept responsibility. Then, he testified, the New York head of the agency would sign off on it.

 My understanding at the time was that that would put an end of this issue, David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official, said in U.S. District Court in Newark.

 A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo attacked the testimony, saying the governor had played a positive role in the episode. It was our executive director who blew the whistle and ordered the bridge reopened. To be clear, no such conversation between the governors happened, in fact no report of any kind was ever done, and whatever the admitted bridgegate architect thought or dreamt about New Yorks involvement has no basis in fact.

 A spokesman for Mr. Christie had no immediate comment.

 The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the governors spoke privately in early December 2013, when Mr. Christie, a Republican, called Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, to express frustration that Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye had been pushing too hard to investigate the lane closures.

 Following that story, Mr. Cuomo, publicly backed Mr. Christies traffic study explanation for the closures, saying at a news conference that Im sure it is as Gov. Christie says it is. At the time, Mr. Foye, a Cuomo appointee, had already testified under oath that no such study existed.

 On Tuesday, attorney Michael Critchley, who represents defendant Bridget Kelly, continued his cross examination of Mr. Wildstein by focusing on the effort to contain the fallout from the closures, which he said ensnared high-level officials in the governors officebut not his client.

 Ms. Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are on trial for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to cause traffic jams in Fort Lee. N.J., to punish the boroughs Democratic mayor for not endorsing Mr. Christie, a Republican.

 Mr. Christie hasnt been charged with wrongdoing and has repeatedly denied knowledge of the lane closures before and while they occurred.

 During cross examination, Mr. Critchley portrayed the time after the lane closures as one in which high-level staffers in the governors office were trying to contain political fallout from the closures.

 Asked about the plan regarding the report, Mr. Wildstein said he understood that Mr. Foye, the Port Authoritys executive director, would sign off on it.

 You felt that Foye would sign it because you believed Albany had told Foye to, quote, lay off Christie, Mr. Critchley argued. Mr. Wildstein said that was his understanding, based upon conversations with David Samson, the Port Authoritys former chairman, and Mr. Baroni.

 Mr. Foye has said he wont comment during the trial, and a Port Authority spokesman declined to comment on the substance of Mr. Wildsteins testimony.

 Mr. Critchley also focused his questioning Tuesday on the preparation for Mr. Baronis November 2013 testimony defending the lane closure to a legislative committee in Trenton. During that testimony, Mr. Baroni said the closures were a traffic study. Mr. Wildstein has testified this was a cover story.

 According to Mr. Wildstein, those involved planning the report claiming there was a traffic study included aides to both Port Authority officials appointed by Mr. Christie and aides to Mr. Christie himself.

 Ms. Kelly had nothing to do with that report? Mr. Critchley, the defense attorney who represents Ms. Kelly, asked.

 No sir, she didnt, Mr. Wildstein said.

 One text message shown in court was from a policy adviser at the Port Authority at the time. Handed off the packet to Nicole a few minutes ago, read the text, which was sent on Nov. 25, 2013. The package, Mr. Wildstein said, referred to the report.

 The governors office said they didnt want any emails? the attorney asked.

 That was correct, Mr. Wildstein said.

<TEXT> Abstract: 

 Big data refers to the ability to gather large volumes of data, often from multiple sources, and with it produce new kinds of observations, measurements and predictions. Commercial applications of big data deserve ongoing scrutiny given the speed at which both the technology and business practices are evolving. One of the many questions raised by big data is whether companies will use the information they harvest to more effectively charge different prices to different customers, a practice that economists call price discrimination. Economics suggests that many forms of differential pricing, such as senior citizen discounts at the box office or tiered pricing for air travel, can be good for both businesses and consumers. However, the combination of differential pricing and big data raises concerns that some consumers can be made worse off, and have very little knowledge why. This report finds that many companies already use big data for targeted marketing, and some are experimenting with personalized pricing, though examples of personalized pricing remain fairly limited. While substantive concerns about differential pricing in the age of big data remain, many of them can be addressed by enforcing existing antidiscrimination, privacy, and consumer protection laws. In addition, providing consumers with increased transparency into how companies use and trade their data would promote more competition and better informed consumer choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope. In using the food/recipe analogy, it seems as if you were trying to dismiss the relevancy of this article based on an arguably misguided notion that Elon doesn't find climate change as urgent as other human needs that you see as interchangeable.

Yet, in acknowledging that your "point" was the irrelevance of your own food/recipe analogy, you acknowledged that climate change is an existential threat that Elon distinguishes in importance and urgency from "more mundane" existential threats.

Bottom-line, I don't think Elon would be comfortable with a President who advocates a hands-off approach to climate change. In saying that the government should not do anything about climate change because the sun will inevitably destroy the Earth one day, Gary Johnson offered a defeatist mindset that Musk himself explicitly and categorically rejected.

I quote Musk here: ***"If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.***

It is clear to me that Elon Musk would ***not*** be comfortable with Gary Johnson's myopic attitude toward an existential threat Musk clearly finds urgent, even if he finds that the odds are against a solution.

Now, if you personally support Johnson or his approach to climate change, that's your prerogative. But now that the overwhelming evidence and wealth of public statements by Musk suggests that he ***would strongly disagree with Johnson***. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, so you ***do*** know the difference between an actual argument and a straw man argument. ***Thank goodness***. Then that should mean you know that Tomasky never actually implied that Trump would intend for a supporter to murder someone.

Oh, and I do think you know what I meant up above. What you might think you're pointing out is the difference between stylistic rhetoric and logic. Above, you clearly demonstrated the capacity to know the difference. So I hope for your sake you're just playing the insufferable troll.

If you were truly engaging this so-called conversation honestly, ***clearly*** the "them" that you emphasized could interchangeably apply to ***BOTH*** Trump and the inciter [and ***incited***] to violence.  

Huh, interesting how you want to cut through someone's article without even reading the relevant section that explains the central point and still ignore when quoted for you, yet you quote me ***perfectly***.

In case you're lost here, you were played. 

PS: I you want a little pointer, replace "them" with "Trump" ***or*** "inciter," and you come to the same exact implication 

The President, as our Commander in Chief, is supposed to be a representative of our constitutional history, and an embodiment of our nation's authority. So you see, it doesn't matter if Trump is not his supporter. Trump uses his authority as presidential candidate when he incites violence at his rallies. What Tomasky is saying is that even if Trump does not explicitly call for someone's murder from the Oval Office [if elected], a shitload of crazy supporters will see that the nation elected this man, and think to themselves that by doing so, the nation gave them implicit permission to kill, hurt, and assault people Trump doesn't like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. People have murdered others, and cited Trump and things that he says as inspiration. 

2. When individuals murder in the name of "Islam", we generally don't elect them President and give them authority over an entire country's military. 

3. Learn how to read. Nowhere did Tomasky right that this needs to be intentional on the part of Trump. Tomasky simply wrote that Trump won't be careful with his words, say something stupid like he did about the "Second amendment people" thing he said before or that Hillary would be murdered without Secret Service protection, and someone would take him seriously enough to do it.

Since you don't seem to like to read what you disagree with, here you go:

 Maybe you dont care enough about Hillary Clintons life to be outraged about this. So think ahead to a Trump presidency. Hes capable of saying something similar about anyone who crosses hima liberal judge, a by-the-book bureaucrat, a left-wing academic, whatever. **And then suppose one of his followers actually takes him up on it.** Imagine explaining to your kids why the president of the United States incited a murder. And then imagine your kids asking if you voted for him, and you explaining that well, before the election, you just didnt see much difference between the two.

<TEXT> Last time I checked, the "hypothetical" Tomasky puts forward has actually come a lot closer to happening than yours. 

I urge you to look at how violent hate crimes have gone up since this election season, and look at how many of the perps cited Trump as inspiration. 

Now, if you have never heard of any of these incidents, that's not because they have not been happening - it's because you've not been paying attention. Just because you are protected in your bubble doesn't mean these things stop happening. You have the luxury of ignoring something others can't.

Quite frankly, you should be embarrassed using the "Lizard Overlord" and "Chtulu" "hypothetical". If you don't see a major difference between the first "hypothetical" and your own, you need to re-familiarize yourself with the difference between possibility and fiction. And then you might learn that "hypothetical" means something completely different than what you seem to think it does. </TEXT>

So, instead of working on building a coalition where they had a definite shot at an influence, the Communists decided to withdraw from electoral politics. For them, letting the system blow up was preferable than being a a member of a ruling coalition with Social Democrats.

MLK and LBJ formed a coalition, and they could not have done what they did if they kept only speaking to their bases. Both of them knew it, and both of them knew they needed the other to translate the other to expand both of their bases of support. Thinking that sustainable political revolution can come without a coalition is simply without historical precedent. 

I suggest you actually research the history of nonviolent revolution and research the strategies of nonviolent conflict. None of those strategies included subjecting an entire country to 50 years of right-wing/conservative jurisprudence [as you'd in effect be doing by allowing Trump to put two to three lifetime appointees on the Supreme Court).

So again, I say it's good to research candidates, but then ***you*** have to research ***history***. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you seem to be missing my point.

No matter how much you disagree with Clinton, or are disappointed in President Obama, you'd never hear them campaign on ideology tests, or xenophobia, or nativism, or the incitement of violence.

And so, that's also a ***huge*** difference for this very simple reason: ***racist assholes will see an avowed racist become president, and they will start thinking that you can be an open racist and still be successful in national politics***.

One case in point: David Duke, ex-KKK Grand Wizard, explicitly said that Trump's success on the campaign trail inspired him to get back into politics.

So, you see, the distinction ***is*** the point. Electing Trump means showing his racist supporters that it's OK to campaign openly on hate, fear, bigotry, and misogyny. By allowing Trump to be elected, you're in effect telling them ***"it's OK to be racist."*** You can add on "... as long as you're not a neoliberal corporatist" to that all you want, but you'll still be sending a very clear message that this country would rather have an open racist as president [who very explicitly said that lower-income communities of color should be policed even more] than a woman who I hope you admit at the ***very least*** would never think of using the campaign trail to incite hate crimes or transphobic violence.

I assume you are familiar with the importance of symbolism in politics since you refuse to vote for the Democrat in the race, so you must realize that this election is about more than policy. ***It's the culture and values we want to teach our kids and their generation to take into to their own future***. 

The Supreme Court has done more to shape our legal, social, and political culture than arguably any other institution in our country. I'm not willing to let Trump shape that for 50 years [at the very least].

So, you may rightfully say racism and hate have always been with us, but pointing out the distinction between Trump and his supporters is ***exactly*** my point: electing Trump will say to ***them*** that they don't hide their racism, or use the excuse of any extrajudicial for of justice,  etc. By electing Trump, you're telling entire communities that their prejudices are acceptable in our social, legal, and moral systems. You're telling entire transphobic states in the South that more of their businesses will be protected if they discriminate. You're telling police departments that police brutality can be justified because their President Trump [who you were OK with getting into office], said that "the problem" with police brutality in lower-income communities of color was because of ***under-policing*** and ***not enough harassment***. 

I'm unwilling to send that message to his supporters. There's a difference between institutional racism and out-and-out racism. The former is covered-up and hidden. It's concealed. And because of that, it can be exposed for its hypocrisy and fought, and can be dragged into the light to be publicly shamed. ***Out-and-out racism*** is when a candidate doesn't even ***hide*** the fact that he inspires anti-immigrant violence, only calling them ***'crimes of passion'***. there's not light to drag him into to publicly shame him. And that means his supporters won't be afraid either of any such publicity. On the contrary, they'll start thinking that racism should be openly celebrated.

That's when we go from situations like laughing at the insurgent Nazi Party as clowns to the collapse of the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you're voting for Stein? As I pointed out in the preface to my question, there is no evidence that your vote will help Stein in any way, shape, or form. On the contrary, there is pletny of evidence that a vote for Stein will undermine the progressive cause for at least 50 years by letting a conservative xenophobic nut-job name up to three Supreme Court justices.

And btw, in case you want a quick history lesson: the Supreme Court is primarily the cause of why we still have large pieces of FDR's New Deal and LBJ's Great Society, those having nothing to do with a protest vote or any kind of vote for a third party. </TEXT>

Saying your friends are not scared neither diminishes this reality nor does it mean my family will be safe from more anti-immigrant prejudice or even violence even more so than they already have. 

Electing a President teaches future generations what values are acceptable in this country. Electing anyone but Trump means the values he spews will never be legitimated by the seal of the President of the United States. I take it as a given that Hillary Clinton - whether I or my friends like her or not - will at the very least not legitimate the hate culture Trump has demonstrably inspired. </TEXT>

That includes children whose parents are at risk of being deported to a third-world, vastly underdeveloped country, where they cannot hope to have the same educational or career opportunities, and anywhere near the same standard of living of someone in a developed country.

All of them are scared shitless of a Trump presidency.

Before you ask, I will not specify which country or the nature of my family members' precarious immigration status. I think you can figure the rest out.

<TEXT> So, you're going to vote Jill Stein? After she lost her MA governor race - she came in third at 3.5% -, lost her 2004 State Senate run  for MA's 9th Middlesex District ( 59.6%-21.3%), lost the race for MA's Secretary of the Commonwealth after being nominated (she got 18% of the vote), and lost her second [2010] MA governor race with 1.4% of the vote?

The only official office she EVER won was Town Meeting Representative, in 2005 and 2008. And you think she can be President?

Throughout all of her runs - and still now - MA is reliably blue, meaning that MA would have been much easier for Jill Stein to win than an entire country where close to half of the voting population is Republican.

Now, the question is this: Do you actually care who our next President is? Do you care who is elected? And are you willing to gamble with your country's future?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) ***You*** brought up Chomsky to attack Clinton. So ***you*** made that relevant. 

2) President Obama has demonstrably made every effort to keep many of his promises. And he [did](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8849925/obama-obamacare-history-presidents) where he [could](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/obama-biggest-achievements-213487?paginate=false). It is also fact that he's scaled-back our military in the Middle East to the lowest levels since that start of the Iraq War [***that was under Bush btw***], and by all accounts, he has been [relentlessly pursuing that policy where he can](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/)

3) Assuming that you are a progressive or identify as an activist on the left-wing of the political spectrum, I find it utterly laughable that you don't know how our own government takes action. Our presidential democracy was not set up as a monarchy or a dictatorship - Presidents need to be constantly pushed and held accountable - yet it is ***fact*** that for the last several decades, we have seen a pitiful decline in voter turnout all across the American political spectrum. And a lot of that decline is coming from the segment of voters who happen to be the most anti-war and pro-peace. While turnout among these voters declined, we see a consequent upsurge of support for right-wing pro-war congressional candidates and politicians all across this country, including in the Republican takeover of Congress in 2010. Do you think President Obama - as President of the USA not just of the progressive antiwar left - could have somehow ignored the people ***who actually vote*** and magically divine the wishes and desires of the silent antiwar left who apparently doesn't care enough about voting out pro-war Republicans just because they feel that their government betrayed them on student loans?! Tell me again who puts America first and screw the rest?
 
It's funny how you accuse those who support President Obama of not caring about any non-American life. Yet - and I'm assuming you are among those who supported Sanders - only ***one*** of the Democratic candidates ***constantly*** spoke out against immigration and free trade deals in the most [appallingly nativist](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11139718/bernie-sanders-trade-global-poverty) and [sectarian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-k6qOfXz0) ways, even to the point of [embracing the insidious xenophobia of Lou Dobbs on Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38M9vfg4TPE).

And you call **us** lazy? You didn't even bother to think about what Sanders ***himself*** was saying as to why he always offered blatantly nativist comments regarding his stances on immigration and free trade.

Go ahead, prove me wrong. Actually look at the links I put here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tom Perez would be an amazing pick.

He's not only super-qualified, but can kneecap Trump on his 'whites-only' "law and order" image. Perez going down to Florida to meet with Trayvon Martin's family when he headed DOJ's investigation, getting a police chief fired for failing his duties, would be a powerful story when anxieties over police brutality and extrajudicial vigilantism are still fresh.

On top of bringing down Joe Arpaio under [Bill] Clinton's Crime Bill and the CRA, and then fighting Voter ID in SC and Texas?
That would be the end of Trump.

And it would be a hugely important symbolic victory to retake "law and order" from a blandly white ticket headed by a [suspected] racist.

A Perez pick would not only cement the bridge between Obama and the ticket and the future admin, but can remind everyone that being tough on law and order issues can also mean being pro-labor and pro-civil rights, and being strongly for immigration. Would be a an incredibly important story to tell.

Picking him would also have the added bonus of tying gun violence to issues of racial justice and police brutality.

And it would be a stunningly powerful image to see Tom Perez and Sybrina Fulton (mother of Trayvon Martin) on the stage together at the DNC. Would send us all a very important wake up call to carry into future generations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will be waiting to see which lower-income or below-poverty POC community she moves to. She'd probably change her tune really fast living in a lower-income minority-majority community by the end of Trump's firs term.

Honestly, this kind of statement is ridiculously irresponsible - and I say this because 

***A)*** She knows she would rather not be a POC in a minority-majority lower-income neighborhood for four years under Trump, let alone eight, 

***B)*** She grew up in a household more affluent than the average American [even likely adjusting for inflation over time),

***D)*** She pulled in a physician's income that was probably higher than most Americans for most of her adult life.

There's just ***so*** much wrong with this statement. I am stunned by the intellectual laziness it represents. Maybe she knows better though, which makes it infinitely worse.

I'm just embarrassed I ever thought that she was ***"the serious one"*** in this election. Historically-insensitive and careless statements like this made me defect big-time to Hillary [just putting all my cards on the table lest I'm called biased]. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, I've been quite consistent in this thread regarding the principles of anarcho-capitalism. That doesn't seem to support your idea that I "shift[ed] the conversation". 

And I did not argue that you shouldn't post here - I merely stated that you may have mistaken this subreddit for something else. 

Now, I'm under the impression that you might just be mistaking trollish personal attacks with political debate or civil conversation. Notice how I didn't attack you nearly as frequently or as viciously as you attacked me? That's because I believe in free, open conversation - and free and open conversation shouldn't involve any sort of bullying.

Now, if you don't believe in civil conversation, I have to conclude that you don't believe in engaging anyone on the basis of self-awareness or intellectual humility and an openness to others' differing views.

In which case, I will not be interested in continuing any conversation with you.

That's not any form of dishonest "shift" or underhanded manipulative ploy - that's just a sign that I'm interested in mature, more substantive, and less shrill political conversations. 

For future reference, personal attacks don't equal fully-formed political opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [He co-sponsored in an amendment to an immigration reform bill](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/109th-congress/house-amendment/971) that protected the anti-immigrant Minuteman militia from any form of accountability, such as delivering Miranda rights or any other form of due process.

He has [consistently spoken out against the anarcho-capitalist ideas of open borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-k6qOfXz0)

People in this country - especially on the self-identified "Progressive Left" - forget that the example of a "political revolution" they hold so dear - essentially [was made possible only through an ethnic statist compromise](http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/when-affirmative-action-was-white}. FDR still had out-and-out xenophobes in his party leftover from past electoral realignments, and he couldn't pass most if not all of his central New Deal programs without them. So, he had to make concessions to the cultural populists on ***both*** sides of the aisle [after he realized he was politically-outnumbered](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575532371905049074). 

One supporter of Bernie or Bust also gave me the example of LBJ''s Great Society as an example of a successful political revolution. Unfortunately, such a claim reveals historical ignorance as well [assuming that Bernie's supporters do not want ethnic statism]. One of LBJ's closest aides wrote a memoir reflecting on the administration's [failure to upend entrenched ethnic statism in his own party](http://sites.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/tag/harry-mcpherson/). In his book on post-Civil Rights regulatory agencies, Hanes Walton [documents how these agencies enforcement and compliance capabilities were utterly laughable](http://www.sunypress.edu/p-893-when-the-marching-stopped.aspx). 

Walton doesn't go on to make these speculations, but I believe this effectively buffered the institutionalized ethnic statism of the Democratic Party - and I think this very same ethnic statism leads to the predominantly white supporters of Bernie Or Bust throwing temper tantrums that the economy is "rigged" against them, while an increasing amount of [polls] (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-blacks-and-hispanics-the-economic-glass-is-still-half-full/) show a [more positive economic outlook among communities of color](http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/06/08/latinos-increasingly-confident-in-personal-finances-see-better-economic-times-ahead/) as we come out of the last recession.

I don't believe this is an historical coincidence. I believe Bernie Sanders was able to tap into the anxieties and resentments of white kids who see that their white parents were able to benefit from an [unidentified] white statism, while POC communities who are unfortunately on aggregate used to getting a smaller piece of the economic pie are "more optimistic" because they are seeing that their kids and grand-kids have more opportunities too rise up the economic ladder than they did, and these younger generations in POC communities are told this through family stories or shown this by the wealth or income gaps between them and their parent and grandparents.

Bernie's supporters are used to benefiting from the racialized economic rents of the New Deal, or at least used to seeing their parents and grandparents benefit from these institutionalized rents.

So, in summation, both Bernie and his supporters remember a closed-border white statist utopia where they didn't have to compete on the free/open market with as many skilled immigrants, and getting back to that is their idea of revolution. 

Even if they don't identify the goal as ethnic statism, it is. They just might not recognize that that is what they want, but that doesn't change the fact that Bernie's appeal is based on statist disenfranchisement.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  German ideology within the EU is internal devaluation and austerity position which has had the effect of being pro cyclical. Though that did not stop them from deception to meet Eurozone convergence criteria in the 90's.
 From a draft of Bill Mitchell's EU dysopia book (probably best to get the book as it will either give you all the answers for the paper or rich sources of information to pursue): http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=27968
 Here is a blog post exploring the 'deficit hawk' vs 'deficit dove' approach to budgets which would be important when discussing the magnitude of a pro/counter cyclical policy: http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=22542
 Mitchell wrote about the EU automatic stabilizers were not enough to be an effective tool for proper counter cyclical policy to be effective. In short budgets had to spend more. http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=27406 "Alexander Italianer and Jean Pisani-Ferry (1992) claimed that the new EMU would not need a large federal budget because sufficient stabilisation (via automatic stabilisers) would be forthcoming at the national level." http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=27418
 The price stability German ideology is derived in part from their fear of the hyperinflation in the weimar republic years. http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=27974
 Also look at Robert Barro's theory to understand why German policy makers would see austerity as anti-cyclical in some way. http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=8252

I assume that your identity is important to you. For example, if you are a straight male, I think it's safe to assume you'd get tired pretty quickly of constantly being referred to as a female or in feminine terms. Or if you are proud to be an American, I don't think you'd take too kindly to constantly being referred to as something not American or even being called un-American.

<TEXT> I don't know what "imo" means.

I'm of course of the opinion that this can raise important issues. Particularly with the speculation going around now that Corbyn didn't really give the "Remain" campaign his best effort because of his euroscepticism, I believe it's important for people to realize that calling oneself a progressive champion of labor does not automatically mean that they are pro-immigration. 

Oftentimes, people unfortunately conflate the economic left with a cultural left, and assume that an "enlightened" economic leftist is "enlightened" when it comes to issues of culture, immigration, or cosmopolitanism as well.

Particularly in parliamentary democracies the world over, this should never be assumed by voters. And judging from this video, voters in presidential democracies shouldn't assume so either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a very minimal grasp on what ESOPs are (Employee Owned Stock Plans), but I'm having a hard time seeing how ESOPs are different from other retirement plans or 401(k)s.

San anyone help me understand ESOPs, and its benefits, advantages, or disadvantages? 

Supporters of ESOPs say they're better than other retirement plans for both the company and the employee, but the most advantage to an employee that I could ascertain is that ESOPs can borrow money. 

So, I guess my initial questions are:

1) What is an ESOP?

2) Why/How are they unique?

3) Are ESOPs more advantageous than other employee benefit plans, and how?

4) Specifically, what is the difference between an ESOP and 401(k), and which is "Better" [for both employers and employees]?

Thanks to anyone will to educate me!! </TEXT>

I sent Norman a message asking him if he could write a general principles book on MMT investing, but he was not receptive to the idea at all [it's hard to figure out through electronic communication, but it might have been with a little hostility]. 

Instead, he kept on insisting I sign up for his 30-day free trial [with the catch, of course, that you have to physically cancel it before it automatically starts charging your card]. </TEXT>

As I read the comments from what I assume are supporters of Senator Sanders' and/or the "Bernie Or Bust" movement, has support for Senator Sanders himself always been an animating factor in the movement, or just a resentment directed towards Hillary Clinton and "party elites"?

I guess what I'm confused by is this: If Bernie is given input in a leading role formulating policy decisions for the next President, is the continuing to refuse to support Clinton really genuinely pro-Sanders to begin with? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Bernie or Bust" is deeply self-defeatist. 

If we look at electoral history and the history of GOTV strategy, both Parties move to where voters are. They shift their efforts to where they can find voters. 

In other words, "Bernie or Bust," by not voting in the presidential election if Hillary is the nominee, is not where the voters are because they would ensure that they themselves are not counted among the people most engaged and who vote.

Put more simply, "Bernie or Bust" would only ensure that progressive leaders like Bernie are made even more irrelevant and marginal to the DNC's electoral, political, and GOTV strategies..

This outcome wouldn't simply be because the DNC is somehow being nefarious; Bernie supporters who don't vote will just be making themselves invisible to the Party and the political establishment. The DNC won't know where to look for those voters in the next election cycle, and they wouldn't know how to engage that crowd.

Also, according to exit polls so far in local races, there is a statistically-significant correlation between Sanders voters and nonvoters in state and local elections. If the "Bernie or Bust" crowd truly want a political revolution, the answer is not to sit out of the election - it is to vote in ALL races no matter how insignificant they seem to be. If the more Sanders supporters elect pro-Sanders candidates to Congress and other local offices, Hillary and/or other center-left Democrats can be given a chance to move left without becoming politically and electorally vulnerable. 

Thus, Sanders' "revolution" would have a better shot at succeeding in the election booth rather than not voting in protest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might want to check out Nootropics Depot. I am also relatively new to the noot world, but ever since my intro to this world, I have become very fond of ND. http://nootropicsdepot.com/

My stack largely is oriented towards improving abstract and visual-spatial reasoning, so this list might help.

Adrafinil, Aniracetam, Caffeine + L-Theanine, Centrophenoxine, Oxiracetam, Noopept, Phenylpiracetam, and Teacrine.

However, what I would call my "base stack" does not include the Caffeine + L-Theanine or the Teacrine. I've added those more recently after the others, but don't know yet if I'll keep them in my stack. 

In my understanding, those two noots are the more naturalistic noots in my stack, and so a lot of the newer members of the noot community decide to start with those and gradually work up towards the more synthetic/experimental/investigational noots. Some, like a few friends of mine, opt to stay with these kinds of noots, citing some concerns over perceived risk. 

I personally don't mind any of the risk factors [I haven't encountered any noticeable issues], but if you also share these concerns, I think you might want to start out gradually with the natural noots first. 

Even though I don't think there is any base for concern around taking the more synthetic noots, you are theoretically more liable to **psych yourself out** and have a negative **placebo** effects. So, if you are currently in this head-space, I'd suggest **starting off slow** so you don't trick your own brain/mind into magnifying any bad side-effects. The placebo effect, as you know, can be **incredibly powerful**, so even if there is **absolutely nothing** there, the expectation that something bad will happen **itself** will bias your experience.

This is most of the stack I am currently using, and Nootropics Depot is a great place to get these from. They have really awesome customer service as well, so you can totally ask them for any other pointers or suggestions.

Also, Ceretropic is also a great place too: http://ceretropic.com/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a joint presentation by two leading economists examining a common error that many of our economy's observers and political commentators make: the government spending is somehow the same thing as household spending. 

This false equivalency is repeated quite frequently, often having very distorting effects on socioeconomic and sociopolitical discourse in this country. http://www.modernmoneynetwork.org/?q=symposia/governments-are-not-households

This seminar will examine the legal and institutional structure of the current global monetary system, with a particular emphasis on the economic freedoms afforded to nations such as the U.S., U.K., Japan, Canada and Australia that use a non-convertible fiat currency with a floating exchange rate. Questions to be addressed include:

How does a fiat currency with a floating exchange rate differ from other types of currencies?

How does government spending and taxation work?

Why is accounting important for understanding the economy?

How can monetarily sovereign nations address their current economic problems?  </TEXT>

Bill Clinton clarified:

"When Republicans controlled the White House, their trickle-down approach drove our economy to the brink of a collapse. After President Obama was elected, Republicans made it their number one goal to block him at every turn, spokesman Angel Urena said in a statement. That unprecedented obstruction these last eight years is their legacy, and the American people should reject it by electing Hillary Clinton to build on President Obamas success so we can all grow and succeed together.

<TEXT> This paper is a fascinating reappraisal of stress and anxiety. 

Essentially, the study concluded that people who associate stress with something bad had worse health outcomes [physiological, neurological, and psychological] than people who considered stress as a helpful indicator that a behavior or activity will result in negative consequences.

In other words, participants who view stress as a "friend" who politely suggests to them that they do something different or to avoid something bad is more likely to have healthier outcomes than participants who saw stress itself as something bad and something to avoid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This paper is very interesting. To paraphrase, the study observes that having a dense, intimate social network in which close, face-to-face contact is frequent, this reduces both stress and the risks of premature mortality. 

The study also concludes that if the act of giving, altruism, or mutual support are frequent themes in such intimate relationships, this also reduces stress and the risk of premature mortality to a notable degree.

The authors conclude with policy proposals of encouraging communal mutual support and one-on-one supportive and mentoring relationships.

I should note that by 'intimacy', I do not only mean it in a romantic or sexual context. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And I would reply to that, as I did in my previous response, that voting 'when necessary' to influence elections (I take this to means you don't vote when you don't think it's necessary and/or your ideals are not under threat) can - according to most of political history - be misguided. 

Parties need to constantly hear from their voters to know if the direction they are going in is the voters' direction. If they don't constantly hear from certain demos of voters, they start looking for other demos who vote more reliably and consistently.

Conversely, back to your initial idea that the youth vote lost faith with the DNC due to unpalatable policy shifts and the absence of voter outreach, too many voters only vote due to perceived necessity in presidential elections to a significantly greater degree than in local and state elections. 

Unfortunately, too many voters [you're likely not included] seems to have forgotten their civics and their Constitution, particularly the Separation of Powers. 

If voters vote only due to necessity, *Congress* [and probably the *Presidency*] will only act out of necessity - their behavior in other words will reflect what their voters want and what they view necessary. Congress only sees issues as necessary if voters see them as necessary - that's how popular representation, Congressional behavior, and executive (Presidential) behavior works.

If voters don't see the need to consistently vote or support a party's agenda because they perceive that their ideals are sufficiently entrenched in the Party and their ideology is not under threat, the Party will inevitably decide to look where they get more consistent, reliable voter feedback. 

Example: lots of Democratic voters loved Obamacare when it was introduced and a few months in, but voters became complacent and stopped seeing a need to sustain these policy changes. The 2010 and 2014 elections are two of the more recent examples of this. 

Three underlying assumptions that voters who vote only due to "necessity" seem to take as givens: 
1. Political parties are monolithic, 
2. Because of this, Parties have a monopoly over policy decisions/policy agendas.
3. Thus, once voters help secure an agenda, politicians have a mandate that is effective until he or she gets out of office. 

Two really good articles that examine what I am trying to tell you are these: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-incites-his-crowds-and-his-crowds-incite-him/

<TEXT> Unfortunately, voting only for "necessity" is not enough to induce either Party to mobilize voters in your demographics or geographical area.

I've long had a semi-beef with fellow progressives on this very issue. For example, many Sanders supporters say they won't support Clinton if she is the nominee. 

Their arguments largely are to the effect that letting the GOP nominee win will convince the DNC to start supporting candidates more progressive than Clinton in future election cycles.

As a long-time political observer and as a political scientist and historian, this is a glaring mistake in political and electoral causation.

Political parties move to where **voters are**. Conversely, where there are no voters, **there is no Party**. 

Generally, it is an assumption that smart electoral practice demands that parties go where the voters are, because otherwise, they are wasting their own time and their bases' time. And if Parties waste their bases' time, Parties risk losing the voters they have. And those voters that the Democratic Party will be worried about losing won't be progressives as long as they don't vote.

Political parties allocate more delegates and superdelegates to high-turnout states. In this case, if voter turnout is depressed in blue states relative to purple or even red states, delegates are allocated to where more viable (i.e., more conservative or centrist) Democrats are.

In fact, one of the reasons the delegate and superdelegate system was created was to ensure that if depressed voter turnout is low enough to allow a totally unpopular or unelectable or destructive candidate to win due to miserable turnout numbers [i.e., Trump], the delegates would step in to offset the low voter turnout.

In the Bernie vs. Hillary example, if his supporters *don't* vote for a Democratic nominee who is decidedly **not** the most conservative Democrat ideologically, not only will the DNC look for someone more conservative than Hillary to support, but Sanders' own supporters will have misguidedly caused figures similar to Bernie irrelevant and marginal to the Party's electoral calculus. 

Political parties - particularly the DNC - are more responsive to voters than many people seem to realize. And one of the larger ways they are able to "read" the electorate and the country's mood is through voter turnout. Thus, if only conservative or moderate Democrats vote, and progressives don not, parties have no choice but to listen to the conservative/moderate Democrat vote. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but since your alternative perspective relies on falsifiable reductionism, it is for the most part invalid.

Your assumptions rephrased: 

1) The youth vote was vibrant and strong enough to influence elections in meaningful ways.

2) The DNC drifted away ideologically from the electorate, thus disenchanting the youth voter.

3) The absence of the Democratic youth vote hurts the Democrats in meaningful, fundamental ways.

4) The depression of the youth vote is the Democratic Party's own fault. </TEXT>
