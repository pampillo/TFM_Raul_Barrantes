<TEXT> I worked in a pet shop where the owners were Eileen and Ryan. They owned an African Grey that they had in the shop and also when they went home at night they took it. This bird learned one telephone noise and apparently I learned that these peoples relationship was way one-sided. All I heard when it was in the shop was "I love you Ryan" or the phone. I would have strangled this bird given the chance.  </TEXT>

This was the first time I had ever been in Georgia, let alone the first time that I had been out of my home state for sure. There was a tropical storm that was battering down on Georgia at the time, not enough to be a hurricane, but close. Regardless, I was soaked on the side of the road. There was this one car that stopped and instead of being creepy or anything dangerous at all, she throws open her trunk and pulls out a giant umbrella and just gives it to me. One could not tell wether my face was wet from rain or tears of joy but it made me so happy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I made a small batch of caramel sauce and then added about a third to a batch of frosting. I put that in between the two cake layers and sort of just put about 1/2 and inch on top of the cake. Then I took a bunch more of the caramel and just poured it on top. Then just swirl away. I had a lot of the caramel left over so I'm not too sure how much I used for that. However swirly you want to make it I guess. Have fun!  </TEXT>

The cream cheese frosting was 4 cups cream cheese, 1 cup butter blended together with 3 cups powdered sugar.

<TEXT> I've stated this before on situations like this as a worst-case-scenario kind of thing when all the money is gone with no directions. Go to coolworks.com and often you can get a basic job such as a bellman or housekeeper if you don't have any skills whatsoever but often if you can pay to get to the job which are scattered throughout the country, they will support you with food and housing until you start making money and then rent is usually dirt cheap as well as the food being just as cheap. It's a great option to get a savings going and get back on your feet, even temporarily. </TEXT>

Generally they will be in the closet supplies(hangers, shoe racks, clothes baskets etc). Super cheap and all you have to do is put them in a bucket of some sort and leave them in the car. They pull all the moisture out of wherever you put them. My car was recently moldy on the inside and needed this as part of the solution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my third grade class, my teacher was so into sign language that she "forced" it on us. Some days just to show us how hard it is for some, we weren't allowed to talk and could only sign. I really wish I would have kept more of that knowledge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also if you are feeling extra adventurous and want to save all that money that you have, check out the seasonal life of working in the national parks. It changed my life and whenever I think that I'm at a low point or near there, I know that they provide modest housing and will help feed me until the first paycheck with them. The website is called coolworks.com and it's totally worth looking into, especially somebody so young still. Good luck! </TEXT>
