<TITLE> A touch of love. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> She was so beautiful. My love, my life. 
Laying in front of me, peaceful and still. 
I touched her bare skin gently with my finger tips, she stirred only slightly. A small gasp escaping from her lips, red and full under the light of the moon.

It was a warm night here, my lover was wearing nothing and I only a shirt. There was a slight breeze blowing across us, through the trees and kissing our skin. I could almost trace its path, just by watching the goosebumps rise across the pale skin of my partner. 
Our naked forms were sprawled across the soft grass between trees, we had both needed a rest from tonight's activities. I wasn't worried about our privacy, my land was large and secluded far from prying eyes.

I felt rested, and although still wrapped in a haze of sweat and adrenaline, I wanted more. I was beginning to feel the familiar electricity of excitement inside of me, and I couldn't help but gaze downwards and admire the prone form of my companion. Her breathing was calm and her eyes closed, no doubt dreaming about some other peaceful place. 

I traced small circles across her stomach with my fingers, watching the shadows dance across her belly. I loved watching her breathe, her ample chest rising and falling with each small panting breath. Her stomach quivering in turn, she was starting to stir and awaken to my touch more fully.

I was eager to rush, but I knew that I mustn't. I licked my lips, and moved my hands across her hips. I loved every curve on this woman, truly I was lucky to catch such a prize. Other women had passed through my life so quickly, fleeting and brief. The woman before me had already outlasted all of the others, she was a true fighter. 

I pulled myself into an awkward kneeling position and adjusted my shirt. My love was still slowly coming too, so I placed my hands back onto her body. With one hand on each side of her waist, I pulled her closer to me, bending her knees upwards so that I was kneeling between her toned legs. Her arms remained stretched out above her head, she looked so peaceful. 

The view I had was incredible, and I could tell that she was just as ready for round two as I was. 

I leaned forward, over her body, And planted a kiss firmly onto her lips. A small sigh escaped from her mouth and I couldn't hold back. I propped myself above my lover on one arm, and used my free hand to caress her firm breasts. Hearing her moans was exciting me more and more, each breath felt like a whisper right into my soul. Urging me forward, pushing me on.

My hand travelled lower and lower, tracing invisible pathways downwards. Until I reached it, the warm and inviting source of my arousal. I could feel the warmth, and I was more than eager to explore further. 

I lightly traced my fingers around the edges, i tapped and I tickled feeling the wetness of her body. My fingers were coated in her already. My lovers eyes were open now, half lidded and blue like balls of glass.

I heard a small whisper, I paused to listen again. 

"Please"

A please? I knew she wanted me, and this. I paused, and then decided to give her what she desperately needed. I plunged a finger deep inside of her, causing her to violently shudder and then I quickly added one more. I was staring right into her eyes as they flew open, I saw the pain on her face as she started to scream.

The thin slit across her stomach was my own handiwork, just big enough for my delicate hands. I removed my fingers from the warm and wet wound, and lifted my fingers to my mouth. 

I dripped the taste of hot iron across my tongue, and laughed as my lover tried to struggle free of her bonds. I removed my blood stained shirt and wiped drops of blood from my breasts. Her eyes weren't quite so glassy now, which means she still has some fight left.

It was time to tie up my hair and call for my husband. We were both ready for him, although only one of us beautiful ladies would be able to walk away from tonights experience.

"Shall we have some real fun now my love?".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It honestly sounds like he killed himself, and his last thoughts were incorrectly focused onto you. He passed away so full of anger that his spirit is going to try and take your life. Each year he will get closer to you, and closer to achieving that goal. I'd seek out a medium / psychic etc to try and help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is so weird, you're a murderer but you refer to it as a profession. But you aren't a hit man.

You want to save the girl, in order to kill her. 

You want to remove murder enablers, but you are a murderer.

You hang out with other murderers, to get info but you can't trust them and they are somehow worse people than you. If you can't trust them, why would they give you any good info? 

You're super smart at noticing cops, details etc. But you make odd, seemingly silly choices like walking around with a missing girls dog, sitting near undercover cops while talking about murder and then drawing attention by threatening your 'mate'.

It's like you can't decide where you want this tale to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are literally two outcomes to this...

A) Rita is killing teenaged boys as a sick justice for her brother dying (or maybe she killed her brother as well) and the teeth are a memento. She works late because she still has ten boys alive somewhere. In this case your brother is next, and you and papa are both in danger. 

B) your dad killed these boys and hid the folder. This means that Rita has finally tracked down the murderer and that's why she is so weird and cold towards you. 

Either way, you need to call the police right now. Not calling the police is the dumbest thing ever, you are potentially putting your own life at risk and a potential murderer is getting the chance to keep that evidence hidden.

Please engage your brain, there is no good reason not to call the police. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does sound an awful lot like there were experiments being conducted underground, what with all of the locked doors. Although, it could have been that the blast opened up a passageway into the home of these creatures.. Being that this wasn't strictly nazi territory at the time the experiments would have started. (I don't think, forgive me history lessons were many years ago).

The latter kind of makes more sense, on account of the soldier thinking it was just a standard bunker to hide inside.

What you're feeling isn't normal, it's depression most likely or something related. Falling in love, and being so encompassed by the feeling, to the point of obsession isn't normal either and is probably related. I strongly suggest seeing a doctor, getting medication and / or therapy. It can really help.

That's why I'm thinking that it was just a trick of the light, and she got swapped. With alternate dimensions, there must be easier ways to get unborn children's souls.

And, he took the unborn child didn't he? I wouldn't have thought that he would then give it back. But who knows. </TEXT>

The 40's wasn't a great time to be a mental patient but we did learn a lot from that era. Electric shock therapy and trepanning (drilling of the skull) is still in use today, but obviously more regulated. 
I don't want to be mean, but your intro made it a bit hard to feel bad for you.. Because you don't seem very caring about the sick people you work around. Maybe it's just the way I've read it though.

<TITLE> One light bulb </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-13 02:16:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As a child I often had strange thoughts, as I'm sure most children do. Having unusual thoughts floating through a childish mind isn't immediately unusual, and parents only show concern when a child becomes vocal about their weird flights of fancy. No one ever really asked me about my thoughts, and even if they did, some things are best left unsaid. Even as a child I knew that I probably shouldn't share some of my crazy thoughts.

It all began one day, when I was in the toilet. At the tender age of 6, I was minding my own business, my brain decided to ask me 'what if flushing the toilet too much, brings a monster to life?' 
Hmm. Then I was stuck, truly stuck, sitting on my porcelain throne. Should I flush the toilet? But what if not flushing the toilet will unleash this beast instead, what if it's just a trick? I remember crying, sitting bare bottomed over the dilemma that I had found myself in. I think my mum saved me, somehow. But every trip to the toilet since then was an inner torment, a grim reminder of the terror I felt that day. The fate of the world had seemingly rested in my chubby, 6 year old hands.

Over the years, other strange thoughts have come and gone. With some lingering longer than others, but always following the same theme. A singular action, carried out by me, ending the world or unleashing some terrible monstrosity upon mankind. Whether it be something small, like never knocking three times or less on a door. Would two knocks complete some ancient, yet unfinished ritual? In turn summoning a demon forth from hell, burning all of the world alive in its wake.
Or whether it be something ridiculous, like closing my eyes until the fluorescent lights finish blinking on in my office. If I have my eyes open, I might see into another dimension. Everyone knows that seeing something like that creates a pathway between the two dimensions, right? My brain was always providing me with these little instructions, it was always there to pester me with these warnings.

'Don't kick that plank, it's loose. It'll definitely cause a building collapse.'
'Don't look behind you three times, we are walking at night! Don't you remember that story? The one about raw head? I know it was fiction, but these things can happen!'
'Don't tap that wall, the ceiling will totally collapse. Might even cause an earth quake.'

The thoughts died down with age, which was so good. I couldn't stand always feeling so responsible, all the time. Having that weight on my shoulders was draining. I suppose that I also like the normalcy, most people don't think such weird things. I could have moved on, I could have just left it all behind. If not for the light bulb.

You see, I've lived in my home for 10 years now. I keep to myself, I don't know my neighbours but I see them now and again. My home is nice, it suits me fine and I'm happy here. Behind my home, there is a row of houses that directly mirrors my street. Our houses are separated by a dirt path and our mirrored back yards. Nice wooden fences; matching council house windows, hopefully you get the idea. Each on my street has a direct view to the back windows of the houses on the opposite street, and visa versa. Everyone was just close enough to see when people were home, but far enough away that you were fine if you liked to hoover naked. 

For ten years; the house behind me has been occupied by the same person, or people. I know that someone must live there! Lights in other rooms go on and off during the evenings, blinds go up and down in the windows. But, for ten years, that one light bulb has always been on. Always on, never covered, never hidden from view and never, ever off.
At first, I assumed that it was a bedroom, in the same place as mine. I too prefer the small comfort of the standard 'box' room, rather than the king sized room at the front of my house. It wouldn't be too unusual to assume that there was a child, or even an adult, using that room as a bedroom. Perhaps our schedules were just too different, and I missed the bulbs' off times. Besides, it was their electricity bill after all! What did I really care? 

After a long while, it became a curious fascination. How odd, for someone to leave a light bulb on for so long. How strange, that they don't even have curtains in that room.

Over time, it turned into something more than a fascination. I would look slyly out of my window now and again, just to see the bulb hanging from its wire. Doing nothing other than lighting up an empty room. Why was the room so bare? From my vantage point I could tell that the room was empty, no furniture, no curtains and not even a light shade for the poor lonely bulb. What was the point? It boggled me, truly. I often thought of the bulb, it seemed wasteful really. 

Years passed, and my obsession grew and grew. Sometimes I was angry, angry at that damn bulb. It was just there and I wanted to know why! I had never, ever seen a human in that house. The lights still alternated in the other rooms, as if people were living a life in that place. But I never saw any other signs of life there, the windows and doors remained closed. No sounds of children, pets or even the tv ever floated on the breeze over to my home. I never smelt freshly cut grass from the garden, yet the grass always seemed well trimmed.

The bulb was on, just on all the time. I realised that it must be there for a reason.

'It's to keep the dark away.' That's the logical reason, and I knew that my brain had been wrong before. All of the stupid obsessions I'd had before had been wrong, but this one just felt so right. I became the unofficial watcher of the bulb, it had to stay on. The darkness would swallow us whole should it ever go out. It can't go out, never has in 10 years. That was my motto, and I was the proudest member of my own little fan club. 

What does it really take to keep monsters away, to keep demons sealed in their realms and to keep evil away from our homes? Light! Light has kept us safe. None of the other things I've done before mattered, none of those childish games were the true saviour of us. The light bulb is! The the protector of the bulb! 

For the first time in 10 years, I saw the darkness. It took over my light, in the space of one blink. I knew that I had to save the light, I knew that I had to get that bulb back on before the world was swallowed whole by the inky darkness. I tried my best, and that why I'm here now underneath the shattered remains of our old protector. I'm here, huddled in the suffocating darkness and I can feel it inside of me. The darkness is killing me, I can feel the cold tendrils seeping into my skin and tearing me apart. But I don't regret trying, I don't regret jumping my fence and leaping into the creepy ever cut garden. I don't regret smashing into this strange house, with its sentient light switches. I don't regret slaughtering the demons that I found in here, pretending to be surprised at my entrance. Their bright red blood splashing onto me, as they screamed and gurgled in broken english. 
I regret cutting myself on the glass of the smashed back door, maybe I'd have been faster. Maybe, I could have gotten here quicker. I regret not being able to save the light. I regret not locking the door as another demon knocks, telling me to come out. It's calling to me in perfect english, telling me that it's 'the police'. What a joke, the world is ending and these demons still want to play games. I regret that the darkness won't kill me, before the demon does. </TEXT>

Maybe have them look after the baby for a few days, to bond, allow you rest and keep the baby safe.

I think possibly, it's more like a spirit of the sea or something. Those three men were the first in the lighthouse, and died as possibly an offering. No one has died since, but blood is required to keep the bad spirit happy? I don't know.

 Check lighthouse records for similar disappearances from original crews. 

Maybe you remember because you aren't actually a crew man? Or because the spirit knew that you were looking for him.

<TEXT> Murder can also be caused by negligence, undue care etc etc. It probably varies a lot all over the world, but if this was the uk he could be tried for murder (if he was older) because shooting at someone can reasonably be expected to result in the outcome of death, as well as injury depending on the outcome.

In this case, it was a pellet gun and he was ten. So I think, the devil used his knowledge to trick a good soul into ending up in hell. Because he ended up committing suicide, rather than dieting naturally and going to heaven. I wrote 2 comments and can't remember what I actually put lol. </TEXT>

The uncle probably didn't even know that the hobo died though.

Strangely though, Catholics preach that confession saves you from hell. So the fact that he killed himself, seems like he cared more about his reputation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's where the belief of the whole celebration comes from.

Either way, you should try the police again. Just tell them it's a missing persons report to investigate, don't tell them all the unusual stuff.. See what they find out.

I think the best bet would be to ride that bus, with a bag full of supplies and maps. Might take a while before it turns back up though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like she accidentally got a ride into the Mexican afterlife. 
There are two levels, where the good go if they are remembered by their living families and the place where the forgotten spirits go. If she went someone that was full of cheer and bright colours, then she is in the happy place. There are ways out, if I recall correctly. But I don't know that much in detail.

She can look for the ruler, a female goddess I believe. Who will help her, but unless you get on that bus too... There's nothing that you can really do from this side. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Silence. The unmistakeable, tangible and smothering absence of sound. True silence, not a single sound to be heard. There is a dark and stormy sky, the clouds are full and heavy. Rain is lashing down, being blown almost horizontal, by a strong wind. The kind of wind that should be howling through the skies, almost like an angry animal. But everything is silent. The huge clouds above are being whipped into a frenzy but the gale force wing, moving across the sky at a dizzying speed.
Lightening flashes in the sky, briefly illuminating my surroundings. This is when I realise where I am, and what I can see around me. I am seemingly floating, slightly above an endless plain. A dark green blanket of grass covers the ground for miles and miles in every direction, all laying perfectly flat and stretching further than I could ever see. It's like a green ocean, immeasurable in size. The grass below is waving and rippling with the force of the wind, and I can see patterns twisting in the grass as it is illuminated by the brief flashes of light in the heavens. 

The only break in the monotony of this view, comes in the form of a gigantic mountain. It is standing, directly in front of me. I am dwarfed by it size, a single spike of rock, jutting from the broken earth like a jagged tooth. It stretches high into the sky, a snow capped peak disappearing into the darkness above. It is night time, or perhaps this nightmarish land has no sun at all. I have no way of knowing, and even less desire to find out.

I can feel the silence now, pressing in on me, even though I have no form to speak of. My consciousness is here, whilst my body is sleeping elsewhere. Perhaps I am merely a visitor, here to observe this world and nothing more. There should be noise, cracks of thunder, bellowing wind... But there is nothing. This dream is silent, completely silent.

I'm floating here, invisible and nothing happens for an age. I know that I am dreaming, I am aware of that fact, but I have no control over what is happening before me. I am simply stranded watching a silent storm blowing through the grass below me. How long has it been? Dreams are short, but feel like hours. My mind feels like it's beginning to slip away, becoming confused as to where I am. This is a dream, I repeat this mantra hundreds of times. The words begin to sound foreign and strange to me. I have been stuck in this loops for so long.

After what feels like days, I see movement. I turn my head down towards the base of the mountain, i blink. In an instant I am lower, did I move? Or is this just a trick of my mind? This is a dream. I am positioned approximately 8 feet from the ground and I am level with something that I had not seen here before. Was it always here? Maybe not, this is a dream. It is a gaping tunnel, no, a pipe. The mouth of a pipe is sticking from the side of the mountain. It is dark and wet, like an endless hungry mouth. It smells of copper and Earth, water is flowing slowly from it. It looks like some kind of run off pipe, the kind that I've seen on tv, but not in real life. I really do not want to go into the tunnel, or any closer to it at all. It's wide mouth has filled me with fear, the darkness is looming in front of me. I can feel it there, waiting. This is a dream, I want to wake up. My mantra has changed, because I am terrified.

I divert my attention back to the movement that caused my to move here, anything to look away from that pipe. I can see an elderly couple walking slowly towards the mouth of the pipe. There is no easy path up the mountain, they seem to be struggling. They are holding hands, and have their heads bowed down in the rain. Their long khaki raincoats are billowing in the wind, and they look so tired. Their backs are bent in the force of the wind, I wish I could help them. I try to call out, but they cannot hear my voice. They cannot see me either, it becomes immediately clear that I am merely a spectator here. The man and the woman are heading to the tunnel, they seem determined. Why?

I am terrified, I am over come with fear and dread. I am cold. This is dream. Why would they enter the tunnel? Why? 

The first and only sound that I hear in this nightmare is a voice, it comes from the mountain. It does not echo from the tunnel; or whisper into my ear like a lovers secret, it just comes from the mountain. As if the mountain were a man, standing tall in front of me. The voice is male, deep and strong, the words are clear but not loud. 

"Watch them enter, watch them die."

That is all I hear, but I know that the voice is talking still. I know that it is telling the couple to enter the pipe, walk in. Walk right in. I am screaming to them, begging and pleading with them. "Don't go in, you'll die. You're going to die!" They can't hear me, nothing gets through. 
I know that it tells them to go deeper and deeper into the dark, turning them left and right inside of a pitch black labyrinth. Don't worry it says, I know the way. I'm still screaming, my throat feels like it's tearing apart, I'm crying out of pure desperation. I feel like I'm smashing my hands into a wall of glass, trying to break through into this nightmarish world. The voice tells me that I cannot save them. 

The tunnel mouth is gone now, but I know that the couple are trapped in the mountain. Walking in the dark forever, just waiting to die inside that awful coppery tunnel. I can feel their determination to reach the end of the tunnel. I can feel their love for each other. I can feel their fear, their pain and their uncertainty. Before I wake up, the last thing I feel is their cold acceptance. They know that they are going to die, lost, cold and alone. They will collapse, exhausted, onto the wet floor and slowly fall asleep. Hand in hand, and I feel it as they go cold.

"You will never save them. You don't remember." I try so hard to remember.

Every day when I awake, I am tired and sad. I feel lost.
A few days ago I sent my description of this dream off to some famous dream expert, I saw an advert on Stephen Kings Facebook page. Apparently he is about to release a new book about bad dreams, and his literal 'dream team' were taking requests for dream analysis. I thought it might be worth a try, maybe they will ease my worries. Maybe if I understand the dream, it won't be a scary.

The version I sent off was a lot more condensed, but it was still longer than the reply I received. I got a Facebook message that simply said "remember us". I freaked out a little over that, because I didn't think it was funny. I didn't hear anything else from the page.

Ever since, I've been finding those two words scribbled on my university notes, highlighted in newspapers, traced onto steamy bathroom mirrors... Never anything else, just "remember us".  What should I do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "For gods sake Anna, are you cleaning in there or just messing around?! I don't want to have to ask again!"

My mum has just started chewing me out about not cleaning the bath. It's become a frequent argument in this house, almost every single day there comes a shout from down the hall. 'Clean the bath' or 'why don't you wipe down after yourself?'; it's become part of the morning ritual.
The thing is, I always wipe down after a shower. I stand in the bathroom bundled in a towel; turn off the the shower and grab a new towel from the rack, to start the aggravating process of wiping away all of the water droplets from the ceramic tiles. It takes even longer these days as we had a new bath and shower fitted. Instead of a plastic shower curtain, we now have a big glass door hanging from the wall. I wipe it clean, and dry, every day so that there are no water marks or gross smears left behind.
Then, the damp towel gets hung up to dry. Simple enough. After this morning, after what I've seen, I'll never clean that room again. Hell, I'll never use this bath for as long as I live.

I suppose I should take a step back, and start from the beginning. A handful of months ago, our landlord paid us a visit to check out the place. He is a fairly absent guy, but he makes a habit of stopping over once a year to make sure his property is still standing. He lets us know when he is coming over and all in all he is a pretty decent landlord. We pay our rent, he sorts out any issues we have and that's pretty much it. We've lived here eight years now, and it's a pretty nice setup for me and my mum. Our house has been standing for 60 years, but it's in good shape.
Before all my problems started; we had noticed that our bath had been looking pretty dull, the enamel was worn and chipped. Our shower sputtered and the plastic coating was faded. Some of the white tiles on the wall were loose or cracked. I guess the bathroom tiles were pretty old at the time anyway, I mean, the cracks had been there since we moved in. Generally, you looked at the bathroom and just thought that it needed a nice coat of paint and some TLC. 
So when the landlord announced his annual visit, my mum made a plan to ask about getting a new shower and a can of paint. She didn't want to push her luck, so she was going to offer to do the painting herself. That's the kind of person that my mum is. We were both totally shocked when the landlord announced his plans to get a whole new bathroom refurbishment for us, a new bath, new tiles, new shower... Hell, he even said we could choose the colour scheme. 

Fast forward two months later, the workman are all gone and we have this awesome, shiny new bathroom. My mum picked out this beautiful Aqua colour scheme, white tiles and a crisp white sink unit. The first time I used the shower, I felt like I was in a 5 star hotel. The water came out with no false starts, no ridiculous temperature issues and best of all, there was a working extractor fan! I was pleased to finally not have to deal with damp towels. It was nice to have a new bath too, it was shiny and new. With big clawed feet, like I'd seen in posh magazines. I thought at the time that it was an odd choice, as I thought that would have been an expensive option. But what did I know about baths? 
For a few days, everything was perfect. Until my mum started yelling at me, "you're leaving hair in the bath!". At first, I simply thought that I was being forgetful. I'd walk back along the hall, pick up a towel and wipe down the bath. I'd polish the silver taps, clean the smears from the glass and pick out the odd strands of hair laying the the base of the bath.

I assumed that the hair was mine, as it was long and black. Just like my hair was, and my mums. So I mean, it could have been her not bothering to clean up after herself. After a few more days, that's what I began to think. I was certain that I'd already cleaned up. I was 100% certain of it. I'd wiped this surface, I'd cleaned that wall. Where was this water coming from? Why was there so much damn hair I'm this bath all the time?

After a couple more days, things took a turn for the worse. The long black hairs started to multiply, once there was a hair or two at a time. Then 3, then 4 and sooner than I realised, I'd be finding small knots of hair. Wet, slimy hair. It honestly looked more like it was from a dirty lake, than from my clean bath. I didn't know what to do! My mum never seemed to see it, and it couldn't be from anywhere else. So I ended up just doggedly cleaning it up, time after time. Before long I'd be trying to pick up clumps of hair, stringy back webs of hair.

Black, brown, blonde and grey. Wait, blonde hair? Grey hair? I lost it at at that point. The hair was turning up in all kinds of colours and shades. My mum and I definitely both had black hair, so I was at my wits end. Cleaning up hair was a frustrating task as it was, have you ever tried to pick wet hair out of a bath? It's a nightmare sometimes, especially when you're trying to hold up a towel with one hand already. I was convinced that there was an issue in the pipes, the builders must have fucked up the pipes. I was sure it was something like that, what else could it have been? 

This morning was the final straw, I was standing in the shower. I'd just finished washing my hair, and I found myself looking down at my feet. I was watching the shampoo remnants wash away down the plug hole, between my toes. When I saw a hair, waving in the current of the water. I thought nothing of it, other than annoyance at its presence. Showering had become nothing short of a chore, ever since the hair had started appearing. I hated it. 
I was about the resume my shower when something made me look back down. Something was wrong, but I didn't know what. A stray fleck of soap dripped down from my skin and swirled away into the blackness of the plug hole. That's when I realised, the single strand of awful hair I was looking at wasn't washing away. It was writhing in the water, coming out of the plug hole. It was fighting the current, not moving with it. 

I was perplexed, but still, I finished my shower as usual. Turned off the current and stepped out of the bath. I shrouded myself in a towel, and bent closer down for a look. The hair was no longer moving, and I told myself that it had just been a trick of the light. Or something like that. I reached into the base of the bath to pluck the hair from its watery resting place, but it slipped from my fingers. It slither further into the plug hole, hanging across the silver divider between the bath and the dark pipes below. I grabbed the hair with two fingers and I began to pull, the hair was longer than any I'd ever seen. It kept coming, more and more, being pulled out into the light of my bathroom. The hair was now pulling more hairs out too, strand after strand. I was pulling up clumps of dirty, matted hair, all wrapped in sludge from the depths of the pipes underneath my bath. There was a stench building, growing in strength as the piles of hair in my bath grew. It reeked, like rubbish and decay. I gagged, but I was determined. I was almost in a frenzy to get the hair out of my bath, out of the plug and free from my pipes. I was like an animal, in my mind I thought that this must be the cause of my problem. Some age of clump of hair, stuck in the labyrinth of pipes buried in the ground. 
I pulled and pulled, suddenly the hair went tight. The hair was stuck, I felt like I was so close now, this must be the final clump. I climbed into the bath and kneeled down, slipping over the disgusting piles of hair. My knees slick with water and ooze. My left hand was clutching the hair, my right was holding onto the bath rim in a bid to stable myself. I tried to pull on the strands, to free the clump. I still had to be careful not to snap the hairs or drop them. I couldn't risk losing them forever back down the pipe. 
The hair wouldn't loosen, no amount of pulling or tugging was inching this mess of hair closer to freedom. I decided to try and get a look inside the plug, the light was on already so I leaned forward. I was trying to lean forward, I couldn't get a good angle to see down there and I was getting more and more annoyed with each passing moment. 

My hair fell past my eyes, but before I could brush it back from my face, it was snagged by the plug. No, it was grabbed by something in the plug hole. I panicked, I could feel my hair being pulled down into the inky black below, I tried to stand up in a panic. But I couldn't. My towel slipped from around me, and I was stuck, naked in a half crouch. Before my mind could clear enough to think about my next move, my hair was yanked incredibly hard. I was pulled forward so hard, that I slipped and smashed face first into the faucet. I let out a cry of pain, my cheek was in agony. My hair was pulled again, and my face was once again rammed into the taps. I felt a crunch, and my face exploded into white hot pain. I tried desperately to pull away, my hands slick with water. I felt my hair lose tension, as whatever was pulling on me relaxed its grip. I hastily crawled backwards on my hands and knees, my eyes blurred with tears. I gripped my hair in both hands, trying to free myself from this nightmare. But suddenly I was pulled again, there was an inhuman strength in the pull and I flew back towards the taps. I saw a final glint of silver, before the faucet hit. My mouth struck the taps, my lip split as my teeth were smashed from their roots. I screamed through a mouthful of blood and loose teeth.  They plunked down onto the ceramic underneath my swollen face, sounding like pennies dropping into a well.
My hair finally ripped free from my scalp, with an agonising tear. I saw skin, and blood fly past my field of vision and plop down near the plug. I watched in muted amazement as the strands slithered off down into the darkness. What the fuck just happened? I knelt in disbelief, crying in pain and dripping blood from my ruined face.

I could hear my mum walking up the stairs, shouting something. I couldn't focus, I could barely see. I blinked hard, trying to clear my vision. Blood was swirling near the plug, when I saw something that sent me reeling. I stumbled, trying to stand up and grab a towel. I panicked, screaming in fear and pain. I could hear my mum at that point, outside the door, shouting about cleaning up. 

I haven't moved yet, I'm still sitting with my back pressed up against the door. I'm watching the plug; where a single, thin and pale finger has emerged to reach my spilt blood.

Now I know that the hair wasn't mine. </TEXT>

The question is why. 
It's obviously escalating now, as you're hearing voices. I thinking that this force whatever it is is trying to wear you down, to make you easier to manipulate or control. Stop using the GPS for a while, maybe walk or use public transport.

<TEXT> This was written as if harmony was much younger. So the entire story all I could think about was how little care you had for her safety.

It kind of spoiled it for me.
Also, I would have just called social services, she clearly needed more help than a futon to sleep on. Your actions could have saved a families lives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She sounds lovely..
Her poor eyesight probably makes her even more sensitive to the visions of the spirits, souls etc.
If she was being kept outside and not primarily as a house cat, that would explain some of the other behaviors ie the claws being out a lot and the pacing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why would keoni steal money? 
If keoni had stolen the money, he wouldn't have been kept alive.. Generally speaking, if you cross 'the mob' you end up dead. I think the mob knew of his ability, and kept him there for a reason.. maybe to heighten his desire to do things, but the tipster gave the game away maybe. </TEXT>

Also, any trial outcomes are listed in public records. So waiting so many years for the police reports was a waste of time.

Did your mother not teach you about the beauty within all things?
I'm sure that you mentioned inner and outer beauty. The way hannah acts and speaks, makes it seem as though her beauty is not quite total. Unless that is just the way it has been written.

It shouldn't fall to any one person to decide who is an ugly. Some people would even argue that your constant judgement makes you an ugly.

<TEXT> Significant parts of the amazon, over by the amazon river... This makes it sound as though the amazon is like the size of a Tesco or something. There is very little detail and it kind of seems that you don't know much about where you went or what you do.

Also, no body = no murder. You should definitely go to the police, right now it's a missing persons case.

Also, there would be no contractual agreement that prevents you from uploading work that isn't suitable for use. You could even just upload the cropped image, showing only the demon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well; the mushrooms would explain why your friend is acting weird.
However, it doesn't explain the creatures or how those bodies are still moving around after 100+ years.
The symbol in the room is also significant, was it a cult site or were there demons etc.
Regardless, it's not a good idea to go back there.

You could call the police, but if the military boarded it up you might just get in trouble.

Another thing, you run the risk of having disturbed whatever forces exist there. Because you've taken one of it's victims away. So be careful. </TEXT>

Like, we are free to pick and choose what to believe in. But you picked to harrass people on the street about their personal beliefs.

Also, god / the devil will know that you've only picked up the bible to try and save yourself. That is not true belief, and doesn't really help.

You need to show that you are truly sorry, and try to appease this lady.
I don't know why god would let her harrass you though, seems a bit mean. </TEXT>
