<TEXT> Has there ever been a time where you were the only one in a theater, and it made the movie creepier to watch? Like if it was a horror movie, or something like that. When I went to see Coraline on a weekday evening after school, the only people in the theater were a mom and her daughter sitting near the front. It really creeped me out. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Most effective jump scares in non-horror films? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-04 19:00:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Jump scares in horror movies are very common, and it's something we've all come to expect. However, what do you think are some effective jump scares in non-horror movies? The Lord of the Rings scene with Bilbo (you know the one) is usually the first one that comes to mind for me, but I recently watched Unbreakable for the first time and it had some effective jump scares towards the end. That scene where Bruce Willis opens the door and sees the homeowner dead and bloody on the floor was pretty disturbing. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's one of those movies that's faded into complete obscurity, and you never hear a word about it. But anyway, has anyone here seen it? You can find it on YouTube, and it's a 90's movie about bullying. Despite it's cheesiness (and trust me, this movie is the very definition of cliche and cheesy), it's definitely one of the most intense movies about bullying I've seen. I was surprised at how crude and violent the movie got at times with the bullying. The whole situation with the bully felt a bit unrealistic, though. It seems like all 3 of the kids could have collectively brushed him off. They made it seem like the bully was some super powerful force of nature.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Shyamalan is known for his twists, but you're really overthinking it. There's no way he would go as far to have us think the flashbacks belong to Casey if they were really Kevin's all along. Besides, in an interview for the movie, M Night was talking about Casey in the flashbacks and said something to the effect of - "She had this traumatic experience with her uncle". Shyamalan referring to the kid in those flashbacks as a "she" clearly means those flashbacks are of Casey when she was little girl. 

As for how the Beast formed, remember Kevin works at a zoo as a janitor. The Beast originated from the animals he saw on a daily basis, hence the Beast having tough skin like a rhino and being able to run fast, climb walls, and even bend steel bars. Not to mention the way he devoured those two girls is the same way a hungry lion or tiger devours its helpless prey. The Beast has traits of several zoo animals, and Patricia also mentions this. Also, I think Dennis was the personality that formed from Kevin's abuse by his mom. Kevin's mom was a neat freak who would abuse him if things weren't clean, and that's how Dennis formed. Hence why he has OCD and wants everything super clean. </TEXT>

It's just a boring, charmless, ugly rip-off of Madagascar and the Lion King. That sub-plot about the wildebeest wanting to eat lions was ridiculous too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is inspired by a recent discussion from when someone posted that abduction clip from Fire in the Sky. Looking back, how did the movie only manage to get a PG-13 rating? I mean, sure almost nothing happens for a large amount of the movie, but the abduction scene on the table is basically torture porn. The movie doesn't really have any blood or gore, but those torture scenes are absolutely horrifying to watch. Heck, I've even seen plenty of R-rated movies which don't even come close to being that graphic. The movie should have gotten an R-rating. Anyone else agree? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happy Feet is without a doubt, one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. I mean, it's just so bizarre. It's like a mishmash of High School Musical, March of the Penguins, and an episode of the Twilight Zone. It has no idea what it wants to be half of the time, and by the time Mumble goes insane in the mental hospital zoo, it's like something out of a Stephen King narration. The propaganda stuff didn't even bother me that much...at least not in comparison to how weird the movie is.

<TEXT>  He has no reason to leave. When I drop passengers off anywhere commercial I tend to stay.

It wasn't that the driver didn't leave, as much as it my suspicions that he was waiting outside because he was getting ready to call the police. I definitely think he would've had I stayed at the store any longer. He wasn't playing around, and was also on the phone with someone when my new driver came to pick me up. 

 Now approaching the other driver too is legitimate if a driver had concerns over a scam.

Of course it's legitimate, but outright telling the other driver that I plan to cancel and scam them, on the other hand, is not.

<TEXT> It happened to me the other night. When I was on the way home after seeing the new Power Rangers, I was messing with the Lyft app and I accidentally cancelled. The driver thought I was trying to scam him. I tried explaining to him, but he didnt believe me at all. He dropped me off at a nearby store, and told me to get out. I thought he would leave afterwards, but he didnt. Now, this is when things started to get intense.

I requested another ride, and when a new driver showed up at the store, I noticed the other driver was still waiting outside. He ran up to the car window, and started trying to convince the new driver that I was scamming and planning to cancel. Ok, I don't mind the driver getting mad and dropping me off after I cancelled (even if I cancelled by accident), but he really should have left after dropping me off. At the very least, don't try convincing other drivers that I'm planning to scam. It seemed like he was one step away from calling the police. Oh well, at least I contacted Lyft and they said they'd pay the driver back. </TEXT>
