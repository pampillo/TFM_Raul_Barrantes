<TEXT> Would it make everyone feel better if I said the both parties are full of crap? I think Comey deserved to be fired....... a year ago, not intelligent doing it now that he is leading the investigation. 

Yet partisan politics and a strong desire to avoid seeming like Obama is helping the Democrat candidate using the Executive is why he wasn't fired earlier. Identity politics will always be a part of life so long as people have different opinions.  </TEXT>

Officials said Comey was fired because senior Justice Department officials concluded he had violated Justice Department principles and procedures by publicly discussing the investigation of Hillary Clintons use of private email. Just last week, President Trump publicly accused Comey of giving Clinton a free pass for many bad deeds when he decided not to recommend criminal charges in the case.   

That's about as clear as it gets. DOJ believes that Comey affected election results.   

The DOJ really gave him a hard "fuck you." It's fairly evident that he improperly tampered with an election. 

The FBIs reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice, Rosenstein wrote. I cannot defend the directors handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clintons emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.

In a letter to Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that he agreed.

I have concluded that a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI, Sessions wrote. I must recommend that you remove Director James B. Comey, Jr. and identify an experienced and qualified individual to lead the great men and women of the FBI.

Shortly before the announcement, the FBI notified Congress by letter that Comey had misstated key findings involving the Hillary Clinton email investigation during testimony last week, but nothing about that issue seemed to suggest it might imperil Comeys job.  

Also definitely possible this is a scapegoat or a way to distract from Russian interference. Comey being incompetent and unlawfully interfering with an election *and* a foreign actor interfering *and* Comey being scapegoated can be true.

Eight Democratic Senators on Tuesday asked U.S. regulators to launch an investigation into billionaire Carl Icahns activities in the U.S. biofuels blending credit market, **saying the activist investor may have violated securities trading laws since becoming an adviser to President Donald Trump.**

We began our meeting telling him that there had been press accounts of statements from the Vice President and others that related to conduct that General Flynn had been involved in that we knew not to be the truth, said Yates. The vice president was knowingly making false statements to the American public, and General Flynn was compromised by the Russians.

She's currently defending her decision not to enforce Trump's immigration EO. This doesn't seem relevant to the proceedings at hand, but leave it to Republicans to bring up something irrelevant.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The project began when Mars was feeling depressed after the Brexit vote, far from home on an artists residency in upstate New York. A US academic came out on the porch and, promising to cheer her up, read Joyces letters aloud for half an hour. It did the trick  and now she wants to share this cheering potential. Theres something joyous about making something personal and taboo into a communal activity, she says. I want to talk about bodies  I want to talk about pleasure.

Just goes to show that Brexit was a path to shit.  </TEXT>

It's a legitimate concern and since we're often talking to clients soon after the assault, it's important to not set off any negative triggers early on during representation.

<TEXT> Honestly, I agree on a personal standpoint, but the word victim is still worse. It's a little awkward referring to the client as a survivor and it sometimes leads to questions that get far deeper into the psych realm than I have the knowledge or capability to deal with. Regardless, it does help in terms of results, so I'm not gonna knock it. 

The terms are effectively interchangeable in this context so the main reason we use survivor is, as you point out, for empowerment. People like to believe they made it through something. When you survive, the implication is that there was something that occurred that you made it through due to something you did and maybe some luck and maybe some other factors. When you're a victim, a bad thing happened to you and you had no control. Survival is active, being a victim is passive (at least in terms of perception). Even as an attorney, I need to focus on making sure the client feels like s/he has control over their life, not only because it helps them recover, but also because it makes my life easier in getting testimony out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hah. Addressed in another comment. Short answer: no. I had both male and female clients. All had legitimate claims. If they ever went to something that seemed dubious, I could usually get a good idea of what actually happened. I screened one where there was an issue of both parties possibly committing abuse, but the issue the client wanted solved couldn't be fixed by us as it was unrelated to domestic violence or assault. Ultimately, if someone doesn't want a protection order, not much I can do for them except offer sympathy. I'm an attorney, not a therapist. 

A couple sources I found list the false/unsubstantiated reporting number at about 5-7%. The studies seem to deal with low sample sizes, so I'm not sure how good that number is. The false accusation rate is far lower than most people seem to believe, though. There's a huge underreporting problem as well as certain police departments convincing survivors to change their story or file a lesser offense so that rape/sexual assault numbers will be down for that precinct.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tl;dr: Yeah, it's still a good guideline with the caveat that modern understanding of psychology, trauma, sociology, and crime will probably inform how you conduct the interview. Also, the terminology has changed a little. 

Umm, regularly about 3 years ago. Off and on since then, so I'm not really out of it. I was a student attorney back when I worked domestic violence cases regularly so it was a lot of training on everything from client interactions to gender studies, critical race theory, poverty studies, etc. A lot of it, particularly the gender studies work, was new to me. Oh, also a bit of psychology thrown in too, especially trauma psychology. 

So, yes, there are differences in the way you approach these interviews now simply by nature of how our understanding of sociology has changed. Terminology is different too (say survivor instead of victim, as it's more empowering and rape trauma can lead to feelings of lack of control over one's own life). But the general guidelines for the interaction itself track. The goal is for the client to feel safe. Also, obviously watch out for problems with the testimony that could signal a fake claim, though those are not as common as you'd think being on this site. 

Frankly, despite the Reddit hate on for false accusations and the like, it's still a highly underreported crime. Yes, being falsely accused of a sex crime can ruin your life. So can getting raped. Both are bad. But we'd like to encourage reporting of criminal activity so that, you know, people don't think it's okay to rape someone. 

So to sum up, some of the psychology understanding and terminology has changed. Procedure is largely the same. Also, it's normal to deal with a client who gets irrationally (or rationally based on what you're asking) angry at you or cries uncontrollably or whatever. We were trained to deal with hostile/combative witnesses as well. Also male clients since, obviously, it happens to both. We also focused on how two individuals in a relationship can have vastly different stories and the importance of treating both as clients. 

I had some experience as a student attorney with minors who were adjacent to the abuse and possibly suffered some (some direct representation), though you typically don't want to get them involved unless they're the direct victim of whatever assault. None of my clients who were kids had sexual abuse claims, though I've since done some stuff with anti-child sex trafficking advocacy. With kids, what you say depends on age but at some point, you're probably going to need to call a specialist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This actually tracks with what I did when I worked on domestic violence/sexual assault cases a while back. There's a couple minor differences, but it's pretty spot on in terms of interviews with survivors. The key is to always be professional and be compassionate while clinical. Also, accept that sometimes you're the wrong person to do the interview if there's particularly severe trauma and the individual isn't reacting well to you. Although, I will say, as a dude working in the field, my colleagues were more likely to recommend I not do the interview so I don't trigger anything than the actual client ever was (no client ever had an issue with me and could clearly separate me from her attacker).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. I dunno, seems like a common sense thing. If it's about a film that's still in production/hasn't been released it's probably a spoiler. If it's about the very existence of a film (Untitled Avengers 4), it's probably not. 

Something like "Rocket is in Avengers 8" easily leads you to the logical conclusion that Rocket is still relevant in Avengers 8, hasn't died at that point, and Bradley Cooper is actually Thanos (or something, I don't know how Avengers 7 ends). 

So something like this post is a pretty bright line spoiler since you know that something from Avengers 2 is going to have some role in Avengers 3. Speculation based on existing Canon and trailers and such seems fair game since it's what makes us fans so rabid and lovable. But production stills, even if the production team wants them out there, is probably closer to spoilers.

There's definitely a fanbase that loves that stuff and wants to discuss its implications, I totally respect that, and believe they should be allowed to do so. But there's also people that want to be part of the community but don't want every detail about the making of a movie or show before it comes out. Both types of fan deserve to be able to talk in their respective realms of knowledge, but the more spoiler friendly crowd has a slight upper hand here since they don't care as much about the titles of posts. 

Would having a rule just on titles, where it can say "Spoilers A:IW" or something work? Like you can expand on the type of spoiler, like "Spotted on the set of [MCU]" without saying what's been spotted or anything like that?  </TEXT>

It's really cool and if that's your thing discuss away, but some people, I'm sure, actually do want a place to discuss the films, shows, and canon and speculate about future films without having them spoiled from production stills.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you brown the onions and garlic, little bits stick to the bottom of the pan these little bits are quite tasty, but stuck. To make them unstuck and make them a part of the pasta experience, you use liquid while the pot is still hot. Basically like cleaning off the bottom with stock or water or wine or whatever. When you pour the liquid in, use a wooden spoon to gently scrape the stuck bits of the bottom so the bottom has few to no stuck bits left and they're all incorporated into whatever you're making. 

The pouring of the liquid and scraping of the brown bits off the bottom is called deglazing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No? Luke Skywalker is Leia Organa Solo's twin brother. Leia Organa Solo is/was married to Han Solo. Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo have a natural born son named Ben Solo. Sometime later, Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo separate and/or divorce. Han Solo is Luke Skywalker's brother-in-law by marriage to Luke Skywalker's twin sister, Leia Organa Solo. Han Solo is Aldo arguably Luke Skywalker's best friend. Ben Solo is also Kylo Ren. Ben Solo/Kylo Ren is thus Luke Skywalker's nephew by blood, being Luke Skywalker's sister's natural born son. Ben Solo/Kylo Ren kills Han Solo, his blood-related father. When one kills one's father, it is called patricide. 

Therefore, Luke feels the ripples in the Force of the killing of his best friend and brother-in-law, Han Solo, by his nephew, Ben Solo/Kylo Ren, who was committing patricide. He has a blood connection to Ben Solo/Kylo Ren, arguably meaning he has a stronger connection to him and any Dark Side actions, like patricide, would be felt more strongly.

<TEXT> Obvious spoilers below for everything. 

Goes back to a proposed title of Star Wars, "Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars." That also included the first mention of the Kyber Crystals featured in Rogue One. The concept of the Whills has since been incorporated into the current canon through the books and such. In particular, Qui-Gon Jinn, studied the from the Whills to become a Force ghost (possibly) in Clone Wars TAS and Chirrut Imwe is part of the Guardians of the Whills in Rogue One. It's a quick expository line by Cassian when they're on Jedha.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The case was widely discussed throughout the political sphere while the debate was ongoing on the initial version of the AHCA. It was commented on by the White House and Congressional Republicans as a textbook example of illegal immigration hurting Americans. As such it was used to push anti-immigration and nationalist messaging at the time of Trump's first healthcare push with the AHCA (in fact, covered on Fox more than the the-failing GOP healthcare bill. Those fears appear to now be, as they were then, unwarranted. 

That case became explosive as political factions seized on its volatile mix of crime and illegal immigration.

Montano came to the U.S. from El Salvador, and Sanchez Milian from Guatemala. They were stopped at the border, detained, then allowed to continue on to relatives before they enrolled in Rockville at a ninth grade level.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the case during a daily briefing and said the idea that this occurred is shocking, disturbing, horrific, Spicer said.

Part of the reason that the president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this  Immigration pays its toll on our people if its not done legally, and this is another example, Spicer said.

Demonstrators converged on county government offices and hundreds of calls, emails and texts went to the school system bashing undocumented immigrant students, assailing school policies and demanding the ouster of the superintendent. Police provided protection at the school after the threats.

In Annapolis, politicians referred to the case in denouncing legislation that would have limited cooperation between local police and immigration authorities; the legislation was defeated weeks later.

Immigration advocates and the county schools superintendent publicly spoke out about the charges, voicing horror and regret and also saying politicians should not judge immigrant children seeking a better life for themselves by the disturbing case. We are a public school system, and we serve all of our students when they come to us, Schools Superintendent Jack Smith said.

Sanchez Milians father, Adolfo Sanchez-Reyes, was drawn into the rippling effects of the investigation when immigration agents looking into the suspects backgrounds concluded the father was in the country illegally and placed him in custody. His immigration case is pending, said his attorney, Himedes V. Chicas.

It was not immediately clear what immigration consequences may await the two teens.

According to the defense lawyers, the day before the incident, the girl and Montano, exchanged explicit text messages and images about planning to have sex in the school. Video from school cameras showed Montano and the girl walked together into the bathroom at the time of the incident, according to the attorneys, who also said the girls account of events was not consistent as the investigation progressed.

At no point did the girl express any reluctance with any sex acts, said Jezic. From the night before, she actively planned a sexual encounter.

<TEXT> Narrated by Sir David Attenborough. 

The dragon burns its prey before consuming it. The sheep writhes in pain, its offspring looking on. Too young to continue without their mother and with the rest of the flock corralled by fire, a grim fate is certain for these sheep. 

The shepherd will not long survive without the sheep to sell at market. King Aegon will not compensate for the cruel fate he has endured. The hunt for a new life must emerge from the ashes of his trade. So does the cycle continue under the Targaryen rein in the Seven Kingdoms.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> FYI r/news mods are deleting anything related to the passage of this bill as "politics" even if it's news. 

From the [NYTimes article](https://nyti.ms/2pLo7He), relevant bits if paywalled:

WASHINGTON  The House on Thursday narrowly approved a bill to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, as Republicans recovered from their earlier failures and moved a step closer to delivering their promise to reshape American health care without mandated insurance coverage.

The vote, 217-213, on President Trumps 105th day in office, keeps alive the Republican dream to unwind the signature legislative achievement of former President Barack Obama. The House measure faces profound uncertainty in the Senate, where the legislations steep spending cuts will almost certainly be moderated. Any legislation that can get through the Senate will again have to clear the House and its conservative majority.

/break

We are all breathing a sigh of relief, Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, said. Were living up to a campaign promise we made, the Senate made, the president made.

Democrats vowed to make Republicans pay a high political price for pushing such unpopular legislation. I have never seen political suicide in my life like Im seeing today, Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, said.

The House bill would eliminate tax penalties for people who go withouthealth insurance. It would roll back state-by-state expansions ofMedicaid, which covered millions of low-income Americans.

In place of government-subsidized insurance policies offered exclusively on the Affordable Care Acts marketplaces, the bill would offer tax credits of $2,000 to $4,000 a year, depending mainly on age. A family could receive up to $14,000 a year in credits. The credits would be reduced for individuals making over $75,000 a year and families making over $150,000.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the first version of the bill would trim thefederal budgetdeficit considerably but would also leave 24 million more Americans without health insurance after a decade. Insurance premiums would spike next year before settling lower after a decade.

/break 

In truth, Republicans argued, with so many problems afflicting the Affordable Care Act, the status quo is unsustainable, regardless of what Congress does. Mr. Trump pointed to Aetnas announcement this week that it would no longer offer policies on Virginias Affordable Care Act exchange.

Death spiral! the president wrote on Twitter.

People with pre-existing conditions will be affected and many will likely die if this bill passes the Senate and gets signed into law. 

Congratulations GOP: You created a death panel and voted to kill Americans.       </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well according to the movie Reavers are just people driven to extremes by a chemical designed to make them more passive. For the majority, it made them stop caring about everything until they stopped autonomic functions and died. For others, it made them go extreme and experience all emotions simultaneously at their highest level and therefore exist in a perpetual frenzy. 

Actually one of the most fascinating things about the series excluding the movie is the scariest moments involve a person who has only been adjacent to the horrors that Reavers did to his companions. Now imagine what the real thing is like.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whole article, emphasis added:

The House voted to approve a roughly $1.1 trillion spending bill which includes **more than $15 billion in defense spending and $1.5 billion in money for U.S. border security**. The measure is expected to come up for a vote later this week in the Senate ahead of a deadline to keep the government open past Friday.

The spending measure also contains nearly $5 billion domestic spending increases, **including $295 million to help Puerto Rico continue making payments to Medicaid, $61million to reimburse local law enforcement agencies for the cost of protecting Trump when he travels to his residences in Florida and New York, major priorities for Democrats**. The bipartisan agreement comes after weeks of tense negotiations that briefly broke down after President Trump insisted that the spending measure include money to begin building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump dropped those demands, clearing the way for a final deal.

Among the bipartisan wins is **$100million to combat opioid addiction and money to combat wildfires**. Democratic and GOP leaders have boasted that the deal contains significant wins for each side but the partisan bickering is expected to begin anew in the coming weeks when negotiations begin on spending for the fiscal year that begins in October.

<TEXT> Dunno that this is news strictly because it's entirely plaintiff's point of view from a biased source. The allegation isn't great though.  

Edit: Wait hang on, this happened while she was on her own motor scooter? 

Because of the downward angle of the jetway, at one point the front wheels of the scooter suddenly and rapidly descended which caused her to be pitched forward from her scooter onto the ground fracturing her left leg above the knee.
All of this could have been avoided if the gate agents at United had only allowed her to use a wheelchair. There were available wheelchairs right there at the gate, said Remington.

How would being on the shittier United wheelchair have prevented this situation?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on the masters program, really. The testing for it is apparently rough. And some of the best teachers get PhDs. 

Regardless, teachers don't necessarily all stay local. They're about as incentivized to move as anyone else. But just looking at monetary incentives, families tend to send their kids to the best schools. If they lack the means for private school, they will still do whatever it takes to get the kid to the best school possible, even if that means picking up and moving to a different district. Teachers, naturally, have the same profit incentives. However, this may be curbed by altruism or some other factor, leading them to improve a bad neighborhood, rather than maintain a good one. 

This, of course, means that there exists a demand for the best teachers. This is, in the case of private schools, compensated. In the case of public schools, it is not. This is because the immediate effect on the neighborhood is not clear. If they were doctors under the same public system, you'd probably make the same argument, that there's no value added to keeping someone healthy. You're just maintaining the status quo. After all a doctor fixes problems with people. Doctors don't just improve an already healthy person (so the argument would go, obviously a good doctor works to help patients improve their lifestyle). A good doctor would be worth their weight in gold, but they wouldn't get paid that. Why? Because a public egalitarian system has built in protections against a meritocracy versus a private system, in which the best performers advance. 

The problem is a little bit economic, but largely societal. We simply don't value teachers as much because they're teachers and we view it as a lesser profession. It's summed up in the stupid idiom, "Those who can't do, teach." It's stupid because passing on knowledge is arguably the greatest things those who can do will do so that society grows from past work. Perhaps it's, again, because it's seen as women's work (like the undervaluing of nursing as a profession until recently). The family benefits by having an educated child with more opportunities available than without the good teacher. But whatever the reason, there's an implicit bias against rewarding positive outcomes in teaching.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Desiree Fairooz has been convicted for laughing early in Mr Sessions' confirmation hearing after Alabama Senator Richard Shelby said that the future attorney general's record of "treating all Americans equally under the law is clear and well documented." She has been convicted alongside two other protesters who had donned Ku Klux Klan costumes during the confirmation. Those two protesters could also face up to a year in prison.

The conviction comes after a two-day trial in the United States Superior Court in Washington. Ms Fairooz told theNew York Timesthat she is "really disappointed" and that her lawyer are planning on filing post-trial motions to have the verdict cast aside. It is too early to discuss an appeal she says.

Was she in her designated free speech zone, out of earshot or impact? No? She must fry. /s

This would be laughable if it wasn't the Justice Department literally ignoring the Constitution to shield a racist from criticism. It's a confirmation hearing open to the public, not a court room. If you can't exercise free speech in Congress, where can you?

I mean, senators openly scoff at remarks made at these hearings. I don't see charges leveled against them. Joe Wilson shouted "You lie" at the President during a State of the Union. That's clearly disruptive, but it's different if an ordinary citizen quietly snickers at the bullshit claims of a nominee for Attorney General.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eh I disagree in terms of value added and hazard. Frankly, the only reason we value an amazing teacher so low is a societal issue. And I'd love to see you argue that being a teacher isn't inherently dangerous to someone teaching in my district. A good teacher is worth their weight in gold in terms of value to the community. You think parents don't want their kids in college? Or that they don't want their children receiving the best education? Entire families move so their kids can go to the best schools. 

And it's not like a good teacher doesn't attract money. Good teachers can bring attention to a district, leading to an influx of higher income families and therefore more money for the community to play with. The problem is that because it's publicly funded, people see both an egalitarian approach and a personal investment in the stake of the enterprise (in a way that Browns fans can't seem to grasp). Therefore, the entire "my tax dollars pay your salary so I can tell you how to do your job" attitude towards public education. If their child fails due to personal issues, it's blamed on the school, not any other issues that might arise in the child's life. 

The best teachers, regardless, should be paid more if the system you're arguing exists actually does, but they're not. They're just not paid less, unless the district feels that the schools are underperforming, in which case everyone suffers. Look at the example of private schools where teachers can make more with fewer credentials. Why is the lower valued individual being paid more? Simply because the private education creates exclusivity and therefore raises rates. It's not that one creates inherently more value than the other. It's just in one case, the government is setting the wage and standards and in another, private institutions are. 

I went to a public school where everyone had to have a Masters degree to teach. They were paid less than the lawyers. Why? Lawyers also get, effectively, a Masters degree (I should know, I am one). We have created a system wherein being a teacher is not competitive except in the top school districts nationwide. In those districts, you can clearly see the added value that comes from a good educational system. The problem is societal, which contributes to economics, yes. But it's not just value in versus value out.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, a welder gets paid more with less training. And I know teachers that get "hazard pay" because of the schools they teach in so it's not a danger factor. And teaching isn't by any means easy (unless you think it's easy to teach someone basic knowledge while they're still learning anything from fine motor control to emotional control). No knock on welders, they're dope, but the argument that teachers get paid less because they're less educated is frankly bullshit. Public school teachers have far stricter and longer education requirements than private school teachers and get paid less, so the correlation isn't there even within the profession. 

It's because we Americans as a society fundamentally don't respect public education as an institution. Arguably because it was at one point decided that it's a women's profession therefore worth less, but whatever the reason, it has nothing to do with the level or intensity of training.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lincoln-Douglas was largely about slavery and states' rights, and from the beginning, Lincoln advocated for the 1850 Compromise model limiting the westward expansion of slavery. Limiting slavery *was*, as I said, tepid abolitionism. But I agree, he didn't start off wanting to end slavery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a small grain of truth to what he's saying in that if the Democrats had won in 1860, the Civil War may not have happened due to the country's leadership being more gun shy about abolition/pro-slave-owning. This, of course, ignores that the election of Lincoln was itself a public referendum on slavery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The answer is slavery. It was fought over states' rights to own slaves and Lincoln's early tepid abolitionist stance, which was still a radical departure from previous presidents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It also demonstrates a lack of knowledge of history. Yes, the Spartans were great warriors and Leonidas is a fascinating figure. Plutarch is really worth a read. However, the same qualities that made Sparta so powerful ultimately destroyed it from within. You can't have a society where the servants/slaves are treated terribly and are a significant portion of the population without encountering problems. The increasing helot revolts and the loss to Thebes at Leuctra was the beginning of the end of Sparta. Alexander effectively finished the job and the polis was only important for its strategic location during the Roman Empire's dominance in the region.  

Sparta is a study in hypocrisy. They fought so hard for their independence from everyone's influence while being cripplingly dependant on slave labor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jordan Edwards, a freshman at Mesquite High School, was leaving a party when he was shot through the passenger's side window of the vehicle, attorneyLee Merritt said.

No officers were injured in the incident.

/break

Balch Springs police Chief Jonathan Haber said officers heard gunshots as they were responding to a call of drunken teens about 11 p.m. in the 12300 block of Baron Drive.

During an altercation, the vehicle backed down the road toward officers "in an aggressive manner," Haber said. An officer fired at the vehicle and struck a passenger, who was then transported to the hospital and pronounced dead, Balch Springs police said in a prepared statement.

Ah yes, firing at a car leaving an area where the officers heard gunfire. I'm surprised they didn't just open up on the house.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Uh...how? 

Edit: Seriously, Pai is either cartoonishly evil or an idiot. 

Pai'sNPRM presents no evidence that the no-throttling rule hurts customers, but claimsthat the current rules were passed without evidence.The document seeks comment about whether the FCC should have any rules onblocking, throttling, and paid prioritization, but strongly suggests that such rules aren't necessary.

"Despite virtually no quantifiable evidence of consumer harm, the commission nevertheless determined that it needed bright-line rules banning three specific practices by providers of both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access service: blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization," Pai'sdraft proposal says.

Break

The NPRM also suggests that customers arebeing harmed by the ban onISPs charging websites and other online services for faster access to consumers. "Is there a risk that banning paid prioritization suppresses pro-competitive activity?" the NPRM asks. "For example, could allowing paid prioritization give Internet service providers a supplemental revenue stream that would enable them to offer lower-priced broadband Internet access service to end-users?"

The NPRM asks whether paid prioritization could "enable certain critical information, such as consumers health care vital signs that are being monitored remotely, to be transmitted more efficiently or reliably." But the document fails to mention that the existing rules have an exception that lets ISPssell isolated network capacityfor telemedicine services.

The FCC also askswhether it shouldkeep rules that require ISPs to make greater disclosures about hidden fees and data caps. The FCC seems to think the broadband market is so competitive that this isn't necessary. "We seek comment on whether the additional reporting obligations from that rule remains necessary in todays competitive broadband marketplace," the NPRM says. Pai has alreadyexemptedISPs with 250,000 or fewer subscribers from these rules.

<TEXT> I have and this obviously gets a little touchy, but I think the show "pushes" gender identity as a theme more than letting it be a thing organically. For example, I think sexual orientation in the show is depicted much better as a casual thing (or even in something like Jessica Jones where it's present but not a focus). I think the transgender actress was amazing, but the actual depiction and storyline just felt forced. Sort of like the transgender brother in Orphan Black, you know?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ~~city~~ state is clearly posturing to get him to fuck off, but they're also technically correct. He can't represent himself as something he's not and use that to lend credibility to an official correspondence. There's a reason licensing requirements exist, though the fees are clearly a racket. If he'd just presented the findings without alleging credentials, he'd have been fine. 

The fine is stupid, but it looks like a case where they're both wrong. Except about the traffic light. I think he's got a point there.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who is currently watching the series, he really wouldn't. He's intelligent and well-spoken, and would have been good before his MS manifested, but he lied to the public, orchestrating a conspiracy, to conceal the fact that he has MS. There is an episode where he can't remember something that just happened in the Situation Room. He should have been impeached and removed from office. 

He also assassinates Sharif without due process in an operation that began while he was on U.S. soil. Also, he has his speech writers dictating actual policy and never punishes or fires his staff for major fuck ups, but does accept Leo's resignation when they disagree on one issue. 

He's a very okay and entertaining President on television, but he wouldn't be great in real life.

<TEXT> Hi Professor Epstein, 

What is your opinion on the Supreme Court decision in *Ledell Lee v. Arkansas*? More specifically:

Do you think it is within three bounds of due process to allow Arkansas to execute seven individuals in such a short period simply because the drug is expiring (and against the express desire of the manufacturer)? 

Do you believe that this decision fits with the precedent established in *Atkins v. Virginia* given that Mr. Lee may have been intellectually disabled? 

On a completely separate note, do you believe that when damages are awarded against the government in a case and Congress enacts a law preventing it from appropriating to paying out above a certain amount in that class of litigation, that this is an unconstitutional Taking? Especially if Congress provides no indication it will amend that legislation to allow future payments on that class of lawsuits. How would one resolve the political question issues? What are the Separation of Powers issues implicated by Congress refusing to comply with a court order to pay in such a case?

<TEXT> But you are the one confusion things, murder was a word before the US was even a thing. 

Yeah, with a legal definition. Murder is a legal concept. 

So basically you appropriate a word, give it a different meaning, and then complain people use it the way they have for a 1000 years. If you wanted to use a word for state-sanctioned murder, invent a new one.  

We have a word for state-sanctioned murder, it's called the death penalty or state-sponsored/legal execution.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think if  we are going to talk about what may very well have been a wrongful execution, after a criminal conviction for murder, it's appropriate to make the distinction that the state, by definition, can't murder. There's enough misunderstanding about the law as it is due to colloquial understanding, confusing people when they see certain decisions as it is. Might as well get the information out there.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah true, but the legal profession literally depends on lawyers following the ethics code to function. We self police it so hard because, in part, our profession depends on it to ensure our clients trust us (similar to doctors). While I agree P.E.'s also have a strict ethical code that they follow due to their professionalism and safety risk if they don't, engineering will exist as a profession even if ethical rules aren't strictly followed. Same with medicine. With law, it's hard to say.  </TEXT>

On Monday, the courts rejected a series of appeals by Mr. Jones and Mr. Williams, including an effort minutes before Mr. Williamss execution arguing it would be unconstitutionally cruel, based on complications Mr. Jones might have experienced. In a court filing, Mr. Williamss lawyers wrote that infirmary workers had tried unsuccessfully to insert a central line in Mr. Joness neck for 45 minutes, before placing it elsewhere on his body. Then Mr. Jones gulped for air during the execution, the filing said, evidence of continued consciousness. </TEXT>

But, as an attorney who actually works on these things, I have to work with the hand I'm dealt, not some ideal that I wish were the case. 

by your version of "due process" anyone murdered by the state who was innocent received their full constitutional rights regardless of any malfeasance or fraud, so long as everyone agrees to the malfeasance and/or fraud.

This is the case in the United States. Sucks right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> AttorneyRandall Wilhite said at a pretrial hearing in Austin last week that evaluating Jones based on his on-air comments is like judging Jack Nicholson based on his role as the Joker in Batman.

But Kelly Jones described her ex-husband as not a stable person, according to the Austin American-Statesman (http://atxne.ws/2pGyXLz). She said he is threatening toward others, noting homophobic comments hes made about Democratic U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff and a challenge to fight actor Alec Baldwin. He broadcasts from home, she said, and that exposes their children to his incendiary behavior.

The difference is, everyone is aware they're watching a movie when they see Nicholson's Joker. They're not aware that Alex Jones is "acting" when listening to him or reading his shitty website. Also, it's not fucking performance art, he's convincing real people to believe some crazy lies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They've got their reasons, albeit they're shitty. Basically, Turkey doesn't believe they're responsible for it because it technically occurred before the creation of the modern Turkish state and because the word genocide didn't exist when it occurred, so it would be ex post facto. This is significant because genocide is a war crime punishable by international law. Turkey doesn't want to mea culpa for a war crime they believe they didn't do. 

Of course they could call it a genocide and blame it on the government that committed the atrocity, but I guess it's just sort of stuck now. Note that Turkey doesn't really deny it happened, just that it's a genocide.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said you *need* a conductor. They're just not useless. Every band has someone taking the lead. Smaller ensembles might use the drummer or have the singer set the rhythm and tempo, but you don't just sit there and play mindlessly. There's a degree of focus and coordination that needs to happen that's much more difficult when you're part of a large section playing a similar part. The conductor just makes the process easier by delegating the role to one person. It could just as easily be the soloist. But there's always someone in some form of a conductor role, even if that person is also an instrumentalist. 

For example, with your orchestra or band, I imagine that you all didn't spontaneously decide to start playing. Someone led you. That's your conductor until the conductor shows up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Conductors also control section volume and shape the way the music sounds as a whole. They also set the style. No one musician can do that independently while being a part of the orchestra because you'd have a large number of people interpreting the music in whatever way they feel, which will sound off. The conductor is the person at the mixing board making sure the levels are correct and the various inputs are layered properly, largely because a conductor can hear it all better than anyone in the orchestra. 

If you play to a metronome only, you're going to have a very boring orchestra. It'll sound fine, but it won't be interesting. The conductor adds style.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well it kinda can't be. The law changed. Per the law at the time, Dredd Scott, unfortunately, made sense. Dredd Scott concerned the then-constitutional Fugitive Slave Clause. Supreme Court can't declare a part of the Constitution unconstitutional. That doesn't make any sense. 

Like I said, it's morally wrong, but the power to overturn it came from Congress, not the Court.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Morally, sure. But legally, Dredd Scott makes sense. Court doesn't have the power to alter the Constitution. That's why Dredd Scott makes sense. Plessy or Korematsu are both better examples of the failure of stare decisis. But Plessy is no longer good law and Korematsu, while it technically is, would not hold up as precedent.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dredd Scott was overturned by the President and Congress (to an extent) abolishing slavery. It's never been formally overturned.  

For that matter, Citizens United, but it's law. You can implement real change to shit decisions using the Court. Anyway it happens. Swift v. Tyson overruled by Erie is probably the best example.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Ben, 

Have you listened to any of the Chapo Trap House podcast reading series? Specifically, have you heard them review your book, True Allegiance? If so, how would you best characterize the accuracy of their review? Specifically, do you think they understood what you were going for, your broader themes, and your general world views? 

On the topic of valor, do you think that the team at Chapo Trap House demonstrated true valor by heroically making it through your book?

Regarding your writing, can you comment on any creative writing courses you've taken and if you have, your grades and the general attitude of your professors towards your writing? 

Regarding the characters in the book, were any based on real people, and if so, which character was based on which person? 

Finally, asking on behalf of a friend, do you think there's a difference between Jews/Judaism and Israel/Zionism? 

Thank you for your time.  

Edit: Oh and one last question, are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?  </TEXT>

I mean, seriously people, there's only one ocean in the vicinity. The Arctic is way further north.

<TEXT> For those who are both curious and lazy:

Egyptian authorities have hailed an "important discovery" after archaeologists unearthed several mummies, 10 colourful wooden sarcophagi and more than 1,000 funerary statues in a 3,500-year-old tomb near the city of Luxor.

The 18th Dynasty tomb, discovered in the Draa Abul Nagaa necropolis near the famed Valley of the Kings, belonged to a nobleman named Userhat who worked as the city judge, Egypt's antiquities ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.

"There are 10 coffins and eight mummies. The excavation is ongoing," Mostafa Waziri, the head of the archeological mission, told the AFP news agency.

It's a very significant find.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> PNA believes that, per Oslo, their authority applies inside the settlements. In fact, the entire purpose of the settlements is to have an Israeli foothold to establish authority in Palestinian land. Furthermore, the Israeli military has, in the past, employed martial law in Palestinian territories, most notably in Gaza in 2009, though there are other examples. Again, whose law was in control then? Palestinians have the legal authority they have through Oslo and the much more powerful Israeli government not imposing their authority. Their law is imposed because Israel allows it and not because of some inherent ability to self-govern. Not because of some right, but because this is the reality of the situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the perfect opportunity to bring up my favorite moment from Planet Earth. There's a scene where a crocodile attacks wildebeest, triggering a stampede. The stampede is shown in slow motion, all while David Attenborough narrates the chaos and power of the situation. Now, while this stampede is occurring, there's a zebra, also clearly panicking, running the other way. Attenborough never comments on this and the one off zebra, while the focus of the shot, is completely ignored. I found the scene in Japanese, but it's hilarious with the original, where there's a zebra perfectly in frame running the wrong way that is completely ignored for no discernable reason. It's tragic, beautiful, poetic even, but for the zebra, which makes it unintentionally hilarious. 

I call it random zebra: https://youtu.be/19UYHiVD40Y  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For context:

In the summer of 2015, after appearing on Anderson Coopers show, Trump complained to CNN that his interviews on the network were always followed by conversations among panelists who all seemed to hate him. The network asked Trump to suggest the names of some people who would defend him. One of those whom he mentioned was Jeffrey Lord.

Trump and Lord had met a couple of years earlier, in 2013. Lord was living with his elderly mother in Harrisburg, Pa., writing unpublished thrillers and screenplays. A former White House associate director for political affairs in the Reagan administration, he also dabbled in radio and TV political commentary and had written a few pieces about Trump for the right-wing magazine The American Spectator, including one headlined Never Ignore Donald Trump. The Spectator asked Lord to introduce Trump at a dinner at a hotel in Washington. Soon after that, Trump called Lord and proposed that they fly to Washington together on his plane. Lord was excited, but he hesitated; who would take care of his mother? A cousin in Binghamton, N.Y., not wanting Lord to miss the opportunity, offered to cover his caretaking duties for the night. The logistics were complex: Lord drove to Washington, parked his car near the hotel and took the train up to New York to meet Trump. He would fly down to D.C. with Trump and then drive straight home to his mother in Harrisburg when the dinner was over. I went to Trump Tower and they took me right up, and he was in there in his office, Lord says. We just hit it off. He took me up to the penthouse while he went to change his shirt.

**Lord made his CNN debut in July 2015. Two weeks later, CNN offered him a job as the networks first pro-Trump contributor. (CNN said it was already considering Lord and that Trumps suggestion had no effect on their decision to hire him.)** Today, he is one of 12 Trump partisans on CNNs payroll and perhaps the networks most reliable, if mild-mannered, provocateur; he recently defended Trumps tweet that Obama had orchestrated a Nixon/Watergate wiretapping plot against him, saying that the president was just speaking Americanese. The network sends a black town car four days a week to ferry him to Manhattan from Harrisburg and back, a three-hour drive each way. Lord has long since become a celebrity in Harrisburg  he was profiled on the front-page of the local newspaper  and now is recognized pretty much wherever he goes. The only CNN show he prefers not to do is Don Lemons, because it gets him back to his mother, who is now 97, too late. I dont get home until 1 in the morning; that gets a little difficult for Mom, he told me.

I could find them, but at this point, I don't want to become versed in airline law to figure out hypotheticals. Additionally there's a couple industry standard definitions for boarding, as you say. So it'll most likely, if it goes to a judge, be a question as to what definition governs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We can officially say that some elephants may be smarter and more self aware than the average human 2 year old. 

The new test, which was described asdeceptively simple,involved picking up a stick and handing it to a researcher.

But sometimes the stick was tied to a maton which the elephant had to stand to reach it.

This meant they had to realise their own body was preventing them from passing on the stick and get off the matin order to complete the task.

The scientists behind the study said animals capable of this kind of behaviour may also be better at empathising and be able to consider someone elses perspective.

.  .  . 

The elephants understood that their bodies were getting in the way, so they stepped aside to enable themselves to complete the task.

In a similar test, this is something that young children are unable to understand until they are about two years old.

This implies that elephants may be capable of recognising themselves as separate from objects or their environment.

This means that they may have a level of self-understanding, coupled with their passing of the mirror test, which is quite rare in the animal kingdom.

The test was an adapted version of one used on human children. In that test they are asked to push a trolley attached to a matt, which they normally stand on as they approach the trolley.

Only when they reach the age of about two do the humans realise they have to get off the matt in order for the trolley to move.

<TEXT> It's really pilot or crew, including flight attendants. I think his case against the airline is weak based on the CoC and that there's a much better case based on other facts. But while he could prevail in a lawsuit claiming he was improperly removed and the pilot was wrong, he still has to leave. His recourse isn't going to happen on that plane and he could be slapped with charges if he insists on staying.  

Like if you're going the speed limit and there's nothing wrong with your car you still have to pull over if a cop flashes his lights at you. Cop could be wrong and you can prove it in court, but on the highway is not where you get fight the decision to be pulled over.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It all started with an accusation that a black man raped a white woman. This was a common excuse to lynch black men. See, for example, Emmett Till.

Donham admitted that she "fabricated the interaction with Till while under oath during the trial of Till's murderers," wrote Thompson in the letter. This "false statement holds liability for the death of Emmett Louise Till" and "affords the DOJ [Department of Justice] the opportunity to bring some justice to an innocent 14-year old boy," Thompson wrote.

<TEXT> As a matter of federal law, the pilot's word about who can be and who cannot be on the plane is final. The moment you are told to leave, you have no choice but to leave that plane.

https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.3

Now, you can believe this is unfair and you can sue the airline for improper removal. But the moment you are told to leave, you can't stay there. Your boarding privilege has been revoked. You may still have a valid contract with the airline and this removal may be a breach of said contract, but you cannot force the airline to not breach your contract by staying on the plane. This is a post-9/11 safety rule and the FAA does not fuck around with pilot authority. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But that would be neurological. At least if it's cone-related, then applying a filter would help you contrast different colors better so you'd perceive the difference more readily. If you can already see red but your brain is translating it to something else, a filter won't make you see red because the problem isn't with the input, it's with the wiring. You'd have to solve the underlying neurological issue. Unless you perceive all colors as flipped, in which case, you wouldn't be seeing the same thing as everyone else, but functionally it would be the same, absent a few analogies. You'd probably not even know anything was wrong.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's three ways. You're genetically colorblind, you suffered and eye injury (physical, drug side effect, disease, etc.), or it's psychological. With the third, glasses may give you a placebo effect. With the second, you'd have to fix the underlying problem, but if the cones are gone they're gone. You might be able to regain a small amount of color vision with Enchroma, but it wouldn't be anywhere near what you had before. With the first, you are physically incapable of perceiving certain colors. No amount of filtration will fix the fact that you can't see blue or green or whatever your particular color blindness is. 

Interestingly, the less severe the color blindness, the more likely these are to work to enable you to see colors as the less severe, the more colors you can already see. So I can see this maybe helping someone see colors if they have a moderate case of color blindness. It won't do much for severe cases. Even Enchroma says their glasses only work for red-green color blindness. http://enchroma.com/contact-us/ </TEXT>

So with those glasses, if someone says point to the purple one, you'd still have trouble knowing which one that is. It would be nice to see there's a difference where you couldn't before, but I can easily see how this would turn frustrating for the color blind person as they are now expected to know what color something is when asked.

<TEXT> Right but I'm saying everyone thinks these make colorblind people see colors they couldn't before. That's not possible using just a filter. They likely can, as you said, differentiate colors better due to the way the light is filtered, but it'd look closer to extremes of the same color as opposed to two different colors. 

Cool, but not the same as what this video implies. Like that one where the guy is staring at his kids' eyes like he's never been able to see what color they are. If he's been seeing brown and they're green, he's not going to suddenly start seeing green. Because the other half is his brain has become used to processing that visual input as brown. So it'd just be a "greener" brown. 

I think we agree but if this is marketing, it's a shitty thing to play on emotions like that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure but you can't magically start seeing colors that you couldn't before without surgery and significant brain training. You'd probably be able to distinguish between the two a lot better, but the actual recognition of the new hue wouldn't occur simply because you applied a filter.  

If your friend got these glasses, he wouldn't now be able to see purple because his eyes lack the cones to see that color. His brain has been processing purple as brown his whole life. So he'd see maybe a different shade, maybe even one with more blue in it, but he wouldn't see the same purple you see.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, I'm actually starting to think these are faked. If he couldn't see color before, he wouldn't suddenly be able to start with glasses. The problem is inherent to his eyes because he doesn't have the right/enough cones. He can't suddenly see green or something. The glasses may enable him to differentiate green and red, for example, but he can't suddenly "see green." Also, given his age, his brain wouldn't be able to process the actual color anyway, it would recognize it as it always did. It would require a long time for him to "learn" the color he couldn't see before. The glasses don't give him cones or rewire his brain. 

And if it's a better distinction between colors his mind conflates, as I imagine it is, he probably wouldn't be super emotional about it. It'd be nifty, but it's like crying because you saw a movie in 3D because of the 3D. I'm guessing most of these videos are marketing by Enchroma.  

Edit: Alright, the earliest video for this I can find is on YouTube in December 2016, after which it was uploaded to Newsflare, which is what MSN uses to license and monetize videos. 

https://www.newsflare.com/video/109550/other/man-76-sees-colour-for-the-first-time-with-enchroma-glasses

https://www.newsflare.com/profile/OddStopWorkshop

The user that uploaded it only has two copies of the video, both posted in February at the same time. This video is also on YouTube, as I mentioned, two months before it was on Newsflare: https://youtu.be/XSD7-TgUmUY

If you expand the description, it says to contact ViralHog for licensing. ViralHog is a viral marketing firm. This video was also uploaded to The Chive, probably for similar marketing purposes. 

I'm not saying it wouldn't be wonderful to start seeing colors you couldn't before. I'm saying these glasses won't make you distinguish the red and green as those hues in the Angry Birds movie. I could be wrong, and if I am, sorry to the man for doubting his reaction, but I'm pretty sure this is an ad.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> a. Board is an English word, if they have any other industry-lingo nomenclature that differs than colloquial meaning, they should've stipulated it in the contract, which they didn't. 

Industry standard definition always trumps. 

b. The entire plane not being considered boarded doesn't mean he individually wasn't boarded.

But he can be unboarded involuntarily at any point due to force majeure. Once the airline involuntarily revokes his boarding privilege, he has no right to stay in that seat. It's technically trespass if he doesn't leave in a reasonable period, as well as a violation of FAA regulations. 

A House isn't cleaned before all rooms have been cleaned, that doesn't mean that half way thru some rooms weren't already cleaned.  

But the house isn't cleaned. Similarly, boarding isn't complete. If you're in my home and I revoke your right of entry, you now have to leave, even though you've already entered. Once the license (permission) is revoked, the licensee must leave. Boarding is similar to a license to entry and can be revoked by the licenser (airline) for cause (internal labor/scheduling issue).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Involuntary denial of boarding happens. There is no real negotiation. They get as many people to take the deal as possible, then involuntarily remove the rest at the same deal. The money is honestly just an incentive. There's no present entitlement because the maximum amount they can pay out will depend on what flight they can get him on and when it will arrive. $800 is probably based on the fact that they don't think they can get him there within two hours of his original arrival. The max is $1350, by the way, not $1300, my mistake. And this is no longer a negotiation as to whether he gets to stay on the plane. He may get to negotiate up how much they give him, but he's off that plane due to whatever lottery system they employed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And you'll probably have lawyers argue both ways, but unfortunately, your definition doesn't matter. Their definition (more specifically, the industry's) does. And I strongly doubt any airline will want to consider passengers as "boarded" at any point before they have to. So for the purposes of involuntarily denying boarding, I would imagine that United considers that denial of boarding can happen even after physical boarding has occurred. It's the same as taking back an invitation to enter a space and asking someone to leave after they've entered. The laws of trespass would probably apply. Just because you're comfortable in my house and thought you'd be there for a while doesn't mean I can't kick you out because I have an emergency appointment I have to deal with (not a perfect analogy but you get the idea).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He has physically boarded the plane as in he is currently onboard it. The boarding process is only complete once the doors are closed. The language is specific to the boarding process, not individual boarding. Technically, anyone that enters a plane has boarded it, including maintenance crew. They then leave the plane, deboarding it. This has nothing to do with boarding the plane for the purposes of transit as part of the pre-flight procedure. A plane is fully boarded once everyone is onboard and the doors are closed. At this point, control of the passengers transfers to the pilot and crew. Anyone can be deplaned after boarding has completed for a certain set of reasons. However, the boarding process is not indefinite. The process lasts from when passengers line up to begin boarding until the doors close, at which point no one is allowed on board the plane absent extreme exigency. The only thing that can happen is letting people off, which is not boarding, it's removing. 

This passenger has been involuntarily denied boarding by United, even though he is already on the plane. More to the point, his right to be on the plane has been revoked by the airline to cover their force majeure event, namely, their need to have their crew flown to Louisville to crew another flight. This is covered in the contract of carriage under Rules 24 and 25. Even though he was on the plane (he has boarded) he has subsequently been denied boarding (been asked to leave involuntarily). At this point he, by law, has to leave per FAA regulations. He can appeal and complain and never fly United again, but he cannot stay on that plane. United had the right to call the police to deplane him and exercised it. 

He can feel free to litigate this claim, which he'll probably lose, or he can proceed with the other claims, where he has a much higher chance of winning. The law and morals don't always line up. This is one of those cases so while we may agree United is in the wrong, they have no legal liability here for simply revoking his boarding privileges.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The common definition would be the industry definition. 

Wikipedia: "Boarding starts with entering the vehicle and ends with the seating of each passenger and closure of thedoors." 

I strongly doubt any airline would dispute that definition because anything else would mean they are responsible for passenger conduct while the plane is not in transit. 

Also, the concept of when an individual has boarded and when the boarding process is complete are two separate concepts. One can occur before the other.  

Sort of. Just because you've boarded doesn't mean you now own that seat for the transit. You can be deboarded/deplaned for cause. Boarding had not completed at the time the passenger was asked to give up his seat because there were still passengers waiting to board, namely the flight crew taking his seat. United will likely argue they had cause to deboard the passenger and will, if we're being real, win on that point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah but if he bought the ticket through United, that's where the passenger's contract lies and any subrogation is United's problem. I'm sure there's a vicarious liability clause in the Republic-United contract.

<TEXT> Hi top comment! I'm gonna hijack you like a United passenger because I wanna point out that this bestofed comment is also wrong. It's not illegal for them to remove the passenger at random from the plane to address a labor issue (namely getting their crew to a flight at another airport). Legally, they're in the clear. By common definition, boarding is only completed when the doors are closed and as the poor man was clearly able to reenter the plane, boarding was not completed. Just because their crew is technically flying standby doesn't mean that their crew is denied priority to make it to the Louisville flight. It's in their contract of carriage as part of voluntary/involuntary delays due to force majeure. As long as they provide reasonable compensation and get the passenger to the destination within a reasonable period after the original ticketed arrival time, they're clear. They're not good people for handling it this way, but they're legally alright. 

The cops, on the other hand, are looking at a law suit for excessive force and dragging him off the plane. In addition, the airport and United will probably get sued for not attending to him after he had his head banged. Not to mention the FAA is likely going to want to know how someone who was removed from a plane was so easily able to get back on it.  </TEXT>

It was an ad lib with consequences. When he roars in grief and frustration at not finding Merry and Pippin, more than a little of that is pain. 

Sean lacerated his foot when he was wading into the river at the scene at the end of The Fellowship of the Rings where Sam chases after Frodo while Frodo is rowing to the other bank to head to Mordor alone. He stepped on a piece of glass in the riverbed. When he cries out as he nearly drowns trying to get to Frodo, some tears were pain tears. 

I believe these injury takes were used in the final cut. Additional fun facts, when Aragorn knocks the knife out of the air that the Uruk-Hai leader throws at him after Aragorn finds Boromir at the end of Fellowship, that's real. He nearly got hit. The Uruk-Hai actor threw a real knife way too close and Viggo had to react and block the knife with his sword. Also, the charge of the Rohirrim on Pelennor Fields involved finding pretty much every available horse in New Zealand that could be transported to that spot and filming them charging.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rule ~~23~~ 24 or 25 under the CoC. Specifically addresses labor shortages and can easily be read to include this situation. This isn't a regular standby passenger, this is four members of a flight crew that needed to get to the airport and probably had union stipulations as to how that can occur. This typically happens by flying them standby but end of the day, even though the labor issue is internal to United, they're allowed to take your seat to get them where they need to go, provided they make reasonable efforts to get you to your destination as well, which, technically, they did. United has the right to appropriate seats on its own plane to transport its own crew to address a labor shortage. Once he was ordered off the plane and refused, their action in calling the cops was appropriate under federal law. The police most likely used excessive force, but a woman being distressed on camera and a video that doesn't actually capture how the injury occurred are not enough to establish excessive force. Passenger testimony might.   </TEXT>

No, because they're required to get you there within a reasonable time of your scheduled arrival. They're not required to get you there exactly when the ticket says you'll arrive. So if they can't accommodate getting you there within a reasonable period given the circumstances, then you have a case. That case will also be a goldmine. 

Again, though, the implication of what you're saying is that nobody who has to be in a certain place at a certain time should take a risk with flying an airline. Ever. 

Sure. Weather that prevents flying happens and can ground flights for a week. You're not the only person who had to fly that day and rebooking is going to be a nightmare given a limited number of planes and pilots plus people who have previously booked flights for after planes can fly again. That's not on them, that's on you. I'm not saying this situation is in actuality analogous, but contractually and legally, it's basically the same. 

Shit happens and people get stuck. It happens to doctors who need to see patients just like it happens to people in other professions. Everything you do is a calculated risk. Airlines can't bump you indefinitely, but they're legally allowed to overbook and legally allowed to bump you based on internal criteria, as long as they get you to the destination within a certain time frame. If you have a problem with that, take it up with Congress and the FAA. Seriously. Obama actually championed regulations about exactly this that were passed and appear to have been gently and quietly rolled back. 

The harsh truth of lawyering is that what is legal and what is right are not necessarily the same thing. This is one of those cases.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hard to say without meeting the client (I'm also not an Illinois lawyer so I'm not sure on their tort law). In terms of general strategy, I'd feel comfortable sending demand letters to both threatening litigation. United could have handled this in a much better way. I'd ask for a little higher than reasonable and we'd probably settle for reasonable or just under. The police would be a better case, but I'd have to get other passengers to testify and I'd have to prove him getting hit on the head wasn't an accident. 

Now, there's an interesting case for damages from the injury and possibly leaving him unattended after the injury in such a way that he could get back on the plane. I'd think the airport, police, and United would be jointly and severally liable for that (a high degree of negligence). Of course, this all depends on facts we don't have. But *that* claim is the real lawsuit and where he'll get his money. 

As always, none of this is a substitute for talking to a lawyer and none of this I've said should be construed as legal advice.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> To make the suit go away? Probably in the tens of thousands at most. Legally, they're in the clear. Sadly, laws and morals are not the same. 

I'm a lawyer and can claim I have an important hearing the next day to decide a death penalty case, but absent proof, I'm SoL. Merely needing to get back to do his job, absent some further showing of need, is not enough to justify him being on that specific flight.  

PD might settle for much more because of use of excessive force, but that's a high bar.  

Edit: Worth noting that unless the airline is aware of some time sensitive issue and agrees to accommodate it, like transportation of an organ or knowingly transporting someone for life saving treatment, it's up to the doctor to get home on time and manage his schedule, not the airline. He may be right and have to see patients, but that doesn't mean the airline is required to go above and beyond unless they want to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably not many actually. Assuming the people removing the doctor were cops, they're the ones with the real problem (unless United's manager lied about why the guy was being removed). United is facing a PR nightmare, a lawsuit for damages related to being forced to reschedule, and a drop in business. However, they'll likely win on the rescheduling if it goes to trial. 

The common carrier rules only sort of apply because when you buy a ticket, you agree to the possibility you might be bumped. Most likely any lawsuit would involve shared liability and the police department that removed the plaintiff. Illinois has a joint and severable liability statute which will apply. 

However, to make it go away, United will settle. The PD will too, probably.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fair point. I should have clarified and said "will make the predators endangered."

There is minimal livestock in Alaska. It's not a thing that people are overly concerned with and farmers already have the ability to shoot wolves that are harassing their livestock. With people, again, attacks and rare and typically do not occur in the cities. Again, when they happen, people are allowed to kill the animal in self defense. You're more in danger of being attacked by a moose in Anchorage than a bear or wolf. The black bears tend to run away and wolves don't come into town. Same for the rest of the state. The only pets that get attacked are off leash. It almost never happens that a predator will attack a leashed animal with a human and if it does, that predator is hunted down. 

There is a natural predator prey balance. Their numbers rise and fall through a regular cycle. The government of Alaska inflated prey numbers to ensure ample hunting for people from the lower 48 by, in turn, culling the predator population. They are not a threat to humans in the Bush and the ones that are get taken care of. This purely about profit from hunting licenses.  

On a tangential note, keeping prey population this high is really not great for the tundra.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually did live there and worked on this exact issue. Wolves were not and are still not some massive existential threat to life in the Bush. You are legally allowed to kill a wolf to protect yourself. The wolves that came into Fairbanks and Nome and other communities were killed because they were a threat to the human population. Board of Game routinely kills predators that pose a risk to human populations and everyone's fine with it except when they (routinely) kill the wrong animal. Wolves tend to stay away from popular areas anyway.

Nice strawman with the endangered species argument, by the way. Remind me where my post had anything to do with that? I was discussing hunting practices and that per fair chase, many hunters dislike denning and aerial hunting. Especially when it comes to denning cubs.  </TEXT>

Actually read Gorsuch's dissent. He effectively rewrote the facts to suit a narrative that the trucker had the "safe" option to stay in the truck in below freezing temperatures with no working heat. By Gorsuch's standard, he could stay or walk away, but he could not unhitch the cab and drive away, even if driving away was the only safe option. He could not drive the truck with the trailer hitched, hence why he was stuck to begin with. And he was losing feeling. 


The law was specially designed to protect employees in a situation such as this. Even though the employer did not permit truckers to unhitch the trailer and drive away, exigency is a real thing and is often a defense. The fact that Gorsuch couldn't see this is a failing. It's exactly what people talk about when they discuss activist judges that are so far removed from the consequences of their decisions. His logical basis only works if you ignore the fact that life or death situations arise and require exceptions. A trucker has not signed a contract to die for his or her cargo. 


From Gorsuch's actual dissent:

It might be fair to ask whether TransAms decision was a wise or kind one. 
But its not our job to answer questions like that. Our only task is to decide
whether the decision was an illegal one. The Department of Labor says that
TransAm violated federal law, in particular 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(B). But that
statute only forbids employers from firing employees who refuse[] to operate a
vehicle out of safety concerns. And, of course, nothing like that happened here. 
The trucker in this case wasnt fired for *refusing to operate his vehicle*. Indeed,
his employer gave him the very option the statute says it must: once he voiced
safety concerns, TransAm expressly  and by everyones admission  permitted
him to sit and remain where he was and wait for help. The trucker was fired only
after he declined the statutorily protected option (refuse to operate) and chose
instead to operate his vehicle in a manner he thought wise but his employer did not. And theres simply no law anyone has pointed us to giving employees the
right to operate their vehicles in ways their employers forbid. Maybe the
Department would like such a law, maybe someday Congress will adorn our
federal statute books with such a law. But it isnt there yet. And it isnt our job
to write one  or to allow the Department to write one in Congresss place.

First off, this is pedantic, but I don't like judges using contractions in decisions. It's lazy and unprofessional (hypocrisy is noted), but it's not a substantive criticism. Secondly, exigent circumstances dictate that sometimes the facts on the ground require breaking with company policy to save a life. However, employees shouldn't be penalized for taking action to save themselves when they are in danger of freezing to death. In fact, that's the entire point of 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(B). Strict textualism completely misses this and means that you now have to create laws that will cover every possible scenario, a sheer impossibility. 

In fact, the way the other two justices got around the "operate a vehicle" question is by using the *Chevron* standard. 

Because we are reviewing the DOLs
interpretation of a statute it administers, we begin by asking whether Congress
has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. 
Here, the term operate is not defined in the statute. If . . . Congress has not
directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose
its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an
administrative interpretation. Id. at 843 (footnote omitted). Instead, we examine
whether the agencys [interpretation] is based on a permissible construction of
the statute. Id.

TransAms argument equates the term operate, as used in the statute,
with driving. **However, TransAm has not directed this court to any authority for
the proposition that Congress intended the refusal-to-operate provision of the STAA to be interpreted so narrowly, and has not explained how such a narrow
interpretation furthers the purposes of the STAA.** The ARB interpreted the term
operate to encompass not only driving, but other uses of a vehicle when it is
within the control of the employee.^3
Thus, under the ARBs interpretation, the
refusal-to-operate provision could cover a situation in which an employee refuses
to use his vehicle in the manner directed by his employer even if that refusal
results in the employee driving the vehicle. Thus, by way of example, an
employee who partially unloads an overweight trailer in direct contravention of
his employers instruction to continue pulling the overweight trailer on the public
roadways, has refused to operate the vehicle for purposes of the STAA even if the
employee completes the trip after unloading the trailer. See Beveridge v. Waste
Stream Envtl., Inc., ARB No. 97-137, 1997 WL 806522, at *1 (ARB Dec. 23,
1997). Similarly, an employee who moves a disabled trailer from the middle of a
busy roadway to the shoulder of the road after being told by his employer to
remain in the roadway, has refused to operate his vehicle for purposes of the
STAA whistle-blower protection under the interpretation of  31105(a)(1)(B)(ii)
adopted by the ARB.

Emphasis added. 

Now let's look at the purpose of this law, in particular 49 U.S.C.  31100(2): 

The purpose of this subchapter is to ensure that the Secretary, States, and other political jurisdictions work in partnership to establish programs to improve motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety to support a safe and efficient transportation system by(2) **increasing administrative flexibility** and developing and enforcing effective, compatible, and cost-beneficial motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety regulations and practices, including improving enforcement of State and local traffic safety laws and regulations;

The ARB specifically exists to interpret and enforce this and related laws. It's part of the delegation of executive authority and the understanding that agencies exist to interpret and execute the law in a fair and equitable fashion (YMMV). 

The ARBs interpretation of  31105(a)(1)(B)(ii)
furthers the purpose of the STAA by prohibiting an employer from discharging an
insubordinate employee whose insubordination was motivated by the employees
reasonable apprehension of serious injury to himself or members of the public. 
Thus, we defer to the DOLs interpretation that the term operate as used in
 31105(a)(1)(B) is not coextensive with the term drive.^4

Now footnote 4 is especially pretty. 

^4
The dissent takes issue with our application of Chevron to the question
before us, deeming it an uninvited foray into step two of Chevronland. 
Dissenting Op. at 2. We received our invitation from TransAm in its opening
brief. Appellant Br. at 13 n.5. TransAm, the appellant in this matter, relied on
Chevron to argue the ARBs construction of the STAA should be rejected. 

The dissent further criticizes us for moving to the second prong of the
Chevron analysis after concluding the term operate is not defined in the statute. 
The dissent believes Congresss intent can be easily determined by simply
choosing a favorite dictionary definition of the word and applying that to quickly
conclude the statute is not ambiguous at all. However, in addition to not defining
the term operate, Congress also did not unambiguously express its intent with
regard to the definition of the term. See United States v. Seminole Nation of
Okla., 321 F.3d 939, 944 (10th Cir. 2002). **Thus, the only way to resolve the
matter we have been asked by TransAm to review is to move to Chevrons second
step.**

Even if we disregard TransAms request that we analyze this case using the
Chevron paradigm and employ the analysis used by the dissent, we would still
reach the same conclusion. We, too, have found a dictionary definition of the word operate and discovered it means to control the functioning of. Operate,
Oxford Dictionaries Pro,
http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/operate (last
visited July 8, 2016). This definition clearly encompasses activities other than
driving. **For that reason, the dissents conclusion that a truck driver is
operating his truck when he refuses to drive it but not when he refuses to
remain in control of it while awaiting its repair, is curious. The only logical
explanation is that the dissent has concluded Congress used the word operate in
the statute when it really meant drive.** We are more comfortable limiting our
review to the language Congress actually used. As the dissenting judge stated
during oral argument, Our job isnt to legislate and add new words that arent
present in the statute.

Emphasis mine. A true smack down on Gorsuch claiming strict textualism. 

Because the refusal-to-operate provision can be interpreted to cover
multiple uses of a vehicle while it is in the control of an employee, the ARB did
not err in concluding that Maddins act of unhitching the trailer and driving off in
the truck was a refusal to operate the tractor-trailer for purposes of
 31105(a)(1)(B)(ii). Maddin was instructed by Mr. Cluck to operate his rig by
remaining with the trailer until the repairperson arrived. He disobeyed that
instruction and drove off in the truck, leaving the trailer behind. Thus, as the
ARB concluded, although Maddin actually drove the truck after unhitching it, he
refused to operate his tractor-trailer in the manner instructed by his employer. 
This conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.

<TEXT> That's...actually not wrong. Shredded cheese goes bad quicker, unless you buy the stuff that's treated to last longer shredded, which is not the best for everyone. Cheese isn't exactly a panacea on its own, but buying a block and shredding it yourself is actually better since you'll have cheese for longer. 

That said, Vermont is the superior cheese producing state.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually read Gorsuch's dissent. He effectively rewrote the facts to suit a narrative that the trucker had the "safe" option to stay in the truck in below freezing temperatures with no working heat. By Gorsuch's standard, he could stay or walk away, but he could not unhitch the cab and drive away, even if driving away was the only safe option. He could not drive the truck with the trailer hitched, hence why he was stuck to begin with. And he was losing feeling. 

The law was specially designed to protect employees in a situation such as this. Even though the employer did not permit truckers to unhitch the trailer and drive away, exigency is a real thing and is often a defense. The fact that Gorsuch couldn't see this is a failing. It's exactly what people talk about when they discuss activist judges that are so far removed from the consequences of their decisions. His logical basis only works if you ignore the fact that life or death situations arise and require exceptions. A trucker has not signed a contract to die for his or her cargo.  

Edit: Here's some more I posted elsewhere. 

From Gorsuch's actual dissent:

It might be fair to ask whether TransAms decision was a wise or kind one. 
But its not our job to answer questions like that. Our only task is to decide
whether the decision was an illegal one. The Department of Labor says that
TransAm violated federal law, in particular 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(B). But that
statute only forbids employers from firing employees who refuse[] to operate a
vehicle out of safety concerns. And, of course, nothing like that happened here. 
The trucker in this case wasnt fired for *refusing to operate his vehicle*. Indeed,
his employer gave him the very option the statute says it must: once he voiced
safety concerns, TransAm expressly  and by everyones admission  permitted
him to sit and remain where he was and wait for help. The trucker was fired only
after he declined the statutorily protected option (refuse to operate) and chose
instead to operate his vehicle in a manner he thought wise but his employer did not. And theres simply no law anyone has pointed us to giving employees the
right to operate their vehicles in ways their employers forbid. Maybe the
Department would like such a law, maybe someday Congress will adorn our
federal statute books with such a law. But it isnt there yet. And it isnt our job
to write one  or to allow the Department to write one in Congresss place.

First off, this is pedantic, but I don't like judges using contractions in decisions. It's lazy and unprofessional (hypocrisy is noted), but it's not a substantive criticism. Secondly, exigent circumstances dictate that sometimes the facts on the ground require breaking with company policy to save a life. However, employees shouldn't be penalized for taking action to save themselves when they are in danger of freezing to death. In fact, that's the entire point of 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(B). Strict textualism completely misses this and means that you now have to create laws that will cover every possible scenario, a sheer impossibility. 

In fact, the way the other two justices got around the "operate a vehicle" question is by using the *Chevron* standard. 

Because we are reviewing the DOLs
interpretation of a statute it administers, we begin by asking whether Congress
has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. 
Here, the term operate is not defined in the statute. If . . . Congress has not
directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose
its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an
administrative interpretation. Id. at 843 (footnote omitted). Instead, we examine
whether the agencys [interpretation] is based on a permissible construction of
the statute. Id.

TransAms argument equates the term operate, as used in the statute,
with driving. **However, TransAm has not directed this court to any authority for
the proposition that Congress intended the refusal-to-operate provision of the STAA to be interpreted so narrowly, and has not explained how such a narrow
interpretation furthers the purposes of the STAA.** The ARB interpreted the term
operate to encompass not only driving, but other uses of a vehicle when it is
within the control of the employee.^3
Thus, under the ARBs interpretation, the
refusal-to-operate provision could cover a situation in which an employee refuses
to use his vehicle in the manner directed by his employer even if that refusal
results in the employee driving the vehicle. Thus, by way of example, an
employee who partially unloads an overweight trailer in direct contravention of
his employers instruction to continue pulling the overweight trailer on the public
roadways, has refused to operate the vehicle for purposes of the STAA even if the
employee completes the trip after unloading the trailer. See Beveridge v. Waste
Stream Envtl., Inc., ARB No. 97-137, 1997 WL 806522, at *1 (ARB Dec. 23,
1997). Similarly, an employee who moves a disabled trailer from the middle of a
busy roadway to the shoulder of the road after being told by his employer to
remain in the roadway, has refused to operate his vehicle for purposes of the
STAA whistle-blower protection under the interpretation of  31105(a)(1)(B)(ii)
adopted by the ARB.

Emphasis added. 

Now let's look at the purpose of this law, in particular 49 U.S.C.  31100(2): 

The purpose of this subchapter is to ensure that the Secretary, States, and other political jurisdictions work in partnership to establish programs to improve motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety to support a safe and efficient transportation system by(2) **increasing administrative flexibility** and developing and enforcing effective, compatible, and cost-beneficial motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety regulations and practices, including improving enforcement of State and local traffic safety laws and regulations;

The ARB specifically exists to interpret and enforce this and related laws. It's part of the delegation of executive authority and the understanding that agencies exist to interpret and execute the law in a fair and equitable fashion (YMMV). 

The ARBs interpretation of  31105(a)(1)(B)(ii)
furthers the purpose of the STAA by prohibiting an employer from discharging an
insubordinate employee whose insubordination was motivated by the employees
reasonable apprehension of serious injury to himself or members of the public. 
Thus, we defer to the DOLs interpretation that the term operate as used in
 31105(a)(1)(B) is not coextensive with the term drive.^4

Now footnote 4 is especially pretty. 

^4
The dissent takes issue with our application of Chevron to the question
before us, deeming it an uninvited foray into step two of Chevronland. 
Dissenting Op. at 2. We received our invitation from TransAm in its opening
brief. Appellant Br. at 13 n.5. TransAm, the appellant in this matter, relied on
Chevron to argue the ARBs construction of the STAA should be rejected. 

The dissent further criticizes us for moving to the second prong of the
Chevron analysis after concluding the term operate is not defined in the statute. 
The dissent believes Congresss intent can be easily determined by simply
choosing a favorite dictionary definition of the word and applying that to quickly
conclude the statute is not ambiguous at all. However, in addition to not defining
the term operate, Congress also did not unambiguously express its intent with
regard to the definition of the term. See United States v. Seminole Nation of
Okla., 321 F.3d 939, 944 (10th Cir. 2002). **Thus, the only way to resolve the
matter we have been asked by TransAm to review is to move to Chevrons second
step.**

Even if we disregard TransAms request that we analyze this case using the
Chevron paradigm and employ the analysis used by the dissent, we would still
reach the same conclusion. We, too, have found a dictionary definition of the word operate and discovered it means to control the functioning of. Operate,
Oxford Dictionaries Pro,
http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/operate (last
visited July 8, 2016). This definition clearly encompasses activities other than
driving. **For that reason, the dissents conclusion that a truck driver is
operating his truck when he refuses to drive it but not when he refuses to
remain in control of it while awaiting its repair, is curious. The only logical
explanation is that the dissent has concluded Congress used the word operate in
the statute when it really meant drive.** We are more comfortable limiting our
review to the language Congress actually used. As the dissenting judge stated
during oral argument, Our job isnt to legislate and add new words that arent
present in the statute.

Emphasis mine. A true smack down on Gorsuch claiming strict textualism. 

Because the refusal-to-operate provision can be interpreted to cover
multiple uses of a vehicle while it is in the control of an employee, the ARB did
not err in concluding that Maddins act of unhitching the trailer and driving off in
the truck was a refusal to operate the tractor-trailer for purposes of
 31105(a)(1)(B)(ii). Maddin was instructed by Mr. Cluck to operate his rig by
remaining with the trailer until the repairperson arrived. He disobeyed that
instruction and drove off in the truck, leaving the trailer behind. Thus, as the
ARB concluded, although Maddin actually drove the truck after unhitching it, he
refused to operate his tractor-trailer in the manner instructed by his employer. 
This conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.

<TEXT> Because most cases aren't actually all that contentious. Most cases actually have a majority of judges/justices going the same way on appeal, with a few differences on how the law should work to get there. It's the ones where there is an actual ideological difference on how the law should work with radical affects on outcome and real world implications where the makeup of the court matters. Again, Frozen Trucker is the perfect example because it shows the failing of strict textualism: inequitable results, which is in antithesis to the concept of a justice system. 

It's like the Westboro Baptist Church case about protesting a soldier's funeral. Basically unanimous for WBC. Alito's dissent basically said it bordered on fighting words or hate speech. But even the hard core liberals recognized WBC had the First Amendment on their side.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a practice called denning. It's widely condemned because it completely ignores the "fair chase" rule. Alaska got in a bit of trouble because the Board of Game under Palin was allowed to kill denning wolf cubs. Since it's technically not denning if they're outside the den, they'd lure the parents out, kill them, claim they couldn't find a zoo for the cubs, then kill the cubs. 

This is also around when the aerial wolf hunting campaign started. Bullshit practice. Hunters I know in Alaska claimed that it leveled the playing field because by the time they got close enough to shoot, the wolf could smell them and run away. My theory was these guys just suck at hunting and love killing them with an even greater advantage.

Bin Laden founded al Qaeda which was responsible for the attack. 

Bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on June 24, 1998.The1998 U.S. Embassy bombingswere a series of attacks that occurred on August 7, 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneoustruck bombexplosions at the United Statesembassiesin the major East African cities ofDar es Salaam, Tanzania andNairobi, Kenya. The attacks were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the United States public for the first time, and resulted in the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation placing bin Laden on itsTen Most Wantedlist.

.  .  . 

At the end of 2000,Richard Clarkerevealed that Islamic militants headed by bin Laden had planned atriple attack on January 3, 2000, which would have included bombings in Jordan of theRadisson SAS HotelinAmmanand tourists atMount Neboand a site on theJordan River, the sinking of the destroyerUSSThe Sullivansin Yemen, as well as an attack on a target within the United States. The plan was foiled by the arrest of the Jordanian terrorist cell, the sinking of the explosive-filled skiff intended to target the destroyer, and the arrest ofAhmed Ressam.

<TEXT> A White House official said that Bannon was placed on the committee in part to monitor Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and never attended a meeting. Hes no longer needed with McMaster in charge of the council, the official said.

Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13 for not disclosing to the president or to Vice President Mike Pence the extent of his conversations with Russias ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, before Trumps inauguration.

Which, of course, means that either they're lying or they knew Flynn was a security risk but went ahead with it anyway. All while taking the joint chiefs out.

The United States has announced a shift in its diplomatic policy on Syria and is no longer insisting that its president Bashar al-Assad be removed as the head of the war-torn country.

In a clear departure from the Obama administration's stance on Assad, and against EU policy, the US is now moving its focus to its battle with Isis.

Based on the Trump administration's statements as to who to blame and why, and Trump's actions, the only logical conclusion is that these chemical weapons attacks by the Assad regime on Syrian citizens is the fault of Donald Trump and his policymakers.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the last administration's weakness and irresolution, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a 'red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing.

<TEXT> Interagency intelligence sharing was started under Bush in reaction to 9/11, especially with the 2004 intelligence reform act. Obama did, yes, reauthorize the PATRIOT Act 3 times, including the expansion to narcoterrorism. But significant protections were also put in place under Obama that didn't exist under Bush and are now once again being stripped away under Trump. 

Spying is a fact of life if you want to have any kind of society in the modern world. But this "both sides are equally bad" rhetoric that keeps being spouted is patent bullshit. Obama did a lot of terrible things but he is by no means as bad as Bush or Trump. Not even close.  </TEXT>

Because, if you really think about it, there probably weren't that many cameras on it in the first place and in 2001, it's possible they weren't storing the data off site. Even if they were, security camera footage would be low priority. The cameras on the Pentagon were likely destroyed by having a plane hit them. Flying a plane into it is not great for the structural integrity or storage capabilities of a device. The cameras aren't capturing the other side of the building, they tend to film the side of the building they're on, thus any that captured it would have been hit. They Pentagon also generally frowns on cameras being pointed at it, so there probably weren't many outside cameras filming the incident. No one had cell phone cameras at the time and only tourists and news crews carry video recording devices, neither of which was likely recording the Pentagon because, in all honesty, it's a pretty boring building. No one would be generally filming the sky because why would they? There are 3 airfields nearby (Bolling AFB, National, and Dulles) plus two others nearby in Maryland (Andrews AFB and BWI). So a plane near the Pentagon isn't unusual. 


All this to say, to have video of the plane flying into the Pentagon, you'd need to have a camera pointed at the sky focusing on the correct plane that wasn't on the Pentagon. The chances of this happening are very fucking low.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pentagon had spent years reinforcing the building, but hadn't finished the process yet. Just spitballing but I'm assuming the exact specifications of the structural improvements are a secret. Having pictures of those structural changes because the building has a massive hole in it is not exactly in their best interests. You can determine a lot from a picture and it would not behoove the Pentagon to have pictures of its internal structure and construction details out and about.  </TEXT>

So yeah, you're not going to see pictures of all the parts on the lawn because most of the plane went inside where it was contained and burned for hours, incinerating most of it. Structural integrity would be lost at far lower temperatures than the melting point of titanium.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Am a lawyer. Immunity grants, in these kinds of situations, typically come with conditions and it's almost never a blank check. It's usually immunity from any crimes related to the incident in question. Immunity implicitly means you're waiving the Fifth, though you usually sign an explicit waiver (unless you get a deal where the statements can't be used against you if the immunity is later withdrawn, which often happens). The immunity is in exchange for honesty and testimony, so if you lie or omit anything or refuse to do anything the prosecutor asks, the immunity can be withdrawn and you better believe all those statements you made will be used to prosecute you through parallel construction. Immunity keeps you out of jail, but you become the government's bitch and you're probably going to be looking over your shoulder the rest of your life because you snitched and did no time. 

It's not unusual in cases like this to request immunity, even if the defendant has nothing. It's basically a negotiation tactic, signalling that you possibly have information to trade if you get to walk.   </TEXT>

No one knows because we don't have an actual popular vote count. 

And when are Dems planning on changing their delegate system. The DNC unity reform commission hasn't done shit about it.  

Probably because the DNC chair election just happened and the committee is still not fully staffed. It needs time to actually, you know, exist first. Not that I have much hope for it, but at least it's a step in the right direction.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dems don't actually like superdelegates either. Or did you not pay attention to the shitshow that was the Democratic primary?  

And Clinton won the popular vote of the states that were actually counted.  Iowa, Maine, Nevada, and Washington didn't release popular vote results so no idea if they made up the difference. The count included Florida, which neither Clinton nor Obama contested, and Michigan, where Obama withdrew from the ballot yet Clinton did not. DNC penalized Florida and Michigan for violating party rules.

Basically, we have no idea what the actual popular vote totals were in the 2008 Democratic Primary, but we do know the two candidates were within 1% of each other on popular vote, within the margin of error.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure I can agree with that. Insurance isn't really for the healthy no matter what though. It's always going to be a burden to them. The mandate did drive up costs. My point is more that the extent to which it did has little to do with the bill and more to do with Republicans saying fuck you and insurers taking advantage and also saying fuck you because they are now required to assume more risk.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's fair. I think of the ACA as a bandaid. And costs really were spiraling out of control already. Keep in mind that a lot of what's driving up costs is that a lot more people can actually afford healthcare. Before, they couldn't afford to go to the doctor. We lived in a society where it was relatively inexpensive for someone with insurance because the pool was those that could afford it. Now the pool is bigger. Someone's gotta take that burden. The public option would have heavily mitigated this, but alas.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> And if the state doesn't take it on, those costs get passed directly to you, what a savings! Seriously though, Tennessee did the budget math so the Medicaid expansion would be an unquantifiable debt. Also, every state except Vermont has a balanced budget provision. That's an excuse, not a real reason. You were already paying the millions in upkeep, you just don't remember how fast your insurance rates were rising. You were paying for it privately rather than publicly.  </TEXT>

Meanwhile, Obamacare is the only thing keeping healthcare in Arizona afloat. Can you even imagine what would happen if that bandaid were removed?

<TEXT> Because Ted Kennedy died, Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson are assholes, and Martha Coakley can't run a campaign to save her life. 

Reconciliation couldn't fix this due to the Byrd rule, because the amendments you're suggesting would fall under entitlements. You'd need the 60 votes, and Scott Brown winning Massachusetts was the straw that killed the attempt to force the amendments later. Keep in mind Republicans signed a fucking pledge to get Grover Norquist's money refusing to increase taxes. Even if it was for something as beneficial to every American as healthcare reform. They couldn't stand the idea of Obama being the guy who saved healthcare, so they gutted it, shat on it, and Dems salvaged what they could, but it was lost. Dems only had a supermajority for a few weeks and Harry Reid and Obama ignorantly thought that they could get Republicans on board. The level of obstruction was literally impossible to foresee unless you go in assuming Republicans are racist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obamacare makes relatively healthy people skip preventative care because of the cost, it's shit because insurance companies were involved forcing us to pay for shit we'll never need and not capping costs.  

Preventive care is free under Obamacare. Diagnosis is not. Getting a physical is free. Getting a physical but then mentioning something unrelated will lead to the visit being charged as a normal diagnostic visit. Interestingly, this is because doctors figured out how to ask questions to change the visit from a wellness check to a diagnostic visit, allowing them to bill it differently. One of those protections that was stripped out of the bill. I'll admit I don't like it either, but people put far too much blame on Obamacare and not nearly enough on the fuckwits upcharging for the same services and blaming Obama. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Insurance companies are leaving Michigan, so there's less competition, driving up prices. Had there been a public option like the Dems wanted, the premium spikes wouldn't have been nearly so severe.

In recent years, however, premiums have jumped  including by 17% in the last year as the number of insurers offering plans has declined. In many cases, those increases are covered by federal subsidies,reducing the impact on individuals  but those subsidies must be borne by taxpayers.

http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/13/obamacare-replacement-hits-michigans-working-poor-hardest/99142552/

Keep in mind that even with these jumps in premiums, if there was no ACA, premiums would have been far higher. 

http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-obamacare-premiums-20160726-snap-story,amp.html

Forbes has a dissenting article that's worth reading, but I think it delves too far into the way it was without really looking at projections. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/07/28/overwhelming-evidence-that-obamacare-caused-premiums-to-increase-substantially/amp/

Finally, over a million more people in Michigan have insurance that didn't have it before. For some these people, who can now afford healthcare and were previously going without, this is life or death. Remember that one of the biggest changes in the ACA was an insurer couldn't deny coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions. Prior to enactment, you could be dropped for having whatever the insurer defined as a preexisting condition. Your premiums have gone up, but people you know with cancer and *diabetes* can now afford healthcare.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What state are you in/who do you work for? I can almost guarantee it's because either your state is fucking you over or your company is because they didn't like the bill to begin with. They "can't afford" the hit so they're passing it on to you. Which is obviously wrong. 

Face it we're paying more for monthly rates and getting extremely shittier coverage, it used to be a viable option to visit the ER if there was an issue. Now it's wait till the Dr is open on Monday since it will cost close to $3k to just walk into the ER. 

Well, maybe don't go to the ER unless you have an actual emergency. Shit like that was viable, but definitely contributed to the costs spiraling out of control. 

Not to mention all the increased paperwork we have to keep track of and keep on file with our Dr. 

That was going to happen no matter what as doctors are trying to integrate all records systems so patient care can go from doc to doc and things don't get missed in the records. We started upgrading our systems right around when the ACA was implemented, so makes sense that they're conflated, but they're not really related. This additional paperwork does have a purpose.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was working in the Senate at the time. Healthcare was my issue. I read the entire bill front to back several times as I'd often get asked about particular sections by constituents. My favorites were the ones that would say they've read the whole thing and talk about a specific provision that I knew didn't exist. So I'd ask them to tell me where it is, but they couldn't, but they were sure it was in there because of Fox News and a small but growing outfit known as Breitbart. One of the darkest days in my office was when the public option died. The three of us on healthcare (me, an LC, and an LA) along with a couple other interns who had worked their asses off promoting this thing were given 30 minutes to mope by the Chief of Staff, then it was back to work.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> That tracks. Georgia turned down the federal subsidies that were offered to the states to prevent/mitigate exactly what happened to you. Keep in mind this was essentially free money from the Feds to reign in healthcare costs and Georgia said no. Most of the people who report their premiums rising like yours did live in states that refused the subsidies. The ACA itself didn't hurt you (though it originally had protections against this that were stripped by Republicans in 2009). It's Georgia refusing to implement it properly and turning down money as a fuck you, in addition to the insurance companies taking advantage of this, that's biting you.

Mr. Trump, in a telephone interview moments after the bill was pulled, blamed Democrats and predicted that they would seek a deal within a year after, he asserted, Obamacare explodes because of higher premiums. The president said he did not fault Mr. Ryan and said that he was pleased to move past his first legislative fight. He maintained that he was merely going along with the House bill.

No, Trump. This is your failure. You get to own this along with Ryan and the rest of the GOP.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Uses the ideal gas law to spectacular effect. PV=nRT. From this you see that pressure (P) and temperature (T) are directly proportional. Therefore, by increasing pressure using a fixed volume container and a liquid that will expand as it gets hotter (phase change), you naturally increase the pressure. Normally as you increase temperature in an open container like a sauce pot, this won't happen and the liquid will evaporate (decreasing "n" or the amount of stuff in the container). "T" is inversely proportional to "n" (and in case you're curious, "R" is the constant and doesn't matter for our purposes, but is PV/nT).

So in a pressure cooker, you have a situation where P must increase, due to the liquid becoming a gas in the sealed container after it rises above its boiling point (assume 100C or 212F and the liquid is water, it'll be around there anyway). Because the pressure is increasing at temperatures over 100C, and pressure and temperature are directly proportional, you don't need the temperature to be as high to cook the food in the same amount of time (so you can achieve "high temperature effects" with food at a lower temperature that would typically burn at a higher temperature in an open container). Furthermore (and more to the point of how a pressure cooker is used) if you raise the temperature to the level at which you usually cook the food, it will require less time to cook than it normally would at that temperature. This is not ideal for things that already don't require a lot of time, like sauting or frying, but it's useful for something like stock or soup or braising, where you hold a thing at temperature for a long time to extract flavor or break it down. 

Going back to rice, by putting it under pressure, you can cook it much faster. This is basically a more extreme version of putting the lid on the pot and letting it simmer till done. Also, due to the nature of a pressure cooker, it's nearly impossible to screw it up and overcook the rice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 57-year-old radio jock allegedly filled out ex-wife Kelly Curtis' mail-in ballot for the 2016 presidential election, forged her signature  and then stuck it in the mail, the criminal complaint states.

. . . 

Curtis' ex inadvertently tipped off elections officials to the potential fraud when she called from her new home in South Carolina to find out if she could vote there while still registered in Colorado.

"Ms. Curtis called to ask how she could vote and an election worker informed Ms. Curtis that her voter record had shown she already returned her mail ballot," Weld County Clerk and Recorder Carly Koppes wrote in an email to NBC News.

Koppes, who is also a Republican, wrote they alerted the authorities after concluding "the signature was questionable."

He's looking at 3 years jail and a $5,000 fine. Hypocritical moron.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lawyer hired by the family of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian whistleblower who died in jail, has been injured in a fall from his Moscow apartment.

Nikolai Gorokhov, 53, reportedly plunged from his-fourth floor apartment Tuesday as a crane was lifting a large bathtub into his home. He is now in hospital with serious head injuries, according to a statement from William Browder, Magnitskys former employer at the Hermitage Capital Management firm.

Gorokhov was due to represent Magnitskys mother Wednesday in a Moscow court and is a witness in a U.S. money laundering case.

<TEXT> Yes and no. A lower court will almost always defer to precedent from a higher court because that is the highest say in terms of the law in that jurisdiction. Now, if a lower court wants a different outcome but feels bound by precedent, they can write an opinion basically stating that. This will go to appeal and when you get to a court that has an equivalent or higher precedential authority, you can get the law changed. However, a lower court judge going against higher court precedent without sufficient justification will probably get struck down. There's a lot of deference given both ways, from higher to lower in terms of facts and from lower to higher in terms of law. 

Anyway, if the 10th Circuit doesn't agree with a Supreme Court opinion, they can always make a ruling that goes against it. But they'll probably get struck down, depending on who is on the higher court bench. However, this can work to effectuate changes in the law or to point out that the precedent doesn't achieve its intended goal (for example with something like "separate but equal" originally being declared constitutional but subsequently struck down). 

So for the most part, they're bound by precedent (especially at the trial level). But there are cases where they can go against precedent and depending on the case, their ruling might stick. However, what's more likely is they'll write an opinion strongly suggesting that the law needs to be revisited while ruling with the precedent to enable a justifiable appeal. Circuit Courts tend to have more leeway to affect changes in the law than other courts (excluding the highest state court or the Supreme Court).  

Edit: Also worth mentioning that decisions outside your jurisdiction are persuasive, not binding, so the court isn't obligated to follow them. Also, if it matters, I'm a lawyer and practice constitutional law among other things.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For context:

Manafort was a top adviser to Yanukovych from 2004 to 2014. **Ukrainian authorities have said Yanukovych created the conditions that led to the security forces opening fire. Ukraine's interior ministerissued a warrant for his arrestshortly after the uprising.** He fled to Russia and was granted asylum.

Manafort has not been linked to thekillings.

Well, until now when his daughters' text messages drew a straight line. 

Manafort, a Republican operative who had advised authoritarian leaders like the Democratic Republic of Congo'sMobutu Sese Seko and the Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos, is credited with revamping Yanukovych's image and helping him win the presidency in 2010.

**Manafort continued advising Yanukovych until he was ousted amid the Euromaidan protests and forced to flee to Russia, where he is now living under the Kremlin's protection.** Manafort resurrected the Party of Regionsin late 2014, rebranding it as the Opposition Bloc and expanding it to include parties that were opposed to the protests and, later, to the new pro-EU president Petro Poroshenko.

 Edit: Further context. 

**On February 20, 2014, Ukrainian riot police opened fire on thousands of demonstrators who had gathered in central Kiev.** They were protesting President Viktor Yanukovych's last-minute decision to back out of a deal with the European Unionthat would have distanced Ukraine from Russia and fostered closer ties with the West.

A human-rights lawyer representing the victims of the mass police shootings,Eugenia Zakrevska, now wants to knowwho was advising or influencingYanukovychwhen he ordered Ukrainian security forces to crush the protests with force.

This applies to both nuclear weapons and other long-range weapons systems/ICBMs. While the U.S. has threatened increased sanctions if North Korea were to proceed, it appears that now they don't care what the American government does and are willing to proceed regardless. Along with this comes some signaling of global perception of Americas ability to continue acting as a de facto global hegemon.

<TEXT> Saw it over the weekend and I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't especially like Emma Watson's singing style, where she didn't hold notes as long as the original, but her performance overall was great, she has a good voice, the movie was well made, and the performances were all solid. My only other complaint is that if was a little long...ten minutes shorter and it would have been ideal. 

Anyway, I'm not really the demographic but I went into it open and walked away happy I saw it. I think the animated version is still better, but it's a good, highly faithful adaptation.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Which is great and I'm all for that. But he's not some leftist part of the party, he's his own thing. The party has its own far left elements. I honestly believe that Sanders should make his own party. He'd have the support. 

But he *chose* to use the framework of the Democrats party. Then he *chose* to abandon it once the party voters overwhelmingly didn't vote for him in the primary. And he continually bleeds support for the party while chastising it. Which, of course, means that Dems don't get votes. Which means that the policies he wants passed don't get passed. Because he's operating outside the party again and positioning himself against them. 

So what fucking point are his rallies and support if he has no party/candidates of his own and holds hostage support for the party to which he's more closely affiliated? Republicans don't want what he's selling, aside from the fracturing of the Dems. And Dems are still wary of him because, again, he's not a Democrat. 

I get that people hate incrementalism and it's fair to have a more direct policy agenda. That's an honest criticism of the party. But Sanders is doing fuck all to aid his agenda. 

For example, with the West Virginia stunt, he's not currently running for office and they aren't his constituents. They don't even have an election right now and there aren't any candidates on the table for 2018. So what the hell is he doing there? Telling his supporters in coal country how much the administration sucks? They already know that, they're his supporters. He's not announcing a new party, he's just saying Republicare blows. He's got an idea with Medicare for All and its currently in a House committee, but he's not going out and talking about the specifics of that bill. Same thing with the debate against Ted Cruz. What did that accomplish? What new thing did we get from that? Did that magically create new legislation or the formation of a new party/ideology? Or was it two people who lost their primaries talking issues that they have no political power to shape. 

Seriously, for the sake of America, Sanders has to fucking decide to actually win and have a real plan for what he's going to do then stick to it. Or else the left will keep fracturing and losing elections and the right wing fascism of the GOP will continue tanking this country. You can't do shit if you keep losing because of principle.  </TEXT>
