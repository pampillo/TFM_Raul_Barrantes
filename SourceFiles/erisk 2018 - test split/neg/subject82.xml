<TEXT> I'm not sure about grandchildren but Albert and his first wife, Mileva Mari, had a daughter who was either adopted or died at a young age, but her real fate is unknown. They also had two sons. The eldest son, [Hans Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Albert_Einstein), went on to be a professor of Hydraulic Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Their second son, Eduard, was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 20 and eventually he was permanently committed to an asylum. 

Albert and Mileva divorced after she learned he had a romantic attraction to his first and second cousin Elsa, who he eventually married. So if they had kids, they probably wouldn't have been the brightest. </TEXT>

The story goes that he defeated up to 40 soldiers before someone got a makeshift boat and stabbed him with a spear from underneath the bridge.

<TEXT> From what I've read it seems like it was more of a morale boost and part of a code of honor, like the [Combat of Thirty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_of_the_Thirty), than anything else. The Battle of [Kulikovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kulikovo) opened with single combat between two champions, both died, and the battle took place soon after. Also, the Battle of [Badr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Badr) started with three champions from each side engaged in combat and again the battle proper began afterwards. 

The Battle of the [300 Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_300_Champions) is really interesting because this was actually intended to prevent Sparta and Argos from committing their entire armies to battle and risk massive losses as well as settle the dispute politically.  Well, through a series of events both sides claimed victory and a full scale battle happened anyway.  

It was also traditional for Japanese Samurai to challenge each other to single combat.  A samurai would control a unit of foot soldiers and challenge opposing samurai, the defeat of the samurai would often cause the whole unit to retreat and change the overall course of the battle.  This continued until they had to change their fighting style during the Mongol Invasions of Japan.
According to our manner of fighting we must first call out by name someone from the enemy ranks, and then attack in single combat. But the Mongols took no notice at all of such conventions. They rushed forward all together in a mass, grappling with any individuals they could catch and killing them.

**TL;DR:** It depended on the era and if the leaders of both sides kept their word. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Drugs have been used as stimulants in warfare for a long time, it is thought that Old Norse berserkers would consume hallucinogenic mushrooms or a bunch of alcohol before battle. There is also a book I read a few years ago called [A Long Way Gone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Long_Way_Gone) by Ishmael Beah. It's a memoir about his life as a child soldier in the civil war of Sierra Leone in the 90's. The kids were given "brown brown", "white pills", and marijuana to brainwash them and numb them to violence.

There's also a podcast by Stuff They Don't Want You To Know called [Is The Military On Drugs?](http://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/is-the-military-on-drugs.htm) which is discusses the practice throughout history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because it is the law.

"Modern laws of war regarding conduct during war (jus in bello), such as the 1949 Geneva Conventions, provide that it is unlawful for belligerents to engage in combat without meeting certain requirements, such as wearing distinctive uniform or other distinctive signs visible at a distance, carrying weapons openly, and conducting operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war. Impersonating enemy combatants by wearing the enemys uniform is allowed, though fighting in that uniform is unlawful perfidy, as is the taking of hostages."
