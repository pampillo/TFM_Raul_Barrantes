<TEXT> Thanks for the thoughts. It was a dry/old shed. Most likely undisturbed for at least 3-5 years, maybe more. 

We cleared out the space to make a DIY music venue. We had our first show last night and decided to call the space Mummy Cat Lounge.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very envious of you.  I, unfortunately, only came across his work today..  
I went on a deep dive (4 hours..or more) into his music and was completely blown away.  I listen to a few tracks and was hooked then started reading more about him... The first track I listened to after I read about his death was "Coward". It really hit me hard.  Wish I would have known about his music sooner.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you reviewed Amazon's "review guidelines"? I'm curious if your review was indeed in conflict with Amazon's policy? 

I know this is irrelevant to your point but you should protest against Amazon for rejecting your review.  

If your goal is to see this policy revised, then push to make that happen. I would argue that one of the first steps of making this change would be to be sure that review remains on Amazon's marketplace. 

Good luck,
