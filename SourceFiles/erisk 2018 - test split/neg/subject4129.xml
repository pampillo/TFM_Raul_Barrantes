<TEXT> I would 100% rather have Gini than Allen, i loved Allen and always did, even wanted him to be the next Xavi haha, but Liverpool are ranked the lowest in the height/weight department and we needed stronger and taller players. Allen just didn't cut the mustard to be a started and he wanted first team football. Gini is strong and holds the ball up really well aswell as being very composed in the box. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, im a big fan of road trip movies, or road trip-esque movies where a character or a group of characters need to go from point A to point B, the movies don't necessarily have to be great, but for some reason these type of movies i find incredibly relaxing and easy to watch.

Here are some of the ones i have seen and enjoyed

- Harold and Kumar (all 3)
- Euro Trip
- Road Trip
- The Guilt Trip (Guilty Pleasure)
- Stan Helsing (Guilty Pleasure)
- Little Miss Sunshine
- Due Date
- Sex Drive
- Crystal Fairy   the Magical Cactus

If anyone can give me suggestions it would be appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wanted to know what your thoughts were on that 2nd half formation change? I was happy to finally see a change in formation but it's just a shame we did when we were 2-0 down. Do you think the change helped the players? Would you like to see us change to that formation in the future?

This is how i saw the change last night

What opinions do you have on this, it's clear that the 4-3-3 is done and against lesser oppo i would love to see something different because we've been found out. </TEXT>

Different game, same shit. I hope Klopp gets a bollocking because yet again we play the same fucking useless formation that hasn't worked. the 3 in the middle does nothing against teams that sit back, no link up play, nothing. On a somewhat brighter note, our performance in the 2nd half was half decent, we changed formation and didn't look like utter shit. If we continue to play this formation for the rest of the season i'm seriously gonna be worried. top 4 is looking less and less likely with every game.
It's also good to know what we were doing in spain the past two weeks, fingering eachother on the pitch playing patty cake. great </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ben Woodburn </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-22 00:13:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just wanted to give my opinion on something very quick, considering that we haven't played well at all these past few premier league games (even Cup games) I figured why not give Woodburn a chance in the first team? it's clear that we're missing Mane and having Can and Gini do the same thing on the pitch isn't helping anyone. I figured someone like Woodburn can step in, and get given a chance just like TAA. I think we should go back to what worked earlier in the season, having Hendo, Lallana and Gini in the midfield, instead of changing two players positions we should only change one, as it would keep more of the chemistry in the team. From what I have seen of Woodburn is that his ball control looks amazing for someone his age, he seems very composed on the ball and looks to get in behind when possible (which is something we've lacked). Origi has been given several opportunities as of late and hasn't taken them, I think he should be rested for a bit and have Woodburn take his place for a bit.

I didn't know who Kenny Omega was, decided to watch NJPW and it was the best decision i have made in a long time. WWE have booked the championship so poorly these last few years that it's going to take a lot for it to be prestigious again, AJ Styles is making it great again. </TEXT>

First and foremost i want to thank everyone that has supported my SADEVILLAIN tape, it has definitively been a highlight of my young life. I initially released the tape for fun not knowing it would blow up like it did, so as a thank you i wanted to make one last SADEVILLAIN mix. Bump DOOM all day, everyday!

I hope you guys enjoy this, feedback always welcome (im still learning as a producer)

<TEXT> So I'm spending time with my grandparents here in Germany and have been unable to watch any wwe programming since backlash. 

Can anyone bring me up to speed with what's been going on? I know sasha just won her title back. And rusev lost the us title to reigns. What's been the stand out highlight thus far and which show has been putting on better shows?.

Appreciate any replies  </TEXT>

<TITLE> An issue i had purchasing a Vinyl </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-24 17:38:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sorry if this isn't the correct place to post but i figured this fits the criteria.

So i purchased my first vinyl a few days ago and it was a mixtape that i made (called Sadevillain) but when i purchased this vinyl i noticed the cover had "Sadevillain" spelled wrong (this was my fault and will make sense in a moment)

A little backstory, i created this mixtape and uploaded it onto Datpiff (a mixtape hosting site) and i was dumb enough to not only misspell the title but to misspell the actual front cover. When the tape blew up i noticed the error and immediately fixed it (reuploaded the tape with the correct spelling) 

Fast forward a month or so and i find out that this mixtape is being sold as a vinyl, to which i thought "holy shit! my mixtape is on vinyl!!" so i immediately went to purchase it (the mixtape they advertised had the correct spelling) i thought nothing of it until i open the package up and to my horror it had the old cover with the misspelled name.

I contacted the company that i bought it from and they told me to contact the distributor, as they are the ones who deal with the printing... my question is, how do i know who distributed it and where can i find out? 

any help is appreciated


TL;DR: My mixtape got a vinyl release, wrong cover was used and i wanted to get the updated cover (as advertised) printing on the sleeve instead.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is Deadpool in the movie a true reflection of his comic book character? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-15 13:12:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I personally dont read comics and know very little about these sort of things as im not a massive fan of superhero movies in general. I decided to give Deadpool a go because it was rated R and it peaked my curiosity/interest. Although i didn't think it was an amazing movie i did enjoy it quite a bit, and will definitely check out the sequel. 

As for Deadpool himself, how accurate is his representation? I know they didn't add his Schizophrenia, which is weird because it would be a good reason for his constant 4th wall breaks (which i thought were pretty bizarre). I remember people telling me he was a badass, but this movie (IMO) made him feel like a bit of a joke, which i guess was the intention with the constant jokes but is that what hes like in the comics? is there anything else they missed out?

<TEXT> Posted a couple of DOOM mixes which involve samples of Sade, the response was pretty good and someone came up with the idea of making a SADEVILLIAN mixtape, im down with the idea but i just wanted to know if more people would be interested in listening to it? im not a very skilled producer and im still learning the ropes with production but i feel like it would be a dope idea to put out a remix tape of SADEVILLIAN (Sade   DOOM) (consisting of about 4-5 tracks worth 2-3 skits/intro/outro)

Im currently working on the 3rd track and i might upload a snippet of it for you if you want to hear it. Another thing i wanted to add is if there is anyone who is a skilled graphic designer or knows any graphic designer that can make a SADEVILLIAN mixtape cover please hit me up!

Leave me your suggestions on how you guys would like the mixtape to go and if you have an cartoon sampled that you know of that uses the words "Doom, "Villian" "Metal Face" "Mask" or anything let me know aswell. 

Thanks for reading  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Treadmill Exercises? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got a treadmill for Christmas and would love if someone could give me a steady daily routine (or every other day, would prefer daily)

info about me: Male (18 y/o)/5'8/11.7 stone (164lbs)

im very out of shape and would love to lose some fat as i feel very flabby and what not, im not the type of person that has always been like this, i was very fit when i was younger but since i left school and started college, none of my mates in college played football/soccer (which is how i stayed fit) and that led to me gaining weight.

any daily treadmill routine for someone like me would be great, thanks!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as cliche as it sounds, I'm going to try to lose weight this year. For Christmas my parents got me a treadmill (don't worry, i asked for it)

I'm an 18 year old male, 5'8 and weight 11.7 stone (164lbs) and feel very out of shape and flabby. What i would like to know is, whats the best stuff to do on a treadmill? i plan on doing it daily or at least every other day (i go on the treadmill at night in my garage because i like the quiet) and just did my first run on it and created my own little thing, which consisted of:

4.5kmh walk for 4.5 mins
11kmh sprint for 30 secs
4.5kmh walk for 4.5 mins
11kmh sprint for 30 secs
4.5kmh walk for 4.5 mins
11kmh sprint for 30 secs

2 min rest and another

4.5kmh walk for 4.5 mins
11kmh sprint for 30 secs
4.5kmh walk for 4.5 mins
11kmh sprint for 30 secs
4.5kmh walk for 4.5 mins
11kmh sprint for 30 secs

What i noticed is that my ankles tense up a bit for some reason and makes it kind of uncomfortable, not sure if thats normal or what.

again i have no idea what im doing, if thats the right routine but for my first run and just wanted to get a feel of the treadmill and do my own thing

i have my diet under control so no need to wrry about that

any advice is greatly appreciated :D </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So i got a new PC for Christmas as my old one was corrupted. I went about setting up my new PC by installing Windows 7 and then going on to get the free update to Windows 10. I went about installing windows 7 but the product key did not work (legit copy of windows 7) so i had to resort to finding an online key which did work. Upon installing windows 7 i went to install Windows 10, everything went smoothly until i entered the product key, i had to go through multiple ones online to find one that worked and when it does it says "Windows cannot activate right now" i have tried multiple keys and they all work, but all come up with the same error message.

Any help?

<TITLE> Best Youtubers To Watch? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I used to watch loads of YouTubers back in the day during MW2, WaW and BO2 and most of the people i watched that i admired don't upload COD videos anymore. I was wondering which YouTubers you guys watch? im not a fan of those view whoring YouTubers (Ali-A, Prestige Is Key, TmArtn etc...) I prefer the likes of Chris Smoove (used to love his MW2 stuff) Thunder, and WingsOfRedemption. Are there any guys that you watch? i like watching people play the game in their own unique way and dont just rush about a lot dropping 80+ kills every game.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Questions:

1) Whats the craziest game you have stewarded at? and what made it so crazy?

2) Does it get boring looking at the fans for 90mins?

3) Have you ever been hurled abuse at? 

4) How do you get into Stewarding and what qualifications are required?

Thanks!

<TEXT> For example, i'm a big fan of football/soccer and there are lots of players that are just more likely to get injured, Daniel Sturridge is a player that plays for m favorite team (Liverpool) and hes incredibly prone to injury, (thigh injury) so i'm just wondering how some people just get unlucky with long term injuries than people who almost never get inured.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I mean.

I haven't been heavily into wrestling since 09, and i feel what made WWE so fun to watch was all the over the top gimmicks they had. Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, The Undertaker, Mankind, Kane (Demon), Big Boss Man, etc. And now there aren't really anymore of these gimmicks around, apart from the few that are still here (Taker, Kane etc.) i enjoyed seeing dumb wrestler come out with their over the top gimmicks and attires. I'ts just a bit tedious to watch now. </TEXT>

<TITLE> M/18/5'8/163lb - Muscle Tone? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-20 16:11:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this is my first post on this Subreddit.

I'm 18 years old and weigh about 11.7 stone (give or take a pound) i wouldn't consider myself fat or overweight (even though technically my BMI is just in the region of being overweight) but i'm very unfit and really out of shape. 

The problem is, is that i don't live near a gym and even if i did i don't exactly have the money for a membership. So i've been thinking of doing DDP yoga along with a 7 Minute Beginner Workout in which i've been doing for about 4 days now (muscles are sore atm, good thing right?) is this the correct way to go about it? As far as my diet goes, i eat 3 meals a day, don't drink sodas (only water, coffee and tea) but occasionally have a low carb monster or something slightly unhealthy here and there (homemade cheeseburger, homemade chips, etc..) i'm not looking to get ripped i just want to have some form of muscle tone to my physique.

Thanks for reading! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, My PC has been crashing and playing up for about a year now and i have tried every possible issue on how to resolve it (apart from buying new hardware) the issue i have is that my PC keeps running into BSOD's and i'm getting sick and tired of it, on other occasions my PC will just freeze and my monitor will switch off and will display a no signal. i have reinstalled my drivers, updated them, refreshed my whole PC (about 10 times) reinstalled windows (about 10 times)

i have run a memory diagnostic on my RAM individually and it came up with 0 errors on both occasions. 

here is a dump on the blue screens.

<TITLE> PC keeps crashing, don't know the issue. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-10 14:57:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Specs: http://imgur.com/qrjGwFg

So i've been having this issue for about a year now and before i buy new hardware i want to make 100% sure its not a software issue.

What happens is my PC will crash sporadically throughout the day, some days it will not crash at all, other days it will crash 5-10 times a day. When my PC crashes i will sometimes just randomly freeze (need to hold power button to force restart) or i will get a blue screen with various different messages (usually MEMORY_MANAGEMENT or SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION, and sometimes other random ones), and other times my monitor will just switch off and will receive no signal (i connected my TV to my pc to see if its my monitor thats faulty or my PC, and when it randomly switched off my TV switched off aswell) i have update all of my drivers and updated every windows update i have. i have also ran several scans on CMD Prompt (SFC /SCANNOW, CHKDSK) and nothing, aswell as memory diagnostic and it says my memory is fine. I also checked inside my PC and there doesn't seem to be any issues with it. 

Now, the weird thing is, 4 weeks ago i deleted some partitions, and my PC was running fine, 0 issues what so ever, then i checked Slimdrivers to see if i needed any updates and i had about 12 to do, ever since i updated them i have had several issues, (it crashed about 10 minutes after the reboot) so i decided to do a system restore to before the updates, and it still crashed, several times :/

I'm running out of ideas and i dont want to spend 80 - 200 on new RAM when it says my ram is fine. 

any help is hugely appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need help finding a movie </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-31 23:42:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was about 5/6 years old (born in 1997) and i remember watching a movie over a friends house with his parents. all i remember was being frightened by it and constantly looking away, the only scene i remember was a scene that involved two kids that were trying to enter a room (i think it was a sci-fi alien kind of movie) and they turned out to be aliens (or robots) that took the form of two children. i've been trying to track down this film ever since and never got round to finding it, theres another scene that i remember (not sure if its the same movie, i should expect so) and i think it was the ending, there was a guy ( i think he was black) that was fighting someone and he ended up getting killed by either a propeller blade from a helicopter or something similar.

i know its vague but this is honestly all i can remember, any help would be appreciated </TEXT>
