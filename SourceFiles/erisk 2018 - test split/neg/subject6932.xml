1. That kind of accusation can get you banned here.

<TEXT> Because Trump hired him back on. I'm sure Obama *could* have stepped in and personally stopped Flynn's clearance from being reinstated, but he knew how that would play out. Flynn received clearance after a CIA background check, but as it turns out not even the same clearance he had before. 

Also, and I don't mean to be rude, but are you reading your own source? First off most of it is quoting Sean Spicer, which is not a good guarantee of it being true. Second, it mentions how Flynn left in 2014, losing his clearance, and how he regained it in 2016. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The American auto industry has twice nearly been killed by rising fuel prices. The first time they made it through "innovating" (copying the Europeans and Japanese) but the second time it decimated the industry. And it's going to happen all over again. Fuel is cheap now so they've fallen back into the old habits of just building massive cars with massive engines and they're going to feel the pain once that bubble inevitably bursts. </TEXT>

And had they self-identified as tacos, they would not have been allowed because tacos were not allowed to compete. [x](https://archive.fo/5qgkV) </TEXT>

This attitude is so dumb. If you actually bother to put the work in and not treat it like a daycare, community college is just as good as any other college; you get the same degree and the same experience.

then again I'm retarded

<TEXT> If you give a poor person an extra $100, they spend almost all of it. Give a rich person that same $100 and they save almost all of it. Raising the minimum wage impacts poorer people most, which means that they start buying more. There's a limit to this, obviously, because eventually you hit diminishing returns, but it's a pretty effective stimulus, especially when minimum wage is so far behind inflation as it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the problem is he's trying to make exactly the same show he used to make, but with more complex and adult topics. And that format doesn't quite work as well for adults; the song and dance and whacky visuals are kind of cringy, but objectively so was the original show. It just didn't matter because it was aimed at a younger audience (that was usually at school so anything was preferable to a normal class). </TEXT>

The hacking doesn't work like that, the laptop dangling from the cable like that doesn't work like that, the roof on the car doesn't work like that, changing gears doesn't work like that because you have him go through more gears than the car has, changing gears doesn't work like that because you clearly show both hands on the wheel during a gear change but also show a clutch pedal in the footwell shots, the car could not possibly have gone fast enough to catch that aircraft, certainly not at anything less than top speed, the car wouldn't have enough torque to break the tires loose at near top speed, the plane would not survive a collision with the tower and keep flying, the car wouldn't have enough braking force to stop in time, and to top it off sliding sideways would make the car take longer to stop.

Yeah, Scorpion won that little game.

Edit: Oh, and they wouldn't have had enough runway to do that. At the stall speed of a jet that size (which the car could conceivably reach), you'd need a 7km runway to fly for the 120 seconds in this video. The longest runway in the world is only 5.5km. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just think it's suspicious that the userbase here seems to accept just about anything that demonizes people that they hate regardless of what (if any) evidence is provided (though that's kind of a normal human trait). There's such an overlap with T_D, which constantly votes up things that just aren't true, and are demonstrably untrue, and disallows any kind of dissent. And as another user here has pointed out, it's pretty obvious when this sub is being used to push a narrative (the Macron emails are being pushed by a bunch of brand new accounts) but the users who supposedly are aware of when a conspiracy is afoot never seem to notice if they like that narrative (again, kind of normal human behavior but it's so clearly partisan and manipulated).

I'm not sure if that made much sense; I'm just kind of tired of pointing this out and getting shouted down (even though someone saying that Soros and co are flooding this sub with liberal shills never gets the same sort of skepticism). </TEXT>

And the fact that you say it doesn't matter what someone looks like; you're not attracted if they're trans means that you *choose* to not be attracted to someone, even if your initial impression might be that you are. That kinda comes across as insecure about your sexuality unless you only ever hook up with someone with the intent of having children, which would be weird but hey that's your choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At they Olympic level they require hormones be within spec for at least two years. Worth mentioning is that if you have a medical reason to be taking a "banned" substance, so long as you disclose it and let them monitor it to make sure you're within spec you're allowed to compete. It's called Safe Harbor in a lot of athletic leagues.

Also worth mentioning, at the Olympics so far as I know there have only ever been two openly trans athletes, and neither of them won anything. If there was no advantage or disadvantage, you'd expect to see about thirty participate every year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In your submissions, which is wht I was referring to, the majority are supporting and positive.

Only in the last two, where someone was murdered. That is not typical of /r/news. It is typical of /r/politics. Obviously there's some crossover, but the two do not react the same way.

Also, just an observation, but I can't believe you're not trying to bait a reaction.

I did briefly try to gauge a reaction. There was a brief period where I posted articles and at  the same time posted articles about athletes who had been caught doping. I was interested if the people who insisted they were upset that sports were unfair would show up in any of those threads. That's not really baiting though; if I wanted that I could have found plenty of less objective hosts that would present a much more radical version of a particular story.

Fact is, trans equality is something that matters a lot to me, so if I see something about it in the news I share it. </TEXT>

That was skewed because it only asked people from two campuses that were already known to have a sexual assault problem. The authors of that study have said that the results were only meant to be taken for those schools and not as a representative sample.

So I'd have to see the questions in this survey.

We don't kill suicidal people to cure depression, we don't cater to the body dismorphia present in anorexic or bulimic patients, we cure the underlying disease or illness

That's because those have psychological causes and we can with therapy and medication correct those causes. The underlying causes of dysphoria or gender nonconformity can't be manipulated, but the body can.

This is societal pressure directly influencing proven science.

When that's how you start a discussion about a trans woman, and simply keep repeating a claim that being trans is a mental illness and that affirmative treatment is "mutilation", while providing no evidence of that claim and ignoring evidence to the contrary, and calling me a Nazi for disagreeing (nevermind that gay and trans people were put to death in Nazi Germany), it's not a stretch to make that assumption. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I can do better than just one doctor: 

[Sex refers to a person's biological status and is typically categorized as male, female or intersex. There are a number of indicators of biological sex, including sex chromosomes, gonads, internal reproductive organs and external genitalia. (APA, 2012).](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/diversity-schools.aspx?item=3)

They do cite themselves, which I think is a bit immodest but then again if I had over a hundred thousand members I'd source stuff from in-house too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of laws are written with gendered language but it's understood that unless specified it's gender-neutral. This bill forces the opposite of that assumption. So, for example, a law that references a "husband and wife" cannot be taken to mean "husband and wife or husband and husband or wife and wife", which means only straight marriage would be accepted as valid for a lot of things, even if gay marriage is is legal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. It's not just chromosomes. Sex is determined based on chromosomes, internal and external genitals, and a couple of secondary characteristics that don't really hit until puberty. In actual practice the determination is made based on external genitalia; very rarely are chromosomes actually tested.

<TEXT> Identity is just how you feel, your self-image. It's like in the Matrix when Neo has hair in the simulation because that's part of his self-image, how he sees himself (though this is more than just hair, obviously).

As for how you know, well, per the APA:

 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) provides for one overarching diagnosis of gender dysphoria with separate specific criteria for children and for adolescents and adults.
 
 In adolescents and adults gender dysphoria diagnosis involves a difference between ones experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, and significant distress or problems functioning. It lasts at least six months and is shown by at least two of the following:
 
 1. A marked incongruence between ones experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
 
 2. A strong desire to be rid of ones primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
 
 3. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender
 
 4. A strong desire to be of the other gender
 
 5. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender
 
 6. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender
 
 In children, gender dysphoria diagnosis involves at least six of the following and an associated significant distress or impairment in function, lasting at least six months.
 
 1. A strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other gender
 
 2. A strong preference for wearing clothes typical of the opposite gender
 
 3. A strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe play or fantasy play
 
 4. A strong preference for the toys, games or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other gender
 
 5. A strong preference for playmates of the other gender
 
 6. A strong rejection of toys, games and activities typical of ones assigned gender
 
 7. A strong dislike of ones sexual anatomy
 
 8. A strong desire for the physical sex characteristics that match ones experienced gender
 
 For children, cross-gender behaviors may start between ages 2 and 4, the same age at which most typically developing children begin showing gendered behaviors and interests. Gender atypical behavior is common among young children and may be part of normal development. Children who meet the criteria for gender dysphoria may or may not continue to experience it into adolescence and adulthood. Some research shows that children who had more intense symptoms and distress, who were more persistent, insistent and consistent in their cross-gender statements and behaviors, and who used more declarative statements (I am a boy (or girl) rather than I want to be a boy (or girl)) were more likely to become transgender adults. </TEXT>

Si why am I not shocked that the ACLU would side with the retarded position that a confused teenager should be able to shower shop in junior high and high school on a whim and regardless of biological sex? Moreover title 9 has fuck all to do with this as the authors obviously never intended for protection of the fair sex to mean the dude that wants to go shower with chicks. [5]

---

Well I mean yeah... She's a man. [Yes I'm aware that's a Jake from State Farm reference. Doesn't make it appropriate.] [18]

---

Maybe there is a difference between physical gender, of which there are two, and individualized mental perception of gender. And maybe all of society is being extorted into pretending this difference doesn't exist by a bunch of mentally unstable people that will become triggered and riot if anyone says anything about the Emperor's New Clothes. [17]

---

Ugh, ridiculous. Why should I pay for someone's cosmetic surgery? [30]

Hey depressed people who are suicidal also want to change thier body. From alive to dead. Should insurance pay for that too? [13]

---

Who gives a fuck. Quit trying to normalize this mental illness. [6]

A lot of the worst that were just cheap jokes were removed, but they had not usually been buried by downvotes before then, to say the least.

<TEXT> [Dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) is a severe discomfort caused by having a body that doesn't match one's gender identity. Not transitioning can aggravate it, but not all trans people experience dysphoria. Some simply have their identity but aren't distressed if their body doesn't match (although under the current definition that counts as dysphoria too (there's some controversy over the exact definition at the moment)). Either way, transition is typically recommended, though the extend to which it's required is far different.

There are some slight physical differences between male and female brains. Trans people seem to have brains that are physically like those of the sex of the gender they identify as. Why exactly this happens is still a mystery.

[Zhou et al 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289)

[Kruijver et al 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193)

[Gooren 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870186)

[Rametti et al 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024)

To oversimplify, some people have bodies that don't match the sex of their brain and for many that causes serious strain, but we can alter the body to match the brain and that works pretty well. </TEXT>

2. Mentally ill? Nope. According to the APA, ["identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder."](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx)

3. Gays? Possibly. Your gender identity doesn't necessarily dictate your sexuality. There are both straight and gay trans people.

4. Deviants? Possibly. Your gender doesn't necessarily dictate your kinkiness. There are both kinky and vanilla trans people.

5. They need to get help with their mental illness? Again, while I'd like to stress that being transgender is not itself a mental illness, failing to get treatment to affirm one's gender can cause it it. Again per the [APA](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria), transition is part of recommended treatment.

6. Not get butchered by a plastic surgeon? I should hope not; it's far better to get competent surgeon if surgery is required, though that usually goes without saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's no reason for evolution to give people red hair either, but it's not a disorder. Plus, the [APA](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria), which writes the DSM, [disagrees](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx)

Identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder.

<TEXT> Really? From the [APA](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria), the people who write the DSM. Nowhere in there does it say that all trans people have dysphoria, and in fact it recommends transition with hormones and (sometimes) surgery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Capitalist Communist: no, those are antithetical.

Democratic Communist: yes, on paper. In reality not so much because full-on capital C Communists usually are the only party on the ballot if they can make that happen.

Democratic Socialist: absolutely. It's a subtle distinction but basically Communists believe in a command economy (five year plans etc) and Socialists believe in a demand economy, but with lots of state ownership (ideally both believe in direct ownership but it's tricky in practice).

Of course this is kind of oversimplified; any political movement will have different ideals depending on who you ask. </TEXT>

The parents aren't making any questionable decision here. Dysphoria is a real thing and refusing to treat it is a terrible thing to do to a person, especially a kid. Plus, until 16 or so nothing is permanent. Puberty blockers are completely reversible. Even hormone therapy is reversible if you really want it. Surgery is the only thing that's really hard to reverse but that won't happen for at least ten years, assuming it happens at all.

The virtue signaling option for these parents in a conservative church and conservative home-school group would have been to insist loudly that Avery is a boy, because that's what the people around them wanted to hear.

Look, this kid is their daughter, she was miserable before when she was living as a boy, because that's not her. Her parents don't gain anything by letting her be her other than a loving daughter, in fact they lose quite a lot for accepting her. They were cast out of their church, out of their schooling group, her father lost business, much of her family cut ties. I've been the kid of someone who loved to use me as some accessory to actually virtue signal; trust me this isn't that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is well-accepted truth. Being trans is not a mental illness. Trans people have brains that are physically like those of the sex of the gender they identify as.

[Zhou et al 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289)

[Kruijver et al 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193)

[Gooren 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870186)

[Rametti et al 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024)

This is the basis for dysphoria. Fortunately, transition is the treatment for that. We can alter the body to match the brain, or use puberty blockers to keep the body from getting any further from the brain. That greatly reduces *internal* strain, but unfortunately we are social creatures so being cast out, harassed, bullied, etc just for existing has an effect on you; we don't live in a vacuum.

As for the second part of your comment, the family isn't treating Avery as some kind of ideological fashion accessory, they're treating her like their kid. Forcing her to live as a boy would be detrimental to her health; she was miserable when she was living as a boy before, and there's simply no reason to force her to be miserable for her entire childhood when letter her grow her hair out and wear girl's clothes is all it takes to help her. If they wanted a fashion accessory, they wouldn't pick one that gets them death threats, one that gets them kicked out of their church, one that drives away their businesses's clients. They're parents doing the right thing for their kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it was just about states rights, the Fugitive Slave Act wouldn't have been a thing. If it was about states rights, the Confederate constitution wouldn't have prohibited its member states from banning slavery. Oh, but it was about the economy... built on the backs of slaves.

Look, I'm not saying that every Confederate soldier was a bastard who woke up every morning with a hard-on for the institution of slavery. By and large they were ordinary guys who had been told their homes were under attack, good men following orders and such. To them, the Confederate Flag a symbol of their home, of freedom, whatever it needed to be that's what it meant to them. But we know better now. 

And I'm not saying the Union were saints by any means. Sherman's March to the Sea, just torching whole towns, etc, those are all kinda fucked up. But that isn't the cause of the war; that happened in the middle of it not before it. And sure, there were plenty of racists up North as well, but they didn't go to war over that.

To the North it wasn't officially about slavery until about halfway through. To the South, though, the Civil War was *always* about slavery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The idea of forcing people to use their sex at birth as the sole factor for choosing the bathroom they use has not been in the mainstream until very recently. Fact is nobody gave it much thought before the GOP needed a new boogyman.

And you still haven't answered my question: should [these women](https://imgur.com/a/dMpqb) be forced to use the men's room? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Strange men like [these women](https://imgur.com/a/dMpqb)? Assigning restrooms solely by biological sex would force them into the men's room, wouldn't it? The fact is nobody has assigned restrooms by biological sex; only by how people look. Only recently has anyone even had the idea because religious conservatives needed another wedge issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said anything about it being a same-day response. And it's been more than half a year since the Brexit vote anyway and they've yet to open fire on the rest of the EU. Also, there's a legal process for leaving the EU, which the UK is following. The situations aren't the same.

Plus it doesn't matter how long it takes between you announcing something and then trying to enforce it with violence. You still got in the fight to back up whatever made you were doing in the first place, which in the case of the Confederacy was *explicitly* the continuation of slavery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Given that sexual orientation or gender identity are not things that the University asks about (well gender identity technically, but they don't ask if that differs from the sex assigned at birth), there's not really a practical way to go about doing it regardless of if they want to or not.

There are LGBT scholarships available, however, which many view as a form of affirmative action. Not being a UW-Madison student, I'm not entirely familiar with their scholarship application process. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Health insurance for transgender employees of the state is still pending litigation. At the moment the state of Wisconsin explicitly prohibits coverage for any procedure related to transition, even though the same treatments are not banned when they're for another purpose. Genital mutilation, from what I gather, is not a medical treatment, however you may be thinking of vaginoplasty or phalloplasty, which is. Breast augmentation may be covered, it may not be; I don't know the employee health plans in that level of detail but it's not unheard of for health plans to cover it in certain cases (usually as a constructive sugery when a mastectomy was previously required).

The ACLU is representing the plaintiffs, you can read more on that [here](https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-files-suit-wisconsin-over-denial-insurance-coverage-transgender-state-employees)

That, however, isn't the matter at hand here. This is simply UW-Madison officially putting out a statement of support for the rights of their transgender staff and students. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What sort of biology? The sort that says that trans people have brains physically different, reflecting structures seen in the brains of the sex of the gender they identify as? 

[Zhou et al 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289)

[Kruijver et al 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193)

[Gooren 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870186)

[Rametti et al 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024)

Because that biology recognizes that as real, and that the mismatch has serious implications, namely [dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria). Fortunately that biology also allowed us to work out that you can treat dysphoria, usually by altering the body to match the brain.

That sort of biology also recognizes that multiple factors determine sex and those factors do not always indicate the same thing, which comes from to all sorts of things like [XXY](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/klinefelter-syndrome), or [XY-AIS](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/androgen-insensitivity-syndrome), or [Swyer syndrome](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/swyer-syndrome) or mosaicism, none of which fit into a strict male/female dichotomy.

Is that the sort of biology you meant? Or did you mean the 6th-grade biology where everything is always either XX or XY and it's never any more complicated than that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Put it to you this way: you know that scene in the Matrix where Neo goes back in after seeing the real world for the first time? Remember how he's surprised that the plugs were gone and his hair was back? That's because his self-image, the way his brain saw himself, had hair and didn't have plugs in his neck.

(Switch, incidentally, was originally intended to be played by a woman inside the matrix and a man outside, which would have been a really nice detail, and actually really made sense since it turns out the Wachowskis are both trans. Now that I see it all in one place it makes sense that the matrix analogy is so useful because that's almost certainly what that scene was meant to explain in the first place.)

It's like that, but for your whole body. I assume based on your post history that you're a man (if not just flip the words so it makes sense). If you woke up every morning knowing that you're a man, but looking and sounding like a woman, and socializing as a woman, getting called by a woman's name, etc, that would wear on you. You know deep down that you're a man, but for whatever reason your body doesn't know and the people around you don't know and that eats away at you.

And it's not a typical matter of self-acceptance because you know and accept yourself, at least on some level, to be a man. There's no amount of therapy that can shake that, because it's hardwired in your brain. But your body refuses to cooperate, and so medicine intervenes. How extensive the treatment you need is varies from person to person, but on some level getting the body to conform to the brain is the answer, because that stops the brain from constantly being told that it's something it isn't and stops that erosion of self. </TEXT>

Verifiably false. Like I said before, the brain/body disconnect often leads to mental illness, but there's a physical difference in the brain, not just a mental one. 

people like you are normalizing it

People like me? What does that even mean? And what is there to normalize? Some people are trans, that's been a thing forever.

<TEXT> Being trans is not a mental illness. This man has (had) a body that doesn't match his brain. There are physical differences between male and female brains, and Minton got the short end of the deal when he was born with a male brain in an otherwise female body.

This mismatch is what causes dysphoria, but fortunately we're able to alter the body to match the brain, and that's the accepted treatment. How much alteration is required varies from person to person, but in Minton's case it required full reassignment surgery, part of which is the removal of the uterus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Men and women have slight physical differences in their brains, as well as more obvious physical differences between the rest of the body. Sometimes, for whatever reason, someone with a brain of one sex will wind up with a body of the other (I'm simplifying a bit).

[Zhou et al 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289)

[Kruijver et al 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193)

[Rametti et al 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024)

That mismatch between body and brain causes dysphoria, a state of depression or anxiety (in this case specifically regarding one's body). The treatment for this is to alter the body to match the brain (since going the other way isn't really possible). For some people it's more severe than for others and requires different levels of treatment.

Generally transition has four big steps:

1. Social transition. Basically where you adopt new pronouns and a new name and let people know. This isn't always first, sometimes it comes partway through transition.

2. Hormones. For some, this is enough. Even without surgery, hormones have a massive impact on your body.

3. Minor affirming surgeries. Basically these are cosmetic treatments like breast reduction/augmentation or facial surgery. Not everyone has this done, even if they go on to the next step.

4. Full reassignment surgery. This is where Minton is; he had genitals surgically constructed. Part of that process requires a hysterectomy and three months of recovery time.

Hopefully that's explained it. </TEXT>

have been recognized as the authoritative standards of care by leading medical organizations, the U.S.

14.. Under the WPATH standards, treatment for gender dysphoria may require medical steps
to affirm ones gender identity and help an individual transition from living as one gender to another.
This treatment, often referred to as transition-related care, may include hormone therapy, surgery
(sometimes called sex reassignment surgery or gender affirming surgery), and other medical services that align individuals bodies with their gender identities. The exact medical treatment varies
based on the individualized needs of the person.

<TEXT> So far as I'm aware, puberty blockers don't have any significant impact on bone density other than just delaying it's development. 

Hormone therapy does impact bone density; testosterone brings it up, estrogen brings it down. 

Puberty blockers are super reversible; normally it's just a case of not taking them anymore and puberty will get going on its own. Occasionally it can take a little kickstart, but occasionally puberty can take a kickstart regardless of puberty blockers.

Hormone therapy is also generally reversible, but it takes much longer; after all it's basically the same process the other way. But as far as I know there isn't much information on that because it's not something that happens very often; by the time you start on hormone therapy you've cleared a lot of hurdles.  </TEXT>

This is a sworn statement. If that's false, Minton can be tried for perjury.

The normal remedy for behavioral health conditions are, therapy and medications, not drastic, irreversible surgeries, 

Usually, yes. But being trans is not a purely psychological condition; there's no way to make the brain match the body but there is a way to make the body match the brain.

that don't turn a woman into a man in any case.

Minton already is a man. Between how his brain has always been, and how his body is now, he's a man.

LOL!! "phalloplasty" - why don't you tell our readers what that is in plain english?

Phalloplasty: surgical creation of a penis. You've got a bizarre sense of humor if that's somehow funny.

And if the Minton didn't get the phalloplasty on time, then what? Nothing

Not correct. Further denying affirming care would needlessly aggravate his dysphoria.

a woman would be spared permanent mutilation for a few more days or weeks.

Not a woman, not mutilation.

They refused to perform one procedure which is independent of being trans. 

That's not true; Dawson was able to perform a hysterectomy at that hospital on the same day. She basically had to abuse the emergency admission process at a different hospital to get Minton treated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1.. From the filing:

Dr. Dawson regularly performs hysterectomies at MSJMC, and in fact she had another
hysterectomy scheduled immediately following Mr. Mintons scheduled procedure. 

According to Mr. Ivie, MSJMC would not allow the hysterectomy to proceed because it was scheduled as part of a course of treatment for gender dysphoria, as opposed to any other medical
diagnosis. 

2.. Mental health is no different from any other sort of health. Also, most doctors do not disagree. Again from the filing: 

The widely accepted standards of care for treating gender dysphoria are published by the
World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). The WPATH Standards of Care
have been recognized as the authoritative standards of care by leading medical organizations, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, and federal courts.

3.. Time was particularly crucial in this particular case because phalloplasty had already been scheduled, but due to complications with insurance the hysterectomy couldn't be booked until after the date for phalloplasty had been set. And there has to be a three month gap between those procedures.

4.. Freedom of religion does not give free license for discrimination. I couldn't very well start a hospital and just flat out refuse to treat gay people on the basis of my religion. I encourage you to read the [filing](https://www.aclunc.org/docs/20170419-minton_complaint.pdf), particularly the First Cause of Action on pages 7 and 8. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually read that article as well, but it gets a lot of key facts just flat out wrong.

1. The hospital does regularly provide hysterectomies. They specifically said that they refused because Minton is trans.

2. The physician in charge of the procedure, following well-accepted standards, says the procedure is *not* elective.

3. Minton was only able to receive the procedure in a timely fashion because Dr. Dawson sort of abused the emergency admissions at another hospital where she worked.

4. The ACLU isn't suing because of how Minton feels, which would be a harassment (?) suit, but because he was discriminated against, a Title VII suit.

Overall this is a very misleading article by one of Reason's most blatantly partisan contributors.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh, I know. It's just the worst when people expect things like medical care without being discriminated against. Why should minorities be allowed to have anything like that, don't they know how much of a burden that puts on the system?

Edit: For real, don't worry about the opioid epidemic, don't worry about a shortage of mental health professionals, don't worry about a lack of research funding, don't worry a lack of affordable health insurance leading more and more people to flood the ER with issues that aren't emergencies or simple issues that were ignored until they became emergencies, clearly, *clearly* the biggest problem facing the medical system is a few trans people wanting equal access to healthcare. </TEXT>

[ACLU's suit](https://www.aclunc.org/docs/20170419-minton_complaint.pdf) for those interested.

Edit: Unruh Civil Rights Act; they aren't even going as high as Title VII in this case. I was thinking of a similar suit in Wisconsin that is using Title VII. </TEXT>

Far from it. Puberty blockers are entirely renversable. Also I'm not sure I believe that 80% number, not unless it's for a very broad definition of dysphoria.

<TEXT> I don't believe transsexuality is much of a political issue, outside of North Carolina.

It would be nice if that were true, but there are definitely places where it's political. Texas saw HB2 and really liked it. Many states don't have any anti-discrimination laws on the books regarding trans people, and not because they forgot. Some places put huge hurdles in front of people who try to change their ID or birth certificate.

it should be addressed by the medical professionals on an individual basis.

Again, how nice that would be. Unfortunately you have places where that process is intervened. Wisconsin, for instance, specifically prohibits any insurance coverage for transition for state employees, even though the same treatments may be covered for non-transition purposes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a finicky idea to explain and I'm not very good at it. Gender is how you feel about your own sex. Usually it lines up with your body because usually your brain lines up with your body. There's definitely a social aspect to it too though, because we're social animals and like it or not what people say about us and how they treat us is very important to our self image. If we think that only the sex assigned at birth can be correct and must define us because that's what we're told, then that's hard conditioning to break. There's some element of it therefore that's biological, and some that's social. 

The choice argument of it is more complicated (this isn't really my area of expertise), but it's similar to sexuality. If some guy really wanted to for some reason, he could choose to have sex with dudes even though he's straight, and eventually cultivate taste and come to like it. But if he chose to do that, was he really straight in the first place? By the same logic, if a guy chooses to live as a girl and eventually becomes comfortable with it, was that a choice or was it a discovery? It gets really murky and self-referential at a certain point, and I'm no rocket philosopher. </TEXT>

There's a physical difference in the brain, it reflects structures of the sex of the gender they identify as. Left untreated, that disconnect between brain and body can cause dysphoria, which is a mental illness, but fortunately we have the capability to alter the body to better match the brain. </TEXT>

Plenty of people think that they're straight because it's the normal thing, but they're not happy with it and at some point they realize they're bi or gay. They don't exactly *become* gay, they just realize that they are. </TEXT>

I assume that's supposed to be "gender". Gender has foundations in biology; there are physical differences between the sexes and gender usually lines up with sex, but the fact that different societies have different gender roles and indeed different genders means that a large component of gender is socially influenced. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, dysphoria is the mental illness, but that's born of a serious discomfort or anxiety with having a body that doesn't match your brain. There's a physical difference in the brain of a trans person; it has structures like those of the sex of the gender they identify as.

Being trans isn't a mental illness, but failure to get proper treatment can lead to or aggravate a very serious mental illness.

Now that that's out of the way: children don't undergo surgery or hormone treatments. The most they get is puberty blockers around 8 or 9 (which is reversible if need be), and then HRT from around 16 at the earliest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well it's not something that you choose. But there definitely is evidence that gender identity has social influences. The ancient Greeks recognized more than two genders, much of Asia today still does. 

Plus it's not like the brain is binary, *strictly* male XOR female. Nothing is that clear-cut. Some are more male, some are more female. But social pressure definitely has some influence; people suppress their identities if they're made to believe it's wrong somehow, and the same thing sort of goes for people who might fall somewhere between male and female but don't have a way of expressing that and just sort of go to one end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the Olympic level, they call for two years IIRC, with continuous testing. But that's a max time case; for people who have been building muscle for years and who have massive incentive to cheat the system by skirting some treatments, and with quite a large margin for error.

For someone who has been on hormones for a significant portion of their life, the bar is lower because there just hasn't been time for muscle mass to develop. Plus, Safe Harbor has long been a policy in most sporting leagues where competitors who have a medical need for something that is normally banned undergo testing to ensure that they aren't cheating; the issue of controlled substances and medicine in sports is one that's been pretty well established already because there are many medical conditions that fall under that umbrella.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a college student, so she hasn't had decades of muscle mass development. Even if she had, it takes two years of hormones within a normal female range to eliminate any advantage that gave her (mind you that's a conservative estimate the IOC made for people who trained their whole lives; in actual fact it can be much quicker).

As for bone structure, that depends on her treatment; if she was on puberty blockers and later hormones from a fairly young age, that wouldn't have developed like a man. And while there have been no long-term studies that I know of confirming this, because the skeleton is constantly being broken down and regenerated like pretty much every other part of the body, I suspect that after enough time even bones would be changed by hormone replacement. </TEXT>

[From the author of that study](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2014/09/10/puberty-suppression-benefits-gender-questioning-teens-study):

"Since **puberty suppression is a fully reversible medical intervention**, it provides adolescents and their families with time to explore their gender dysphoric feelings, and [to] make a more definite decision regarding the first steps of actual gender reassignment treatment at a later age," said study lead author Dr. Annelou de Vries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Using hormones on children is not standard practice; that's why hormone blockers are used instead. Blockers merely prevent the body from processing certain hormones, which is far safer and easier to reverse than hormone replacement; they can be used to prevent puberty from starting at around 8 or 9 years with very little risk. While there is some debate over long-term effects this treatment can have in very young people, current medical consensus is that they are the best treatment available today. </TEXT>

Worth mentioning is that due to the small sample size, this shouldn't be taken as a representative result; it's possible this is an outlier case.

As for the brain development, a trans person's brain is physically like that of the sex of the gender they identify as. So far as I know nobody has figured out why, but body just doesn't line up with the brain sometimes.

<TEXT> DNA is not the sole determining factor in biological sex. In fact it's the one least often used to make a determination. There are physical characteristics that are used to make that determination as well, and they don't always point to the same conclusion.

The brain of a trans person is physically not the same. They reflect structures like those in the brains of the sex of the gender they identify as. That's not a mental disability, that's physical.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rules aren't bent for her any more than they are for anyone else. Safe harbor is pretty common; it means if you have some condition that requires hormone treatment (which is something that cisgender people have too), so long as you're tested to ensure that you don't exceed certain benchmarks you're eligible.

As for the second point; it's true. Muscle mass is very much dependent on hormones, and HRT demolishes muscle mass. Really the only thing that doesn't change is her skeleton, and if she's been on puberty blockers/hormones from an early age (which I don't know, doesn't seem to be the case here from what I read) even her skeleton would be substantially different from how it would have been without intervention. </TEXT>

"Oh, goodbye women's sports!" Yeah, sure. To date there have been two, maybe three trans people to make it to the Olympics. That number would be more like 30 *every year* if trans people had no advantage or disadvantage at all. Yet one person on a rowing team at one school is trans and people think that all sports has gone to hell. </TEXT>

ICO, the terrorist organization seizing territory in the Middle East is clearly the show's version of ISIS the terrorist organization seizing territory in the Middle East. Petrov, President of the Russian Federation is clearly Putin, President of the Russian Federation. Clearly the writers of the show like it when the show's complications line up with those of reality.

So let's look at what happened in Season 3: the loss of a senior member of the Supreme Court. Jacobs, of course, retired because he knew he had Alzheimer's disease. This leaves a space on the bench during just before the election, something we have currently. But this happened in the show without any such counterpart in the real world, so the producers realized that in order to keep their complications in line with those of reality, a senior Justice had to leave.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the obvious choice, as she is the oldest current member of the Supreme Court and there has been some pressure for her to retire. But a liberal justice leaving the court would be much more complicated than a conservative justice, since a conservative justice's replacement can be fairly moderate which is easier than Ginsburg's replacement would be. So in order to allow the plot to move forward but still be reasonably correct, it would have to be a conservative justice in the real world.

Roberts is chief justice, so he's obviously out. Alito was nominated by W, so he's too new. That leaves Thomas, Kennedy, and Scalia. Thomas is, let's face it, not known for his wit and sharpness like Jacobs, so we're down to Kennedy and Scalia. Kennedy is more controversial than Scalia; yes Scalia is outspoken and witty, but he's consistent while Kennedy is a little more unpredictable. Kennedy isn't particularly conservative, so his replacement would be difficult just like Ginsburg's.

So it's Scalia. He's sharp like Jacobs, old like Jacobs, and has health issues like Jacobs (not the same issues, but issues nonetheless). We don't know how Jacobs leaned politically, but we know he was liked and respected by people on both sides of the aisle. And while Scalia was deeply conservative he was also well liked and respected.

So the producers offed Scalia. It wouldn't be that hard to make it look natural; he's old and fat and has a heart condition. And they get the biggest circus they could ever want. I'm not saying that it's canon yet, but nothing says it isn't possible and quite a lot of things say it is. Just something to think about.

TL;DR: The title. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] [SONG] Title and artist for a track that samples from the Space Jam theme music </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-07 08:07:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As far as I can tell, the sampling is from the beginning of the original song "Everybody get up, it's time to slam now, we got a real slam going down. Here's your chance do your dance at the space jam, all right"

The track is about 120 bpm, very much a dance track, and the sampled bit is sped up to match and used throughout. As far as I can tell, that's the only part that's taken from the original. 

[The original](https://youtu.be/J9FImc2LOr8). It's possible that other parts from the woman's vocals are used, but all I know for sure is that the first eleven seconds or so are. 

Also I will follow up if I can, but I'm on mobile and can't set flairs.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Meta] Can this sub not devolve into just shitting on the GOP? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-29 06:02:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I get it. Reddit doesn't like Republicans. I'm not a fan of the party either, but y'all are really stretching the intent of this sub.

[This](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/democrats-havent-moved-farther-than-gop.html) article was fine. It's headline is quite obvious to pretty much any American.

[This](http://chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Republican-senators-only-like-federal-relief-when-6292025.php) article really isn't okay for here. This isn't something that is obvious, it's just being posted to further someone's message. Also, I suspect, if the headline read "Democrats Don't Care about Gun Owners Except in their Own States", it wouldn't have been posted, never mind getting to the top. 

I'm not in favor of banning political posts, as some really are appropriate for this sub, such as " Campaign heats up as Election draws near", "GOP wants to dismantle Obamacare", "Democrats plan more taxes, more gov't spending", " Treasury Dept Concerned with Stability of Dollar", or indeed the actual article mentioned at the beginning of this post. Nobody can force you to look at both sides of an issue, but at least try and think if the headline is actually obvious before you post.

Thank you for reading through this. 

And for those that didn't, TL;DR: Don't just shit on Republicans, see if the article title is actually obvious or if it just confirms a bias that you have.

<TEXT> A few years ago I went on vacation with my family, and one of the places we stopped was Wall Drug, SD. I'm not sure why that part is important, but that's where we were and I'm not going back to rewrite it. Anyway, we were in one of the restaurants and a French-Canadian family was seated next to us. (I assume they were Canadian because French people typically don't make a road trip to South Dakota. On a related note, that's why the fact we were in Wall Drug was important.)

Now, I don't like to generalize like this, but typically when a group of tourists are in America speaking something other than English, they tend to speak it loudly, confident that nobody will understand them and that nobody will call them out for it. This family was certainly not an exception; if I recall correctly there was a heated debate over how much to tip and how they were going to split the bill. It was quite annoying, and quite drawn out.

As we were getting ready to leave, someone told some joke and my uncle couldn't stop laughing. The Canadians were giving us dirty looks and I felt the need to apologize as I went past.

Dsol I said Je sais qu'il est pnible quand on peut pas couter  son propre penses.

Roughly translated that's *Sorry, I know it's annoying when you can't hear yourself think.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking to pick up a hobby and buy a bike because I figure that it'll give me something to do and also save me some money on gas in the summer. However, I don't have a whole lot of experience wrenching and I want something that won't be too intimidating to work on. I only have two main requirements other than that: I have a budget of around two grand and the bike must be able to do interstate speeds comfortably.

If anybody knows of a better place to ask this, do let me know. </TEXT>
