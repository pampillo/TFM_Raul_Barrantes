<TEXT> I've [been arguing](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/z/d9kctvb) that the US has been flirting with banana republic status since the federal policeled by one James Comeysaw fit sabotage Clinton's presidential campaign 11 days from the vote. That action compromised the integrity of the election. 

This is just a further step down that pathaway from democracy and the rule of law, and toward authoritarian rule by the powerful and well-connected, according to their corrupt whims.

Today's step was brought to you by the Orange buffoon who sits the throne. But he only sits there because of Comey's earlier arrogant meddling and violation of investigatory norms designed to protect against this very thing.

<TEXT> Let me push back on this. The Rosenstein memo is a pretextual attempt to backfill the legal rationale for Trump's earlier, already-formulated decision to fire Comey. In other words, Trump didn't decide to fire Comey based on the memo's recommendations. I'd be surprised if Trump has the attention span to even read it. Rosenstein cites Comey for improprieties that Trump praised and shamelessly exploited during the 2016 campaign. So, in that sense, the memo is a lie. Procedurally, it also doesn't have factual findings, citations to precedent, or other indicia of a rigorous investigation and anlysis (like I presume the I.G. report will).

Yet, as far as legal rationales go, Rosenstein's substantive conclusions concerning Comey's misconduct are spot-on (with the exception of some weasel wording that may give Trump an opening to try to argue to his base that Comey was fired for clearing Clinton). Comey shat on normal investigatory protocol, torched long-standing norms concerning disclosure of ongoing investigations, and ran the Clinton email probe according to his whims. And then, to top it off, he made false statements to Congress last week in an attempt to justify it all. 

Obviously this has nothing to do with why Comey is being canned *now*.  If this were genuinely why Comey was going to be fired, he should have been fired on January 20th, or October 29th, or July 6th. This firing reeks of cover up.

But Comey's supreme self-assurance and lack of care at multiple stages of this process *did* give Trump the opening he needed. And that now has the potential to bite us all in the ass. With a bit more humility on his part, this Orange buffoon wouldn't even be President. 

Hopefully Comey will meditate on tremendous damage he's inflicted on this country during his unexpected unemployment.

Thanks Comey.

<TEXT> The world is a complicated place.  As [I said today before Comey's firing](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6a2v0h/z/dhc8p6t):

It doesn't have to be black or white.

It ~~could~~ can simultaneously be true that: (1) Comey badly mishandled Clinton email investigation; and (2) Comey ~~will~~ would have looked into the Trump-Russia affair more thoroughly than anyone Trump could possibly appoint.

Trump obviously has just been waiting for an excuse to do this. He reportedly asked Sessions (who should not have participated because of his earlier recusal from anything related to Russia) to find a rationale for the firing.

My educated guess is that Sessions or Rosenstein must have gotten wind of the preliminary findings of the ongoing Inspector General investigation of Comey's actions during the election. Rosenstein's memo probably tracks those findings so it looks like they were ahead of the curve. And that's possibly how Trump thinks he can beat this and distinguish Comey's firing from the Saturday Night Massacre. If the I.G. also finds misconduct, Comey's prextextual firing looks more defensible.

By making false statements to Congress last week and doubling down on the idea that he didn't do anything wrong with the editorializing or letter, Comey further weakened himself.

The irony here is that although Comey *probably did* commit fireable misconduct, he should have been fired on July 5, or October 28, or possibly January 20not now, while he's investigating Trump. Beyond the highly suspect timing, the legitimate rationale is totally incoherent and hypocritical in light of Trump's shameless exploitation of Comey's improper disclosures during the campaign.

I hope this won't be able to derail the Russia election interference investigation. Perhaps the reestablishment of the investigatory norms that Comey violated, which Rosenstein explicitly mentioned in his memo, will now be used to shield the dirty shit Comey's potentially uncovered about Trump's connections to Russia.

Imagine that the DoJ, at Rosenstein's discretion or that of a special prosecutor he selects, declines to pursue criminal charges against Trump Regime officials. All the investigatory material would be shielded from public view. Thats why a special prosecutor is not enough. There needs to be an genuine Congressional investigation by a bipartisan select committee, or else an independent comission, with full access to the FBI/DoJ's investigatory files. Anything less than that, and these bastards could.get away with this.

Dear Director Comey:

I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.

**While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions. that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.**

It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.

<TEXT> This claim was [rated 3/4 Pinocchios in a WaPo Factcheck](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/05/09/trumps-pointing-of-the-finger-at-obama-for-failing-to-vet-flynn/?utm_term=.4fd5ec6d2914) yesterday:

---

[Trumps pointing of the finger at Obama for failing to vet Flynn]

... **Flynns clearance was a routine matter**, said Jim Kudla, a DIA spokesman. **Flynn had left the agency but the practice there is that all former DIA directors should keep a clearance so the current director is able to have a discussion with former directors about classified matters that might require insight from a previous director.**

**Flynns clearance at DIA comes up for renewal every five years, and so in January 2016, he filed the necessary paperwork. Kudla said the clearance was** ***only for Defense Department matters.*** **It was not so General Flynn could go to other agencies asking for classified information, he said. Each agency would be required to determine whether to allow access to classified materials.** ***Kudla noted that at the time it was being renewed, early in 2016, he was not in the political sphere he subsequently became.***

Flynn in February told CNN he had been advising Trump on a range of issues. At one point, Trump even seriously considered tapping him as his running mate.

As part of the clearance renewal, Kudla said, an applicant is asked about foreign travel and foreign contacts. Kudla said that **there are a couple of questions about foreign financial interests, such as stock investments, but asking about payments for a foreign speech is not part of the clearance process.**

Separately, he noted, Flynn as a former Army officer is supposed to receive permission from the secretary of the Army and the secretary of state before accepting payments from foreign governments. Flynns lawyer has said that as part of the clearance review he disclosed his attendance at a 2015 event in Moscow organized by Russia Today, a government-linked news organization that U.S. consider to be a propaganda front. **But lawmakers have charged that Flynn probably broke the law when he did not disclose $45,000 that he received from RT.**

Most of the security clearance process deals with questions of character and trustworthiness (though it also includes consideration of possible foreign allegiance), said Steven Aftergood, director of the project on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. **It does not address questions of competence or policy judgment. He noted that in light of concerns about Russian election-tampering, General Flynns record of interactions with Russian entities took on a new significance that they did not have in 2015.**

White House officials acknowledge that ***Flynn was still awaiting a CIA clearance when he was fired by Trump***. At the time he was fired, Flynn had an interim clearance in order to allow him to do his job.

I know what I went through as a political appointee twice, in a Republican and a Democratic administration, said James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, in testimony on May 8. **And the vetting process for either a political appointee or someone working in the White House is far, far more invasive and far, far more thorough than a standard TS/SCI clearance process. (TS/SCI refers to Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information, the clearance level Flynn held at DIA.)**

---

Flynn retained his routine clearance as a former head of the DIA and was able to renew it in April 2016. This clearance related only to DoD matters, and existed mainly for the benefit of later directors of the DIA. He did not have general clearance to request classified info from other agencies, such as the CIA or NSA. And he was never given the highest level of clearance for political appointees and White House staff, which was required for him to serve as the [National Security Advisor](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/332399-flynn-never-completed-cia-background-check-for-trump-white-house-job-report). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Putting aside the national security implications, this is also terrible politics. 

McMaster is universally respected on both sides. If Trump continues to undermine or sideline him, McMaster could simply resign in protest. The press and public opinion would almost certainly side with him. 

That would be a canary in the coal mine moment for the Trump Regime, and they'd struggle to find a replacement of comparable stature. Of course, that would leave the ideologues with free reign--and we'd have to survive that interim period without the world ending. But this is the sort of event, like the Saturday Night Massacre, that can quickly get out of control and topple a Regime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you 100% about the gravity of the situation--and am not brushing off the seriousness of subverting our elections by any means. It's a hostile act, arguably an act of war that's on same spectrum as staging a coup to overthrow the government. 

But we can't--and shouldn't--attack Russia militarily. It would pose an unacceptable risk of escalating into WW3 and ending human civilization. A mutual defensive pact like NATO strikes the right balance because it doesn't obligate interlocking alliances to join in their allies' offensive wars (ala WW1), but takes away any advantage a potential aggressor, like Russia, would have to gain if it attacked any member of the alliance. After the two most devastating wars in human history, NATO has helped keep peace in Europe for almost seven decades through this basic mechanism.

A similar commitment from every democratic country to treat Russian cyber-attacks as attacks on their own sovereignty and democratic processes could work for the same reason.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if it's possible to completely sever them from the internet, and there would be various work-arounds. But we could conduct proportional counter-cyberattacks and escalate the economic sanctions--like cutting them off from western banks, targeting their financial and energy sectors with boycotts and tarriffs, possibly even looking at expelling them from the WTO. 

Russia has a fairly undiversified, highly petroleum export dependent economy. If there's a concerted effort to cut them off from the benefits of the international system they're trying to undermine, they will suffer disproportionately. This may encourage internal opposition to Putin or at least self-interested restraint on his part to avoid these effects. 

The key is to announce these retaliatory measures in advance and have it on an automatic (or credible) trigger if Putin does the thing that we pre-declare as unacceptable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There has to be some form of retaliation, preferably by NATO, for this ongoing campaign of Russian cyber attacks. Maybe amend the North Atlantic Treaty to specify that attempts to subvert democratic elections will be subject to Article 5.

I'm not saying military force should be usedbut this certainly warrants increased and coordinated sanctions, and possibly cyber counter-attacks on Russian IT infrastructure.

Announcing this policy publicly and following through if Putin persists with his campaign will raise the financial and domestic political cost to him and his allies of doing this in the future. That may help deter future cyber attacks.

If this continues to be costless, what does Putin have to lose? It won't always work, but when it does, he can sow internal political divisions among his adversaries, and if he hits the jackpotlike with Trumphe can tarnish their international reputation, obtain favorable policies, or damage them economically. Hypothetically, the US could even suffer a "lost decade" as the result of Trump's presidency if we get a full-blown trade war, recession, repeal of healthcare, and budget-busting tax cuts.

<TEXT> This isn't a distraction:

FBI Director James B. Comey said at a hearing last week that it made him mildly nauseous to think that he may have influenced the outcomeof the 2016 campaign.

New revelations about his apparently botched testimony are liable to make Democrats  and Comey a little more than mildly nauseous. And they are going todamage Comey's best defense of his actions.

The Post's Devlin Barrett has confirmedProPublica's reportingthat Comeymisstated key details of an investigation into HillaryClintonat a hearing last week.

Specifically at issue are Comey's statements that:

1) Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin forwarded hundreds and thousands of emails from Clinton's private email server to her husband, disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, as part of a regular practice of forwarding emails for Weiner to print out for Clinton, and 

2) These emails contained classified information.

Barrett reportsthat this first claim is just not true and the second one obscures the fact that the few classified emails weren't marked classified at the time:

Neither of those statements are accurate, according to people close to the investigation. The investigation found that Abedin did occasionally forward emails to her husband for printing, but it was a far smaller number than described by Comey, and it wasnt a regular practice, these people said. None of the forwarded emails were marked classified but a small number  a handful, according one person said  contained information that was later judged to contain classified information, these people said.

To be clear, these weren't just small details that emerged from Comey's testimony on Wednesday; they weretheheadlinefor manynew outlets that covered Comey's visit to the Senate Judiciary Committee, including The Post.


They werealso keyto Comey's testimony, in that he used them to defend his decision to disclose the new Clinton emails just 11 days before Election Day. Facing questions from Democrats about why he did what he did, Comey cited these facts as proof of the seriousness of the email discovery and the need to say something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well Comey explicitely [sic] had told a Senate panel that Abedin broke the law and there were laws about them not sharing classified materials with civilians, which she did. 

And Comey cited **lack of criminal intent not that what she did wasn't illegal** as the reason they weren't prosecuting. **Considering our legal framework claims ignorance of the law is not an excuse I'm pretty sure she was let off the hook.**



You're conflating two distinct concepts: (1) **mistake of law** and (2) ***mens rea***.

Mistake of law would be doing something unlawful while sincerely believing it's legal. This is almost never a valid defense outside of some very specific situations that are irrelevant here.

*Mens rea*, on the other hand, is the [culpable mental state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpability) that [**must exist concurrently**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrence) for a voluntary action to constitute a crime. 

People who arent legally-trained often dont understand that a criminal offense consists of **both** an *actus reus* (a voluntary wrongful action) **and** a requisite degree of *mens rea*. Even criminal statutes that don't explicitly mention mental culpability are construed to contain a *mens rea* requirement. [*See*, *e.g.*, *Morissette v. United States*]( https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=787130527265701764 q=342+U.S.+246,+251 hl=en as_sdt=2006), 342 U.S. 246 (1952) (Crime, as a compound concept, generally constituted only from concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand  As the states codified the common law of crimes, even if their enactments were silent on the subject, their courts assumed that the omission did not signify disapproval of the principle but merely recognized that intent was so inherent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory affirmation.)

Indeed, almost every misdemeanor or felony has a *mens rea* elementwhereas certain "strict liability" infractions, like speeding tickets, don't. This is an essential protection of substantive criminal law, and is encapsulated by the Latin maxim:

*Actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea*

Which translates to:

 An act does not make a person guilty, *unless the mind is guilty*.

Many people understood that Clinton (or Abedin) had committed a crime but "got off" on some technicality, when in fact the absence of *mens rea* completely negates the crime. 

Intent, as used in this context, doesn't mean you need to intend to violate the law. It just means that you must be **aware of** and **consciously disregard** a substantial and unjustifiable risk that you are disclosing classified information, or else *knowingly or purposely* disclose classified information. 

That's not the same as negligence*i.e.* you *should have known* that you were risking careless or inadvertent disclosure of classified information.

By declining to refer the investigation to a prosecutor (which Comey isn't), Comey was saying that there was insufficient evidence of the requisite *mens rea* to even indict on the charges, let alone establish them beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction.

In other words, no crime. Although, possibly, rules, guidelines, or best practices for information security may have been violated. There may be some civil remedy for that. But that's different from a crime.        </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a huge storyfar from a distraction from today's bad headlines for Trump. We need to have bandwidth for this as well.   

Comey relied on Abedin's misstated conduct portray the significance of the supplemental investigation that precipitated his letter.


So this is a fairly important thing to get wrong under oath. From the article:

FBI director James Comey generated national headlines last week with his dramatic testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, explaining his incredibly painful decision to go public about the Hillary Clinton emails found on Anthony Weiners laptop.

Perhaps Comeys most surprising revelation was that Huma Abedin  Weiners wife and a top Clinton deputy  had made a regular practice of forwarding hundreds and thousands of Clinton messages to her husband, some of which contain classified information. Comey testified that Abedin had done this so that the disgraced former congressman could print them out for her boss. (Weiners laptop was seized after he came under criminal investigation for sex crimes, following a media report about his online relationship with a teenager.)

The problem: Much of what Comey said about this was inaccurate. Now the FBI is trying to figure out what to do about it.

**FBI officials have privately acknowledged that Comey misstated what Abedin did and what the FBI investigators found.** On Monday, the FBI was said to be preparing to correct the record by sending a letter to Congress later this week. But that plan now appears on hold, with the bureau undecided about what to do.


The idea that Comey and the FBI don't know how to deal with correcting Comey's testimony is also notable. This is not routine correction for a wrong date or figure. It goes, at minimum, to Comey's basic understanding of what happenedhis stated basis for sending the letter that tipped the election. Accordingly, it could potentially even raise issues in the ongoing Inspector General investigation of Comey's pre-election conduct and handling of the Clinton email investigation.

ProPublica is reporting a story on the FBIs handling of the Clinton emails and raised questions with government officials last week about possible inaccuracies in Comeys statements about Abedin.

It could not be learned how the mistake occurred. The FBI and Abedin declined ProPublicas requests for comment on the directors misstatements.

<TEXT> Sooner or later, we will have universal, single-payer health care in this country  sooner if Republicans succeed in destroying the Affordable Care Act, later if they fail.

**The repeal-and-replace billpassedby the House last week is nothing short of an abomination. It is so bad that Republicans can defend it only by blowing smoke and telling lies.** You cannot be denied coverage if you have a preexisting condition, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.)said true in the narrowest, most technical sense but totally false in the real world, since insurance companies could charge those people astronomically high premiums, pricing them out of the market if, as often happens, they let their coverage lapse. There are no cuts to the Medicaid program, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Pricesaid a bald-faced lie, given that Republicans want to cut$880 billionfrom Medicaid in order to offset a big tax cut for the rich.

...

**I cant think of a more effective way to drive the nation toward a single-payer system.** In their foolish haste to get rid of Obamacare, Republican ideologues are paving the way for something they will like much less.

...

**When President Barack Obama decided to tackle health care, he chose a framework that had been developed at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation.** The ACA is based on what began as Republican ideas: **maintain the basic system of employer-based health insurance provided by private-sector companies; set up exchanges to service the individual market; provide subsidies to help the working poor afford insurance; expand the reach of Medicaid; guarantee reasonably priced coverage to those with preexisting conditions; and impose an individual mandate to ensure that younger, healthier people either buy insurance or pay a fine.**

Its a complicated scheme but it can work, as Republican Mitt Romney proved when he enacted a similar plan as governor of Massachusetts. And because the ACA maintained the basic private-sector structure of our health-care system, Obama reasoned that surely it would win some GOP support in Congress.

He was wrong. Only Democrats voted for the ACA, and Republicans turned its repeal into a partisan crusade  leading, eventually, to Thursdays vote.

I have always believed, however, that **Obamawas prescientin seeing that the ACA would have a larger impact that would be difficult if not impossible to erase**, no matter what Republicans did to the law itself: **It established the principle that health care,** as Obamasaidin accepting theProfile in Courage Awardat the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on Sunday, **is not a privilege but a right for all Americans.**

**Ryan and other House Republicans obviously disagree**, but polling suggests they **are increasingly out of step with the nation**. In Gallups most recent survey, the ACA had an approval rating of55 percent, its highest to date. Perhaps more significantly,52 percentof those polled a few months ago agreed with the statement that it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care coverage, vs. 45 percent who disagreed  a sharp turnaround in the past couple of years.

Those majorities may seem less than overwhelming, but the trend lines are clear. If tens of millions of Americans lose their insurance coverage and the most popular provisions of Obamacare are nullified, how do you think opinion will evolve?

If nervous Senate Republicans refuse to walk the plank, Obamacare will remain in place. But President Trump and the GOP majorities in Congress now own the health-care issue, and if they dont stop trying to sabotage the ACA and instead try to make it work, voters will be angry. ... </TEXT>

Up till then, particularly while working under McChrystal, he had a model career and earned 3 starsno small feat. He was permitted to retire and discharged honorably. 

I imagine that the sort of offense for which your security clearance would be stripped would involve intentional mishandling of classified info or an offense for which you'd be dishonorably discharged in a court martial. 

I also would expect that security clearance would be a marketable asset for former military officers wanting to start or join private defense/security contractors after their retirement. There's probably a norm for not stripping security clearance unless there's something specific to justify it. Maybe that needs to be looked at.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I've argued before, a formal declaration of war isn't necessarily required. And I think there's a colorable case of treason to be made on this fact pattern without it. That's not to say that key terms wouldn't get intensely litigated and there isn't an easier charge to pursue for strategic reasons.

The Constitution sets the outer limit of what can be considered treason at [Article III, Section 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section3), which provides:

----------

Treason against the United States, shall consist ***only*** [1] in levying war against them, *or* [2] in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. **No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.**

**The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason**, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture ***except*** during the life of the person attainted. (Emphasis and numeration added.)

----------

The statutory definition of treason, codified at [18 U.S.C. 2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) pursuant to Congress's constitutional power to punish treason, defines the offense as:

---

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, [1] levies war against them *or* [2] **adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere**, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and **shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States**. (Emphasis and numeration added.)

---

Here, no one levied war against the U.S. (though some have called it an act of war), so we're left "adherence to the enemy, giving them aid and comfort"--a separate basis for treason.

Note that the key phrase "aid and comfort"which appears in both definitionshas a narrow, restrictive meaning. But it doesn't appear to require that Russia be a wartime enemy. In [*Cramer v. United States*, 325 US 1 (1945)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2809896451252158562 q="18+u.s.c.+2381" hl=en as_sdt=2006), the U.S. Supreme Court explained that:

---

 Treason of adherence to an enemy was old in the law. It consisted of breaking allegiance to one's own king by forming an attachment to his enemy. Its scope was comprehensive, its requirements indeterminate. It might be predicated on intellectual or emotional sympathy with the foe, or merely lack of zeal in the cause of one's own country. That was not the kind of disloyalty the framers thought should constitute treason. They promptly accepted the proposal to restrict it to cases where also there was conduct which was "giving them aid and comfort."

**"Aid and comfort" was defined** by Lord Reading in the Casement trial comprehensively, as it should be, and yet probably with as much precision as the nature of the matter will permit: **[a]". . . an act which strengthens or tends to strengthen the enemies of the King in the conduct of a war against the King, that is in law the giving of aid and comfort"** *and* **[b] "an act which weakens or tends to weaken the power of the King and of the country to resist or to attack the enemies of the King and the country . . . is . . . giving of aid and comfort."** Lord Reading explained it, as we think one must, in terms of an "act." It is not easy, if indeed possible, to think of a way in which "aid and comfort" can be "given" to an enemy except by some kind of action. Its very nature partakes of a deed or physical activity as opposed to a mental operation.

**Thus the crime of treason consists of two elements: [1] adherence to the enemy; and [2] rendering him aid and comfort.** A citizen intellectually or emotionally may favor the enemy and harbor sympathies or convictions disloyal to this country's policy or interest, but so long as he commits no act of aid and comfort to the enemy, there is no treason. On the other hand, a citizen may take actions which do aid and comfort the enemy  making a speech critical of the government or opposing its measures, profiteering, striking in defense plants or essential work, and the hundred other things which impair our cohesion and diminish our strength  but if there is no adherence to the enemy in this, if there is no intent to betray, there is no treason. (*Numeration and emphasis added*.)

---

From this definition, it doesn't seem like a state of war is necessarily required, because aid and comfort also encompasses overt acts which "weake[n] or ten[d] to weaken the power of the ... of the country to resist or to attack the enemies of ... the country." 

The key term that would be litigated, I think, is "enemy," which isn't defined. Generally, that means you'd use the ordinary meaning. 

Merriam-Webster [defines enemy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enemy) as:

1:  one that is antagonistic to another; especially :  one seeking to injure, overthrow, or confound an opponent

2:  something harmful or deadly 

3

a :  a military adversary

b :  a hostile unit or force

Under these definitions there are good arguments for deeming Russia an enemy for purposes of treason based on their subversion of the election. 

Alternatively, you have the definition of enemy at [50 U.S. Code  2204](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/2204), which states:

As used in this chapter [*i.e.*, [Chapter 39 of Title 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-39)]

...

(2) the term enemy means any country, government, group, or person that has been engaged in hostilities, whether or not lawfully authorized, with the United States;

(3) the term person means

(A) any natural person;

(B) any corporation, partnership, or other legal entity; and

(C) any organization, association, or group

By its own terms, this definition does not control uses of the term "enemy" in Title 18 (where the statutory definition of treason appears)--only Chapter 39 of Title 50. But assuming this definition *did* control Title 18, the meaning of "enemy" depends on the meaning of the word "hostilities," which is not defined in the statute. 

So we'd again go to the plain meaning. 

Merriam-Webster [defines hostilities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hostilities) as:

a :  deep-seated usually mutual ill will 

b

(1) :  hostile action

(2) hostilities plural :  overt acts of warfare :  war

2:  conflict, opposition, or resistance in thought or principle

There's a decent argument under the plain meaning that "hostilities" does mean "overt acts of warfare." So if the 50 U.S.C.  2204 controls, you might be able to defeat treason charges provided that subverting an election isn't an act of war. 

Under either meaning of the term "enemy," but especially the first (non-statutory), it's not clear that Russia would be held *as a matter of law* NOT to be an enemy for purposes of treason. I haven't done a comprehensive overview of the caselaw on this issue, but I don't see anything in *Cramer* suggesting otherwise. 

If Russia isn't precluded as a matter of law from being an "enemy," I think that there's a good argument to be made that emnity can be inferred from a factually intensive inquiry into the nature of the act itself--especially if we go with the first plain meaning of enemy as "one seeking to **injure**, **overthrow**, or confound an opponent." 

This understanding of enemy is fully consistent with *Cramer*'s definition of aid and comfort as "weake[ning] or ten[ding] to weaken the power of the ... of the country to resist or to attack." And subverting an election for the highest federal office arguably meets this test--provided there was an explicit *quid pro quo* to secure illicit Russian campaign assistance (and possibly funding) in exchange for U.S. foreign policies desired by Putinincluding a weakening of NATO, the U.S.'s principal military alliance, and consequent impairment of the U.S.' ability to "resist or to attack [its] enemies."

The agreement to subvert our election would also likely satisfy the "**adherence to the enemy**" element of treason (which could be further inferred from the delivery of pro-Putin policies detrimental to U.S. national security and use of the hacked information knowing that it was unlawfully obtained and disclosed under this illicit deal). Enacting pro-Putin policies and speaking favorably of Putin would likely satisfy the overt act of "**aid and comfort**" element. Russia has long been an adversarial power, and the hostile act of subverting our democratic election to promote its objectives and weaken our principal defensive military alliance would likely be sufficient to establish **emnity**. So assuming you had **two witnesses** to the overt acts, you might be able to convict for treason in the strict [18 U.S.C.  2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) sense. 

Of course, there are much easier charges to bring and prove. Bribery. Fraud. Conspiring to commit or aiding and abetting the computer hacking. Violation of campaign finance laws. Possibly espionage, as well as cover-up related charges.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To counter Russias online operations, we should adopt a strategy that focuses on two pillars: deterrence and resilience. Its essential both to discourage Russia from launching attacks and to harden our defenses for the next salvo.

Successful deterrence combines clear intentions and demonstrated capabilities. Put simply, we must articulate which Russian cyber-actions will trigger a response, and we must prove that our response will be very costly to the Kremlin.

The West can solve the first half of this equation by issuing a joint NATO-European Union declaration affirming that using cyber-subversion to undermine the democratic process of any member state will be treated as an attack against all. That way, the Russians will understand that the West intends to respond collectively and forcefully should their meddling persist.

The West can address the second half of the equation by agreeing to impose broad economic sanctions against Russia if its red lines are crossed. As a closed society, Russia is less vulnerable to political intervention than is the West. But Russias economy  feeble and dependent on the West  is an appropriate target.

The United States and Europe should go beyond the Obama administrations approach, which directed cyber-sanctions at the actual perpetrators of digital malfeasance, and plan to hit Russia where it hurts most: in its financial, energy and technology sectors.

The United States and the E.U. should broadcast that continued cyberattacks will lead to sanctions against Russian firms in those sectors  and they should agree on measures in advance so that sanctions can be enacted swiftly when needed. If Moscow knows that electoral interference will cause one of its largest banks to be blacklisted by the West  a move far more severe than any taken thus far on Russia sanctions  it will think twice before launching its next attack.

Meanwhile, the West must make itself more resilient to Russian attacks. The Homeland Security Department was right todeclareelectoral systems critical infrastructure in January. But Congress must take it a step further. This begins with supporting an independent investigation of Russian cyber-interference in the 2016 election. Thefactis that Russia tried to penetrate our election systems and influence the outcome. This is not a partisan issue. It is a threat to our national security that demands a thorough investigation.

Additionally, the White House should make it a priority for the government to share cyberthreat intelligence with the private sector. Many institutions that are critical to the functioning of our democracy, from media outlets to telecommunications firms, make tempting targets for Russias cyber-operators. They should not be expected to defend themselves against a nation-state foe such as Russia without proactive assistance from the U.S. government.

Social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter must also do more to prevent Russia from using their platforms as accessories of subversion. Facebooks recentpaperon information operations, which proposes ways to stem the spread of fake news, is a good start. The U.S. government should encourage these efforts, collaborating with social media firms to identify disinformation campaigns and to weed out fake news planted by foreign intelligence services.

With Le Pens defeat on Sunday, the West dodged a bullet. But if we proceed without a comprehensive strategy to counter Russias subversion, we may not be so lucky next time. The United States and Europe must act now to defend themselves against Moscows digital threat to democracy.

<TEXT> If there was a *quid pro quo* and direct coordination between the Trump Campaign and the Kremlin to subvert the election, in the process violating laws on bribery, prohibitions on foreign campaign finance, computer hacking, fraud, and possibly even treason, there'd be a great argument that the election itself was hopelessly tainted and should be anulled.

Possibly that annulment in itself would require a re-vote.

But even if not, it'd be worth challenging every governental action stemming from the tainted election as null and void. 

This would potentially invalidate every law, CRA-based repeal of administrative regulations, executive order, and Presidential appointment into question. If this made it up to SCOTUS, Gorsuch would under normal principles of judicial ethics have to recuse himself, since he has a direct stake in the outcome. Query whether he actually would.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Trump and Pence are impeached for the Russia affair, the idea that he'd nominate his successor would be highly objectionable, since they would presumably be tainted by the misconduct that got them impeached. And assuming it happens after Democrats potentially re-take the House, they'd be in a position to block the confirmation, which has to go through both the House and Senate.

Republicans won't want President Pelosi. So what should happen at that point is a bipartisan amendment to the Presidential Succession Act providing for a special election to fill the vacancy. Under Article II, Section 1, Clauses 4 and 6 of the Constitution, Congress has authority to pass a law to do determine who becomes President when both the Presidency and Vice-Presidency are vacant. That's where most of the current line of succession comes from. There's no need to go through elaborate process to put people in positions such as Speaker or President Pro Temp of the Senate so they can, in turn, ascend to the Presidency under the current law. Congress can and should simply change the law.

<TEXT> *Not only* did Obama fire Flynn (a yuge red flag), *not only* did Yates and Cummings warn the Trump Transition about Flynn, *not only* did the Trump Transition actually vet Flynn and discover the undisclosed foreign work and contacts, but Obama also *explicitly* warned Trump*in person*, during their *first meeting* after the electionnot to hire Flynn. 

And yetafter shitting on Obama's sound advicethe buck-passer-in-chief is still making half-assed excuses and trying to blame Obama for giving Flynn security clearance *before Obama fired him*.

Trump may actually believe he's never wrong, and he will never admit it even if he doesn't. But there's no way he can disown this decision in the eyes of the public.

<TEXT> Well, states *can* withdraw, but not after July 20 for a Presidential election taking place in the same year. Since the NPV compact is a binding inter-state contractual agreement, and the other states also gave something in value in exchange, it's fair to prevent unilateral disorderly withdrawalparticularly if the objective were to game the system at the expense of other signatory states who allocated their electoral votes in reliance on the other signatories' allocations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A compact is in fact a legally binding contract on a signatory state. And under the federal Constitution, states can't pass laws retroactively impairing contract rights, which is what a law purporting to withdraw a signatory state from the NPV compact outside of the terms of the withdrawal provisions would do. If a state were to try to enact a law that conflicted with the compact's withdrawal procedures, the other signatory states could sue it to seek a court order compelling specific performance or the compact.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> IN SEPTEMBER 1941,the German army drove Soviet power from Kiev, the capital of the Soviet republic of Ukraine. The Nazi secret police, the Gestapo, took over the building that had housed the Soviet secret police, known as the NKVD. Natives of Kiev soon appeared to denounce their neighbors to their new Nazi masters, just as they had done under Soviet rule.

The main enemy defined by Soviet power before the war had been the Polish spy, so Kievans informed on neighbors of Polish origin. Under the Nazis, the enemy was the Jewish communist, and so now it was Jewish neighbors who were in peril. The two regimes, different in so many ways, were alike in their cultivation of, and indeed their reliance upon, denunciation.

**The scene seems distant, the perpetrators exotic. But are we so different? If we could denounce our neighbor with impunity, would we recognize the danger to ourselves?** Denunciation is a great temptation. You can destroy lives on a whim.

**Our own Department of Homeland Security has just announced an American denunciation program, known as the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office.** The stated purpose is to aid the victims of undocumented migrants.VOICE declaresthat any person who is affected by criminal activity allegedly perpetrated by criminal aliens in the United States should consider himself or herself victims of immigration crime. An online form encourages Americans to name names and check off the violation that best applies from a list that ranges from benefits fraud to terrorism  and includes other. Did you have additional businesses/individuals to report on? the questionnaire concludes.

**Did you catch the trick? Did it strike you that the due process of law had been abandoned in favor of classic denunciation politics? Or did you accept that the person doing the denouncing was automatically the victim, and the person being denounced automatically a criminal?** There is no reason to believe that someone is the victim of a crime just because he or she goes online and denounces a member of an officially stigmatized group. **In a country where the rule of law prevails, it is the courts that decide whether a crime has been committed.**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aprilwas the safest monthin the history of New York City. Murdersare down 13 percentcompared to this time last year. Last month saw 20 homicides, versus 28 in April 2016. Overall, the city has seena 5 percent declinein serious crime from last year  and New York had already achieved historicallylow crime in 2016.

NYPD officials attribute the most dramatic drops to precision policing, where cops identify crime patterns and investigate and target the key offenders. Police build strong cases over time with the goal of making meaningful arrests  quality over quantity  that more often lead to prosecution.

And as officials promoted New York as one of the safest big cities in America, they managedto quietly throw shadeat the Trump administration. Last month, the Justice DepartmentdescribedNew York City as soft on crime in a memo warning so-called sanctuary cities that they risked losing funding for failing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read your comment. Will respond at length when I get in front of a computer later.

Will just note a few things for now.

First, the link to my comment re: ShareBlue was an error on my part. I copied over the link when responding to someone else's comment to a sepparate article. I actually intended to link to this Chicago Tribune article:

[FBI leaders knew about new emails for weeks before Comey letter](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-emails-investigation-20161102-story.html)

Second, there's plenty of evidence that Comey's actions affected the election. 

[Ive argued the point at length](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2) and it seems clear to me that letters effect was decisive. Its actually harder to see how the letter *didnt* matter than how it did, when a swing of just 39K votes allocated among three states would have changed the outcome.  

[I'm not the only one](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/04/lets-talk-about-bubbles-and-james-comey) with [this assessment](http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/1/11/14215930/comey-email-election-clinton-campaign). [Not by a longshot](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/855798547505180673).

Here's Nate Silver's excellent, detailed article from yesterday:

[The Comey Letter Probably Cost Clinton The Election](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/?ex_cid=538twitter)

The fact that Comey's letter likely tipped the election doesn't, by itself, establish negligence. Rather, i contend that his failure to take adequate precautions after expressly acknowleging the "significant risk of being misunderstood" does that. I linked you to a detailed pre-election comment where I lay that out. You didn't respond substantively to the comment, and instead focused on your perception of my partisan biasincluding through your suggestion that ShareBlue and Rolling Stone are telling me what to think about Comey. 

Will continue discussion later. Thanks for reply. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 2010, Democrats who voted for Obamacare paid a huge price in the midterms. Just how big a price? **A2011 studyby FiveThirtyEight contributorSeth Masketand another political scientist, Steven Greene**, found that Democrats who voted for Obamacare lost 6.6 to 7.6 percentage points of the vote, depending on which model they used. Note, however, that these totals refer to theshareof the vote the Democrat lost and not to themarginthat the Democrat had against the Republican. Since third-party candidates are rarely major factors in House races, almost every vote the Democrat loses is one the Republican gains. **Thus, the effect on the Democratsmarginagainst the Republican was roughly twice that  13 to 15 percentage points. Thats a huge effect; it means that a Democrat who was on track to cruise to re-election by 12 points would lose if theyd voted for Obamacare.**

**Alater studyby Masket, Greene and three other researchers found impacts of a similar magnitude**, estimating a 5.8 percentage point Obamacare effect on the Democrats vote share using one technique, and an 8.5-point effect using another. Again, these are voteshares,not votemargins. (We usually think in terms of margins here at FiveThirtyEight). **The margins would be roughly twice as high  in the range of 12- to 17-point penalty for a Democrat who voted for Obamacare.**

**If Republican members should suffer a similar penalty for voting for the AHCA  somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 points  it could put dozens of GOP-held seats in play.** Some 33 Republicans won their seats by 14 percentage points or less in 2016Or in 2017 in the event of Rep. Ron Estes of Kansas, who won his seat in a special election last month.

Republicans in the next tier or two down could also be vulnerable, however, because the overall political climate is likely to be a lot worse for Republicans than it was in 2016. In 2016, Republicans won the aggregate popular vote for the U.S. House byabout 1 percentage point. Democrats currently have a 5- to 6-point lead inpolls of the 2018 House vote, however. Moreover, the numbers for the presidents partyusually get worseover the course of the midterm cycle as more voters tune into the political process. **There could easily be an overall partisan swing of 5 to 10 percentage points against Republicans, therefore**. **Its not quite clear how this partisan swing would interact with the AHCA penalty  whether youd add them together or whether thats double-counting  but it should be enough to make a lot of Republican incumbents nervous. There are 58 Republicans who won by less than 20 points inwho voted for the AHCA.**


...

Theres even a chance that Republicans could suffer a bigger penalty than Democrats did. Asunpopular as Obamacare wasas it was being debated by Congress in 2009 and 2010, the AHCA ismore unpopular still. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dead on:

House GOP leaders are confidently forging ahead with the repeal-and-replace vote today, and **they are laughing off questions as to why they would go forward despite their willfully premature and dim understanding of how the measure might impact millions of Americans and one-sixth of the U.S. economy.** They are doing this without seeing a nonpartisan analysis of their new bill from the Congressional Budget Office  which will, conveniently, allow them to conceal the full truth of what they are voting for from their constituents.

**But this is likely to backfire**. Heres why: The Congressional Budget Office score of the bill is coming, anyway  as soon as next week. And it will land after an untold number of House Republicans have committed themselves to the bill.

**This means moderate and vulnerable House Republicans who are already worried about explaining to their constituents why they voted for the bill"*  which guts protections for the sick and rolls back coverage for millions of poor and working-class people while delivering a huge tax cut to the rich  **will have to justify it again, in light of a nonpartisan analysis spelling out the grisly details of what they really voted for.**

...

If this happens, it will put moderate and vulnerable Republicans who supported the bill in an odd spot. They will be at home on recess, hearing from their constituents, and they will have to justify their vote for something that threatens to inflict all the harm that the new CBO score has now projected it will inflict.

**Whats more, they will also have to explain in retrospect why they rushed the vote in advance of a CBO score detailing its impact, even though it was only a few days away**  and is designed to help them make a more informed choice about what it is they were truly voting for. **At that point, though, it will be too late. They will already be on the hook for it.**

----

The CBO score will be a real problem. It frames the context and big picture. But even more problematic, narratively, for vulnerable Republican incumbents are the individual substantive provisions of the bill that lend themselves to compelling attack ads.

Besides gutting essential protections for pre-existing conditions by [making it unaffordable for anyone who actually needs to purchase coverage](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/04/21/431019/premium-increases-pre-existing-conditions-latest-aca-repeal-plan-state/) (and [exempting Congress from this change](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/4/15542314/republican-health-plan-loophole-exemption)), it was [reported by the WSJ just today that this bill also removes protections from employer health plans](https://www.wsj.com/articles/little-noted-provision-of-gop-health-bill-could-alter-employer-plans-1493890203) (which is how the mast majority of people get healthcare). Others have noted that the bill [cuts special education funding as well](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/health-bill-medicaid-special-education-affordable-care-act.html) by preventing schools from getting Medicaid reimbursement for services provided under [IDEA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act).

As people comb through the statutory language, expect to find more of these gems. If the AHCA clears the House today, it will be up to us to discover and hang them around the necks of every single Republican who backs this billregardless of whether it eventually becomes law. 

By voting for a bill packed with these cruel and ill-conceived provisions, they're giving a costly signal of their partisan loyalty and showing their willingness to put it above the needs and express desires of their constituents. How ever they try to excuse it in 2018, costly actions speak far louder than words. These Republicans can be depended on to fuck people over in the future.

Vote accordingly.

<TEXT> Also a response to /u/dfecht.

I *am* casting doubt on the propriety of  Comey's *observable conduct*. This is not revisionism. I've argued consistently, since [a week before the election](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/z/d9kctvb), that Comey's actions failed to comport with investigatory protocol and DoJ guidelines, fell short of the basic precautions and standard of care we'd expect from someone in Comey's situation facing the scenario he did, and evidence the application of a troubling, seemingly arbitrary double standard. 

I've *never* suggested and don't believe, however, thay Comey was in any way intentionally assisting or coordinating with Wikileaks or the Russian government. 

Rather, I interpreted the final part of the excerpted New York Times articlewhich I obviously didn't write, but *did* select and emphasizeas showing the concrete adverse consequences of Comey's failure to endorse the October 7 Statement. If Comey and the FBI had endorsed the Statement, and it we ere understood as reflecting the unanimous assessment of the IC, there would have been significantly less tolerance for Trump's sophistry concerning the perpetrators of the hacks. It's notable that the Statement was put out on the very day that the Podesta email dumps beganabout an hour after the the Access Hollywood tape leaked.

Further, the timing is also significant given that Comey's rationale for not endorsing the Statement was that October 731 days from the electionwas too close and politicized, even though the Statement didn't specifically mention that Russia was helping Trumpa fact known at the timeor disclose the existence of the FBI's collusion investigation. Recall that the first letter to Chaffetz was sent on October 2811 days from the election. Evidently, in Comey's inscrutable judgment, that *wasn't* too close to the vote, even though [the FBI had known about the emails since early October](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-emails-investigation-20161102-story.html). 

As for Comey's motives, I don't really care as much. It seems like one could prove culpable negligence at a minimum. We know, based on his own internal memo to subordinates (which, of course, leaked), Comey sent the letter to Chaffetz knowing full-well that the letter would likely leak. He contemplated and accepted the risk and that it could influence the election. Yet, he failed to take even basic precautions to minimize the damage such a leak could do. Such precautions would not have required the disclosure of investigatory or classified information. If he felt compelled to say something, he could simply have said, "there's approximately X number of emails, Y/X are duplicates of emails that we have already reviewed, and we anticipate based on the established rate of review that the new emails will take Z days."

De-duplication is not complicated with modern off the shelf e-discovery software. Moreover, Comey would not have breached any ethical duty to supplement his Congressional testimony by waiting until a preliminary review had taken place first. All that his purposely vague initial letter did was fuel speculation and innuendo. Trump promptly seized on the resulting uncertainty to play up wildly-exaggerated scenarios where Clinton was about to be arrested. This had a measurable effect on the polls *while people were already voting*.

As noted, the way Comey handled all of this didn't only violate basic investigative practices and common sense, but it was also against long-standing DoJ policies. Indeed, the very fact that Comey's actions did break so drastically from normal protocol fueled further speculation about the gravity of what might be in the laptop emails. 

Now, if you ask me to speculate on further motives or aggraving characteristics, I think that Comey's legendary [self-righteousness](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/opinion/campaign-stops/james-comeys-self-righteous-meddling.html?smid=tw-nytopinion smtyp=cur) and obsessive [fixation with *appearing* impartial and protecting his reputation](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-the-fbis-james-comey-fumbled-the-clinton-email-probe-w447597) probably played a role, and are more persuasive than Comey merely being a run-of-the-mill partisan hack.

It's more convenient than dealing with Cyrillic text to refer to his title,    (Gubernator of the Trumpistan Oblast).

And his formal style in English is bit of a mouthful:


[**Donald John "Yugehands" Trump, *il Douche* of Orange**](https://m.imgur.com/a/nArsi), the first of his name; the Tremendous; the Unschackled and Unpresidented; Commander-in-Chief and Emperor of the United States; Supreme Leader and Lord Protector of the American Empire; Tribune of the People and Speaker of the House; Senator for Life and President of the Imperial Senate; Chief Justice of the Emperor's So-called Bench; Registrar and Scourge of Muslims; Spinner of Tales; Builder of Walls; Deporter of Mexicans; Breaker of Budgets; Grabber of Pussy; and Restorer of Greatness.     </TEXT>

If the [whip counts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/01/upshot/health-care-vote-whip-count-comparison.html) are accurate, we need 4-5 more GOP voteswith over 30 GOP members still having undecided/unclear public positions. Of those undecideds, 22 are members of the more  moderate Tuesday Group or else are from districts that Clinton won, and 2 are Freedom Caucus holdouts, [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/01/us/politics/health-care-whip-count.html?_r=0) (which has the most conservative/pessimistic whip count). 

**Bottom line:** ***we can do this***. 

The public is on Democrats' side. Call your Rep if they are potential GOP votes against this, or even if it's just to thank them for standing firm. Overload the Congressiinal switchboards. If this can be defeated in the House a second time, the damage to the Orange One's legislative agenda going forward could be profound. And even if they ram it through in the House, they're voting their seats away. So don't give up even if things momentarily seem dark.

<TEXT> The FBI's leakiness doesn't provide any justification for Comey's actions. If anything, it calls his management of the Bureau into question. You don't make decisions that important on the assumption that your subordinates will mutiny and undermine you. Comey should have followed through with the proper investigatory protocol and held leakers accountable after the fact if they leaked. 

The tone of mainstream coverage would be completely different, with less coverage focusing on the extraordinary nature of Comey's actions being an indication of a shoe about to drop for Clinton. And the impropriety of the leaks would become apparent once the email review was complete. If Comey did this and Clinton still lost because of the leaks, it would not have been because of his misconductas it is now.

<TEXT> A criminal conviction and up to a year in jail for laughing at the elf. Yet the elf still hasn't been called to task for his perjurious testimony. MAGA, I guess?

A jury on Wednesday convicted three Code Pink activists on charges related to a protest at the confirmation hearing of Jeff Sessions for attorney general  including a Virginia woman who said all she did was break out in laughter.

Each of the three protesters faces up to 12 months in jail, $2,000 in fines, or both, depending on the outcome of a June 21 sentencing hearing.

The woman with the laugh, Desiree A. Fairooz, 61, of Bluemont, Va., said she was undeterred. Well face the music when we get to that, she said.

A two-day trial in District of Columbia Superior Court in Washington ended on Tuesday. All three had pleaded not guilty, rejected a plea deal and demanded the trial.

In an April court filing, the office of the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia had argued that all three protesters shared a common goal to impede and disrupt the hearing. Ms. Fairooz, the office said, had created a scene.

It was early in the hearing when Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said that Mr. Sessionss record of treating all Americans equally under the law is clear and well-documented, Ariel Gold, the campaign director of Code Pink, said on Wednesday.

Ms. Fairooz said that, on hearing that, she let out a giggle.

I just couldnt hold it, she said on Wednesday. It was spontaneous. It was an immediate rejection of what I considered an outright lie or pure ignorance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for correcting. And sorry that I was a bit curt initially. I'm frustrated with the effort by some to lionize Comey.

His decision regarding the October 7 is puzzling to me. I don't know if he was pressed on it today. But the too close to the election justification rings hollow and is incoherent in light of his later actions. 

I wonder if it was contrarian petulance. In other words, "I didn't get to do it my way, so I'm not going to do it your way either." He seems to have an inflated and self-righteous sense of his own judgment and importance. Even if it wasn't retaliating, if he decided to not endorse the October 7 statement for some idiosyncratic reason and wouldn't take feedback from others who thought it was a good idea, I find that pretty inexcusable.   </TEXT>

That failure put him in a position of giving testimony and potentially having to supplement it when the laptop emails were discovered.

He made a discretionary judgment, and it was miscalibrated. When you are utterly convinced of your own integrity, refuse to take input, and think know better than anyone else, that tends to happen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, but that's revisionist bullshit. **Comey wanted to write an op-ed where** ***he*** **personally warned of Russian interference**. But he later refused to endorse the [official October 7 statement from ODNI and DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national)supposedly because it was too close to the election. And he persisted in this stance even after Trump used the FBI's non-endosement to call the validity of the October 7 statement into doubt.

Here's a [key excerpt from the April 22 NYT piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/us/politics/james-comey-election.html?_r=0 referer=https://t.co/gU4pdevSXc):


As the F.B.I. plunged deeper into that investigation, Mr. Comey became convinced that the American public needed to understand the scope of the foreign interference and be inoculated against it.

**He proposed writing an op-ed piece to appear in The Times or The Washington Post, and showed the White House a draft his staff had prepared**, according to two former officials. (After the Times story was published online on Saturday, a former White House official said the text of the op-ed had not been given to the White House.) **The op-ed did not mention the investigation of the Trump campaign, but it laid out how Russia was trying to undermine the vote.**

**The president replied that going public would play right into Russias hands by sowing doubts about the elections legitimacy.** Mr. Trump wasalready saying the system was rigged, and if the Obama administration accused Russia of interference, Republicans could accuse the White House of stoking national security fears to help Mrs. Clinton.

**Mr. Comey argued that he had unique credibility to call out the Russians and avoid that criticism.** After all, he said, he had just chastised Mrs. Clinton at his news conference.

***The White House decided it would be odd for Mr. Comey to make such an accusation on his own, in a newspaper, before American security agencies had produced a formal intelligence assessment. The op-ed idea was quashed. When the administration had something to say about Russia, it would do so in one voice, through the proper channels.***

...

[B]y fall, the gravity of the Russian effort to affect the presidential election had become clear.

The D.N.C. hack and others like it had once appeared to be standard Russian tactics to tarnish a Western democracy. After the WikiLeaks disclosures and subsequent leaks by a Russian group using the name DCLeaks, agents and analysts began to realize that Moscow was not just meddling. It was trying to tip the election away from Mrs. Clinton and toward Mr. Trump.

**Mr. Comey and other senior administration officials met twice in the White House Situation Room in early October to again discuss a public statement about Russian meddling**. But the roles were reversed: Susan Rice, the national security adviser, wanted to move ahead. **Mr. Comey was less interested in being involved.**

At their second meeting, ***Mr. Comey argued that it would look too political for the F.B.I. to comment so close to the election, according to several people in attendance. Officials in the room felt whiplashed. Two months earlier, Mr. Comey had been willing to put his name on a newspaper article; now he was refusing to sign on to an official assessment of the intelligence community.***

Mr. Comey said that in the intervening time, Russian meddling had become the subject of news stories and a topic of national discussion. He felt it was no longer necessary for him to speak publicly about it. **So when Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, and James R. Clapper Jr., the national intelligence director, accused Russias senior-most officials on Oct. 7 of a cyber operation to disrupt the election, the F.B.I. was conspicuously silent.**

***That night, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of hacked emails from another source: the private email account of John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign.***

<TEXT> At least two problems with that.

1. Trump made an issue of the FBI's conspicous non-endorsement of the October 7 statement in order to cast doubt onto the validity of the underlying Intelligence assessments upon which that statement was based. Comey remained silent thtoughout this. That gave a misleading impression.

2. Again, the supplemental testimony from Comey via the letter was given at his discretion. Putting aside the question of Comey only being in that position due to his earlier improper editorializing, Comey could have easily relied on standing DoJ policy to rebut any charge of impropriety had he first waited to complete the review of additional emails or at least done a preliminary review to exclude duplicates. The extraordinary nature of Comey's own actions became evidence that something extraordinary was about to happen (when in reality it just showed his gross departure from investigatory norms).

As we know, nothing new came of the investigation. But even if you look at it with foresight, rather than hindsight, Comey should have been much more concerned with the two to three week delay in briefing him after the emails were discovered on the laptop. That delay was potentially enough time to complete a full reviewwhich took 9 days, including obtention of the warrant. Delaying the start of the review caused the letter to be far more damaging than if it had been sent in early October. Comey needed to factor the timing of his letter far more than he appears to have done.

<TEXT> Some people do question it.

But beyond that, the "it shouldn't even have been close" line of criticism is asinine. We live in a closely-divided country. Partisan tribalism is a thing. And to top it off, this would have been the third term for the Democratic Party, which historically is a very difficult feat to pull off (Clinton actually outperformed the vote share one would expect based on the historical average dropoff and Obama's 2012 vote share by 2.9%). Likewise, the polisci models based on fundamentals (rather than polls) had the race as a tossup to a slight GOP advantage.

If Clinton would have managedin the absence of Comey's interferenceto win slim but a hard fought victory and retake the Senate in the process, that should have been the outcome. 

Comey's actions improperly thwarted the conclusion to which the election was building. If we believe in free democratic elections as the way to choose our leaders, that should trouble us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm linking to a comment containing citations and further elaboration of the point.  

You're wrong about the Trump investigationwhich is itself a misnomer here because what would have been disclosed is Russia's interference, not the investigation into the Trump campaign's potential collusion.

Obama didn't think it was appropriate for Comey to write a newspaper op-ed on his own concerning Russian interference. Yet, it was Comey who refused to sign on to an October 7 statement by the ODNI and DHS attributing the hacks and interference campaign to Russiasupposedly because 31 days was too close to an election (but the letters 11 and 2 days out apparently weren't).  

From [the NYT piece cited in the comment you take issue with](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/us/politics/james-comey-election.html?_r=0 referer=https://t.co/gU4pdevSXc):

This is incoherence at best, and pure hypocrisy or an improper ulterior motive, at worst. Comey could just have said, "actually, we agree with this assesment," because he did agree. Yet, he stood by and did nothing while Trump used the FBI's non endorsement to cast doubt on the statement. This is the precise reason its why Comeys refusal to defer to others is so dangerous. Were at the mercy of his whims, and that undermines the rule of law.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> What we already know doesn't justify Comey's actions. Quite the opposite. The [deep-dive NYT piece on Comey from April 22](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/us/politics/james-comey-election.html?_r=0 referer=https://t.co/gU4pdevSXc) lays out the key problem:

Mr. Come[y] ... handled [the two investigations] in starkly different ways. **In the case of Mrs. Clinton, he rewrote the script, partly based on the F.B.I.s expectation that she would win and fearing the bureau would be accused of helping her. In the case of Mr. Trump, he conducted the investigation by the book, with the F.B.I.s traditional secrecy.**

Essentially, Comey erred by editorializing at the July 5 press conference and only exacerbated this error with other decisions he made. Comey actually would have been doing the the right thing by not disclosing the FBIs counterintelligence and criminal investigations of Trump*provided he had afforded Clinton the same by-the-book treatment*. Having made extraordinary disclosures about the Clinton investigation, which he shouldnt have done to begin with, Comey now arguably had an obligation to make further disclosures about Trump in order to ensure that what he had said about Clinton would not be misleading. Instead, Comey allowed Trump to perpetuate a narrative that Comey knew was false and was enabled by Comey's selective disclosures.

I don't think Comey is a garden variety partisan hack who pulls for one team or the other. Rather, he looks out for himself and what he perceives the FBI's interests to be. Over time, he has carefully cultivated a reputation for being impartial and he guards that reputation zealously*too zealously*, to the extent he forgets that his reputation isnt an end in itself. I think his press conference was an attempt to show his work and try to establish that he had reached his decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution based on the merits of the evidence he considered, without outside political pressure.

This strategy backfired spectacularly. 

Not only was Comeys decision criticized anyway, but he provided powerful ammunition to Clintons opponents when he criticized her for what he characterized as extreme carelessness. Rather than reassuring Republicans that he was not carrying water for the administration and Clinton, the fact that he was so willing to commentwhen investigators *almost never* do in these situationscreated the appearance that there *had indeed* been interference, either because people independently reached different conclusions than Comey (which doesn't mean that Comey's decision not to recommend prosecution was unreasonable), or because they inferred that Comey might be signaling that Clinton *had* committed crimes but his hands were somehow tied. 

Compounding matters, people who arent legally-trained often dont understand that a criminal offense consists of [**both**]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrence) an *actus reus* (a voluntary wrongful action) **and** a requisite degree of *mens rea* (culpable intent). Even criminal statutes that don't explicitly mention intent are construed to contain a *mens rea* requirement. [*See*, *e.g.*, *Morissette v. United States*]( https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=787130527265701764 q=342+U.S.+246,+251 hl=en as_sdt=2006), 342 U.S. 246 (1952) (Crime, as a compound concept, generally constituted only from concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand  As the states codified the common law of crimes, even if their enactments were silent on the subject, their courts assumed that the omission did not signify disapproval of the principle but merely recognized that intent was so inherent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory affirmation.)

This is an essential protection of substantive criminal law, and is encapsulated by the Latin maxim:

*Actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea*

Which translates to:

 An act does not make a person guilty, unless the mind is guilty.

What many people understood from Comey's extraordinary press conference was that Clinton had committed a crime but got off on some technicalitywhen in fact the absence of *mens rea* completely negates the crime. Put differently, Clinton didn't *unintentionally* "commit a crime"which requires a criminal conviction upon proof, to a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, of all the elements of the offense, *including* culpable intent. 

People yelling "lock her up!" or calling for Clinton to be disqualified from the election based on her purported criminality were basically calling for punishment without a criminal indictmentlet alone a trial. 

The Trump campaign did everything to encourage this misunderstanding of criminal law and procedure. And the strategy was highly effective politically. Recall that the aftermath of the Comey press conference was [the first time Clintons poll numbers sank sharply](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/#now), and that they didnt fully recover until *after* the Democratic National Convention. At one point, Trump took the only lead of the campaign in the 538 forecast, which is further indirect evidence of how much Comeys letters (and the media's sensationalist coverage of them) likely mattered.  

Just as importantly, the press conference presented all this derogatory information about Clinton outside the context of adversarial legal proceeding where it could be challenged and various defenses could be presented. 

Now, this is the sort of procedural issue that might concern a lawyer a lot more than a non-lawyer. But think about what you'd want to happen if you were in the shoes of the person being investigated. Would you want the FBI using its coercive investigatory powers to obtain evidence, ultimately finding that the evidence *wasn't* enough to warrant a criminal referral, yet still publicly criticizing your alleged actions that, *by the FBI director's own admission*, could not support a criminal indictment? 

This is basically what Comey did. **At his discretion.** And it was wrong.

**In his capacity as FBI director, Comey is not a prosecutor. Hes more like a senior federal police detectivean investigator**. Investigators almost always dont disclose derogatory information about the subjects of their investigationsthat is, unless and until theres a public indictment *by a prosecutor* who relies on the information. Comey had every right to give his most brutal assessment to the prosecutor with jurisdiction and ultimate discretion of whether to pursue charges against Clinton. But its not Comey's place to publicly scold *anyone* for admittedly non-criminal conduct. These rules and norms exist to ensure due process and curb the immense potential for [abuse](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-09-08/entertainment/9103070622_1_hoover-legendary-fbi-director-secret-files) through extrajudicial disclosure of investigatory or surveillance information.  

Riley Robert's excellent profile of Comey, from September of last year, is worth reading in full because its turned out to be prescient of the pitfalls of Comeys obdurate[e] self-assur[ance]:

[The Case Against James Comey](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/james-comey-fbi-accountability-214234)

Having fueled a firestorm of innuendo with his extraordinary press conference, Comey was then hauled before Congress multiple times to give testimony, where he further discussed investigative information that would normally not be disclosed absent an indictment. And when the laptop emails came to light months afterward, he felt compelled to supplement his initial testimony (again, at his discretion, because it was not required and against DoJ guidelines, in any event). Comey shouldn't be excused for the later errors when they were brought about by his earlier self-righteous defiance of investigative protocol. 

All of this is made worse by double standard in how the Russian hacking and investigation into potential Trump campaign collusion were handled. 

Recall that Comey specifically refused to sign the FBI onto the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) [statement on October 7, 2016 that publicly attributed the attacks to Russia](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement)even though he agreed that Russia was behind the hacks and [had wanted to write an Op-Ed to that effect](http://www.newsweek.com/fbi-director-james-comey-russian-tampering-election-576417)supposedly because the October 7 statement was being issued too close to the election. But recall that 3 weeks later, to the day, from the initial release of the October 7 statement on Russian interference (which didn't explicitly say the interference was to help Trump), on October 28, Comey sent the letter that sabotaged the Clinton Campaign. **Apparently 11 days wasn't too close to the election, but 31 days was.**  (Whatever Comey's motives, his decision to do this against others insistent advice embodies the "I know best" attitude that I  find absolutely infuriating.) 

The DHS/ODNI statement even [came up at the third debate on October 19](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-blames-russia-putin-wikileaks-rele/) and Trump questioned it in front of millions of people. 

Despite now vowing to do [everything in his power "identify, investigate and then call out foreign efforts" to influence an election](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TRUMP_RUSSIA_COMEY?SITE=AP SECTION=HOME TEMPLATE=DEFAULT CTIME=2017-04-13-12-52-45), Comey couldn't even be bothered to say a quick "actually, the FBI agrees with the October 7 statement" to refute the disinformation and innuendo Trump was spreading by mischaracterizing the FBI's non-endorsement of the statement as an indication that it was unreliable.

<TEXT> Are you a foreign despot who has just purged his opposition or authorized a deadly war against your nation's drug dealers? Normally, you would expect at least a mild rebuke from the leader of the free world. Depending on how egregious your violations, maybe even a tough speech from the Rose Garden or a U.S.-sponsored United Nations resolution.

Not anymore. In the Donald Trump era, it's springtime for the world's authoritarians. ...

...

It's clear that much of this is improvisational. After the first 100 days, all of us are getting used to a president who says and tweets whatever is on his mind, regardless of how it coheres with his administration's foreign policy. We saw this previously when it came to Russia's political influence operation last year. Trump this weekend told CBS News that hestill wasn't sureRussia was behind the hacking of leading Democrats (even though he had acknowledged as much before his inauguration).

... [A]ny argument that Trump really cares about human rights or democracy in foreign policy is undermined by his sweet words for Duterte, Erdogan, Sisi and China's leader, Xi Jinping.

Past presidents have also looked the other way at times for authoritarian allies. And often presidents who made support for human rights a rhetorical priority didn't back up those words when it came to policy.

The difference is that when former presidents cozied up to authoritarians, there was a strategic purpose. Obama needed Egypt to be stable while its neighbor Libya descended into civil war. Clinton wanted North Korea to agree to a deal to abandon its long-range missile program. Franklin D. Roosevelt needed Stalin to defeat Hitler. With Trump, it's unclear whether his obsequiousness to despots is part of a larger plan or just popping off. </TEXT>

Hopefully, Democrats will oppose nuking it without going on the record with public statements that make it hard to abolish going forward. The filibuster makes Congress dysfunctional and our politics less accountable (it's easy for the electorate to blame the majority for the opposition's obstruction, as happened in the 2010 midterms). The only twinge of regret I have is at seeing the abolition happen under Trump--rather than a normal Republican or Democratic President. But if it takes Trump to finally be rid of this anachronism, then so be it.  </TEXT>

In any event, even the 5 people you counted as potentially black would be well under the percentage of non-whites in the U.S. electorate.

<TEXT> Love her or hate her, as a citizen, Clinton is totally within her rights to speak out against the Orange One. 

She got 2.86 million more votes than him despite her campaign being targeted by Russian interference (with potential coordination by the Trump campaign) and sabotaged at the last minute by James Comey's improper letter while people were already voting. 

If she were more personally popular, she'd be a natural leader who the resistance would look to. But regardless of Clinton's popularity, her criticisms of Trump during the campaign were spot on (including about Russia), she trounced him in all 3 debates, and so she should not be dismissed by anyone who genuinely opposes Trump. 

Whether you'd vote for Clinton again (or at all) is a totally separate question from whether she's worth listening to on the issue of why he's been disastrous for this country. And, in any event, she's said she's not running for anything in the future. 

Some might prefer Clinton to retreat from the national stage into obscurity. Strategically, that sentiment may not even be 100% wrongbut it's her call to make.   </TEXT>

*See* [Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei):


All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills.

Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, **before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States**; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a law.

**Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.**

*And see* [*INS v. Chadha*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2221871582286121199 q=ins+v.+chadha hl=en as_sdt=2006), 462 US 919 (1983):

The records of the Constitutional Convention reveal that the requirement that all legislation be presented to the President before becoming law was uniformly accepted by the Framers. Presentment to the President and the Presidential veto were considered so imperative that the draftsmen took special pains to assure that these requirements could not be circumvented. During the final debate on Art. I,  7, cl. 2, James Madison expressed concern that it might easily be evaded by the simple expedient of calling a proposed law a "resolution" or "vote" rather than a "bill." 2 Farrand 301-302. As a consequence, Art. I,  7, cl. 3 ... was added. 2 Farrand 304-305.

...

 We see therefore that the Framers were acutely conscious that the bicameral requirement and the Presentment Clauses would serve essential constitutional functions. The President's participation in the legislative process was to protect the Executive Branch from Congress and to protect the whole people from improvident laws. The division of the Congress into two distinctive bodies assures that the legislative power would be exercised only after opportunity for full study and debate in separate settings. The President's unilateral veto power, in turn, was limited by the power of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress to overrule a veto thereby precluding final arbitrary action of one person. ... **It emerges clearly that the prescription for legislative action in Art. I,  1, 7, represents the Framers' decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure**.

...

**Whether actions taken by either House are, in law and fact, an exercise of legislative power depends not on their form but upon "whether they contain matter which is properly to be regarded as legislative in its character and effect."**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> President Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered. He earned 59 Four-Pinocchio ratings during his campaign as president. Since then, hes earned 16 more Four-Pinocchio ratings.

But those numbers obscure the fact that the pace and volume of the presidents misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up. The presidents speeches and interviews are so chock full of false and misleading claims that The Fact Checker often must resort to roundups that offer a brief summary of the facts that the president has gotten wrong.

....

So here are the numbers for the presidents first 100days.

488: The number of false or misleading claims made by the president. Thats an average of 4.9 claims a day.

10: Number of days without a single false claim. (On six of those days, the president golfed at a Trump property.)

4: Number of days with 20 or more false claims.(Feb. 16, Feb. 28, March 20 and April 21.) He made 19 false claims on April 29, his 100th day, though we did not include his interview with Face the Nation, since that aired April 30.

With what I said:

The filibuster *isn't* a constitutional rule, but rather the consequence of **a rule and tradition created by the Senate**

Here's what the [Constitution has to say on the subject](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei):

Article I, Section 7

All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills.

Every bill which **shall have passed** the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. **If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill**, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the **other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a law.** But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively.

Article I, Section 5

Each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members, and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner, and under such penalties as each House may provide.

**Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings**, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.

<TEXT> No they wouldn't. The filibuster isn't a constitutional rule, but rather the consequence of a rule and tradition created by the Senate (the Senate is authorized under the Constitution to create its own rules, and eliminating the filibuster wouldn't change that). In fact, the way the GOP would kill the filibuster is by invoking the so-called nuclear option again  *i.e.*, raising a point of order saying that the Constitution only requires a simple majority to pass ordinary legislation in the Senate, and imposing a *de facto* supermajority requirement via the rule requiring 60 votes to end debate is unconstitutional. 

This argument isn't necessarily even wrong, just incredibly hypocritical after Republicans filibustered practically everything they could when Obama and Dems had unified control in the 111th Congress.       </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seems like the alleged perpetrator, Mitchell W. Adkins, may have mental health issues (self-reported depression 
supposedly stemming from other students not wanting to associate with him based on how he acted and the things he said around campus). But according to the article, during the attack Adkins asked people their party affiliation and let the Republicans go. If that's true, that makes this an explicit act of political violence.

Also per the article, he posted a [screed/manifesto concerning alleged discrimination he suffered because of his conservative views](https://www.buzzfeed.com/madkins19/discrimination-of-conservatives-in-liberal-arts-1ynfg?utm_term=.mmrK75a4Q3#.fdPM56W4wQ).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Horrifying. But at least [this guy](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/28/15/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-28499-1493408754-9.jpg?downsize=715:* output-format=auto output-quality=auto) didn't have a gun, and the people are likely to survive:

The suspect, who once wrote a BuzzFeed post about conservatives being discriminated against on liberal campuses, reportedly asked students about their political affiliations as he attacked them.


A former student of Kentucky's Transylvania University was arrested Friday after he allegedly stormed a campus caf with a machete and a bag of knives, quizzed students on their political affiliations, and injured two women.

**Mitchell W. Adkins** allegedly entered the cafe on the Lexington campus shortly before 9 a.m. local time before threatening patrons and employees, the Lexington Police Department said in a statement.

Two women suffered non-life-threatening injuries. One was taken to a hospital, while the other was treated and released at the scene.

Witnesses told local media the suspect shouted "The day of reckoning is here!" as he began his attack.

"He asked the first girl if she was a Democrat or a Republican. She said Republican. He said okay, then asked some other girl," Michael Soder told Lex 18. "By that time, some of my friends were running out and yelling for us to leave, and I tried to stay behind to see if  I mean I didn't know what to do, I wanted to help, but I knew I should get out of there."

"He asked somebody what their political affiliation was, they said Republican, and the guy said, 'You are safe,'" campus newspaper editor-in-chief Tristan Reynolds told the Lexington Herald-Leader. "And then I realized what was going on and started getting people out.

...

In 2015, after BuzzFeed staffer and Transylvania alum Tracy Clayton wrote a viral post detailing her experiences with racism at the university, Adkins wrote a post on this website as a community contributor. 

In the post, "[Discrimination of Conservatives in Liberal Arts](https://www.buzzfeed.com/madkins19/discrimination-of-conservatives-in-liberal-arts-1ynfg?utm_term=.wsMdaG2vE#.lcaJk6Gy7)," Adkins wrote of making "several enemies" because he is a "proud Republican."

"It's amazing to me that when I listen to someone's political opinion and then give my own, I'm the one who's lashed out at for being a 'racist' or 'bigot,' some even go as far as saying 'bane of society' or 'fascist Nazi,'" he wrote.

Adkins discussed losing friends because of his opinions on gay marriage and Caitlyn Jenner, and detailed his unhappiness with the student newspaper urging students not to wear racially insensitive costumes for Halloween.

"I am proud of who I am, but this school has shown me that it's not okay to be a Republican anymore," he concluded. "All of these people who are all about non-discrimination and against bullies and all for equality, are more than happy to turn around and scream at someone for being different, kick him to the ground, and leave him there. I am not the bigot at this school, it is those who go back on their beliefs in order to encourage them."

In a postscript, Adkins said he had later dropped out of college.

"The constant bullying and lack of friends drove me to an overdose, a trip to the hospital, and two trips to a mental hospital," he wrote. "The constant thought of knowing I'd never fit in was too much for me to bear."


On his Facebook page, where he first shared his BuzzFeed post, Adkins has written and shared a number of posts about his support for President Trump, his views on gun control, and his views on attacks committed by Muslims. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here's the link the the full story](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article146957349.html) in the News   Observer linked in this article. 

[Here's the bill itself](http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2017/Bills/House/PDF/H330v2.pdf), and the excerpt of the relevant provision:


 1-539.13 Immunity from civil liability for certain automobile drivers.

(a) A person driving an automobile who is exercising due care and injures another  person who is participating in a protest or demonstration and is blocking traffic in a public street or highway is immune from civil liability for the injury.

(b) A person shall not be immune from civil liability if the actions leading to the injury were willful or wanton.

(c) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply if the injured person participating in a protest or demonstration was doing so with a valid permit allowing persons to protest or demonstrate on the public street or highway where the injury occurred.


As I read it, subsection (a) immunizes drivers who are exercising "due care" from civil liability. 

I'm not a North Carolina lawyer, but I don't see how this represents an actual change from common law negligence. Maybe it sets up an affirmative defense of statutory immunity that can be invoked at an earlier stage of the case?

Generally speaking, if you fail to exercise due care while driving and injure someone, you can be held liable for negligence. What due care requires in a particular situation is obviously fact-specific and contextual. If you have a protester unexpectedly hop in front of you are, you are driving in normal traffic, and you try to stop but simply don't have time to do so, you almost certainly wouldn't be held liable even without this change in the law. That's different than the degree of care you might be required to exercise at a cross walk in a school zone while kids are present.

On the other hand, even with this change, if you don't even try to stop for the protester and you had time to try, you aren't exercising due care could be held liable. 

This law might simply encourage people--knowing that this immunity exists--to exercise less care than they otherwise would. But if they do that consciously, there's a decent argument that it's really recklessness not mere negligence. So the statutory immunity wouldn't protect them. 

There's also one potential ambiguity that I see. Subsection (b) says that someone isn't immune where they cause the injury through "willful or wanton" actions. So someone intentionally or recklessly running over a protester wouldn't have immunity. But that same subsection doesn't expressly say that someone who negligently runs a protester over (*i.e.*, failing to exercise due care but not quite being wanton/reckless--which requires an element of conscious disregard of risk) would also not be immune. 

This doesn't imply that they *would* be immune. But it invites litigation should that scenario ever come up. 

The bottom line is that this is a stupid and unnecessary law. There may be a basis to challenge it as unconstitutional under the First Amendment, or some other ground, for unfairly singling out just protesters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [They're joined at the hip now](https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/trumphandel.jpg) (put this image right into the attack ads). They foolishly decided to make this a referendum on Trump. Let's give them their wish:


Karen Handel is in the middle of what Republicans see as a must-win race for Congress. And at a fundraiser on her behalf on Friday, President Donald Trump made sure she knew it.

At the closed-door event at the Capitol City Club, Trump turned toward Handel with a smile and quipped youd better win, according to five attendees of the event. She responded that he need not worry about that.

...

Trump sent a barrage of tweets and recorded a robo-call last week urging Republicans to vote against Ossoff in the special election.

But he went a step further on Friday with glowing praise for Handel at a nationally-televised speech and a new attack on Ossoff at a National Rifle Association meeting in Atlanta. He followed that up with a private fundraiser for Handel afterwards.

Handel has embraced Trump right back. Although she did not run as a pro-Trump loyalist, she has increasingly relied on his support since her No. 2 finish in last weeks vote.

...

It was nice seeing Karen embrace Trump, said Phillips, who took the picture above. I think thats going to pay dividends for her. If Trump voters dont turn out in June, thats not good for us.

<TEXT> This is an important discussion.

Those sound like fairly centrist policy preferencesexcept single-payer, which is more progressive (at least here in the US). What strikes me is that I don't have any massive irreconcilable policy disagreements with you (from what I can tell so far at least).  Yet, voting for Trump never even crossed my mind (I voted for Sanders, then Clinton). Also, interestingly, there are planks in the [2016 Democratic Platform](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/papers_pdf/117717.pdf) on the issues of individual and corporate tax reform, controlling healthcare costs and implementing fixes to the ACA, infrastructure as well as cyber security:



For example, on Infrastructure and Cybersecurity, the Democratic Platform proposes:

 *Building 21st Century Infrastructure*

If we are serious about reversing the decline of the middle class, we need major federal investments to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and put millions of Americans back to work in decent paying jobs in both the public and private sectors. The climate emergency and the need to expand the middle class demand that we make the most ambitious investment in American infrastructure since President Eisenhower created the interstate highway system. We will put Americans to work updating and expanding our roads, bridges, public transit, airports, and passenger and freight rail lines. We will build 21st century energy and water systems, modernize our schools, and continue to support the expansion of high-speed broadband networks. We will protect communities from the impact of climate change and help them to mitigate its effects by investing in green and resilient infrastructure. We will address the backlog of deferred maintenance in our four key public land management agencies. And we will protect public health and safety by modernizing drinking and wastewater systems. These investments will create secure, good-paying middle-class jobs today and will substantially increase demand for American-made steel and other products manufactured in the United States. And by boosting economic growth in a fair and equitable way, and strengthening our long-term competitiveness, these investments will create many more jobs in the years to come. 

Democrats will also create an independent, national infrastructure bank that will support critical infrastructure improvements. This bank will provide loans and other financial assistance for investments in energy, water, broadband, transportation, and multi-modal infrastructure projects.

Democrats will continue to support the interest tax exemption on municipal bonds and will work to establish a permanent version of Build America Bonds as an additional tool to encourage infrastructure investment by state and local governments.

Furthermore, Democrats will fight to ensure resources and programs are adequately targeted to
provide economic development, job training, and critical infrastructure investment in areas of the
greatest need. 

For comparison, here are Clinton and Trump's positions on Infrastructure (I had to pull Trump's positions off the the interner archive because [he's taken the page down](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/an-americas-infrastructure-first-plan)).


[Clinton on Infrastructure](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/11/30/clinton-infrastructure-plan-builds-tomorrows-economy-today/)

[Trump on Infrastructure](http://web.archive.org/web/20161108080815/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/an-americas-infrastructure-first-plan)


------

*Cybersecurity and Online Privacy*

Democrats will protect our industry, infrastructure, and government from cyberattacks. We will strengthen our cybersecurity, seek to establish global norms in cyberspace, and impose consequences on those who violate the rules. We will do this while protecting the privacy and civil liberties of the American people. We will also ensure a coherent strategy across federal agencies by building on the Obama Administrations Cybersecurity National Action Plan, especially the empowerment of a federal Chief Information Security Officer, the modernization of federal information technology, and upgrades to government-wide cybersecurity.

Democrats reject the false choice between privacy interests and keeping Americans safe. We need liberty and security, and each makes the other possible. We will protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American peoplestanding firm against the type of warrantless surveillance of American citizens that flourished during the Bush Administration. We support recent reforms to government bulk data collection programs so the government is not collecting and holding millions of files on innocent Americans.

We will support a national commission on digital security and encryption to bring together technology and public safety communities to address the needs of law enforcement, protect the privacy of Americans, assess how innovation might point to new policy approaches, and advance our larger national security and global competitiveness interests.


[Clinton on Technology   Innovation](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/) (contains planks on government and private cybersecurity).


[Trump on Cybersecurity](http://web.archive.org/web/20161108080605/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/cyber-security) (also from Internet archive)

(Some of the other issues are too long to include here--just look at the table of contents).

I find it fascinating that we could see the election so differently despite these apparent potential areas of agreement. I'm trying to zero in on the reasons for why this is the case, rather than trying to criticize or lecture you for why you voted as you did (which you've said you regret). So I hope you don't take the questions below the wrong way. In order to avoid a situation where I'm basically interrogating you, I'll also share [*my own answers in square brackets*].

I followed the campaign closely and didn't really see anything to indicate that Trump favored any of the policies that you do or had  concrete substantive plans to address them. That;s maybe because we've one talked about these issues very generally and would actually disagree about specifics (for all I know, you might favor lower rates on the top tax brackets, for example). Trump's sales pitch always struck me as more personality, style, and culture-driven rather than based on policy. Either it appealed to you or you found it incredibly off-putting. For me it was the latter. Also, I thought there were lots of red flags that convinced me think he'd be disastrous even before he took officelike his divisive rhetoric, constant fabrications and disregard for facts, shady business history, and complete lack of preparation for the debates. 

**Did you see any of these things as red flags?**

**What made you trust or at least prefer Trump to Clinton?**

**Did you ever hear about Clinton's issue positions during the campaign?**

**What's your party affiliation?**

 [*I'm registered as a Democrat*]

**Did you want a change from Obama after 8 years?**

 [*I wanted continuity for Obama's policies and less Republican obstructionism, but I'm always open to genuine compromise where both sides give and gain something*]

**Do you generally approve of how Obama did as President?**

 [*I do, strongly*]

**What region of the country do you live in?**

[*I'm on the West CoastLA, specifically*]

**What generation do you belong to?**

 [*I'm on the border between Millennial and Gen X*]      </TEXT>

<TEXT> So President Donald Trump has discovered that being president is a hard job  harder even than being a reality TV star and real estate brand-builder.

...

This particular revelation may be shocking but it shouldn't be surprising. This is the man whoasserted before taking officethat "I could actually run my business and run government at the same time." And while he may have abandoned his "previous life" to some degree, he's still executive producer of "Celebrity Apprentice" (a role that byone estimateis paying him millions of dollars even now) and spends many a weekend golfing at Mar-a-Lago.

But more broadly, Trump's admission that presidenting is hard is just the latest in a long line of indications that Trump was yugely, massively unprepared for the office he sought last year. I don't think it's a stretch to say that he was more unprepared than anyone elected to the office before.

It's not simply a question of hisvarious flip-flopssince coming into office, but the sheer number of nontrivial issues on which he's admitted to having been oblivious.

Consider the litany of things that were apparently astonishing to the new president which would come as a surprise to no one who has paid more than a passing amount of attention to national and international affairs (or, having decided to run for president, started trying to get up to speed)..



[*See article for list of items*including NAFTA, NATO, Korean Peninsula politics, Healthcare, Trade in EU*]

...

...[T]his guy is president. That's kind of a big deal. And even the best-prepared new presidents have big learning curves on the job, making Trump's kind of mind-boggling. That would be concerning in and of itself, but then layer on the fact that he has largely surrounded himself with political neophytes at the most senior levels of his administration  like his daughter and her husband  and it sets up a dangerous and unpredictable situation.

<TEXT> GOP Senate gains are *not* a foregone conclusion despite the [highly unfavorable map](http://cdn.images2.rollcall.com/image/236cbdabf6ca9fc064f8372837707da7/author/2016/11/16213416/SenateLandscape2018.jpg). In the 1970 midterm, there were only 8 GOP seats up for re-election, compared to 25 Democratic seats. Next year is about the same, with 9 R / 25 D (2 I) seats up. 13 of the Dems in 1970 midterm were in Nixon states, versus 10 Dems in Trump states in 2018. Also, Nixon was much more popular than Trump is currently, at 58% approval. So it was in theory a significantly more favorable midterm environment for the GOP. Nevertheless,  Republicans only netted 2 seats in the Senate and lost 12 in the House. 

Looking at the current political environment and extrapolating, that seems like a best case scenario for Trump (barring some sort of terrorist attack).

Senate races are correlated with each other, not random and independent. In +9 D (or more) environment with Trump's approval in the mid-to-high 30s, Trump state incumbent Dems are probably safe. Cruz's seat in TX might even become competitive. It could also encourage [Corker to retire](http://www.wbir.com/mb/news/politics/sen-bob-corker-not-yet-ready-to-say-whether-he-will-run-for-third-term/432097887?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTVRreVptVTVZell6WXpGayIsInQiOiI0RjUybm1QSkhYOWFZOFppT1N2amp4THIxcDNtM3Rva3h1ZGVOSzFWK3NBYWM1Q1BnTjV5OG9oOGRTcFZqM1dydER3YXdsRUp1OVJwM0VLMDg3d3V1SjJlMUEwM2dhQkJobm5IQTM1TDI4MnREUytIdUZXcGtKM01pUHg2SjZoZiJ9) (he has not confirmed he's running when asked) or [Collins to run for governor of ME](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/politics/collins-maine-governor-run/).

Retaking the Senate will likely require a 1994- or 2010-level wave. That's difficult, but not impossible. Especially if the Trump-Russia investigations start publicly turning up fire.

Donald Trumps presidency is nearly 100 days old, and it feels more like 1,000.

**Watching him preside over theUnited Statesfor 100 days is akin to dealing with a newborn baby for three months. The late nights, unpredictability, the constant need for attention, the cryingits an eerie parallel.** More importantly, if Trumps first three months and change in office are an indicator of whats to come, it provides a measure of satisfaction to those of us who warned this would happen.

TheNever Trump Republicanswere united by a pledge never to support his candidacyone that was based on his behavior, his past, and our deep fears about that he would do if ever occupied the Oval Office. Those fears are now playing out.

<TEXT> The State Department plans to cut 2,300 U.S. diplomats and civil servants -- about 9 percent of the Americans in its workforce worldwide -- as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson presses ahead with his task of slashing the agencys budget, according to people familiar with the matter.

The majority of the job cuts, about 1,700, will come through attrition, while the remaining 600 will be done via buyouts, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the decision hasnt been publicly announced. William Inglee, a former Lockheed Martin Corp. official and policy adviser in Congress, was hired to help oversee the budget cuts and briefed senior managers on the plan Wednesday, the people said.

...

Current and former diplomats fear that the cuts will bite into the work of the State Department and undermine the voice of the U.S. overseas.

**Simply Mindless**

Just cutting without deciding what change you want to make is simply mindless, said Stephen Sestanovich, a professor at Columbia Universitys School of International and Public Affairs who served as U.S. ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union.

A new administration is right to look at what Cabinet departments do, but does it want the United States to do less in the world  and if so, exactly what? he added. Those are the questions that need to be answered before you make big cuts at State.

The planned jobs cuts come as the State Department is preparing a major reorganization of its work and mission. The rethinking is part of a process of asking if the State Department is set up to meet the needs of the next two decades after 16 years focused on counterterrorism following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to R.C. Hammond, Tillersons communications adviser.

<TEXT> I think it was only 8 GOP seats up in 1970 (rather than 10) and 13 of the Dems up for re-election were in Nixon states (compared to 10 Dems in Trump states in 2018). Also, Nixon was at 58% approval. So it was in theory an even more unfavorable environment. Nevertheless, the GOP only netted 2 seats in the Senate and lost 12 in the House. 

Looking at the current political environment and extrapolating, that seems like a best case scenario for Trump (barring some sort of terrorist attack).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This also means that whoever decides what the option is has effectively become the President, and Trump is mostly a figurehead whose power can be wielded indirectly. Trump can still presumably say no, but only if he overcomes their undue influence. That's really dangerous. There should always be a choice between at least two meaningful alternatives (as well as doing nothing).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed here. But the key issue is the scope of what's related. That will likely be litigated, and the law may evolve.

The question is whether there can be wholesale withholding of federal assistance for state law enforcement unless states agree to enforce federal immigration law. 

The first ACA case, [*NFIB v. Sebelius*, 132 S. Ct. 2566 (2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11973730494168859869 q=nfib+v+sebelius hl=en as_sdt=2006), which I cited above, seems on point here. 

SCOTUS ruled that states couldn't be compelled to adopt expanded Medicaid through the threat of withholding existing Medicaid funds:

Congress may use its spending power to create incentives for States to act in accordance with federal policies. But when "pressure turns into compulsion," ibid., the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism. "[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate." New York, 505 U.S., at 178, 112 S.Ct. 2408. That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.

Permitting the Federal Government to force the States to implement a federal program would threaten the political accountability key to our federal system. "[W]here the Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision." Id., at 169, 112 S.Ct. 2408. Spending Clause programs do not pose this danger when a State has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal 2603*2603 funds. In such a situation, state officials can fairly be held politically accountable for choosing to accept or refuse the federal offer. But when the State has no choice, the Federal Government can achieve its objectives without accountability, just as in New York and Printz. Indeed, this danger is heightened when Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because Congress can use that power to implement federal policy it could not impose directly under its enumerated powers.

One other possible distinction is that immigration implicates a federal regulatory power, not just the spending clause, though I'm not sure that alone is dispositive.

 I've not yet examined the order to see how the Judge arrived at his decision to grant the stay.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Hows about we ditch this stupid concept that our constitution applies to people differently based on your address within the USA and just accept that all of it, the parts we all like and don't like... apply to everyone

That notion isn't challenged by this decision. 

States can't deny federal constitutional rights. They can't enact legislation that contravenes federal law in an area of enumerated federal power like immigration. But States, per current SCOTUS precedent, also cannot be compelled to affirmatively enforce federal law using their own resources, whether directly, or through the threat of withholding federal resources to which they're entitled.   

Here, the issue is whether states can be compelled to enforce federal immigration law against their will using their own state-level resources, and whether they can be forced to engage in costly cooperation (paid out of state coffers) with federal enforcement. 

There's no denial of a federal constitutional or statutory right by a State. That's the distinction between, say, Kim Davis refusing to marry gays (a federal constitutional right under the 14th amendment). 

The law may well change in this area, but what sanctuary cities are doing leverages existing precedent on federalism created by judicial conservatives.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not accurate. 

The federal government does indeed have plenary power over immigration, and states can't make their own policy that contradicts federal policy in this area. For example, states can't change the eligibility criteria for federal benefits, or admit people to U.S. citizenship. 

At the same time, states *do* in fact have the right to not have their resources commandeered against their will, directly or through coercive withholding of federal funds, to enforce federal law. 

That's SCOTUS precedent laid down by the conservative push to revive federalism. *See*, *e.g.*, *Printz v. US*, and *NFIB v. Sebellius*.

<TEXT> Well, it supposes Flynn's ability to tell a tale that holds him solely responsible for any misconduct, and doesn't contradict the other evidence and testimony that's likely to come out. Flynn would also have to be willing to make the sacrifice. His reputation would be even more tarnished than it is now. And, as I noted in the post (in the slightly different context of *refusing to testify*):

Trump would need to depend on Flynn's loyalty and willingness to go to jail indefinitely to cover for him. Yet, Trump threw him overboard at the first sign of adversity and has been distancing himself ever since. Not very loyalty-inspiring.

In taking the blame, Flynn's calculus would be a bit different. Suppose Flynn attempts to portray himself as the sole wrongdoer, but his testimony is proven false. That's perjury, as well as obstruction of justice--and, [as a retired military officer still receiving pay](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2006/04/could_rumsfeld_courtmartial_the_retired_generals.html), it could potentially even subject him to military discipline. None of these things would be covered by the original pardon for the underlying misconduct. Trump would need to pardon Flynn again for the testimony-related offenses. Besides the heavy political cost of doing this, it too could be construed as, among other things, obstruction of justice, subornation of perjury, witness tampering, or bribery of Flynn by Trump. And if the false testimony were material to the ongoing investigation of Trump (it likely would be, or else why would he go to the trouble) that would be the ballgame as well. 

This is a very fine needle to thread. Especially without knowing what the FBI has and coordinating with the White House in advance (something which is surely being closely watched). How does Flynn know that Trump will actually pardon him for the perjury? For Flynn to be absolutely sure, Trump would basically have to preemptively pardon the perjury in advance of Flynn's testimony. But since pardons are public acts, that would give away that Flynn was about to lie for Trump. 

Suppose that Trump were somehow able to give Flynn credible assurance that he would pardon him if and only if Flynn's perjury were discovered and he were actually tried and convicted of perjury. What would that assurance look like? Trump has no inherent credibility. He's a pathological liar who will throw anyone under the bus to save himself. What guarantee would Flynn have that Trump's calculus wouldn't change down the line, or even that Trump would still be in power when the moment for the perjury pardon came? To make this deal work, Trump would have to give Flynn even more leverage over him than Flynn already has based on whatever damaging information he may know. Flynn would always be able to blackmail Trump, even if this arrangement could be coordinated and pulled off. It's simply too clever by half. 

If Flynn actually does have the goods on Trump, he's much better off persuading the FBI or Congress to give him immunity--which is evidently what his lawyer has counseled him and attempted to do.

<TEXT> Self- serving hypocrisy on full display:

States rights have long been a rallying cry for conservatives. The Trump administration cited its respect for the states in rescinding Obama administration guidance treating discrimination against transgender students as sex discrimination. Attorney General Jeff Sessions invoked the same principle in questioning federal consent decrees designed to ensure constitutional policing in cities such as Chicago and Baltimore. And when the Supreme Court relied on states rights to gut the Voting Rights Act, then-Sen. Sessions applauded the decision, calling it good news ... for the South. In earlier periods, states rights arguments were advanced to resist desegregation and federal legislation protecting workers and consumers.

But the Trump administration doesnt consistently respect the states, and nowhere is that more true than in its attack on sanctuary cities, in which it claims that states and cities choosing not to help enforce federal immigration law should be denied federal funding. On Tuesday, a federal court in San Francisco invoked the very federalist principles that President Trump and Sessions celebrate to rule unconstitutional Trumps executive order denying funding to sanctuary cities, one of the signature initiatives of Trumps first 100 days. The nationwide injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick, ruled that Trump violated the rights of state and local governments to make decisions about the deployment of their own resources. The Constitution, the court ruled, mandates that state and local governments be left to make their own judgments about what best serves the safety of their people. Like lawsuits by the states of Washington and Hawaii challenging Trumps anti-Muslim travel ban, the case demonstrates the value of our federalist system when one party controls the levers of federal power.

...

Cities and states have the right to so choose because the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which preserves state authority, bars the federal government from compelling states to enforce or administer federal laws. The Supreme Court has explained that states must have the ability to make autonomous decisions about deploying their resources, so the federal government cannot commandeer their cooperation in carrying out a federal program. Thats a principle conservatives have long championed. But now that they control Congress and the White House, they are less eager to honor its dictates, especially when they protect progressive cities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beyond the problems /u/Atheose_Writing noted, pardons can have some counterintuitive consequences:

People can invoke the 5th Amendment and refuse to testify because they cannot be compelled to incriminate themselves. Just like with immunity, however, a pardon eliminates the risk of criminal liability from the testimony. Thus, once pardoned, someone can no longer refuse to testify on this basis. Continuing to do so would subject Flynn to civil or criminal contempt of court. As Kim Davis learned, federal courts don't fuck around with that. You can be thrown in jail until and if you comply with the court order. So Flynn may end up spending some time behind bars after allalbeit in jail, not prison, and not as punishment, but instead to compel compliance. Trump can't use the pardon power again to interfere with ongoing contempt. 

If the strategy is to shield Flynn so he won't testify, Trump would need to depend on Flynn's loyalty and willingness to go to jail indefinitely to cover for him. Yet, Trump threw him overboard at the first sign of adversity and has been distancing himself ever since. Not very loyalty-inspiring. Once the pardon is given, unless Trump is willing to go full Putin and start ordering hits in the streets, he has no leverage over Flynn.

Also, even though the pardon would be given full effect, it bears noting that pardoning Flynn to obstruct Congressional and FBI investigations is likely impeachable in itself, regardless of what Flynn says or doesn't saysimply because he is a key subject or target of a broader ongoing investigation that implicates the Trump Regime. But if Flynn ultimately *does* testify and says something highly damaging, then Trump's improper motive for the pardon would be pretty conclusively established. 

And that's the ball game.               </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thoughtful piece that's worth a read:

**In a signature theme of its first 100 days, the Trump administration, encouraged by conservative media outlets, has launched an assault on civil servants the likes of which should have gone out of style in the McCarthy era.** Attacks on their credibility, motivations, future employment, and basic missions have become standard fare for White House press briefings and initiatives. In doing so, the administration and its backers may be crippling their legacy from the start by casting away the experts and implementers who not only make the executive agenda real but provide critical services for ordinary Americans. But in a move that should trouble all regardless of political affiliation, they also run the risk of undermining fundamental democratic principles of American governance.

...

**Pushing away civil servants who are perceived to disagree with the party in power also sets up the U.S. electoral system as winner-takes-all contest more closely resembling a third-world dictatorship than the United States (other Trump tendencies, such as placing immediate family members in senior posts, make this comparison all the more apt)**. While historically a new administration replaces senior policymakers with its own ideological allies, the bureaucracy itself has remained apolitical. This allows for each party  and specifically the party not in power at any given time  to feel at least somewhat assured that critical national security decisions will be informed by something other than pure politics, i.e., that the individuals in power will not take steps which first and foremost serve their continued reign and personal interests as opposed to the larger interests of the nation. **When this assumption is challenged, the stakes of a presidential election and electoral politics in general become astronomically higher, and can create the underlying conditions for violent conflict or even civil war. When political entities view victory as the only means of survival and see their rivals success as a guarantee of their own political demise, the gloves of civility come off in ways that could make the tactics of 2016 seem benign.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Elections don't have to be free and fair for Democrats to return to power. In fact, we know already that they *won't be*, given gerrymandering, voter suppression, etc. But if there's a regular pattern in American politics, it's the midterm backlash (and the 8-year aversion to continuing with the same party in power). At a certain point, unless there's outright election fraud/rigging--which there's been no significant evidence of so far--the backlash can overcome the tilted playing field. See the 2006 midterm. 

It's extraordinarily difficult to steal an election that isn't close. 

Policy choices have actual consequences in the medium to long term. The Trump Regime's ineptitude and ideologically-driven choices will adversely affect people's lives. Enough of those people will, in turn, react to the adverse effects by blaming the party in power and voting against them. Sure, we can expect more interference from Russia in 2018. But reality still exerts some influence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eh. I disagree with /u/DiplomaticDuncan on this.


Democracy is about more than just the formal rules. We also have  important norms and traditions--*i.e.*, the uncodified informal rules--that shape people's expectations and undergird the legitimacy of the system.  

If a relatively small partisan majority decided to nuke the legislative filibuster, and then used this momentary period of unforseen majoritarian dominance to opportunistically ram through radical structural changes to the federal judiciary (which they didn't campaign on, [but arguably can still implement](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/67r9mv/trump_says_he_may_break_up_appeals_court_that/dgsuld0/)) that wouldn't necessarily violate the Constitution. But it would eviscerate the norms of democratic behavior and shatter all precedent.

So *yes*, it would be undemocratic. And it would only deepen the current legitimacy crisis.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For federal courts, especially those inferior to the Supreme Court, you actually want [Title 28 of the U.S. Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28). 

Like all federal statutes, this can be changed by an ordinary act of Congress. 

There are all sorts of subtle and not so subtle ways to fuck with the these courts if Congress and the President were so inclined. For instance, they could place significant additional limits on the statutory provisions granting subject matter jurisdiction to federal courts--such as federal question jurisdiction ([28 U.S. Code  1331](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1331)), or you could restrict appellate jurisdiction ([28 U.S. Code  1291](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1291)).  Alternatively, they could mess with provisions related to the creation and composition of [district](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/132) and [circuit](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/43) courts, or authorizing and instituting procedures for [appellate panels](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/46). They could also define "regular active service" to mean something different than it currently does, effectively imposing term limits on judges so that Trump can get more appointments and reduce the influence of prior Presidents. 

Given the vagueness of Article III, the possibilities are limited mostly by tradition and norms of what would be considered improper. But keep in mind that radical changes would likely face significant push-back from civil society.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> This likely can't be done through reconciliation since the legislation has to pertain to the budget *and* be deficit neutral. 

But they could just invoke the nuclear option to [nuke the legislative filibuster itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/67r9mv/trump_says_he_may_break_up_appeals_court_that/dgso8nw/). 

Once they do this, they can pass anything they want with a 50%+1 majority. They don't have to invoke the nuclear option every time. So they wouldn't be wasting a silver bullet. They'd be using it on the very thing it would be used against anyway, and then proceeding under the new rule going forward. 

Of course, when Democrats get back in power, they'll be operating under the new precedents Republicans have created, and can simply reverse the GOP changes to the judiciary. They could also, for instance, increase the size of the Supreme Court (which isn't defined in the Constitution) as part of a broader reform to permit it to take more cases (*e.g.*, putting in place a panel / *en banc* system) and/or impose term limits for being active justices without stripping any justices of their lifetime tenure as members of the court (though this could potentially require a Constitutional Amendment).

The legislative filibuster is an anti-democratic institution in a Senate that is already wildly disproportional to begin with. Historically, it has been used far more often to obstruct progress than to preserve it. 

It sucks that this is potentially happening *precisely* under the Orange One, rather than a more reasonable Republican President. But even so, if Republicans abolish filibusters for momentary political gains, they will regret it sooner rather than later.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Under Senate rules, it takes 67 votes to change a Senate rule that's in force. 

But it only takes a bare majority to affirm a point of order that a particular Senate rule requiring a supermajority for something not specifically defined as such in the Constitution (such as treaty approval, constitutional amendments initiated by Congress, or veto overrides) is unconstitutional. The effect of this is to substitute the 50%+1 requirement in place of the former supermajority rule.

So the legislative filibuster could be nuked this way. As could the rule providing that rule changes require 2/3rds majorities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> (continued) [**2 of 2**] 

 [**Issue 2**] While some members of the supreme court were hypocritical and self - serving, at what point can a single state tie up the election? If, in 2020, Florida is red through Ann's through, and the dems win the presidency with Florida as the swing state, how long can Florida delay? Can they push back inauguration? How many legal challenges are permitted? At what point can, or should, the scotus say, "Enough is enough." ?

There are limits specified under federal statutes. And, whatever the limit is, it probably doesn't help that the SCOTUS wasted a significant amount of time available for the recount and made it impossible under the most artificial of the potential deadlines.

Justice Ginsbergs dissent is on point:

Even if there were an equal protection violation, I would agree with Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer that the Court's concern about the December 12 date, ante, at 110-111, is misplaced. **Time is short in part because of the Court's entry of a stay on December 9, several hours after an able circuit judge in Leon County had begun to superintend the recount process. More fundamentally, the Court's reluctance to let the recount go forwarddespite its suggestion that "[t]he search for intent can be confined by specific rules designed to ensure uniform treatment," ante, at 106ultimately turns on its own judgment about the practical realities of implementing a recount, not the judgment of those much closer to the process.**

**Equally important, as Justice Breyer explains, post, at 155 (dissenting opinion), the December 12 date for bringing Florida's electoral votes into 3 U. S. C.  5's safe harbor lacks the significance the Court assigns it. Were that date to pass, Florida would still be entitled to deliver electoral votes Congress must count unless both Houses find that the votes "ha[d] not been . .. regularly given." 3 U. S. C.  15.** The statute identifies other significant dates. See, e. g.,  7 (specifying December 18 as the date electors "shall meet and give their votes");  12 (specifying "the fourth Wednesday in December"this year, December 27as the date on which Congress, **if it has not received a State's electoral votes, shall request the state secretary of state to send a certified return immediately**). **But none of these dates has ultimate significance in light of Congress' detailed provisions for determining, on "the sixth day of January," the validity of electoral votes.  15.**

Besides the SCOTUS complicity in creating the time crunch by entering the stay in the first place, [3 U.S.C.  12s](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/12) reference to what Congress *could* do in the event it *still* had not received the electoral votes by December 27 makes no sense if a states certified electoral votes needed to be received by that date. You could make a decently strong argument that December 18 was a real cutoff, because that was the date Congress specified for the electors to meet and cast their votes. *See* [3 U.S.C.  7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/7); *and* [3 U.S.C.  6](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/6). Arguably that requirement could be binding even if the votes weren't received by December 27.

Ultimately, though, all dates prior to January 6 were basically procedural milestones to facilitate a predictable, orderly process. The Florida recount was an extraordinary situation. Any date before January 6 could theoretically work. A case in point is the 1960 election, when Hawaii didnt even begin its recount until December 13, and  ultimately it only certified the result on January 4. There were two sets of electors appointed. But the electoral votes for the certified winner, JFK, were counted. It comes down to whether you want to make it work or not. January 6, unlike the other dates, was *unquestionably* a hard deadline. Thats when the electoral votes were to be counted and the winner was to be formally recognized. *See* [3 U.S.C.  15](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15)

[This law review article](http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1250 context=fss_papers) gives a great rundown of the flaws with the various legal arguments in the *Bush v. Gore* majority opinionranging from the SCOTUS interpretation of Florida election law (and disregard for federalism), to the convolution of the equal protection argument. Im not going to debate those issues in order to avoid taking this discussion even further off topic. 

With that said, the articles discussion of the SCOTUS decision to style the December 12 safe harbor as some sort of un-breachable cutoff is highly relevant here, because it drives home the pretextual nature of that argument:

-----------

[3 U.S.C.] Section 5 thus creates a safe harbor for states to ensure that their electoral votes are counted by Congress. **Note that going past the safe harbor does not mean that the electoral votes will not be counted.** The safe harbor simply makes the vote count conclusive. There are many examples of electoral votes being finalized after the safe harbor period, so missing the safe harbor deadline would hardly be an unmitigated disaster. In the 1960 election, for example, Hawaiis votes were not finalized until January 4.  **In the 2000 election, twenty-one states did not submit their electors to the National Archives by the December 12 deadline. These included three statesIowa, New Mexico, and Wisconsinin which the presidential election was particularly close. Four statesCalifornia, Iowa, Maryland, and Pennsylvaniadid not sign the Certificates of Ascertainment establishing the identity of their electors until December 14.** As officials at the National Archives patiently explained to reporters following the expiration of the December 12 deadline, **the reason for the seemingly slow pace of filings with the National Archives is that the real deadline is Dec. 18, when the members of the electoral college meet in their respective states** (and in the District of Columbia) to vote for the president and vice president. 

Nevertheless, Rehnquist asserted, the Florida legislature intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by federal law, and the Florida Supreme Court violated Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, because its interpretations of Florida law took Floridas election out of the federal safe harbor. Rehnquist thought the safe harbor was no longer available because the Florida Supreme Court had substantially changed Florida law as it existed on November 7, for the reasons discussed previously. Even if the Florida Supreme Court had not changed the law but only interpreted and clarified it, however, Rehnquist believed that the court-ordered recounts would take Florida out of the federal safe harbor because they might extend past December 12. 

**There are four problems with this** objection. First, the text of the Florida Election Code is completely silent about the safe harbor deadline. The only Florida lawmaking body that had said anything about the safe harbor was the Florida Supreme Court, which Rehnquist had just accused of reading things into the text that were not there. Second, December 12 is not the real deadline; December 18 is. **Ensuring that Floridas vote is conclusive is surely a valid purpose, but it is not the only purpose behind the election code.** Given changed circumstances, one has to decide **which purpose is more importantmeeting the safe harbor deadline or counting every legal vote and attempting to discern which candidate actually received the most votes.** Choosing between valid but competing purposes is a fairly standard job of courts in interpreting statutes. The **text of the Florida Election Code does not decide this question,** and Rehnquist and the Florida Supreme Court simply disagreed about which was more important. But that disagreement does not by itself constitute a violation of Article II, Section 1. Third, **at the very moment that Rehnquist wrote his opinion, the Florida legislature was planning to endorse a Republican slate of electors that would directly violate the safe harbor requirement** because the endorsement was a change in Florida electoral law that would occur after the November 7 election. This is essentially the same cast of characters that created the 1999 Florida Election Code, and thus offers fairly strong evidence that the 1999 Florida legislature was willing to forsake the safe harbor if something more important was at stake. Fourth, **the major impediment to completing the recounts by December 12 was the U.S. Supreme Courts stay of the recounts on December 9. The recounts were well on their way to completion when the Court stopped them. It then issued its opinion (along with Rehnquists complaint about tardiness) at ten P.M. on December 12.** It hardly seems fair to blame the Florida Supreme Court for going past the safe harbor deadline when the U.S. Supreme Court held it up until the deadline was almost past.

<TEXT> **[1 of 2]**

 [**Issue 1**] As I understand it, the Florida court issued a narrow scope to recount the ballots, as a result of Gore's team's behest. Whether or not the recount could have included the overvotes at that point is beyond me, but I believe no, or at least not without more legal wrangling.


That's not 100% correct. 


It's true that Gore requested a hand recount of undervotes in 4 counties: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Volusia Counties. This was arguably a legal and PR misstep, since it didn't quite fit with "count every vote" message and thus played into the Bush legal and PR teams' arguments that Gore was a "[Soreloserman](http://www.donspage.com/funny/pictures/soreloserman.html)" who wanted to cherrypick votes after the fact. Yet, despite Gore's narrow request, the Florida Supreme Court ordered a statewide hand recount, which is what SCOTUS halted in [*Bush v. Gore*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2298973060085224552 q=bush+v+gore hl=en as_sdt=2006). 

The FL Supreme Court ruling specified that ballots where there was no vote for President recorded by machine (undervotes) were to be counted. Yet, Florida had a broad intent of the voter standard at the time. As noted previously, the statewide hand recount had been under the supervision of Florida Judge Terry Lewiswho was enforcing uniform standards for the process and coordinating with the various county election canvassing boards. Initially, this process was concerned with undervotes (the famous "hanging" and "pregnant" chads). But as also noted, Judge Lewis told the canvassing boards that overvotes (not just undervotes) were to be segregated for potential counting and that those ballots where the clear intent of the voters could be discerned were to be tallied so that he could rule on the issue for all counties. 

It's probably impossible to objectively discern intent from an overvote ballot that has marks by more than one Presidential candidate's lines--even if one mark is visibly stronger than the other, or is partial (a possible exception would be where one bubble were erased but registered by machine as an overvote due to smudging).  

The specific overvotes I was talking about aren't nearly so ambiguous. Apparently, in counties across the state, there were ballots where voters both marked a single choice for President and *wrote in the same candidate's name in the space provided*. Clearly, these voters misunderstood the effect of doing this (nullifying their ballot). But they just as clearly intended to vote for the candidate who they were eager (or careful) to both mark and write in. 


Heres the relevant excerpt from [one of the articles I previously linked](http://rinr.fsu.edu/winter2005/features/battlefield.html):

RinR: One of the most interesting points you make in the book is that the focus on undervotes (ballots containing no vote for president)the hanging, dimpled and otherwise pregnant chadswas misplaced. Instead, you explain that a study by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, which looked at all the ballots that were initially rejected on election night 2000, revealed a surprise: most of these uncounted votes were in fact discarded because they were over-votes, instances of two votes for president on one ballot. What do you think the NORC study tells us about the election?

LdHS: Its an embarrassing outcome for George Bush because it showed that Gore had gotten more votes. Everybody had thought that the chads were where all the bad ballots were, but it turned out that the ones that were the most decisive were write-in ballots where people would check Gore and write Gore in, and the machine kicked those out. There were 175,000 votes overall that were so-called spoiled ballots. **About two-thirds of the spoiled ballots were over-votes**; ***many or most of them would have been write-in over-votes, where people had punched and written in a candidates name.*** And nobody looked at this, not even the Florida Supreme Court in the last decision it made requiring a statewide recount. **Nobody had thought about it except Judge Terry Lewis, who was overseeing the statewide recount when it was halted by the U.S. Supreme Court.** The write-in over-votes have really not gotten much attention. Those votes are not ambiguous. When you see Gore picked and then Gore written in, theres not a question in your mind who this person was voting for. When you go through those, theyre unambiguous: Bush got some of those votes, but they were overwhelmingly for Gore. For example, in an analysis of the 2.7 million votes that had been cast in Floridas eight largest counties, **The Washington Post found that Gores name was punched on 46,000 of the over-vote ballots it, while Bushs name was marked on only 17,000.**

RinR: For your research, you merged this set of data with detailed profiles of Floridas electoral precincts. What did you find?

LdHS: One of the things I found that hadnt been reported anywhere is, **if you look at where those votes occurred, they were in predominantly black precincts.** And (when you look at) the history of black voting in Florida, these are people that have been disenfranchised, intimidated. In the history of the early 20th century, **black votes would be thrown out on technicalities, like they would use an X instead of a check mark.**

**So you can understand why African Americans would be so careful, checking off Gores name on the list of candidates and also writing Gores name in the space for write-in votes. But because of the way the vote-counting machines work, this had the opposite effect: the machines threw out their ballots.**

It seems very plausible that Judge Lewis, charged with ensuring uniformity, would have issued a ruling that overvote ballots with both a mark and the name of the same candidate--which he'd *specifically instructed* to be tallied for all counties--would have been included in the total. Such a ruling would be on very strong ground under an "intent of the voter standard."

<TEXT>  It's a common masturbatory focus of Fox News. My dad parroted the same shit to me about how nobody respected the US under Obama but they do now. Fucking lol, who respects us more now? 

It's shocking how out of touch this is. Nothing could be further from the truth, really.

It's actually Trump who is tarnishing our international reputation a bit more with each passing day. (Enough to inspire images like [Der Spiegel's recent cover](https://mobile.twitter.com/DerSPIEGEL/status/827562802571251712/photo/1) (Germany) or [this cover](http://m.imgur.com/KThk2cl) for the UK-based Economist).

Here are notable findings from Pew Research Center 2016 Global Attitudes Survey (I look forward to the 2017 edition, which will likely be even worse):

[Confidence in Obama](http://imgur.com/47aptn2)

[No confidence in Trump]
(http://imgur.com/lRMVuAf)

[Comparative confidence in various world leaders](http://imgur.com/QPxo8WK)

(Trump actually does *worse than Putin*, whereas Obama is the most, and most widely, respected of the leaders for which there was polling data.)

And these are older numbers. It's likely only gotten worse with the Muslim Ban, which received negative press coverage everywhere, saber rattling on North Korea, and disrespectful interactions with non-authoritarian world leaders (*e.g.*, failing to shake Merkel's hand but congratulating Erdowan and implicitly endorsing Le Pen). For instance, there's been a [dramatic drop in German confidence in US]
(https://twitter.com/MKarnitschnig/status/827267801924526080) since the election  in Feb. '17, only 22% of Germans see the  U.S. as a trustworthy partner, down from 59% in Nov. '16 (-37%). And that was before Merkel's visit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The idea is that people who live in different places have different wants and needs and should have their interests represented.

Right, and a direct popular vote would do just that. Everyone would have an *equal* and *proportional* say, regardless of where they happen to live, how close their neighbor lives, or whether they prefer the same party as most of the people of their state do. 

People in rural states wouldn't be ignored--far from it.

Since every vote would matter, Presidential candidates would have to campaign everywhere to assemble a winning coalition. Since many rural states aren't competitive now, interests of people in those states might even get *more* attention. And likewise, interests shared by rural populations in different states would also get attention, even if those populations wouldn't be large enough within their respective states to make those states competitive.

<TEXT> I remember those races. Hopefully, with the backlash brewing in 2018, it will be different. 

[In an interview, Sen. Corker declined to say whether he's running for re-election](http://www.wbir.com/mb/news/politics/sen-bob-corker-not-yet-ready-to-say-whether-he-will-run-for-third-term/432097887?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTVRreVptVTVZell6WXpGayIsInQiOiI0RjUybm1QSkhYOWFZOFppT1N2amp4THIxcDNtM3Rva3h1ZGVOSzFWK3NBYWM1Q1BnTjV5OG9oOGRTcFZqM1dydER3YXdsRUp1OVJwM0VLMDg3d3V1SjJlMUEwM2dhQkJobm5IQTM1TDI4MnREUytIdUZXcGtKM01pUHg2SjZoZiJ9).  

Hopefully, he decides against it. That could potentially open up another path to a Democratic Senate majority (currently, the only remotely plausible one looks like holding every competitive seat and flipping NV, AZ, and TX).

But also to your point, whether one's vote matters shouldn't depend on where we live. A popular vote would let both* the votes of Tennessee Democrats and California Republicans matter and have an equal effect on the outcome. When someone says only big states would matter under PV, it's completely wrong. Individual votes would matter. So it would make sense to appeal for them wherever you could.  The result would be a truly national campaign with maximum incentives to turn out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words. The fact I've managed to persuade you through rational argument is honestly the best complement you can ever give. 

Do check out the links when you get the chance, because there's a lot of additional evidence and nuance there. 

As for your question

I don't buy some of what Mensch is pushing, particularly the analysis (she sees Comey as some sort of tragically misunderstood hero), but I nevertheless find the timing of the laptop email revelations really suspicious. 

In my post immediately above, I linked to [this Chicago Tribune article](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-emails-investigation-20161102-story.html) reporting that the laptop emails were discovered more than two weeks before Comey was briefed. 

During those weeks, no effort appears to have been made to seek a warrant or review them. We know that it took 9 days to complete the full review, based on the time elapsed between the initial Comey letter and the second letter notifying Congress that the investigation's conclusions had not changed (including delays to obtain the warrant so the review could begin). So theoretically there could have been enough time to review the laptop emails in between the time they were discovered and when Comey notified Congress, on October 28. 

In his letter, Comey claimed to only have been briefed the day before, October 27:

In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. **I am writing to inform you that the investigative team** ***briefed me on this yesterday***, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.

When Comey received the briefing, one of the first questions out of his mouth should have been "when and where did you find these emails?" Upon discovering that no action had been taken during the preceding 3 weeks, he should have demanded a convincing explanation given the obvious potential to increase the effectiveness of an October surprise (which should not be the objective of an investigation). Likewise, he should have conducted at least a preliminary review to get a sense of how many emails there were and to exclude duplicates of emails that had already been reviewed. Having worked on various large document reviews myself, I can tell you that there's off the shelf e-discovery software that can do this. The letter and the way in which this was handled, [in violation of standing DoJ policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html?_r=1 utm_source=huffingtonpost.com utm_medium=referral utm_campaign=pubexchange_article mtrref=undefined), shows a worrying lack of adequate precautions to minimize the political fallout.

If Comey was lied to about when the emails were discovered (which would have been apparent before the election in light of the reporting), the people who lied should have been publicly fired and censured so that voters could take the attempt to manipulate the election outcome into consideration when voting.

Likewise, if Comey knew about the emails before October 27, then he may have mislead or outright lied to Congress in his letter. 

All of this is made worse by the contrast in how the Russian hacking and potential Trump collusion were handled.

Comey specifically refused to sign the FBI onto the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) [statement on October 7, 2016 that publicly attributed the attacks to Russia](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement)even though he agreed that Russia was behind the hacks and [had wanted to write an Op-Ed to that effect](http://www.newsweek.com/fbi-director-james-comey-russian-tampering-election-576417)supposedly because the October 7 statement was being issued too close to the election. But recall that 3 weeks later, to the day, from the initial release of the October 7 statement on Russian interference (which didn't explicitly say the interference was to help Trump), on October 28, Comey sent the letter that damaged the Clinton Campaign. Apparently 11 days wasn't too close to the election, but 31 days was.  (Whatever Comey's motives, his decision to do this against others insistent advice embodies the "I know best" attitude that I find absolutely infuriating.) 

The DHS/ODNI statement even [came up at the third debate on October 19](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-blames-russia-putin-wikileaks-rele/) and Trump questioned it in front of millions of people. 


Despite now vowing to do [everything in his power "identify, investigate and then call out foreign efforts" to influence an election](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TRUMP_RUSSIA_COMEY?SITE=AP SECTION=HOME TEMPLATE=DEFAULT CTIME=2017-04-13-12-52-45), Comey couldn't even be bothered to say a quick "actually, the FBI agrees with the October 7 statement" to refute the disinformation and innuendo Trump was spreading by mischaracterizing the FBI's non-endorsement of the statement as an indication that it was unreliable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, that's not accurate and the [NYT was criticized for its reporting of this issue](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/kausfiles_special/2001/11/everything_the_new_york_times_thinks_about_the_florida_recount_is_wrong.html). 

The recount stopped by the SCOTUS in *Bush v. Gore* was a statewide recount ordered *sua sponte* by the Florida Supreme Court under the supervision of Judge Terry Lewiswho was enforcing uniform standards for the process. 

In contemporaneous communications with Florida county canvassing boards, Judge Lewis instructed (*see linked article above*) that *overvotes*not just *undervotes*were to be segregated for potential counting and that those ballots where the clear intent of the voters could be discerned were to be tallied so that he could rule on the issue for all counties. This was not the standard applied by the NYT.

This is notable because there were a substantial number of votes statewide [where Gore's name was both punched in *and* written in](http://rinr.fsu.edu/winter2005/features/battlefield.html), causing a ballot to be "spoiled" (*i.e.*, registered as an overvote) and not counted by machine even though the voters intent was unambiguous. An analysis of the overvotes found about a 2.7:1 ratio of votes where Gores name was punched vs. those where Bush name was punched. Overvote ballots where the punch and write-ins matched would likely have been counted by Judge Lewis if the SCOTUS had permitted the statewide recount to proceed.  Moreover, there was ample time to complete such a recount. Given the extraordinary circumstances and compelling interest in getting the election result right, the purported deadlines could easily have been extended at least until December 27, 2000, when electoral votes were ordinarily to be certified, or possibly even to January 6, 2001, when the electoral votes were to be counted before a joint session of Congress.

The *Bush v. Gore* decision itself is widely deridedby *both* liberal and conservative legal scholarsfor its inconsistent equal protection analysis and disrespect for federalism (which the majority favored until it wasnt convenient). Evidently, even the majority knew the flimsiness of its reasoningchoosing to issue an unsigned *per curiam* opinion and expressly limiting its applicability as precedent to the specific facts of the case. 

Beyond the legal dispute, there were various acts of deliberate administrative sabotage and extra-judicial power-plays that biased the outcome against Gore, including the dilatory tactics used to stall the recount process (such as the infamous [Brooks Brothers rent-a-riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Brothers_riot), in which Roger Stoneyes *that* Roger Stonewas heavily involved, and Katherine Harris' orders halting the recount) as well as the [wrongful, intentionally over-inclusive purging of eligible voters from the rolls before the election](http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/vote2000/report/exesum.htm) (orchestrated by Katherine Harris and Jeb Bush). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fine, not all problems. But I think the broader point is that the EC affirmatively overrode the correct judgment of the electorate at large, and in both instances led to a worse decision. 

Whatever else one can say about the ECand there's plenty to be saidit fails more often than the popular vote at selecting good leaders. It even fails to prevent demagogues from taking power, which was one of its original purposes per Federalist 68. 

These failures are actually not surprising at all, since the EC narrows the scope of electoral competition from (1) who can win the most votes in the country as a whole to (2) who can win bare pluralities in a few swing states while locking down safe noncompetitive states simply by having a (D) or (R) next to your name on the ballot. This discards information about the *intensity* of voter preferences (*e.g.*, all of the GOP votes in Blue states and Democratic votes in Red states, as well as the excess victory margin in the states won by each candidate). This is precisely the sort of information that's can lead to a better decision. What's more, the EC makes the vast majority of states safe to ignore. So it reshapes candidates' policies away from serving most of the people in the country to appealing to closely divided states (which aren't necessarily representative), even when it doesn't change the ultimate winner. 

It's a bad anachronistic system that we need to abolish, directly through a constitutional amendment, or indirectly and more immediately, through [the national popular vote interstate compact](http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> **[TL:DR]**

Trump: 42 Approve / 52 Disapprove

Worse job (Trump / Obama): 49 Trump / 39 Obama

Border Wall: 59 Oppose / 35 Support

Find Trump's Twitter use inappropriate: 73%

-----

According to the results of the latest Elon University Poll, **49 percent say Trump is doing a worse job as president than President Obama, while only 39 percent say Trump is outperforming his predecessor.**

The Elon Poll found that nearly three-fourths of voters think that Trumps use of the social media platform Twitter is inappropriate, and 55 percent disagree with his claim that the media is the enemy of the American people.The live-caller, dual frame (landline and cell phone) survey of 506 likely voters was conducted from April 18-21. Survey results in this news release present responses from registered voters who were classified as likely voters in the Nov. 8 election and has a margin of error of +/- 4.36 percentage points.

Since Trump was elected president in November, his support has declined among N.C. voters, according to poll results. While **Trump was elected with 49.9 percent of the vote in North Carolina, only 41.6 percent of voters currently approve of the job he is doing as president with 50.5 percent disapproving.** That approval number tracks closely with recent national polls, which found a 42 percent approval rating for the president.

...

Among N.C. voters, **59 percent oppose building the wall**, and support for the project is clearly split among party lines. Taking party affiliation into account, 76 percent of Republicans are in favor of pushing ahead with building the wall with 92 percent of Democrats opposing it. Among independent voters, nearly two-thirds oppose the project. Opposition to a border wall is especially strong among Millennial voters, with 65 percent against the wall. Women voters oppose the wall by at 62-32 margin, with men against the wall by a 56-39 margin. Eighty-six percent of black voters oppose the wall compared with 51 percent of white voters who are against it.

It'd be one thing if they were diligently pursuing the investigation but it were taking a while. What appears to be happening here is stonewalling by denying resources. The investigation is severely understaffed. For example, the House Select Committee on Benghazi had 46 staffers to investigate something that had been investigated 7 times before. The House and Senate Select Committees on Iran-Contra had 181 staffers. 

Trump-Russia, as of this week, had just 7 in the Senate. None were full time. And before this hire, none were legally-trained or had any investigative background.

Respectfully, fuck patience. 

If Republicans won't investigate seriously, then Democrats need to make their failure to do so into a midterm issue.  </TEXT>

Source close to April Doss tells me she was brought on by the Dems and will work full time on Trump-Russia probe 

-----

The former head of intelligence law at the National Security Agency (NSA), April Doss, has been hired to work on the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, her law firm confirmed in a press release on Wednesday.

Doss, who spent over a decade at the NSA and now chairs the Cybersecurity and Privacy practice at Saul Ewing, LLP, will serve as the committee's special counsel as it examines "allegations that Russia participated in a disinformation campaign intended to benefit President Donald Trump, and claims of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia," the firm said.

Doss will join the committee on May 1.

...

A Senate source confirmed to Business Insider that Doss has been hired to work on the investigation but will not be "leading the probe."

Doss' hire comes amid reports that the SSCI's Russia investigation has stalled amid partisan bickering and staffing problems. Yahoo's Michael Isikoff reported earlier this week that, more than three months into the committee's investigation, however, it has descended into a "standoff."

The committee hasn't issued any subpoenas or requested any key documents such as emails, memos, and phone records from the Trump campaign, in part because its chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, "has so far failed to respond to requests from the panel's Democrats to sign letters doing so," Isikoff reported.

The committee's Russia investigation is also severely understaffed, the Daily Beast and Reuters reported. The seven staffers who are working on it are doing so part-time, and none has relevant legal or investigative experience.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So even though I think the proposed border wall is a counterproductive and wasteful boodogle designed mainly to serve as a comfort blanky for nativists, this is a problematic law. 

It's essentially a state-level bill of attainder directed at federal contractors. Since the contactors would be implementing federal policy, if state law interfered with that policy, there'd be a fairly clear supremacy clause/preemption issue.

I also see potential issues with equal protection and due process, as well as under dormant commerce clause doctrine (depending on how the blacklist were applied). 

I think categorical prohibitions on doing business would be the most likely to be struck down as unconstitutional or preempted. Factors and guidelines directing how CalPERS funds should be invested might fare better.     </TEXT>

-----

Comeys October 28 and November 6 letters are worthy of their own discussion. 

My main objection is that Comey sent the extremely vague initial letter:

(1) without conducting a preliminary review of the laptop emails and excluding duplicates [even though the FBI knew about it for 3 weeks beforehand](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-emails-investigation-20161102-story.html);

(2) knowing full-well that it would leak, and having explicitly acknowledged (*in his words*) the "[significant risk of being misunderstood" if it did;

(3) against the advice of subordinates and superiors, and in violation of long-established DoJ and general investigatory protocol;

(4) while applying a completely different standard to public disclosure of the FBI's still ongoing investigation of Clinton's opponent (see below);

and

(5) just 10 days before the electionwhile millions of people were already votinghaving apparently calculated, in part, that Clinton was far enough ahead that it wouldn't matter (which would be totally inappropriate even if Comey were correct because of the letters potential impacts on the victory margin as well as downballot races).

In his unshakable [self-righteousness](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/opinion/campaign-stops/james-comeys-self-righteous-meddling.html?smid=tw-nytopinion smtyp=cur), Comey was convinced that his own moral compass and judgment was correct and that everyone else was wrong. 

This [deep-dive NYT piece on Comey from last Sunday](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/us/politics/james-comey-election.html?_r=0 referer=https://t.co/gU4pdevSXc) filled in some of the final missing pieces for me, and cast Comey in an even worse light than Id previously seen him:


**Should you consider what youre about to do may help elect Donald Trump president?** an adviser asked him, Mr. Comey recalled recently at a closed meeting with F.B.I. agents.

**He could not let politics affect his decision, he replied. If we ever start considering who might be affected, and in what way, by what we do, were done,** he told the agents.

**But with polls showing Mrs. Clinton holding a comfortable lead, Mr. Comey ended up plunging the F.B.I. into the molten center of a bitter election**. Fearing the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I. had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret, Mr. Comey sent a letter informing Congress that the case was reopened.

**What he did not say was that the F.B.I. was also investigating the campaign of Donald J. Trump. Just weeks before, Mr. Comey had declined to answer a question from Congress about whether there was such an investigation**. Only in March, long after the election, did Mr. Comey confirm that there was one.

For Mr. Comey, keeping the F.B.I. out of politics is such a preoccupation that he once said he would never play basketball with President Barack Obama because of the appearance of being chummy with the man who appointed him. But in the final months of the presidential campaign, the leader of the nations pre-eminent law enforcement agency shaped the contours, if not the outcome [*note: it totally altered the outcome*](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2), of the presidential race by his handling of the Clinton and Trump-related investigations.

...

**An examination by The New York Times, based on interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement, congressional and other government officials, found that while partisanship was not a factor in Mr. Comeys approach to the two investigations, he handled them in starkly different ways**. ***In the case of Mrs. Clinton, he rewrote the script, partly based on the F.B.I.s expectation that she would win and fearing the bureau would be accused of helping her. In the case of Mr. Trump, he conducted the investigation by the book, with the F.B.I.s traditional secrecy.*** Many of the officials discussed the investigations on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.

**Mr. Comey made those decisions with the supreme self-confidence of a former prosecutor** who, in a distinguished career, has cultivated a reputation for what supporters see as fierce independence, and detractors view as **media-savvy arrogance**.

Whatever you think of Clinton, this double standard is inexcusable. Counter-intelligence investigations also inherently entail criminal investigations, so I dont think thats a valid distinction for why Trump was treated differently. Besides, Comey actually would have been doing the the right thing by not disclosing the FBIs counterintelligence and criminal investigations of Trump*provided he had afforded Clinton the same by-the-book treatment*. Having disclosed Clintons investigation, which he shouldnt have done to begin with, Comey now arguably had an obligation to make further disclosures in order to ensure that what he had said about Clinton would not be misleading. Instead, Comey allowed Trump to perpetuate a narrative that Comey knew was false and had himself enabled with his incomplete disclosures.  This is the peril of intervention. 

Indeed, Comey failed to attribute the DNC and Podesta email hacks to the Kremlin even as Trump publicly cited the FBIs silence on the October 7 statement to call its assessments into doubt. Here's a key excerpt from the same NYT piece, underscoring that Comey also erred on the Russia interference

Mr. Comey and other senior administration officials met twice in the White House Situation Room in early October to again discuss a public statement about Russian meddling. But the roles were reversed: Susan Rice, the national security adviser, wanted to move ahead. **Mr. Comey was less interested in being involved.**

At their second meeting, ***Mr. Comey argued that it would look too political for the F.B.I. to comment so close to the election, according to several people in attendance. Officials in the room felt whiplashed. Two months earlier, Mr. Comey had been willing to put his name on a newspaper article; now he was refusing to sign on to an official assessment of the intelligence community.***

Mr. Comey said that in the intervening time, Russian meddling had become the subject of news stories and a topic of national discussion. He felt it was no longer necessary for him to speak publicly about it. **So when Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, and James R. Clapper Jr., the national intelligence director, accused Russias senior-most officials on Oct. 7 of a cyber operation to disrupt the election, the F.B.I. was conspicuously silent.**

***That night, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of hacked emails from another source: the private email account of John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign.***
This is incoherence at best, and pure hypocrisy or an improper ulterior motive, at worst. Comey could just have said, "actually, we agree with this assesment." Yet he stood by and did nothing. This is the precise reason its why Comeys refusal to defer to others is so dangerous. Were at the mercy of his whims, and that undermines the rule of law.

---------------

Finally, [as Ive argued at length](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2), the letters effect was decisive. To me, its actually harder to see how the letter didnt matter than how it did, when a swing of just 39K votes allocated among three states would have changed the outcome.  [I'm not the only one](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/04/lets-talk-about-bubbles-and-james-comey) with [this assessment](http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/1/11/14215930/comey-email-election-clinton-campaign). [Not by a longshot](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/855798547505180673).

This is the most explicitly political of the criticisms Ive offered of Comeybut when the subject is a democratic election, political implications are no less important to consider than faulty investigatory procedures. Comey *should* have thought about the unpredictable ways his intervention could influence the election and if possible, chosen the option that had the least political impact.  Comey was not supposed to be the main attraction. Clinton and Trump were. Yet, the vague and improper letter on October 28, in particular, [sucked up all the bandwidth for substantive issue discussions](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/856534317987749889). The damage from this crowding out for what ultimately turned out to be a nothingburger can't be underestimated. In addition to tipping the Presidential election, it sabotaged the campaign's closing argument for downballot Democrats.

In late October, with Clinton up 6-7 points, her campaign and [President Obama began to pivot to an attack against the dysfunctional Republican Congress](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/25/politics/obama-unleashed/) in order to build on the [momentum from Clinton's three dominant debate performances](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-probably-finished-off-trump-last-night/) and tie Congressional Republicans to the cratering Trumpwho they refused to disavow. The whole election had been gradually building to this decisive moment. Then, right in the middle of it, Comeys letter hit and yanked the football away, changing the narrative and reenergizing the flailing Trump campaign. The rest of the campaign became defense against Trump's exaggerated characterizations and outright fabrications of what the new emails contained. Democrats dropped across the board in the Senate polls and [generic Congressional ballot]( https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/senate/generic-ballot/). This was recognized at the time.

Thanks. It always makes my day when people find my blatherings worthwhile and informative.

I've probably spilled more digital ink on Comey than any other single subjectother than *perhaps* the advantages of a nationally-aggregated popular vote over the Electoral College, or my attempts to reassure people that midterms chances and downballot Democratic losses during Obama are best understood in terms of fundamental political dynamics (*e.g.*, who holds the Presidency, for how long, how popular they are) revealed by the remarkably-regular patterns we see when looking back at prior elections. 

Comey's actions bother the shit out of me for reasons I will lay out in two posts (originally meant as one but it exceeded the character limit). 

------------------

Foremost, as a lawyer, investigative procedure and ethics happens to be something I know a bit about. I don't generally advertise that fact except when asked directly, because I want the arguments to speak for themselves rather than rely on who I say I am or any purported expertise I may have. It also forces me to explain key foundational stuff to a lay audiencelike the difference between an investigator and a prosecutorrather than taking for granted that it's understood. 

What Comey did strikes me as unprecedented and highly improper. I argued against his intervention in [this detailed post from a week before the election](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/the_fbi_is_trumpland_anticlinton_atmosphere/d9kctvb), which I think holds up pretty well today not only in its identification of the problem, but also its predictions. 

Essentially, Comey initially erred by editorializing at the July 5 press conference and only compounded the error with other decisions he made. Let me be clear that I don't think Comey is a garden variety partisan hack who pulls for one team or the other. Rather, he looks out for himself and what he perceives the FBI's interests to be. Over time, he has carefully cultivated a reputation for being impartial and he guards that reputation zealouslyperhaps too zealously, to the extent he forgets that his reputation isnt an end in itself. I think his press conference was an attempt to show his work and try to establish that he had reached his decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution based on the merits of the evidence he considered, without outside political pressure.

This strategy backfired spectacularly. 

Not only was Comeys decision criticized anyway, but he provided powerful ammunition to Clintons opponents when he criticized Clinton for what he characterized as extreme carelessness. Rather than reassuring Republicans that he was not carrying water for the administration and Clinton, the fact that he was so willing to commentwhen investigators *almost never* do in these situationscreated the appearance that there *had indeed* been interference, either because people independently reached different conclusions than Comey (which doesn't mean that Comey's conclusions were an unreasonable abuse of discretion), or because they inferred that Comey might be signaling that Clinton *had* committed crimes but his hands were tied. 

Compounding matters, people who arent legally-trained often dont understand that a criminal offense consists of [**both**]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrence) an *actus reus* (a voluntary wrongful action) **and** a requisite degree of *mens rea* (culpable intent). Even criminal statutes that don't explicitly mention intent are construed to contain a *mens rea* requirement. [*See*, *e.g.*, *Morissette v. United States*]( https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=787130527265701764 q=342+U.S.+246,+251 hl=en as_sdt=2006), 342 U.S. 246 (1952) (Crime, as a compound concept, generally constituted only from concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand  As the states codified the common law of crimes, even if their enactments were silent on the subject, their courts assumed that the omission did not signify disapproval of the principle but merely recognized that intent was so inherent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory affirmation.)

This is an essential protection of substantive criminal law, and is encapsulated by the Latin maxim:

*Actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea*

Which translates to:

 An act does not make a person guilty, unless the mind is guilty.

**Many people understood that Clinton had committed a crime but got off on some technicality, when in fact the absence of *mens rea* negates the crime.** In other words, Clinton didn't unintentionally "commit a crime"which requires a criminal conviction upon proof, to a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, of all the elements of the offense, *including* culpable intent. People yelling "lock her up!" or calling for Clinton to be disqualified from the election based on purported criminality were basically calling for punishment without a criminal indictmentlet alone a trial. 

The Trump campaign did everything to encourage this misunderstanding of criminal law and procedure. And the strategy was highly effective politically. Recall that the aftermath of the Comey press conference was [the first time Clintons poll numbers sank sharply](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/#now), and that they didnt fully recover until *after* the Democratic National Convention. At one point, Trump took the only lead of the campaign in the 538 forecast, which is further indirect evidence of how much Comeys letters (and the media's sensationalist coverage of them) likely mattered.  


-----------------

Just as importantly, the press conference presented all this derogatory information about Clinton outside the context of adversarial legal proceeding where it could be challenged and various defenses could be presented. Now, this is the sort of procedural issue that might concern a lawyer a lot more than a non-lawyer. But think about what you'd want to happen if you were in the shoes of the person being investigated. Would you want the FBI using its coercive investigatory powers to obtain evidence, ultimately finding that the evidence wasn't enough to warrant a criminal referral, yet still publicly criticizing your alleged actions that, *by their own admission*, could not support a criminal indictment? 

This is essentially what Comey did. And it was wrong.


In his capacity as FBI director, Comey is not a prosecutor. Hes more like a senior police detective*an investigator*. Investigators almost always dont disclose derogatory information about the subjects of their investigationsthat is, unless and until theres a public indictment *by a prosecutor* that relies on the information. Comey had every right to give his most brutal assessment to the prosecutor with jurisdiction and discretion of whether to pursue charges against Clinton. But its not Comey's place to publicly scold anyone for admittedly non-criminal conduct. These rules and norms exist to ensure due process and curb the immense potential for [abuse](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-09-08/entertainment/9103070622_1_hoover-legendary-fbi-director-secret-files) through extrajudicial disclosure of investigatory or surveillance information.  

Riley Robert's excellent profile of Comey, from September of last year, is worth reading in full because its turned out to be prescient of the pitfalls of Comeys obdurate[e] self-assur[ance]:

[The Case Against James Comey](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/james-comey-fbi-accountability-214234)

Having fueled a firestorm of innuendo with his extraordinary press conference, Comey was then hauled before Congress multiple times to give testimony, where he further discussed investigative information that would normally not be disclosed absent an indictment. And when the laptop emails came to light months afterward, he felt compelled to supplement his initial testimony (at his discretion, because it was not required and against DoJ guidelines, in any event).

<TEXT> For the second time in two major legislative battles, the Trump White House has issued an ultimatum  only to back down.

In the health care debate, the president was going to force a House vote on the package and dare skeptical Republicans to vote against replacing Obamacare, before abandoning that plan in the face of defeat.

And now, in the government funding debate, he's backing off his previous demand that Congress approve funding for his border wall.

...


The wall, of course, was the biggest applause line for Trump throughout his campaign  often taking the form of a call-and-response with his approving crowds. And given how divisive it is, inserting it into must-pass legislation like a government funding bill seemed to be the best way to get what Trump wants.

That's what the White House tried. Office of Management and Budget Chairman Mick Mulvaney said last week that any government-funding bill must include funding for the border wall. Throughout the weekend, top White House aides including Mulvaney suggested Trump might veto a spending bill that doesn't fund his border wall. Chief of staff Reince Priebus told The Post on Sunday that Trump's insistence on that point remained strong.

Fast forward a little more than 24 hours, and Trump apparently abandoned that demand. With still four days to go in the funding battle, he showed his hard-line stance wasn't so hard-line, after all. Basically, he had his bluff called  again.

...

This kind of bluffing and having it called is undoubtedly something Trump is used to in the business and real estate worlds. But in the political world, you are negotiating with the same people over and over again. And the lesson of the first two big congressional debates is that when Trump says a bill must contain XYZ, he doesn't really mean it; it's just posturing. And that doesn't bode well for future Trump demands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This appears to be new reporting and should be upvoted to the front:

The Turkish man who gave Mike Flynn a $600,000 lobbying deal just before President Donald Trump picked him to be national security adviser has business ties to Russia, including a 2009 aviation financing deal negotiated with Vladimir Putin, according to court records.

The man, Ekim Alptekin, has in recent years helped to coordinate Turkish lobbying in Washington with Dmitri David Zaikin, a Soviet-born former executive in Russian energy and mining companies who also has had dealings with Putins government, according to three people with direct knowledge of the activities.

**This unusual arrangement, in which Alptekin and Zaikin have helped steer Turkish lobbying through various groups since at least 2015, raises questions about both the agenda of the two men and the source of the funds used to pay the lobbyists**.

...

Flynn has offered evolving accounts of his lobbying work for Alptekin. In September, Flynn reported his client as a Dutch shell company owned by Alptekin. After being forced to leave the White House  reportedly because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations during the transition with the Russian ambassador  **Flynn filed new paperwork in March acknowledging that his lobbying work principally benefitted the Turkish government.**

**The revelation of Russian business ties to the man who hired Flynn  which has not been previously reported  threatens to complicate the White Houses struggle to escape the shadow of the FBI investigation** into whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with Russian agents.

----

Regardless of what Flynn claims in his retroactive foreign agent disclosure, if it turns out that whatever work Flynn ostensibly did for the Turkish govenrment was actually paid for by the Kremlin through intermediaries, let's just say that might be a tad problematic for the Trump Regime.  </TEXT>

(2) the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolishing that repugnant institution, at great cost in blood;

(3) the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment formally granting former slaves full citizenship and equal protection under the law; and

(4) a Civil Rights Movement to end a century of Jim Crow, during which this illusory promise of full citizenship for blacks existed only on paper.        </TEXT>

I can't fully research the question at the moment.

<TEXT> According to whom and by what criteria? 

I was talking about fundamentals for 2018. In 2016, fundamentals models had a generic Republican winning the popular vote by about 2% against a generic Democrat.

Instead, Clinton won the popular vote by about 2.1%. Pre-Comey, she'd been leading national polling averages by about 6-7% and ended up  at roughly 3-4%. So Clinton slightly underperformed the national polling averages by 1-2% (which were more accurate than 2012), but overperformed the fundamentals models by about 4%. 

In any event, neither the polling based models nor the fundamentals predicted a landslide loss for Trump.

<TEXT> My guess is that you may have misunderstood what your uncle was saying. 

We've placed substantial restrictions on our ballistic missile subs (SSBNs). But we most certainly still have them in active service, and they're still nuclear armed. They're probably the most important leg of the triad. 

We have 18 Ohio-class subs. Originally, all of them were SSBNs. The first 8 subs of the class carried the Trident I (C4) missile, whereas the last 10 subs carried the Trident II (D5), which is currently in service. The 4 subs that carried Trident Is were converted into dedicated cruise missile subs (SSGNs), and their Trident missiles were removed. The other 4 that carried Trident Is were retrofitted to carry the Trident II. So we have 14 active Trident II subs. 

Maybe what your uncle was saying is that we don't have **submarine-launched nuclear cruise missiles**? The US reportedly phased out its tactical nuclear warheads on its submarine launched cruise missiles in the 1990s. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed.  Judge McCullough gets major respect. 

Just as McCullough was able to observe what the NC legislature has done with Governor Cooper, Gorsuch saw what  McConnell and the GOP Senate did to Judge Merrick Garland.

Think about Gorsuch's stature if he'd declined the nomination publiclymaybe even at the press conference where Trump announced it. The media would have been fawning over him. As would people who disagree vehemently with his judicial philosophy.

Trump could of course have withdrawn his nomination on the spot, but it would look terrible. Trump wouldn't be able to undo his prior lifetime appointment by Bush. So in the worst case, Gorsuch goes back to being possibly the most high-profile federal appellate judge in the country (who would very likely get nominated to SCOTUS down the line).

If, on the other hand, Gorsuch managed to somehow persuade Trump to re-nominate Garland (which would have been a smart political move by Trump that would've taken a lot of steam out of the current legitimacy crisis), there'd be tremendous pressure to re-nominate Gorsuch for the next open seat, or if the Garland nomination failed. Democrats would find it almost impossible to deny him an up or down vote after he made such a dramatic stand. Indeed, Gorsuch might have won many of them over to affirmatively supporting him with such a move. He could then take his seat on the Court as a consensus choicewith much more clout than he currently enjoys (he'd be the guy who stood up to Trump rather than the guy having the highest achievement of his legal career handed to him on a silver platter after it was usurped from another deserving jurist).

This type of legitimacy is vital for judges, who lack the power of the sword and purse, and must depend on their integrity and ability to persuade.    </TEXT>

The problem: Bartoss campaign has mixed up Washington with a city in China.

<TEXT> Don't be (assuming you didn't mean it sarcastically). Turnout is cyclical when you take a step back and look at the broader pattern in American history. 

The President's party almost always does badly in midterms. In 39 elections since 1862, it has lost seats in the House (or a share of the House, while it was expanding) in 36 of them. 

[This 538 article does a good job of explaining this with data since the 1920s.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-probably-wont-defy-midterm-gravity/)

 A significant part of this midterm backlash effect stems from the opposition party's base being more mobilized and turning out at a *relatively higher rate* than the President's party's base. Since Obama is no longer in power, we expect Democratic turnout to rebound and Republican turnout to be relatively depressed. But another component is voters who switch sides. They create a 2-vote margin when they swing from the governing party (I know that's a generous term for the GOP) to the opposition.

In 2018, with an unpopular and extremely divisive Republican President facing a legitimacy crisis, I would expect based on the fundamentals to see turnout resemble much  2006 than 2014. Don't be surprised if we get a relatively high turnout (40%) midterm where young people comprise a higher proportion of the electorate than 2010 and 2014, and Democrats retake *at least* the House. 

The Senate will take more doing given the extremely unfavorable map. But it's far from impossible. And at this point I expect most of the Democratic Senators in states Trump won to hold on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno. 2008 was pretty damn emotional. Bush was a terrible President, and he couldn't leave soon enough. His second term (arguably) was better than his firstapart, of course, from that whole global financial meldown and 2nd worst recession in living memory thing at the end. 

Seeing people forget that *so* quickly, by the time the 2010 midterms rolled around, despite the unprecedented GOP obstructionism on Oba's legislative agenda and limited time the electorate afforded hom to start undoing the tremendous damage Bush and the GOP had wrought, was very disheartening.


 But it also showed how strongly cyclical American politics is. And that's why I'm not so worried about 2018just looking forward to it. I remember the relief in 2006 when we *finally* put a check on Bush. And I'm eagerly awaiting that relief again.

Encouraging:

Jon Ossoff benefited from an unusually strong turnout in the first round of voting in Georgias Sixth Congressional District last week, surpassing all recent benchmarks for Democratic turnout in an off-year election, according to an Upshot analysis of newly released voting data.

Past Democratic primary voters represented a larger share of the districts voters than they did in 2016 or 2014, and they turned out in greater numbers than in a typical midterm election.

The election in Georgias Sixth is only the latest in a string of special elections where Democrats have turned out in impressive numbers. Its a reversal from recent off-year elections, when Republicans turned out at far greater rates than Democrats.

...

**The Republican turnout was not weak. Past Republican primary voters turned out at rates that were nearly typical for a midterm  a rare feat for a special election.** It was enough to keep Mr. Ossoff beneath the 50 percent necessary to win outright.

**But Democrats did something even rarer: A larger percentage of Democratic primary voters turned out than did Republican primary voters**, by a four-percentage-point margin. **Even when Democrats surged in successful years nationally in 2006, 2008 and 2012, their turnout of primary voters didnt beat that of the Republicans, either nationwide or in Georgias Sixth.**

...

...Democrats ... did a far better job of turning out younger and less regular voters than the Republicans did. Over all, 56 percent of Democratic primary voters under age 45 turned out to vote, compared with 43 percent of past Republican primary voters of the same age. Similarly, 45 percent of past Democratic primary voters who didnt vote in the 2014 midterm elections ultimately voted, compared with 34 percent of Republicans.

The strong Democratic turnout wasnt the only reason Mr. Ossoff came close to winning last Tuesdays election, and could still win in Junes runoff. **Mr. Ossoff, who won 48 percent of the vote, plainly won a considerable share of past Republican primary voters, who outnumbered Democrats by a margin of 52 percent to 29 percent.** The implication is that Mr. Ossoff probably won 15 to 20 percent of past Republican primary voters, and around two-thirds of those who had never voted in a partisan primary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't disagree with you, but I think there are different contexts that call for different approaches. In an interview like this, on balance, it's probably better to get him rambling a bit and let his mouth get ahead of his mind. At a press conference, though, I would take the exact opposite approach.

Here's part of [a comment that I posted a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5oc9ra/comment/dciehhl) arguing for specific closed-end yes or no questions:


[Trump shouldn't be asked complex open-ended questions]. 

As Trump showed at the recent press conference, he'll ramble all over the place and turn the tables. 

He can't be asked any question that (1) contains multiple parts, (2) has an "and" or an "or," (3) calls for a comparison, or (4) invites any sort of narrative "why" response. Sometimes, you may want Trump to ramble on a subject, but it's better that the rambling be on the "how" rather than the "why"--because "how" isn't his strong point. 

The press needs to treat him as an an attorney treats a hostile witness on cross-examination. 

Short, pointed, single-issue factual questions that are hard to dodge (and that you likely already know the answer to through background research). There's no way to get real information out of him directly. So you force him to contradict his prior statements, official positions, or make ill-considered inadvertent admissions.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Key issue: this may not be revenue neutral. So it ordinarily would not be subject to reconciliation under the Byrd Rule. Theoretically, it could therefore be stopped by a Senate filibuster:

President Trump wants his administration to draft a tax plan that would cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

The Journal, citing "a person familiar with the directive," reported that Trump told his staff last week that he wants to be able to sell a large tax cut to the public and is **less concerned about the proposal adding to the deficit.**

...

The corporate tax rate is currently 35 percent. Trump also proposed a 15 percent rate during his presidential campaign, while the House Republicans' tax plan proposes lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.

Now, if Trump thinks he can sell this to the American People in order to break a likely Democratic filibuster politically, he's deluded (always a distinct possibility with him). [A recent Pew poll](https://twitter.com/pewresearch/status/856335640564301825) showed that 62% of the public thinks some corporations don't pay their fair share of taxes. That's the highest of any of the categories polled.

So unless he's setting himself up for failure, or has been beenly advised about what's possible under existing Senate procedure, maybe he intends to have his GOP Senate allies pull a nuclear option to broaden the scope of the Byrd Rule or simply kill the legislative filibuster.  </TEXT>

Next we should look carefully at the anticipated long-term ramifications of that support compared to the next-best alternative. Then we need to do our best to identify unknowns and uncertainties and vigorously debate the alternatives in a context that encourages and respects dissent. *Only then* should the President decide among competing policies. (I can't imagine the Orange One doing a quarter of this).

And, even when you have a robust policymaking process, you can still fuck up.

(3) against the advice of subordinates and superiors, and in violation of long-established  DoJ and general investigatory protocol;

(4) while applying a completely different standard to public disclosure of the FBI's *still ongoing* investigation of Clinton's opponent (*see my reply to the post above*);

 and 

(5) just 10 days before the electionwhile millions of people were already votinghaving apparently calculated, in part, that Clinton was far enough ahead that it wouldn't matter (which would be totally inappropriate *even if* Comey were correct because of the letters' potential impacts on the victory margin as well as downballot races).


In his unshakable self-righteousness, Comey was convinced that his own moral compass and judgment was correct and that *everyone else was wrong.* The result: President* Trump. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch. *Majority* Leader McConnell.

Here's [Kevin Drum's excellent compilation](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/04/lets-talk-about-bubbles-and-james-comey) of evidence.

Were there *other* factors that could *also* have tipped this extraordinarily close election? Absolutely. In law, this is called **concurrent causation**. 

Comey is a particularly important cause because it's quantitatively discernible with a high degree of statistical confidence, and has such important prospective implications for our democracy.    

As Drum points out in his piece above, the claim that Comey *didn't* cause Clinton's loss seldomif everengages and tries to reconcile this overwhelming evidence. For my part, I've yet to see even an attempt to do so.

<TEXT> You're right that it isn't the full story.

Comey's letter to Chaffetz (and earlier editorializing while declining to make a criminal referral in July 2016) *shredded* the long-established norms for investigations. 


Excerpt from [the long NYT piece yesterday addressing Comey's unprecedented actions](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/us/politics/james-comey-election.html?_r=0 referer=https://t.co/gU4pdevSXc):


**An examination by The New York Times, based on interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement, congressional and other government officials, found that while partisanship was not a factor in Mr. Comeys approach to the two investigations, he handled them in starkly different ways**. ***In the case of Mrs. Clinton, he rewrote the script, partly based on the F.B.I.s expectation that she would win and fearing the bureau would be accused of helping her. In the case of Mr. Trump, he conducted the investigation by the book, with the F.B.I.s traditional secrecy.*** Many of the officials discussed the investigations on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.

...

Mr. Comey and other senior administration officials met twice in the White House Situation Room in early October to again discuss a public statement about Russian meddling. But the roles were reversed: Susan Rice, the national security adviser, wanted to move ahead. **Mr. Comey was less interested in being involved.**

At their second meeting, ***Mr. Comey argued that it would look too political for the F.B.I. to comment so close to the election, according to several people in attendance. Officials in the room felt whiplashed. Two months earlier, Mr. Comey had been willing to put his name on a newspaper article; now he was refusing to sign on to an official assessment of the intelligence community.***

Mr. Comey said that in the intervening time, Russian meddling had become the subject of news stories and a topic of national discussion. He felt it was no longer necessary for him to speak publicly about it. **So when Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, and James R. Clapper Jr., the national intelligence director, accused Russias senior-most officials on Oct. 7 of a cyber operation to disrupt the election, the F.B.I. was conspicuously silent.**

***That night, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of hacked emails from another source: the private email account of John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign.***

Comey may be far better than whomever the Orange One would replace him with. But he's no misunderstood hero in this story. If it weren't for his misconduct, we would have Trump as President.

<TEXT> How is this Comey propaganda?

This piece is *criticizing* Comey, and arguing that whatever Clinton's mistakes and shortcomings as a candidate, they don't absolve him of responsibility for his election-altering misconduct.

That conclusion seems unassailable. And [Comey is under investigation by the DoJ inspector General because of it](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-emails-doj-inspector-general-investigate-fbi-comey-actions-n706186).

<TEXT> #####**Yes, Comey mattered  a lot**

**Its strange that people are even debating  point**. After all, just after the election, it was widely established that top officials in both the Clinton and Trump campaigns saw Comeys announcement of newly-discovered emails as a game changer. For instance, see this piece from Politicos Glenn Thrush, which reported that to be the case. Thrush noted that Clintons chief data analytics guru saw her numbers tank among a crucial demographic: educated white voters who had been alienated by Trumps videotaped boasts of lewd groping and subsequent allegations of unwanted advances.

Meanwhile, elections analyst Nate Silver concluded that without Comey and the Russia hacking, states like Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania  which Trump won by excruciatingly tight margins  might have tipped to Clinton. Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race, Silver said.

In other words, if Comey had never taken that step, we might currently be discussing the staying power of the Obama coalition and the success of the Clinton strategy  in particular, the emphasis on attacking Trumps dangerously unhinged temperament, and his campaign of racism, hate, and abuse directed at Mexican immigrants and women  in driving college-educated whites into the Democratic camp.

**It is often argued that Comey is not responsible for Clintons loss, because he did not force her to set up a private server, or de-emphasize her economic message, or neglect the Rust Belt.** But this argument is weak. It can be true that Clinton was a very flawed candidate who made mistakes, even as it is also true that **Comeys letter had a major impact on the outcome  and potentially a decisive one  without which the Clinton strategy might have prevailed.** Given that the **Comey revelations ended up amounting to nothing in substantive terms, the fact that his decision did have such a large impact reveals his handling of the whole mess to be indefensible and reflects terribly on our political process**. Clintons real failings should not be permitted to minimize the significance of that.

It was not unreasonable for the Clinton team to conclude that the strategy of casting Trump as temperamentally unfit to handle national security  and too hateful and divisive to lead our diverse country  was going to succeed. Polls indicated for months that Clinton was on track to become the first Democrat to win a majority of college-educated whites in over half a century. Many analysts across the spectrum had concluded that such an outcome would probably cripple Trumps ability to prevail by running up enormous margins among white voters.

**And whatever the Clinton teams motives in making a big issue out of Trumps race-tinged campaign, it was the right thing to do.** For all the talk about Clinton playing identity politics, the candidate who played identity politics to a far greater extent was Donald Trump. His campaign  which fused the relentless scapegoating of Muslims and undocumented immigrants with revanchist appeals to **Make America Great Again  was all about encouraging and playing to a sense that white identity and white America were under siege. It was important for the country that Clinton call out Trumps white nationalist appeals for what they were  and that she defend the minority groups that he had targeted for vilification. Not doing so would have been an abdication.**

<TEXT> Lichtblau is Russian deza of the highest order. Did you also post his article about how the FBI found no clear links to Russia in its investigation back in October? 

As it happens, [I was actually the one who posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5af8ku/was_a_trump_server_communicating_with_russia/?sort=confidence) the Slate article about [the Trump server suspiciously communicating with Alfabank](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html) that the [NYT article you're referring to](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html) was used to quash*even though* [the FBI is apparently *still* investigating that potential link](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/09/politics/fbi-investigation-continues-into-odd-computer-link-between-russian-bank-and-trump-organization/). 

I've been highly critical of the October 31 NYT articlewhich *still* hasn't been retracted by the NYT, even though [it's garbage](https://mediamatters.org/blog/2017/01/17/when-new-york-times-helped-trump-putting-brakes-russian-hacking-story/215027). 

Good eye in noting that Lichtblau had the byline on that article as well as this one. I hadn't noticed that. But also note that Matt Apuzzo, Michael S. Schmidt, and Adam Goldman all have bylines *before* Lichtblau on this article, which directly contradicts the October 31 piece. 

I suggest that, in the future, you should check people's posting history before you make baseless accusations of shillingwhich, besides embarrassing you, are against the basic rules of this sub. 

Hillary Clinton's shit campaign cost Hillary the election, full stop. It's her job to get people to the polls for her - her and her staff. Russian deza didn't cast any ballots and neither did James Comey... except for his. If you don't like that his investigation into Clinton's illegal behavior made her look bad, maybe you can cry me a river.

I'm not going to waste time laying out Comey's misconduct again or re-arguing how the improper letter was decisive when a swing of 39K votes allocated among three states tipped the election. I've already linked to fully elaborated analyses of both issues. [I'm not the only one](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/04/lets-talk-about-bubbles-and-james-comey) with [this assessment](http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/1/11/14215930/comey-email-election-clinton-campaign). [Not by a longshot](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/855798547505180673).

 Clinton made mistakes in her campaign. Ive never denied that. But blaming her loss all on these mistakeswhile failing to recognize the role of the Russian interference campaign, Comey, or the [false equivalence and double standards in the media's reporting of the Clinton campaign](https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-2016-general-election/)is far too tidy and oversimplified.

Most of what I posted was an excerpt from the NYT article. 

Comey's letter almost certainly cost Clinton the election. 

Russia's DNC/Podesta email dump via Wiikileaks and "active measures," together with Trump's use of the hacked information, probably also were enough to tip the election. 

Those statements are totally consistent, if you're suggesting that holding Comey accountable for his misconduct somehow exonerates the Kremlin (it doesn't).

As [I said a week before the vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/the_fbi_is_trumpland_anticlinton_atmosphere/d9kctvb), Comey's improper actions made me feel like we were living in a banana republic.

-----

Some key excerpts from this article:

**Should you consider what youre about to do may help elect Donald Trump president?** an adviser asked him, Mr. Comey recalled recently at a closed meeting with F.B.I. agents.

**He could not let politics affect his decision**, he replied. If we ever start considering who might be affected, and in what way, by what we do, were done, he told the agents.

**But with polls showing Mrs. Clinton holding a comfortable lead, Mr. Comey ended up plunging the F.B.I. into the molten center of a bitter election**. Fearing the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I. had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret, Mr. Comey sent a letter informing Congress that the case was reopened.

**What he did not say was that the F.B.I. was also investigating the campaign of Donald J. Trump. Just weeks before, Mr. Comey had declined to answer a question from Congress about whether there was such an investigation**. Only in March, long after the election, did Mr. Comey confirm that there was one.

For Mr. Comey, keeping the F.B.I. out of politics is such a preoccupation that he once said he would never play basketball with President Barack Obama because of the appearance of being chummy with the man who appointed him. But in the final months of the presidential campaign, the leader of the nations pre-eminent law enforcement agency shaped the contours, if not the outcome [*note: it totally altered the outcome*](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2), of the presidential race by his handling of the Clinton and Trump-related investigations.

...

**An examination by The New York Times, based on interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement, congressional and other government officials, found that while partisanship was not a factor in Mr. Comeys approach to the two investigations, he handled them in starkly different ways**. ***In the case of Mrs. Clinton, he rewrote the script, partly based on the F.B.I.s expectation that she would win and fearing the bureau would be accused of helping her. In the case of Mr. Trump, he conducted the investigation by the book, with the F.B.I.s traditional secrecy.*** Many of the officials discussed the investigations on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.

**Mr. Comey made those decisions with the supreme self-confidence of a former prosecutor** who, in a distinguished career, has cultivated a reputation for what supporters see as fierce independence, and detractors view as **media-savvy arrogance**.

-----

Here's another key point made by this piece, underscoring that Comey also blew it on the Russia interference:

Mr. Comey and other senior administration officials met twice in the White House Situation Room in early October to again discuss a public statement about Russian meddling. But the roles were reversed: Susan Rice, the national security adviser, wanted to move ahead. **Mr. Comey was less interested in being involved.**

At their second meeting, ***Mr. Comey argued that it would look too political for the F.B.I. to comment so close to the election, according to several people in attendance.

***That night, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of hacked emails from another source: the private email account of John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign.***

<TEXT> I would hardly call the U.S. system from January 2011 - January 2017 a grand coalition. Genuine grand coalitions are based on the idea of compromise to depoliticize the essential consensus items. What we had was more of a cold war/stalemate based on wanting to avoid mutually unacceptable outcomes (default on U.S. debt) with certain areas off limits after previous confrontations almost went awry. We've been living under sequester-budget continuing resolutions for years. 

Supermajority requirements for basic legislation perpetuate dysfunction by screwing up accountability. Majoritarian parliamentary systems at least make it easy for the average person to figure out who's in charge so they can hold them accountable for the consequences of what they do (or don't). The opposition can't sabotage policies or force the governing party to water them down. But the governing party also can't blame the opposition for anything that doesn't work. Over time, this encourages parties to think twice as well as rely on facts and sound analysis before changing policies, because they'll own the changes.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fully agree the Senate is hard in 2018. But it's not impossible.

In a midterm environment, with the other party holding the Presidency, the Democratic Senate seats up for re-election are defensible. [Cook currently has these seats as 12 solid, 8 likely, and 5 lean D](http://cookpolitical.com/senate/charts/race-ratings), with no tossups. [Sabato rates them](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/content/images//2017-02-16_Senate_Map_600.png) as 11 safe, 5 likely, 6 lean, and 3 tossups. The risks of losing each seat isn't independent either. Rather, they tend to be highly correlated such that seats will often flip together. And the more nationalized these Senate races are, the greater this correlated effect. 

In 1970, Democrats faced a 25 D-8 R map with Nixon at 58% approval. 13 Democratic seats were in states that Nixon won (vs  10 Dems in Trump states). Yet, they ended up holding losses to only 2-3 seats (depending on how you count Sen. Byrd re-labelling himself an independent for that term but continuing to caucus with Dems) and gained 12 seats in the House. This was a pretty good outcome... for Nixon. I think the realistic best case for Trump is something like that. 

With that said, Dems taking outright Senate control in 2018 likely won't happen outside of the catastrophic backlash scenario. If it does, I think the best path is prorbably NV, AZ, and [TX](http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/329445-poll-shows-cruz-losing-to-texas-dem-castro)
 (or possibly TN, [if Corker retires as he's hinting he may](http://www.wbir.com/mb/news/politics/sen-bob-corker-not-yet-ready-to-say-whether-he-will-run-for-third-term/432097887?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTVRreVptVTVZell6WXpGayIsInQiOiI0RjUybm1QSkhYOWFZOFppT1N2amp4THIxcDNtM3Rva3h1ZGVOSzFWK3NBYWM1Q1BnTjV5OG9oOGRTcFZqM1dydER3YXdsRUp1OVJwM0VLMDg3d3V1SjJlMUEwM2dhQkJobm5IQTM1TDI4MnREUytIdUZXcGtKM01pUHg2SjZoZiJ9)).

Another possible path would be a 50:50 Senate where a Republican Senator abstains and denies Pence the ability to cast the tiebreaking vote. Then you'd get 50 Schumer - 49 McConnell - 1 Abstention. I could see this happening, for example, [if McMullin (a never Trumper) beats Hatch in UT](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865678241/Poll-Evan-McMullin-beats-Sen-Orrin-Hatch-in-head-to-head-matchup.html) and McConnell has been exerting partisan pressure or errecting other roadblocks for the the Senate Intel Committee's Trump-Russia investigation (which McMullin strongly favors). Admittedly, the likelihood of this last scenario is pretty remote. But even in a 50:50 Senate controlled by Republicans, Dems would have equal staff and committee representation, making it much harder for Trump to get anything done without genuine bipartisanship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't talking about 2020, but 2018. 

You're right that a ton can change in 6 months, but I think it's fairly safe to say that Trump will not be popular enoughbased on everything we know so farto "win" the 2018 midterms.

*First*, like I said, Trump is *already* facing a legitimacy crisis, having lost the popular vote by a large margin, then pushing controversial appointments and a hard right agenda for which he had a weak mandate. He *didn't even try* to reach out and expand his relatively narrow starting base. Just as importantly, there's the Russian election subversion scandal. Until and if there's a thorough independent investigationwhich a large majority of the public says it wantsand such an investigation clears his campaign of any wrongdoing (which seems increasingly unlikely), the scandal isn't going away. Trump missed his own self-imposed deadline yesterday to provide a report on the hacking and interference, and he seems intent on stonewalling and trying to change the subject. That strategy can, *at most*, buy a bit of time or run down the clock. (I assume for purposes of this analysis that conclusive proof of an explicit agreement and *quid pro quo* between the Kremlin and Trump campaign *does not* come to light during before 2018.)

*Second*, let's come back to basic regularities of American politics. In 36 out of 39 midterms since the Civil War, the President's party has lost seats or a relative share of the House (while it was still growing). Trump has the lowest first quarter approval rating of any President in the history of polling. Democrats have suddenly become competitive in special elections held in Congressional districts that are significantly more Republican than the country overall.

Can Trump turn it around? Perhaps. But successfully doing so likely means limiting Republican losses to fewer than 24 seats in the House and picking off 1-3 incumbent Democratic Senators. More likely, he faces more typical/average first-midterm setback, which would be enough to flip the House and possibly net 0-2 new Democratic seats in the Senate. But Trump could also face a catastrophic 1994 or 2010 style wave that flips the Senate (despite the unfavorable map) and gives Democrats a working majority in the House. The last scenario is more likely than Trump somehow storming to the 60%+ approval rating that he'd need to defy historical odds and actually gain seats in the House. Nothing in his life or short political career has shown that he has the competencelet alone the inclinationto build that kind of consensus. 

Wracking my brain, I think it would take a major terrorist attack (for which he was not perceived by the public as negligent, which could be tough, given his disengagement from Intel briefings and lack of attention to details) and accompanying rally-around-the-flag effect. Domestic legislative achievements likely won't do it, because even if he manages to address the dysfunction of the House Republican caucus so that he can pass things, the things he wants to passlike repeal and replacement of the ACAare highly unpopular and would actually damage his prospects for 2018.

So, in sum, **over Trunp's plausible range of popularity, I think he almost certainly loses at least a dozen seats in the 2018 midterms, more likely than not flipping control of the House in the process.** And I think that a catastrophic backlash is more likely than a dramatic rebound. I don't think this analysis assumes and depends on him being especially unpopular. The point can't be emphasized enough: [midterms are brutal](http://imgur.com/M0So3BX) to the [President's party](http://imgur.com/VcIwq0v).

<TEXT> It's somewhat of an arbitrary deadline, yes. There's no rule that presidents have to have signed X number of bills into law by the first 100 days of their presidency or else.

Nonetheless, it's a deadline that presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt have been measured up against. And no modern president who has struggled in the first 100 days has suddenly revved up in the next 100, nor in the next couple of years.

Presidents who failed to sign any major piece of legislation in the first 100 days  especially presidents whose parties also controlled Congress  have sputtered in their first couple of years, too, said Brooklyn College history professor and presidential scholar Robert David Johnson. And that should be a major warning sign to President Trump, who on Friday tacitly acknowledged he has had a lackluster start.

...

You could also argue that a productive 100 days isn't indicative of a productive presidency...

But with regard to failure, a meh 100 days has historically been a pretty good measure of a meh first few years.

Speaking of failure, you could also argue Trump has set himself up for this. Up until the health-care implosion, he was pretty clear that the 100 days construct matters. More explicitly than any other president who came before him, he laid out exactly what he was going to get done in these first few months  renegotiate trade deals, military alliances, tax cuts, address Russian hacking.

None of that has come to fruition.

Past presidents spinning their wheels at the 100-day mark have subsequently struggled to make something out of nothing. Which is why 100 days may not be a ridiculous standard to measure a president by. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eh, youth turnout in 2014 was the lowest in 40 years. 

This can be explained mostly with basic political dynamics without resorting to anything specific about Millennials.

 See below.

Presidential turnout was better than the hole it fell into between Gore and Clinton, but didn't quite beat the 1992 high. It's mostly been a general decline since the 1970s.



[Turnout as a percentage of the Voting Elligible Population (VEP)](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/content/images/GVS2017030201-chart1.png) in 1992, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 was higher than any Presidential election between 1972 and 1988 (a period during which you could see a gradual decline). In turn, 2004-2016 all have higher turnout than 1992. The recent high record turnout for a Presidential election is 2008 (61.6% VEP).

Turnout for midterms has been fairly steady, with minor oscillations around 39-40%. 2002, 2006, and 2010 had gradually increasing turnout, and each of these elections had turnout higher than 1974 and 1978. 

2014 is the low outlier (35.9%). Notably, though, the next two miderms with the lowest turnout were 1986 (38.1%) and 1998 (38.1%)both also in the 6th year of a two-term Presidency. Historically, this is the election where even popular Presidents can have their parties' ranks in Congress get decimated (absent unusual circumstanceslike the partisan impeachment of Clinton, which the public broadly opposed). 

I'd propose that the low 2014 youth turnout can be understood mostly as a product of these regular dynamics. 

*First*, the President's party almost always does badly in midterms. A large part of that is because the opposition's base is more mobilized and turns out at a higher rate than the President's party's base. Since Obama was in power, and Millenials vote disproportionately Democratic, we'd expect *relatively* lower turnout. Plus it was a 6th year midterm. And keep in mind that midterms have a lower baseline of youth turnout to begin with. *Second*, you had President Obama near the lowpoint (40%) of his approval. So when you combine these effects, it's not hard to see why youth turnout was historically low.

Compare this to 2006, where you had Bush at 38% approval in a 6th-year midterm. Unlike in 1986, 1998 or 2014, turnout was relatively high by midterm standards, at 40.4%. [A slightly lower % of Millennials and GenX'ers identified as Democrats](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/03/20144206/FT_17.03.16_generations_ideology_detailed.png) in 2006 (47/44) than in 2014 (49/48), and they represented different proportions of the electorate due to aging. Yet, turnout among 18-29 year-olds was [significantly higher in 2006 (25.5%)](http://civicyouth.org/youth-voter-turnout-increases-in-2006/) and increased by relatively more than it did among older (and more Republican) voters. For comparison, turnout among younger voters fell off a cliff [in 2014 (19.9%)](http://civicyouth.org/2014-youth-turnout-and-youth-registration-rates-lowest-ever-recorded-changes-essential-in-2016/) but declined relatively less for older voters.

In 2018, with an unpopular and divisive Republican President facing a legitimacy crisis, I would expect based on the fundamentals to see something much more akin to 2006 than 2014. Don't be surprised if we get a relatively high turnout (40%) midterm where young people comprise a higher proportion of the electorate than 2010 and 2014, and Democrats retake *at least* the House.

<TEXT> (**Psst! You're still on fire from that burn.**)

You can't have it both ways.

You're arguing that Sessions referring to Hawaii (the State) as a singular island is factual because the big island in the chain is called Hawaii. 

Yet the seat of federal district court that issued the ruling is Oahua separate island. 

Thus, if Sessions was referring only to the island of Hawaii, versus the State of Hawaii or the Hawaiian Islands, he was *excluding* the very court he was criticizing. And if he referred to the entire State of Hawaii as an islandbecause that's close enoughhe committed a cultural *faux pas* and was just flat wrong.

So, no, Sessions' statement was not factual or technically correct. In addition to disparaging the State of Hawaii, its residents, and Judge Derrick Watson, he was *technically incorrect*.

<TEXT> I think that's a bullshit criticism from Ellis. It's a mistake to interpret the election results without factoring Comey and the selective Wikileaks disclosures (or the Kremlin's "active measures" to amplify them with fake news and social media bots). Comey's vague and improper letter, in particular, sucked up all the bandwidth for substantive issue discussions. The damage from this letter can't be underestimated. In addition to [tipping the election to Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2), it sabotaged the campaign's closing argument for downballot Democrats. 

In late October, with Clinton up 6-7 points, her campaign and [Obama began to pivot to an attack against the dysfunctional Republican Congress](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/25/politics/obama-unleashed/) in order to build on the momentum from Clinton's [three dominant debate performances](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-probably-finished-off-trump-last-night/) and tie Congressional Republicans to the cratering Trumpwho they refused to disavow. The whole election had been gradually building to this decisive moment. Then, right in the middle of it, the Comey letter hit and yanked the football away, changing the narrative and reenergizing the flailing Trump campaign. The rest of the campaign was defense against Trump's exaggerated characterizations and outright fabrications of what the new emails contained. Democrats dropped across the board in the Senate polls and generic Congressional ballot. 

And we got what we got.        </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. I also don't care about the superficial bullshit. Pelosi is not an entertainer. She's the most effective and consequential Democratic Speaker since Sam Rayburn. She knows how to build consensus in her caucus, count votes, and twist arms. The 111th Congress got more done under Pelosi than any Congress since the 60s. The ACA should be called Pelosicare just as much as Obamacare. 

Beyond the legislative accomplishments, Pelosi also led at key times. TARP (under Bush) together the Recovery Act (under Obama) saved us from another Depression. Both of these things passed because of Pelosi. TARP, in particular, was not popular. But it backstopped the economic freefall and has made back the money taxpayers spent. If the downturn had happened under a Democrat, could you see Republicans taking an unpopular vote like that? Hell. One doesn't have to imagine. Just look at what Boehner did in 2009 with the Recovery Act itself. Not a single Republican voted for it in the Housedespite Obama's best efforts at bipartisanship, at a time the economy was *losing 800K jobs per month*. 

It's a real shame she lost her majority in 2010. We'd probably have gotten the DREAM act and comprehensive immigration reform, cap   trade (which passed the House), an infrastructure bill and second stimulus, universal background checks, a regular budget without sequester cuts, the Buffet rule (30% minimum tax to avoid exploitation of loopholes by extremely wealthy), card check (to make unionizing easier), and the list goes on.

<TEXT> The House Freedom Caucus finds community rating (spreading costs more equitably over healthy and sick people) deeply objectionable because they don't believe in solidarity and pooling of resources to solve problems. If you are lucky to be healthy, great. You shouldn't have to pay for anyone else and should have the cheapest insurance possible. And, if you're sick, you should have to pay your own way. Something something bootstraps.

The way they get around not doing away with the ban on pre-existing condition exclusions (while abolishing the individual mandate that makes this possible) is to make it so that you have to buy coverage for specific conditions (*i.e.* plans will no longer be required to cover a minimum basket of things) sort of like a menu. The problem is that if you choose to buy a coverage add on, it's extremely likely because you intend to use it. But the insurance companies know this. Since people who don't think they'll need coverage won't buy it, there's no broad healthy pool to spread the cost over. So insurers will charge whatever premium that's enough to pay for what you will likely need. That, in turn, will make coverage so expensive that the vast majority of those who need it simply won't be able to afford it. 

What this plan considers important is **access***i.e.*, the theoretical option and right to buy coverage *if you had the money*, even though, in practice, *you don't have the money* and therefore lack the **ability** to buy coverage.            </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course Trump hasn't even started. It's a lose-lose for him. When he made this promise, he was calculating that the whole thing would've blown over by now and no one would seriously call him on it.

Suppose Trump were to put out a genuine, thorough, fact-based report. It would show that Russia interfered in the election to help him. We already know that. He was even forced to acknowledge Russian interference. If he were to turn the investigators loose on his campaign's involvement with the Russian intererence, it would turn up, *at minimum*, exploitation of the hacked information with knowledge that it was unlawfully obtained by Russia.

Alternatively, imagine that Trump puts out a whitewash report that completely exculpates him. That too would only intensify the calls for an independent investigation. If there *were* actually a completely innocent explanation for what's occurred, they would have already put it out there. High-level Trump Regime officials wouldn't be conspiring with Nunesthe person who was ostensibly supposed to be investigating the Regimeto manufacture too-clever-by-half pseudo-scandals to change the subject to Obama. Further, Trump wouldn't be focusing on leakers, but putting out information to refute the actual contents of the leaks to make his opponents look foolish for believing them. The unexplained and possibly indefinite delay in releasing this promised report shows that they can't even fabricate a halfway-colorable cover story for themselves.

Trump's only viable defensive play is stonewalling and distraction. He can hope that there isn't enough evidence to conclusively prove what happened and that  he can run out the clock as the investigation loses steam. In the meantime, he can try to change the subjectas he did fairly successfully with the Syria strike and North Korea saber rattling. 

It's our job to keep the public and the media focused like a laser on the Russian election interference until there are satisfactory answers.

<TEXT> Vladimir Putin is seizing on mixed signals from the U.S. to quietly tighten Russias grip on [two rebel regions of Ukraine](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ikWuvkTDuFTw/v3/1400x-1.png), burying hopes for a European-brokered peace deal and relief from sanctions anytime soon.

While the Kremlin continues to publicly back the accord that Germany and France oversaw in 2015, Putins real strategy in Ukraine is to fully separate the two border areas known as the Donbas through incremental integration with Russia, three people close to the leadership in Moscow said. He has no plans to recognize or annex the territories, they said.


Russia has been moving gradually, using a blockade by Ukrainian activists as political cover to take over key economic links with the separatist zones. Last week, Russian Railways slashed rates for shipping coal and iron ore to points near the rebel areas, where the metals industry provides most jobs. That will allow Russia to replace Ukrainian supplies halted by Kiev and ensure that steel plants continue to function, according to two people in the industry.

...

Earlier this year, Putin angered his Ukrainian counterpart, Petro Poroshenko, by signing a decree recognizing passports and other documents issued by the separatist governments in Luhansk and Donetsk, which have already declared the ruble their official currency. The Kremlin is also considering making it easier for the 2 million residents of the regions to become Russian citizens, which would dramatically complicate any attempt by Kiev to reassert control.

Moscow is implementing the so-called Transnistria scenario, according to the deputy head of Poroshenkos administration, Kostiantyn Yelisieiev, referring to the breakaway region in the former Soviet republic of Moldova, which hosts Russian troops but has no citizenship agreements with Russia.

Russia supports a string of separatist regions in former Soviet republics, using them as leverage over pro-Western governments in what it considers to be its sphere of influence. In 2008, Russia sent troops into Georgia to secure two such areas that are now essentially Kremlin protectorates. Last month, Russia absorbed some of the militias there into its regular army.

...


Putins moves in Ukraine pose a challenge to the U.S. and the European Union, which publicly support the 2015 Minsk accord that calls for Ukraine to regain control of the Donbas. A collapse of the deal would be a major blow to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whos spent a lot of political capital trying to end the worst violence Europes seen since the the Balkan wars of the 1990s. The three-year conflict has killed 10,000 people and displaced 2 million more.

President Donald Trumps administration ... has sent mixed signals on its stance and even appears to be totally uninterested in the conflict, as one senior Russian diplomat put it. Trump has taken a tough line rhetorically, though he hasnt made his position clear and the White House seems focused on issues it considers more pressing like Syria and North Korea.

...

With the Minsk accord now basically at a dead end, the Donbas is drifting into a frozen conflict that may last decades.

<TEXT> This is the heart of it:

[T]he [Trump] campaign's descriptions of Page's role - including how he got it and how long he served in it - have varied and in some cases contradict each other. The conflicting explanations have raised questions about why no one seems to know for sure, or at least isn't willing to say, who brought Page on - and why.

Page's personal and professional history offers no hint of an interest in American politics or foreign policy, except for occasional blog posts between 2013 and 2014 in which he criticized the US sanctions on Russia as "sanctimonious expressions of moral superiority" and praised Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin for his "accomplishments" in advancing US-Russia relations.


The Trump campaign's explanation of Page's role is completely incoherent. And they still haven't given a plausible explanation for how this previously unknown political operative was brought into the campaign into such an important role. The whole thing looks incredibly shady. And their distancing themselves from him after the fact (as well as from Manafort*who ran the campaign*) only adds suspicion.  

Following the money would help here. But for that, among other things, we need documentation of the Roseneft deal, including the ownership structure of the various entities involved in it. 

More than anything, there needs to be a public presentation of the evidence. This is too important to be done behind closed doors. At some point, the window of opportunity to put country before party will close. If Republicans won't investigate, then Democrats need to weaponize this issue politically because the public is on their side. From [today's PPP poll](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2017/04/democrats-have-big-enthusiasm-edge-for-2018.html):

-The Russia issue isn't going anywhere- **61% of voters want an independent investigation into Russia's involvement in the 2016 Presidential election and ties to key Trump aides, compared to only 29% of voters opposed to such an investigation**. A majority of voters- **55%- continues to believe that Russia wanted Trump to win the election to only 22% who think it wanted Clinton to win** (although Trump voters claim 42/22 that they think it wanted Clinton to win.)

The finding of an independent investigation could be devastating to Trump's presidency. Right now voters are pretty evenly divided with 41% believing members of Trump's campaign team worked in association with Russia to help Trump win the election and 40% saying they don't think there was any direct coordination. **But if it does come out that Russia and Trump's team were working together, only 38% of voters think Trump should continue serving as President to 52% who think he should resign.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that it resembles a veto because it's negating something rather than affirmatively proposing, but it still needs bicameral approval and presentment for Presidential approval or a veto override. 

So it's more like regular legislation than the sort of legislative veto that was ruled unconstitutional in [*INS v. Chadha*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2221871582286121199 q=462+U.S.+919+\(1983\) hl=en as_sdt=2006), 462 U.S. 919 (1983).      </TEXT>

Because of his potential influence as a formal participant with veto power in the legislative process, it's appropriate to assign some accountability to the President. 

If he finds his own party incapable of enacting policy that he believes is beneficial and necessary for the country as a whole, he has the option of reaching out to the other side and trying to cobble together a bipartisan coalition. Trump hasn't even tried. His closest attempt at this was threatening to sabotage the ACA and hold the healthcare of millions of people hostage in order to extract concessions from Democrats. Democrats, as the opposition, have no obligation to help him govern--especially to implement policies that they disagree with. If he wants their help, he needs to offer something worthwhile in return. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, there's a difference between selective disclosure of facts to create a misleading impression, on the one hand, versus focusing on a particular fact or set of facts that appear significant from a editorial standpoint in order to advocate for a specific disclosed partisan agenda, on the other hand. Here, there's no secret that ShareBlue's agenda is damaging the Trump Regime politically with factual information and opinion so as to facilitate its expeditious removal from power.

The beauty of Reddit is that it allows the community to upvote and downvote what it finds worthy. The proper filter here is the collective judgment of this sub, as well as the individual judgment of the submitter (me)--who can suffer reputational consequences for shitposting.

I think that a categorical exclusion of partisan sources would be worse than the problem it seeks to solve--with certain exceptions, since I think it's justified to impose bright line rules to impede dissemination of fabricated and objectively false information. Generally though, I think submissions should be judged on their merits, as well as the merits and practices of their sources and publishers. 

For my part, I have no regrets about posting this story. ShareBlue is not publishing false information here. Moreover, ShareBlue represents a minuscule fraction of media market share, and the views of its editors and owners are not excluding competing views from this sub in any way. If these stories have gained prominence in recent weeks, it's because they have conveyed relevant information to people in a form that they found both useful and appealing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Counter-counter argument:

Not always. ShareBlue sometimes beats those organizations to the punch, possibly because, in exercising their editorial discretion, those organizations didn't consider the same aspect of a story to be particularly noteworthy. 

More importantly though, if I run across a story that I think is worth sharing, and I trust that ShareBlue is accurately reporting underlying facts that I find significant, I shouldn't be compelled to hunt for another source just to placate the minority of people on this sub who want to harp constantly on the fact that ShareBlue's reporting and commentary is from a *clearly disclosed* pro-Democratic, anti-Trump vantage point. 

I of course have the *option* of looking for another source that people of the opposite political persuasion might be more willing to accept. Or I can simply let a ShareBlue submission fight it out in the marketplace of ideas of this sub, which is what I did here. I thought this specific piece had a great headline and would spark a good discussion--and it has, including about how [repeals of administrative regulations via the Congressional Review Act are fundamentally legislative, not executive, in character](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/66byny/sean_spicer_cant_name_a_single_legislative/dghae7e/).

<TEXT> Not as legislative accomplishments, no. But judges can get credit for the ways in which they uphold specific laws. Take John Roberts' two decisions upholding the ACA. 

More importantly though, there are important distinctions between what Presidents and Judges do. 

In upholding or striking down a law, Judges are generally announcing that the law does or doesn't comport with the Constitution. In other words, they're answering the question of *whether the law is permitted*--not whether it's a good idea. If it's not permitted, then the law is void due to the conflict with the higher law, the Constitution. When reaching such a decision, judges should avoid consideration of whether permissible laws are desirable or not (though there is a place for considering potential consequences when deciding how a law should be interpreted--in part to decide what the legislature intended.) 

A President, on the other hand, has direct and indirect input into the drafting and enactment of the law. And once a bill lands on his desk, he can choose to allow it to become law or not. That's an essentially legislative function. Unlike a judge, it's not only permitted, but expected, that his decision be based on whether he thinks the law is good substantive policy. 

Hypothetically, a President who knows something about the Constitution can also exercise his veto with Constitutional issues in mind. But even if he's an expert constitutional lawyer, his opinion on these questions doesn't bind the other branches like a judicial opinion does.

<TEXT> There are lots of good proposals for reforming SCOTUS and other institutions. But it would likely take most if not all of the next President's initial political capital to push these institutional and process reforms through. Republicans would scream bloody murder--even if the changes were intended to benefit no particular party in the long term. And they might well regain control of Congress at the first midterm. It's hard to win on a platform of process reform rather than substantive policy. It seems like people lack the attention span for it and/or an adequate understanding of the deficiencies that these reforms would seek to address. It would take an exceptionally skilled politician to pull it off on a partisan basis or to build the bipartisan consensus to de-politicize it.

As much as I think process reform is desperately needed, it seems like a distant pipe dream. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't talking about the Trump-Russia scandal with that last post. Gorsuch knew about what McConnell did to Garland.

Think about Gorsuch's stature if he declined the nomination publicly--maybe even at the press conference where Trump announced it. The media would have been fawning over him. 

Trump could of course withdraw his nomination instantly, but it would look terrible. Trump couldn't undo his prior lifetime appointment by Bush. So worst case, Gorsuch goes back to being possibly the most high-profile federal appellate judge in the country (who would likely get nominated to SCOTUS down the line). 

If, on the other hand, Gorsuch manages to persuade Trump to re-nominate Garland (which would have been a smart political move by Trump that would take a lot of steam ouf of the current legitimacy crisis), there'd be tremendous pressure to re-nominate Gorsuch for the next open seat or if the Garland nomination failed. Democrats would find it almost impossible to deny him an up or down vote after such a dramatic stand. Indeed, he might have won many of them over with it, and would take his seat on the Court as a consensus choice, with much more clout than he currently enjoys (he'd be the guy who stood up to Trump rather than having the highest achievement of his law career handed to him on a silver platter after being usurped from another deserving jurist). 

This type of legitimacy is vital for judges, who lack the power of the sword and purse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> CRA resolutions have effects beyond simply repealing the relevant regulations, though. They forbid future enactment of substantially similar rules (which is vague and raises potential constitutional issues when authority to enact regulations has been expressly delegated by specific statutory provisions that remain on the books). Also, they bypass the standard procedures for executive rule changes under the Administrative Procedure Act. These are fundamentally legislative actions, which would have no force without bicameral Congressional approval and a Presidential signature (or veto override).

Also, the resolutions of disapproval are expressly designated as [Public Laws](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/34/actions?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22privacy%22%5D%7D r=7).

<TEXT> The CRA itself just creates the *procedure* for passing Congressional resolutions of disapproval. It doesn't empower the President to invoke the statute unilaterally. Disapproving of a regulation requires specific legislative action by both the House and Senate, followed by a Presidential signature (or veto and potential override). That's essentially the same procedure for passing a bill into law. 

There are some constitutional issues that could be raised with the CRA. But it's impossible to argue that invocations of the CRA, which are initiated by Congress, are executive actions equivalent to executive orders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this sentimentwhich comes up in every Shareblue article that's posted on this subis pretty misguided. 

Shareblue has a [clearly disclosed partisan viewpoint](http://shareblue.com/company/):

Shareblue is an American media company. **We produce practical, factual content to** ***delegitimize Trumps presidency, embolden the opposition, and empower the majority of Americans to fight.***

There's nothing inherently wrong or unreliable with reporting factual information from a ***disclosed*** partisan perspective. For a good part of [our history, newspapers were explicitly partisan institutions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_American_newspapers). That's why you see some older ones with *Democrat* or *Republican* right in their name.

Shareblue is not pretending to be neutral. *And they're not neutral*. But they're not making shit up either. That's what distinguishes these stories from fake news and tinfoil conspiracy theory sites. 

As usual, here, they quote the relevant statement from Spicerthe official spokesman for the Trump Regimeprovide a direct link to the video, and then give their interpretation of it.

Since the primary source is provided, it's possible to watch it yourself to verify that Shareblue's quotation is accurate and not out of context. This permits you to draw your own conclusion, and ignore the partisan commentary if you wish.

Those items *can* fairly be called legislative. Though, as noted in the original post, every one of the items was negative--*i.e.*, a repeal of something rather than an affirmative accomplishment. 

Even if we're generous and call these items "legislative accomplishments," they weren't actually cited by Spicer (probably because they're incredibly unpopular with the public).

[Sen. Dean Heller faces angry constituents -- and demands for specifics -- at rowdy town hall](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/17/politics/dean-heller-town-hall-nevada/?sr=twCNN041817dean-heller-town-hall-nevada0716AMStoryVideo linkId=36606740).

Heller only won 45.9% of the vote in 2012, and NV has gone blue in three consecutive Presidential elections.

<TEXT> Can't take your eyes off the ball so easily, media:

President Donald Trump's missile strike on a Syrian regime-controlled airfield was presented to the public as an act of retaliation against President Bashar al-Assad for allegedly launching a chemical attack on the town of Khan Shaykhun.** Evidence from the last 12 days shows it has had no effect on the determination of Assad and his Russian ally, President Vladimir Putin, to bomb rebels in the area out of existence.** On the domestic front, however, it delivered a clear win for Trump.

...

...[S]ince Trump ordered the Tomahawk strike on Shayrat, **the major players in the Syrian conflict have gone about their business as if nothing had happened.** It's a relief that the action didn't lead to a direct clash between Russian and U.S. militaries -- but then, their priorities are still aligned on ISIS.

The Shayrat missile attack could be confidently written off as a relatively minor waste of U.S. resources and a major hot air eruption -- if its only effect were in Syria. Trump, however, is fighting a domestic political battle, too. **The Tomahawks have wreaked much more havoc in the U.S. media than in Shayrat, ruining the established narrative of Trump's alignment with Vladimir Putin.** Trump's son, Eric, has said the missile attack was proof that his father wasn't in league with Putin.

**If jaded U.S. pundits haven't quite adopted Eric Trump's view, headlines about Trump's alleged Russian ties have given way to analyses of his unpredictable flip-flops.** It has been noted that Trump is willing to go further to defend his "red lines" than Barack Obama was, and speculation has been rife that he's going to be more of a traditional Republican president than most people expected. His voter base is certainly worried that this might be the case.

**As one of Trump's habitual diversions, the Shayrat strike has succeeded brilliantly. Analysts are struggling to read Trump instead of mocking him**. He's getting praise from people who used to dismiss him, including some former Obama aides. And as for the voter base, there's plenty of time until the next election to worry about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, there's reason to be cautious, but it's not inherently implausible given the ~20-point swing toward Democrats observed in KS-04 and GA-06. 

If the poll cited in the article is indeed correct, there has been a 17-point net swing toward Julian Castro compared to [this August 17, 2016 PPP poll](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/ted-cruz/) which had Cruz beating Castro 48% to 36% in their hypothetical matchup. The same August PPP poll showed Cruz with 39% approval and 48% disapproval of his job performance (net -9). A 17-point swing toward Democrats is also pretty consistent with Trump's underwater 42%/54% (net -12) approval rating in the new Texas poll and the reality that this would be a midterm election, which the President's party almost always loses.

Finally, recall that Trump beat Clinton by 52.2% to 43.2%, which is a 6.8 point improvement from Romney's 57.2% to 41.4% victory over Obama. Texas isn't as red as it used to be when Cruz won his seat. Cruz won his election by 56.6% to 40.5%a 16.1% margin similar to Romney's 15.8%. He has had middling to low approval ratings throughout his term (creating speculation that he might even get a primary challenger) and is almost universally disliked on a personal level. Cruz is also only a first term incumbent, which is when incumbents are most vulnerable.

In light of all of this, Texas is arguably the most promising of the potential 3rd Senate seats (*i.e.*, after NV and AZ) that Democrats would need to flip in order to gain a 51-49 Senate majority in 2018.  It will be an uphill climb, to be sure.

<TEXT> No I don't, because brown is Obama's *actual* skin color as opposed to the phony hue that Trump's takes on after being drenched in chemical spray. 

Secondly, Brown One could have fairly clear racial connotations, whereas I intend Orange One only to poke fun at Trump's falsity. For this reason, I wouldn't ever call Trump the White One. Just as I wouldn't call an American Indian a Red One.

<TEXT> Republicans have held this seat continuously since they won it back in 1979, 38 years ago, at the midterm of Jimmy Carter's Presidency.

During that time, GA-06 has produced a Republican Speaker of the House (Newt Gingrich), the senior and currently-serving U.S. Senator from Georgia (Johnny Isakson), and the currently-serving Secretary of Health and Human Services (Tom Price). Calling it a Republican bastion is an understatement.

A 30-year-old political newcomer who's never held elected office nearly broke this streak *without the need for a runoff*. 

The Orange One's political toxicity made that possible.

The Republican Party can try to spin this any way they want. But if they're not concerned, they're deluded or foolish.  </TEXT>

Based on --

Jon Ossoff (Democratic) 	48.30%	90,732

Karen Handel (Republican) 	19.70%	36,944



-----------

**1)** Foremost, remember that GA-06 is Sec. Tom Price, Sen. Johnny Isakson and former Speaker Newt Gingrich's  district. **Price won it by 23.4% just 6 months ago. The 2017 PVI is R+8. The 2012 PVI was R+12.  Republicans have held this seat continuously since 1979.** 

***84 Republicans hold seats in districts as or more Republican than GA-06.***  

Let that sink in. 


The Orange One is so toxic that he's allowed a previously unknown 30-year-old Democrat, who's never held elective office, to basically erase Republican partisanship advantage in this formerly safe Republican district. *And he's still supposed to be in his honeymoon period.* It would have been nice to win today outright. But at leas now, Ossoff gets two more months of Trump's fuck-ups to run on (with Trump seizing every opportunity to nationalize the race and make a referendum on him). 

-----

**2)** It's nowhere near a foregone conclusion that Republicans will win the runoff. 

Using the projections from [this regression model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/handicapping-the-georgia-6-special-election/) incorporating data from 181 prior runoffs between Democrats and Republicans, we'd expect either:

***(a)*** **Runoff margin = .66 * Aggregate party margin + .22 * Top-two margin**


.66 * -1.78 + .22 * 28.6 = 5.12% -- **+5.1 D**

*or* 

***(b)*** **Runoff margin = .53 * Relative presidential margin (weighted 75:25 weighted average of 2016 and 2012 PVI) + .35 * Aggregate party margin + .19 * Top-two margin**

.53 * -10 + .35 * -1.78 +.19 * 28.6 = -0.49  -- **+.5 R**

(Subject to margins of error discussed in article). 

In other words, a slight D advantage to a true tossup. Not bad. I'll take those odds in what should be a safe, noncompetitive Republican seat. 

------
**3)** Let Republicans believe that the deal is sealed and that this dramatic 20+ point Democratic swing means nothing for 2018. They're more likely to be blindsided by the wave when it hits.

<TEXT> I get that people wanted to have something tangible to point to today, but this is an excellent result even if Ossoff ultimately falls just short of 50%. 

Ossoff is running ahead of Clinton in Fulton, DeKalb and Cobb counties (Clinton lost the district to Trump by 1.5%), and he's erased Tom Price's 23.4% margin over Rodney Stooksbury to make the runoff in this formerly safe Republican seat into a true tossup. 

There are 84 districts held by Republicans that are equally or less R-leaning than GA-06, based on [2017 PVI](http://cookpolitical.com/file/Arranged_by_PVI_rank.pdf). Democrats need to win just 24 of them (28.6%) for control of the House. 

If the GOP is holding on by the fingernails in GA-06 when November 2018 comes around, the House and possibly even the Senate will be long gone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a huge proponent of the 20-point swing. But I'm also not making that number up. A 20-point shift is approximately what it would take to unseat someone running just slightly less strongly than Price in GA-06. 

Keep in mind that it would only take about 7-8% of the electorate to switch sides plus a 5-6% enthusiasm gap to produce a 20-point swing.  

Remember that, prior to the Comey letter, [Democrats had been up in the generic congressional ballot](http://dyn.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2016_generic_congressional_vote-5279.html) by about 3.7 points according to the RCP average. They ended up by .6 after leading it all year--sometimes by up to 5-6 points. 

The GOP ended up winning the House popular vote by about 1.1%, basically at the nadir of the post-Comey swing. 

Now that temporary effect has worn off. So we might expect a return to more or less the baseline. 

Starting from there, add [Trump's historic unpopularity](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-beating-previous-presidents-at-being-unpopular/) and cloud of illegitimacy, and then pile the GOP Congress' inability to govern on top of that. When you do this, it's not so hard to see how you could get a 1994 or 2010 style midterm wave--or possibly something even greater.

There are fairly recent examples of a large swing that Trump could outdo under the right environment. 

For instance, in 2004, Republicans had won the popular vote for the House by 49.40% to the Democrats' 46.80%an R +2.6 margin. In that same election, Bush won 50.7% of the popular vote to Kerry's 48.8% (the only time in the last 7 Presidential elections that Republicans managed to win the popular vote). Post-election, Bush's approval stood at 55%. Anti-gay marriage initiatives passed in several states and were cited as a factor in his victory. Karl Rove was talking about a permanent Republican majority. (These were much stronger starting positions than Trump enjoyed immediately following his surprise Kremlin- and Comey-assisted victory.)

Yet, just two years later, in 2006, Democrats won the House popular vote by 52.30% (+5.5%) to 44.30% (-5.1%)a D +8.0 margin. **This is a 10.6% net swing.** At the time, Bush dropped to 38% approvaljust a bit lower than where Trump's average currently stands... during his honeymoon, right after its recent post-Syria-bombing rebound. 

Maybe we won't see a full 20-point swing.  And Democrats certainly don't need that large of a swing just to take control in 2018. But it wouldn't be the strangest thing if we did see it because of the uniquely anti-Trump/anti-GOP environment that this midterm may well present.

<TEXT> For one, there's incumbency. Tom Price won this seat 6 times. That's good for a few points at least. Then you have people's expectations. Given the gap between Price and Trump, there must have been a lot of ticket-splitting by people who voted for Clinton expecting her to win (and not wanting Trump) but presumably wanting a Republican to act as a check on her power.

Many of those people may now vote for a Democrat to check Trump's power. And they're super important, because by switching allegiances they create a 2-vote margin (they take one vote away from the Republican and give one vote to the Democrat). Because of this, Red to Blue defections are twice as powerful as turning out a new Democratic voter or a discouraged Republican voter staying home.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Price won his seat **61.7% to  38.3%a 23.4% R margin**. Trump carried the district **48.3% to 46.8%a 1.5% R margin**. According to the [recently released 2017 Cook PVI](http://cookpolitical.com/file/Arranged_by_PVI_rank.pdf), **GA-06 is R+8**, meaning the **GA-06 is 8 points more Republican than the country as a whole**.  

To give some idea of the significance of flipping this seat, by my count, **there are 84 seats held by a Republican in districts that are as or less Republican than GA-06 by PVI**. 

Alternatively, if you go by vote margin, and assume that there's a **+20 to +25 uniform shift toward Democrats from the 2016 election results** (which is what occurred in KS-04 and about what would be necessary for Ossoff to make up Price's margin), here are some simple projections of what the House might look like on the [**high**](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/2016_2_Houseb.jpg w=480) (**+105 Democratic seats**) and [**low**](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/2016_3_TC.jpg w=480) (**+72 Democratic seats**) end of this swing range. 

Thus, Ossoff flipping GA-06 could be the forerunner to a huge anti-GOP wave in 2018. And fear of that wave would likely start changing Republican behavior right now. So the importance of winning this seat can't be overstated.

People forget [how bad midterms can be for the President's Party](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/content/images/KDK2017033001-table1.png).

<TEXT> Interesting question.

I feel like we'll be at the point soon where many local and regional government processes may be able to be automated. Take filling pot holes. It's tedious, but (nearly) everyone agrees it should be done.
 
Assuming the necessary funds are there, it might make sense to put an AI in charge of identifying potholes, prioritizing them using various criteria (such as the potential to cause damage or disrupt traffic), scheduling repairs, dispatching repair drones and optimizing their routes, monitoring and re-ordering supplies, etc. Although humans are capable of doing each of these individual steps, we're not good at doing all of them together, in real time, using all the data available (*e.g.*, supply prices, traffic patterns, etc).  

Once people got comfortable with AI performing routine tasks like pothole-filling, they might be more open to it performing more critical tasks. This would be an iterative, bottom-up way to deploy AI. Consent could be obtained by having the AI itself run in the election (for maximum transparency, the platform could be the initial source code). Alternatively, we could elect a person to implement, maintain, and oversee the AI (this is probably makes more sense for  specialized, non-general AI).

After an AI were in place for a while and had been managing a process well, one could have a referendum to permanently automate it and transfer oversight authority to some higher bodylike a city mayor or planner, a county or city council, or a new public authority created specifically for the purpose of managing and overseeing automated government processes. As general AI gets more sophisticated and potentially even capable of recursive self-improvement, the management of automated government processes could be handed off to this second tier of AI using similar steps (*i.e.*, election of a human overseer or the AI itself).

<TEXT> You're correct that, in certain instances, you can owe negative taxes and get money back via a refundable credit even if you didn't pay/owe any federal income taxes. The most notable instance of this is the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC. You're also correct that there's no formal citizenship requirement for this credit (but that's normal, since legal permanent residents can get tax-funded public benefits that they also pay into.)

However, you *do* have to have a valid SSN in order to claim the EITC's refundable credit. Specifically, ff you pay federal taxes via an individual tax ID number, or ITIN, you aren't eligible for the credit. You also apparently cannot get the credit by filing or refiling your taxes retroactively after obtaining a valid SSN. 

Do you have any evidence that undocumented immigrants are benefiting from refundable tax credits like the EITC? Or were you reasoning to that conclusion by combining the premises that (1) refundable tax credits exist and (2) many unauthorized immigrants pay federal income taxes?

<TEXT> Looking at the plain meaning of a statute is a starting point. But it shouldn't be where the analysis ends, particularly when hyper-literalism produces an absurd result or there's ambiguity that can be resolved by looking at how a term is used in the overall statutory scheme and other indicia of legislative intent.

From the article:

Gorsuch's obsession with wording and the "plain text" of laws has led many to note his similarities with the man he is replacing, the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

Scalia was known for his adherence to textualism - a manner of interpreting laws in accordance with their plain text, rather than by assuming or inferring the intent of lawmakers, or the potential consequences of the laws' implementation.

While many of Gorsuch's rulings show he too is a clear adherent to textualism, perhaps nowhere is his dedication to unearthing the meaning of a law as "the words on the paper say" more noticeable than in one 2015 decision in which he used "plain old grade school grammar" to determine the legal penalties imposed on defendants accused of using a firearm "during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime."

In that 2015 decision, Gorsuch was ruling on a case in which prosecutors were attempting to charge a defendant, Philbert Rentz, with two violations for allegedly firing a gun once. Prosecutors argued that since a single shot hit and injured one person, then struck and killed another, two separate "crimes of violence" had been committed and should be penalized accordingly.

<TEXT> ... Donald Trump appears to have made a cynical calculation that he will not pay a high political price for being the most secretive president since Richard Nixon.

All the leaks about infighting among senior staff and the presidents proclivity for tweeting have created a false sense that the public knows what is happening inside his White House. In fact, the administration has gone to great lengths to conceal pertinent information from the American people.

After dodging questions on the subject for weeks, the administration waited until the afternoon of Good Friday to dump the news that it will not follow former president Barack Obama's policy of voluntarily disclosing the names of most visitors to the White House complex. The presidents communications director cited grave national security risks as a justification, even though Obama had made an exception for national security.

Then on Easter, Trump lashed out at the tens of thousands of protesters who marched in dozens of cities on Saturday to demand that he release his tax returns. ...

Despite constantly ripping Hillary Clinton for being secretive, Trump was consistently less transparent during the campaign. ...

Trump seems to feel that the results in November validated this obfuscation, and that takeaway has emboldened him to continue the same approach as much as possible.

<TEXT> Maybe China or Russia shared nuclear technology with NK. But it seems unlikely that they'd give them material assistance with an H-Bomb, such as sharing an actual functional design. If NK ultimately uses a thermonuclear weapon, whatever the context, they wouldn't want their fingerprints on it, because someone might hold them vicaeioualy responsible for NK's actions. Obtaining a design through espionage is also a possibility, but NK seems to isolated to successfully pull it off. I'm just speculating with this last point though. Maybe they could get their hands on a Chinese design or buy someone off in the US and Russia. They've been known to counterfeit $100 dollar bills. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They can probably miniturize a warhead to fit on a missile. But it's important to understand that it would likely be, *at most*, a boosted fission weapon with a max yield in the 60kt range. More likely, they can weaponize something in the 10kt range. That's about 1 Hiroshima bomb. Such an attack could kill 100,000-200,000+ people if launched at a densely-populated area. But it doesn't pose an existential threat to the US, Japan, or South Korea.

For comparison's sake, consider that each U.S. [*Ohio*-class ballistic missile sub](http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/slbm/ssbn-726.htm) can carry up to 24 Trident II missiles, all of which can be launched in less than a minute.  On depressed trajectories from about 1150 miles at sea, these missiles would reach NK in 7 minutes or so. So if a single *Ohio* were to unload on NK (not that this would necessarily be the retaliatory approach chosen), it could blanket NK with 336 independently targetable warheads (160 by treaty) for a total explosive power of 159.6 (63.4 treaty) megatons of TNT. For comparison, during *all of WW2* (1939-1945) the Allies collectively dropped a total of approximately 3.4 million tons (3.4 megatons) of bombsincluding the two nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

So in 8 minutes, a single sub could unleash anywhere between *about 18.5 and 47 times the destructive power of the entire WW2 Allied bombing campaign* on an area slightly larger than Pennsylvania. 

And the U.S. has 14 of these subs.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there's some sophistication to it, including in how radiation pressure is used to ignite and efficiently consume the fusion-fission secondary before the structure is blown apart by the primary as well as the building secondary explosionwhich can fizzle if everything's not right. Then, you have to miniaturize the physics package and ensure that it can cope with the forces it will be subjected to during its flight and re-entry before you can have a missile-deliverable weapon. 

NK may be able to pull it off eventually. After all, they don't have to prove that these weapons are viable, just develop and build a design that solves the practical problems (once they become fully aware of those problems). But my understanding is that it's currently beyond their technology. In fact, it's not even confirmed that Israel, India, or Pakistanfar more technologically advanced counties than NKactually have hydrogen bombs, and it's considered implausible that they might not. That's not to say that any of these counties couldn't develop an H-bomb, but it would require additional testing to troubleshoot the kinks.             </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article you cited states that, with the modifications, the NK test site itself *could withstand* up to a 282kt detonation. But it didn't say that the 6th test would actually produce this yield. My understanding is that NK likely couldn't get up into the ~300kt range without a Teller-Ulam fission-fusion-fission bomb. My further understanding is that they can probably weaponize a 10kt fission bomb, or possibly a [boosted fission bomb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosted_fission_weapon) in the 30-60kt range. Yet, they still lack the ability to build a *true* thermonuclear weapon capable of scaling abritrarily from hundreds of kilotons into the megaton range.

So, based on what we know, with the throw weight and volume that NK has to work with in a KN-14 ICBM, they might *conceivably* be able to develop a 60kt fission bomb and put it in a blunt re-entry vehicle that would be slow and vulnerable to interception by the the two final layers of the US ABM system (*i.e.*, GBI, THAAD, Pac-3).      </TEXT>

**On feminism and closing the pay gap:**

 What feminists don't realize is that bosses simply want to run a successful business. They will reward and promote whichever employees are doing the best job. If John sells more than Jill, he gets promoted; if Jill sells more than John, she gets promoted. That is the simple beauty of the free market. ([Sorry Feminists](http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2005/11/sorry-feminists), Nov. 22, 2005)

 It's vital to keep in mind what it would actually mean for women if we were to close the pay gap. For many, it would mean giving up a noble career in social working or putting in 50- and 60-hour work weeks and not being able to spend time with the family. It would mean trading in jobs like housekeeping for night shifts doing road repairs; it would mean giving up the joy of being home during your child's first years of life. (Ibid)

 It's not chauvinism. It's chivalry. (Ibid) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dunning-Kruger + Projection:

It is what we might call the consensus judgment that President Trump is a deeply ignorant man and perhaps a profoundly ignorant President. But it is worth stepping back and considering just what this means, the different kinds of ignorance that exist and how they differ.

...

**What is both ... terrifying and hilarious about Trump is not simply his ignorance, really his militant ignorance, but his complete lack of self-awareness about his ignorance.** Trump told a reporter for The Wall Street Journal that his understanding of the problem of North Korea changed dramatically after hearing ten minutes of history from the President of China. Needless to say, Trump didnt need to admit this. But neither was it candor.

So far the Trump Presidency has been a sort of Mr Magoo performance art in which the comically ignorant Trump learns elemental or basic things that virtually everyone in the world of politics or government already knew  things that the majority of adults probably know. Health Care: Nobody knew health care could be so complicated. North Korea: I felt pretty strongly that they had tremendous power. But its not what you think. There are perhaps half a dozen examples equally stark.

...

**What is key though is to understand that this is not just ignorance. Ignorance is just the first stage of Trumps fairly advanced problem. He is not only ignorant but clearly unaware of his level of ignorance. This is compounded by a seeming inability to understand that everyone elses isnt equally ignorant to him.** Those of us who are parents know the wonder of discovery experienced by small children. They find out there were things such as dinosaurs or close primate relatives called lemurs. As loving parents we indulge them, sometimes feigning ignorance of things we actually already knew to support a childs joy in discovery.

But Donald Trump is a 70 year old man. And not a terribly nice man.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comey sought to *appear* impartial, was still attacked for bias despite his efforts, and gave significant ammo to the GOP to use against Clinton with both his press conference and the vague letter. The public interest in the integrity of an election free from interference outweighs Comey's interest in his own reputation. Likewise, basic fairness requires investigators to shield information obtained through their broad and coercive investigative powers from disclosure if there's insufficient evidence to indict. Comey should have been prepared to take criticism for his decision. He's not an elected official in part so that he can do just that. 

[From the Rolling Stone piece I cited above](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-the-fbis-james-comey-fumbled-the-clinton-email-probe-w447597):

**His July press conference was highly unusual; as Comey himself noted, the Department of Justice usually refuses to comment on ongoing cases**. But he said he felt it was necessary to speak in detail, directly to the American people, because they "deserve those details in a case of intense public interest."

**Comey bent over backwards in an effort to appear transparent and avoid any whiff of impropriety. Nonetheless, Republicans swiftly condemned him**. He was dragged before Congress three times to reiterate his judgement that Clinton should not be prosecuted. His skewering continued unabated, to the point that he angrily lashed out at a September hearing. "You can call us wrong, but don't call us weasels," Comey told the House Judiciary Committee. "We are not weasels."

**All these failed attempts to appear impartial created the conditions for the firestorm that erupted on Friday**, when Comey  again, in the service of transparency  sent a letter to the the same group of Congress members he'd previously testified before, informing them that he had recently "learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the Clinton investigation."

Comey has not commented publicly on the situation since sending the letter Friday. But, as he made clear in an internal memo dispatched over the weekend, **he was chiefly concerned about appearances.**

"[W]e don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed," Comey wrote.

**What he probably should have been concerned about, though, was that he might suggest wrongdoing by Clinton in the total absence of  by his own admission  any evidence at all that she's done anything wrong.**

"[G]iven that we don't know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don't want to create a misleading impression," Comey wrote. It's worth reiterating that last point: **Comey had (and still has) no idea what the emails found on the laptop were, or how they got there**. The FBI doesn't know whether the emails are duplicates of ones that have already been turned over to them. They don't know who sent them, and they don't, in any event, suspect it was Hillary Clinton  the subject of the investigation Comey testified about and the person for whom this information will inflict the most damage.

**Comey concluded by acknowledging that many voters could read something truly damning into his purposely vague letter.** "In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and **in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood**, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it."

**But he cared less about that than he did about the impression his congressional antagonists might have of him**. And in doing so, Comey has earned the one thing he appears to have been trying to avoid: widespread condemnation, from all corners.

<TEXT> Maybe not WW3, but a theater nuclear war. 

We strike the test site and North Korea's nuclear reactors. NK responds with an artillery barrage on Seoul and along the DMZ. 

Tens or hundreds of thousands are killed.  Intense fighting erupts along the DMZ (if it already hasn't), with US troops already stationed in SK sucked into the mix, possibly demanding futher deployments in support.  South Korea and the US attack Pyongyang with airstrikes and possibly a full-on invasion.  The Kim Regime believes (correctly) that its existence is threatened and attacks South Korea and Japan with ballistic missiles for fear of losing them. Those or possibly an NK airstrike delivers a nuclear attack as well as chemical agents like VX or Sarin. 

The U.S. retaliates against the NK WMD sites and leadership with a nuclear attack from a Trident sub parked offshore. Anywhere from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions are killed instantaneously in the initial and retaliatory nuclear exchanges and their aftermath. 

The Kim Regime is obliterated. But fallout affects the entire region, which combined with the effects of the devastating damage on the most densely populated and economically important region in South Korea (and possibly Japan), plunges the world into a severe recession.

From there, it's hard to predict what the recession, war, and instability might trigger. 

China and/or other countries could potentially impose sanctions on the U.S. for sparking the conflict and using nuclear weapons. There might be a worldwide boycott of U.S. goods. The U.S. could retaliate by raising tarriffs, choking off trade and worsening the recession into a depression. 

Similarly, Japan and SK could potentially withdraw from their alliances with the U.S. and/or announce that they will develop their own nuclear deterrents. China would presumably respond by building up its own nuclear and conventional forces, triggering a regional arms race. China might also see the opportunity in this moment of U.S. weakness to re-take Taiwan. If the U.S. responded and China didn't back down we could get WW3 right there. Or else, maybe Putin decides to make a move in Eastern Europe as the U.S. is stretched and distracted. That could trigger the U.S.' NATO commitments and also potentially lead to WW3. 

Who knows?

A better question would be: why are we even considering opening this can of worms?

Between 1999 and 2004, Dearlove was head of the Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, a tenure that included the bruising experience of the Iraq war, the drama of 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan. He joined the service in 1966 and in his time he ran MI6s Washington station, the most significant posting in British intelligence and was also overall Director of Operations.

So hes seen it all before. But the allegations that members of Trumps staff had illegal contact with the Russian government during the election campaign are unprecedented, said Dearlove. As for the presidents personal position, he said, **What lingers for Trump may be what dealson what termshe did after the financial crisis of 2008 to borrow Russian money when others in the west apparently would not lend to him.** I also asked Dearlove about Trumps suggestion that the US National Security Agency (NSA) or British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) had bugged Trump Tower on the instructions of Barack Obama. This allegation was flatly rejected by both organisations and also by James Comey, Director of the FBI, who told Congress in a March hearing that we have no information to support Trumps claim. This is simply deeply embarrassing, said Dearlove, for Trump and the administration, that is. The only possible explanation is that Trump started tweeting without understanding how the NSA-GCHQ relationship actually works.

With that said, Dearlove does not appear to be claiming that he has any specific evidence of the deals, and he hasn't been the head of MI6 for 12 years.

<TEXT> People could of course allege it was a cover up. And some would believe it. But you'd also have the evidence that the FBI (presumably the fired agents) held off on briefing him to make the revelation more politically damaging. He could still conduct the review, but without the ambiguous letter that permitted Trump to campaign on the worst possible interpretation. When the review confirmed that laptop emails was mostly duplicates and he revealed it, the story would have been a lot less damaging. In the meantime, the story wouldn't be "re-opening the Clinton email investigation" but "pro-Trump mutiny at the FBI to damage Clinton."

In any event, not conducting a preliminary review and sending the letter without knowing what was in the emails was improper. He should have been able to control his people long enough to do that. And if not, that itself is a significant failing.

<TEXT> There's a key distinction here.

 **Republicans are in the majority** now and when they held the continuing resolutions and debt ceiling hostage to win concessions. (The brinkmanship with raising the debt ceiling and pay for spending that was already authorized was especially eggregious.) **Democrats, as the minority and opposition, have no obligation to help the Republican Party govern**especially not in ways they disagree with, under explicit threat of Trump sabotaging healthcare for millions of people.

Here, Republicans would be coming to Democrats for help to pass a budget because the Freedom Caucus is too extreme and the GOP doesn't have enough votes without them. So Republicans should expect to make genuine concessions to Democratic priorities. They have to convince Democrats that what they're proposing is worth supporting. If they can't, the voters can elect a majority that is capable of governing in 2018.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> After Comeys October surprise, Clintons popular-vote lead over Donald Trump in the polls dropped from 6 points to 3, according to FiveThirtyEight.Republicans grabbed some spiked bats and joined the Comey beatdown. Without additional context, your disclosure is not fair to Congress, the American people, or Secretary Clinton, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa wrote in a letter to Comey on October 31. Look, I think Comey should have said prosecute her back in July. But what he just did 11 days b4 the election is wrong   unfair to Hillary, tweeted Joe Walsh, a conservative talk show radio host and former Illinois congressman. Republican former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told CNN that Comey had made an error in judgment, adding: You dont comment on investigations because commenting on the investigation may jeopardize the investigation.

Comey seemed to have pulled off the rarest of feats in politics: He pissed off everybody. Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom said on Fox News that Comeys decision was nonsensical, adding: Its not Comeys right to sully that reputation [of the FBI].

The way the letter was written was incredibly vague and careless, a Democratic operative tells Newsweek. That was a massive hand grenade thrown into the middle of an election that was 11 days away. In addition to energizing Trump supporters, Comeys decision to publicize a tiny advance in a completed investigation angered Democrats because it came while Comey was keeping silent about reports of Russian interference in the election and possible collusion by members of the Trump campaign. In fact, CNBC reported that Comey had declined to sign an October 7 joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that accused the Russian government of tampering with the U.S. election, because he thought it was too close to when people would cast their votes.

Two days before the election, Comey told lawmakers the bureau had reviewed the new emails and found no reason to change its decision that Clinton should not face chargesbut that was like waving a white paper napkin to stop a tornado. Newsweeks Kurt Eichenwald wrote, America has just witnessed one of the mostif not the mostegregious abuses of power in the service of one mans ego in its history. When Clinton lost to Donald Trump, the fury swelled. She blamed the FBI director for contributing to her defeat and The Wall Street Journal called for his resignation.

...

Last July, Comey took the unusual step of holding a press conference to announce that the FBI would not be recommending charges to the U.S. Department of Justice over her use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. But instead of fully exonerating the Democrats presidential candidate, he scolded her and said his agents had found top-secret and classified email chains on her servers. Then, on October 28, 11 days before the election, Comey wrote to Congress saying the FBI had found new emails related to the case. Clinton has said the letter had a determinative effect on the election, and critics excoriated him as a self-righteous egomaniac with political motives.

...

Comeys supporters say he remains confident that the decisions hes made have been the correct ones, even those so controversial they have earned him enemies and a review by the Justice Departments Office of the Inspector General. Kelley, the longtime friend who is in regular contact with Comey, says, Hes somebody who does what he thinks is the right thing to do and isnt one who is going to yield on that based on what criticism he might get. Comey said something similar onstage at an intelligence industry event recently: I know that when I make a hard decision, a storms going to follow, but honestly, I dont care.

If the inspector general finds that Comey mishandled the Clinton email investigation, Trump could have an excuse to remove Comey, possibly before the FBIs Russia investigation is finished. On April 12, Trump told Fox Business Network that its not too late to ask Comey to step down, adding, But, you know, I have confidence in him. Well see what happens. Its going to be interesting. Steinbach says Comey isnt concerned about job security: Hes very comfortable. Hes grounded in his family. Hes got a strong sense of beliefs. Hes going to do what he believes is the right thing to do for the country, for the FBI. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Democrats are signaling theyre ready to up the ante after President Donald Trump threatened to end certain Obamacare subsidies  and risk a collapse of the individual market  in a push to make the subsidies a major issue in ongoing government funding negotiations.

Congressional Democrats will seek to create a permanent funding mechanism for the insurer subsidies, which are currently the target of a House GOP lawsuit that claims the payments are illegal because they were not explicitly appropriated by Congress.

The potential showdown over funding the government comes after Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he was considering shutting off the billions of dollars in payments to force Democrats to play along with his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

The Presidents comments on stopping the Cost Sharing Reduction payments will increase costs, is a threat to the good health of the American people and a threat to keeping government open, an aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told TPM Thursday in an email.

...

A Democratic Senate aide said in an email that Trumps Wall Street Journal comments put the subsidies front and center of what Democrats will fight for while hammering out with Republicans a deal that will seek to thwart a government shutdown in the weeks to come.

...

The payments subsidize insurers for keeping out-of-pocket costs down for low income consumers, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act. If the payments are halted, its anticipated that insurers would raise their premiums by an estimated 19 percent or exit the individual market entirely.

In addition to the larger market ramifications, some 7 million consumers benefit from the subsidies.

...

This cynical strategy will fail, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in a statement. Our position remains unchanged: drop repeal, stop undermining our health care system, and we will certainly sit down and talk about ways to improve the Affordable Care Act.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction for the Affordable Care Act, said in a statement that Democrats will not negotiate with hostage takers.

There is no outcome in which the administration sabotaging insurance markets persuades Democrats to pass Trumpcare, a disastrous proposal which would only make our health care system worse, Wyden said.

Trump, in seeking to use the payments as leverage, finds himself lined up against not only Democrats, but major health care industry groups, and even the Chamber of Commerce, which joined a letter to Trump earlier this week calling for the subsidies to be preserved.

<TEXT> The Rolling Stone piece below, from October 31, explains it well and holds up several months afterward. It's worth reading in its entirety.

Comey's July 5 press conference had nothing to do with Lynch. Rather, Comey was trying to avoid criticism from Republicans in announcing his decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution based on the private email server.

The investigative file and report would ordinarily provide sufficient justification for that decision. At his discretion, Comey took the extraordinary step of discussing the investigation publicly. There are strong norms (and in some cases explicit rules) against that precisely in order to avoid creating the appearance of impropriety even if a decision is made not to press chargesa power with a strong potential for abuse.

[How the FBI's James Comey Fumbled the Clinton Email Investigation]
(http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-the-fbis-james-comey-fumbled-the-clinton-email-probe-w447597):

His July press conference was highly unusual; as Comey himself noted, the Department of Justice usually refuses to comment on ongoing cases. But he said he felt it was necessary to speak in detail, directly to the American people, because they "deserve those details in a case of intense public interest."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right. 

He could have publicly fired and censured the people who were purportedly trying to force his hand. If they leaked the laptop email story, he could then have, among other things, publicly disclosed that the FBI knew about the laptop emails for 3 weeks before briefing him, but didn't even seek a warrant during that time. That would clearly justify Comey being cautious to avoid the risk of interfering in the election. He *chose* to send a vague letter (that he knew would leak and be misunderstood) without first doing even a preliminary review of the laptop emailsthe overwhelming majority of which were duplicates of emails that had already been carefully reviewed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Couldn't disagree more. 

The July press conference itself was totally improper. Comey's an *investigator*, not a *prosecutor*. If he hadn't editorialized, but simply declined to refer the investigation  to the DoJ for prosecution, he wouldn't have put himself in the position of giving testimony to Congress and then having to supplement it (at his discretion, despite contrary DoJ policies), with the infamous letter 11 days from the election. Don't forget that when he sent the letter, the FBI had already known about the laptop emails for 3 weeks but hadn't even sought a warrant to review them.

Analysis of polling and other data strongly suggests that Comey's letter to Chaffetz*by itself*swung the election to Trump. Comey's internal letter showed that he knew that it would leak and be misunderstood by the public (fact he's now conveniently lamenting). But despite this risk, he sent the letter anyway. *Three weeks earlier*, knowing full-well that Russia was interfering in the election, he refused to sign the FBI onto an October 7 statement from DHS and the ODNI attributing responsibility for the hacks to Russia. 

His rationale? *It was too close to the election.* Afterward, the Trump campaign used the FBI's refusal to endorse the October 7 statement as a way question the validity and credibility of the statement. Yet, Comey stood by and did nothing. He could just have said, "actually, we agree with this."

Now, Comey claims he will do *everything* to warn the public of election interference?

Please. You're a little late.

<TEXT> Yeah, and there's a good chance that they'll be blindsided by the building anti-GOP wave because of it.

*First*, it's important to remember that the President's party almost always loses seats (or a share of the House, when it was still growing) in the midterm. In 39 midterms since 1862, there are only 3 exceptions to this rule, each presenting unusual circumstances: 1934, 1998, and 2002. 

*Second*, beyond this basic midterm pattern, Republicans also seem to have forgotten that [the President's party tends to get decimated in Congress and at the state level after 8 years of holding the White House](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/content/images/KDK2016111701-table5.png). Any analysis concerning the state of the post-Obama Democratic Party should factor this important long-term pattern before drawing sweeping conclusions. 

With the Democrats' cycle of holding the White House now complete, the political pendulum appears to be jerking rapidly back to the left rather than experiencing a more gradual swing like it usually does. 

The speed of this leftward backswing probably reflects the unusual nature of Trump's election as well as the weakness of his initial mandate. Never forget that Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million, and he was on track to lose it by even more (along with the electoral vote) until Comey yanked the football away 11 days from the election while people were already voting. Before that, the Podesta and DNC Wikileaks dumps dominated media and social network discussion of Clinton, depressing her favorability numbers and limiting coverage of her issue positions (even though she was leading by about 6-7 points before the Comey letter).  

Since then, the FBI investigation announced in Comey's letter has turned out to be a big nothingburger, and the Wikileaks dumps have been exposed as part of a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign to help Trump win. So we'd expect a return to the baseline level of Democratic support as the Comey and Wikileaks effects wane. 

On top of this reversion to the baseline, there's also the affirmative damage inflicted by the alleged *quid pro quo* and direct coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. This is a historic scandal and legitimacy crisis that could derail *any* administration. But instead of collecting accomplishments, the Trump Regime has been pouring gasoline onto the raging dumpster firewith its decision to push a hard right agenda without making even token efforts to reach out to the opposition, controversial executive appointments, blatant conflicts of interest, pathological lying and war with the media, historic understaffing, constant infighting and leaking, and shocking ineptitude at basic governance.

The result is an early and rapid erosion of public support that's *unpresidented* in the history of American political polling. Strong GOP partisans are less likely to accurately perceive and interpret this errosion because they're seeing the Trump Regime through red-tinted glasses and judging it against an alternate universe of facts.

*Third and finally*, Republicans may be over-estimating their structural advantage from gerrymandering and making faulty inferences about what that advantage means. They appear to take the success of their gerrymandering efforts as proof of a popular mandate for GOP policies. Yet, polls actually show that signature Republican policieslike repealing and replacing the ACA, tax cuts for the rich, and removing environmental protectionsare highly unpopular. The exaggerated GOP majority in the House just shows that Republicans are good at gaming the electoral system. This is dangerous for them because if the swing we just saw in KS-04namely, a +20 to +25 shift toward Democrats (depending on your assumptions about incumbency advantage)were to happen nationally, gerrymandering will actually start to backfire and take out a disproportionate number of GOP incumbents.

Take a look at these simple projections of what the House might look like on the [high](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/2016_2_Houseb.jpg w=480) and [low](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/2016_3_TC.jpg w=480) end of this swing. The relatively steep (inelastic) region likely shows the gerrymandering advantage whereas the relatively flat (elastic) region shows where small changes in the vote will take out a large number of GOP incumbents.

----

**Washington Post:**
[Why would Assad use sarin in a war hes winning? To terrify Syrians](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/04/11/why-would-assad-use-sarin-in-a-war-hes-winning-to-terrify-syrians/?utm_term=.ab7817b8b2a6).

and 

**New York Times:** [The Grim Logic Behind Syrias Chemical Weapons Attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.html)

and

**The Guardian:** [Syria nerve agent attack: why it made sense to Assad](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/07/syria-nerve-agent-attack-why-it-made-sense-to-assad)

----------------

Although it appears that Assad didn't use chemical weapons purely out of military necessity, there are several reasons why such weapons could be seen as useful if he misperceived or miscalculated what the American response would be. Assad didn't know that there would *necessarily* be retaliation for the Idlib attack. He could have thought that he could get away with using nerve gas in light of the Trump Regime's apparent abandonment of the US policy to pursue regime change in Syria, or because Congress previously blocked President Obama's request for authorization to conduct a retaliatory strike when Assad used nerve gas in Ghouta in 2013.

These weren't totally unreasonable assumptions on his part.

Recall that, just a little over a week ago, people like Tillerson and Spicer were publicly signalling that the U.S. would acquiesce to Assad remaining in power, which the New York Times characterized as a "remarkable reversal of American foreign policy...[b]y any measure." *See* [White House Accepts Political Reality of Assads Grip on Power in Syria](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/us/politics/trump-bashar-assad-syria.html?_r=0 referer=https://mobile-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.amp.html?amp_js_v=9) (March 31, 2017):

President Trump has abandoned the goal of pressing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to leave power, marking a sharp departure from the Middle East policy that guided the Obama administration for more tha
n five years, the White House said on Friday.

With respect to Assad, there is a political reality that we have to accept, said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.

The United States has profound priorities in Syria and Iraq, and weve made it clear that counterterrorism, particularly the defeat of ISIS, is foremost among those priorities, he added, using the acronym for the Islamic State.

In a sense, Mr. Spicers comments  and similar comments on Thursday by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations  have merely made explicit an assumption that has guided the Trump administrations policy toward the region in recent months.


According to the New York times piece linked above, Assad has been pursuing a strategy to demoralize the opposition by conducting ruthless attacks on civilians in rebel-held areas. You can't really run a long-term insurgency without popular support. Civilian populations are less mobile and equipped to resist a chemical attack than armed rebels, so they're an easy target. To the extent the rebels are hidden and conducting guerrilla warfare, a government can punish the population they're hiding among in order to undermine the viability of the insurgency. As we've seen from the horrifying images out of Idlib, nerve gas can be a highly effective weapon of terror. If "rebellions are built on hope," Assad's goal with the attacks is killing hope. Showing that he can get away with them without any consequences from the international community might even have been part of his calculus.

<TEXT> Seems like this was discovered by a review of previously-collected SIGINT:

**The US military and intelligence community has intercepted communications featuring Syrian military and chemical experts talking about preparations for the sarin attack in Idlib last week, a senior US official tells CNN.**

**The intercepts were part of an immediate review of all intelligence in the hours after the attack to confirm responsibility for the use of chemical weapons in an attack in northwestern Syria**, which killed at least 70 people. **US officials have said that there is "no doubt" that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is responsible for the attack.**

**The US did not know prior to the attack it was going to happen, the official emphasized.** The US scoops up such a large volume of communications intercepts in areas like Syria and Iraq, the material often is not processed unless there is a particular event that requires analysts to go back and look for supporting intelligence material.

...

So far there are no intelligence intercepts that have been found directly confirming that Russian military or intelligence officials communicated about the attack. The official said the likelihood is the Russians are more careful in their communications to avoid being intercepted.

...

For now, the official said the most specific evidence of Russian involvement remains a Russian drone that flew over the hospital that was treating people injured in the attack. The US has specific intelligence showing it was a Russian drone. While the drone operator may not have known why the aerial vehicle was flying in the area, it was a Russian-controlled asset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. Seeing roughly the same amount show up in multiple places raises serious suspicions. 

"Following the money" means looking at what was exchanged at each stage, who benefited and who paid, and laying it out on a chronological timeline. And, if companies were involved, you always have to figure out who owned them, who was associated with them or with their owners, as well as what assets the companies held and disposed of. As you do this, the nominal form and false characterizations of various transactions tend to fall away and reveal the substance of what *actually* happened.

<TEXT> ...Dogged by revelations about past financial dealings in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort retreated from public view.

But behind the scenes, he was busy with other matters. Papers were recorded that same day creating a shell company controlled by Mr. Manafort that soon received $13 million in loans from two businesses with ties to Mr. Trump, including one that partners with a Ukrainian-born billionaire and another led by a Trump economic adviser. They were among $20 million in loans secured by properties belonging to Mr. Manafort and his wife.

The purpose of the loans is unstated in public records, although at least some of them appear to be part of an effort by Mr. Manafort to stave off a personal financial crisis stemming from failed investments with his son-in-law.

They also shine a light on the rich real estate portfolio that Mr. Manafort acquired during and after the years he worked in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort, often using shell companies, invested millions of dollars in various properties, including apartments and condos in New York, homes in Florida and Virginia and luxury houses in Los Angeles.

...

The source of the money for the real estate purchases is not clear, and Mr. Manafort never filed lobbying registrations for his work in Ukraine that would have disclosed his compensation. Such registrations are necesssary for activities that involve influencing policy and public opinion in the United States, and some of Mr. Manaforts Ukraine work appeared to fall into that category. Anti-corruption officials in Ukraine say $12.7 million in off the books cash payments were earmarked for him in a handwritten ledger kept by the political party of the deposed strongman Viktor F. Yanukovych. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shareblue has a [clearly disclosed partisan viewpoint](http://shareblue.com/company/):

Shareblue is an American media company. **We produce practical, factual content to** ***delegitimize Trumps presidency, embolden the opposition, and empower the majority of Americans to fight.***

They're not pretending to be neutral. And they're not. But they're not making shit up either. That's what distinguishes this from fake news. 

Here, they quote the relevant statement from Trump, provide a direct link to a video, and give their interpretation of it. 

I'd add that I don't find their interpretation to be off the wall. Trump's statement does read like a thinly-veiled threat (especially since Trump actually [seems to believe to this day that Comey *helped Clinton*](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-comey-clinton-bartiromo-interview-2017-4)):

BARTIROMO: scratching their heads why so many Obama-era staffers are still here. For example, **was it a mistake not to ask Jim Comey to step down from the FBI at the outset of your presidency? Is it too late now to ask him to step down?**

TRUMP: **No, its not too late. But**, you know, **I have confidence in him. We will see what happens**. You know, **its going to be interesting.**

If you *do* interpret this as a thinly-veiled threat, it's not unfair to characterize it as a threat in the headline. 

Maybe it wasn't intended as a threat? You could also read this as an impulsive and badly-worded statement by Trumpeven if it's less plausible. But the thing people don't seem to get is it's not a Democratic news source's job to help the Trump Regime by giving him the benefit of the doubt. It's on him to speak more carefully and be less belligerent if he doesn't want his ambiguous statements to be construed negatively.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even with gerrymandering, talk of retaking the House was never crazy. Democrats have a 24-seat deficit (22 if they win these special elections), and the average midterm loss for the president's party is over 30 seats. The president's party has lost seats or a share of Congress (when the House was growing) in 36 out of 39 midterm elections starting with 1862. In 2006, with Bush at 38% approval, Democrats took 30 seats in the House and 6 in the Senate to flip control of both chambers.

The Senate is harder in 2018 but could well be in play in a wave like 2010 or 1994. Democrats will have to defend their incumbents and take Arizona and Nevada. That would leave them one seat short because of Pence's tie-breaking vote. For outright control, they will need to unseat Cruz in Texas. That's not impossible. He's unpopular, widely disliked, a first-term incumbent, and people have been talking about Texas turning purple for a long time.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> [T]hese are both districts that have given GOP presidential candidates 60-plus percent of the vote in recent years.

Democratic wins in either wouldn't be unprecedented. Massachusetts had just given Barack Obama 62 percent of the vote before Brown won it in 2010, and Mississippi's 1st District also gave George W. Bush 62 percent before Democrats picked it off in 2008. (The Louisiana seat went 59 percent for Bush.)

But these special elections were shocking upsets that preceded wave elections for the victorious parties. The fact that Democrats couldn't defend the bastion of liberalism that was Massachusetts in 2010 and that the GOP couldn't hold conservative districts in the Deep South in 2008 presaged very bad things for the party in power.

In Georgia and Kansas, we have some pretty similar circumstances. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assad didn't use chemical weapons purely out of military necessity, but that doesn't mean there was no reason for him to do this. He's been pursuing a [strategy to demoralize the opposition by conducting ruthless attacks on civilians in rebel-held areas](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.html), and showing that he can get away with these attacks without any consequences from the international community. If "rebellions are built on hope," he's killing hope.

Nerve gasas we've seen from the horrifying images out of Idlibcan be a highly effective weapon of terror. Assad also didn't know that there would necessarily be a retaliation. He could have thought, in light of the Trump Regime's apparent abandonment of the US policy to pursue regime change in Syria, and Congress having blocked President Obama's prior request for authorization to conduct a retaliatory strike when Assad used nerve gas in Ghouta in 2013, that he could get away with using it again. 

If you distrust the reporting from all the reputable mainstream outlets and news wires attributing this to Assad, there's also very good open-source investigative journalism refuting the Russian cover story:

Suppose you think Trump is worse than Clinton on the issue of Syria. You wouldn't be thankful Clinton is not President because you'd consider what she would likely have done to be a better outcome. 

On the other hand, if you were totally indifferent between Clinton and Trump's positions on this issue, it also wouldn't make sense to be thankful, since you're getting something that you considered just as bad under Trump. 

Thus, logically, thankfulness must imply *at least* a slight preference for *at least some aspect* of what Trump has done as compared to what Clinton would likely have done.

<TEXT> It depends what you mean by this going down.

Clinton *was* in favor of a coherent overall approach to the Syria problem, which included no-fly zones and ground safe zones enforced by an international coalition, as well as increased diplomatic pressure on Russia for.supporting Assad. She backed Obama's plan to conduct air strikes *with Congressional authorization* back in 2013 to retaliate for Assad's earlier sarin attack in Ghouta.

I agree that there would have been a retaliatory response to the Idlib gas attack under Clintonassuming that attack had still happened. We don't know whether the air and ground exclusion zones would have already been in place or whether they'd have been effective. Similarly, we don't know whether Assad would have conducted the attack if the Trump Regime hadn't been [signalling, not a week before the attack took place, that they were OK with him staying in power](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/64dgcr/z/dg1dkj6).

But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that the Idlib attack happened exactly as under Trump, I think we'd have seen personal criticism by Clinton of Putin for his support for Assad. A call for tightening sanctions, and probably a request for Congressional authorization to conduct coalition strikes on Assad's airfields used to attack civilians. Even if the strike were limited to the Shayrat airfield. I think we'd have seen the sarin itself destroyed, and the runway targetted so that there wouldn't be planes taking off some 12 hours later.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're shifting the goalposts. In your original comment, you said that we should be thankful Trump is President because if Clinton were, we'd already be at war with Russia. That's an outrageous and completely unsupported claim. 

Even if we accept the goalpost-shifting, Clinton didn't call for massive strikes in Syria. [Her website is still up](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factchecks/2016/01/17/the-truth-about-clintons-record-in-syria/). Check it. She actually thought about these issues during the campaign and provided her positions. Her transparent and specifix outlined proposal makes a lot more sense than what we've done so far or the muddied and equivocal message we're now sending. We still don't know what the Trump Regime's position is.

In essence, if you look at the outline on her campaign site, Clinton favored a multilateral approach including no-fly zones and safe zones on the ground enforced by an international coalition, as well as increased support for Assad's opponents and increased diplomatic pressure on Russia. She did not want WW3. You're repeating a Kremlin-sponsored talking pointI presume unintentionally.

Why would we thank having a hot-tempered know-nothing narcissist with the attention span of a gnat making decisions and managing the situation instead of someone who understands the complexity of the world and had actually thought in a rigorous way about the Syria problem *before* the current crisis arose? Sorry, but there's nothing to be thankful about here.

For all the talk of Clinton's hawkishness, here we are, on the brink of another Middle Eastern (or worse) war under the candidate who was supposedly going to prevent it with a singular focus on "America First."

<TEXT> Some solid game theoretic strategic analysis in this article:

However justified and morally satisfying, any use of military force is serious business, and even those limited strikes could lead the United States and Russia down an escalatory path.

...

If the United States goes down this road, the prospects of a military confrontation with Moscow are real. A few thousand Russian military personnel are distributed across Syrias key military bases. Moscow has also placed some of the worlds most sophisticated air defense systems in Syria, and Russian planes police Syrian skies. So an extensive U.S. campaign aimed at coercing Assad by targeting Syrian air bases and command-and-control facilities would run big risks of killing Russian troops on the ground. The same holds for a no-fly zone, which would likely require targeting Syrian and Russian air defenses and could lead to air-to-air incidents between Russian and U.S. jets. Under any of these circumstances, the prospect of spiraling conflict is enhanced by Moscows decision to suspend the deconfliction channel between the Russian and U.S. militaries.

Compounding matters, in an effort to generate counter-leverage, Russia and the Assad regime are likely to respond to further U.S. strikes or a no-fly zone by reorienting their integrated air defense network toward U.S. and coalition aircraft engaged in fighting the Islamic State or by attacking opposition areas in northern Syria, where nearly 1,000 U.S. troops are on the ground. This could derail the counter-Islamic State campaign at the very moment when the militant groups capital, Raqqa, is under assault by U.S.-backed forces. And it could put the lives of American service members in jeopardy.

**There are also significant escalation risks even if the Trump administration** doesnt go down this path and **sticks to the narrower stated objective of deterring further chemical attacks.**

According to news reports, before the strikes, Trump was briefed on options to retaliate against Assad. One was to launch saturation strikes aimed at dozens of Syrian airfields and facilities, with the goal of destroying Assads ability to use his air force to carry out further chemical attacks. (This option was similar to the one reportedly contemplated by President Barack Obama in 2013.)


At the urging of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Trump rejected this option in favor of cruise missile strikes against a single air base. This option was reportedly viewed as proportional and much less likely to kill Russian soldiers. (Although around 100 Russian troops were reportedly stationed at Shayrat, the administration warned Moscow ahead of time, and the missiles struck the portion of the airfield away from Russian barracks.)

In other words, **Trump chose a limited strike package precisely because he and his advisers understood the grave risks if the United States attacked a broader set of targets.**

**But therein lies a major dilemma for Trump moving forward. Successful deterrence requires a credible threat to hit Assads forces again if the regime continues to use chemical weapons or commits other transgressions**. Yet Trump, **having already rejected a larger military response** out of apparent recognition of the dangers, may find it **difficult to credibly signal he is willing to deploy this option in response to further actions by Assad down the line.**

***In this context, the danger of miscalculation is real.*** **The Syrian dictator (perhaps prodded by Russia or Iran) may attempt to test Trump again, hoping to prove the president is a paper tiger. And Trump, having invested his personal credibility in standing firm, may find himself psychologically or politically compelled to respond, despite the very real risks that it could result in a direct military clash with Russia.**    </TEXT>

The previous record, held by Justice Harlan's successful confirmation, was 127 days.

Might have been worth a try, but there'd be no guarantee of success and it would be incredibly divisive. Obama could've also tried a recess appointment between the 114th and 115th Congress (that would only last a year though and then Trump would get to fill Garland's seat on the DC Circuit). Most controversially, there was an idea to confirm Garland on January 3rd before the new class of Senators was sworn in. Garland and Obama may simply not wanted a part in any of these gambits.

<TEXT> He's not wrong. 

Just about a week ago, people like Tillerson and Spicer were publicly signalling that the U.S. would acquiesce to Assad remaining in power, which the New York Times characterized as a "remarkable reversal of American foreign policy...[b]y any measure." *See* [White House Accepts Political Reality of Assads Grip on Power in Syria](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/us/politics/trump-bashar-assad-syria.html?_r=0 referer=https://mobile-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.amp.html?amp_js_v=9) (March 31, 2017):

President Trump has abandoned the goal of pressing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to leave power, marking a sharp departure from the Middle East policy that guided the Obama administration for more tha
n five years, the White House said on Friday.

With respect to Assad, there is a political reality that we have to accept, said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.

The United States has profound priorities in Syria and Iraq, and weve made it clear that counterterrorism, particularly the defeat of ISIS, is foremost among those priorities, he added, using the acronym for the Islamic State.

In a sense, Mr. Spicers comments  and similar comments on Thursday by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations  have merely made explicit an assumption that has guided the Trump administrations policy toward the region in recent months.

Assad didn't need to use chemical weapons for purely military reasons. But he's been pursuing a [strategy to demoralize the opposition by conducting ruthless attacks on civilians in rebel-held areas](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.html), and showing that he can get away with these attacks without any consequences from the international community.

 Nerve gasas we've seen from the horrifying images out of Idlibcan be a highly effective weapon of terror. Assad may have thought, in light of the Trump Regime's apparent abandonment of the US policy to pursue regime change in Syria, and Congress having blocked President Obama's prior request for authorization to conduct a retaliatory strike when Assad used nerve gas in 2013, that he could get away with using it again. 

This won't have been the first time that a country potentially misinterpreted a muddled signal from the U.S. In 1991, comments by the US Ambassador to Iraq [may have been taken by Saddam Hussein as signalling that the US would turn a blind eye to an invasion of Kuwait](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/09/wikileaks-april-glaspie-and-saddam-hussein/):

U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie told Saddam, [W]e have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. The U.S. State Department had earlier told Saddam that Washington had no special defense or security commitments to Kuwait. The United States may not have intended to give Iraq a green light, but that is effectively what it did."

The Trump Regime's muddled message may have contributed to something similar here.       </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right but you linked to a type of bomb whose damage is more of a pain in the ass to repair. It penetrates and craters the surface upon impact, then burrows underground and detonates a secondary charge. The secondary charge displaces the ground and misalligns the adjacent concrete slabs. So you don't just have to plug a hole with some asphalt. You have to realign the slabs. Ultimately, they can be fixed. But you're not going to be flying off of it immediately after.

<TEXT> At least 86 people in the northwestern town of Khan Sheikhoun were killed Tuesday in a chemical attack that left hundreds choking, fitting or foaming at the mouth. Eyewitnesses and a monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Saturday that fresh attacks on the area  now a virtual ghost town  had killed one woman and wounded several others.

...

Residents cowered in bedrooms and basements throughout Saturday, underscoring the apparently unchanged threat they faced from the Syrian governments arsenal of rockets, barrel bombs and other weapons that have resulted in a majority of the conflicts half-million dead.

...

 The missile barrage is the first direct military action the United States has taken against Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government in the six-year-long conflict. Although Trump warned of possible further intervention, the Pentagon has said no other strikes against government targets are in current plans.

Although American officials predicted that the strikes would result in a major shift of Assads calculus, they appeared to be symbolic in practice. Within 24 hours of the attack, monitoring groups reported that jets were taking off from the bombed Shayrat air base once again, this time to bomb Islamic State positions.

There were also reports of Syrian government and Russian airstrikes across the provinces of Damascus, Aleppo, Idlib and Daraa, all killing civilians. However, there were no reports of further use of chemical weapons.

The American strikes did nothing for us. They can still commit massacres at anytime, said Majed Khattab, speaking by phone from Khan Sheikhoun. No one here can sleep properly, people are really afraid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm fine with majority rule for the vast majority of things, including judicial confirmations. But here you had a systematic effort to prevent majority rule, followed by rule-changing to favor it once they got in charge. 

Also, if we're going to organize our fundamental processes around this principle, we should remove other impediments to majority rulelike gerrymandering, the electoral college, and the extreme disproportionality of representation in the Senate (all of which waste votes and make some people into second-class citizens). That's different from situational selective majoritarianism to favor partisan goals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right that they could do it now, but the optics aren't quite right.

Think about what it would mean. Right a.fter nuking the SCOTUS filibuster to ram through a historically unpopular President's nomination, turning around and nuking the legislative filibuster too in order to add seats to the SCOTUS. Then ramming several new nominations though for the newly created seats. 2018 would be a bloodbath.

As for the 2018 Senate map, it's bad, but it's also a midterm. No better time to defend seats as the opposition party. In fact, in 1970, with Nixon at 58% approval and 13 blue Senate seats in states he won in 1968 (Trump won 10 states with blue Sen seats up in 2018), Dems held losses to 2 and gained 12 seats in the House. At this rate, Trump could be at *much* lower approval than 58% by November 2018assuming he's still even in office and not living in exile in Moscow. 

In all likelihood, the Dems probably can't get past 50:50. But in a historic backlash wave election like 1994 or 2010, it's totally doable. Just need about 5% of the electorate to switch sides, some D outrage turnout, and some normal.R dissillusionment.

If they do, and everything is now 50+1 votes, then when Democets are next in power, just add two or four Justices to the SCOTUS and reorganize its docket so that it can take more cases (the Court takes about [half as many as it used to](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/roeder-scotusdocket-1.png?quality=90 strip=all w=575 ssl=1)). Possibly implement a panel/*en banc* system. 

That can all be done by statute without a constitutional amendment and an 11 or 13 judge SCOTUS would reduce the excessive influence of individual justices as well as the sort of gamesmanship McConnell pulled to steal Garland's seat.   </TEXT>

**Dr. Abdel Hay Tennari** administered the antidote to sarin, pralidoxime, left over from 2013 attack and victims immediately got better:

After a chemical attack killed over 1,000 people Eastern Ghouta in August 2013, the field hospital in Idlib province where Dr. Abdel Hay Tennari works scrambled to get stocks of Pralidoxime and Atropine.

Pralidoxime is the antidote for Sarin, says Tennari  referring to the deadly nerve gas considered a weapon of mass destruction. The hospital was only able to secure a limited number of doses of Pralidoxime due to both its high cost and the difficulty of obtaining it. Instead they bought thousands of milligrams of the much cheaper Atropine, which can be used to counter moderate cases of Sarin poisoning.

Those stocks helped save lives on Tuesday. Tennari, who spoke to TIME by telephone from Idlib, says hes sure the deadliest chemical attack in Syria in almost four years was the result of Sarin or a highly similar gas. The 22 patients his hospital received on Tuesday showed clear signs of a nerve agentdifficulty breathing, weak muscles and constricted pupils. But more importantly, he says, he gave Pralidoxime to the five most severe cases and they responded almost immediately to the antidote. (Pralidoxime can also be used as treatment for other types of nerve agent poisoning, such as Soman and VX)

**Munzir Khalil**, head of Idlib's health directorate, said on Wednesday that medical workers were struggling to cope as the number of victims was expected to increase.

"We can confirm the names of 74 people killed," he said, "but the hospitals expect the number to rise to 107 because many have gone missing and we suspect they have been killed in the attack."

Khalil said at least 557 people were wounded in the attack and transferred to medical centres and field hospitals across Idlib, in Syria's northwest.

"I can say almost all of Idlib's medical facilities include victims of yesterday's attack. Not to forget, air strikes destroyed a central hospital in Maaret al-Numan on Monday, a facility that once took care of up to 30,000 patients a month.

"That hospital is now out of service and we are in a state of shock."

A 14-year-old resident of the attacked town, **Mariam Abu Khalil**, said she had left home for her examination on the Quran  scheduled for early morning because fewer bombings were expected then  when the attack took place. On the way, she saw an aircraft drop a bomb on a one-story building a few dozen yards away. In a telephone interview Tuesday night, she described an explosion like a yellow mushroom cloud that stung her eyes. It was like a winter fog, she said.

Sheltering in her home nearby, she saw several residents arrive by car to help the wounded. When they got out, they inhaled the gas and died, she said.

...

Rescue workers from the White Helmets civil defense organization said that many children were among the dead and wounded. **Radi Saad**, who writes incident reports for the group, said that volunteers had reached the site not knowing a chemical was present and that five of them had suffered from exposure to the substance.

While chlorine gas attacks have become almost routine in northern Syria, this one was different, medical workers and witnesses said. Chlorine attacks usually kill just a few people, often those trapped in an enclosed space, and the gas dissipates quickly.

This time, people collapsed outdoors, and in much larger numbers. The symptoms were different: They included the pinpoint pupils of victims that characterize nerve agents and other banned poisons. One doctor posted a video of a patients eye, showing the pupil reduced to a dot. Several people were sickened simply by coming into contact with victims.

...

Witnesses to the attack said it began before 7 a.m. Numerous photographs and graphic videos posted online by activists and residents showed children and older adults gasping and struggling to breathe, or lying motionless in the mud as rescue workers ripped off victims clothes and hosed them down. The bodies of at least 10 children lay lined up on the ground or under a quilt.

A few hours later, according to **several witnesses**, another airstrike hit one of the clinics treating victims, who had been sent to smaller hospitals and maternity wards because the areas largest hospital was severely damaged by an airstrike two days earlier.

[NYTimes](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html?_r=0 referer=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39500947)

Turkey on Thursday said the first conclusive evidence of the use of chemical weapons had been found in three victims of the Tuesday, who had died in Turkish hospitals after being brought from Syria for treatment.

The Turkish justice minister, **Bekir Bozda**, announced that the results of the autopsies confirmed that chemical weapons had been used, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported.

The postmortems were conducted by officials from the World Health Organization in Adana, southern Turkey, along with officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Bozda said.

Later Turkeys health ministry said 31 people injured in the attack who had been taken across the border showed signs of being exposed to the nerve agent sarin.

Evidence was detected in patients which leads one to think they were exposed to a chemical substance [sarin], the ministry said in a statement.

The medical results from Turkey came as the Syrian foreign minister denied his government used chemical weapons in the attack. He also denied Syria had ever used them, even though reports from UN investigators have confirmed previous chemical attacks by both the Syrian government and Islamic State forces.

...

The postmortem results add to mounting evidence that the attack involved deliberate use of chemical weapons by a Syrian warplane. Aid agencies, including Mdecins Sans Frontires and medics in Turkey, said patients showed clear symptoms of exposure to sarin.

Rescue workers have gathered soil samples from the scene of the attack and sent them to western intelligence officials to determine precisely what nerve agent was used.

...

Witnesses said at least one Syrian warplane dropped bombs on Khan Sheikhun at about 6.30am on Tuesday. Shortly afterwards, first responders were overwhelmed with patients suffering from acute breathing problems, foaming at the mouth and writhing in pain.

<TEXT> It doesn't seem like some of the commenters actually read the article, or at least didn't read past the point where the author says that Trump is exploiting the situation (he is).

Here's the thrust of her argument: 

As for the left, a group of people I think of as my comrades, we sucked in our response. 

We went from horror at the chemical attack to screaming about illegal war and monstrous overreach by Trump when he launched a few missiles to avenge the poisoned. We claimed the strike was illegal (sure, maybe it was, but, dead babies scorched by Sarin gas....), we claimed innocent civilians were targeted (they werent), we claimed it was the beginning of all out war with Russia (no evidence of that at all). We yelled that he rejected refugees and if he really cared about Syria, he should have treated Syrian refugees with respect (he doesnt care, clearly, and the Syrian people dont want to be refugees in America, they want to live safely at home, without a butcher at the helm of the army). 

What we didnt do, was recognize that the laws banning the use of chemical weapons need to be enforced somehow. And that is only going to work if there is military might behind them. Sure, I wish an international coalition led by Europe was working hard to destroy Assads air arsenal and remove him from power, I wish there were international sanctions against Russia for assisting this murder spree of the Syrian people, I certainly wish it wasnt Trump who got the credit for finally doing the right thing. 

But it was the right thing. 

If we continue to refuse to acknowledge that, to fail to point out the clear political failure that let Syria turn into a bloodbath in the first place, to call Trump a warmonger instead of the political opportunist he is, we have failed our movement and this moment. 

And we have failed the Syrian people. But, to be honest, thats just more of the same from all of us. 

In other words, what she's saying is not that "the left" fell for Trump's dog-wagging, but rather, that it reflexively fell back on criticism of Trump for warmongering while failing to recognize that, despite Trump's opportunism, retaliatory action was still necessary.

I don't agree with her argument for several reasonsespecially in light of how innefective the strike apparently was (didn't even disable the runway). I'm just relaying it.

There needed to be a response to thatthough not necessarily the one Trump chose, which is looking increasingly ineffective. 

I doubt that Trump would get this reaction without the attacks fresh in the background. 

As it becomes clear that there's no viable follow up plan, the media will become more skeptical.

<TEXT> Great headline, and true.

[President Obama on McConnell's successful hack of the basic accountability mechanism under the American Presidential-Congressional system](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/obama-reckons-with-a-trump-presidency?mbid=social_twitter):

"Some of this is really simple and its the thing that **Mitch McConnell figured out on Day One of my Presidency**, which is **people arent paying that close attention to how Washington works**, he said. They know there are lobbyists, special interests, gridlock; that the powerful have more influence and access than they do. And **if things arent working, if theres gridlock, then the only guy that they actually know is supposed to be in charge and supposed to be helping them is the President.** And so the very deliberate strategy that Mitch **McConnell and the Republican Party** generally employed during the course of my Presidency was effective. What they **understood was that, if you embraced old-fashioned dealing, trading, horse-trading, bipartisan achievement, people feel better. And, if people feel better, then they feel better about the Presidents party, and the Presidents party continues. And, if it feels broken, stuck, and everybody is angry, then that hurts the President or the Presidents party.**"   

I like to call this **McConnell's Law**. 

The underlying principle can be distilled as:

People who swing and decide elections don't pay as close attention to politics as those who read this sub. They will blame the President and his party when things don't work. The effect is magnified when the President's party controls Congress and when the President is unpopular. The exceptions are few and far between.  

McConnell has used this insight cynically to extract the maximum partisan advantage he can.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I agree with you here overall. However, to be fair, the chemical weapons were intentionally avoided to prevent releasing the chemicals in an uncontrolled way. Which from my limited understanding of the chemical compound and how it reacts, makes a good deal of sense.

I think the area was intentionally avoided to prevent Russian casualties and the uncontrolled release. From my understanding, the two components (binary agents) of Sarin are stored separately. If they are released separately, they don't have the neurotoxic effect. Once mixed, the sarin has a short shelf life. Mixing and containing the mixture are supposed to be relatively complicated. So destroying the storage facility would have been worthwhile. There were also supposed to be chlorine gas on site, which would be toxic without the need for mixing. 

 ...and mainly by (4) the potential lack of follow-up options. I also don't trust Trump's basic judgment or competence to manage this situation.

 But then we get to this point... Sounds like they could just load up what they can of the stuff and relocate it. Was Trump thinking about what the following steps would be here? Probably not. He was probably presented with a briefing of current info, given 2 or 3 options, and told to pick one.

I agree. He switched positions just yesterday, and has the attention-span of a gnat. He didn't take part in the planning in any detailed way. He picked among ready-made options. 

I don't trust his judgment in selecting options, and I'm especially am concerned that he probably didn't think three, four steps down the line. In other words--if I pick this option, and the Russians or Syrians do X, what will my range of options be?

The likely choices moving forward are basically backing down or a significant escalation. Russia has said it will help further upgrade Syria's air defenses. And it's moving warships into the region. We'll have to see what happens next. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had mixed feelings about this strike since it happened.

On one hand, I had problems with (1) it being done unilaterally, (2) without Congressional approval, (3) while leaving the sarin storage area intact, and mainly by (4) the potential lack of follow-up options. I also don't trust Trump's basic judgment or competence to manage this situation

With all of that said, I was willing to wait and see.

 I've been horrified by the brutality of the Idlib nerve gas attack and [had thought](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/63xk5o/z/dfxw3p8) this retaliatory strike wasn't a terrible move to at least signal that there would be direct military consequences for hitting civilians with nerve gaseven if it was mostly symbolic and wouldn't substantially degrade Assad's *ability* to conduct such attacks. The idea behind such a strike is that it might make Assad hesitate to use nerve gas having seen the bad PR, our willingness to retaliate, and not knowing if our next strike might ratchet up the consequences. Not using chemical weapons might seem to him like a path of least resistace under this scenario. So in theory it could have a limited deterrent effect.

Now, with this report the airfield was left intact, I'm pretty convinced it was not worth the effort.  

Runways can obviously be rebuilt, regardless of how they are targetted. But I'm appalled that the strike **didn't even put them in an inoperable state for a full day**. Given the limitations of tomahawk cruise missiles, it seems like they needed to drop heavy earth-penetraring bombs or specialized anti-airfield bombs, like the Durandal. They might have hesitated to do that because of the risk of flying manned bombers over advanced Russian air defenses and the increased risk of Russian casualties on the ground. Yet, the fact that we're only willing to use cruise missiles creveals to Russia and Syria that we don't actually consider this to be a vital issue. We're not willing to endanger the assets that could actually get the job done. That's not a very effective deterrent. It sends the wrong message and allows Assad to act knowing what he can expect.

In order to not look innefective, Trump may now be forced to escalate beyond what he felt initially confortable doing. So this initial move could build a momentum of its own. That's not good. If we weren't ready to do it right from the outset, we would have been better off doing nothing.      </TEXT>

But I think that warning Russia was the better of the two options given the potential for escallation. If we're going to take actions that threaten Russia's presence in Syria, we have to get our allies firmly behind us and give Russia a face-saving out. Direct confrontation is incredibly dangerous.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> I [continue](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/63xk5o/z/dfxw3p8) to have mixed feelings about it. 

For starters, I wish it had been done multilaterally with Congressional authorization. I'm concerned with whether there's a coherent follow-up plan for what comes next. But I can't bring myself to fully disagree with what was done. 

Although symbolic, this seems better to me than doing nothing in the face of the [horrific Idlib gas attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/63w8a4/z/dfxlbne). It won't have a substantive effect on Assad's *ability* to attack civilians with nerve gas. The question is whether it might affect his *willingness* to do sowhich I think depends on the Russian response.

I'm no fan of the Trump Regime. But, politically, the Orange One benefits from this move.

Without evidence, I don't buy the "Putin had Assad do this so Trump could respond and publicly distance himself from Russia in order to distract the public from Russian election interference/collusion" conspiracy theory.  (Not implying that you subscribe to that theory, but I've seen it on here.)

Rather, I think being President continuously affords opportunities to be Presidential. Trumpor someone advising himseized this one. The Pentagon is good at planning and executing these kinds of strikes. It's unavoidable that some of this institutional competence will reflect on Trump by association even if he just chose an option and had nothing to do with the planning. 

The President's ability to set the agenda, especially with foreign policy, is one of the office's most significant powers. Yes, this distracts from Trump's scandals and allows him to change the subject. Maybe that was the point here. Or maybe it was just driven by the factual reality of the situation and people like Mattis and McMaster.  

Whatever the motive, on balance, I still think this was not a terrible move.                </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my hot take. Maybe I'm misreading the situation, but on the scale of shit I was bracing for, this strike actually seems pretty restrained. 

I would've liked to see a multilateral response, preferably through the UN, with at least some Arab countries involved.

They apparently notified Russia before the attack to avoid casualties and potential  escallation (at the risk of Russia relaying the  warning to Assad and making the strike less effective). On balance, that was probably a good call. But no similar forewarning was given to our allies (reinforcing the go-it-alone approach). Not good.

We'll have to see whether this strike was a one-off symbolic slapdown, or part of a broader policy to (1) stop nerve gas attacks on civilians, (2) stop attacks on civilians more generally and force a political accomodation with the rebels, or (3) replace the Assad regime. If it's the last, we still have no idea whether this policy is coherent or realistic. Whatever the policy is, though, right now would be the ideal time for Trump to anounce a change of heart on his cruel anti-refugee policyhe has perfect cover to pull a 180 with the Idlib attacks fresh on everyone's mind.

Finally, we'll have to see how Russia, the Syrian Government and Rebels, China, our Allies, and the world at large reacts. 

I have mixed feelings. But I lean toward *something* needing to have been done. Not sure if this.  Still need to digest.

<TEXT> The point isn't to turn a profit. It's to provide *humanitarian refuge*. Fleeing your home country under threat of violence is deeply traumatic, and adaptation takes timeand when they get here they face the same additional difficulties, such as skill and language gaps, and potential discrimination, that [foreign-born workers generally  face](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-economics/21709511-too-few-refugees-not-too-many-are-working-europe-refugees-sweden-are) (even when legal). When we accept them, we accept the responsibility to help them make this transition successfullyor we should.

I'm reminded of [this story in the WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-nebraska-syrian-refugees-find-a-warm-and-welcoming-community/2017/02/05/5615c82a-eb9b-11e6-9973-c5efb7ccfb0d_story.html?utm_term=.db2d8012fd2c):

Here in deeply conservative Nebraska, President Trumps executive order banning refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim nations elicited complicated feelings about the states relationship with refugees. Many Nebraskans had supported attempts to keep the country safe but still wanted to show their heart for people fleeing terrorism and war. Their state has taken in more refugees per capita than any other.

...

During the past two years, more than half of the 1,531 refugees resettled by Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska left the nations affected by the ban. They have settled 21 families  116 men, women and children  from Syria.

Nebraska has long been a draw for refugees. Unemployment is low, rent is affordable, and manufacturing and service jobs are plentiful, according to Lacey Studnicka, a program development officer at Lutheran Family Services.

... John Dutcher, a 61-year-old house cleaner, lives in a complex of low-rise apartments in a [Omaha] neighborhood where American flags flapped on porches. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Dutcher said he was one of those guys who would want to put a pigs head on a mosque. I never acted on it, but I played it in my head.

I hated Muslims, he said.

For years, Dutchers neighbors were meth addicts and rowdy alcoholics. Slobs. In June, a Syrian family who spoke no English moved in. Another family moved in after that, then another. Now there are six.

Soon enough, Dutcher said, empty bottles in the hallway were replaced with childrens bicycles. The loud arguments of a drug-addicted couple were replaced by the sounds of childrens laughter.

The Muslims here were all about family and they just loved everyone, Dutcher said. I remember the people who lived here before; they took for granted everything this country gave them. These people, they really changed my heart.

Through interpreters, he learned about the families stories of loss and fleeing war. It softened his stance on Islam and led him to question some of what Trump was saying. Around refugees, he never felt safer.

I used to be afraid when the meth addicts were here, he said. Now I dont even look to see whos knocking on my door. I know it will be someone with a plate of food or a kid asking me to fix his bike.

Dutcher said he continues to support Trumps views on strong borders and curbing illegal immigration, but said his experience taught him that refugees were a different thing entirely.

I like him, but I dont like the way hes carried out this ban, Dutcher said. I didnt think hed make a blunder so fast.

<TEXT> Let's be clear. 

This is abject moral cowardice by the Trump Regime.

The protection he's supposedly offering is from a threat that already poses [10 times less risk of death than killer vending machines](https://twitter.com/FT/status/826470867945283584).

And again, we're talking about the *difference* in protection between the [rigorous vetting procedures that currently exist](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/29/us/refugee-vetting-process.html?_r=0) as compared to supposed "[extreme vetting](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/27/heightened-scrutiny-of-iranians-shows-trump-administration-extreme-vetting-in-action-travel-muslim-ban/)" (*read*: arbitrary and symbolic measures, sometimes with ulterior motives, that make the successfully-terrorized *feel* safe).  Given the role of domestic radicalization in terrorism, policies like extreme vetting may actually be making us *less* safe by fomenting resentment and hatred.


We know from DHS Reports both that: (1) [country of origin is not a reliable indicator of propensity to commit terrorism](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3474730/DHS-intelligence-document-on-President-Donald.pdf) and that (2) most terrorists are [radicalized domestically well after initial entry](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3474730/DHS-intelligence-document-on-President-Donald.pdf).

Meanwhile, horrific acts of terror are being committed by Assad against people to whom we can easily provide help and refuge:

After evidence came to light that Russia was conducting more than generalized interference to discredit the process, but had instead purposefully helped Trump, Obama apparently wanted to disclose this fact.

[Mitch McConnell stood in the way](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.a16e9f9e6626):

According to several officials, **McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics**.

<TEXT> That would be nakedly political even for them. Dems could just change them back.

Plus, it would probably take 2/3rds of the Senate to do it.

The way the nuclear option works is by saying the 60-vote requirement would unconstitutionally raise the confirmation threshold beyond what's specified. That precedent is now set. You can't say that 51 votes is unconstitutional to re-institute a 60-vote threshold because that makes no sense. You'd have to put in place a new rule as an affirmative proposal. But Dems could nuke that when they come  to power even if they couldn't block it (which they actually can).

<TEXT> In perhaps his most public moment on the committee, he grilled FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers during a hearing early last month about how they knew Russia interfered to help Trump rather than just to undermine the US democratic process.

He used a sports analogy to demonstrate his point.

"My wife's Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns. She really likes the Red Raiders. But all the rest of the time, I mean the logic is that because he [Putin] really didn't like ... Clinton, that he automatically liked Trump," Conaway said. "That assessment's based on what?"

Comey replied that the FBI's assessment that Russia wanted Trump to win was "based on more" than the fact that Putin didn't like Clinton. But he acknowledged that that was "part of the logic."

If you like the Red Raiders, Comey said, "whoever the Red Raiders are playing, you want the Red Raiders to win, and by definition, you want their opponent to lose."

Conaway replied that "we don't know exactly when you guys decided" it was the case that Russia preferred Trump. He argued that the intelligence community's January report on Russia's election interference - which concluded that Russia interfered to "undermine the public faith" in the US democratic process - seemed to differ from their conclusion in early December that the Russians interfered specifically to help Trump win.

...

Nunes, who was leading the Russia probe at the time, echoed Conaway's assertion that the intelligence community had changed its assessment from December to January.

"I don't agree with that," Comey replied. "We didn't change our view from December to early January."

So it's [your] statement to us then that the FBI was consistent in it's assessment that [Russia] intended to help Trump, that's your testimony this morning?" Conaway asked.

"Correct," Comey replied </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comey: I've been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of **any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign** and the Russian government, and whether there was **any coordination between the campaign** and Russia's efforts.

Both of the bolded categories encompass Trump, if he participated in any of the conduct being investigated.  

Trump is part of his own campaign and is obviously associated with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Republicans started this norm erosion and descent into hyper-partisanship. They made the first moves and are far more obstructionist overall. 

After packing the federal courts with conservative judges under Reagan, they didn't want Clinton to have a chance to undo their project. Every President has had it worse since then. Yes, Democrats retaliated against Bushbut if they hadn't, Republican gamesmanship would be permitted to succeed without challenge. When Obama came in, Republicans didn't react proportionally to what had been done to Bush or try to de-escalate the situation. They instead took obstruction to a whole nother level. There were almost as many filibusters of nominations during the **first 5 years of Obama's Presidency** as during the entire history of the U.S. Senate. Rather than an extraordinary measure, filibusters became a routine Republican tool (that, evidently only they get to use). 

In 2013, Reid took action to counter this unprecedented level of obstruction. But he nevertheless preserved the SCOTUS filibuster. Republicans can now try to blame him and cry crocodile tears for the demise of long-held Senate traditionsbut they are the ones who brought about that demise. 

The stats (through 2013) tell the story:

<TEXT> He's under a counter-intelligence investigationwhich is even more seriousand any wrongdoing discovered will *automatically* be evaluated for whether it violated any criminal laws (such as espionage, bribery, or treason). 

Don't take my wordas Comey put it:

As with **any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.** 

Counter-intelligence investigation means they are deploying one of their most elite units, who normally hunt spies, to investigate the Trump-Russia ties. Spyhunters have powerful tools that ordinary criminal investigators may not. They'll then turn over the investigative file to FBI lawyers to determine if the conduct they uncover violated criminal laws. A criminal investigation would simply use another unit to perform the initial the investigatory atep.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way the nuclear option works is, someone raises a point of order, noting that the 60-vote requirement to invoke cloture (*i.e.*, end debate on the nomination before the  Senate) is unconstitutional because it has the effect of raising the confirmation threshold from 51 to 60+ votes. The Presiding officer of the Senate agrees that it's a constitutional question and puts it to a vote by the full Senate, which then rules on the objection by a simple majoritypresumably affirming the point of order. The former rule is then gone. 

What makes it "nuclear" is that it would normally take a 2/3rds vote to change Senate rules mid-session through an affirmative proposal. This move avoids that requirement because it's raised as an objection to an attempt to filibuster (*i.e.*, defeat a cloture motion with 41+ votes).          </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think this is all about Trump's insecurity and egothough it plays a part.


Bannon was demoted from the NSC. The NSC is where the Nunes leaks came from. The people who did the leaking, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, John Eisenberg, and John Ellis, almost certainly didn't hatch that too-clever-by-half plan on their own or carry it out without approval. My hunch is that it was Bannon's idea or at least he signed off on it. When it was exposed, and Trump's numbers went South, Bannon was politically weakened. McMaster and/or Kushner then saw their opportunity to make their move. I can see McMaster explaining how disastrous and improper the whole thing was, criticizing Bannon, and Kushner (the innermost circle) backing him in light of the numerous recent political failures.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> His statements are all bluster and bungling and bosh. Our commander in chief is not in full command of his emotions or facts or geopolitics.

We may sometimes think that the absurdity of Trumps endless stream of contradictions and lies ends at the nations borders, but it doesnt. The world is watching, and the world is full of dangerous men who see killing as a means of maintaining and exerting power. They see in Trump a novice and know-nothing, and they will surely test his resolve.

Trump has exposed himself to the world as an imbecile and burned through American credibility with his incessant lying. Even many of our allies seem confused and worried about where we stand and how we plan to proceed.

Trump is full of pride, obsessed with strongman personas, and absent of historical and geopolitical perspective. This is the worst possible situation. The man who could bring us into military engagement is woefully deficient in intellectual engagement.

...

...The Syrian and North Korean problems are complex and cant be solved by a simpleton. Every action produces a reaction. Every lever you pull risks a life  or many.

This is not about Trumps ego, even though Im sure he believes that it is. It is about whether this draft dodgers ignorance and insecurities could haphazardly plunge our country  and indeed the world  into an armed conflict. The King of Chaos isnt suited for the steady navigation of crisis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, I don't reason backward from the conclusion I think makes sense. I look at the reports and what they're saying. I look for other sources, independent from the first, and see what they are saying. I look at inconsistencies and ambiguities, as well as at what critics are saying. *Then* I compare the new information to my mental model of the world to see whether and how it all fits in.

This process has served me well in the past. For instance, based on analysis by former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter, I was pretty confident there were no WMD in Iraq before the invasion. 

Here, pretty much every reputable media outlet, as well as local activists via social media, are describing symptoms of a neurotoxic agent that Syrian rebels are unlikely to have. Western governments have cone to the same conclusion. Thesh back is coming from Assad and the Kremlin, who have no credibility on this issue. 

I have questions, of course, including about why Assad would use these weapons now and how he got his hands on them. Similarly, I'd like to see forensic tests corroborating that a nerve agent was used.

But with that all said, I simply don't find the idea of carting in bodies persuasive. I don't think media organizations are part of a massive coordinated conspiracy. I don't buy Russia's self-serving narrative. And I'm appalled by the human suffering caused by these vicious attacks. 

That doesn't mean that I support a military interventionparticularly a unilateral one. I don't Trust Trump to handle this crisis. But I do think something has to be done by the international community. As long as.Russia continues to back Assad, options are limited.

<TEXT> Here are some articles discussing experts' views of the weapons likely to have been used.

----------
###[TL:DR]

--------

The victims' (supposedly fake) symptoms suggest that a nerve agent, like Sarin, was used in this attack. The Syrian Rebels are highly unlikely to have the ability to covertly manufacture, transport, and store nerve agents. Moreover, nerve agents are unlikely to have been stored in a manner that could have caused them to be released by accident in an airstrike, and if stored that way would likely have been destroyed (nerve agents are binary, and unless mixed, won't have the neurotoxic effect).

In addition, there is other forensic and circumstantial evidence inconsistent with the Russian version of events (*e.g.*, lack of a fire, timing of the Russian claim) and no evidence for that version has been proffered, according to the articles below.

###Excerpts

[**BBC -- Syria chemical 'attack': What we know**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39500947)

**Is Russia's explanation credible?**

**Hamish de Bretton-Gordon**, a former commanding officer of the British Armed Forces Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment, said it was "pretty fanciful".

"Axiomatically, if you blow up Sarin, you destroy it," he told the BBC.

"It's very clear it's a Sarin attack," he added. "The view that it's an al-Qaeda or rebel stockpile of Sarin that's been blown up in an explosion, I think is completely unsustainable and completely untrue."

...

The UK's representative to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, also told the Security Council that his country had seen nothing to suggest that any non-state actors in Syria had the sort of chemical weapons that would have been consistent with the symptoms.

Francois Delattre of France meanwhile said there was "no fire" after the air strike, even though a strike on an ammunition depot "would have caused a fire".

It was also not clear why there was several hours' difference between the time of the strike reported by multiple witnesses and that stated by Russia.

-------

[**CNN -- What we know about Syria's chemical weapons**](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/05/middleeast/syria-sarin-chemical-weapons-explainer/index.html)


**Dan Kaszeta**, a chemical weapons specialist and managing director of Strongpoint Security, told CNN that the Russian version of events was "highly implausible."

All the nerve agents used in the Syrian conflict so far have been binary nerve agents, he said, which are mixed from different components within a few days of use. This is done because of the difficulties of handling agents such as Sarin, which has a very short shelf life, he said.

"Nerve agents are the result of a very expensive, exotic, industrial chemical process -- these are not something you just whip up," he said.

The idea that the Syrian opposition would be able to build the covert supply chain to make a nerve agent and then would move it around and store it in a warehouse, rather than a bunker, makes no sense, Kaszeta said.

"It's much more plausible that Assad, who's used nerve agents in the past, is using them again," he said.

OPCW investigators have accused ISIS of using sulfur mustard, a blister agent, in Iraq and Syria. But Kaszeta said there was no comparison, since sulfur mustard -- widely used in Saddam Hussein's Iraq -- is much easier to come by, is far less lethal and has a long shelf life.

**Charles Lister**, a senior fellow at the US-based Middle East Institute, also rejected the Russian account of what happened as "laughable."

"Are we seriously meant to believe that the opposition has a latent chemical weapons capability, and yet somehow, it has only ever suffered the effects of its own weapons and failed to use them itself?" he said.

What happened in Khan Sheikhoun "is an almost exact replication of what we saw in the summer of 2013," Lister told CNN, adding that it had targeted a key staging area for an opposition push into northern Hama late last month.

Lister also highlighted the issue that all nerve agents known to be in Syria are binary weapons.

"First of all, nobody in their right mind would ever store both both components of a binary nerve agent in the same building. And secondly, even if they were stored together and then targeted, blowing them up would not result in any active nerve agent -- it's chemically impossible," he said.

[**Al Jazeera -- 'Chemical attack' in Syria draws international outrage**](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/chemical-attack-syria-170404195457304.html)

**Charles Duelfer**, a chemical weapons expert in Washington DC, said it was "unlikely" that the attack was not the work of the Syrian regime.

"What changed is the nature of the agent," he told Al Jazeera. "There were previous cases where the OPCW [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons] and the UN have identified that the regime used a chemical but it's only been chlorine. This agent appears to be a military agent which is far more effective." 

Duelfer also said it was "puzzling" why government forces appeared to have resorted to using chemical weapons at a time when they are doing well militarily on the ground.

"They [chemical weapons] are not really serving a substantial military purpose. They can certainly spread terror, and they certainly seem to have a political effect, although it's hard for me to calculate how that would be a positive thing for Bashar al-Assad right now - unless he wants to demonstrate that he's there, no matter what anyone else says or wants to do about it."

What chemical agent was involved?

This won't be known for sure until tests are carried out but medical experts report symptoms consistent with the use of nerve agents, which include Sarin.

The World Health Organization says the victims' symptoms are consistent with exposure to nerve agents, pointing to "the apparent lack of external injuries" and "acute respiratory distress as the main cause of death."
Doctors without Borders, or MSF, said a team providing support to the emergency department of Bab Al Hawa hospital in Idlib province had "confirmed that patients' symptoms are consistent with exposure to a neurotoxic agent such as Sarin gas."

[**Doctors without borders -- Syria: Khan Sheikhoun Victims Show Symptoms Consistent with Exposure to Chemical Substances**](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/syria-khan-sheikhoun-victims-show-symptoms-consistent-exposure-chemical-substances)

Doctors Without Borders/Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) medical team supporting the emergency department at Bab Al Hawa Hospital in Syria's Idlib Province has confirmed that patients' symptoms are consistent with exposure to a neurotoxic agent.

A number of victims of the April 4 attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun were brought to the hospital, located about 60 miles to the north, near the Turkish border. Eight people who were examined by MSF staff displayed symptoms consistent with exposure to an agent such as sarin gas or similar compounds, including constricted pupils, muscle spasms and involuntary defecation.

<TEXT> I provided one link to a report exemplifying the claim. At the time I wrote the comment, I'd also read other reports. 

The article I linked to quoted an expert, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who was interviewed by the BBC. 

Here's the excerpt from that article discussing his comments:

A chemical weapons expert, Col Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, told the BBC that the Russian version of events was "pretty fanciful".

The idea that a nerve gas like Sarin could spread after a weapons manufacturing process had been bombed was "unsustainable", he added.

Here's a fuller excerpt from the BBC, which also included statements by British and French officials concerning other aspects of the Russian claim:

[**Syria chemical 'attack': What we know**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39500947)

**Is Russia's explanation credible?**

**Hamish de Bretton-Gordon**, a former commanding officer of the British Armed Forces Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment, said it was "pretty fanciful".

It was also not clear why there was several hours' difference between the time of the strike reported by multiple witnesses and that stated by Russia.

Moscow's short account gave no evidence for its suggestion that a group was sending chemical weaponry to Iraq. The so-called Islamic State group, which has used sulphur mustard in Syria and Iraq, is not present in Khan Sheikhoun.


But there are several other experts who have come to the same conclusion. Here's a CNN report quoting two different chemical weapons experts:


[**What we know about Syria's chemical weapons**](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/05/middleeast/syria-sarin-chemical-weapons-explainer/index.html)

<TEXT> This presumes that quick legislation is desirable...

No it doesn't. I said "quicker to adapt." That's not the same as "quick legislation." There's an entire procedure for notice, publication in the Federal Register of proposed rules, public comment, and revision prior to finalization of administrative regs. This procedure is defined by the [Administrative Procedure Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Procedure_Act_\(United_States\)), a federal statute. Failure to adhere to this defined process can invalidate a regulation--just as failure to account for concerns raised during the comment period can make a reg vulnerable to attack in the Courts. Deference doesn't mean abdication of judicial review--just a refusal to second guess when there interpretation of the statute is reasonable and the record supports the promulgated rule. 

Adaptability just means that rules can be updated--and in many cases more narrowly targeted and less burdensome--as new, previously unknown science or empirical research into the effectiveness of existing regulations becomes known. This process can take years and involve extensive, non-partisan studies of the subjects of regulation. Similarly, you can implement technical fixes that aren't based on policy, but drafting or other kinds of errors. You shouldn't infer that adaptability *necessarily* means hasty rule-making. We can talk about concrete examples if you'd like. 

Rapidity is forming regulation and law leaves the citizen's head spinning and is ripe for corruption...

What do you think of the AHCA--which would regulate a fifth of the economy--going from draft to committee to potentially the House floor in 17 days? There's no inherent guarantee that the legislative process will be more deliberate, fact-based, or gradual. If anything, Congress is *more* politicized, ideological, and ripe for corruption.

Expertise in the field isn't really required for effective legislation...

It absolutely is, particularly in areas like banking, environmental protection, food and drug safety, or communications technology. Unless you want the sorts of heavy-handed command and control-type obligations that more market-oriented people purport to abhor. Subjecting technical areas to the gridlocked, highly-politicized, and increasingly dysfunctional legislative process by laypersons would not be an improvement. Congress has every right not to delegate authority if it doesn't believe regulation should exist in a particular area. Or it can revoke authority if it is badly used. But if Congress does delegate, specifying competing policies to be promoted and standards to be followed in doing so, it can make a lot of sense to let the nitty-gritty rules be designed and implemented by subject-matter experts with comments from stakeholders and the public at large. 

The *[Chevron](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14437597860792759765 q=chevron+v+natural+resources+defense+council hl=en as_sdt=2006)* Court actually explained this very well in the process of upholding the EPA's construction of a statutory provision:

[T]he Administrator's interpretation represents a reasonable accommodation of manifestly competing interests and is entitled to deference: the regulatory scheme is technical and complex, the agency considered the matter in a detailed and reasoned fashion, and the decision involves reconciling conflicting policies. Congress intended to accommodate both interests, but did not do so itself on the level of specificity presented by these cases. Perhaps that body consciously desired the Administrator to strike the balance at this level, thinking that those with great expertise and charged with responsibility for administering the provision would be in a better position to do so; perhaps it simply did not consider the question at this level; and perhaps Congress was unable to forge a coalition on either side of the question, and those on each side decided to take their chances with the scheme devised by the agency. For judicial purposes, it matters not which of these things occurred.

Judges are not experts in the field, and are not part of either political branch of the Government. Courts must, in some cases, reconcile competing political interests, but not on the basis of the judges' personal policy preferences. In contrast, an agency to which Congress has delegated policymaking responsibilities may, within the limits of that delegation, properly rely upon the incumbent administration's views of wise policy to inform its judgments. While agencies are not directly accountable to the people, the Chief Executive is, and it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to make such policy choices  resolving the competing interests which Congress itself either inadvertently did not resolve, or intentionally left to be resolved by the agency charged with the administration of the statute in light of everyday realities.

When a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision, fairly conceptualized, really centers on the wisdom of the agency's policy, rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by Congress, the challenge must fail. In such a case, federal judges  who have no constituency  have a duty to respect legitimate policy choices made by those who do. The responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones: "Our Constitution vests such responsibilities in the political branches."

<TEXT> Others have covered this very well. Congress doesn't have the subject matter expertise to implement certain kinds of technical regulations. So they delegate power to administrative agencies. This is important flexibility that makes regulations more effective and quicker to adapt.

I'll add this, though. One important example of an area where Congress has retained authority to draft a granular regulatory scheme is the Internal Revenue Code--which is pretty widely recognized as a complex, tangled mess of special interest carve outs and loopholes. Congress should fix this and continue to be the primary regulator on this area (which involves fundamental questions of public policy more than technical expertise). But the same approach would be a disaster if applied to something like pollution control, internet regulations, etc. Once the political decision to regulate (and with what objective) has been made, certain questions of *how to regulate* should be left to experts. </TEXT>

Under the move, the national intelligence director, Dan Coats, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, are again "regular attendees" of the NSCs principals committee.

Bannon and Kushner won that important initial power struggle.

Maybe McMaster has gained favor within the White House's chaotic power structure since then. But I think it's also plausibleperhaps more sothat this is blowback from the ill-conceived and disastrous Nunes leaks.

<TEXT> We all know Gorsuch is bad, but this article is making an excellent point about one specific way in which he's terribleand it lines up with Bannon's comments about deconstructing the administrative state:

As a federal judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, **Gorsuch has advocated tossing out the primary Supreme Court precedent underpinning federal administrative law. Known as "Chevron deference," after the high court's 1984 unanimous ruling in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, it holds that the courts should defer to federal agencies when it comes to the rules these departments design and implement based on congressional legislation** (which sometimes hands the crafting of the nitty-gritty policy details to the government experts). Chevron deference, for instance, allows the Environmental Protection Agency to have scientists help make rules for enforcing the Clean Air Act, and it permits those regulations to be modified in response to new technology or new threats to the environment. **But without Chevron, Congress would have to design complex regulations itself and pass new legislation each time these regulations needed to be updated or tweaked.**

Gorsuch planted his flag firmly against Chevron in August, when he authored the majority opinion in a case called Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch. In a highly unusual move, he wrote a lengthy concurrence to his own opinion, laying out his arguments for overturning Chevron and reining in the power of executive agencies. **The concurrence, which approvingly cited Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., reads like a job application for a Republican Supreme Court nominee**. It seems to have caught the attention of conservatives who aided Trump in his selection process. Gorsuch's name did not appear on the short list of potential Supreme Court nominees released by his campaign last May, but he was on the updated list Trump released in September after the Gutierrez opinion came down.

[TL:DR] Gorsuch wants to engage in radical judicial activism by overturning the main precedent that gives force to administrative law.

<TEXT> Nationwide, Republicans were more than 20 percent likelier to vote than Democrats (defined by party vote history and registration) in 2010 and 2014, according to an Upshot analysis of voter file data from the company L2.

But there are early signs this could be changing. If it does in 2018, it will be consistent with a longer-term trend in which the party out of power benefits in midterm elections, seemingly from a stronger turnout.

Democrats have fared well in recent special elections, and they have turned out in strong numbers in the four contests where complete turnout numbers are now available: a relatively uncompetitive special election in Iowas 45th State Senate district in December, two January contests in Virginia, and Delawares 10th State Senate district race in February.

...

A few elections arent enough to prove that turnout is really shifting. But there are other signs of higher Democratic enthusiasm, like the millions who marched and protested a day after Mr. Trumps inauguration, or the abundant fund-raising for Mr. Ossoff.

Parties out of power have long tended to do very well in midterm elections. It has been less clear why  maybe because of turnout, or because voters swing across parties to check the president.

...

... The best evidence comes from Iowa, which has voter turnout data by party registration going back to 1980. It tells a fairly consistent story: Democrats usually have worse turnout in midterm elections, but the Republican edge is greatest when Democrats hold the presidency. The Democratic turnout disadvantage is smaller  or basically nonexistent  when Republicans hold the White House.

On average, Republican turnout has been just 6 percent higher than Democratic turnout in midterm elections when Republicans have held the White House, like in 1982, 1986, 1990, 2002 and 2006. Republican turnout has been 17 percent higher than Democratic turnout in midterm elections when Democrats have held the presidency  like in 1994, 1998, 2010 and 2014. The same pattern shows up in the lower-quality data available elsewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Trump explored a presidential run back in 1999, he wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in which he suggested he would bomb North Korea if it didn't end its nuclear weapons program.

"I would let Pyongyang know in no uncertain terms that it can either get out of the nuclear arms race or expect a rebuke similar to the one Ronald Reagan delivered to Muammar Gadhafi in 1986," he wrote, referring to the U.S. bombing of Libya under Reagan's administration.

Trump followed up those comments with a passage about North Korea in his 2000 book, "The America We Deserve." In the book, Trump called US policy towards North Korea "weak-minded," and explicitly said he would bomb the country's nuclear facilities.


"**Am I ready to bomb this reactor? You're damned right**," Trump wrote. "When the Israelis bombed the Iraqi nuclear reactor they were condemned by the world community. But they did what they had to do to survive. The Korean nuclear capability is a direct threat to the United States. **As an experienced negotiator, I can tell you that negotiation with these madmen will be fruitless** once they have the ability to lob a nuclear missile into Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York. **I don't advocate a thermonuclear war, but if negotiations fail, I advocate a surgical strike against these outlaws before they pose a real threat**."

In the book, Trump also **dismissed concerns about nuclear fallout from the strike.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think (a) Garland now in exchange for (maybe) Gorsuch later plus an intact enforceable filibuster until 2020 is a bad outcome compared to (b) Gorsuch now (after nuclear option) and 1-2 additional Trump nominees with some actuarial probability (the realistic alternative).

Similarly, I don't think (a) Gorsuch now plus an intact enforceable filibuster to use against 1-2 Trump nominees is a bad outcome compared to (b) the realistic alternative.

Of course, the filibuster is totally illusory and McConnell cannot be trusted. So I'm not suggesting Democrats take the deal.

The other terms are secondary. 

Republicans following the rules *should* be expected. But we know to instead expect McConnell to game for maximum partisan advantage. We have to acknowledge reality. If there *were* a way to hold them to the standing rules and norms, at a time Democrats are in the minority, that would have strategic value.

Finally, I agree that enacting their unpopular agenda would be more damaging to Trump and the Republican Party than standard gridlock and stalemate. But their agenda will harm a lot of people in the interim, and is thus inherently worth trying to block*even if* it's less politically advantageous to Democrats than letting the policies fail and wreak havoc to fuel a backlash.

<TEXT>  I think that would be a good deal for the Democrats if it is accepted by the Republicans. BUT, if the Republicans turn it down, I think it backfires, because now the R's still go nuclear and confirm Gorsuch, and now they can claim that the D's opposition to Gorsuch is purely political and not due to Gorsuch's quality as a judge (which D's could plausibly argue now due to Gorsuch's history of decisions against the vulnerable and for the powerful), giving them cover on the nuclear option and ammunition against the D's in the future.

 In the end, I think the R's would turn down the deal, and the D's would be worse off having proposed it.

I don't think the broader public pays attention at this granular level of detail, and in any event, they likely already consider a large part of Democrats' opposition to Gorsuch to be political. And that [probably won't have significant consequences](https://newrepublic.com/article/141821/democrats-wont-pay-opposing-neil-gorsuch?utm_content=bufferd48b9 utm_medium=social utm_source=twitter.com utm_campaign=buffer). 

If they needed cover, Democrats could just say--pretty convincingly--that they were willing to cut a deal to de-escalate the situation, and that even if they did cut the deal, they still intended to vote against Gorsuch for final confirmation even if they did not filibuster him. And they'd have Garland and a 5-4 center-left SCOTUS majority to help keep Trump in line until someone retires or passes away.  

The biggest danger of such a deal wouldn't be from Senate Republicans labeling Democratic actions as political, but from the popularity boost Trump would get from pulling this off on his watch (and to be fair, if Trump had the political smarts to do this, he would deserve some degree of legit credit). The centrist media types would fawn over such a deal and start daydreaming about a bipartisan "entitlement reform" grand bargain. And there'd surely be stories talking about how Trump had managed to put the scandal-plagued beginning of his presidency behind him and reach out to the other side.

<TEXT> If that deal could be trusted it wouldn't be a terrible tradeoff. But, of course, it can't be. 

At minimum, you'd need a fixed end date. It can't be Trump's term because that could well end before 2020. It also has to cover Pence and any other Republican successor. 

It would also need an enforcement mechanism or costly signal that could make it credible. The best I can think of is pulling Gorsuch and re-nominating Garland in exchange for Democrats agreeing not to filibuster Gorsuch if another vacancy opens up during Trump's term. The other terms could remain the same. 

*That* would be a worthwhile deal, and since we'd get Garland up front, it would be credible to Democrats. It would be credible to Republicans because they could nuke the filibuster down the line if Democrats did try to filibuster Gorsuch.

No chance this revised deal would happen. But it would be the way to de-escalate and escape the current hyper-polarized mess.

<TEXT> This is huge for several reasons. 

*First*, there's extensive precedent covering the '64 Civil Rights Actand it's a powerful anti-discrimination tool. All of that precedent would potentially become applicable here. Since this is a federal law, it also preempts inconsistent state laws. There have been polls suggesting that the public not only supports anti-discrimination job protections for LGBT people, but thinks it's already the law at the federal level.

*Second*, the decision was issued *en banc**i.e.*, by the whole 7th Circuit, which has a majority of Republican appointees. This is now settled in that Circuit because you can't go any higher other than SCOTUS. Moreover, this *en banc* opinion will likely be influential even if it technically isn't law outside the 7th Circuit. If any appeals court outside the Circuit rules differently, then you have the kind of split that the SCOTUS would likely have to resolve.

*Third*, it underscores the importance of SCOTUS right before the Senate confirmation showdown this week. You can bet there are already at least 2 votes in favor of reversal: Thomas and Alito. Roberts would possibly be a third vote. So if you add Gorsuch, another *very* likely no vote, it will come down to Kennedy, who authored *Obergefell*, and can use this to further cement his legacy as a defender of LGBT rights. Affirming this case gives him a chance to put LGBT rights within a sex discrimination/intermediate scrutiny framework (to supplement the substantive-due process/fundamental rights framework of Obergefell), which could be used to extend the protections of multiple other federal statutes.

<TEXT> **The American Health Care Act, which was dead, may now be undead, or at least that is the hope of White House officials negotiating with conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus to revive the bill**, Politico reported.

The apparent terms of the bill's revival do not make a great deal of political sense.

Matt Fuller, who covers the Freedom Caucus for The Huffington Post, reports that the head of the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Mark Meadows, said he believed that **the deal would allow states to waive the essential-health-benefits rules under Obamacare - those are the rules that say health plans have to cover certain benefits like maternity care, prescription drugs, and hospitalization - and, in a change from the previous version of the AHCA, would allow them to waive a rule called community rating.**

Community rating is the rule that says insurers have to charge customers the same price, except that they may impose limited surcharges based on your age and whether you smoke. An insurer is not allowed to charge you more just because you are sick.

The Freedom Caucus wants to give insurers much more freedom to charge different customers different prices...


People who want coverage for expensive benefits, such as substance-abuse treatment, might wait until they need the coverage to buy it. Insurers, unable to block specific customers, would have to price insurance on the assumption that any buyer is buying a specific benefit because he or she intends to use it. Ultimately, the pricing for many benefits would become so unattractive that insurers would stop selling coverage for them altogether.

Obamacare prevents this problem by making everyone buy approximately the same basket of coverage. **
Under the amorphous new deal being discussed, this problem would be addressed through insurers' new freedom to price products however they wish for different customers.**

**Insurers still couldn't tell a person with cancer that he or she can't get chemotherapy coverage, but they could tell the person that coverage would cost $10 million a year, which is kind of like saying the person can't have the coverage at all.** This pricing flexibility would keep the sickest patients out of the insurance pool and thereby make it economical to sell coverage for chemotherapy at a reasonable price to customers who do not have cancer.

You can see the political problem, right?

It's part of a broader problem on healthcare for Republicans: While they got a lot of political buy-in for the idea that Obamacare "should be repealed and replaced," there was not buy-in from the electorate for Republicans' preferred terms for the replacement, such as that cost-shifting from the sick to the healthy should be greatly reduced.

Of course, a reduction in cost-shifting might even sound good at first pass. ("Why should I pay for somebody else's healthcare?") But when the specific effects become clear - the matter of greatly jacking up insurance rates for expectant mothers and cancer patients so young, healthy men can pay less - the politics become toxic.

If and when a revised AHCA becomes available containing this provision, it will most likely hit the same political wall that the previous AHCA did: The proposal will be very unpopular, with a loud and angry constituency opposing it, and no significant political constituency eager for it, except for rich people who want the tax cut embedded within the AHCA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heh. I like your Bat Signal analogy. I saw it as democracy's immune system in action. When the government attacks people, especially vulnerable people, it's civil society's responsibility to come to to their defense. Lawyers have an added responsibility because we know a thing or two about the Constitution and the rights it protectsso we can be useful in that kind of pinch.

The response to the Muslim ban I think was driven by its blatant unconstitutionality, empathy with the people affected, and a desire to show the Orange One early on that this country is bigger than him and that the rule of law is a thing here.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hehe. You got me thinking about random shit so I may bloviate for a bit.

When you hire a lawyer, especially in litigation, you're hiring someone to do the best job they can representing *your* interests (if they take it as seriously as they're legally required to), but having specialized legal knowlege at their disposal to do it. At least that's how I approach it. What would I do *myself* if I were in this person's shoes facing this problem?

This produces one-sided output by designthe theory being that the other side will also put forth their best version of what happened, and the truth will somehow emerge from the adversarial clash of the opposing positions. 

It can work well in certain situationsbut it also has side-effects, including on the lawyers. Since not every client is actually right, sometimes, you have to be able to come up with good reasons for getting to the wrong result. And you have to believe in the cause too, otherwise you can't argue it zealously and effectively. So lawyering is a profession that rewards being able to quickly develop and adopt strong defensible positions that you wouldn't necessarily hold yourself. But that takes a toll. Some part of the soul is consumed getting though law school and another part from doing this over and over. I just didn't think it was 1999/2000ths of it. 

Not yet, anyway.

**[TL:DR] Lawyers are trained to generate one-sided arguments for** ***either*** **side. So when we're representing the wrong sideor if both sides are wrongwe're basically full of shit, and others perceive it. Constant proximity to bullshit exacts a toll.**


----

But, getting back to your point

 I support all of these process reforms as well. Not because I believe it will help Democrats, but because it will benefit democracy and, ultimately, governance. I wish we were able to improve processes for the sake of it, without considering whether it would benefit our side.

Here's what I came up with a while back, before the election, when I was feeling inspired to write down a [comprehensive package of process reforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/52kzbg/comment/d7lgrsc).

Maybe I'll write a reformed model Constitution one of these days based on this package if I'm bored or the Orange One takes a breather from the buffoonery. Or perhaps it can be done together with other people who are also interestedas a Google doc, or something.               </TEXT>

If they were proud of what they'd done with Garland, they'd own it.

Garland was subjected to a 310 day wait with no actionthe longest delay faced by any SCOTUS nominee since 1869, when instituted a 9-member Court. The previous record was 127 days from nomination to successful confirmation. There was ample time to consider and reject or confirm Garland.

<TEXT> Check out the first part of the discussion link. [TL:DR] It would typically be the U.S. Attorney for DC (a subordinate of Sessions), or possibly a special prosecutor (normally would be appointed by Sessions but for his recusal from anything related to Russia). But yeah, in essence, Sessions would directly or indirectly be the boss of whomever brought the case against him. 

*Awkward*. (Read: potentially career-ending).

This is why the A.G. is an incredibly powerful position. You could argue that, if the Republic survives the Trump Regime, we might want to craete an independent arm of the DoJ to watch the watchers (with the obvious problem that you'd then need someone to watch the watchers of the watchers). Maybe it could be a civil service type deal, or maybe a panel of judges. Or just bring back the independent counsel statute.

<TEXT> You see, I've assumed and *still* believe that the average person is good, decent, and capable of making sound collective decisions. 

Since Trump's election, there's been a lot of talk about how democracy failed us. If someone wants to appear serious, they talk about the growing distrust of experts and institutions, and lament how susceptible the masses were to Trump's crude demagogy (I remember reading pieces about how Trump's  destruction of norms was mainly dangerous because he was clearing the path for a hypothetical *future* demagogue who might actually be good at demagogy). 

What's lost in this narrative is that the wisdom of the crowd correctly recognized Trump as a dangerous and incompetent charlatan. And the crowdor "the mob," as common people are often referred torejected him. 

Trump's election wasn't a "failure of democracy." It was a failure of *not enough* democracy. Mob rule did just fine.  It was the Electoral College that fucked us. Again. Just as in 2000, the basic democratic principle of one-person-one-vote would have given us the right verdict. But instead, our minoritarian, anachronistic, anti-competitive excuse for an electoral systemwhich purportedly exists to protect us from the whims the ignorant unwashed mob, but is [actually just a bad holdover from slavery](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5j8isu/protesters_interrupt_wisconsin_electoral_vote_you/dbebea2/)valued the judgment of 77,744 people in MI, WI   PA more than that of 2,946,436 people nationwide, and, unsurprisingly, got it wrong.

Trump is President not because a lawyers' vote counts the same as that of a single mom with a high school education working two part-time jobs, or an unemployed factory worker. On the contrary, he's President becausedepending on the accident of where we each happen to liveour votes are counted separately and unequally, in 51 different containers, and thus are not permitted to balance each other outwhich is *precisely how* democracies harness the crowd's wisdom.                             </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, so there are various potential and actual  conflicts that you try to remove with something like a blind trust. 

First and most obviously, to you don't want even the appearance of Presidents making policy that knowingly benefits or avoids harming the President's own wealth or income, because that raises questions of ulterior motive. If Trump continues to benefit directly from his businesses, his descion-making can be improperly influenced. Ideally, the President should not even know what he owns so that he can't possibly favor it. Giving up management of a company to a close family member but continuing to own it and have the power to fire the family member is grossly inadequateespecially if you're briefed on your holdings and how they're doing.

Secondly, even if a President is unaware of his holdings and makes decisions independent of any effect on them, you also don't want the people managing the President's money to have material non-public information at their disposal. The managers should be in the same position as the investing public, not having any special insight into what happens next. If they do have such information, they can adjust the holdings to benefit at the expense.of others. It's akin to insider trading. 

As a concrete example, Trump has made a political issue of dolating his Presidenial salary. Originally he said he'd refuse it. By donating it, he gets a tax benefit at the government's expense. But beyond that, he can afford to donate the salary in part because he can withdraw money from his trust. And as President, he's increased the value of the property (presumably held by the trust) through actions he's taken. For example, visiting Mar-a-Lago frequently and using the access members have to him in order to raise the membership fee. And then there's the direct payments the government (e.g. the Secret Service) make to his businesses in order to simply protect him. So he's still getting paid. Just a lot more, a lot less transparently, while pulling his no salary PR stunt. 

This banana republic level graft and self-dealing. And it's happening pretty much right in the open*after* he falsely projected this same corrupt motive onto his political opponent.

<TEXT> Suing federal agencies for the rules and regulations that they promulgate implicates substantive administrative law, as well as the statutes that authorize the rules and regulations.

By contrast, what's implicated here are internal rules and procedures of the Senate.

I agree that the Political Question Doctrine is not helpfully namedit's more of a separation of powers justiciability and abstention doctrine. I didn't help things by not capitalizing the name of the Doctrine to indicate I was referring to a proper noun rather than an abstract concept.

In [*Baker v. Carr*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6066081450900314197 q=powell+v+mccormack hl=en as_sdt=2006), 369 US 186 (1962), the Supreme Court held that a case that raises inextricable political questions are nonjusticiable, and laid out this multi-factor test:

Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found [1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or [5] an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question. (Numeration added.)

Here, on the surface at least, you'd potentially have strong issues with factors 1 and 4.

In particular, [Article I, Section 5, Clause 2 of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section5) provides that:

**Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings**, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.

Facially, this looks like a textual commitment, so I think it would possibly be an uphill battle. But I haven't looked at the case law in any detail. Maybe you have? Like I said, I'd love to be persuaded.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Query whether a court would intervene to interpret rules of the Senate. Generally, with some exceptions, each house of Congress gets to set and interpret its own rules.  Courts typically invoke the political question doctrine to abstain from such cases. With that said, courts occasionally do intervene, particularly when constitutional issues are implicated. 

Though I support filibustering Gorsuch, I doubt courts would wade into a controversy implicating the validity of Senate procedures used to move a judicial nomination to a final vote.  But they might well weigh in if the Senate purported to confirm a nomination without a majority, for example, by preventing duly elected Senators from voting. 

I'd love to be persuaded otherwise if you have some special insight here. </TEXT>

Why would they Filibuster, anyway? He was unanimously approved in 2006.


A voice vote isn't the same thing as unanimous approval. Further, as you rack up a judicial record, people can reconsider. Recall, as well, that it's not all the same Senators who are there to vote. Finally, keep in mind that Gorsuch is being considered for a different and far more important position. The stakes for SCOTUS nominations are much higher. 

Those are just the reasons why his prior approval on a voice vote don't necessarily even imply a change in position for those who don't support him now. There are plenty of [reasons to oppose Gorsuch](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6339q6/z/dfr18tn) himself.

<TEXT> The way the nuclear option works is, someone raises a point of order, noting that the 60-vote requirement to invoke cloture is unconstitutional because it has the effect of raising the confirmation threshold from 51 to 60+. The Presiding officer agrees that it's a constiutional question and puts it to a vote by the full Senate, which then rules on the objection by a simple majoritypresumably affirming the point of order. The former rule is then gone. 

What makes it "nuclear" is that it would normally take 2/3rds vote to change Senate rules mid-session through an affirmative proposal. This move avoids that requirement because it's raised as an objection to an attempt to filibuster (*i.e.* defeat a cloture motion with 41+ votes).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The two-wrongs-don't-make-a-right framing is misleading.

This is basic tit-for-tat reciprocity: [proportional retaliation to deter future gamesmanship](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mygn5/mcconnell_not_following_confirmation_process_he/dc7sth4). And, unlike Republicans did with Garland, Democrats can't actually block Gorsuch if Republicans decide they really want him. They can only raise the political cost of confirming Gorsuch. I'm not willing to characterize that as wrong inder the circumstances, let alone equivalent to what happened to Garland.

If Democrats roll over and appease Republican gamesmanship every time, they incentivize the GOP's norm-defying behavior (and lazy punditry will still falsely equate the parties with the tired "both sides do it" framing). This leads to a ratcheting effect where Democratsand their constituenciesget taken advantage of over time. 

That's bullshit double standard that shouldn't be tolerated. It's on the GOP to respect norms as well, not just Democrats. They can choose to do so by not nuking the filibuster and picking a more moderate nominee in consultation with Democratsor by simply re-nominating Garland to de-escalate the situation. If they did the latter, and Democrats agreed to let Gorsuch through on the next round, that would be a true compromise.    

You won't see that though. Democrats are expected to make all the concessions.

<TEXT> Lets start with how Gorsuch got to the point of being nominated in the first place. The judge secured a clerkship on the Supreme Court in 1993 after a post-law school year at Oxford University, quite an accomplishment for a new lawyer. But the clerkship began with Justice Byron White. White was known to favor his home state of Colorado, and it was unsurprising that he handed a clerkship to a bright, politically connected fourth-generation Coloradan. White had just retired, though, and a clerkship with a retired justice is not nearly as prestigious as one with sitting justices, because they do not work on Supreme Court cases. As a courtesy to Whites clerks, Gorsuch got to work in Justice Anthony M. Kennedys chambers, too  not because Kennedy hired him through a process based only on merit, but instead, because Kennedy wanted to help a fellow justice.

Then theres the question of how Gorsuch got his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. To be nominated for such a prestigious position, it helps to be politically connected. Gorsuchs mother was a Republican Colorado state legislator and later held a top position in President Ronald Reagans administration. Gorsuch was a lawyer to Philip Anschutz, one of the wealthiest people in the state and country, who advocated on his behalf. The conservative billionaire helped push Gorsuchs case for nomination to the appeals court with President George W. Bush. Gorsuch must be grateful, because even as a 10th Circuit judge, he has continued to speak at off-the-record events for Anschutz.

Would Gorsuch have been in the position he is in today if life were a pure meritocracy? Who knows, but I wouldnt count on it. There are often more qualified people than there are positions.

This is not to say that Gorsuch is unqualified. Far from it. But often, it is not just quality that matters in terms of who gets ahead.

Given Gorsuchs background, someone like him  like many of us  should count his blessings and realize that aside from his abilities, he was helped by others along the way and could be in a position to pay it forward. He will almost certainly be in that position should he be confirmed to the Supreme Court, where fights over the use of race-based affirmative action in university admissions and hiring will continue to divide the justices over the next few years. </TEXT>

What I think is that it might backfire under a future Democratic President. It could also have indirect costs such as making Democrats more willing to play hardball, such as Garlanding any nominations that come up if Dems retake the Senate during the Trump Presidency. There are other possibilities as well, like ending the legislative filibuster or  expanding the Supreme Court as part of a de-Trumpification. Who knows?

<TEXT> Filibuster them too. The point is to force Republicans to choose a more moderate consensus nominee who won't be filibustered. If Garland had been confirmed, in all likelihood, Democrats would go along with a more conservative choice now. Over time, alternating party control keeps some sort of balance, even if the Court has not had a liberal majority since 1969. 

Yet, if vacancies are transferred to Republican administrations ala Garland, you get an unfair ratcheting effect. So Democrats have to fight back now however they can. The Constitution is at stake.

<TEXT> Pence can only vote if it's 50-50. He could break the tie on the nuclear option if two Republicans defect and Democrats hold together on whether to eliminate the filibuster. If McConnell loses 3 votes--not on cloture, but the point of order to declare the filibuster unconstitutional--the nuclear option would fail. 

There may be Republicans with misgivings. I hope Democrats don't back down at the last minute. A deal to preserve an illusory filibuster that can never be used in exchange for Gorsuch's confirmation would be the worst possible outcome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Putting aside the open question of Trump's legitimacy to even make this appointment, I think there are two grounds that justify the planned filibuster. 

(1) Substantively, Gorsuch is to the right of Scalia and Alito and will be part of the same radical right-wing project to expand corporate power, curtail the regulatory functions of the federal government, break organized labor, weaken consumer legal protections, and undermine women's reproductive choices. He has exceptional qualifications and an affable demeanor, but that doesn't outweigh the former. He failed to answer even basic questions about landmark cases like *Griswold v. Conneticut* and *Brown v. Board of Education*. Apparently, it was a [conscious strategy](http://thehill.com/homenews/news/325343-gorsuch-rewrites-playbook-for-confirmation-hearings) that I think is pernicious and should be quashed before it takes hold. If you want a **lifetime appointment to interpret the Constitution** and, in many cases, override democratically-enacted policy, you should be prepared to talk in concrete detail about your views of the Constitution. 

(2) Beyond the merits of Gorsuch himself, there has to be a [proportional retaliatory response](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mygn5/mcconnell_not_following_confirmation_process_he/dc7sth4) to the theft of Garland's seat.  Garland was a centrist consensus choice suggested by Republicans themselves. (Here, there was no consultation with Democrats.) And he was relatively old by the standard of recent nominations, meaning hed be on the court for less time.  It didnt matter. Republicans refused to consider him for 310 days, which is almost three times as long as the previous longest time between nomination and final action since we instituted a 9-justice SCOTUS in 1869 (127 days for Justice Harlan). 

If you consider SCOTUS nominations after 1869, the average is 34.80 days and the median is 19 days from nomination to final action.

If you look at just look at nominations after 1900, you get 37.67 on average, with a median of 23 days.

If you start with Eisenhower, you get 60.82 days on average, with 65 days median.

Since Reagan, it's been 65.93 average, 71 median.

Excluding Harriet Miers, who was withdrawn largely due to Republican pressure on President Bush, here are the nominations sorted by the number of days waiting before final action during that last period:


----

1. Sandra Day O'Connor	33

2. Ruth Bader Ginsburg	50

3. John Roberts, Jr. (C.J.)	62

4. Anthony Kennedy	65

5. Sonia Sotomayor	66

6. David Souter	69

7. Stephen Breyer	73

8. Samuel Alito, Jr.	82

9. Antonin Scalia	85

10. Elena Kagan	87

11. William Rehnquist (C.J.)	89

12. Clarence Thomas	99

13.  (*Not confirmed*) Robert Bork	108

14. (***NOT EVEN CONSIDERED***) **Merrick Garland	310**

----

Bork is instructive. Republicans bitch about him incessantly. But Bork was denied confirmation by a bipartisan 58-42 vote. 

[6 Republican Senators voted against him](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/senate-s-roll-call-on-the-bork-vote.html) --

John Chafee (R-RI)

Bob Packwood (R-OR)

Arlen Specter (R-PA)

Robert Stafford (R-VT)

John Warner (R-VA)

Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-CT)

This isn't the same as filibustering Bork, let alone *refusing to even consider* his nomination for 10 monthswhich is what actually occurred with Garland. *And remember*: Bork was the guy who fired Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor, in Nixons Saturday Night Massacre. That alone warranted rejecting him.

So this isn't petty squabbling. It's strategic deterrence. If Democrats ignore each Republican defection from the standing norms and continue to be nice as they're trampled on, they reward and encourage further gamesmanship. So you get a ratcheting effect where Republicans take more and more advantage and are never held to account. By retaliating and creating the expectation that every action has consequences, Republicans may think twice in the future.

<TEXT> I think OP may have been referring to [*general* strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike), in which a large segment of the population stops working, regardless of industry. Usually those are tied to broad political demands, not specific employers. General strikes are pretty rare in the U.S., but there were some in the 1800s in various cities, like Philadelphia, New Orleans, and St. Louis. There was also a general strike in Seattle in 1919 and San Francisco in 1934. I don't know of many recent American examples. 

Sustained mass protests and general strikes can topple governments and force action from political institutions that otherwise seem stuck. If you mobilized 3-5% of the U.S. population against Trump, and they stayed in the streets day after day, the country would basically become ungovernable until he resigned--and it likely wouldn't even take that long. The Tahrir Square protests that led to Mubarak's ouster lasted just 18 days. He'd been in power for 3 decades. Here's [news coverage in chronological order showing the evolution of the protests](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFCAAF4E47A0B5795).


[More Tahrir Square footage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwix_CMMLWA) (huge crowds... and [loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASnaFc3oRQY).)

I think three weekends of protests is a step in the right direction--assuming each of these marches are well-organized and large. People should go into it with a plan for how to continue organizing and building further protests on the foundation laid by these. One-off protests can be ignored. For example, a key next step for activists would be getting large protests during the week building into their weekend marches. 

I think that to get the kind of numbers required to force dramatic political action, we'll need something like an airtight revelation of direct collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the Congress nevertheless refusing to do anything about it. That could be spark.

I'd like to see whether they actually have the votes for that. They need 50 votes plus Pence.

<TEXT> Speaking Sunday on CNNs State of the Union, Schiff said Nunes and the White Houses actions proved that they were trying to distract from the broader question of what role, if any, Russia had played in the U.S. election.

It certainly is an attempt to distract and to hide the origin of the materials, to hide the White House hand, Schiff said. The question is, of course, why? And I think the answer to the question is this effort to point the Congress in other directions, basically say, Don't look at me, don't look at Russia, there is nothing to see here. You know, I would tell people, whenever they see the president use the word fake, it ought to set off alarm bells. And I think that is really what has gone on here.

Schiff, who last week went to the White House to view the same intelligence files Nunes had originally seen, also disputed the administrations claim, including from press secretary Sean Spicer, that the files were produced in the ordinary course of business.

Well, the question for the White House and for Mr. Spicer is the ordinary course of whose business? Because, if these were produced either for or by the White House, then why all of the subterfuge? There's nothing ordinary about the process that was used here at all.

...

Asked about Nunes's original claim, that some Trump campaign officials were improperly unmasked in intelligence documents, Schiff declined to comment. At this point, I can't say whether anything was masked or unmasked improperly, he said.

And he also said he was not prepared to answer one of the central questions his committee is investigating: whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russians to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign.

I don't think we can say anything definitively at this point, Schiff said. We are still at the very early stage of the investigation. The only thing I can say is that it would be irresponsible for us not to get to the bottom of this.

From the article:

At the rally, **Trump repeatedly said get 'em out of here before, according to the protesters, they were shoved and punched by his supporters**. Trump's attorneys sought to have the case dismissed on free speech grounds, arguing that he didn't intend for his supporters to use force. But Hale noted that speech inciting violence is not protected by the First Amendment and ruled that there is plenty of evidence that the protesters' injuries were a direct and proximate result of Trump's words.

**It is plausible that Trumps direction to get 'em out of here advocated the use of force, Hale wrote. It was an order, an instruction, a command.**

--

The judge was ruling on a motion to dismiss.  At this stage of a case, courts will assume the facts alleged by a plaintiff's complaint are true and draw inferences favorable to the plaintiff from those facts. If the plaintiff cannot establish that the defendant is liable even on this one-sided version of what might have happened, then the case is thrown out. 

But if the plaintiff's allegations can support liability, then the case is allowed to move forward to discovery.

All the judge is saying here is that he can't say, as a matter of law, that what Trump said was not inciting violence. Whether it was or not still has to be established with evidence.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is probably one of the most important things to come out of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday.

[Trump shamelessly mischaracterized, exaggerated, and exploited the leaked information](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-wikileaks-emails-a-window-inside-clinton-corruption) (link to Trump's own statements on his campaign site). 

David Frum's has been saying this for a while, including in this excellent piece from December:

[How Trump Made Russia's Hacking More Effective](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-trump-made-russias-hacking-more-effective/511880/)

**The content of the Russian-hacked emails was actually remarkably unexplosive.** Probably the biggest news was that Hillary Clinton had expressed herself in favor of a hemispheric common market in speeches to Wall Street executives. Otherwise, we learned from them that some people at the Democratic National Committee favored a lifelong Democrat for their partys nomination over a socialist interloper who had joined the party for his own convenience. We learned that many Democrats, including Chelsea Clinton, disapproved of the ethical shortcomings of some of the people in Bill Clintons inner circle. We learned that Hillary Clinton acknowledged differences between her public and private positions on some issues. **None of this even remotely corroborated Donald Trumps wild characterizations of the Russian-hacked, Wikileaks-published material.**

[*Trump statement*] These Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty. This criminal government cartel doesnt recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations.

Or:

[*Trump statement*] The more emails WikiLeaks releases, the more lines between the Clinton Foundation, the secretary of state's office and the Clintons' personal financesthey all get blurred  I mean, at what pointat what point do we say it? Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency.

**Without Trumps own willingness to make false claims and misuse Russian-provided information, the Wikileaks material would have deflated of its own boringness. The Russian-hacked material did damage because, and only because, Russia found a willing accomplice in the person of Donald J. Trump.**

Many questions remain about how the Russian spy services did what they did. That includes Putins motives for ordering the operation. But on issues from Crimea to Syria to NATO to the breakup of the European Union, Trumps publicly expressed views align with Putins wishes.

**Over Trumps motives for collaborating so full-throatedly with Russian espionage, there hangs a greater and more disturbing mysterya mystery that Trump seems in no hurry to dispel.** And maybe he is wise to leave the mystery in place: as delegitimizing as it is, its very possible the truth would be even worse.    

I agree, and am glad to see this issue finally getting some traction. 

Yes, direct collusion would be worseand may have occured. But even without it, Trump shouldn't be given a free pass for his conscious exploitation of the Russian *dezinformatsiya* and influence campaign. **That much we already know occured.**

 Trump was briefed privately by the Intel Community on Russia being behind the hacks during the campaign, but in public continued with the absurd insistence that it could be some 400 lb basement dweller in New Jersey. He seized on the information itself and didn't hesitate to exaggerate and weaponize, even though by doing this he was acting as a megaphone for Russian propaganda.

<TEXT> I'm all for staunch opposition [and proportional retaliation](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mygn5/mcconnell_not_following_confirmation_process_he/dc7sth4). But I don't think Democrats should be as nihilistic and cynical as Republicans. Unlike Trump, McConnell, and Ryan, et al., Democrats actually care about the people who will suffer under the Trump Regime's policies. We should cut deals to make people's lives better nowprovided they're good deals.

 Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate. It's *their* responsibility to govern. They can't even agree among themselves, though. That's why they're coming to Democrats to begin with. They need Democrats to fill the hole left by the recalcitrant Freedom Caucus. 

This gives Democrats leverage if they can stick together. If they counter-propose policies acceptable to their entire caucus, and then say: here's something ~190 of us can get behind. We're willing to negotiate to get us 30 R votes. But they shouldn't allow Republicans to pull the same move by picking off a few Dems with token concessions or pork. No symbolic bipartisanship. Dems have the credible threat of falling back on "no" because they're not the governing party. Republicans bear the responsibility if nothing gets done. Yet if Republicans offer genuine concessions and the end result is good policy that Dems can believe in, then of course Dems should deal.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've previously explained some of the [possible scenarios in greater depth](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/61vc6s/z/dfhmnio). 

Here, I'll just outline what I think is the simplest way to have a new Presidential election *before 2020*.

Foremost, it's important to understand that, **after the VP, the line of succession isn't actually defined by the Constitution.**

Rather, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 gives Congress the power, through an ordinary federal law, to decide who becomes acting President when the Presidency and Vice-Presidency are vacant. Congress did that with the Presidential Succession Act (PSA). That's where the familiar Speaker of the House, President Pro Temp of the Senate, Secretary of State, etc., progression comes from. The Constitution doesn't require that particular order, and it has language at Art II, Sec. 1, Cl. 4 authorizing Congress to schedule Presidential elections.

So, rather than the acting President serving for the remainder of the current President's term, the PSA could just mandate a special election on a short schedulelet's say, 90 daysto fill the vacancy. The acting caretaker President would serve only until the special election. The new President chosen in that election could serve until the next regularly scheduled Presidential election. 

Alternatively, if there were constitutional issues wirh shortening the Presidential term from 4 years to the remainder of the current term, then the PSA could just move up the next regular Presidential election to what would have been the next midterm election. Then, the next regular Presidential election after that would be in 2022, then 2026, and so on.  

Once the PSA is amended in either of the ways described above, one could create a dual vacancy by (a) impeaching Pence and Trump in that order; or by (b) judicially annuling the election and vacating both offices. Either would trigger the amended PSA.

Done.

<TEXT> More than just standard. Since the Civil War, there have been 39 midterm elections, starting with 1862. The President's party has lost seats (or a % of the legislature, when the House was growing) in 36 of them. On average, the loss is over 30 seats. This is one of the strongest patterns in American politics.

The three exceptions are 1934, 1998, and 2002, when the President's party gained 9, 5 and 8 seats respectively. 

In 1934, people were extremely pissed at the Republicans for the Great Depression, whereas Roosevelt was very popular and campaigned against their obstruction of the New Deal. Democrats gained 9 Seats in the Senate as well. This was the most successful midterm in American history.

In 1998, the economy was roaring and Republicans had impeached a very popular President Clinton (65% approval) over his blowjob. 

And in 2002, in the aftermath of 9/11 and during the buildup to the Iraq War, Bush was still at 67% approval.  


The last example is relevant because the Canteloupe Crackpot might try to exploit a terrorist attack to fearmonger and hold on. But the fundamentals say that Republicans may well lose control, despite partisan gerrymanderingespecially if he and Ryan (currently 21 approve / 61 disapprove / net -40) continue to be highly unpopular.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> CBS's Major Garrett.... pressed Spicer on that question, given the White House often complains about Trump's tweets being misinterpreted and not allowed to speak for themselves.

And technically, Trump didn't say Flynn should get immunity  only that he should ask for it. So good on Garrett for asking for specificity.

He got none, however. Instead, Spicer merely said the White House wanted to do what it takes to allow Flynn to testify.

Here's the exchange, in pieces:

    GARRETT: When the president says Mike Flynn should get immunity, is he suggesting to Congress that it grant immunity?

    SPICER: I think Mike Flynn and his legal counsel should do what's appropriate for Mike Flynn.

Deflection No. 1.

    GARRETT: Right, but they cannot obtain immunity; it must be granted. is the president recommending  either to the FBI or to Congress  that it grant immunity? Because that's the only way it can happen.

    SPICER: I understand that. But again, he didn't say, 'Congress should grant.'

So he doesn't think it should be granted?


    GARRETT: That's why I'm asking. What does he mean by that?

    SPICER: What he means is he supports Mike Flynn's attempts to go up to Congress and to be very clear with everything with they ask and everything that they want.

Deflection No. 2/3.

GARRETT: Right. But he could have just said, 'Testify.' He said he should get immunity.  For the president to even lightly indicate that he is in favor of that, it seems to me, is a significant development. And I'm trying to find out if that's what the president was trying to accomplish.

SPICER: And I'm trying to answer the question, which is that I think what the  not that I think, I've talked to the president  and the president's very clear that he wants Mike Flynn to go and be completely open and transparent with the committee. And whatever it takes to do that, he's supportive of.

That didn't answer the question, really.

You could be forgiven for thinking the White House was walking back Trump's tweet and suddenly decided that giving Flynn immunity was a pretty bad idea.

...[A]pparently the tweet was mean to be taken seriously, not literally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since the Civil War, there have been 39 midterm elections, starting with 1862. The President's party has lost seats (or a % of the legislature, when the House was growing) in 36 of them. On average, the loss is over 30 seats. This is one of the strongest patterns in American politics.

The three exceptions are 1934, 1998, and 2002, when the President's party gained 9, 5 and 8 seats respectively. 

In 1934, people were extremely pissed at the Republicans for the Great Depression, whereas Roosevelt was very popular and campaigned against their obstruction of the New Deal. Democrats gained 9 Seats in the Senate as well. This was the most successful midterm in American history.

In 1998, the economy was roaring and Republicans had impeached a very popular President Clinton (65% approval) over his blowjob. 

And in 2002, in the aftermath of 9/11 and during the buildup to the Iraq War, Bush was still at 67% approval.  


The last example is relevant because the Canteloupe Crackpot might try to exploit a terrorist attack to fearmonger and hold on. But the fundamentals say that Republicans may well lose control, despite partisan gerrymanderingespecially if he is at 35% or lower approval and Ryan is this unpopular. 


Democrats need only 24 seats to take control. 23 if they pick up GA-06 in the special election coming up.

Ryan's approval rating sunk to 21% overall, while 61% disapproved of his performance as speaker. The data prompted PPP to call Ryan "the most unpopular politician in the country."

At the start of Trump's presidency, less than three months ago, Ryan's approval-to-disapproval split stood at 33-43.

Even with Trump voters, Ryan has seen his image crumble. That group supported Ryan with a 52% approval rating and 23% disapproval when Trump took office. It has since cratered to 35% approval and 41% disapproval.

<TEXT> Also in response to /u/ailboles.

The gist is that immunity is an enforceable bargain between the prosecutor and person given immunity in exchange for their testimomy. It can be total or a more limited scope (*i.e.*, covering a limited set of issues, or time frame). The person must cooperate fully and in good faith. You can't get immunity and renege on your end of the bargain. If you do, your immunity can be stripped. Also, since immunity eliminates the risk of liability, it to that extent waives the person's 5th Amendment right to not incriminate themselves. So no taking the Fifth.

You remain subject to potential perjury charges on the testimony offered. So if you fail to tell the whole truth, you still have exposure. 

Does that help?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
The Constitution is both clear and precise regarding how the president is to be determined, and **provides only one remedy for changing the outcome of an election that has been settled: impeachment.**

Show me where the Constitution explicitly references election outcomes in connection with impeachment. There's no *shall only* provision.

Impeachment is defined by [Article II, Section 4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section4):

The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.

This expressly provides a method of removing federal officers. It doesn't say that you can't judicially attack the validity of the election through which they were chosen if fraud or some other misconduct subsequently calls its legitimacy into question.

Article III, Section 2 merely says that:

The trial of all crimes, **except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury**; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.

This differentiates between impeachment and criminal trials. 


In turn, Article I, Section 2, Clause 5, and Section 3, Clause 6   7, respectively, provide the mechanism for trying impeachment:

The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers; and shall have the sole power of impeachment.

and 

The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.

Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States: but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.


There's no question that impeachment can be used by Congress to remove federal officers. But there's no inherent prohibition on a court deciding a case or controversy arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States over which it has equity jurisdiction that has the effect of invalidating an election.  

From the linked post:

[Article III, Section 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section2) specifies, in the relevant part that:

The **judicial power shall extend to** ***all cases***, **in law and** ***equity***, arising under this Constitution [or] the laws of the United States...

[Federalist 83 (Hamilton)](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa83.htm) sheds further light on this broad and somewhat vague grant of jurisdiction:

"The **great and primary use of** a court of **equity is to give relief in extraordinary cases, which are exceptions to general rules.**"

Here, fully resolving the specific controversyan election tainted by foreign interferenceand fashioning an equitable remedy might well require complete annulment of the original election.

I'm not saying there aren't arguments againstonly that the judicial power is broad and flexible enough to accomplish this. The Constitution isn't a suicide pact.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few points about the FBI's decision (thus far) not to take Flynn's offer:

1. They may already have sufficient evidence of what he would tell them. Perhaps they believe they can get him to talk via a plea for a reduced sentence without total immunity.

2. They may still be negotiating or assessing what he knows and whether it's a worthwhile deal. He's one of the biggest fisha former three star general and national security advisorso they may not want to let him off the hook easily.

3. They may not think he has something worthwhile to tell them. This seems less likely.

Wrinkle:

Assuming they wanted to charge treason, they'd need two witnesses to each overt act constituting the offense. So some overlap in sources could still be useful.

<TEXT> Federal courts have broad equity jurisdiction under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution and could use it to annul the election in the appropriate circumstances (foreign subversion with culpable participation by the current President)especially with Congressional participation in the process (such as authorizing a special election by amending the Presidential Succession Act).

From a prior post:


Suppose a Congressional investigation finds strong evidence of collusion with and possibly even direct funding by the Kremlin (which is currently [being investigated](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-russia-dossier-claims-cia-2017-1)). ... This would fundamentally taint the election and would be the basis for begining impeachment proceedings.  But another track that could be pursued in parallel, or in the alternative, would be a lawsuit contesting the validity of the election itself.

First, you'd need to find someone with standing to sue. An obvious person would be any of the other candidates who took part in the electionespecially Clinton. There would be other persons with standing as well. But the key point is that this is the sort of "[case or controversy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/controversy)" that federal courts have jurisdiction to resolve.

[Article III, Section 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section2) specifies, in the relevant part that:

The **judicial power shall extend to** ***all cases***, **in law and** ***equity***, arising under this Constitution [or] the laws of the United States...

[Federalist 83 (Hamilton)](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa83.htm) sheds further light on this broad and somewhat vague grant of jurisdiction:

"The **great and primary use of** a court of **equity is to give relief in extraordinary cases, which are exceptions to general rules.**"

Here, fully resolving the specific controversyan election tainted by foreign interferenceand fashioning an equitable remedy might well require complete annulment of the original election.

Either the suit contesting the election works its way up to SCOTUS through the regular appellate process or it makes it there in some expedited fashionsuch as through an [extraordinary writ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1651) application. In any event, the Congressional findings could be introduced and judicially-noticed (including any supporting classified evidence under seal). Trump would have full due process and opportunity to oppose via an adversarial legal proceeding. Ultimately though, let's assume the courts were to decide against him.

In theory, that would vacate both the Presidency and Vice-Presidency and void any acts involving the President since the inauguration. It would also trigger the Presidential Succession Act (PSA), which provides directlyby statutefor who will "act as President" when there's no President and no Vice President.

...

There's [some precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_States\)) for passing legislation and involving the Supreme Court to resolve disputes about a Presidential election through extraordinary remedies. In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes "won" the election against Samuel Tilden by 1 EV under a [negotiated compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1877). **Hayes did not have a majority of the electoral vote until this compromise.** Tilden won an outright majority of the popular vote, not just a plurality. The margin was 3%the largest popular vote margin for an EC loser. This was possibly the most divisive election in American history. So it's not totally inconceivable that a bipartisan solution could happen here too if it's seen as being in both parties' interests.

The allegations and circumstantial evidence set forth a colorable case of treason against members of the Trump Regime. We've also been told that there's more than circumstantial evidence of collusion, but it hasn't yey been made public. 

"Potential", in this context, means simply that we don't know everything we would need to know to establish treason, and treason hasn't been charged and proved in a criminal proceeding. For all we know, there can be exculpatory evidence or insufficient evidence to prove any required elements of the crime.

There's nothing wrong with admitting this, and using the words "potential" or "alleged" to indicate it (unlike Trump supporters who branded Clinton a criminal without a trial). But, likewise, we don't have to refrain from discussing it until and if there a conviction.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> War isn't necessarily required. And I think there's a colorable case of treason to be made on this fact pattern without it.

The Constitution sets the outer limit of what can be considered treason at [Article III, Section 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section3), which provides:

----------

Treason against the United States, shall consist ***only*** [1] in levying war against them, *or* [2] in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. **No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.**

**The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason**, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture ***except*** during the life of the person attainted.

----------

The statutory definition of treason, codified at [18 U.S.C. 2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) pursuant to Congress's constitutional power to punish treason, defines the offense as:

---

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, [1] levies war against them *or* [2] **adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere**, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and **shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States**. (Emphasis and numeration added.)

---

Here, no one levied war against the U.S. (though some have called it an act of war), so we're left "adherence to the enemy, giving them aid and comfort"--a separate basis for treason.

Note that the key phrase "aid and comfort"which appears in both definitionshas a narrow, restrictive meaning. But it doesn't appear to require that Russia be a wartime enemy. In [*Cramer v. United States*, 325 US 1 (1945)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2809896451252158562 q="18+u.s.c.+2381" hl=en as_sdt=2006), the U.S. Supreme Court explained that:

---

 Treason of adherence to an enemy was old in the law. It consisted of breaking allegiance to one's own king by forming an attachment to his enemy. Its scope was comprehensive, its requirements indeterminate. It might be predicated on intellectual or emotional sympathy with the foe, or merely lack of zeal in the cause of one's own country. That was not the kind of disloyalty the framers thought should constitute treason. They promptly accepted the proposal to restrict it to cases where also there was conduct which was "giving them aid and comfort."

**"Aid and comfort" was defined** by Lord Reading in the Casement trial comprehensively, as it should be, and yet probably with as much precision as the nature of the matter will permit: **[a]". . . an act which strengthens or tends to strengthen the enemies of the King in the conduct of a war against the King, that is in law the giving of aid and comfort"** *and* **[b] "an act which weakens or tends to weaken the power of the King and of the country to resist or to attack the enemies of the King and the country . . . is . . . giving of aid and comfort."** Lord Reading explained it, as we think one must, in terms of an "act." It is not easy, if indeed possible, to think of a way in which "aid and comfort" can be "given" to an enemy except by some kind of action. Its very nature partakes of a deed or physical activity as opposed to a mental operation.

**Thus the crime of treason consists of two elements: [1] adherence to the enemy; and [2] rendering him aid and comfort.** A citizen intellectually or emotionally may favor the enemy and harbor sympathies or convictions disloyal to this country's policy or interest, but so long as he commits no act of aid and comfort to the enemy, there is no treason. On the other hand, a citizen may take actions which do aid and comfort the enemy  making a speech critical of the government or opposing its measures, profiteering, striking in defense plants or essential work, and the hundred other things which impair our cohesion and diminish our strength  but if there is no adherence to the enemy in this, if there is no intent to betray, there is no treason. (*Numeration and emphasis added*.)

---

From this definition, it doesn't seem like a state of war is necessarily required, because aid and comfort also encompasses overt acts which "weake[n] or ten[d] to weaken the power of the ... of the country to resist or to attack the enemies of ... the country." 

The key term that would be litigated, I think, is "enemy," which isn't defined. Generally, that means you'd use the ordinary meaning. 

Merriam-Webster [defines enemy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enemy) as:

1:  one that is antagonistic to another; especially :  one seeking to injure, overthrow, or confound an opponent

2:  something harmful or deadly alcohol was his greatest enemy

3

a :  a military adversary

b :  a hostile unit or force



Alternatively, you have the definition of enemy at [50 U.S. Code  2204](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/2204), which states:

As used in this chapter [*i.e.*, [Chapter 39 of Title 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-39)]

...

(2) the term enemy means any country, government, group, or person that has been engaged in hostilities, whether or not lawfully authorized, with the United States;

(3) the term person means

(A) any natural person;

(B) any corporation, partnership, or other legal entity; and

(C) any organization, association, or group

By its own terms, this definition does not control uses of the term "enemy" in Title 18--only Chapter 39 of Title 50. But assuming this definition *did* control, the meaning of "enemy" depends on the meaning of the word "hostilities," which is not defined in the statute. 

So we'd again go to the plain meaning. 

Merriam-Webster [defines hostilities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hostilities) as:

a :  deep-seated usually mutual ill will 

b

(1) :  hostile action

(2) hostilities plural :  overt acts of warfare :  war

2:  conflict, opposition, or resistance in thought or principle

Under either meaning of the term "enemy," but especially the first (non-statutory), it's not clear that Russia would be held *as a matter of law* NOT to be an enemy for purposes of treason. I haven't done a comprehensive overview of the caselaw on this issue, but I don't see anything in *Cramer* suggesting otherwise. If Russia isn't precluded as a matter of law from being an enemy, I think that there's a good argument to be made that emnity can be inferred from a factually intensive inquiry into the nature of the act itself--especially if we go with the first plain meaning of enemy as "one seeking to **injure**, **overthrow**, or confound an opponent." 

This understanding of enemy is consistent with the definition of aid and comfort as "weake[ning] or ten[ding] to weaken the power of the ... of the country to resist or to attack." And subverting an election for the highest federal office arguably meets this test--provided there was an explicit *quid pro quo* to secure illicit Russian campaign assistance (and possibly funding) in exchange for U.S. foreign policies desired by Putinincluding a weakening of NATO, the U.S.'s principal military alliance, and consequent impairment of the U.S.' ability to "resist or to attack [its] enemies."

The agreement to subvert our election would likely satisfy the "**adherence to the enemy**" element of treason (which could be further inferred from the delivery of pro-Putin policies detrimental to U.S. national security and use of the hacked information knowing that it was unlawfully obtained and disclosed under this illicit deal). Enacting pro-Putin policies and speaking favorably of Putin would likely satisfy the overt act of "**aid and comfort**" element. Russia has long been an adversarial power, and the hostile act of subverting our democratic election to promote its objectives and weaken our principal defensive military alliance would likely be sufficient to establish **emnity**. So if you had **two witnesses**, you might even be able to convict for treason in the strict [18 U.S.C.  2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) sense. 

Of course, as you noted, there are easier charges to bring.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> With Clinton, the Trumpistas took mere allegations as **conclusive proof** of her criminality, and ignored the *mens rea* requirement for the alleged criminal mishandling of classified information.

They don't get that the venue for providing proof is a criminal trial, and jumped straight to "lock her up!" Of course, Clinton was **never even indicted**, let alone convicted, of a crime. Rather, Comey declined to *refer* his investigation to the DoJ for prosecution (improperly editorializing in the process) after concluding that no criminal violations had occurred. 

They apply completely different criteria to their Orange God-Emperor. You need conclusive proof in order to *even discuss* his alleged misconduct. And if you afford the Orange One the presumption of innocence, by using words like "alleged," you're spreading fake news.

You'd think that *everyone* would see the hypocrisy behind this double standard. But unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.

<TEXT> I agree it may be easier, but I think it would be better for the country to effect the removal through an underlying substantive charge (*e.g.*, alleged treasonous subversion of the election) rather than charges related to the cover-up. If that can be done, it would put the removal beyond reproach. It's important that it beand be seen asa non-partisan action in defense of the Constitution.

Also, if removal is done via the underlying charge, there's a better chance that extraordinary remedieslike [annulment of the election](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/60yh2f/us_officials_info_suggests_trump_associates_may/dfahwbv)can also be sought. If there's anything that would warrant annulment, I think it would be procurement of the highest public office by fraud on the electorate in furtherance of a treasonous *quid pro quo* with a foreign adversary, as has been alleged.

All of this, of course, assumes Republican cooperation with the removal, which may not be forthcoming. 

This is where a treason indictment raises some interesting possibilities, because conviction bars the traitor from holding any federal office. Congress'  imposition of this baras a punishmentis constitutionally authorized, and thus would be distinguishable from the line of cases that says no additional qualifications can be imposed on federal offices defined in the Constitution.  

Therefore, at least in theory, a criminal conviction for treason could potentially remove someone from office *without* impeachment. We know Presidents do not have immunity from civil suits for acts outside the scope of their official duties. So, *a fortiori*, he arguably shouldn't have immunity from a criminal indictment relating to actions taken *before* he was even elected and which speak to the very legitimacy of that election. This matters because an indictment for treason wouldn't necessarily require Congressional cooperation or involvement (though committee findings of direct collusion would of course be very helpful).

Thinking out loud. Lots to consider and discuss.

He is being investigated by an oversight committee, the head of which, Republican representative Devin Nunes, has functioned less as a watchdog than a lapdog, providing information about the investigation of Trump to Trump in a breach of protocol. And this was not Nunes only misdeed: he was also present at a January meeting  between Turkish officials and Trumps former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who in February resigned in disgrace after being revealed to be working secretly for the Turkish and Russian governments for millions of dollars.

In short, the US has employed a president suspected of treason, an oversight committee head who refuses to do oversight, and a national security advisor who undermined US national security. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, some biting and insightful comments:

I worked for Kushner for 18 months as he tried to infuse a much smaller institution than the U.S. government with cost-cutting impulses from the commercial real estate world. And my experience doesnt bode well for the Office of American Innovation. Not everything that works in the private sector is transferrable to the public sector  and even if it were, Kushner isnt the best person to transfer it.

...

He viewed investments in terms of opportunity costs. Why should I put more money into the Observer when I could invest in a software company? he would say. This is a legitimate question for any returns-driven investor. **But news media doesnt scale like software. You need people to produce content, at least until artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated and sensitive sources are willing to trust a bot.**

**Why would you buy a newspaper if you expect it to scale the way software does?** Why assume that media and software have the same risk profile and dynamics? **Kushner would frequently point to a media company with a 60-person editorial staff and ask why our two-person desk wasnt producing as many stories or as much traffic.** Or hed argue, bizarrely and incorrectly, that because Gawker started with one person, that meant you didnt need head count to scale a media company. The Internet makes media more scalable, of course  distribution is unlimited and gained at little marginal cost. **But that doesnt mean a media company is just like Uber.**

**Cost-cutting is important in situations where there is excess, but it is not what catalyzes evolution; if the point here is to make government more effective, not just more efficient, cuts alone wont do it.** The Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Kushner has roped into helping him with the new office  such as Apples Tim Cook, Salesforce boss Marc Benioff and Tesla founder Elon Musk  would be the first to tell him that scale is important, and that growth is often a function of prioritizing R D investments. You prototype cheaply to get to a minimum viable product, but if you stop there, youre in trouble. You have to reinvest, constantly.

Lessons from Silicon Valley are even likelier to be misapplied in government than in media. Outside experts always groan that government institutions are running outdated systems that still rely on floppy disks, and that this is a function of some combination of government waste, idiocy and ubiquitous Luddite-ism. **But a more logical explanation is that systems upgrades require appropriations, many of which have been gleefully slashed by Congress. Theres also the problem of government pay, and the fact that the private sector has financial resources that the government does not.** Is it reasonable to expect speedy, high-quality upgrades when engineers are making $90,000 a year and implementations are often contracted out to the lowest bidder?

...

**I worry that this new office will be more of the same: a vanity project**, one that exists primarily to put Kushner in the same room with people he admires whom he wouldnt have had access to before, glossing government agencies in the process with a **thin veneer of what appears to be capitalism but is really just nihilistic cost-cutting designed to project the optics of efficiency**. If the outside experts have good advice, it will be heeded only where it reinforces what the administration would do anyway. **And anyone who volunteers to carry out the administrations agenda may be handed wholesale control of an area of government where their domain expertise isnt just low, but nonexistent.**

<TEXT> The great thing is that the NYT  *literally* established the precedent that created the "**public figure**" **doctrine**the legal rule Trump likely wants to weaken. *See* [*New York Times v. Sullivan*, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10183527771703896207 q=376+U.S.+254 hl=en as_sdt=2006) (unanimous 9-0 ruling). *Sullivan* is a constitutional ruling interpreting the First Amendment, so it can't be overturned by Congress passing a law.  Any law that purported to do so would be unconstitutional. But Trump's SCOTUS appointments could errode and eventually overturn it.

Basically, the [**TL:DR**] is that you can libel a public figure if the defamatory statement is (1) **false** *and* (2) **made with actual malice** (at minimum, reckless disregard for the truth). 

Trump's birther and wiretapping lies probably meet this test, if Obama wanted to sue. The statements about the NYT and other attacks Trump has made on various companies might satisfy it as well. 

By contrast, what has been reported about Trump himself would almost certainly not be deemed libelous. This is why he made a lot of noise but backed down from his threats to sue the NYT during the campaign.

---------------

Here are some highly relevant cases following and refining *Sullivan*:

**An individual who decides to seek governmental office must accept certain necessary consequences of that involvement in public affairs.** He runs the risk of closer public scrutiny than might otherwise be the case. And society's interest in the officers of government is not strictly limited to the formal discharge of official duties. As the Court pointed out in Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S., at 77 ... **the public's interest extends to anything  which might touch on an official's fitness for office.** . . . Few personal attributes are more germane to fitness for office than dishonesty, malfeasance, or improper motivation, even though these characteristics may also affect the official's private character.

Those classed as public figures stand in a similar position. Hypothetically, it may be possible for someone to become a public figure through no purposeful action of his own, but **the instances of truly involuntary public figures must be exceedingly rare. For the most part those who attain this status have assumed roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society. Some occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all purposes.** More commonly, those classed as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved. In either event, **they invite attention and comment.** 

Even if the foregoing generalities do not obtain in every instance, **the communications media are entitled to act on the assumption that public officials and public figures have voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehood concerning them.** No such assumption is justified with respect to a private individual. He has not accepted public office or assumed an influential role in ordering society. Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S., at 164 ... at 1996 (Warren, C.J., concurring in result). He has relinquished no part of his interest in the protection of his own good name, and consequently he has a more compelling call on the courts for redress of injury inflicted by defamatory falsehood. Thus, private individuals are not only more vulnerable to injury than public officials and public figures; they are also more deserving of recovery.

[*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.*, 418 U.S. 323, 34445 (1974)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202 q=418+U.S.+323 hl=en as_sdt=2006).

-------


**Freedoms of expression require breathing space. ** .... This breathing space is provided by a constitutional rule that **allows public figures to recover for libel** or defamation **only when they can prove both that the statement was false and that the statement was made with the requisite level of culpability.**

[*Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell*, 485 U.S. 46, 52 (1988).](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5069891851949874011 q=485+U.S.+46 hl=en as_sdt=2006)

One other thing:

Right now, opposition to Trump seems mostly focused on the threshold question of his legitimacy. This is important. But we also need to put in the day-to-day work of beating him politically on basic policy battles. There have been so many unforced errors (*e.g.*, the unconstitutional Muslim ban, the rushed and ill-conceived AHCA, the eviceration of internet privacy, the war on climate and other science) that we haven't had as much chance (or need) to do this. But we should get the opportunity with tax reform. Hopefully it will inspire the same kind of grassroots activism as healthcare did.

This is the second front in the resistance. It lacks the potential to quickly decapitate the Regime's leadership like the battle raging on first front does. Rather, its a war of attrition that can continuously expose the Orange One's lack of mandate and incompetence, and, over time, errode the support that remains for the Regime.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great analysis.

My favorite bits:

[Trump's] great challenge [is] the mismatch between the electoral coalition that (narrowly) carried him to victory and the collection of parties that he needs in order to pass laws.

...

**Rule One of coalition politics is that no faction gets everything it wantssuccess requires understanding the trade-offs that lie at the heart of every hard dispute, and trying to give each faction a win.** Todays Congress, under unified Republican control, sees politics differently. The lesson of the health bill debacle is that **too many members of Congress and of the Republican Party are still playing winner-takes-all politics.** Mr Ryan blames the failure of the House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on the growing pains of the first unified Republican government in ten years, and in particular the hard-right House Freedom Caucus of about 30 members who remained in opposition-party mode. **True, the Freedom Caucus are absolutists, but Mr Ryan is downplaying the scale of the crisis that his party faces.**


...

Democrats and moderate Republicans from swing districts called [the AHCA]shockingly ungenerous, while hardline conservatives denounced it as another government handout. Rather than broaden its appeal, Mr Trump and Republican leaders made the bill more extreme to woo hardliners, stripping away rules stating that policies must cover such basic needs as hospitalisation or preventive care, including vaccines and cancer screening. When factions remained dug in, Mr Ryan and Mr Trump pulled the bill.

Trump supporters cannot gloat. **When called on to honour his health-care promises, the president lacked the patience to study his own plan and negotiate.** Instead, reports have him asking aides: Is this really a good bill? even as he demanded a take-it-or-leave it vote in the House. When that failed, Mr Trump blamed the far right, while predicting that soon Obamacare will explode, forcing Democrats to help craft a replacement

...

**With a better man in the White House and a lot of luck this could be a remarkable moment, in which new coalitions are formed and political logjams broken. That moment is being squandered.**

<TEXT> We can assume certain things about the inadequacy of the process based on what we know. 

My criticism of Comey's actions does not assume that he necessarily didn't ask certain basic questions; rather, it says that he acted improperly regardless of the answerseven if he did ask them. Even granting that precautions were taken in the background, the process described in and evidenced by the *letters themselves* (updating Congress with an extremely vague letter he'd foreseen would leak) is highly irresponsible. 

Recall that Comey harshly criticized Clinton back in July 2016 when he announced his decision not to refer the private email server investigation for prosecution. That itself was totally improper and cuts against the rogue faction idea. In the first instance, Comey shouldn't have editorialized about the investigation and made the initial or supplemental Congressional testimony necessary. He's an investigator, not a prosecutor. But if he did feel that a letter was necessary because of his editorializing and earlier testimony, notwithstanding DoJ policies, he should have at minimum conducted a preliminary review and worded the letter less vaguely in order to quash speculation.

Let's actually look at [his first letter](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/full-text-fbi-letter-announcing-new-clinton-review-230463). He knew it would leak, yet it's incredibly vague and permits wild speculation:

Dear Messrs Chairmen:

In previous congressional testimony, l referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.

**In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.** I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and **I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails** to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to **assess their importance to our investigation.**

**Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant**, and **I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work**, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.

Sincerely yours,

James B. Comey

Second letter:


Dear Messrs. Chairmen:

I write to supplement my October 28, 2016 letter that notified you the FBI would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former Secretary of State Clinton's use of a personal email server. **Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation.** During that process, **we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State.**

**Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.**

I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.

Sincerely yours,

James B. Comey

---- 

As should be clear, Comey was fully aware of the dangers of "a brief letter...in the middle of an election season" and the  "significant risk of being misunderstood" that it entailed. He needed to conduct a preliminary review to mitigate this risk.

If Comey was lied to about the timing of when the emails were discovered, or if he found out that rogue elements within the FBI had been sitting on the info to maximize political damage to Clinton, then the people involved should have been publicly fired and censured. If they tried to leak the existence of the emails and alleged some sort of cover-up, Comey would already be conducting the preliminary review, which he could make public upon completion. And the full review, as we know, would ultimately have vindicated his precaution. With the news of the rogue faction being public, voters would be able to factor the attempt to create more damaging timing for the anti-Clinton October surprise into their decisions. 

Context matters. 

The complete lack of context is what made Comey's letters so damaging and ultimately, decisive.

<TEXT> That seems like a stretch. First because it was Comey himself who reportedly expressed concern about the proximity of the election. Also, Trump campaign cited the FBI's non endorsement as evidence that that the statement wasn't credible. Comey could've put that to rest.

<TEXT> Well, it's both.

First, you have the unlawful quid pro quo with the foreign adversary and everything that was done to implement it (which would have violated bribery, campaign finance, and other laws, and may possibly be actual treason). And secondly, then you have the high likelihood that the influence campaign succeeded. 

If the influence campaign changed the outcome, then nothing about the election should be permitted to stand. Reckoning with that will be a serious problem even if there's an eventual bipartisan consensus that there was collusion. Impeachment isn't enough.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *This* is the question to ask. 

Think about what the worst case scenario  looks like (assuming many of the key allegations of the Trump-Russia scandal are proven). 

You'd have:

(1) a candidate for President of the U.S. agreeing with a foreign adversary 

(2) that the foreign adversary would unlawfully obtain information about his opponent and then wage a disinformation and propaganda campaign through selective disclosure of the opponent's dirty laundry, coupled with fake news stories to weaponize the disinformation, and bots to promote it on social media, as well as covert funding of the campaign and possibly side payments, bribes, and sweetheart business deals not at fair market value (this is the ***quid***)

(3) *in exchange for* (***pro***) U.S. government policies favorable to the foreign adversary, and detrimental to U.S. national security interests (*e.g.*, weakening NATO, lifting sanctions for the annexation of Crimea) (this is the ***quo***)

(4) *while* lying to the electorate about the existence of this unlawful agreement and the foreign adversary's interference in the election--even when the opponent explicitly brings up the issue

(5) *while* shamelessly and knowingly mischaracterizing, exaggerating, and otherwise playing up the significance of illegally-obtained information about the opponent

(6) *while* the opponent continues to abide by campaign finance, anti-bribery and other legal restrictions that the candidate is circumventing himself through the unlawful agreement.

------------

Now, keep in mind that this candidate won: 

1. Michigan by 10,704 votes (0.22%);

2. Wisconsin by 22,748 votes (0.76%); and

3. Pennsylvania by 44,292 (0.72%).

The combined margin in these decisive states was, 77,744, or 0.0569% of the 136,628,459 votes cast. 

Put differently, a swing of 5,353 MI, 11,375 WI, and 22,147 PA undecided voters from Trump to Clinton--**less than three hundredths of a percentage point nationally**--would have changed the outcome. 

Even if you assume, for the sake of argument, that all of the unlawfully-obtained information about Clinton was 100% accurate, the fact that the information was selectively leaked is material and was concealed from voters.

Likewise, the fact that it was Russia doing it to help Trump, and harm Clinton, is material.

Further, if Trump knew that Russia leaking the info (through intelligence briefings he received as the Republican nominee), that's also material, since he denied it even as [he lied about and exaggerated the content of the leaks](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-trump-made-russias-hacking-more-effective/511880/).  

And, of course, if the leaks took place in direct coordination with the Trump campaign, as part of the *quid pro quo* above, that's certainly material. 

Concealment of these material facts--which deprived people of the opportunity to put the selectively-leaked and illegally-obtained information in context--almost certainly affected the outcome and should be grounds for annulling the election.

This seems like revisionist ass-covering. Ass-covering is one of Comey's specialties.

<TEXT> Nonsense.

Comey editorialized at length when he decided not to refer his investigation to the DoJ in July of last year. That was totally improper, not least of all because Comey is an *investigator*, not a *prosecutor*. Based on that initial editorializing, he was compelled to give testimony to Congress, and subsequently, to supplement his testimony with the infamous super-vague letter 11 days before the vote[which elected Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2). The letter itself was improper for the reasons I [discuss here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/the_fbi_is_trumpland_anticlinton_atmosphere/d9kctvb). 


Let's look at [his first letter](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/full-text-fbi-letter-announcing-new-clinton-review-230463). He knew it would leak, yet it's incredibly vague and permits wild speculation:

Dear Messrs Chairmen:

In previous congressional testimony, l referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.

**In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.** I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and **I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails** to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to **assess their importance to our investigation.**

**Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant**, and **I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work**, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.

Sincerely yours,

James B. Comey

-----

Compare with [Comey's Internal letter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/10/28/read-the-letter-comey-sent-to-fbi-employees-explaining-his-controversial-decision-on-the-clinton-email-investigation/?utm_term=.941a1b885fe1):

To all:

This morning I sent a letter to Congress in connection with the Secretary Clinton email investigation.  **Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have** ***recently been found*** **in an unrelated case.**  **Because those emails** ***appear to be pertinent to our investigation***, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them.

Of course, **we dont ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations**, ***but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed***. I **also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record**.  ***At the same time, however, given that we dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I dont want to create a misleading impression.***  In trying to strike that balance, **in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season**, ***there is significant risk of being misunderstood***, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.

Jim Comey

Dear Messrs. Chairmen:

<TEXT> The emails found on Wiener's laptop were only found in October. There wasn't a chance it was intentionally placed there to effect the election. He didn't delay his letter to maximize the effect.

[The emails were discovered in ***early*** October, three weeks before Comey was reportedly briefed](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-james-comey-hillary-clinton-emails-20161030-story.html). During that time, no effort appears to have been made by the FBI to seek a warrant or conduct a preliminary review of them. We also know that it took 9 days between the initial Comey letter, on October 28 and the second letter notifying Congress that the investigation's conclusions had not changed (including delays to obtain the warrant so the review could even begin). There was plenty of time to do a full review if withholding the new emails was not intended to maximize the effect of the almost-November surprise.

When Comey received the initial briefing on the emails, one of the first questions out of his mouth should have been "when and where did you find these emails?" Upon discovering that no action had been taken during the preceding 3 weeks, he should have demanded a convincing explanation given the obvious potential to increase the effectiveness of an October surprise (which should not be the objective of an FBI criminal investigation). The letter and the way in which this was handled, in violation of standing DoJ policy, evidence a [lack of adequate precautions on Comey's part to minimize the political fallout](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/the_fbi_is_trumpland_anticlinton_atmosphere/d9kctvb/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> That rationale doesn't make sense given that he was willing to send the improper letter to Chaffetz on October 28, 2016--three weeks later--concerning the laptop emails. 

The October 7 report was the government's official report. If the FBI agreed with it, Comey should have signed on. Trump even made hay of the fact that he hadn't signed on. 

This strikes me as trying to make Comey look better after the fact, because he's concerned about how history will remember his intervention (given what may still be coming on Russia).

At the very least, this is an unexplained conflict with the earlier reporting that bears some further digging and explanation in light of this new report. </TEXT>

#####CNBC, October 31, 2016:

[***FBI's Comey opposed naming Russians, citing election timing: Source***](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/31/fbis-comey-opposed-naming-russians-citing-election-timing-source.html):


**FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI's name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former bureau official tells CNBC**.

The official said some government insiders are perplexed as to why Comey would have election timing concerns with the Russian disclosure but not with the Huma Abedin email discovery disclosure he made Friday.

In the end, the Department of Homeland Security and The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued the statement on Oct. 7, saying: "The U.S. intelligence community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. ... These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process."

...

According to the former official, Comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to: "A foreign power was trying to undermine the election. He believed it to be true, but was against putting it out before the election." Comey's position, this official said, was "if it is said, it shouldn't come from the FBI, which as you'll recall it did not."

Comey took a different approach toward releasing information about the discovery of emails on a laptop that was used by former congressman Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, the official said.

Edit 2:

Here's the Washington Post's reporting on the DHS/ODNI Report that Comey refused to endorse publicly:

[U.S. government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-government-officially-accuses-russia-of-hacking-campaign-to-influence-elections/2016/10/07/4e0b9654-8cbf-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html?utm_term=.13de1ac75271).

Frankly, it makes no sense that the Obama Administration would prohibit attribution to Russia by the FBI at the same time that it was making that very same attribution via DHS and the ODNI.

<TEXT> To essentially guarantee taking control of the House in 2018, despite partisan gerrymandering, Democrats need just 5% of the electorate to change sides. This would create a +10% D swing. 5% of the electorate represents about 11% of the people who voted for Trump (and mostly straight-Republican tickets). 

So that's what who we should be focused on.

 Can we convince about 1 in 10 Trump voters (who aren't necessarily all die-hard Republicans) that this was a mistake? I think that's a highly achievable goal.      

Trump started with 45% approval and 45% disapproval in the Gallup poll. Now he's at 35% approval and 59% disapproval. That's a 10% decline in approval and a 14% increase in disapproval, for a 24% decrease in net approval. Surely we can find the required 5% of the electorate in that swing. </TEXT>

They're not going to help him with disastrous policies that aren't favored by Democrats or a majority of the American People. That's not their job. They're the *opposition* party.  If Trump can't even sell his agenda to Republicans, *why* should Democrats bail him out?

To top it off, Trump *hasn't even tried* to reach out with a more conciliatory tone or any sort of compromise. He's toxically unpopular, has no mandate, and is a pathological liar who can't be trusted with basically anything.

<TEXT> There's a large gulf between Democrats and Republicans on the economic intervention dimension. 

These 2D models based on the DW-nominate score show it really well:

[House](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/846092122763735042)

[Senate](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/846092374996652033)

[House w/ Freedom Caucus highlighted](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/846095467779969024)

The opportunity lies not so much in a new ideological consensus, but in the GOP's practical need to govern.

Republicans have a House majority of 237-193, with 5 vacancies, but without the 31 members of the FC, the GOP can't pass legislation if Democrats oppose it as well.  But to keep the legislation palatable to moderate Republicans, the learship can't make the concessions necessary to get the HFC to go along (HFC members are ideological maximalists who won't compromise and take something at the policy midpoint of the overall Republican causus). 

This sets up future scenarios like the epic fail of the AHCA. But if this Republican Congress gets nothing done despite unified control of DC, Republicans are fucked in 2018.

This gives the Democrats leverage if they maintain party loyalty. They can counter-propose something acceptable to their caucus and hold open an offer to negotiate in good faith from that starting position. If Trump or the Congressional GOP ask for too much, Democrats can credibly threaten to withdraw and leave them with their original conundrum. 

Republicans will then have to choose whether they want to be the do nothing Congress that couldn't govern with a majority (Dems will have a laundry list of policies that the GOP rejected to run on) or they can be a bipartisan achievement Congress. 

Democrats likely gain less in 2018 under the latter scenario. But, in return, they can actually get some policies they favorlike fixing and depoliticizing the ACAand making them part of the bipartisan consensus (like Social Security).

<TEXT> After wooing conservative Republicans on health care blew up in his face, President Trump is considering doing a total 180 and reaching out to congressional Democrats to get the rest of his agenda done.

...

Except, that's easier said than done. To have Democrats' ear, Trump will need to change pretty much everything about him  his tone, his substance, his policy  since he became president, say those very same Democrats in Congress.

"If he changes," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on ABC's "This Week," "he could have a different presidency."


...

[S]ince Trump got inaugurated, he's dropped his populist streak and taken a hard tact to the right: He endorsed a health-care plan Democrats despised for its tax breaks on the wealthy and loosening mandated coverage for the poor. After his White House put out a travel ban 2.0 when the first one was stopped by the courts, Trump said at a campaign rally he wished the first could have stayed in place.

"He moved so far to the hard right that it's virtually impossible for us to work with him," Schumer said on ABC.

Then there's his cross-aisle negotiating style: Democrats say it's nonexistent.

To date, the White House has had substantial conversations with Democrats exactly zero times, top Democratic aides say. A classic example: Democrats found out about the White House's intention to work with them by watching Trump aides on TV Sunday, not by a phone call from the West Wing.

If Trump does call them up, Democrats feel like they have leverage to draw some red lines. Since controlling the House of Representatives, Republicans have not passed not one major piece of legislation without help from Democrats. Which means if Trump does decide that working with Democrats is his best path for an elusive legislative accomplishment, it could cost him dearly.

<TEXT> I'd have fewer problems with Gorsuch if Garland had been confirmed and an open seat came up during a Republican President's term. We expect a more conservative judge. That's how the system works and maintains a semblance of balance over time. If a previously Republican seat comes up during a Democratic Presidency, oh well. The reverse happened several times under Reagan and yielded a considerably more conservative SCOTUS. But when Republicans refuse to even consider a qualified centrist judge during a Democratic President's term in order to transfer the vacancy so that a later Republican President so they can make the appointment, that balance breaks down. There was no reason not to consider Garland other than pure partisanship. Republicans should expect a proportional response.

Assuming they do have the votes to nuke it, they're also going to have to live with the consequences of a 51-vote threshold in the future. Moreover, if they do have the votes, what would stop them from nuking it on the next nomination, assuming Democrats find it unacceptable? In all likelihood, the next nomination would allow conservatives to realize long-dreamed-of goals, like overturning *Roe*. The filibuster is basically already braindead in a deep coma. It's just waiting for someone to deliver the *coup de grace* by pulling the plug. It's an illusory procedural protection unless actually invoked and respected by the other side. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Putting aside the open question of Trump's legitimacy to even make this appointment, Gorsuch is to the right of Scalia and Alito and will be part of the same radical right-wing project to expand corporate power, curtail the regulatory functions of the federal government, break organized labor, weaken consumer legal protections, and undermine women's reproductive choices. He has exceptional qualifications and an affable demeanor, but that doesn't outweigh the former.

Beyond the merits of Gorsuch himself, there has to be a [proportional retaliatory response](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mygn5/mcconnell_not_following_confirmation_process_he/dc7sth4) to the theft of Garland's seat.  Garland was a centrist consensus choice suggested by Republicans themselves. (Here, there was no consultation with Democrats.) And he was relatively old by the standard of recent nominations, meaning hed be on the court for less time.  It didnt matter. Republicans refused to consider him for 310 days, which is almost three times as long as the previous longest time between nomination and final action since we instituted a 9-justice SCOTUS in 1869 (127 days for Justice Harlan). 

If you consider SCOTUS nominations after 1869, the average is 34.80 days and the median is 19 days from nomination to final action.

If you look at just look at nominations after 1900, you get 37.67 on average, with a median of 23 days.

If you start with Eisenhower, you get 60.82 days on average, with 65 days median.

Since Reagan, it's been 65.93 average, 71 median.

Excluding Harriet Miers, who was withdrawn largely due to Republican pressure on President Bush, here are the nominations sorted by the number of days waiting before final action during that last period:


----

1. Sandra Day O'Connor	33

2. Ruth Bader Ginsburg	50

3. John Roberts, Jr. (C.J.)	62

4. Anthony Kennedy	65

5. Sonia Sotomayor	66

6. David Souter	69

7. Stephen Breyer	73

8. Samuel Alito, Jr.	82

9. Antonin Scalia	85

10. Elena Kagan	87

11. William Rehnquist (C.J.)	89

12. Clarence Thomas	99

13.  (*Not confirmed*) Robert Bork	108

14. (***NOT EVEN CONSIDERED***) **Merrick Garland	310**

----

Bork is instructive. Republicans bitch about him incessantly. But Bork was denied confirmation by a bipartisan 58-42 vote. 

[6 Republican Senators voted against him](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/senate-s-roll-call-on-the-bork-vote.html) --

John Chafee (R-RI)

Bob Packwood (R-OR)

Arlen Specter (R-PA)

Robert Stafford (R-VT)

John Warner (R-VA)

Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-CT)

This isn't the same as filibustering Bork, let alone *refusing to even consider* his nomination for 10 monthswhich is what actually occurred with Garland. *And remember*: Bork was the guy who fired Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor, in Nixons Saturday Night Massacre. That alone warranted rejecting him.

So this isn't petty squabbling. It's strategic deterrence. If Democrats ignore each Republican defection from the standing norms and continue to be nice as they're trampled on, they reward and encourage further gamesmanship. So you get a ratcheting effect where Republicans take more and more advantage and are never held to account. By retaliating and creating the expectation that every action has consequences, Republicans may think twice in the future.

<TEXT> Good news:

Senate Democrats on Tuesday left Judge Neil Gorsuch with two roads to the Supreme Court: winning over all of the partys remaining swing votes, or relying on the so-called nuclear option.

**The five Democratic senators up for reelection next year in states where President Donald Trump won by single digits have all endorsed a filibuster of Gorsuch**, while the five facing voters next year in states Trump won by double digits all remain undecided. **Gorsuch would have to carry all five of those fence-sitters to overcome a Democratic filibuster  plus his home-state Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Maine independent Sen. Angus King, and another more surprising senator.**

But after liberals raised the pressure on Democrats to oppose Gorsuch and the National Rifle Association targeted four red-state Democrats with $1 million in pro-Gorsuch ads, Trumps nominee ended the day with his chances at beating a filibuster lower than ever.

The issue is whether Gorsuch has earned 60 votes, which according to our Republican friends, has always been the standard for a significant decision by the Senate  and at present, I dont think theyre even close, liberal Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told Politico. So I dont see this as being a make-or-break determination for any of those red-state Democrats.

...

If Gorsuch ultimately wins over Donnelly, McCaskill, Heitkamp, Tester and Manchin, as well as Bennet or King, his 60th vote would have to come from a blue-state institutionalist such as Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)  who faced ire from the left for suggesting over the weekend that he might oppose a filibuster  or California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Judiciary Committees top Democrat.

I'm going to work on Feinstein. Others should do the same in their states.

<TEXT> You're shifting the goalposts bit. 

My criticism of your statement was that it was "over-broad and cynical."

Let's break it down:

[1] **No one** in [a] ***Congress*** or the [b] ***White House*** or [c] ***SCOTUS*** has [2] **worked for the American people** in a [3] **long time**. (emphasis and numeration added)

As evidence you offer this:


 [Obama] **[s]old out** the **entire VFX industry** by refusing to lodge complaints regarding our "allies" violating our trade agreements and kicking back money to the movie and game industry to ship jobs to Canada, England, and India. (emphasis added)

I'm not even sure that VFX products are fully subject to WTO rules that apply primarily to tangible goods. But let's  assume they are and stipulate that your claim is true, for the sake of argument. (I assume you're referring to [something related to this story, BTW.]
(http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/wto-cvd-duties-visual-effects-1200568359/)) 

You said that Congress, the President and SCOTUS hasn't worked for the American People for a long time. 
But surely you recognize that the VFX industry is not the *entirety* of the American People. There are always comparative winners and losers to government policies. If you name me any President who you contend worked for the American People as a whole, I'm willing to bet I can find find a sub-group that wasn't particularly well-served. 

Yet, if you look at macroeconomic indicators, like unemployment, job growth, etc., it's clear that Obama "worked for the American people" broadly speaking and compares favorably with many of his predecessors:

<TEXT> No, using the term "allegedly" indicates a respect for due process and the presumption of innocence. 

Likewise, "reportedly" indicates that a claim is or is contained in someone else's account (which should be cited) rather than being a firsthand account. 

Using these terms shows careful reporting. 

And finally, there are perfectly legitimate reasons for using anonymous sourcing. Look at how eager the Trump Regime is to find the leakers. Do you think they'd not have fired and prosecuted them if their identities were known publicly? When evaluating an anonymous source, you've gotta look at the context and whether you trust the reporter and publication's track record to help you decide whether the anonymity is justified.

I'm not clear on how you think a new vote would be somehow less tainted than the last one. The result of Russia's involvement is that a shitload of (allegedly true) info about Hillary got dumped onto Wikileaks. That can't be undone.

No the disclosure can't be undone, but the fact that the information was selectively leaked is material, and would now be know. 

Likewise, the fact that it was Russia doing it to help Trump is material. 

If Trump knew that Russia leaking the info, that's also material, since he denied it even as [he lied about and exaggerated the content of the leaks](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-trump-made-russias-hacking-more-effective/511880/).  

And, of course, if the leaks took place in direct coordination with the Trump campaign, as part of a quid pro quo, that's certainly material. 

Having a vote after disclosure of these material facts would go a long way to removing the taint because it would permit people put the illegally-obtained information in context. 

It doesn't matter if Clinton wins, or if she even runs. But even if she did run, I think it's highly plausible that disclosure of these facts could change the outcome, as would time and distance from the improper Comey letter. Remember, the election was decided by a swing of about 38.8K votes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the beauties of the document you purport to revere is its own acknowledgement that it's a work in progress, subject to further perfection and capable of being amended in order to do so. In the 1788 Constitution, Blacks could be consigned to the status of chattel and counted as 3/5ths of a person. Women couldn't vote. People who could be sent to war also couldn't vote to have a say in it. And States could deny federal constitutional rights to their citizens with impunity. 

We've fixed those deficiencies--some at very great cost.

We can continue to improve our Union, and the Constitution--being a product of reason and the enlightenment--invites us to.

<TEXT> Sure I would. And that didn't happen here. 

I didn't say it did. I'm trying to isolate, by analogy, what your problem with a re-vote.

You can't recall someone just for being an asshole.

Agreed.

If it turns out he broke the law, impeach him, but then Pence would take over.

If you got your wish and the vote was recast, then what exactly would be different? The information Wikileaks shared on Hillary would still be out there. You couldn't ask the voters to just "pretend it didn't happen".

Trump won the election in part because of several million pissed off voters, finding out he colluded with Russia is not going to magically make them less pissed off.

Impeachment would be fine if Trump were removed for something he did while in office, or for something that he did before the election that did not affect the election outcome directly. Pence would have an indisputable constitutional claim to the Presidency in such a situation if he was not a culpable participant.

But if Trump is removed for collusion with the Kremlin to subvert the election itself, then Pence would be a product of the same tainted election and thus illegitimate even if he didn't know about the collusion (though he likely would have known). 

Think about what the worst case scenario looks like (assuming many of the current allegations are proven). 

You'd have:

(1) a candidate for President of the U.S. agreeing with a foreign adversary 

(2) to unlawfully obtain information about his opponent and then wage a disinformation and propaganda campaign through selective disclosure of the opponent's dirty laundry, coupled with fake news stories to weaponize the disinformation and bots to promote it on social media, as well as covert funding of the campaign and possibly side payments and bribes (this is the ***quid***)

(3) in exchange for (***pro***) U.S. government policies favorable to the foreign adversary, and detrimental to U.S. national security interests (e.g., weakening NATO) (this is the ***quo***)

(4) *while* lying to the electorate about the existence of this agreement, which is itself unlawful, and falsely denying the foreign adversary's involvement in the election--even when the opponent explicitly brings up the issue

(5) *while* shamelessly and knowingly mischaracterizing, exaggerating, and otherwise playing up the significance of illegally-obtained information about the opponent

(6) *while* the opponent continues to abide by campaign finance, anti-bribery and other legal restrictions that the candidate is circumventing through the unlawful agreement.

Now, keep in mind that the candidate won: 

1. Michigan by 10,704 votes (0.22%);

2. Wisconsin by 22,748 votes (0.76%); and

3. Pennsylvania by 44,292 (0.72%).

Trump's combined margin in these decisive states was, 77,744, or 0.0569% of the 136,628,459 votes cast. 

So a swing of 5,353 MI, 11,375 WI, and 22,147 PA undecided voters from Trump to Clinton--**less than three hundredths of a percentage point nationally**--would have changed the outcome. 



The point isn't to give the election to Clinton. It's to hold an untainted election. 

It's possible that Trump could win again. If that's the People's will--at least as filtered by the EC--then fine. That would at least restore legitimacy. But it's highly plausible that the outcome could be different. And if it were, that would also be the People's will.

<TEXT> That's an interesting theory. 

I haven't done anywhere near a comprehensive review of the caselaw on executive privilege.

Fron what I know, though, there would likely be no executive privilege covering communications between an agent of the President and agents of a foreign government. The purpose of such communications isn't to advise the President and facilitate his decision-making. It's to negotiate or relay information between governments, for example, who may have interests adverse to the U.S. So disclosures outside the executive would ordinarily waive executive privilege. 

There still may be confidentiality or classification protecting such information from public disclosure based on national security concerns, or a limited privacy interest to the extent any of the communications did not involve official government actions. But Congress should presumably be able to access those communications as part of its oversight and investigatory roles, even if the statements are not made public.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that we'd probably be better off having a parliamentary system rather than a Presidential-Congrsssional system. Last week's healthcare debacle would have been a no-confidence vote in Trump's minority governmentpossibly triggering new elections. But the prospects of this kind of dramatic change in the short term are dim.

Here's [a post I made a while back suggesting comprehensive set of fundamental process reforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/52kzbg/comment/d7lgrsc).

Realistically, I think you'd do these kinds of reforms incrementally and see what you get from each reform.

First, go to a national popular vote for President and do something drastic to limit partisan gerrymandering in the House. That's essential.

Next, change from Plurality-SMD to mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) for the House.

Then abolish legislative filibusters and return to the constitutional 50%+1 rule in the Senate.

Those three reforms would make a huge difference, I think. We might gain a functioning government from it. 

But if you needed to go further, you could make the Senate more representative and/or implement asymmetric bicameralism (under which the Senate would mostly only be able to delay or raise the threshold for passing legislation). 

Then, if you still needed to go further, you could separate President's head of state role from the head of government role, and make the Speaker of the House the head of government and the cabinet. 

The main takeaway is that we should tinker with and improve our democratic processes. We've learned a lot since 1788.

<TEXT> So the Kremlin claims it was a meeting with Kushner the businessman, whereas the White House claims it was as a member of the Trump Regime's transition team.

I'm inclined to think itmay have been *both*, since each side would tend to want to conceal the purpose of the meeting that the other side claimed. Kushner and the White House would not want to exacerbate the conflicts of interest concerns that Kushner facing over not having divested from his family's business empire. The Kremlin, for its part, likely wouldn't want to call even more attention to undisclosed meetings between its agents and the Trump regime. Yet, the White House will likely want to portray those meetings as routine (even though they were undisclosed) and hope that the substance of what was actually discussed is unknown.

#####Kremlin:

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Tuesday that Kushner's meeting with Vnesheconombank (VEB) CEO Sergey Gorkov in late December "was ordinary business," echoing the bank's previous claim that it had met with Kushner in his capacity as "the head of Kushner companies."

...

"During the talks, the existing practices of foreign development banks and promising trends were discussed. ... The meetings took place with a number of representatives of the largest banks and business establishments of the United States, including Jared Kushner, the head of Kushner Companies."


----

#####White House:

That appears to conflict with the White House's version of events, which purports that Kushner met with Gorkov as a representative of the Trump transition team.

"Jared attended the meeting in his capacity as a transition official," a senior White House official told Business Insider on Tuesday. "Nothing of substance was discussed. There was no follow up."

The official added that the White House statement from Monday, that Kushner took the meetings as part of his role as "the official primary point of contact with foreign governments and officials," still stands.

...

The seemingly conflicting characterizations of the meeting, which was not disclosed publicly until Monday, raise more questions about what kind of contact Trump's associates had with Russian officials through the latter half of 2016, as Russia was attempting to sway the outcome of the election in Trump's favor.

Kushner also met with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, in December at Trump Tower with Gen. Michael Flynn. Kislyak set up the meeting between Kushner and Gorkov, according to The New York Times.

The circumstances surrounding Kushner's meetings with Gorkov are murky not only because its purpose remains unclear, but also because Vnesheconombank was sanctioned by the US in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea.

"It's an unusual/more significant meeting given that Vnesheconombank was on the sanctions list," Ian Bremmer, president of the political risk firm Eurasia Group, said in an email. "The obvious reason would be that they hoped for better treatment under the Trump administration." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This couldn't look worse for the WH. 

Read the letters back and forth about Yates' testimony. They establish that the WH's denials of this story are false. Then you have Nunes cancelling the House Intelligence Committee hearing *after* Yates' lawyer took the position that the WH's privilege assertions had no meritbasically stonewalling and siding with the people he's ostensibly investigating when their own attempt to stonewall failed. And now we learn from Schiff that Yates was going to be testifying about Flynn (and a potential cover up). 

To top all of this off, you have Nunes secretly getting classified intelligence from WH staffers only to then turn around and brief the WH publicly concerning that very same intelligence*while* withholding it from his Committee. Once again, defending and running interference for the very people he's supposed to be investigating (and in the process breaching all norms of acceptable behavior as the chair of a congressional oversight committee). 

We're quickly getting into obstruction of justice territory if we're not already there.

Republicans now have a choice: show some independence and carry out a legitimate investigationas overwhelming majorities of the public have indicated they wantor be branded the complicity-in-treason party. 

Democrats have mounted a pretty decent opposition so far. But it's time to kick it up a notch. Use every tool at your disposalincluding withholding unanimous consent in the Senateto force the GOP to investigate. Hold unofficial hearings and town halls. File lawsuits. Call for protests and direct action. Use state-level law enforcement tools. Kick and scream*literally* if necessary. Shut this thing down, because it can't go on like this.

<TEXT> Wow. The optics of this are terrible for the WH:

The Trump administration sought to block former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying to Congress in the House investigation of links between Russian officials and Donald Trumps presidential campaign, The Washington Post has learned, a position that is likely to further anger Democrats who have accused Republicans of trying to damage the inquiry.

According to letters The Post reviewed, the Justice Department notified Yates earlier this month that the administration considers a great deal of her possible testimony to be barred from discussion in a congressional hearing because the topics are covered by the presidential communication privilege.


...

In a March 23 letter to Acting Assistant Attorney General Samuel Ramer, Yatess attorney David ONeil described the governments position. **ONeil, who declined to comment, noted in the letter that Yates is willing to testify, and that she will avoid discussing classified information and details that could compromise investigations.** The correspondence was later shared with the Intelligence Committee.

**The Department of Justice has advised that it believes there are further constraints on the testimony Ms. Yates may provide at the [Intelligence Committee] hearing.** Generally, we understand that the department takes the position that all information Ms. Yates received or actions she took in her capacity as Deputy Attorney General and acting Attorney General are client confidences that she may not disclose absent written consent of the department, the lawyer wrote.

**We believe that the departments position in this regard is overbroad, incorrect, and inconsistent with the departments historical approach to the congressional testimony of current and former officials,** the letter continues. **In particular, we believe that Ms. Yates should not be obligated to refuse to provide non-classified facts about the departments notification to the White House of concerns about the conduct of a senior official.** Requiring Ms. Yates to refuse to provide such information is **particularly untenable given that multiple senior administration officials have publicly described the same events.**

Scott Schools, another Justice Department official, replied in a letter the following day, saying the conversations with the White House are likely covered by the presidential communications privilege and possibly the deliberative process privilege. The president owns those privileges. Therefore, to the extent Ms. Yates needs consent to disclose the details of those communications to [the intelligence panel], she needs to consult with the White House. She need not obtain separate consent from the department.

**Yatess attorney then sent a letter Friday to McGahn, the White House lawyer, saying that any claim of privilege has been waived as a result of the multiple public comments of current senior White House officials** describing the January 2017 communications. Nevertheless, I am advising the White House of Ms. Yates intention to provide information.

**That same day, Nunes, the panels chairman, said he would not go forward with the public hearing** that was to feature Yatess testimony. </TEXT>

Assume we're in the scenario where Trump's collusion with Putin has been proved in court, and the SCOTUS as a result declares the election null and void. Trump is removed from office and Paul Ryan becomes acting President until the special election can be held. Trump isn't personally convicted of treason so he's still eligible to run in the election. Even though the GOP denies him the nomination at a brokered convention, Trump decides to run again as an independent (or as a representative of the new Make America Great Party). The Democrats re-nominate Clinton, and the Republicans someone else (Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, Mike Pence, etc.).

Suppose new votes are cast and someone other than Trump wins.

<TEXT> Can't compose as full a reply as I'd like at the moment, but I'll say this in response to your points. 

(1) The very first sentence of my linked post was:

It's not that complicated actuallyjust **politically difficult.**

The original post I was responding to was about the purported need to amend the Constitution. Amending the Constitution is, in fact, not necessary.

In my reply, I was commenting on the legal viability of the proposed remedy to this legitimacy crisis (holding a new Presidential election), not the politics of its implementationwhich are also really interesting.

I will note that procedurally, overriding a veto would take 19 GOP Senators, the same as for a conviction on impeachment. The main difference is you'd *also* need 2/3ds of the House as well for a PSA amendment. 

If there had already been findings of collusion by Congressional committees such that impeachment was actually viable, this wouldn't necessarily be preemptive action or against medium-to-long-term GOP interests. 

---

(a) The order matters only because it would prevent Pence from ascending to the Presidency. If the impeachments are done in quick succession, it could also potentially prevent a Vice-Presidential nomination from being made and delivered, which would be cleaner. 

----

(b) The federal courts have broad equity jurisdiction under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution and could use it to annul the election in the appropriate circumstances (foreign subversion with culpable participation by the current President)especially with Congressional participation in the process.

From a prior post:


Suppose a Congressional investigation finds strong evidence of collusion with and possibly even direct funding by the Kremlin (which is currently [being investigated](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-russia-dossier-claims-cia-2017-1)). ... This would fundamentally taint the election and would be the basis for begining impeachment proceedings.  But another track that could be pursued in parallel, or in the alternative, would be a lawsuit contesting the validity of the election itself.

First, you'd need to find someone with standing to sue. An obvious person would be any of the other candidates who took part in the electionespecially Clinton. There would be other persons with standing as well. But the key point is that this is the sort of "[case or controversy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/controversy)" that federal courts have jurisdiction to resolve.

[Article III, Section 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section2) specifies, in the relevant part that:

The **judicial power shall extend to** ***all cases***, **in law and** ***equity***, arising under this Constitution [or] the laws of the United States...

[Federalist 83 (Hamilton)](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa83.htm) sheds further light on this broad and somewhat vague grant of jurisdiction:

"The **great and primary use of** a court of **equity is to give relief in extraordinary cases, which are exceptions to general rules.**"

Here, fully resolving the specific controversyan election tainted by foreign interferenceand fashioning an equitable remedy might well require complete annulment of the original election.

Either the suit contesting the election works its way up to SCOTUS through the regular appellate process or it makes it there in some expedited fashionsuch as through an [extraordinary writ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1651) application. In any event, the Congressional findings could be introduced and judicially-noticed (including any supporting classified evidence under seal). Trump would have full due process and opportunity to oppose via an adversarial legal proceeding. Ultimately though, let's assume the courts were to decide against him.

In theory, that would vacate both the Presidency and Vice-Presidency and void any acts involving the President since the inauguration. It would also trigger the Presidential Succession Act (PSA), which provides directlyby statutefor who will "act as President" when there's no President and no Vice President.

...

There's [some precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_States\)) for passing legislation and involving the Supreme Court to resolve disputes about a Presidential election through extraordinary remedies. In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes "won" the election against Samuel Tilden by 1 EV under a [negotiated compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1877). **Hayes did not have a majority of the electoral vote until this compromise.** Tilden won an outright majority of the popular vote, not just a plurality. The margin was 3%the largest popular vote margin for an EC loser. This was possibly the most divisive election in American history. So it's not totally inconceivable that a bipartisan solution could happen here too if it's seen as being in both parties' interests.

<TEXT> If you nullified, that's only half of the equation. It would mean that the Office of President and Vice President would be vacant. That would automatically trigger the Presidential Succession Act (PSA). Under the current PSA, Ryan would be acting President until a President is elected.

The idea is you pre-amend the PSA to authorize a special election to fill double vacancies. So Ryan would act as a caretaker until that occurs.

But the same judicial order that nullified the election could simply require a new election. That would be more like a re-vote.

<TEXT> A murder suspect accused of coming to New York to kill as many black men as he could will face trial on charges of terrorism, according to New York County District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.

On Monday, James Harris Jackson, 28, of Baltimore was indicted Monday on one count each of first- and second-degree murder as an act of terrorism for the March 20 stabbing of Timothy Caughman, 66.

I'm searching for the indictment. This notable both because I'd expect a federal terrorism charge, whereas this is brought by a state prosecutor, and because [Sean Spicer refused to condemn the act as such](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/spicer-won-acknowledge-timothy-caughman-murder-hate-crime-article-1.3010710).

<TEXT> I think that's a pretty messed up view of popular sovereignty. 

An election isn't a game. It's mechanism to gauge the will of the People, and by their consent, invest the winner with powers that belong permanently to the People. 

A re-vote simply measures the will of the People again when there's a significant problem with the original measurement (such as the People's consent being procured by fraud and in willful violation of election lawsincluding the [prohibition on foreign campaign donations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121)).

So what if the People make a different choice under this extraordinary situation? The point is to obtain their consent, not freeze a particular slice of their opinion in time. There's nothing magical about a specific election day. It's more important that the election be free and fair, whenever it's held.

Would you be OK with holding a re-vote if there were a major natural disaster or a coordinated terrorist attack on election day affecting turnout in several key battlegeound states? 

If so, then why should deliberate interference by a foreign adversary targetting the election itselfwith possible collusion by one of the candidatesbe any different?         </TEXT>

The simplest way would be to (1) amend the Presidential Succession Act to provide for a special election, and then (2) create a dual vacancy of the Presidency and Vice-Presidency by: (a) impeaching Pence and Trump in that order; or by (b) judicially annuling the election and vacating both offices.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> 

This complaint is newsworthy, but it can't force action on this.

Normally, the [U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc) would have prosecutorial jurisdiction over lying to Congress. He would empanel a grand jury and present evidence of Sessions having perjured himself. The grand jury would presumably indict Sessions, and then there would be a criminal trial. 

*Complicating factor*: U.S. Attorneys are subordinates of Sessions, as Attorney General and head of the Department of Justice. It would be difficult for a U.S. Attorney to press charges against his own boss. A U.S. Attorney can be fired basically at will by the A.G. or the President, [as we've seen](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/us/politics/us-attorney-justice-department-trump.html). Of course, doing so can be scandalous under some circumstances, just [ask George W. Bush and Alberto Gonzales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_of_U.S._attorneys_controversy). (We [may not even have to go that far back](https://www.propublica.org/article/preet-bharara-fired-investigating-tom-price-hhs-stock-trading).) It would be even more scandalous here since Sessions would be firing someone investigating his own wrongdoing, ala Nixon's [Saturday Night Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre). As we've seen though, Trump doesn't respect norms.

So, it'd basically be an "[if you come at the king, you'd best not miss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-lrftLQaQ)" situation.

Assuming these issues could be resolved, two crimes Sessions could theoretically be charged with are:

---

[18 U.S. Code  1001](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001) (False statements)

*Or*

[18 U.S. Code  1621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621) (Perjury) 

---

If I were prosecuting him, the way I'd go about it is by juxtaposing Sessions' in-person and written testimony against (1) the timeline (he failed to correct his testimony for weeks, even after Flynn resigned for lying while not under oath), (2) his [initial press statements](https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/837136512915501056), (3) the [trial balloon excuses that have subsequently unraveled](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5y3kfs/al_franken_i_think_jeff_sessions_committed_perjury/den0ga6/), (4) the [doubling down](http://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/judiciary/upload/Sessions,%2003-06-17,%20letter,%20testimony.pdf) after being scolded by Trump, and (5) the [subsequent revelation that he met with Kislyak a third time](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58c05639e4b0d1078ca37225/), which boxes him in.

I'd look for further inconsistencies in what he said at his recusal press conference versus at the hearing and supplemental letter. And I'd also play the [extended cut of his body language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOh3kfulSoU feature=youtu.be) (1:35). 

In addition, I'd bring in Sessions' past statements about perjury (such as during Clinton's impeachment trial) and apply them to the situation as evidence of the standard of forthrightness that he expected of others and would presumably try to comply with. 

Here's the relevant statutory provision, [18 U.S. Code  1621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621):

-----

Whoever

(1) **having taken an oath** before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, **that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true**, **willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true**; or

(2) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;

is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.

----

The point is to convince a jury of his **reckless, knowing, or purposeful** *subscription* to his false statements of material fact.

Put differently, Sessions swore an oath that the testimony he gave was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Perjury liability attaches to that affirmation, not to the underlying lie. The lie just shows that the affirmation was false. He had a chance to correct or clarify it but instead doubled down.     

----

Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger! It's very generous. I'm glad you found this comment informative.

Republicans almost certainly will respond by using their majority status to change Senate procedure and allow Supreme Court picks to be confirmed with a simple majority vote, Coons told MSNBCs Morning Joe.

...

Coonss prediction came after recent consultations with senators in both parties about brokering an agreement that would lead to Gorsuchs confirmation and also preserve current Senate traditions, according to multiple senators and aides familiar with his negotiations.

The hope was to find a bipartisan group of rank-and-file senators who could negotiate a deal that would once again steer the Senate away from partisan brinkmanship on federal court vacancies. A group of 14 senators from both parties warded off a similar impasse in 2005  but just three members of that Gang of 14 remain in office. And Coons signaled Monday that hes found little appetite for a new agreement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, you can use an automatic formula applied by a computer, but you still need someone to look at the taxes or other financial documents and verify that the self-reported number matches. Then you have people benefiting from understating their income to the IRS or purposely working less to remain eligible for benefits. And there's additional processing time. It's not impossible to run a means test that axtually saves money. My only point is that it saves *less* money than a simple reduction of benefits calculation would suggest, because the means-test entails several unavoidable burdens. This is fairly basic [public finance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_finance) economics.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The means-test needs to be enforced. If you have a graduated phase-out versus a hard cutoff (which you should, because hard cut-offs create perverse incentives), you have to calculate and periodically update the proportional reduction in the benefit. From experience, I can tell you that obtaining parents' tax returns can also be a huge hassle. And all of the additional paperwork needs to be processed, driving up administrative costs. As someone else pointed out, children estranged from their parents or whose parents simply don't want to provide the help can get screwed too.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. Means-testing and enforcing restrictions cost money and resources. So you don't ever get the theoretical maximum savings from imposing the means-test. Plus, removing universal eligibility reduces buy-in from the people who are paying a disproprotional amount to fund the social programs. When we're all in it together, everyone wants to make it work better because we all use it. Go to a city where public transportation is used by everyone and compare it to one where it's only used by the pooryou'll instantly see what I mean. This is frequently the difference between something being seen as a public benefit that you pay for as compared to *welfare for those other people*. It's a large part of why Social Security and Medicare are so popular. They are *earned benefits*. These programs also represent an inter-generational pact that enhances solidarity and social cohesion. Working age people pay for their elders, who, in turn, paid for their elders when they were working. We need the same thing with younger people. We all pay for their education now so that they can pay for our dignified retirement later. These links between generations make our county stronger.

Also: 

This may be an unpopular opinion, but we have to raise **middle class taxes** to pay for this too. Although tax rates should probably be more progressive, raising taxes *only* on millionaires will lead to a much more volatile revenue stream (in addition to the lack of buy-in discussed above). If the idea is to have the government pay for higher education for everyone in order to create a more equal opportunity for anyone to go to college, everyone should pay a bit more. We're providing a social good so it doesn't depend on private ability to payso everyone in society should contribute to that. You get a bit less take home pay to use on whatever you want, but you and your kids can go to college without being saddled with debtand you don't have to save for college anymore. You can instead save to start a business or buy a house, or whatever else you want to do.

<TEXT> It'd have to go a whole lot further than just the House Freedom Caucus; it's tough to see all but the most moderate of House and Senate Republicans voting for a single-payer plan. 

I recognize that there's a large gulf between Democrats and Republicans on the economic intervention dimension. 

These 2D models based on the DW-nominate score show it really well:

[House](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/846092122763735042)

[Senate](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/846092374996652033)

[House w/ Freedom Caucus highlighted](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/846095467779969024)

The opportunity lies not so much in a new ideological consensus, but in the GOP's practical need to govern.

Republicans have a majority of 237-193, with 5 vacancies, but without the 31 members of the FC, the GOP can't pass legislation if Democrats oppose it as well.  But to keep the legislation palatable to moderate Republicans, the learship can't make the concessions necessary to get the HFC to go along (HFC members are ideological maximalists who won't compromise and take something at the policy midpoint of the overall Republican causus). 

This sets up future scenarios like the epic fail of the AHCA. But if this Congress gets nothing done despite unified control of DC, Republicans are fucked in 2018.

This gives the Democrats leverage if they maintain party loyalty. They can counter-propose something acceptable to their caucus and hold open an offer to negotiate in good faith from that starting position. If the GOP ask for too much, Democrats can credibly threaten to withdraw and leave Republicans with their original conundrum. 

Republicans will then have to choose whether they want to be the do nothing Congress that couldn't govern with a majority (Dems will have a laundry list of policies that the GOP rejected to run on) or they can be a bipartisan achievement Congress. 

Democrats likely gain less in 2018 under the latter scenario. But, in return, they can actually get some policies they favorlike fixing and depoliticizing the ACA, which would make it part of the consensus (like Social Security).

<TEXT> This circular firing squad and inability to govern is just adding gasoline to the raging dumpster fire.

Republicans' blame game for their failure to pass a health-care bill is in full swing. And  in a sharp contrast from Friday, when he pointed the finger at Democrats  President Trump is turning his fire at his own party.

...

It's a mixed message, to say the least. On Saturday night, Trump took to Twitter to urge people to watch Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, who subsequently proceeded, on her show, to tear into House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and demand that he resign. (Both Pirro and Trump's top aides said there was no coordination on the matter.)

On Friday, as Republicans were pulling a bill they just couldn't build a coalition for, Trump didn't even mention his own party. Hey, we could have done this, he told WaPo's Bob Costa as he announced that the Republicans had pulled the bill. But we couldnt get one Democrat vote, not one.

Then, the New York Times Magazine reports Sunday that at one point during the negotiations, Trump told Rep. Charlie Dent (Pa.), the leader of the moderate GOP Tuesday Group caucus: I'm going to blame you if the bill fails. In an interview Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, Dent did not deny the conversation.

But of all of Trump's finger-pointing, the one aimed at the conservative faction of his party feels the most notable.

Trump's admission that the hard-liners didn't come around suggests that he may be forced to recognize the limits of his dealmaking abilities. He spent the past few weeks courting these conservatives, hosting them at the White House several times. At one point, he even bragged that a lot of the no's had flipped to yes's.  

In the end, he didn't turn enough. Neither Trump nor Republican leaders could win over about a dozen of the 35-40 House Freedom Caucus members. Many of them wanted a repeal of Obamacare  something Republican leaders said they couldn't do under budget rules  or nothing at all.

Establishment Republicans' simmering frustration with the conservative wing of their party is nothing new. The caucus has successfully thwarted budget deals and immigration proposals.

...

But the fact that Republicans' frustration has broken out into open warfare is a new development  and a sign of just how much the party is smarting from their health-care loss.

<TEXT> Destruction evidence can be very serious for other reasons. You can, of course, bring charges based on the cover up itself. These are often easier to prove. But just as importantly, if destruction is proven, it can be the basis for an evidentiary sanction called an [adverse inference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_inference). 

Basically, when evidence has been destroyed and is no longer available, the fact finder is permitted to infer from the destruction that the evidence would have established the  damning fact it would have been introduced to prove. 

Also, if the evidence later turns up through data recovery or another source, destruction can establish intent and weigh in favor of a more culpable interpretation when ambiguous evidence is susceptible to multiple possible meanings.

<TEXT> Can you imagine Trump going before the Democratic caucus to take questions, and not only defending specific policy features of the bill, but asking for their support and suggestions?  


Obama legitimately tried to get Republicans onboard. He made concessions that weakened the bill from what Democrats might have liked to be, only for Republicans (notably Sen. Grassley) to yank the football away and make more demands. Only when it became abundantly clear that they weren't negotiating in good faith did Democrats pass the bill on a party-line vote (without stripping out the concessions). 

There couldn't be a starker difference in the processes that produced the ACA vs. the AHCA. Ultimately, a better process produced a better product. That's a huge part of why the AHCA failed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even as he thrust himself and the trappings of his office into selling the health-care bill, Trump peppered his aides again and again with the same concern, usually after watching cable news reports chronicling the setbacks, according to two of his advisers: Is this really a good bill?

In the end, the answer was no  in part because the president himself seemed to doubt it.

...

For Trump, it was never supposed to be this hard. As a real estate mogul on the rise, he wrote Art of the Deal, and as a political candidate, he boasted that nobody could make deals as beautifully as he could. Replacing Obamacare, a Republican bogeyman since the day it was enacted seven years ago, was Trumps first chance to prove that he had the magic touch that he claimed eluded Washington.

But Trumps effort was plagued from the beginning. The bill itself would have violated a number of Trumps campaign promises, driving up premiums for millions of citizens and throwing millions more off health insurance  including many of the working-class voters who gravitated to his call to make America great again. Trump was unsure about the American Health Care Act, though he ultimately dug in for the win, as he put it.

There were other problems, too. Trump never made a real effort to reach out to Democrats, and was unable to pressure enough of his fellow Republicans. He did not speak fluently about bills details and focused his pitch in purely transactional terms. And he failed to appreciate the importance of replacing Obamacare to the Republican base; for the president, it was an obstacle to move past to get to taxes, trade and the rest of his agenda.

Trumps advisers thought he could nudge the bill over the finish line by sheer force of personality. He is the closer, White House press secretary Sean Spicer boasted on Wednesday.

**But by Friday it was clear that the closer could not close.** </TEXT>

Edit: 

Here's why Trump's "blame the Democrats" strategy will likely fail.

[President Obama on McConnell's successful hack of the basic accountability mechanism under the American Presidential-Congressional system](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/obama-reckons-with-a-trump-presidency?mbid=social_twitter):

"Some of this is really simple and its the thing that **Mitch McConnell figured out on Day One of my Presidency**, which is **people arent paying that close attention to how Washington works**, he said. They know there are lobbyists, special interests, gridlock; that the powerful have more influence and access than they do. And **if things arent working, if theres gridlock, then the only guy that they actually know is supposed to be in charge and supposed to be helping them is the President.** And so the very deliberate strategy that Mitch **McConnell and the Republican Party** generally employed during the course of my Presidency was effective. What they **understood was that, if you embraced old-fashioned dealing, trading, horse-trading, bipartisan achievement, people feel better. And, if people feel better, then they feel better about the Presidents party, and the Presidents party continues. And, if it feels broken, stuck, and everybody is angry, then that hurts the President or the Presidents party.**"   

I like to call this **McConnell's Law**. 

It can be distilled as:

People who swing and decide elections don't pay as close attention to politics as those who read this sub. They will blame the President and his party when things don't work. The effect is magnified when the President's party controls Congress and when the President is unpopular. The exceptions are few and far between.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol. I'm saying that this is what I personally would've advised him to do, in light of the political reality that he started off with an exceptionally weak mandate and desparate need to expand his minority coalition.  He thinks he won a tremendous victory and was robbed of a popular vote win by 3-5 million illegals. But he didn't. His first problem is earning popular support. 

Now, I'd never nominate Gorsuch. But if I did, it would be as my second move, to replace Ginsberg or Kennedy. Likewise, I'm not a populist or nationalist. I wouldn't push protectionism, mass deportations, border walls, or symbolic feelz over realz Muslim bans. But if I *did* want those things, I'd realize that I needed significant political capital to pull them off. The moves I suggested would build that up while dividing the opposition.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are distinct and not related in any way. I'm not arguing that they are. Preponderance of the evidence is the standard for establishing civil liability. Probable cause is used in the investigatory and preliminary adjudicatory phases of criminal proceedings. It also potentially comes up with evidentiary exclusion during a criminal trial or appeal. It isn't a burden of proof for the accused's ultimate criminal liability. 

Yet, if you reason these standards through, it's pretty clear that a prosecutor shouldn't seek an indictment or continue to pursue a case where it isn't more likely than notat least in the prosecutor's mind, having considered all the evidence available (including exculpatory evidence)that a crime was committed by the accused. This is not so different than a fact-finder reviewing all the evidence presented by both a plaintiff and defendant during a civil trial, and concluding that the defendant is more likely liable than not. 

Again, I'm talking about logical valence and scope, *not* how prosecutors apply the standard in practice (especially when they're elected officials).      </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me push back just a bit. I agree that it's fairly easy--probably too easy--for a skilled prosecutor to get an indictment out of a grand jury. 

With that said, I'd take some issue with this:

It is not the task of a grand jury to determine whether someone is guilty, the task is to determine whether the prosecutor can demonstrate that the accused 'might be guilty', and that they're not unfairly being brought to trial by an overzealous prosecutor.

The evidence needed to convict in a Jury Trial is 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. This is much higher quality of evidence than 'probable cause'.

Regardless of whether "might be guilty" is the standard grand juries are *actually* applying, it certainly isn't probable cause. Probable cause is--or at least is supposed to be--a preponderance of evidence that convinces a reasonably prudent person that a crime was probably committed. To put it really crudely, it's being more than 50% certain. "Beyond a reasonable doubt" would be something like 90-95% certain. 

If Schiff is saying that there's *genuine* probable cause here--not just merely enough evidence for a prosecutor to manipulate a grand jury into indicting--it would mean that **the most reasonable interpretation of the evidence available is that there was collusion** (granting that other reasonable possibilities had not yet been excluded).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. 

Trump blew a huge opportunity. He could've said: it's wrong to play political games with SCOTUS nominees, and renominated Garland. This would not only have disarmed the Democrats and won him moderate support, but it would have set up a powerful argument if there were another vacancy during his termwhich he could fill with anyone he wanted, including Gorsuch. And he'd likely have more goodwill going into his other agenda items, rather than a unified and mobilized Democratic Party. 

Same thing with the Trumpcare/Republicare bill. Trump campaigned on better coverage for less money. He could've outflanked the opposition from the left by proposing basic single-payer with private add-on coverage. He could then have called Obama on his promise to support something cheaper that covered more people. Obama has integrity and would likely support this plan, which would, in turn, free Dems to back it. He could then accomplish a full repeal and replace of the ACA, fulfilling a key campaign promise. The best part: Trumpcare wouldn't be an epithet.

If Trump had done these things, he'd be sitting on 55-60% approval, which would put him in a great position to pursue the rest of his agenda and fortify him against the Russia investigation. Instead, we have this rapidly sinking ship, with no one at the helm.

<TEXT> ...Republican state Rep. Phil Covarrubias seemed to argue that the use of internment camps was justified.

We keep hearing about how things went down with the Japanese people. For anybody that has never been in the heat of combat, when the **Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor** and all of that was going on, **theres no time to ask questions and find out who's a citizen and whos not**," Covarrubias said. "You don't have that moment in time. You need to regroup. It's easy to sit up here and say this stuff now. But if you're in that moment, it looks a lot different than being able to be in a nice suit and tie."

He continued: *I hear people saying that we need to respect other peoples rights**, and I agree with that, **but what about them respecting our rights and our country and our laws**? Because I'm not hearing that up here.

Later on in the hearing, Covarrubias once again seemed to defend the mass internment of Japanese American citizens by pointing out that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack, he said, was "what happened prior... that kicked all this off."

"I think we need to look at the Americans that are in fear from the terrorism and the things that weve seen over the last few years especially," Covarrubias said. "Everybody's talking about the immigrants being in fear or the other people being in fear. What about our own people? What about Florida? What about San Bernardino? ... We need to take care of our home here and realize that we have plenty of our own citizens  citizens  that are in fear."

Covarrubias did not immediately return a message left with his office Thursday morning. **His "them vs. our" arguments throughout the hearing appeared to ignore the fact that the majority of the people of Japanese descent forced into internment camps in the 1940s were U.S. citizens.**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, Clinton did nowhere close to the same thing. Accepting donations to the Clinton Foundationa highly rated charityis not the same as accepting illicit Russian assistance with *the election itself* in exchange for pro-Putin policies. 

[This fact check puts the whole thing in context](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/07/fact-checking-donations-clinton-foundation/).

Yeah, there's a potential that such donations could create an apparent conflict of interest down the line if Clinton had to make decision adversely affecting Saudi Arabia. Even so, it would be an attenuated conflict, since it wasn't a contribution to Clinton or her campaign, and she did not solicit the donation.

With Putin-Trump affair, on the other hand, the allegation is of an explicit *quid pro quo*, where the Kremlin agrees to release the hacked DNC and Podesta emails to Wikileaks in exchange for Trump weakening the GOP platform on Ukraine, undermining NATO, and other pro-Putin commitmentspossibly even with some campaign funding or other bribes to sweeten the deal. 

This is totally illegal.

[52 U.S. Code  30121](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121-) (Contributions and donations by foreign nationals) provides:

------------

**(a) Prohibition**

**It shall be unlawful for**

**(1) a foreign national,** ***directly or indirectly,*** **to make**

**(A) a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election;**

(B) a contribution or donation to a committee of a political party; or

**(C) an expenditure, independent expenditure, or disbursement for an electioneering communication (within the meaning of section 30104(f)(3) of this title)**; or

**(2) a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) from a foreign national.**

----------


If proven, the allegation of direct collusion with Putin under a *quid pro quo* would be the biggest scandal in American history and would warrant annuling the entire tainted election.

Take a step back and think about what we're talking about here: soliciting or receiving from the Kremlin, in exchange for policies desired by Putin, material assistance in the form of unlawfully hacked information and/or illegal campaign contributions in furtherance of a plan to harm Clinton and aid Trump in an election for President of the United States. The policies desired by Putin allegedly include weakening of NATO, the U.S.'s principal military alliance, and an easing of U.S. sanctions for Putin's invasion of Crimea. 

I can scarcely think of a more serious charge.

The agreement to subvert our election would likely satisfy the "**adherence to the enemy**" element of treason (which could be further inferred from the delivery of pro-Putin policies detrimental to U.S. national security and use of the hacked information knowing that it was unlawfully obtained and disclosed under this illicit deal). Enacting pro-Putin policies and speaking favorably of Putin would likely establish the overt act of "**aid and comfort**". Russia has long been an adversarial power, and the act of subverting our democratic election to promote its objectives and weaken our principal defensive military alliance (and consequently, the U.S.' ability to "resist or to attack [its] enemies") would likely be sufficient to establish **emnity**. So if you had **two witnesses**, you might even be able to convict for treason in the strict [18 U.S.C.  2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) sense. *See generally* [*Cramer v.

<TEXT> I agree that it hinges on whether Russia can be considered an enemy. But I think there's [a colorable case to be made that subverting the election to benefit Russia could be treason](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/60yh2f/z/dfark64) even if there was no state of war.

The rarity of treason convictions since WWII may not come from the lack of a war. Rather, it likely stems from the relative procedural difficulty of proving treason in light of the two-witness requirement. Why would a prosecutor charge treason when they can obtain a conviction far more easily for something like espionage (as with the Rosenbergs) but still get the death penalty?

The only reason treason could be useful here is that it would make the person convicted ineligible to hold any federal office.

<TEXT> Honestly, Trump is fucking up the governing part so badly that, once we start reaping the fruit of his policies, we'll see a backlash as bad if not worse than the one against George W. Bush. He's making opposition pretty easy. Democrats are in a good position to defeat him politically *without* a magic bullet that removes him from office.

I wouldn't be so dismissive of the scandal and the possibility of direct evidence of collusion emerging. This is actually progressing at an incredible pace relative to past scandals, like Watergate. We'll likely know soon enough.

<TEXT> There might be more political advantage for Democrats in letting Trump ruin the country and riding the backlash to power. But it's not worth it. Power shouldn't be treated as an end in itself. We should always try to make things the best we can right now.

I don't disagree that the Russian interference (and, above all, Comey) had adverse downballot effects that cost Democrats at least the Senate. But if a re-vote or special election is going to happen, even in theory, Republicans have to get something out of it. That something would basically be a chance to put country before party and throw Trump overboard in order to limit the lasting damage to their brand. A momentary loss of power at the Presidential level is not as bad as being permanently known as the "complicity in treason" Party. They'd also get to keep the downballot results of the tainted elections too, as part of the same compromise. 

We have to accept that some of the damage of 2016 is probably irreparable. The is no perfect remedy. The point is only to limit the damage as much as possible.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sympathetic to what you're saying about not using the term treason loosely, but I actually think there's a colorable case of treason to be made on this fact pattern.

The Constitution sets the outer limit of what can be considered treason at [Article III, Section 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section3), which provides:

----------

Treason against the United States, shall consist ***only*** in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. **No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.**

The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture ***except*** during the life of the person attainted.

----------

The statutory definition of treason, codified at [18 U.S.C. 2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) pursuant to Congress's constitutional power to punish treason, defines the offense as:

---

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or **adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere**, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

---

Here, no one levied war against the U.S., so we're left "adherence to the enemy, giving them aid and comfort."

Note that the key phrase "aid and comfort"which appears in both definitionshas a narrow, restrictive meaning. But it doesn't necessarily require Russia to be a wartime enemy. In [*Cramer v. United States*, 325 US 1 (1945)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2809896451252158562 q="18+u.s.c.+2381" hl=en as_sdt=2006), the U.S. Supreme Court explained that:

---

 Treason of adherence to an enemy was old in the law. It consisted of breaking allegiance to one's own king by forming an attachment to his enemy. Its scope was comprehensive, its requirements indeterminate. It might be predicated on intellectual or emotional sympathy with the foe, or merely lack of zeal in the cause of one's own country. That was not the kind of disloyalty the framers thought should constitute treason. They promptly accepted the proposal to restrict it to cases where also there was conduct which was "giving them aid and comfort."

**"Aid and comfort" was defined** by Lord Reading in the Casement trial comprehensively, as it should be, and yet probably with as much precision as the nature of the matter will permit: **". . . an act which strengthens or tends to strengthen the enemies of the King in the conduct of a war against the King, that is in law the giving of aid and comfort"** and **"an act which weakens or tends to weaken the power of the King and of the country to resist or to attack the enemies of the King and the country . . . is . . . giving of aid and comfort."** Lord Reading explained it, as we think one must, in terms of an "act." It is not easy, if indeed possible, to think of a way in which "aid and comfort" can be "given" to an enemy except by some kind of action. Its very nature partakes of a deed or physical activity as opposed to a mental operation.

**Thus the crime of treason consists of two elements: [1] adherence to the enemy; and [2] rendering him aid and comfort.** A citizen intellectually or emotionally may favor the enemy and harbor sympathies or convictions disloyal to this country's policy or interest, but so long as he commits no act of aid and comfort to the enemy, there is no treason. On the other hand, a citizen may take actions which do aid and comfort the enemy  making a speech critical of the government or opposing its measures, profiteering, striking in defense plants or essential work, and the hundred other things which impair our cohesion and diminish our strength  but if there is no adherence to the enemy in this, if there is no intent to betray, there is no treason. (*Numeration and emphasis added*.)

---

From this, it doesn't seem like a state of war is necessarily required, because aid and comfort also encompasses overt acts which "weake[n] or ten[d] to weaken the power of the ... of the country to resist or to attack the enemies of ... the country." 

Subverting an election for the highest federal office likely meets this test if there was an explicit *quid pro quo* to secure illicit Russian campaign assistance (and possibly funding) in exchange for U.S. foreign policies desired by Putinincluding a weakening of NATO, the U.S.'s principal military alliance, and consequent impairment of the U.S.' ability to "resist or to attack [its] enemies."

The agreement to subvert our election would likely satisfy the "**adherence to the enemy**" element of treason (which could be further inferred from the delivery of pro-Putin policies detrimental to U.S. national security and use of the hacked information knowing that it was unlawfully obtained and disclosed under this illicit deal). Enacting pro-Putin policies and speaking favorably of Putin would likely satisfy the overt act of "**aid and comfort**" element. Russia has long been an adversarial power, and the hostile act of subverting our democratic election to promote its objectives and weaken our principal defensive military alliance would likely be sufficient to establish **emnity**. So if you had **two witnesses**, you might even be able to convict for treason in the strict [18 U.S.C.  2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) sense. 

Of course, there are easier charges to bring.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not that complicated actuallyjust politically difficult. 

I think we agree on the basic problem.

Impeachment would be fine if Trump were removed for something he did while in office, or for something that he did before the election that did not affect the election outcome directly. Pence would have a very strong constitutional claim to the Presidency in such a situation if he was not a culpable participant.

But if Trump is removed for collusion with the Kremlin to subvert the election, then Pence would be a product of the same tainted election and thus illegitimate even if he didn't know about the collusion (though he likely would have known). We agree (I think) that running the election again is the way to fix this.

Here are some ways to do that:

-----

1. The least complex is to impeach Pence and Trump (in that order) after amending the Presidential Succession Act (PSA) to require a special election within 90 days of a double vacancy. This would likely need to be done over Trump's veto. After Trump's impeachment, the amended PSA would be triggered. Paul Ryan serves as acting President during the campaign, then the election is held and the new President assumes office. This is totally constitutional and would resolve the legitimacy crisis. Technically, it wouldn't be a do-over, but a special election to fill a vacancy.

2. Another possibility is to wait for the findings of the Congressional committee investigations and file suit to annul the election with the committee reports (and supporting documentation) as evidence. If successful, this would vacate the Presidency and Vice-Presidency and could void any acts that Trump took as President (since the election would be invalid, he would have never have held the office legitimately). If the amended PSA is in place, that would trigger the special election to fill the vacancy. This latter possibility is [discussed at length here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5tbwm5/intel_community_trump_administration_turning_on/ddlplwc/). Technically, this too would not be a do-over.

3. Alternatively, a federal court could annul the election and directly order a re-vote. This *would* be a do-over in the technical sense because it would be the same election being held again, as opposed to a special election to fill a vacancy. The equitable power exists for a court do this to address a tainted election. But the order would likely have to come from a solid SCOTUS majority to be perceived as legitimate. SCOTUS could order Congress to take a crack at it first under its supervision, but then step in if Congress failed to do so. Trump would likely resist, so it would be important to get Congress onboard with the credible threat of impeachment. Ideally, he and Pence would resign (avoiding the shame) and Ryan would become acting President until the judicially- or legislatively-ordered re-vote took place.

4. A final option would be to just pass a constitutional amendment annuling the 2016 election and ordering a re-vote. There's no question this would be valid, but it would be very difficult to do.

For reference, [Article II, Section 1, Clauses 4 and 6](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section1) provide, respectively:

The **Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes**; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.

and

**In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office**, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the **Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability,** ***both*** **of the President and Vice President**, declaring what officer shall then ***act as President***, and such officer shall act accordingly, **until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.**      

This is broad enough to authorize a special election.        </TEXT>

[TL:DR] Just amend the Presidential Succession Act to provide for a special election and then create a dual vacancy by (1) impeaching Pence and Trump in that order, or by (2) judicially annuling the election and vacating both offices.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> You correctly identify why this is such a problem. But, respectfully, we *do* know how to deal with this problem as a democracy. It's not to give the second-place finisher a win by disqualification. But it's also not to allow *anyone* (like Pence) to benefit in any way from the tainted election.  **Rather, we annul the election and hold a new one.** 

Voting again would be the logical way to remove the taint of foreign interference and restore legitimacy to the Presidency. Other Western OECD countries--like Austria--[have done this recently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_presidential_election,_2016), even in less extreme situations.

In a republic, [the people, collectively, are sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_sovereignty). As Madison explained in [Federalist 39](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed39.asp), our "government ... derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior." 

When we hold an election, we invest a portion of our sovereignty in persons whom we elect to hold public offices with various duties and powers. The Presidency is foremost among those. But the powers of the Presidency are derived, ultimately, from the American people (*i.e.*, consent of the governed). Here, the people's free choice may have been thwarted by a coordinated disinformation campaign in which Trump allegedly participated. This taints the election result. 

All a re-vote accomplishes is **measure the will of the People again** (as a way to moot the problems in the earlier measurement).  Since we're not a direct democracy, popular will doesn't get expressed continuously through direct choices about policy, but rather, indirectly through the People's chosen representatives including the President. Those representatives have to be chosen at some point in time. But there's nothing magical about *that particular time*. An election simply gauges who the people want to hold the office for the next term. This is where the common analogies between elections and competitive sports contests break down. The winner of an election gets no prize.  Rather, he (or she) is invested and entrusted with the People's power. This is a distinct honor. But in no way does the office *belong* to the office*holder*.  The People are not bestowing a permanent title on someone. A re-vote thus cannot deprive the winner of an annulled election of anything to which they'd be entitled independent of the People's will, as expressed in an election.

<TEXT> It says "*choosing* the electors." So that part is *not* refering to the EC, but the general election. Then you have the part that says "and the day on which they [*i.e., the electors*] shall give their votes," which *is* the EC.

If you read this together with Clause 6, there doesn't seem to be any problem with scheduling a new special election to fill a dual vacancy:

In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and **the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what officer shall then act as President, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.**

Specifically, it doesn't say "until... a President shall *next be regularly* elected," it just says "until... a President shall be elected." That's broad enough to encompass a special election if Congress wants to authorize and schedule one (which it has the power to do under Clause 4).

<TEXT> The Constitution authorizes Congress to provide for Presidential succession when there's no President and no VP.

<TEXT> I think the VP is fine if the motive for impeachment isn't directly related to the validity of the election itself. But if it was, or if you lose the President and VP, there should be a special election, with people in the line of succession acting as caretakers. The great thing is that the Constitution actually authorizes this.

Article II, Section 1, Clauses 4 and 6 provide:

    The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.

and

    In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what officer shall then act as President, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.

Thus, Congress could simply amend the Presidential Succession Act (PSA) to provide for a special election within some set time when the Presidency and Vice-Presidency are vacant, and specifying that the designated federal officer (Speaker Ryan or whomever would follow in the line of succession of the current or amended PSA) would "act" as an interim caretaker President. (*Acting* President Ryan would be finefor a few months at most.) Then you either annul the election judicially or impeach Pence and Trump in that order (or get them to resign). That would create the dual vacancy that would trigger the PSA.

After a short campaign, we hold a new election and the newly elected President serves until the next regularly-scheduled election.

Done.

<TEXT> It's hard because the most plausible ways to do it all will require significant Republican cooperation19 votes in the Senate to convict Pence and Trump on articles of impeachment (assuming 100% Democratic support), 23 votes in the House to pass legislation amending the Presidential Succession Act (more likely 94 since you'd probably have to override Trump's veto).

But in principle it can be doneparticularly if Congress is facing [Tahrir Square on the National Mall](https://youtu.be/ASnaFc3oRQY) every day, with no end in sight.

Doing it without Republican cooperation would require the courts. But even SCOTUS can't enforce its decisions. So that's potentially a more difficult path.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> And we don't have to stand for the robbery.

 If there was coordination with an underlying agreement or understandingnamely, illicit campaign help or funding in exchange for policies benefiting the Kremlinthat's arguably treason. 

Even if not (or there aren't two witnesses), it's still potentially bribery, violation of election laws, conspiracy to commit (or aiding and abetting) computer fraud, as well as fraud on the electorate. Those charges are very serious and considerably easier to prove.

If this holds up, we should not settle for anything less than total annulment of the tainted election and removal of all of its rotten fruit. Only a re-vote or else a special election to fill the dual vacancy of Pence and Trump after impeachment can *even begin* to remedy the wrong and restore political legitimacy.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Trump administration is asking a federal appeals court to expedite its review of President Donald Trump's revised travel ban executive order.

The Justice Department Wednesday asked the Richmond-based 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to speed up its handling of the federal government's effort to overturn an injunction a Maryland-based judge entered earlier this month, barring Trump from implementing a ban on issuance of visas to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries.

Justice Department attorneys also indicated they plan to ask the appeals court to stay U.S. District Court Judge Theodore Chuang's injunction while the appeal goes forward.

...

A federal judge in Hawaii handling a suit brought by the State of Hawaii issued an even broader injunction against Trump's revised travel ban order, blocking not only the six-country, 90-day visa ban but also a 120-day suspension of refugee admissions from across the globe as well as other provisions.

The Justice Department has not yet filed an appeal in that case, but is expected to. That appeal would go to another appeals court, the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

<TEXT> From the article:

Monday was a breakout moment for Schiff: 

The chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), gave Schiff a generous 15 minutes to make an opening statement in the committee's rare public hearing with FBI Director James B. Comey and National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers.

**Schiff used that time to launch a bold argument of why Democrats are suspicious Trump campaign associates colluded with Russia during the election.** Among the connections Schiff pointed out:

    One of Trump's national security advisers during the campaign, Carter Page, has ties to Russia and has praised its president, Vladimir Putin

    Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had been on the payroll for pro-Russian interests in Ukraine.

    Trump officials met with the Russian ambassador to Washington during the Republican National Convention. At that convention, Republicans changed their platform to remove a section that supported giving weapons to Ukraine as it battles Russia for territory.

    Former Trump adviser Roger Stone boasted in a speech that he knew of impending WikiLeaks documents related to Hillary Clinton's campaign before they were published.

    Former national security adviser Michael Flynn and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions would avoid disclosing their conversations with the Russian ambassador during or shortly after the campaign.

After laying that out, Schiff (rhetorically) asked:

    Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, **maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians use the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they employed in Europe and elsewhere?** We simply don't know. Not yet. And we owe it to the country to find out.    </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'd argue that it gives the IC too much power. If they don't like a candidate/president they can open an investigation (even without merit) to derail an election or appointment. We shouldn't be willing to give law enforcement that much power. Now if an impeachment process were started I'd say wait, but investigation alone shouldn't be enough to hold them up.

I actually [tend to agree](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/the_fbi_is_trumpland_anticlinton_atmosphere/d9kctvb/), but we've already [crossed that bridge](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/hillary_clinton_and_her_team_tried_to_warn_us/dcctqr2/?utm_content=permalink utm_medium=user utm_source=reddit utm_name=frontpage). 

Norms have to be re-established and possibly statutorily codified. But right now, we need every tool at our disposal to contain the damage. The fact that this happened after the refusal to even consider Garland weighs heavily. It's not like a random vacancy. It's a vacancy that was basically stolen, which is only compounded by the taint of illegitimacy surrounding Trump until we get to the bottom of the Russia investigation.

Plus there's the investigation itself, which is still ongoing according to Comey. If it was so clear cut, that part of the investigation would presumably be done.

#####'That money we have is blood money'

In a series of texts reviewed by Business Insider allegedly sent by Andrea to her sister, Jessica, in March 2015, Andrea said that their father "**has no moral or legal compass**."

"**Don't fool yourself**," Andrea Manafort allegedly wrote to her sister. "**That money we have is blood money**."

"**You know he has killed people in Ukraine? Knowingly**," she continued, according to the reviewed messages. "As a tactic to outrage the world and get focus on Ukraine. Remember when there were all those deaths taking place. A while back. About a year ago. Revolts and what not. **Do you know whose strategy that was to cause that**, to send those people out and get them slaughtered." 

...

"**He is a sick f------ tyrant**," Andrea allegedly wrote to Bond about her father. "**And we keep showing up and dancing for him ... We just keep showing up and eating the lobster. Nothing changes.**"

<TEXT> No I'm not at all. Are you watching him? 

Yeah. Hes got impressive credentials, as well being affable, intelligent, and presenting well. 

I just watched the man speak for 3 hours, while people grilled him on case after case through his career, and I felt he made a lot of good points. Just because I disagree with his ideology, doesn't mean I have to hate him. He believes what I stated in my previous comment, and while I may not agree, I think that's sound logic. 


I dont hate him either. But that doesnt mean I think hes an appropriate choice for the SCOTUS. 

Let the legislative body legislate law. Let the judicial body distribute justice based off said laws.

Except its not that simple. In a common law system with binding precedent, Courts inherently make law whenever they decide a case based on its specific facts or resolve vagueness or ambiguities in the statutory or constitutional text. Its called case law. With SCOTUS, the Court decides what broad constitutional language means when applied to situations the Framers couldnt possibly envision. 

And that if we want things to change, we shouldn't be look to the courts, but to the legislative body to impart new laws. That if you want to overturn something like citizens united, you make news laws and regulations stipulating corperate donations, not ask the supreme Court to rule that the limiting of freedom of speech by a corperate entity is constitutional.

Citizens United was a constitutional ruling. It prohibited many of the laws youre advocating for on First Amendment groundsbecause a conservative majority of the court decided to make new constitutional law on the question of corporate free speech. The only way to overturn the ruling, without the SCOTUS overruling it, would be to enact a constitutional amendment. 
Do I agree with corperate donations to campaigns? Of course not. But do I understand his viewpoint? Definitely. We've got a real communication problem on the left. You can't just send me a Times article and expect me to forget what I just saw with my own eyes.

Im not saying to forget what you saw. Im asking for you to put it in context. [He wants to get on the court and gave answers calculated to maximize the chances of that.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-21/the-real-reason-to-watch-the-gorsuch-hearings)  

Even if he's idiologically right of Scalia, you can't demonize him for that and say this is all just for the optics. And I hesitate to say it, but this is part of the attitude that rejects what we tried to tell them about Trump. You treat people like they're dumb, and then send them an article to refute what they just witnessed. So how's that supposed to inspire trust in experts? Now things like views on things race, religion, and sexuality, aren't things I feel are up for debate. You can't discriminate against someone for things they can't change about themselves. But we're talking about a viewpoint on the constitution and seperation of powers. And thats something that is certainly debatable, and other's viewpoints should be heard. And I felt he made logical, sound arguments for his viewpoint.

Im not demonizing Gorsuch. Im merely presenting quantitative statistics summarizing his judicial record. Given those statistics, he doesnt seem like the right fitespecially in light of the refusal to even consider Garland for 310 days (the previous longest delay between a nomination and final action was 127 days, and the average is well under that). If Republicans get to block Democratic nominations but have their nominees confirmed, you dont have a fair representation of the diversity of judicial opinion on the Court.

<TEXT> He's honestly made some great points I had never thought of before.

Are you being facetious?

He makes great points about the seperation of powers, and not over stepping the legislative branches duty to write laws. Pointing out that it's the judicial bodies job to enforce the law, and also determine whether or not laws are constitutional, not to write them.

This is what they *always* say. They understand the optics and politics of confirmation. But when they get in power, they engage in highly ideological conservative judicial activism.

<TEXT> This argument has intuitive appeal and shifts the focus from Gorsuch to Trump. Glad that Schumer went there:

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke on the Senate floor a day after FBI Director James B. Comey confirmed that the bureau was investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the presidential race.

As part of his extraordinary admission, coming while he testified before a House committee on Monday, the FBI director also noted that the probe began last July, at the height of the presidential contest.

The presidential campaign also kept open the seat Gorsuch hopes to fill. Within hours of Justice Antonin Scalias death last year, Senate Republicans vowed not to consider anyone nominated by then-President Barack Obama because it was an election year, a promise they held after Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland.

**Id like to point out that it is the height of irony that Republicans held this Supreme Court seat open for nearly a calendar year while President Obama was in office, but are now rushing to fill the seat for a president whose campaign is under investigation by the FBI,** Schumer said, according to remarks sent out by his office.

Schumer said that, to him, it appeared **unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court Justice with a lifetime appointment due to the looming FBI investigation, which could potentially last for months or years.**

**You can bet that if the shoe was on the other foot  and a Democratic president was under investigation by the FBI  that Republicans would be howling at the moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such circumstances,** Schumer said. After all, they stopped a president who wasnt under investigation from filling a seat with nearly a year left in his presidency.

This already represents a theft of Garland's seat for nakedly political reasons. And if the Trump campaign did collude with Russia, the appointment--like Trump's election--would be totally illegitimate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A) Sovereign immunity doesn't apply here. Sovereign Immunity means the US Government can't be sued in Mexican courts, but Mexican citizen can absolutely sue the Government in a US court. If these individuals could prove harm they absolutely do have standing in order to sue.


That's not totally acurate. The reason you can sue the U.S. Government for damages is the limited statutory waiver of immunity embodied in the [Federal Tort Claims Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act). The default is that you *wouldn't* be able to because sovereign immunity. The sovereign immunity that you describe *also* exists, but it isn't the limit of the doctrine. 

B) Given the Internets ability to play detective, how long do you think it will take someone to crawl through mug shots and blotter reports to start putting names and pictures to that list? While the individual pieces of data are all public record, the combination of data is absolutely individually identifiable. 

This is possible. And if I were a criminal defense lawyer, I might use it to argue that the government is making it impossible for the accused to have a fair trial. Beyond that, it's promoting generalized anti-immigrant resentment and singling out state officials for non-cooperation when state law may well prohibit affirnative cooperation (recalling that such prohibitions *can* be Constitutional under cases like *Printz v. US* and *NFIB v. Sebelius*).

<TEXT> White House press secretary Sean Spicer made a point Monday to suggest that a top adviser to Donald Trump's presidential campaign wasn't really a top adviser at all. Paul Manafort, who was the campaign chairman for months, was reduced to having played a very limited role for a very limited period of time.

...

In the same briefing Monday, Spicer seemed to dismiss longtime informal Trump adviser Roger Stone and former foreign policy adviser Carter Page as hangers-on. Some of those names, the greatest amount of interaction that they've had is have cease-and-desist letters sent to them, Spicer said. Former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, meanwhile, was only a volunteer of the campaign, Spicer said.

The common link between all four men, of course, is that they are now liabilities  under scrutiny for their interactions related to an investigation of Russian meddling in the campaign. But Spicer's efforts to suggest that their roles didn't amount to much truly strain credulity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> FBI director James Comey will be in the hot seat Monday facing lawmakers who accuse him of stonewalling Congress, as they demand answers about Donald Trump's potential Russia ties and the president's extraordinary accusation of wiretapping by his predecessor.

 The two explosive issues have preoccupied Republicans and Democrats alike for weeks, robbing Trump's administration of a smoother rollout and raising uncomfortable questions about possible collusion between Trump associates and the Kremlin. The stakes for the tycoon-turned-world-leader could hardly be higher.

...

Several congressional panels have launched investigations into Russia's alleged interference, including House and Senate intelligence committees, which have jurisdiction over the nation's 17 intelligence agencies, and the House and Senate judiciary committees.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also probing Russian interference in the election.

The question remains whether the agency has opened a criminal investigation into possible ties between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials.

Monday's hearing promises to be a very public showdown between the FBI and lawmakers, with the national security world certain to watch whether Comey drops a political bombshell on Washington.

Members of Congress have expressed mounting frustration over the lack of cooperation from the FBI about Russia and Trump's incendiary wiretap claim, which Barack Obama and an array of other officials have flatly denied. </TEXT>

In any event, a hell of a lot of people are voting for republicans at all levels, and gerrymandering, which we are using to mean "manipulation of the boundaries of an electoral constituency so as to favor one party or class." before you inserted yourself into the discussion, is not the sole cause. 

I never claimed gerrymandering was the sole cause. I said that state lines are analogous to accidental historical gerrymandering and these lines absolutely affect the outcome.

Again, you cant understand this election without looking at the fact that it would have been the third term with the Democrats in power. Since FDR/Truman, thats only happened oncein 1988. Holding the Presidency tends to decimate a party downballot. Similarly, if youre going to talk about Congress and the Presidency, you have to look at [Comeys](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/hillary_clinton_and_her_team_tried_to_warn_us/dcctqr2/?utm_content=permalink utm_medium=user utm_source=reddit utm_name=frontpage) last-minute intervention and the Russian/Wikileaks interference. Even with that, Trump failed to win the popular vote. But this is a tangent. The point is, the EC, which is analogous to a gerrymander, alters the outcome of the election.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lets refocus on the original claim I was responding to:

[Gerrymandering] ... does not affect statewide and nationwide votes. I'd say the disenfranchisement of voters is the biggest issue at those levels, although gerrymandering a huge issue with district-wide voting.

You claimed that:
You're trying to cover for the fact that you tried to tell someone that state lines are like a gerrymander. 

I'm not trying to cover for anything. I've said in every one of the preceding posts that I'm **analogizing** arbitrary geographical boundaries that waste votes to gerrymandering:

1. State lines are ***like*** an **arbitrary historical gerrymander**. 

2. **Conceptually**, Gerrymandering is simply changing the outcome of a vote by **redrawing** the lines of electoral districts. ***You're right that state lines don't generally change.*** That doesn't mean **those specific lines**as opposed to other lines that could've existedaren't **determining the outcome**.  

3. **My argument isn't that it's literal gerrymandering**. It's that you have **arbitrary electoral districts determining the outcome**. That's **conceptually analogous**. The popular voteaggregated nationally, with no sub-containers and vote wastageis resistant to such changes, whether arbitrary or deliberately partisan. 

Id say Ive been consistent. My argument hasnt changed. Ive said explicitly that state lines, in several relevant respects, *are* like gerrymandering.

The electoral college is not gerrymandering. Representative democracy is not gerrymandering. Gerrymandering has a very specific meaning which you don't seem to understand.

I understand gerrymandering perfectly, and have made clear from the outset that I'm not using the most restrictive meaning of that term, but instead analogizing to how arbitrary geographical lines and sub-aggregationrather than popular preferencesare determining the outcome under the EC.

The conceptual part that is important is not sub-containers or vote wastage, it's redrawing boundaries intentionally to affect the results of the election.

That's your opinion. Mine is that sub-aggregationand the resulting vote wastageare incredibly important, regardless of intent. 

Whenever you subdivide the electorate into **single-member districts** (**SMD**), you almost certainly create disproportionality and wasted votes. Because of **clumpiness** (*i.e.*, the smallest increment of legislative representation requires multiple votes and you can't have fractional legislative seats), some disproportionality is inevitable whenever you translate a popular vote share into some smaller number of legislative seats. Lets but this unavoidable disproportionality aside for now. 


There are two types of vote wastage Im concerned with: (1) votes that don't count because another candidate has at least one more vote in the electoral district; and (2) useless excess victory margin in an electoral district that can't offset opponents votes in other districts because of the geographical line separating the districts (*i.e.*, more votes than are necessary to guarantee a win given the number of votes cast). These two effects are the basis for **cracking** (dilution of opponents across multiple districts) and **packing** (concentrating opponents voters in fewer districts), which are the basic tools of gerrymandering. But the key point to recognize here is that even districts drawn using neutral criteria, such as compactness, can lead to a significant mismatch between legislative representation and the electorate's actual preferences.

The Washington Post's Wonkblog [illustrates this perfectly](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2015/03/gerry.png w=480). In the second example of the diagram, 60% of the popular vote becomes 100% of the legislative seats. This disproportionality occurs despite that fact that each district is (1) compact and (2) precisely matches the composition of the overall electorate. An election producing such an outcome would not be a good reflection of the support actually enjoyed by the blue party among the hypothetical electorate. 

Recall that, under your definition, gerrymandering is redrawing boundaries **intentionally** to affect the results of the election. So this result wouldnt be gerrymandering if it were brought about by a neutral computer algorithm rather than by partisan operative intending to affect the outcome. Indeed, note that the perfect representation shown in the first illustrated example is actually *less* compact than the second example. This isnt an abstract hypothetical, either. Because of urban-rural sorting, there would still be a significant degree of disproportionality between vote shares and legislative representation *even if* redistricting process werent subject to partisan control and gamesmanship. This disproportionality is problematic even if it isnt intentionally partisan.

So let's look at the 2016 election

There were 136,639,786 total votes for President. According to the [U.S. Elections Project](http://www.electproject.org/2016g) 59.3% of the **voting-eligible population** (**VEP**) cast ballots for President in 2016. There were 128,612,245 votes for House candidates, or 55.7% of the VEP. (The Senate popular vote in 2016 is less useful since only 1/3 of the Senate was up, and CA had an election between two Democrats to replace Barbara Boxer.)

Lets look at this more closely in the Presidential race:

Under existing electoral rules, Trump won. My point was that merely winning an election that geographically subdivides the vote and sub-aggregate does not indicate the Peoples broad preference. 
    
Specifically, 2,868,692 (2.1%) more people voted for Clinton, the plurality PV winner with 65,853,516 votes (48.2%).  In total, candidates *other than Trump* got 73,654,962 votes (53.9%), whereas he only got 62,979,879 votes (46.1%less vote share than Romney, who received 47.2%). Trump emerged the winner only because the EC valued the geographically-contingent judgment of 77,744 people in MI, WI   PA more than that of 2,946,436 second-class citizens nationwide (almost 38 times as many people). Basically a packed football stadium worth of people in these the swing states mattered more than a number of voters roughly equivalent to the entire population of Utah, Mississippi, Kansas, Nevada or Arkansas. 

Another good way to analyze this outcome would be to determine how many votes were needed to guarantee it (*i.e.*, how many votes were *material* rather than *wasted*). In other words: how many votes were absolutely necessary to ensure plurality wins in the various states that Clinton or Trump carried, respectively? 

By this criteria, only 27,786,490 Clinton votes (20.33% of the total) and 36,632,698 Trump votes (26.81% of the total cast) actually mattered. 72,220,598 votes (52.85% of the total cast) were wasted with no effect on the outcome. 

Of these wasted votes, 38,067,026 were Clinton's11,714,900 more wasted votes than Trump. Again, this is because of the arbitrary state lines. This is an *extraordinary* level of vote wastage. But it wasnt brought about through deliberate manipulation. Rather, it follows automatically from sub-aggregation within each electoral district (state), rather than in a single at large national aggregate that allows each vote to count equally and offset votes cast in any state.

So, not gerrymandering? We're just saying it's not gerrymandering leading to governors' elections and you're arguing against us. Now you finally admit that governors elections are not determined by gerrymandering.

Point to where I said that gerrymandering had anything to do with governors elections. With my original post, I was responding to the issue of how state lines operate effectivelythough not literallylike a gerrymander of the Presidential vote. Votes are aggregated separately in 51 sub-containerswith the winner of containers having a majority of the total volume of containers being the winner of the overall election (rather than the person with the most votes). The concrete example I gave showed how you could change the outcome with minor shifts to the boundaries of the containers, which are historical accidents. 

My point about how governorships and other down ballot races appear to work counter-cyclically to the Presidency was simply responding to your reply and suggesting that you shouldnt read too much into Republican dominance of those races. They *do* dominate, but theyd also be expected to dominate after a 2-term Democratic Presidency. 

Also, your evidence doesn't fit your argument. Obama did worse with governors of his party on an absolute and relative basis than anyone since Nixon/Ford. Nixon wasn't in office longer than Reagan, Clinton, Bush, or Obama. Reagan lost 2 governors, HW Bush lost 2, W Bush lost 7. Clinton lost 11 governors. Obama lost 13. No, I don't think it's largely a function of who holds the White House and how long they've been there.

Under Nixon/Ford, Republicans controlled the Presidency for 8 years. Thats whats being compared. Likewise, HW Bush was in office for 4 years and thus isnt included in the original table. Same with Carter. But if you look at 8-year periods of party control theres a pretty regular pattern of the Presidents party always losing governorships and the effect tending to increase with time. This is 30000 foot pattern recognition analysis. Im not positing a specific function here. If I were to want to do that, Id do a regression analysis--which, at minimum, would control for approval rating and would posit an increasing (non-linear) marginal effect over time (ruling party fatigue).

<TEXT> This is a real shame. The robotic space probes aren't as sexy as human space exploration. But they are where a vast majority of the real science gets done.

Europa is one of the most interesting places we can visit, and we've already had prior cancelations of probes that would have studied it. During the Bush administration, the [Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Orbiter) (JIMO) missionan ambitious probe that would have had ion-electric propulsion and a fission reactor with enough power for instruments like ground penetrating radar and a rail gun to vaporize targets for spectrometrywas cancelled to fund human missions. JIMO would have studied Ganymede, Calisto, and Europa (the ion engine would have allowed it to enter orbit around separate Jovian moons rather than depending on inertia). 

Now this Europa lander is cancelled. This really sucks for the scientists who basically now lose a part of their career they'll never get back.

But if he deliberately lied or concealed something that would have made him ineligible for naturalization in the first instance, then he could still be denaturalized. There doesn't appear to be a statute of limitations.

<TEXT> Believed to have been acting on President Trumps direct orders, White House press secretary Sean Spicer repeated it on Thursday night during a bizarre news conference having heard it from a TV pundit on US news network Fox News.

The revelation comes after America apparrently issued a grovelling apology to Downing Street yesterday for spreading the false claim that Trumps predecessor Barack Obama asked GCHQ to snoop on him after his shock election victory In November.

...

**An intelligence source told The Sun: We have identified the site where the claim was first made.**

**The whole incident bears all the hallmarks of the Russians. Its a shame people who should know better fell for it.**

A formal apology for it came overnight via Donald Trumps National Security Advisor H R McMaster to his opposite number in No10, the PMs security chief Sir Mark Lyall Grant.

Mr Spicer also rang Britains Ambassador in Washington DC Sir Kim Darroch yesterday to promise him the allegation would not be repeated.

Branding the claim complete and utter nonsense, a furious GCHQ spokesman said late on Thursday night: Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct wire tapping against the then President elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.

However, Trump brushed off questions about the claims at a press conference later, saying he very seldom regrets anything he tweets.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the most relevant section:

###Accidents of history

**Ultimately, state lines are pretty arbitrary.** Yes, when those lines were determined, there were reasoned considerations like population and access to rivers and resources. **But statehood and state lines, often poorly surveyed in the first place, were hotly disputed in the 19th century.** Many states were created in response to political considerations, especially the balance between free and slave states. In other times, it could have gone very differently.

Consider two of the bigger nonpolitical state boundary questions of the 19th century: the fate of the Florida Panhandle and the Toledo War.

The Toledo War was a long dispute between Michigan and Ohio over a tiny strip of land along their border, which happens to include the city of Toledo. Ohio had the upper hand for one reason: It earned its statehood first, and therefore blocked Michigans petition  which included the strip. In the end, Congress proposed a deal: Michigan would relinquish its claim on the Toledo strip and, in exchange, would get the Upper Peninsula.

The Florida Panhandle and the Florida Peninsula were governed as separate regions  West and East Florida  under Spanish and British rule. They were effectively separated by hundreds of miles of treacherous swamp and forest.

Ultimately, West and East Florida were combined into one state. This was mainly coincidental: Alabama earned statehood before the Florida territory was annexed. West Florida repeatedly tried to join Alabama, starting as soon as the state was annexed and lasting all the way past the Civil War. Many of these efforts  which included referendums, congressional petitions and direct negotiations between Florida and Alabama  nearly succeeded. But they ultimately did not.

**If these minor border issues had gone differently, Mrs. Clinton would probably be president.** The Florida Panhandle is heavily Republican: Without it, the rest of Florida votes Democratic. Both halves of the Toledo War worked out poorly for Mrs. Clinton. Not only would she have won Michigan with Toledo, but she would have also won Michigan without the Upper Peninsula: Only the full trade gives Mr. Trump a narrow win.

**Interestingly, the same changes would have flipped the 2000 election, and perhaps the 1876 election, to the same result as the national popular vote** (though I dont have county-level results for Florida in that election). The pronounced regionalism at play in 1888 would have made it harder to change the outcome by tweaking state lines.

To be clear, you can also make plenty of changes that would benefit Republicans. You could reunify West Virginia and Virginia, to take an easy one.

**The point is that the main bias of the Electoral College isnt against big states or regionalism; its just toward the big battleground states.** If they break overwhelmingly one way, thats who wins. This is not exactly a high-minded Hamiltonian argument. **There arent many justifications for letting a few close states decide a close national election. But thats basically what the system does, and** ***theres nothing about those states that ensures they provide a representative outcome.***

----

My argument isn't that it's *literal* gerrymandering. It's that you have arbitrary electoral districts determining the outcome. That's conceptually analogous. The popular voteaggregated nationally, with no sub-containers and vote wastageis resistant to such changes, whether arbitrary or deliberately partisan. 

As for Governorships, it's largely [a counter-cyclical function of who holds the White House and how long they've been there](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/content/images/KDK2016111701-table5.png).  

In any event, the wisdom of the crowd rejected Trump. His election doesn't indicate the People's preference for him. It shows only that an electorally-potent minority, empowered by accidents of geography and history, voted for him in the right places.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Conceptually, Gerrymandering is simply changing the outcome of a vote by redrawing the lines of electoral districts. You're right that state lines don't generally change. That doesn't mean those specific linesas opposed to other lines that could've existedaren't the determining the outcome. This is the problem with making some people second-class citizens based on where they live.

<TEXT> Your apollogies in all honor, he does represent the view of your country. 

He represents the view of an electorally-potent minority of the country. The EC valued the judgment of 77,744 people in MI, WI   PA more than that of 2,946,436 second-class citizens nationwide. 

He ran on that platform and was elected for it. You can enter into technicalities like popular vote...

The vote count was accurate and he was elected. But the popular vote isn't a technicality. It represents the broadest measure of the will of the people who voted. In that aspect, it's a better gauge of voter preference than managing to win bare majorities in electoral districts representing a majority of the electoral vote. Under winner-take-all, if you win a State by one vote, you get all of that state's electorseven if the popular vote was closely split. The winning candidate's excess victory margin and the votes for anyone other than the winner are wasted and not factored into the outcome. This may be the rule that determines who is elected. I'm not disputing the procedural validity of Trump's victory here. But a provedurally-valid electoral victory doesn't necessarily reflect what the people of the country want. 

And all of this is *before* we get into [Comey](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2) or Russia's election interference. 

 but on that i agree with him. He might habe campaigned differently and still won if the popular vote counted. So, dont apologize, go out and vote next time

I agree that we don't know 100% for certain how a popular vote election would've turned out. But by applying some fairly reasonable assumptions, [we can estimate what it might have looked like](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ieay6/comment/db8ooa1). Based on this estimate, which factors demographics of the newly-competitive states, it's highly unlikely that Trump would have won. 

And finally, by the way, I did vote. If every eligible voter in California had cast a ballot, it still wouldn't have mattered. We're second class citizens when it comes to electing our national leaders. But no one seems to complain about the disproportionate share of federal taxes that we pay, while getting only a fraction of every dollar back in federal spending.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who was removed from his post by the Trump administration last week, was overseeing an investigation into stock trades made by the presidents health secretary, according to a person familiar with the office.

...

The Georgia lawmaker traded hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of shares in health-related companies, even as he voted on and sponsored legislation affecting the industry.

Price testified at the time that his trades were lawful and transparent. Democrats accused him of potentially using his office to enrich himself. One lawmaker called for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, citing concerns Price could have violated the STOCK Act, a 2012 law signed by President Obama that clarified that members of Congress cannot use nonpublic information for profit and requires them to promptly disclose their trades.

The investigation of Prices trades by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, which hasnt been previously disclosed, was underway at the time of Bhararas dismissal, said the person.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this scenario is far too optimistic as well. 

The civilian casualties from the mass artillery  strike on South Korea can't be underestimated. And then you have the disruption to the global economy of having a major war in one of the most important, productive and densely-populated parts of Asia. 

If nukes are exchanged in conflict for the first time since 1945, it would erode the taboo surrounding their use and have destabilizing effects throughout the worldeven if it didn't escallate into WWIII. The U.S.' reputation would likely suffer as much if not more than with the Iraq War. And like that war, we'd be paying for it over decades. 

This is a can of worms we don't wanna' open.

<TEXT> Right. And NK's nuclear and missile capabilities aren't that impressive.

If the North Koreans actually *did* try to use nukes against SK or Japan, let alone the U.S., then they will be erased by a U.S. nuclear retaliatory strike, which NK has no hope of disabling with its own nuclear first strike. This is not *mutually assured* destruction (MAD).  Its simply *assured* destruction. For them.

Lets think for a moment about what a NK nuclear attack on the US would look like. The most "plausible"and believe me, that term is very generousway to deliver such an attack would be via a land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 

NK has some ICBMs in the late stages of development, but they arent yet ready for prime time. They'll still have to do many more flight tests to work the kinks out of their ICBM prototypes.

The [KN-08 mod 2, or KN-14](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/dprk/kn-14.htm)an upgraded long-range variant of the [KN-08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN-08) ([technical assessment of KN-08](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs21schilling.pdf)), whose engine has been [successfully fired on the ground](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/dprk/kn-14-first-stage-main-engine-cluster-static-test-firing-4-9-2016.htm), but [not in an actual test flight](http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/no-way-n-korea-has-operational-mobile-icbm-without-testing-engineer/) as far as I knowcould likely reach Chicago, or possibly as far as New York and Washington D.C. on the uppermost end of the [revised estimates based on an observed engine test](http://38north.org/2016/04/schilling041116/).

Heres a pretty comprehensive [technical assessment](http://38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/38-North_ICBM-Report122215.pdf) of the KN-14. The [bottom line](http://38north.org/icbm122215_section7/) is pretty instructive:

The KN-08 Mod 2 will probably be less accurate than we expected for the Mod 1. **The error ellipse will be at least 5 km crossrange and 10 km downrange, and achieving even that level of performance will require multiple calibration tests of the RV** [*i.e.*, re-entry vehicle]. It will also be more **vulnerable to interception,** particularly if the intended recipient can deploy missile systems like **Patriot or THAAD*** in the target areas. ICBM warheads are typically too fast to be shot down by such missiles, but **blunt RVs slow quite a bit as they descend.** [*Note*:the mod 2 version of the KN-08 adopted a [blunt RV](http://38north.org/icbm122215_section2/) in place of a [triconic warhead](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/W87_MIRV.jpg), probably to solve design problems.]

The **biggest advantage of the Mod 2, particularly for the two-stage version we expect, will be increased reliability.** We had previously estimated, based on the performance of other North Korean multistage rockets, that the KN-08 Mod 1 would work only 30-40 percent of the time in early operation. With the more robust design, the **Mod 2 could have a 50-60 percent reliability at its initial operational capability. The North Koreans may have decided to trade a bit of performance to get a missile that is more likely to reach its target than to fall back on North Korean soil.**

After the April 2016 static engine test, which revealed slightly a more advanced Soviet-ripoff rocket design than originally anticipated, its [now projected]( http://38north.org/2016/04/schilling041116/) that:

If the North Koreans can launch an experimental ICBM early next year [*i.e.* 2017], chances are it will not work as planned. (North Korean missiles almost never work the first time.) But the timeline has moved up, and **an initial operational capability for the KN-08 or KN-14 of about 2021 rather than 2023 is entirely possible. There is a small chance that the missile could enter limited service by the end of this decade.** Large-scale deployment would require the ability to manufacture complete 4D10-class engines from scratch when they may still be using ex-Soviet hardware for key components like turbopumps and injector plates. But while this requirement may result in some delay, it is an obstacle that the North Koreans can overcome in time.

So far, weve only talked about the missile. NK also has to successfully weaponize the physics package. 

From the [revised technical assessment of the KN-08](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs21schilling.pdf) at p. 19:

North Koreas most powerful nuclear test had a yield of approximately 10 kilotons, sufficient to destroy soft targets within a 1.5 km radius. The U.S. Mark 7 bomb/warhead, a reasonable proxy for **the largest first-generation fission warhead that North Korea could plausibly deliver to CONUS** [*i.e.*, Contiguous U.S.] targets by a KN-08 missile, had a **maximum yield of 60 kilotons, which still corresponds to a soft-target destruction radius of only 2.8 km.** A KN-08 missile **cannot reliably be used to destroy any specific target,** and certainly not a hardened military target. It would **probably be sufficiently accurate to hit large urban areas,** but not to target specific neighborhoods or districts.

Note that this statement was based on an error ellipse of approximately 4 km cross-range and 8 km downrange, [such that] half of all missiles fired would be expected to fall within such an ellipse.  Id. That was back when the missile was anticipated to have a triconic warhead. Recall that the blunt RV, by contrast, has an error ellipse of *at least* 5 km crossrange and 10 km downrange. And even the triconic warhead estimate assumed significant guidance improvements, since if the North Koreans can only match the accuracy demonstrated by their previous Nodong missiles, the error ellipse of the KN-08 would be roughly 10  20 km at intercontinental ranges. Id. 

In other words, were talking about an ICBM that only makes it to its target without malfunctioning about 50-60% of the time, and then places a warheadwhich may not even go off, and has, at most, a 0.9-1.7 mile soft-target destruction radiussomewhere within 4.5-7.5 miles of where it was aimed, 50% of the time. The other 50% of the time, th warhead is delivered outside this radius. And thats not even factoring the likelihood of interception based on the slow re-entry. 

If the North Korean regime were to *even launch* such a weaponregardless of whether it succeededit would face massive retaliation and certain annihilation. Even though I live on the West Coast, Im not exactly quaking in my boots.  I'm more worried about a war with NK and everything that could entailincluding escallation into WWIII.

<TEXT> Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson ruled out on Friday opening any negotiation with North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile programs and said for the first time that the Trump administration might be forced to take pre-emptive action if they elevate the threat of their weapons program to an unacceptable level.

The policy of strategic patience has ended, Mr. Tillerson said, a reference to the term used by the Obama administration to describe a policy of waiting out the North Koreans, while gradually ratcheting up sanctions and covert action.

...

Negotiations can only be achieved by denuclearizing, giving up their weapons of mass destruction, he said  a step to which the North committed in 1992, and again in subsequent accords, but has always violated. Only then will we be prepared to engage them in talks.

...

Mr. Tillerson argued that a freeze would essentially enshrine a comprehensive set of capabilities North Korea possesses that already pose too great a threat to the United States and its allies, and he said there would be no negotiation until the North agreed to dismantle its programs. </TEXT>

The TL:DR is that while NK does pose some threat, it's far from existential, and deterrence plus additional measures like deploying missile defenses should be sufficient to protect U.S. national security as wrll as that of our allies. Here's an excerpt from the discussion of the risks of a US first strike:

<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) Sansa's Dismay is Littlefinger's Opportunity -- An Analysis of a Key Scene </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-27 21:55:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **[TL:DR] Sansa isnt happy and LF will try to exploit it.**

[D Ds comments on Inside Episode 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRTP9SUkHl8) (2:574:58), fit with how I originally interpreted the King in the North scene.  David Benioff notes Sansa is harboring a little bit of anger  a little bit of jealousy, and that [her relationship with John] will be crucial to watch. Later on he says that he and Weiss were consciously trying to evoke the scene where Robb was named KitN, and that because of this we have to be a little worried for Jon.

Ill go through the key parts of the scene with some general analysis at the end in light of D D's comments:

At 0:34 and 1:15, [we see LF looking subtly pleased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmKkepz_A38) (clip of scene) with the initial disunity and Lord Cerwyn's talk of disbanding the assembled Northern (and Vale) forces.

At 1:23, Lyanna Mormont stands to speak and starts criticizing the houses that didn't support the Starks.  Sansa looks amused (1:59).  Sansa continues to display hints of smile but breaks eye contact and blinks deliberately when Lyanna starts talking about Jon being a bastard (2:08). Although Jon's in the frame at this point, he's out of focus, and we're looking right at Sansa--as if invited to think what she might be thinking. 

Jon is somewhat surprised by Lyanna's passionate declaration of fealty (2:16), there's an uncomfortable stir and silence in the room as Lyanna sits down. The shifting ceases when Lord Manderly stands up and says that Lyanna spoke true.  We see a closeup of Jon with Sansa out of focus in the background (2:40). Manderly then proceeds to admit he was wrong (2:59) and says that Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding (3:06) omitting any mention of Sansa. Sansa is visibly disappointed, and even more out of focus in the background.  As Manderly calls Jon the "White Wolf," she turns her eyes downward and seems to withdraw from the moment into contemplation (3:08-3:10). Jon is intently listening. Manderly unsheathes his sword, calls Jon the King in the North, and falls to his knees. Seeing this turn of events, LF's amusement is totally gone (3:15), his eyes widen and his mouth literally falls open (3:16).  Its noteworthy anytime we see the normally guarded LFs mouth agape. 

Glover then gets up and begins his own speech. He asks for Jon's forgiveness and Jon says there's nothing to forgivejust as he did when Sansa apologized for being awful to Jon during their childhood (query whether this has any significance?). Sansa is still furrowing her brow and not smiling; she averts her eyes again (3:35). Glover continues and eventually ends with an emphatic "The King in the North!!!" (3:55). 
The camera immediately cuts to LF, who seems to recognize that he has no control over how this situation is developing. LF turns his eyes and head turn to Sansa (3:57), who's paying attention to the scene and somewhat more in focus, but still not smiling. Jon seems surprised by the turn of events. But not unpleasantly so.  The whole hall suddenly erupts in shouts of DAKINGINDANORF!  Jon rises to his feet, his face is resolute and starting to indicate that he accepts what's happening. He's certainly not displeased. Sansa remains seated and still frowning (4:19). Jon turns to face her; he seems excited and pleasantly surprised. Sansa continues to stare straight ahead momentarily with the same expression (4:20).  Then she notices Jons gaze and turns her head to look up at him.  She gives Jon a brief smile (4:21) and turns away and averts her eyes. Her smile fades somewhat. Jon looks up at the hall, focused on the responsibility that he's just been given (4:27).  He takes several deep breaths. 

Cut back to Sansa as she surveys the hall (4:33). She has a small smile, but you can see a hint of something else there... disbelief, conflict, resentment.  It's not unalloyed pleasure. Sansa then makes eye contact with LF (4:34), who's wearing an ironic half-smile. He purses his lips slightly, seeming to say say, "see? I told you." (4:38). Sansa's smile vanishes (4:40) and her mouth falls slightly open, as if realizing something (4:42). The video I linked to fades to another scene after this point. 

Overall, LF seemed displeased and caught off guard by the turn of events that led to Jon being named King in the North. He's conspicuously unenthusiastic, and Sansa didn't seem particularly happy about it either. She went from mild amusement with Lyanna's speech to uncertainty and apparent dismay when the Manderlys and Glovers declared for Jon but failed to even mention her or her substantial contributions. When everyone starts chanting " DAKINGINDANORF!" her smile to him seemed feigned. Jon didnt think much of it, but feigning smiles is part of Sansas core skillset.  And the glances Sansa exchanged with LF were highly significantindeed, the idea that she was looking for LF in that moment rather than taking in the moment is itself telling.  I dont think Sansa was prepared for the idea that the North would overlook Jon's bastardy or the fact that she brought the KotV to support Jon's attack (the decisive factor). Theres some genuine internal strife to come between Jon and Sansa. LF won't give up after being rejected once. He will likely continue to try to manipulate Sansa and drive a wedge between her and Jon for his own ends. 

And he may well succeed.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) The Forsaken may have been foreshadowed by Dany's Vision in ACOK </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-23 22:13:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **[TL:DR]** ***The Forsaken*** **may have been foreshadowed in Daenerys' House of the Undying visions.**

Quick stub of a theory that I havent really seen discussed.  

I was recently re-reading Daenerys House of the Undying visions for unrelated reasons, and in the process, I made an association that wouldnt have been possible before reading *The Forsaken* chapter from TWOW.

Heres the specific part of Danys vision that Im talking about:

Then phantoms shivered through the murk, images in indigo. Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a womans name.... mother of dragons, daughter of death... Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow. A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd. From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire.... mother of dragons, slayer of lies... Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. ***A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly.*** A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness.... mother of dragons, bride of fire... (ACOK, Daenerys IV)

*AND*

***A dead man in the prow of a ship***, a blue rose, a banquet of blood... what does any of it mean, Khaleesi? A mummers dragon, you said. What is a mummers dragon, pray?  Jorah (ACOK, Daenerys V)

I havent read nearly as much discussion of the "dead man on the prow" bit of Dany's vision as of the "stone dragon" or the "blue-eyed king" parts, for example. So I was wondering if there was a prevailing interpretation of what the dead man on the prow vision means? If not, could it simply have been foreshadowing of *The Foresaken* and the events soon to follow? 

For me, Aeron being strapped to the prow of the *Silence*  immediately came to mind.  In *The Forsaken*, Euron at one point actually says, bind them to the prows, referring to Aeron and the other priests he'd taken prisoner. It's clear that they're going to be sacrificed and may die even sooner. The only part that doesn't quite fit is that Aeron isn't *standing* on the prow (Euron could be), but bound to it. Notably, in discussing the vision with Dany, Jorah says "*in* the prow," rather than standing on the prow. Another commonality between the The Foresaken and the House of the Undying scenes that just occurred to me is that these are the only instances (that I can think of) where characters experienced shade-of-the-evening-induced visions from the first-person POV. (Victarion had a gulp of shade-of-the-evening in AFFC, The Reaver, but he quickly spit it out before feeling any effects.)  

The most interesting part of Dany's original vision was this: 

eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. 

Smiling sadly seems to rule out Euron. Sadness-tinged happiness doesnt seem like an emotional state hes capable of experiencing. It seems more like something Aeron would feel at the end of a long struggle where he welcomed death as merciful relief and could die with a clean conscience having stayed true to his principles.  Hence, the bright eyesalthough bright eyes in his dead face could alternatively describe a state of undeath. Finally, eye*s* in the plural suggests no eye patchso most likely either Euron wouldn't have had it on, or it wasn't him. 

Grey lips could refer both to the fact that hes dead and that hes a Greyjoy. In fact, doesnt the word Greyjoy fit perfectly with the idea of smiling sadly?  

As for the broader significance, I honestly have no ideaexcept it would tend to show that whatever Euron is planning in TWOW probably matters for Daenerys end-game, since GRRM bothered to foreshadow it almost 20 years before, in ACOK, as part of one of the most scrutinized passages of the whole series. 

[EDIT:  When I originally posted this, I was thinking just about the imagery of the vision on its own, which I still think is remarkably similar to The Forsaken. But if the "bride of fire" bit also applies to and modifies everything after "slayer of lies"and it does seem that waythen there needs to be further interpretation. Thanks to the commenters below for helping to identify and refine the analysis of this key issue.

If Daenerys is to be the bride to the dead corpse *himself,* then I agree it's more likely Victarion. If, on the other hand, "bride applies to the *overall vision*, which is to be understood symbolically (in other words, if the horse, ship, and rose are symbols of Dany's suitors, and the corpse is just a feature on the prow of the ship symbolizing one of the suitors), then it's potentially Euron.  I don't see Dany marrying Aeron and wasn't suggesting that.] </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) Based on an acrobatic jump seen in the Episode 8 preview, someone else must have been stabbed on that bridge. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-07 03:00:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **[TL:DR] If Arya had actually been the one who was stabbed on the bridge in Episode 7, she almost certainly couldn't be the jumper in seen in the Episode 8 preview. But since Arya is, in fact, the likely jumper in Episode 8, either: (1) she wasn't the one stabbed; or (2) her ability to perform the acrobatic running jump will require a substantial in-show explanation (cue tinfoil).** 

I havent seen a dedicated thread on this so I thought Id post one. 

It seems like most of the theorizing about how Arya wasnt really the person stabbed on the bridge relies heavily on inferences about Aryas behavior seeming careless and out of character (e.g., walking around during daytime, letting her guard down, not carrying Needle, confidently brandishing gold, etc.). 

Without passing judgment any of these circulating theories, Id just point out that there is far more concrete evidence suggesting that something is seriously amiss about the bridge scene in Episode 7.  

In the [Episode 8 preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lamDqBXvk), we're shown the Waif being surprised to see someone (0:24), followed by a chase sequence where the Waif is tailing someone who then performs a very acrobatic jump (0:290:31). We dont see the jumpers face, but it's not that difficult to figure out who it is. 

Heres a [**composite image**](http://imgur.com/28noXef) of the Waifs reaction, the Waif running, the jumper mid-air.  All of this is from the Episode 8 preview. The part of the composite photo showing Arya's face is from set footage, presumably from during filming of the same scene. 

Clearly, the Waif is not the jumper based on her clothing (different color shirt that fits her form, different color pants). Yet, it seems rather obvious to me, based on the shirt color and flowing cut, that the jumper is Arya. This creates serious plot coherence problems if Arya was the one stabbed in Episode 7. 

Watch the jumper in the Episode 8 preview closely. Someone stabbed multiple times in the abdomen almost certainly wouldnt be able to do an all-out run faster than the Waif followed by that acrobatic jump, which heavily engaged the jumper's abdominal muscles. 

Im not really even basing this observation and conclusion on external knowledge. Rather, just look at what happened to Grey Wormwho was trained to be basically immune to painafter being stabbed *just once* by the Sons of the Harpy.  The stabbing happened in S5E04. In the immediate aftermath , [Grey Worm was weak and bed-ridden](http://imgur.com/sP6Ipza), barely able to move, with Missandei assuring him that hed fight again *one day*. 

Presumably months later, in S5E10, hes still limping and [needs Missandeis help to stabilize him as he walks](http://imgur.com/cUaKRu5).  Remember that when [Danys advisors decided what they were going to do in the aftermath of Daznaks Pit](http://imgur.com/DKlLx2y), Grey Worm couldnt accompany Jorah and Daario because he was too weak.  This is that expectation that *the show itself* has created concerning the recovery process for a stab wound to the torso.  So if the show is going to remain consistent with what we've already seen, it seems completely implausible for Arya to be able to pull off the run and jump after adrenaline from the original attack has worn off (shes had time to get help, clean up, and change clothes, at minimum). As many have pointed out already, besides excruciating pain and blood loss, Arya would likely be battling major inflammation and infection from the puncture of her intestines. 

It follows that there has to be more to this than a face-value interpretation of the bridge scene. Things cant be exactly as they seem. If they are, it would violate the internal consistency of the show.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) A meteor strike took out Hardhome. The map of Westeros provides surprising clues. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-29 18:03:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **[TL:DR] The description of the unexplained disaster at Hardhome six centuries before the events of ASOIAF hints at an impact by an asteroid or comet; and the [map of Westeros provides some subtle additional clues](http://imgur.com/JlffByv) that support this hypothesis when viewed in light of Earths own history of interplanetary bombardment.**

Re-reading the passage below recently in a thread, I was reminded of a hypothesis that came to mind when I first read ADWD:

Hardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night six hundred years ago when hell had swallowed it. Its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, **their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north.**

Afterward **ashes rained down on haunted forest and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year.** Traders reported finding only nightmarish devastation where Hardhome had stood, **a landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses,** blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement. ADWD, Jon VIII (Emphasis added.)

This imagery suggested either a volcanic eruption (I think the Doom of Valyria was an eruption of the Fourteen Flames, a [supervolcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano)) or an interplanetary impact (e.g., by an asteroid or comet).  A couple of the details, which Ive bolded above, point more toward an impact though.

*First*, when I read that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north, I thought of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBvotWfR3j4) (see, e.g., 0:48, 1:20-1:25). Brightness sufficient to light the night sky like the sun fits an impact better than an eruption, since an eruption would look like a red glow, not a sunrise. 

*Second*, "a landscape of charred trees and burned bones" immediately reminded me of [pictures](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0711/tunguska_kulik.jpg) Id seen of the [Tunguska impact in 1908](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event), which coincidentally, also took place in a far northern region dominated by Taiga (coniferous snow forest).  Apart from the [K-T impact]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) that famously ended the reign of the dinosaursand possibly the [Meteor Crater]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_Crater) in ArizonaTunguska is probably the most famous impact in the popular imagination.  Based on GRRM's description, its also roughly the size of impact, in terms of destructive power, that probably took out Hardhome.  Tunguska was shrouded in mystery for much of the 20th Century, and it's is the sort of thing GRRM might have in mind while trying to write about the effects of an impact while giving his readers a subtle clue.

*Third*, the final clue might be in the map of Westeros itself.  For the reason Ive already mentioned, after thinking about Tunguska, my attention immediately turned back to the K-T impact.  I realized that the bay near Hardhome could easily be an impact crater.  It was then that I first noticed curious similarities in the coastline around Hardhome compared to the Gulf of Mexico and Yucatn peninsulawhich is where the dinosaur-killing asteroid probably impacted. Ive overlaid maps of North America and Westeros with transparency. I have no idea of how the scales of the respective maps compare. I just tried to align them as best I could based on the common geographic features I noted. 

**Here is [the result](http://imgur.com/JlffByv).** 

As you can see in the map above, Hardhome, as well as the site of the possible Hardhome crater, is located on the northwest side of a peninsula protruding into a large gulf or sea at its southern endjust like the [Chicxulub crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater#/media/File:Yucatan_chix_crater.jpg).  I also noted some interesting similarity between the shape of Skagos and Cuba. The Hardhome crater is probably too large as shown on the map to be a Tunguska-sized event. Assuming that Hardhome *really is* the site of an interplanetary impact, this leaves two main possibilities:

1.	Hardhome was a *much* larger impact. Possibly an impact capable of inducing a  nuclear winter from all the debris launched into the atmosphere. It seems unlikely that such a large impact could have taken place in the last 600 years, as claimed in the legend.  But could it have been one of the causesor perhaps *the* causeof the Long Night or subsequent long winters?

2.	Hardhome was a Tunguska-sized impact, but GRRM overestimated the size of the crater that would be produced by such an impact, or deliberately exaggerated its size to give us a clue that we might not otherwise notice.  Unlike maps based on real landscapes, the map of Westeros wasnt determined by geological and other physical forces, but by GRRMs imagination.  So we shouldnt try to deduce causes of certain geographic features using mathematical calculations and physics equations (e.g., figuring out what size asteroid it would take to make a crater of a given size)but we can make inductive inferences based on a more generalized application the underlying concepts. When creating a fictional landscape, we often consciously or subconsciously turn to what's familiar to us for inspiration.

With that said, it's also possible that the bay around Hardhome might not be a crater.  This wouldn't rule out the impact hypothesis though, because an impact can cause tremendous damage even without reaching the ground.  Tunguska *itself* didnt leave a crater.  It was most likely caused by an [airburst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjJuMFQyNyw) of a comet, rather than an asteroid, and generated an explosion in the neighborhood of 15 megatons of TNT (i.e., about the size of the Castle Bravo, a large hydrogen bomb test about 1000 times stronger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima).  This would certainly [light the sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4LqqA4GdsY) hundreds of miles away [as if the sun had risen in the North]( http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/434-RF-12ITEM1.jpg). Additional Castle Bravo footage [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l18dKSlzOlM) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvDvN5oYoZw) (see 0:41-2:24, 3:24-3:35).

None of this is 100% conclusive. But I was intrigued and thought Id share anyway. Asteroids (such as the one from which Dawn was forged) and comets are explicitly mentioned several times in the books.  These could all be subtle clues by GRRM. Hopefully the tin (or should I say iridium) hasnt completely addled my brain. 

[*A preemptive note for the nitpicky*I realize that when an asteroid or comet reaches the ground, it's called a meteor*ite*, not a meteor; but here we don't know if anything actually reached the ground.] </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) The High Sparrow Checkmates the False Baratheon Dynasty </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-27 01:28:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **[TL:DR] Show HS is a cunning player of the Game who is in an excellent position to engineer the Lannisters' downfall unless Cersei is given an unearned reprieve from her folly.**

This discussion assumes that Cersei **will not** be successful in just locking everybody assembled for her trial up in the Sept of Baelor and burning the whole place down with wildfirea scenario which requires Cersei's opponents to make huge blunders, and lets Cersei off the hook far too easily for her own.  

The Episode descriptions of Episodes 6 and 7 have "Jaime fac[ing] off against the High Sparrow" and "the High Sparrow eye[ing] another target." These descriptions, when read together and taken to their logical conclusion, are big clues about the HS' ultimate plan:

1. Clearly, Jaime doesn't kill or topple the HS in Episode 6, because he wouldn't be in a position to eye *any* target in Episode 7 (being able to target anyone implies some retention of power by the HS). 

2. My guess is that the HS will reveal the Lancel affair, causing Jaimie to leave KL for the Riverlands.  That will leave Cersei and Tommen more exposed to the HS' ultimate plans (see below). 

3. The previews suggest that Tyrells will make their move in Episode 6thereby potentially sparking civil unrest from the HS' many friends and supporters, as Kevan Lannister had predicted. Per Jonathan Pryce's spoiler last week, Cersei possibly will not show up for her trial by combat. The HS might play up the bad optics of her no-show and potential trechery (as well as the interference with Margaerys atonement) to go for checkmate on the false Baratheon dynasty. 

4. Logically, the HS next target will be Tommen Baratheon. Or more specifically, his illegitimate throne. I doubt the HS has anything against Tommen personally.  He's basically a decent kid.  Yet, he's Cersei's enablerand the basis for Lannister power in Kings Landing. The HS surely knows by now that Tommen is an incestuous bastard.  Cersei didnt admit to her incest with Jaime prior to her walk of shame.  But the HS has not simply let that accusation slide. Rather, its one of the very crimes for which Cersei still faces trial (along with high treason and Roberts murder). And, by proving her guilty of incest, the HS lays the foundation to then directly attack Tommen's legitimacy.  

5. Although Tommen may not be a bad person in the HS eyes, the HS still thinks everyone's a sinner. He won't have any compunctions against attacking Tommen Baratheon's legitimacy to undermine Lannister (and Tyrell) rule. The HS most likely wouldnt punish Tommen *Waters* simply for being an incestuous bastard. But exposing Tommens illegitimate birth and using it to strip away Tommens kingship is another matter. What's more, he'd likely see it as doing Tommen a spiritual favor, given his views concerning the corrupting effects of wealth and the benefits of laying the truth bare for all to see (think of the HS extended conversation with Margaery about abandoning his profession as a fine cobbler to become a wandering monk).

6. The HS has shown himself to be extremely intelligent and an adept player of the game. He almost certainly manipulated Tommen into telling Cersei about Margaerys walk of shame.  He anticipated that Cersei would try to use this information to get the Tyrells to intervene to save Margaery.  So it stands to reason that the Tyrell intervention is likely part of the HS overall scheme.  As an added bonus, when the intervention goes badly or has unintended consequences (i.e., in accordance with the HS plan), Tommen may blame Cersei for betraying his confidence.  I think the HS may even have a replacement for Tommen in waiting.

Remember the HS verbal sparring match with the Queen of Thorns?

"Have you ever sown a field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. **You are the few, we are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few...."**

Similarly, when he confronted Jaime next to Myrcella's body, he said:
"We have no names, no family. Every one of us is poor and powerless. And yet together, **we can overthrow an empire."**

What "empire" do you suppose the HS is talking about here? 

Most immediately, the ruling "Baratheon" (Lannister) dynasty. And possibly even the whole system of hereditary nobility and landed privilege in the 7K. 

**Here's how I think the coming confrontation between HS and Cersei may go:**

1. Cersei doesn't show up for trialpossibly she sends unGregor instead.

2. The much-hyped Cleganebowl happens or it doesn't. In either case, Robert Strong is revealed as an undead monstrocity and Cersei, by extension, is shown to be cheating her trial by combat. Possibly, a plot to incinerate the Sept of Baelor with everyone inside is exposed. 

3. The HS holds a public trial for Cersei *in absentia*. This trial would be a wonderful cathartic juxtaposition to the play that Arya (and the audience) witnessed in Episode 5, which represents history as written by the Lannister victors.  Recall that Cersei is accused of incest and high treason (including in the death of King Robert). Theres no shortage of evidence of her guilt. The HS could bring witnesses who saw Cersei publicly destroy the letter from Robert on his deathbead appointing Ned Stark Regent and Lord Protector of the Realm.  Remember that Ser Barristan attested that the letter was written in Robert's own hand and bore his unbroken seal (maybe the HS even has the letter?) The HS could then offer evidence of Tommen's illegitimacyincluding possibly the genealogy studies that led Ned to conclude that Joffrey was a bastard.  Maybe he's obtained one of the hundreds of letters the famously-earnest Stannis sent to lords throughout the 7K? Possibly he produces witnesses or a paper trail of Cersei/Joffrey's order to kill Robert's bastards? To cap it off, for maximum dramatic effect, maybe he then produces Gendrythe lone survivor of that massacre. At the end of the trial, Cersei is found guilty based on this mountain of evidence, and is condemned to death. The HS further condemns Cersei of sacrilege for profaning Baelor's Sept with Ned's innocent blood to cover her own capital crimes against the Realm.

4. The smallfolk back the HS. The Lannisters aren't popular to begin with and exposure of their *coup dtat* won't go over well, to say the least. Recall the scene at the beginning of this season, where Cersei has unGregor bash in the head of that guy who was spreading rumors about her in the city. (Also recall the positive reception to the play in AFFC where the lions get devoured at the end by the dragon.) Foremost, think of Cersei's walk of shame and the hatred she inspired among the smallfolk. The HS has been playing a long game to discredit her, and this public trial would basically complete the job. The only thing left to do then would be to capture Cersei to impose the sentence.

5. To facilitate Cersei's capture, maybe the HS approaches the Tyrells and offers to annul Margaery's marriage to the bastard Tommen and pardon her brother? Since the Tyrells would have Margaery back (but not Loras) and Tommen's rule would be in jeopardy, the Tyrells would have strong incentives to switch sides before Cersei and Tommen's fall.  I could see losing Margaery being the thing that pushes Tommen over the edge to kill himself and/or murder Cersei in [fullfillment of the prophesy]( https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4k1rgb/spoilers_extended_theory_throwback_thursday/d3cfa57).

6. Riots errupt and quickly escalate into an all out civil war.  Maybe the HS intends to abolish the monarchy altogether and supplant it with theocracy. Possibly he's covertly allied with Danyherself a champion of the common peoplein the background (I see this as less likely since Dany will probably end up adopting the official religion of the R'hllor)? Or perhaps the HS produces Gendry, if he didn't already do so during Cersei's trial.  The HS could invoke the authority of the Faith to legitimize himor possibly he could convince Tommen to do it and then abdicate; there are all sorts of intriguing possibilities. The key is that a legitimization sanctioned by the Faith would likely carry weight, especially if the HS can deliver peace and an end to the popular revolt.  Gendry would be sold as someone who came from and would rule in the best interests of the smallfolk, but who is still of Robert Baratheon's blood.  This might be acceptable to the lords as a compromise less radical than a complete abolition of the monarchy and nobilitywhich the HS may be in a position to credibly threaten. The HS' revolution and "overthrow [of the] empire" would be basically complete. 

7. Having lost everything she holds dear, Cersei then incinerates (or attempts to incinerate) King's Landing with wildfire. But in the process, she's strangled by Tommen (whether living or undead) or by Jaime, and realizes she's fulfilled the prophesy.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Note: this analysis applies to the books and show.*

"You have Castle Black. My watch has ended."  Jon Snow 

=========================

Jon's mic drop was perhaps my favorite part of "Oathbreaker." What struck me was the definitiveness and resolve in Jon's declaration, which I think is justified. 

It's fairly clear to me that Jons death discharges his obligations to the Night's Watch. There's a colorable argument that it doesn't, of course.  But I think it relies on a strained "gotcha" interpretation of the words of Jon's vow.

First, a few comments regarding the analysis to follow. 

To me, the words of the Black are the most important factor in determining the duration and scope of the obligations Jon assumed. 

The Black is a solemn and time-honored oath that has been handed down for generations.  It receives considerable focus in the books.  Indeed, when it's sworn, it's prefaced with the statement, "**[h]ear my words**, and bear witness to my vow." (AGOT, Jon VI.) (Emphasis added.)  So I presumereasonably, I thinkthat the actual language of the Black matters.  

To interpret the Black, above all, I look at the objective and ordinary meaning of the words, and consider them in the context of the full vow rather than in isolation.  I also look at what people said about the vow in the books.  And if theres a latent ambiguity, I consider what the person saying the words understood them to mean at the time the vow was given, especially if their internal monologue is captured in the books. 

**Here are the operative provisions of the Black:**

**1. Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death.**

(This is the key language defining the term of the commitment, including its specific beginning and end points. Note that it says until my death not until I am dead, while I live, it shall never end, or something like and now my eternal watch begins.)

**2. I shall live and die at my post.**

(This specifies that the commitment is continuous. Your watch is not a work shift. There are no vacations. Rather, you live where youre stationed and the Watch becomes your permanent new home.  Youre a full-time nightwatchman until you die.)

**3. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.**

(Thistogether with the renunciation of all other lands, titles, and other rights that define a persons identity in Westerosdefines the scope of the commitment. The nightwatchman has no higher loyalties than to the Watch, and promises to lay down his life in the performance of his duties if necessary.  The subordinate clause of provision no. 3 (after the comma) reinforces that this obligation continues for the full term of the persons watch.  Notably, this clause expressly incorporates provision no. 1 into its meaning by referring to **this** night and all **the** nights to come. The referent of the this is the specific night on which the person swearing the vows watch begins. Likewise, note that the clause says all **the** nights to come not all nights to come.  Use of the definite article the strongly implies an earlier referent.   Disegarding the context of this subordinate clause is one of the key interpretative mistakes Ive seen made by people who think Jons watch lasts forever.)

Heres an annotated version of the above provisions that substitutes in the referents of the words it, this, and the":

1.	Night gathers, and now my watch begins. [*My watch*] shall not end until my death.

2.	I shall live and die at my post.

3.	I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night [*on which my night begins*] and all the nights to come [*until my death*].

**Further observations and analysis:**

	Recall that, as LC Mormont explained, the Black is said [a]t evenfall, as the sun sets and [while] fac[ing] the gathering night and that [f]rom that moment, [the person taking the oath] will be a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch. (AGOT, Jon VI.) Thus, Night gathers, and now my watch begins indicates a specific and definite commencement of the obligations under the vow. (AGOT, Jon VI.)

	The phrase and now his watch is ended, which is typically said ceremonially at the funeral of a nightwatchman, parallels the phrase and now my watch begins.  This further suggests a definite end date upon death.

	The Black is a promise to be on watch until ones death. By the objective meaning of the word "death"i.e., what a typical person in Westeros taking the Black would understand death to meanJon has factually fulfilled the condition of his oath. The Black asks the swearer of the oath to lay down his life for the Watch. Jon did that.  Keep in mind that one life is all the vast majority people ever get. Death is their end, so this issue never arises. Here though, it appears that death wont be end of Jon. But it's not like Jon just took a little nap and then woke up refreshed. Moreover, he didnt engineer his death or permit it to happen in order to avoid his obligations.  He was murdered by his own sworn brothers and subordinates. 

	Jon was (presumably will be in the books) brought back from death by extraordinary magical means. Resurrection was almost certainly not in Jons or anyone else's contemplation at the time the vow was originally sworn. So to the extent Jon played no intentional part in causing the fulfillment of the condition that terminated his oath, and his resurrection was itself not a deliberate pretext to avoid that oath, his oath shouldn't be given a meaning to cover that situation unless it is already unambiguously encompassed by the original words of the vowwhich it isn't here.

All of these circumstances matter, because when taken together, they tend to show that were not dealing with a technicality or loophole, but instead a straightforward application of the letter and spirit of the vow to an extraordinary situation.  If anything, stretching the Black to cover a person's unexpected life after death would be the real technicality or catch-22. Jon already paid the ultimate price for the Watch. Although he is free to re-affirm his vows in this new life, his original vow demands no more of him.
