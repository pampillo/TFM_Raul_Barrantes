<TEXT> That's awesome, it's a good place to live!!

Yes, saved as much as I could. My hobby/passion is in my vehicles. So honestly that was my first priority 2 years ago when I bought my nice one. The other is a daily purchased for less than a paycheck. I personally don't see anything wrong with financing a vehicle.

It's not that I've "arrived" either... I'm obviously not a millionaire. But I damn sure am proud of myself given that I didn't go to a formal college. Also, not so easy in the sub $100k budget. I've been putting offers on houses since last June, 95% of them get snatched up by investors before they would even look at my contract. I'm just excited man. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back when I was about 6 or 7, my mom and I had gone to Target to get some things while in town to visit my grandmother. Being that age, my natural tendency was to wander off and do my own thing. 

I happened to find a grasshopper that had wandered into the swinging automatic door area, so I crouched down (crawling on my hands and knees) to chase it. 

I was completely unaware of my surroundings, and someone was coming through the doors right next to me. The sensors automatically flung the doors open and the left side door wedged itself up on top of the three largest fingers on my left hand. 

Here's where the stranger comes into play. As I lay there on the floor of Target, screaming and bleeding out of my hand, a woman came through the now open door. She was very pretty, red hair with pale skin and wearing a nice scarf. She was the one who set off the automatic door sensors. She stared down at me like I was some disgusting, wretched animal that needed to be put down. 

I'll never forget the look on her face as she scoffed and kept walking past me without saying a word.

<TEXT> You guys have all seen them, usually American vehicles lifted to fit 30 inch wheels under the fenders, usually with a shiny paint job to match. 

My question is how do they lift these cars? Mainly how do they lift the newer cars that aren't body-on-frame like your typical [Box Chevy](http://imgur.com/a/UPpBR)? 

I've done tons of searching and cannot come up with anything like a "kit" that would allow for a 4-6" lift on a [Mustang](http://imgur.com/a/I7yDS) or a [Camaro](http://imgur.com/a/ItDd7) or a [Charger](http://imgur.com/a/4E22H) for some examples. 

Does anyone know? Anyone have any experience building one of these?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a dedicated track car, you'll find virtually no difference between a 2005 and a 2009 GT. Going to a 2010-2011 will essentially add 60-70% to your purchase price. If you've got the money, go for a 5.0 (2011-2014) but you'll be hard pressed to find one under $20k.


If it were me, I'd be looking at a 2005/2006 GT with around 100k miles that I could get for less than $10k. I owned a 2005 GT for a while and had plans to make it a track car myself. They can be made pretty light if you strip some unnecessary weight. The 5 speeds are nearly bulletproof based on my experience and you can build the 3V 4.6L up pretty cheaply if you can do the work yourself. 


Before I sold it, mine was making 306 whp with intake/tune/exhaust. I've seen others make around 400 whp with cams/headers etc... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had almost identical problems.

1. Finished the "race" time trail thing and at the finish line, there was no car to collect. (It timed out eventually and just counted as an unsuccessful pickup)

2. Two associates and I tried to sell 3 cars that had been modified individually per client's request. When we exited the garage, they spawned in their respective vehicles and I spawned on foot, rather than the T20 I was supposed to be in. No car to be found. 

After that, I quit the entire game and switched to Forza. Logging in later, I found that I apparently had 180k more (as my two associates had delivered their cars successfully) but the T20 was gone from my warehouse completely. 

Oh well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Under anesthesia for wisdom tooth removal around 16-17, I subconsciously became a racecar and proceeded to SCREAM my way through the gears.

Like, maximum volume yelling and escalating pitch, then off the gas, clutch with the left foot, and back on the gas for the next gear with an imaginary gear shift in my right hand. 

Waking up to people filming and laughing at you after you've been unaware of yourself for an hour is quite startling, they had to tell me what had happened.

<TEXT> Soap opera details unknown, so bear with me. 

In 1998-99 I was about 6-7 and there was a Days of Our Lives episode in the winter season. Part of the main premise was a beer can bring frozen in the pool that had iced over behind their house. I remember playing with my Christmas gifts while my dad watched intently, occasionally glancing up. 

The beer can was being held in place by a skeleton hand of one of the characters that was dumped in the pool after being murdered.

Scared the fuck out of me. 

I had to go to counseling at school, "drawing my fear" to help face it. I couldn't even look at snow or ice without breaking down and losing it. Eventually had some psychiatric therapy done in the nearest large town to help get over it. 

To this day I had zombie movies/shows/books, halloween, scary movies, anything that references dead people really.

<TEXT> I dropped acid a few times back in college. Made me a little more socially awkward, but oh my god did it open my mind. I'm absolutely the last person to advocate taking drugs but I learned so much about the universe and life during those trips. 

I have some stories if anyone is interested. 

/u/MirrorVision and /u/frenchybop have requested some stories so here we go. 

First Trip:
My first one was done out of a vape pen and it hit quick, there was no waiting for the come up. It was one and done. It was my only day trip and the colors were unbelievable. I felt silly, smiling for the entire duration with my room mate at the time. During that time I started to realize that there was so much left within the spectrum of existence that we couldn't comprehend in our normal consciousness. My most vivid memory was the trees being straight up BLUE and they all seemed to sway together. Beautiful. 


Best Trip:
This was my first night trip and I was with one of my best friends. He and I took it normal (blot sheets) and once it hit, the stars were so bright that I remember just going outside and staring at them and realizing we weren't alone. We couldn't be. The odds were too great for anyone to disagree. It was at this moment that I came to the greatest realization of my life. Cows. Cows brought me to tears. Because I thought about how we use every part of the cow to its fullest extent (except maybe bones but idk) and we breed them to consume in their entirety. 

Then I thought about how other planets way out in space must have some kind of harvester animal and I tried to imagine it but I couldn't! It was the craziest shit in the world and it blew my mind. The whole concept of "Space Cows" sounds so outrageous but there's no way they don't exist. My brain couldn't even picture them either, like I couldn't comprehend them. They could be in 4 or 5 other dimensions that humans can't even perceive. 


Worst Trip (and my last one):
Rather than the apartment setting of my previous trips, this one was in a large old house (essentially a trap house) built in the 30s. Visuals were very mild, with some wavy textures that gave an indication that everything was vibrating (at least for me) and I just remember the girl we were with having the most intense trip of her life, and it scared me. It was like seeing what can happen when you do acid every weekend. It took me to a place where I honestly couldn't talk. I couldn't think of anything to say. I've researched it out and I'm pretty sure I experienced what's called an [Ego Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death). 

I remember my buddy trying to get me to be more social by asking me, "Hey man those shoes are cool where'd you get them?" And I just couldn't respond. I shrugged and mumbled something incoherent then went to the stairwell to lay down (I don't know why). Laying down and closing my eyes only made things worse as I could now hear constant, very loud whispers of what I thought were words but I couldn't understand them. 


Sorry for the wall of text here guys lol. It does feel really good to get this stuff out there. I've never told anyone this. Not sure if this was the place to do so but ohhhh well. 

TL;DR: LSD can lead to anything from the discovery of Space Cows, to hearing voices of a 1930s trap house.  </TEXT>

Are there any tweaks that could make his happen if I were to jailbreak my phone?

<TEXT> Wow, great advice thank you. I'm definitely going to look for those signs next time I'm out. 

I have a core group who are very fun to be around, it's just tough to always hang out with adult lives and jobs. I also have a core group of Xbox friends and we hang out in real life occasionally. (All these mentioned are guys btw) 

New people like at car meets and stuff are usually pretty cool, I just always feel like the odd man out that's just present with no input/relations. I guess that's where you tips would come into play. 

Girls have always been strange, except for my girlfriends when I had them for a couple of years at a time. If I'm attracted to a girl, I stutter, my lisp comes back with vengeance, and I have no idea what to say. With a girl who's taken/not attractive they're literally the easiest person to talk to. 

Thanks for listening/reading. No one knows any of this about me.  </TEXT>

As for the glasses, I literally only wear them at my computer at work so I'm not straining, very light prescription and I don't use them any other time.
