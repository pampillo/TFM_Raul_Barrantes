<TEXT> The debate rages on.  
[Armstrong long insisted he did say "a man" but that it was inaudible. Prior to new evidence supporting his claim, he stated a preference for the "a" to appear in parentheses when the quote is written. In September 2006 evidence based on new analysis of the recordings conducted by Peter Shann Ford, a computer programmer based in Sydney, Australia, whose company Control Bionics helps physically handicapped people to use their own nerve impulses to communicate through computers, indicated that Armstrong had said the missing "a." This information was presented to Armstrong and NASA on 28 September 2006 and reported in the Houston Chronicle (30 September 2006). The debate continues on the matter, as "Armstrong's 'poetic' slip on Moon" at BBC News (3 June 2009) reports that more recent analysis by linguist John Olsson and author Chris Riley with higher quality recordings indicates that he did not say "a".](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong) </TEXT>

They believe that the party leaders are acting with their best interests in mind, so when the potus and speaker both say this is a good bill, they will follow and believe it is a good bill.

<TEXT> Wiki - [Gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)  
  
Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or members of a group, hoping to make targets question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.  
Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to Gas Light, a 1938 play and 1944 film. It has been used in clinical and research literature.

Nixon wasn't impeached because there was a break in (i.e. DNC hack), he was impeached because of the cover up. The cover up could break Trump, but there is so much evidence to support he and his campaign colluded with Russia to get him elected, the House and Senate could still go after him for the primary crime. And they should. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jack Reacher is a good one, I just think the movies fall short of what the source material provided. Tom Cruise isn't my favorite actor, but damnit he makes a good action movie. He's not Jack Reacher though. That character is, first of all, supposed to be tall, and for that character the imposing height was one of his important traits. He's also supposed to be much darker than the Cruise movies made him.  
But yeah, I agree. Apart from Bourne, and Craig's James Bond, there haven't really been any great action characters. No, I don't think the Marvel Characters are great. In 20 years, that shit will look really hokey. Try to watch X-Men 1-3 now. It's corny.  
Neo was great, but that's as much a sci-fi character as it is an action character. If we want to bring Luke Skywalker or Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard into the mix, we're going to have to have a much wider conversation.  
As far as pure action movie characters go, I'm not seeing much these days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd have to disagree with us having more high quality movies than the past. In their heyday, those movies were as high quality as any Transporter, Fast   Furious, Mummy, X-Men, or Bourne movie. Robocop, Kickboxer, Bloodsport, 48 Hours, Conan, predator, Total Recall, Lethal Weapon, they were all good quality movies at the time. The best of our current era will stand the test of time, but most will fade. Some will stand the test of time like Terminator (1 2), Rambo, Die Hard, and Aliens, but not many. Maybe the Bourne movies, Kill Bill, Skyfall, and a few others, but not many. </TEXT>

He doesn't have that one huge defining role. The Mummy and F F roles are popular, but tell me the names of his characters. Most can't. He's "The Rock," not The Terminator, Rambo, Rocky, Conan, or John Kimball.

<TEXT> I've definitely experienced the mower scenario. Ran over one in a pretty unusual are of the yard for a nest to have been, usually they were along the tree line or back in the woods, but this one was right in the middle. I knew immediately what it was, but I'm not sure if it was the stings or the swarm I noticed first. I threw the mower all the way up to "rabbit" but the yellow jackets are faster than rabbits it turns out. I jumped off, sprinted to the house and into my bathroom, stripped off my clothes and jumped in the shower. When I came out, 3 yellow jackets were flying around in the bathroom, so I had to run out of there too.  
13 stings, and a lot of panic. Fuck yellow jackets and wasps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. The government cannot pass any laws that would infringe on a citizens right to free speech. But organizations and the people that manage them can. Hell, if the FBI wanted to cancel a speaker at one of their events because the speaker's presence or speech might lead to riots, they could. That still wouldn't be a violation. Ann Coulter can go out anywhere that will accept her, or stand on any public area, and say whatever she wants.

Over the past 5 years or so I've started trying to see how long she can speak without me making a single sound. 4-8 minutes is pretty normal, but we've hit 11-13 minutes several times, and 16 minutes is her current record.  
She'll usually ask something long the lines of "how are things with you" at the end, but after about 20 seconds of talking, she's on again with a relatable "yeah that happened to me too, lemme tel you about it for 5 minutes" story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Blaming boomers as a group for this sort of stuff is just as lame as blaming millenials for whatever shit they get blamed for.  
  
What do millenials get blamed for? Being lazy and entitled? Sorry we expected what we were promised growing up, that if we studied and worked hard we'd have a chance at that ole American dream like our parents/grandparents did. You know, decent paying jobs like boomers had when they got out of college, reasonable student loan debt, a chance to buy a house and save for retirement. Not having to have both spouses working just to make ends meet. Yeah, those damn millenials.  
  
No, it's totally legitimate to blame the boomers. You know why? BECAUSE FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS THEY WERE THE ONES VOTING AND CREATING THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN TODAY.  The millenials inherited this mess and they're pissed, and they have only the boomers and Gen Xers (to a lesser extent) to blame. It's not like the millienials were alive or voting when it got fucked. That's a TOTALLY false equivalence comparing boomers to millenials. There's nothing you can blame millenials for. They're too young to have caused any institutionalized catastrophies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was talking to a friend who works on the Hill in DC last night, and he said this is the most common fear from people up there right now. Especially the terrorist attack possibility and Trump/Bannon taking advantage that to launch what would probably be total war against the perpetrator's nation(s).  
He did make a good point that the Trump team is probably not competent enough to pull off a false flag without getting caught. No one in the military/intelligence service would play along with them the way they might have with Nixon or any other previous potus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Isn't this old news?  
I mean, in the modern news cycle where a new Trump administration scandal breaks every day, didn't we find out about this one weeks ago?  
  
Gotta miss simpler times. Obama didn't have 1 scandal as big as...  
  

-Sessions purgering himself under oath about meeting with Russians  
-Flynn working as an unregistered (paid) foreign agent for Ukraine (on behalf of Russia)  
-Kushner's conflicts of interest and contact with Russia during the campaign  
-Ivanka's conflicts of interest  
-Ivanka saying she would be  "daughter" not a Trump administration employee  
-Trump's not so blind trust with his 2 sons taking over the family business  
-Trump not releasing his tax returns (despite saying on many occasions he would)  
-Kellyanne Conways lying about microwaves, crowd sizes, etc. (whatever happened to this woman anyway?)  
-Manafort (where to begin)  
-Carter page's contact with Russia  
-Trump's ties/debts to Deutsche bank  
-Allegations, ongoing lawsuit against Trump for sexual assault  
-Trump University settlement, except for the one woman that's still suing  
-Trump promising healthcare for all, but presenting a horrible healthcare plan that failed  
-The 2 failed Muslim bans that the administration now says weren't Muslim bans  
-Russia hacking the DNC to help Trump win against Hillary  
  
We could go on for days, there are so many scandals.  
  
edit: added a couple more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TBH, with all of the open racism, bigotry against jews ("jewish media/hollywood/elites," whatever that means), and encouragement of violence against different groups, I don't understand how TD hasn't been banned the same way fatpeoplehate and other subs like that were once. I'm all for free speech, but not hate speech, and TD has certainly crossed the line. People that aren't on Reddit, especially older friends I talk to, only know about Reddit because of TD, so they think this site is to blame (partly) for spreading Donald's message of hate and getting him elected. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trust me, I believe what you're saying. Fuck, I have a "Not me, US" print from the original artist framed in my bedroom.
I want what Bernie supports to happen. I donated to his campaign from June 2015-June 2016 for a reason, and followed him and Warren for 5 years before that. Warren would have been my preferred candidate because of Bernie's flaws, but what they both support for the most part is comparable. We are primed for universal healthcare if we can just make a few modest cuts to our military. We'd still kick Putin's ass in any non-nuclear war if it came to that (which it wouldn't, Russia is still just a fancy car with no engine under the hood, just like they were in the 80s. North Korea too.)
But right now, right this instant and until 2020, we have to be pragmatic. Do I think the Dems can sweep both houses in 2020 and win the Presidency with a solid pick like Warren, Sanders, Harris, Biden, or Schiff? Hell no. Not at this point. Not with Trump having a 36% approval rating. Ryan would be Gerald Ford at best. But right now, he's the best option. And he could keep some peace. We'll fight with him, but not like we have to with Trump. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Possible, and that would hurt him with a certain percentage of Republican voters who still favor Trump. But that percentage isn't as  large as it would have been on Nov. 8 when the biggest scandal was Hillary's e-mails (thanks to Comey a few days prior to the election).  
And keep in mind, the majority of the country, even after that, still favored Hillary.  
Ryan could be seen as a unifier if he plays his cards right. If he takes on radical right wing extremism from people like Putin/Trump he could bring many moderates on the left to his side. The Dems don't really have a leader right now, or a plan. Hell, that's why Hillary (a terribly flawed candidate) lost. And no, Bernie wasn't much better. he was equally flawed for being too far left.  
Ryan could bring this country back to the center, to a place of pragmatism, and in the end, peace.  
That's what we need right now, even if it's just for a few short years.  
  
And yeah, I get that Ryan is flawed. He's been bought and paid for many times over, but right now he's the best option. Pence is part of the Trump campaign. He is compromised as they all are. This whole thing is unprecedented, not just in U.S. history, but in the history of any democracy. We're living in a chapter of U.S. history right now. Let's get this impeachment done and keep that chapter as brief as possible. </TEXT>

It's pretty obvious that Putin didn't retaliate (verbally or with his own sanctions against us) because he thought (or was told by Sessions - we'll see in the testimonies) that Trump would be friendly to Russia and lift the sanctions.  
There's way more smoke here than there ever was with Benghazi or Obama not being born in the US, and your side had absolutely no problem going after Hillary and Obama for those.

<TEXT> To equate the two right now would be unfair. The GOP is in bed with Russia via Trump/Manafort/Sessions/Flynn/Kushner/Page/Conway's husband/etc, not the DNC. The DNC gets accused of shady shit just like the GOP used to, but this is a different level. The GOP is the villain here, not the 2-party system. We can go back to debating traditional GOP/DNC probems after this President is impeached and normalcy is restored. It's a total false equivelancy to say they "both bad" at this point though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't matter if it's nuts, it's the truth. It always has been. How are people just waking up to this? Conservative Christians think that the Jews will go to hell because they don't believe in Jesus, but at best, they still want to protect the Jews from persecution via Israel because WWII makes Americans feel warm and fuzzy, and we're all against the Muslims. That last part leaves them conflicted between their belief in salvation only through Christianity, and their love of the USA as hero/Jewish liberator in WWII. They definitely want to look out for the Jews, in the same way an owner looks out for their pet dog, but they don't want any Jewish influence on the conservative white Christian foundation the U.S. was built on in their minds. </TEXT>

No, Ben. That's not what they had a dream for. They dreamt of going home, of being reunited with their families and loved ones. They dreamt of not being beaten and forced to work for a country they neither knew nor loved. The 20th century American dream you're painting was not even close to what they wanted.

<TEXT> I'm glad the CNN president spoke out. I wish the network executives would come out strongly more often. It's never happened before, but if the presidents, owners, and CEOs of major organizations would go on camera to defend their organizations, and stand in front of their reporters, it would give the reporters a lot of cover to hit hard on their investigative journalism. And that's what we need right now. I believe it would also drive their ratings if the execs can come across as likeable and strong in their addresses. They are the 4th estate, and right now, we need them to be stronger than they've had to be in 200+ years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Trump Effect is energizing people to pay attention to politics for more than just the last 6 months of an election, to get to understand the 3 branch government, who their Senators and House representatives ([there are 2 houses of Congress, people, and they're all elected by you every 2-6 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_2018)) are and whether they like their senators or not, so many things. And in 4 years, 4 more years worth of liberal-leaning millenials pissed off about Trump's racism, stupidity, narcissism, and ignorance will be able to vote. And they will be the most informed 4-year block of young voters in American history. If Trump's deplorable behavior  can energize the youth to vote for the first time in American history, he will have unintentionally done 1 thing right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived in Chattanooga, TN for a time and can tell you without a doubt, the city itself is about as progressive as any other city in the Southeast, but the surrounding area is about as conservative as any other area in the country. Getting Bob Corker out, even after his gaff over the VW plant where he lied about VW pulling jobs out of the state if the employees unionized, it'll be a chore. There's no realistic challenger at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He can't though. That's the problem. I don't mean there isn't an argument to be made (I cant think of one), just that Trump doesn't have the ability to make that argument. He doesn't understand how to debate, he only knows how to throw temper tantrums and lash out. He's the "nuh uh!" kid that didn't believe the earth was round "because I don't." He's the "because I said so" parent that doesn't explain to their kid why what the kid did was wrong when they punish their child.  
Trump understands how to rule as a dictator where whatever he says goes, but he doesn't know how to work with others or express himself thoughtfully. </TEXT>

As for whether it was required to perform the job? Nah. Not really. No, I didn't get the job. They thought I'd leave within 6 months if I could find something better than a teller job.

<TEXT> I agree completely with what you're saying, Republicans will probably back him because the controversy of an impeachment could destroy their party when they were lucky to have won this Presidential election and both houses of Congress anyway. I'll always wonder how the Dems not only lost the Presidency, but didn't gain both houses. I mean, I know why. We ran a weak candidate. But the opportunity was there.  
No, I think the Republicans will fall right in line and back their President while speaking out in his favor as little as possible.  
But, if there was an impeachment, it's best that he gets impeached by his own party (given they have majority in every house and will have the Supreme Court). It keeps the Dems from taking all the blame and possibly dividing the country further. Make no mistake though, a Trump impeachment would require the Republican party to fall on it's own sword, and I don't see that happening. If it did though, it would be the most patriotic act by a group of Americans in 100+ years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think Pence is a true and total sociopath. We throw that label around a little too liberally sometimes, and narcissism too. I disagree with Pence on so many issues, especially his stances that abortion should be outlawed and creationism taught in schools, and maybe he has an absurdly over-inflated ego because of the position he holds now, and the position he's held as an upperclassman his whole life, but I don't know if he's a full blown sociopath. He'll push for legislation I don't agree with, and he might even get some things passed I wouldn't like, but he'll never get Roe V Wade overturned even with a conservative Supreme Court, not without a major fight from the rest of the country. And he'll never get creationism and prayer to become a public school requirement.  
Trump though, he really is a narcissist. And he very well might be a sociopath too. He needs approval, he can't take criticism, and he has the means (now more than ever) to take revenge on anyone on the planet he feels has disrespected him. And yeah, he has illustrated very clearly that he has little more than an elementary level understanding of our legislative process, country history, or understanding of current global affairs. That is dangerous. Pence would sting, but Trump could blow the whole fucking thing up in months. </TEXT>

Just when there's no XM stereo or iphone/android/ipod device plugged into the car stereo (and would be pretty unusual). Most of the time if there's none of that, they'll just pull their phones out and make/watch videos, take photos, browse  social media, or just listen to music on their phones without the car stereo. I'd bet most teenagers can't name a single FM radio station in their area. NPR is still a thing though. A lot of teenagers and 20-somethings listen to that. They just get it on their smartphones/tablets/laptops. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That child is well on his way to being morbidly obese as an adult. Maybe Santa made him cry a little today, but maybe tomorrow the kid will want to never go through that again, and start trying to eat better. Doesn't sound like his mother is going to encourage healthy habits though. She's going to keep him in his cheeseburger filled safe space where no one cares about his health, but everyone cares about his feelings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are less destructive ways to screw with someone who does this. Unscrew the valve stem cap on one of their tires, insert very small pebble, put cap back on. It'll drain the air without damaging the tire. But it can screw up the valve stem, so don't screw it on too tight.  
I did that once to a guy who came up the wrong direction in a parking lane where I was waiting for a spot. The other car left their spot, and asshole cut me off and made a 5 point turn to steal the spot.  
I ran into him at the back of the grocery store and said something like "that was really uncool, man. You saw me waiting for that spot." He responded with something like "fuck do I care. I got where I needed to be."  
I cut my grocery shopping short, checked out with what I had, walked outside and deflated 2 of his big truck tires and left a note under his wiper that said "good luck getting where you need to go now." It was a total dick move on my part, and I probably should have been the bigger man, but sometimes those baser instincts get the best of me. </TEXT>

For a second I considered Dolph Lundgren (the man's a god damned artist), but it has to be [Chris Pratt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOpePo5Lx_I). I mean, [seriously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGCIGEUB32M). How can you say anyone is more gifted? And that's what it is. A fucking gift. Suck it, Tom Hanks. Eat it, DiCaprio.

<TEXT> Not just traditional bubblegum pop music either like you might hear on a Top 40 Station. Country music is terribly generic too. I love this [6 song mashup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8SwIvxj8o) with country songs all made into 1 continuous song that makes as much sense as any 1 song would have on it's own.  
Rap wasn't much better in the 2000s. Thankfully, every once in a while a genre gets a Nirvana, Kendrick Lamar, a Townes Van Zant, and gets a reality check on what is and what is not art. </TEXT>
