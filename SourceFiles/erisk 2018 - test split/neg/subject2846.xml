<TEXT> If we can re-sign Hayward and get Kyle Lowry, I wouldn't mind letting Hill walk. I just don't know what else we would need to get past the Warriors. I think the only team that has a chance is Portland. If they had a healthy center, and could add PG13 or maybe Hayward they could take them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 11/22/63 by Stephen King is really good. It's long, but it is a pretty easy read. One of my favorite fantasy series is The Kingkiller Chronicle. They are really good, easy to read, and get your mind working a little.

 You could also try the Longmire books, they are like western cop mystery books, and they have a tv series as well. If you really want to test your comprehension, read through Dune. Science fiction, interesting, but not a page turner for most of the book, with the payoff literally within the last 100 pages. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. I think the book is meant to be ambiguous in how they talk because near the end you aren't supposed to be able to tell who is talking. As for the ending, I think it is the perfect ending. The boy gets lucky, and continues on, just like he and his father had before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What a beautiful, terrible, wonderful book. The story is compelling yet grim, and even though we know that death is inevitable, we push through to the end to see how it all unfolds, which is what I enjoy most about this book. 

Our deaths are inevitable, and perhaps it would be easier to be spared of the cruel way the universe seems to have planned for us to pass into the next phase of our existence, we push through, clinging onto the hope that perhaps death can come upon us while we sleep, in some peaceful manner.

I think it gives us a perfect snapshot of the gritty nature that propels us as a species to survive, even in the harshest circumstances. What a fantastic, horrible, wonderful book. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. There are a few classes that I would consider the "Great Separators". Gen Chem 2, O Chem 2, and Physics. Study through those if you really want to go to med school.

2. Just because you have your mind made up now doesn't mean you can't change it. You might find something you love to study, don't be afraid to change your path. 

3. Have a backup plan. Things might not always go your way, and having a fallback is a good idea.

4. Connections are important. Learn to make friends, network yourself, get to know your teachers, show up to office hours, apply for research positions, etc.

5. Part of being a healthy human being is having sex, but so is maintaining a healthy mind. Take care of your mind, don't let your hormones take control of your brain, and vice versa. Balance in all things, yo.

6. This is the big leagues now. Grades matter, and failing a class and retaking it is bad. Don't be an idiot in that regards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There came a point when it became a huge wedge in our relationship. Religion was a top priority for both of us, and she didn't see the problem with me stopping going to church h and just going with her. 

Eventually she would say things like me not being Christian, asking if I believed in multiple Gods, and asking about Joseph Smith with very pointed and derogatory questions. It became very clear she had been googling Mormonism and reading the most salacious articles. We broke up not long after all this, for.multiple reasons. </TEXT>

I disagree with your sentiment and believe if you haven't read the material supplied by OP,  you should not comment, mainly bevause you are being critical of the author in a post that has nothing to do with his other works aside from the character featured.

If this were a post about his books, I would have nothing to say, but because this is a fanfic, and no reason exists for your comment other than to be negative, I don't see any value in it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add on to your character analysis, it bugs me soooo much that the main characters are very other paragons of virtue, which is one reason why I enjoy the story in the video game "The Last of Us".

Characters in dystopian/post apocalyptic societies should not be completely moral or immoral. They should be in the immense grey that lies between good and bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mostly because people have an unreasonable hate for the author. When you get used to Brandon Sanderson or Stephen King or someone similar who pump out these huge books in record time, you start to set unrealistic expectations for when a book should be finished. 

I have heard people compare this series to Lord of the Rings  (rightfully so, IMHO) and they dont realize how much work it takes to produce a work like that. 

Hop on over to the subreddit and see all the bitching and moaning they do because Rothfuss does anything besides sit in front of his computer and write (heaven forbid he have a life, or develop a board game that hails from the book, or write something that isn't KKC). 

But yeah, I would say this is definitely a great book, series, and a great middle ground book for those looking into some middle/high fantasy. </TEXT>

For your heart to sway.

As much as I care, 

I must forbear

To beg and plead,

For I have no need

Or friends with which I can share.

 

Ho! What pain! 

For though I long to be with thee,

My beloved one,

Time and space and precious gold

Keep thee from mine supple grasp.

I long for thee, thine crafted beauty.

And though I wait, for surely my luck

Hath run low betimes, I hope and pray

That on this day, my luck will change

And bring thine hard edges

To rest with me. </TEXT>

Picked up basketball again when I moved to downtown Salt Lake and lived so close to the Arena. Randomly started playing 2K and could not figure out a team that wasn't a nightmare to manage.

 Liked the blazers core so I decided to gm them, and then I actually started watching the games in real life, right around last year's playoff run. I was hooked. Edging off the Clippers did it for me, fan for life now! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great school! Don't worry about going to BYU. Having spent some time at BYU and other church schools, and now working on my undergrad at the U, the experience is night and day. I love it way more than the church schools for a host of reasons, most being the restrictive rules. My feeling are that if you have a testimony, the rules they apply to everyone will be obeyed. 

As for a mission, since I'm piggybacking your post, I would say wait and reevaluate, but be aware that spending time in a place like SLO will expose you to some parts of life that could lead you away from the church if you are not careful. 

I would say, having had some exposure to anti material and doubts at your age as well, and having served a mission after resolving them, that a lot of the material is put out by opponents of the church who spin material to make Joseph seem a lot worse than he was. 

And in true missionary spirit, I would say that the key to knowing he is a prophet is praying about the veracity of the Book of Mormon. So yeah. But having doubts is normal and human! Don't feel alienated because of it.



Also, go Giants! :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing that worries me about it is that when they eventually pull out of Syria ( all under the pretense that we stop contesting them) we will have the same power vacuum that existed in Afghanistan after the USSR left in the 70s, which will give some fringe groups the ability to take over and control Syria.

I think a global solution is needed, because every western country's security becomes an issue when a large extremist government is allowed to dig itself in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's just back this up for a sec. Given the situation that this thread is, I think it is pretty clear why I have been insisting that the Word of Wisdom has one very specific interpretation, based on modern revelation. This is a core doctrine. It is so important that it is in temple interviews, and the prophets have given us a very specific definition for what it means.

The gospel is wonderful, and amazing, and everyone is welcome to interpret a plethora of scriptures, modern revelation, and personal revelation as they see fit, and that is what is great about the church. 

If this thread was discussing how we feel about commandments, or cultural differences in what is acceptable to ingest, then maybe I could see these comments being appropriate. This thread is an investigator who is trying to do what the missionaries have taught them. 

Giving advice that directly goes against what the doctrine means and advocating things like lying in TR interviews, or to the missionaries, and continuing the ingestion of substances prohibited by the WoW, and thus, leading the person away from what is being taught, is apostasy. 

You can have your own qualms with what it acceptable or not, and that is between you  and the Lord, but what the Church teaches on the subject, and this subject in particular, is black and white. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Come to Church! There is nothing wrong with you attending. Just realize there are set commandments that dictate what is acceptable and what is not. And those tenants are not likely to change. Doesn't mean we won't welcome you, but asking others to accommodate your personal decisions in spite of what a set rule of beliefs for the church is asinine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, it's not ok. These people have problems of their own with doctrine (which is cool, live your life howver) are not willing to admit it to themselves. 

The church has set guidelines for what is right and wrong. There are a lot of people here trying to rationalize their choices by quoting scripture and trying their own interpretations to it. On other scriptures, that is fine. This particular scripture, the Prophets God has ordained have said is meant to mean coffee and teas made with the tea leaf (black, green, white and oolong), hot or cold.

No where do they say anything about caffeine, mate, hot chocolate, or anything like that. It's just a fuss made by members. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you are trying to blur the lines for yourself and justify your habits on this one. 

I get that substitution is not much better, but when you are asked by the bishop about obeying the word of wisdom as interpreted by modern day prophets, you will not be breaking it by having soda or caffeine. 

As far as tea, it is the tea leaf that causes any sort of problem in the word of wisdom.

Caffeine was never the problem. It is the other things and ultimately obedience that is the bottom line of the word of wisdom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> High ave is right off the freeway and soooooooo close to downtown. It is my back yard, and there is already a lot of crime because the apartments around here are income restricted. Not to mention it is going to be a men's shelter. 300 homeless men 1 wall away from an apartment complex in a neighborhood that is already known for high crime rates is not a solution.

Putting the burden on the rest of the county would help. Also, not letting other states ship homeless folks here, or cleaning up the downtown drug trade in an actually effective way. Or building more affordable housing so families who are homeless can afford to rent in SLC where they work.

The citizens are getting the shaft so developers can make money, and there is no where to go. Everywhere slightly convenient or close to Trax is a small fortune just to rent, and there are a lot of complexes that are maintaining high prices and keeping apartments empty.

Let's address the other problems first. </TEXT>

He took his SD card with him for a point and shoot, and so I went and bought a 32 GB SD card. It shows a memory card error everytime i boot up the camera. As far as i know he was using a similar capacity SD card. Any ideas on what to do?

I assume the camera is updated, firmware-wise, he has used it for awhile now. Even if it werent, i dont have a cable to use to hook it up to a computer.

Ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> 900 is about the cheapest we can find. Salt Lake, where I live, is in the middle of a boom, rent has risen by over 200 bucks in the last year. We are repaying phones, but if both were repaid, after fees, taxes, etc the phone bill is still 150. I've looked into replacing phones, T mobile doesn't allow jumping to a cheaper phone once you are in a higher tier. 

The furniture we have is (mostly) secondhand or homemade. The only new things are a TV shelf and a new desk, and a queen sized mattress, which neither of us had beforehand to reuse. We have already sold a car to reduce the cost associated with owning it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey folks. Need advice, and i really have no clue what to do. 

To start, ill give a run down on the sticky situation we are in. I am a college student, and graduation is probably around 2 or 3 years away, before i start med school (hopefully). My wife works a full time job with benefits and an approximate salary of 29,640 or 14.25 an hour. I work, but recently quit my job due to personal injury.

We have a combined credit card debt of about 5,000 dollars, coming from a lack of prudence when buying furniture, housing stuff, etc, when we first got married.

Our monthly expenses are as follows:

Phone bill ~$200

Gas and Electric ~$75

Rent: ~$875, this is the cheapest place we can find, income restricted housing.


Car Payment and Insurance: $~310

Credit card payments total at about ~$150 for everything, and i have one outstanding balance with Verizon that i thought would be covered by our phone company when we switched, but ended up not being covered, which is about $500 dollars, and is in collections.

I get my student loans this week, which is what i was planning on using to ease our burden financially, but i dont know how to spend it. It will be about 2,000 dollars before books, lab equpment, etc, which i think will leave me with around 1600 to 1700 dollars.

Obivously im going to pay off my collections debt before anything else,  and after that, we have 3 credit cards, almost all maxed that need to be paid down. one with a balance of 3000, one with a balance of 1500, and one with a balance of 500. 

My plan was to pay off the 500 dollar card, and as much as the $1500 balance as possible, then using our tax refund to pay off the rest of that and as much of the $3000 balance as possible.

We are trying to work on our credit so we can refinance our car loan, and here is where the plot thickens.

We are upside down on our car loan. We bought a car from Carmax at what was "slightly above market price" and ended up getting royally screwed when we found a few problems that manifested themselves after the initial return date. Long story short, the current loan is for 9000, the car is valued at 5,000.

With all of this, i just need some advice on where to go. My wife might get a raise if she applies for the new position in the company that could put her around 35,000 salary. We have meals planned out and a monthly budget started, but there is just so much that we are starting to feel lost. :/

Any advice would be fanstastic, else this is just a rant of helplessness ha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mother is a principal. She once caught one of her first grade teachers dictating test questions and answers to her class, which she said was a huuuuge no no. This teacher, if not for tenure, would have been fired. 

So I would say teaching the test, no. Teaching things like the test, probably.

Note, the test was an official district test that is used for all first graders, and wasn't subject to change. So she was just having them memorize the answers to get better scores to keep her job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, time for round 2! 

First, one of my companions stories. He was opening an area known for macumba (a brazilian religion called candamble, kind of like voodoo, channeling spirits and whatnot) with a disobedient companion as his senior. They get into the home and never bless it. The first two weeks he is there, he wakes up at 3:33 every night. Finally, one night he wakes up like usual, but there is a dark thing standing over his companion. He is too terrified to do anything. His companion wakes up, and sees the thing, and makes eye contact with my buddy. The spirit leaves, they get up, and there is goo all over the other missionary's face. They dedicate the house, he slept well the rest of the transfer.

One of my own, very briefly is meeting who I am sure was a friend of mine from the pre-existence who chose to follow lucifer, in a dream. He was sent to try and invade my body. i remember having a dream of being held under water and then it moving to seeing him. He was naked from the waist up, bald, and had a very evil look to him. Interestingly enough, i had the most spiritual experience of my mission almost directly after this.

A more light hearted one now! At the married housing at BYU, a man and woman were being intimate. The wife was undressed and tied and the husband, wearing the costume of the Gotham Knight, is here to save her. While leaping from the dresser, he hits his head and falls unconscious. The wife is tied and cant help, so starts shouting. A concerned neighbor comes to the rescue, and thus lives this story.

Another one, and i believe this is in an older (i.e. Seventies) Ensign, where it talks about an eye witness to the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum. The reason the body wasnt desecrated was because when the mob approached the body, a man was struck by some sort of lightning, and ran off, and was cursed to run until he died. 

Another, Gordon B Hinkley mentioning that one of the Three Nephites was in attendance at conference.

I think we all know about the White horse prophecy, Cain being bigfoot, some other tidbits that may or may not be legit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess I'll go first!

The first is the first MTC story I ever heard. I knew some elders in my zone who were going to Mozambique and they knew elders going to the Congo. Apparently someone knew someone who said careful for voodoo then told them this story.

" Two elders were riding bikes down a road in the middle of the jungle when the one behind hits a rock and falls, breaking his arm. The first elder was aways ahead and when he turned around to look at his companion, there was a shaman who ran out of the jungle, and was standing over his companion. When he gets back to his companion the guy runs back into the jungle. His companion, whose arm was broken, is now healed. They rush to the mission presidents office, who immediately gives the elder a blessing to remove the black magic the man performed on the elder. The minute he ends the prayer, the arm snaps."

If you are doing it right. It should go like this.

Her: "Wow, you play guitar! That's awesome! I wish I could play!"

You: " it is actually not too hard. Here, I will teach you something!"

At this point, you hand over the guitar. Teach them something like a C chord or something else mega basic. You can touch their hands without it being weird. The rest of it will go like this.

Her: "Wow, I'm not very good."

You:" It just takes practice! If you want, I can teach you some more!"

From here, if she is interested in you at all, she will say sure. Set up a meeting, have fun, go on a date, the rest is history.

This has worked more for me than a few times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not by any means a Trump supporter. I tolerate him at the very most. Regardless, a lot of his economic and refugee policies are not bad. 

The fact that he isnt going to tear down Obamacare completely also has swayed me in to believing that he wont be terrible. If he backtracked a little on abortion, tweaked his tax plan, and decided to reform his immigration stance to include a way to amnesty, then i could see myself rooting for him, and i think that would earn a lot of support from moderates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If a conservative party came around that was pro science and socially moderate, i would hop on that train.

One of the various problems with Republicans is that they have worked really hard to "brainwash" their base. If any party came along to try and take their place, their media would crush it with their inflammatory stories on websites like the blaze, drudge, etc. They wield this conspiracy laden media sword and the base attacks where the sword points.

I cant remember the last time I had a political talk with my father, a very educated man, and he hadnt mentioned something about Obama being the worst president, or that solar or wind power, or global warming was something that was exaggerated by liberals and their cohorts to make money. 

The claims really have no base, but people eat it up. They pander to a lack of critical thinking and to the poorly educated. They pander to fear and veiled racism and to the "us vs them" mentality. 

The tools to fight the problems we have are the tools they keep from the people. Educated, healthy adults with a little perspective could change the world, but the republicans fight that. Cut education, fight for a lack of health care, and close your ears to anyone who shares an opinion that differs to yours. It is a toxic way of doing things, but it seems to be working for the people who have read into it. 

It took me two years living outside of the US in a poverty stricken country, and coming back to really see how many of our resources we spoil on other wasteful things when we could be helping the citizens of our country.

rant over i guess. I get so upset about this kind of stuff! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look. I understand your point. I understand your argument. I agree that empirical evidence is king. I agree that the big bang happened. I agree with almost all of your argument. But you cannot discredit someone's argument because of your own belief. Let's stress that.

Just because you don't believe in some form of deity, does not mean that it does not exist. Science does nothing to disprove the existence of a creator or diety. 

The absence of knowledge shouldn't not immediately point to diety. But not acknowledging the possibility makes your just as foolish as I.

Things do happen randomly. Quantum physics is right. I don't think anyone is jumping at every single random occurrence and pointing their fingers at it claiming some higher power is responsible. But perhaps some things can be the work of a diety and some things cannot.

There is grey area here. You cannot deal absolutely with something that bases itself in uncertainty.

Also, it appears from your comment history that you are a prick. Copy pasta is great. Have a nice night. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha you got me. Perhaps it isn't the correct choice of words. God exists unbound by time, in the sense that time is insignificant in His existence. 

I like to compare his existence to the scene inside the black hole in interstellar. It isn't that time doesn't exist, it is that it ceases to exist in the linear form that we view it. It becomes more like a book with infinitely many pages, where each page has some defined time, and that can be flipped through in any combination of ways possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that your argument can be countered in the same fashion. We can say that we don't know what was happening at the time of the big bang and thus the possibility of a creator exists. You are limiting your view of the creator as a traditional judeo- Christian Ood who directly intervenes for his people all the time. 

While ai am a Christian, my view is more that God intercede only when he needs to, but generally let's the world play out as if there was no design. He set parameters (ie defining the laws of physics, gravity. Etc) and just let it play out over billions and billions of years. There would be small examples of intercession (the first living cell) which could also just be that anything that can happen will eventually happen. There are small pokes along the way to keep life progressing to the state he wants it, but generally it is just the universe acting upon itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first question is not super clear, but im assuming you are talking about polygamy. I'm not going to try and defend polygamy. I think that every single person makes really bad mistakes and that this was one of them for him, which is why we don't practice it today, and why it was repealed. And I don't know what exactly you are referring to when you say that this plane of existence is based on sexual behavior.

Aso for tithes, which I assume you are referring to. Everything on this earth costs money. You really can't do anything without it, whether it be a creation of man or God. So things like building churches, giving humanitarian relief, building temples, and the upkeep, of each of these things costs money. Tithing, 1/10th of what I earn, goes to taking care of God's kingdom on earth. We don't have any paid clergymen, so I'm not paying a salary to anyone. Merely giving back a portion of what God has given me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mormon here, we actually have doctrine that explains this in a way.

As mortals, we notice time, and we measure it. As a God, He has no time. He moves through the iterations of earth as if it were a filing system. Meaning He can be omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. 

Further, human life has always existed on a plane outside of what we know, that would be matterless. We existed as intelligences, or unorganized spirit. God organized our intelligences into what would be a spirit, and then taught us more.

Without going into a very long spiel, we are the way we are, and have choices to believe or not, because ultimately, to have the choice and to choose to do good qualifies us for Godhood, and that in the same way our creator created us and his multiple children, we will also have the opportunity to do so given that we qualify.

If you wanted to know more PM me. It goes really deep, but is one of the more satisfying answers to the questions of my soul. </TEXT>

In my personal opinion, God is an author and creator, but not particularly an interventionist. I do believe we are his children and will intervene slightly, but for the most part he just sets parameters for the universe and lets it exist. 

Another thing, I don't think humans are the only intelligent life in the universe and that the God of our World is actually the God of many worlds, with such massive distances between us that we would need faith to believe rather than just comparing notes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* I want to run games like Skyrim, Civ V and Civ VI, as well as some FPS games without any lagging on high.Eventually it would be cool to run VR as it gets less expensive.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* .Less than $800, I have to talk the missus into this.

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Within the next few months. Im not looking for cutting edge, i just want to run games the way they were supposed to be played. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* Everytihng except a monitor.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* Im in Utah. so no.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I have a 22 inch 1080pmonitor, but will also be using my tv as a screen which is 4k.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* I think the answer to this is yes? I really dont want to make any major changes for the next few years, this is a big purchase and it will be tough enough to justify it to the wife.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* Enough RAM and a SSD to keep me from ever waiting or dropping below 60+ fps

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Keep it as plain jane as possible. Black is just fine. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* Its possible, but my university might offer it free. I have also thought about running Linux. I think Windows 10 home would be good though

**Extra info or particulars:**
I know this was probably super vague, but im not trying to be too crazy. I want a system that runs fast, and plays well, without too much of a hit to the pockets. I dont need cutting edge anything, but i would the possibility to play games for the next few years without needing a major revamping. VR is optional, if it drives the price up quite a bit.

Thank you kind sirs! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. Meth users are not the same as potheads. I have never seen a pothead sell their couch, fridge, and bed frame to be able to afford meth, then resort to cooking over a fire in their back yard because they decided to sell their stove.

I have never seen a pothead violently lash out at neighbors, passers-by, or anyone else for not being able to get their fix. I have also never seen anyone overdose on pot. 

Meth is nasty. It ruins lives. Pot does not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I will see if I can give you some answers.

1. The classes are pretty standard and in all honesty it depends on what you are studying. There are some classes you can coast through, and others that will take all you've got, even in generals.

2. I have yet to not get a class I want, and that was with forgetting I needed to register until 3 weeks before school started. Some classes will accept more students, others have smaller numbers. Take it as you wish.

3. Most every professor I have had has office hours, and if you can't make those, you can make an appointment with them to talk. Besides that, there are TAs that are always willing to help, and tutoring centers in a lot of the buildings. 

4. It's just like signing up for it again. Try not to fail though, classes are expensive!

And for your other 4.

1. Football games- crazy. Everything going else- no clue. I think it depends on the events, but it would be safe to say there is a decent student turn out for pretty much have everything.

2. How naturally inclined are you to make friends? People here are friendly, if you put forth the effort!

3. Honestly, I'm not sure.

4. The housing around here is pretty crazy! You will have to find a spot early on to secure it, and it might cost a pretty penny too. On campus is nice if you are single or in a single family sort of deal, they have housing for all types!

All in all, I love the U. I am more and more amazed every day at just how great this school is. I am a transfer, and I thought college just sucked, and then I transferred here and I could not be happier. You will have a great time if you decide to come here. I promise you that! </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, the teaching is excellent. I feel like I'm getting a stellar education with professors who are really at the forefront of their fields. 

Secondly, the atmosphere is great. Everyone is super friendly, there are tons of clubs and ways to meet new people, and the physical location is awesome too. 

You have great facilities, the University is updating a lot of the older buildings which is really nice, and they have an awesome gym that all students have access to. 

Besides that, Salt Lake is a great place to live. Mormons aren't half as bad as people make them out to be, and generally are pretty friendly. The bar scene down here is pretty impressive too, and so is the eating scene.

Basically, you will find no shortage of awesome things to do here and at the university. </TEXT>

 I feel a depressed and self loathing Kanye, who is jaded by the influence of fame on his personal life, from the relationship with his wife, to the family members he feels obligated to keep on the payroll, even though they dont even see him as their relative, but more as a paycheck.

<TEXT> Velveeta Mac and cheese with homemade 5 bean chili. Tasty, easy to make. You can also do kraft. Whichever you think tastes better. 

Another good one that I make is cheeseburger rice. Brown your hamburger, season it however you want (I use garlic salt, onion powder, black pepper. Season after you have drained the fat.) , don't drain the fat off unless you are using 80/20 beef. Then throw the rice in and season it a little more to make sure it stays flavorful (I usually add a little ketchup and mustard here to give it some zing.). Add water to cook the rice and let it simmer until the rice is done. Add cheese to top it off. I like to add bacon and pickles before I top it with cheese.

I have made curried chicken Ramen as well, that one is pretty easy, but kinda hard to explain because I made the broth from scratch. I can figure it out and send it to you if you would like. 

Biscuits and gravy takes like 20 minutes. Top them with some fried eggs for added protein. 

Jambalaya is actually easy as well. Buy some andoille sausage, cut up some chicken breast, and add some shrimp if you would like as well. Melt butter in a skillet, and add some chopped onions, bell peppers and celery. Cook until they are browned. Add Cajun seasoning, I use tony chacheres. It will look really dark and smell really strong, but it gets watered down. Add shrimp, then chicken, then sausage. Let them all cook, then add the rice and a little bit more  seasoning. Brown the rice for like 1 minute, then add the water needed to cook the rice. Let it simmer until the water is gone. Notes on this, you can add crushed red pepper if you would like spicy, but the heat on this dish is already pretty high.

Fajita skillets are nice. Season your chicken, and let it sit for a few minutes while you prepare the pan. Add oil, then cook bell peppers, onions until they are softish, then add the meat. You will want the meat to be cooked through when you add the rice. Brown the rice with the spices and maybe add a little more oil if the pan seems dry. Add the water to cook the rice and let simmer. Serve over lettuce or by itself.

A brazilian dish I like to make is stroganoff. It is a little different than normal stroganoff and is in almost no way healthy, but it is really good. Add oil to the pan and get some garlic and onions cooking. Cube your chicken or just use canned shredded chicken. Cook it and season with salt and pepper. Add one little can of tomato paste, add a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. Get that all cooking and hot. You can add something to give it some zest like sriracha or Cayenne, but the dish is generally mild. You can add frozen corn if you want.

 Here is where it gets unhealthy and delicious. You will want to add cream until the sauce is thoroughly orange pink. Pinker has more of a cream taste, the more orange is a stronger tomato taste. You will need to salt this to your liking. Then just cook a pot of rice and eat this over it. Generally you will put shoestring potatoes over it, but they are hard to find, so I use ruffles, but the meal is just as good without them.

All of the rice I use is parboiled. It is healthier than white rice, and takes less time to cook than brown rice. If these seem kind of hard to understand, let me know and I can explain a little further. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 1 hour 5 bean chili </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-18 21:18:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is delicious, perfect for the chilly weather just around the corner! This stuff is good by itself, or in anything from chili mac to chili dogs, or as a delicious starter base for some chunky taco soup. All 5 beans are optional, take your pick on what you want.

Start with 5 cans of beans, rinsed (or make your own, that just takes a lot more time)

I usually use Northern Beans, black beans, red beans, kidney beans, and pinto beans, but you could also use black eyed peas, and I'm sure lentils wouldn't be bad either.

Brown 2 pounds of hamburger, variable on the fat content, it doesn't make a difference except in calories. Once the meat is browned, put it all in a crockpot and add the drained and rinsed beans, and 1 can of Rotel tomatoes and chilis.

 Use beef stock for the base, probably about 2 cups, maybe a little more maybe a little less depending on how thick you like it. I always say add a little more because you can fix the thickness a little later. 

Here is where the recipe falls into your hands. I don't measure my seasoning, so I can't tell you how much of anything to put in, but I season like this:

In order from the most used to least

Chili powder- about 1/4 cup, maybe more maybe less.

Garlic salt- this is a driving force in flavor, I want to say 2 tbsp.

Onion powder- 1  1/2 tbsp

Celery salt 1/2 tbsp

Cumin 1/2 tbsp

Cayenne pepper- this is your heat. Add as much or as little as you like.

Chili powder will be the dark color and rich flavor and the garlic gives it great taste, same with the onion powder. Be careful not to use too much cumin, I feel it overpowers the chili really easily. Celery salt is more to provide a small amount of flavor, you should barely notice it.

Once you season it, set it to high and leave it for an hour or a little more, just to get it hot and get the beans to absorb the flavor.

To finish it up, you just need to make sure the thickness is to your liking. If it is too runny for you, add corn starch a tsp at a time and mix until you get that full bodied thickness.

Serve with whatever you want. Jiffy corn bread if you don't have a lot of time!

Just at the last note, there are WAAAAY better ways to make chili. This is just a quick, easy, and flavorful way to make a good dish. If you have the time, make a nice slow cooker chili with lots of beans, different meats, and tons of time. Cheers, and good eating! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I start by farming white camps until im level 3ish. by then i can set up the harvesters which i usually do. After that, i kinda jump around and try to surprise enemies that are in a 1v1 situation with someone in the lanes or try to rescue teammates that may be caught in 2v1 situations, but that usually ends up with me dying as they fall waaaaay back and leave me hanging out to dry. besides that, just running through the jungle and harvesting.

I hate having to play as a tank with Khai because he just isnt durable enough until late game, by which point we are all focused on the last tower/core, but the team has 1 caster and 3 rangers, so im forced to be the primary hitter. Between that and nobody being able to take down a tower by themselves im stretched super thin on the map. </TEXT>

Besides that, playing as iggy and scorch is about the only caster I feel confident enough to solo with. </TEXT>

Not defending BYU at all, because all rape cases should be investigated, but I think one reason they don't is because some girls have hooked up then regretted it and have told their bishops or the honor office they were raped or pressured into having sex instead of facing the consequences when in reality it was a consensual thing.

When this happens, it is understandable why the honor office might have trouble investigating sexual assault cases, but like I said, every one needs to be investigated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can say for sure that in the area of13th and 13th (East and South) there have been 4 or 5 houses on the market for at least 2 or 3 months. Perhaps this isnt reflective of the market in general, but I have observed the same thing in the avenues. I feel like demand has leveled off, but prices keep going up and that is what concerns me. Wages are pretty good here, but for anyone without a college degree you need at least a full time job and a half to pay for rent in most of Salt Lake County. </TEXT>

Between that and the current rent people are asking for in places like west jordan, it seems like the property may be a little over valued. I am worried air will be priced out of my apartment and that I won't be able to afford to live in Utah! </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an American who lived in Brasil, I think you guys are or at least were close. I haven't been in country since 2014, but it didn't seem that bad when I was down there. I never feared for my life or property, I always felt safe, and the economy seemed to be improving. I know that since the price of oil has dropped, the country is scrambling to find a way to make money, and I think that at times all the import taxes kind of cripple the standard of living, but the country has so many economic resources that with the right management it should come right out of its recession.

Granted, electing politicians is the hardest part and the people will vote for who takes care of them, even if they are also stealing. You guys are close though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been asking the same question. Nobody will answer, but speculation gets down voted. 

IMO if we could land biz for a 2-4 year deal or Howard for a 2 then I say go for it. Besides that, I think that Barnes might be a good fit, and that if the Warriors sign KD that we could pick up Draymond for a good price. He might be a bit vocal, but he is a great guy focused on winning, and I think Stotts could curb the attitude. Besides him, I don't see too many players besides our RFAs that we would really want to sign. I feel like we are pushing for that one piece and that we will probably spend big bucks on a center and then pick out the rest of the team from whoever clears room for KD. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-06-27 16:03:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Alright fellas, here it is. I'm a Blazers fan through and through, but Sactown is my hometown team. We need a center. Plumlee just can't perform with these huge centers down low. The kings just took a Greek center, and given that they already have 2 full time centers, it would make sense that they are going to shop someone around. They are also looking at an aging SF in Rudy Gay who i think is actually a free agent this year, and they need to fill that hole. So how about a trade scenario where we send Crabbe and Leonard for this new draftee and a first or second round pick? We get a lot more size in the middle, more potential, and the possibility of a great pickup in next year's draft?

More than anything I just want thoughts on possible trade scenarios with other teams to fill our gaps in the roster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A reason that I understand is that a women's breasts, whether they like it or not, is viewed as a secondary sexual characteristic. Guys like looking at topless women, and that has become such a thing that there is a multi billion dollar business devoted to showing men (and women) the naked breasts of women. Something that I see happening is men becoming aroused and the women making a big deal out of it. It is a big deal. Men shouldn't have erections in public. 

But a law being passed is not going to change hundreds and thousands of years that men and women have been sexualizing that body part. </TEXT>

Perhaps this is a little backwards in thinking, but if you ask someone to erase your server after the FBI is coming for it, you are trying to hide something. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How PMO almost killed my marriage. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-23 21:16:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been married for just under a year, but my addiction spans much farther. I think I started around 12 or 13, and always thought to myself, I can quit when I'm 16. I can quit when I'm 18. I will quit before I get married. 

I went on an LDS mission and lasted a year and a half, followed by another year and a few months.

Being LDS, it is really hard to express yourself sexually before you are married, and I think I was so excited about finally being able to have sex, that I fell back into PMO. I was able to last another 6 months before I got married, I was worthy to be married, but just after this I fell back into it.

I had an idea of what sex with my wife would be like. I was excited to try everything, and for the first week we tried a bunch of stuff and sex was awesome, but something was off. My wife is on a few antidepressants and anxiety medications and those really take a toll on her drive. Like she has no physical desire for sex at all, which was really hard for me as a young Mormon newlywed. In my mind, we should have been having sex at least 3 times a week, but in reality, 1 time a week to once every few weeks was what my wife could commit to. (We never had a conversation about commitment, just an expression.) 

With the raging hormones and sexual frustration, I turned to PMO to curb my appetite. I was lonely, bored, and increasingly saw my wife as a barrier to my happiness. I had and sometimes still have dreams about cheating on her to appease my sexual desires with unhealthy and unrealistic relationships with women I didn't know.

I have gone on and off as personal goal setting to try and get to two weeks and have done so exactly once in 6 months. When I get close, I always feel a deeper love and commitment to my wife, and I can see past my sexual desires for what she truly means to me.

I have told her about it and she was really hurt, but we have been getting closer and stronger as a couple, and I am happy to say we are on the up.

Don't let PMO ruin your love life, take a stand and say no. You will feel better about yourself, you will feel more in touch with your surroundings, and your family relations will strengthen. Be a good husband, father, brother, friend. ( or wife, sister, mother. Women have the same struggles.) 

Take back your life! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The homeless problem is big, I think we could curb it by making some panhandling laws. I have people that attend my church building that opt out of church welfare to beg because it is more profitable to stand on the corner asking for money than to get the necessities and go to a church unemployment center and find a job.

All in all, the homeless problem still exists, and I don't know why we don't do more to curb it. </TEXT>

Every time I go around my family, I get to hear about how Obama is purposefully trying to ruin the nation, how he is secretly a Muslim letting in first Al Queda, now ISIS, and how he is so detached from his job as a president.

We need to realize that the only way things get done in any relationship is through compromise. Picking battles, coming down a little bit off your high horse and making a compromise that is good for everyone, instead of trying to filibuster progress. You would think that the country is run by toddlers instead of adults, and that the media are just spectators that egg on the problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You really think that? He is only doing what Clinton did on '08. Also, it would be one thing if she won fair and square, but they changed the rules of the game and stacked the deck mightily for Clinton. 

I keep an open mind for politics, I don't usually get too deep into this kind of stuff, but as an observer, it is clear Clinton is cheating, and in front the publics face.

More than anything it is just the company creating a hostile environment than the workload.

<TEXT> I'm with you on this. They have probably been planning out this off-season since the all star break. Keep Karl on until the end of the season, get rid of him and find a coach that is coming out of contract or was fired. I'm sure trading Boogie for a few key players was at one point on the table, but then decided he has been a loyal player who has expressed the desire to stay in Sactown.

All it is now is filling in a few pieces on the roster with the new head coach and praying that he tries real hard to get along with Boogie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because it is asking for an estimation.

Let's say you are planning for an event and your boss needs an estimate of people that will attend to be able to buy enough pizza for all attendees. From the last 2 events you have attendance records of 1973 people and 1877 people. Since you want more pizza than guests, you will need to order pizza for about how many people? Without adding and taking the mean, you can round and just say in the ballpark of 2000 people. 

This is what it is trying to teach, that kind of mental math without needing to add the two numbers and dividing by two. This is good for a lot of professions as well as daily life, like only having 20 bucks to spend and keeping track of how much everything costs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is just common core math nowadays. It isn't inherently bad, it is just teaching the kids to do math in a few different ways that we weren't taught as kids, which is why you get these pictures popping up on Facebook with Republicans blasting common core. 

It is hard to do this kind of mental math for people that do not inherently "get" math, which is what these problems are getting at. First teach estimation, then tricks like rounding to deal with numbers that are easier to deal with (i.e. tens, hundreds) and then working from there. This is good for practical math, like setting a budget, shopping without a calculator, and dealing with large sets of numbers. 

A lot of the parents still have trouble with this kind of stuff which is why parents are so upset because they don't understand it, and a lot of the older kids that were pushed into common core have a hard time understanding the concepts behind the math. Meanwhile the younger kids that are learning it are able to grasp these concepts a lot earlier which helps in the long run. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-05-03 21:38:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  I am writing outlines for two campaigns, one in Edge of the Empire, one in Age of Rebellion.

EotE-

Episode 1. Hired by a crime lord to find a crashed ship and bring it back, and can either steal the lucrative freight outright or plan to grab a ship a little later. you will have to deal with local looters and scavengers and possibly the npc part of the crew you came to do the job with.

Episode 2: Depending on which way it goes, you either need to smuggle the cargo to multiple space ports and sell it or take it up with the planetary governer and persuade him to pay you in return for destroying the illicit cargo instead of selling it and creating a problem on his planet. Destroy it, or try to sell it and collect the money from the governer. 

Episode 3: the entire arc ends in a big chase through space and planetary systems, and finally finishes with an attempted evasion using the kessel run.

AoR-

Episode 1: Rebel base on {planet} is being attacked. Launch counteroffensive and fight the imperials off the planet/moon. destroy or loot as much as you want.(I'm trying to keep this morally ambiguous to let the players decide.)

Episode 2: Directly after, sabotage a Tie manufacturing plant on some planet. This is kind of a stealth mission, but you can go in loud as well. Ultimately we will need to steal an imperial transport to escape.

Episode 3: Lastly, using this transport and some stolen storm trooper garb, enter a star destroyer, shut down the shields, and try to blow it up from the inside.

This is my first time playing and i volunteered as GM. Having read through most of the books, these missions don't seem impossible, but i will have to scale the difficulty down on some of this stuff to work with my players. If these sound like they wouldnt work, let me know! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every game, regardless of how much better you are, ends up coming down to the last 2 minutes. Up 18 at the end of the first quarter? Doesn't matter, you will shoot 15% through the second and be downice by 2 at halftime. Build up an incredible lead? Your opponent will suddenly go on an 11-2 run that puts it within reach at the start of the fourth quarter. It doesn't matter how open you are, you will always miss that wide open 3 to go to double digits if you are under 2 minutes. Hell, you could take 10 wide open 3'source and you would still only make 1 or 2.

If my team is dominant, the worst team in the league should not be able to keep up with me, especially without a star player. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the teams are a lot closer than it seems. The double team on Dame shut down the perimeter offense, and DeAndre in the paint shut down the drives in the paint. Blazers did well midrange, Harkless and Henderson played well. If Aminu can shoot from the 3 more consistently or if they can get Crabbe open on the 3 line, the offense opens up and this series goes 7 with a toss up.

If every game goes like last night, it will be a long (albeit short) series. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I have seen, the team just lacks a leader. All the guys on the team are basically the same age, I think the oldest on the roster is like 29 or 30 years old. My point is, they might have a core of decent players, but they don't have someone to lead them.

If I were the Jazz, I would keep Burke, Burks, and Golbert and work on finding a stronger 3 and 4. Heyward is on or off and just isn't clutch. It is embarrassing to watch him play because he can go cold in an instant and play 1/2 of the game that way. 

I can't say what the solution is, but it isn't a rookie, especially not from this draft class. </TEXT>

And worse, when my team is slacking on D, I can have a wide open shot with Lillard on the perimeter, or posted up under the rim with Horford, and I can't make a fucking shot. Goodbye 12 point lead, hello down by 4 is the last 40 seconds because of some bullshit 16 point run. Honestly, the game feels rigged to keep things down to the wire and it pisses me off. I can play a perfect 3 quarters and then suddenly no one on my team can make a shot for a solid 3 minutes and I lose when I was winning the entire fucking game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you love your job and want to keep it, don't say anything. While nothing may occur in the present, your reputation down the line could be damaged if something were to happen between you and the daughter, i.e. break ups, personal info shared with your boss, any sort of unpleasant or awkward experience. Also, could you imagine if this daughter is super vindictive and decided to accuse you of rape or something of that sort if you were to break up? Even without proof, your boss would probably side with her daughter and you would be S.O.L.

While professionally your personal life should not matter, if you happen to have a weird fetish, something else that you would rather keep personal, or even complaints about work that you share with your boss's daughter, the information is liable to get back to your boss, especially if you have a fallout. </TEXT>
