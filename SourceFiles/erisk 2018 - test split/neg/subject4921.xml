<TEXT> Like I said, 'ethically controversial'....I in no way claimed it was either right or wrong. 

FWIW, overall, I believe Hopkins is a great benefit to the city and society, even though it is flawed sometimes.  No institution is perfect, and it isn't always easy to tell what is ethically correct when doing an experiment.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  Hopkins is pretty much the only entity in the city that's actively investing in neighborhoods even though their plans aren't always perfect.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reasons for hate:

--they own HUGE swaths of the city and don't pay tax

--they pay many of their workers low wages

--ethically controversial medical studies involving minorities, people from other poorer countries

--Buying up property and kicking out poorer/long time residents in minority neighborhoods or making it unaffordable for them after they fix up the area.  

Reasons for love:

--provide jobs with reasonably good benefits to a looooooooot of people

--many Nobel Prize winners and laureates.  Some of THE single greatest minds on the planet are housed at Hopkins

--The US wouldn't have won WWII w/o hopkins and APL:  see the proximity fuze

--Fixing up large portions of the city, trying to get their employees to move into Baltimore (who'll end up being decent tax payers)

--Positive community programs, e.g. underprivileged high school kids from Baltimore schools can go to Hopkins (one of the top universities in the world) for completely free

<TEXT> I think the counter argument is that is that using names simply 'sticks'.  Med school students use the same technique to memorize inordinate amount of information using names, poems, or word play that have 0 related to the science involved.  Some chemical transformations have multiple steps, so I'm not sure what exactly you'd descriptively call those transformations in a concise manner.  Some palladium, ruthenium, etc. catalyzed reactions have extremely complex catalysts or mechanisms, so how do you descriptively name them using less than 200 letters? Everyone doing organic knows, however, what exactly you mean when you say ' Hoffman rearrangement' for example. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A move towards using 'unnamed' reactions in chemistry? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-06 11:22:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So while at the NIH this discussion came up with a very, very high level and famous scientist there who talked about how at one university they've come up with idea that reactions in chemistry will no longer be taught according to the names of the scientists who discovered it.  For example, no names will be used to describe reactions like 'Diels-Alder', 'Suzuki couplings', 'Sonagashira', etc.  They'll instead be called  things along the lines of 'electrophilic addition to xyz...' etc. etc. The reason being that all of the reactions learned in organic 101 are named after men and that they didn't want to discourage women in science.  Someone eventually quipped, 'but what are we supposed to call Michaelis-Menten kinetics then?'

How do the labrats feel about this one?  Just curious.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I try to avoid the areas where they're most likely going to be, although it doesn't always work because sometimes they surprisingly pop up in new locations.  I almost never drive down President Street if I don't have to. 

I've had them hit my car multiple times and cuss me out for being a 'mother fucking faggot' because my automatic windshield wipers came on once they started spraying, which they did NOT take kindly to, assuming I was the one doing it on purpose to shoo them away.  

This was during the summer. My windows were completely rolled up.  My only interaction with them was waving no incessantly (without ANY verbal contact at all).

 I'm not sure how I see that I was in anyway disrespectful at all or wasn't 'treating them like a human being' or was being a thinly veiled racist by simply waving no.  In what society do you live in where older people have to walk on eggshells about trying not to be 'disrespectful' to youth like teenagers?  There are window washers at the end of 83.  There are window washers at President/Lombard.  There are window washers at North Ave./Maryland.  There are window washers sometimes on Central/Baltimore.  There over a dozen panhandlers on MLK/Lombard/at the end of 83 and various other parts of downtown.  Am I supposed to give all of these people money?  And when I don't want to that means I'm a racist?  I've lived in this city for years; sometimes I simply get annoyed for being constantly hounded for money and it has nothing to do with being a racist, it is the fact that I'm constantly being nagged nearly 7 days a week nearly all year, every year for money, and when I refuse I get cussed out and get called a 'faggot'.  I'm not even rich, nor do I drive a fancy car.  

 If these kids are so enterprising, give them a space and funds to startup a car wash somewhere near downtown.  Make them learn useful business skills starting a legitimate business.  Hell, there is a completely lack of any car washes close to the center of the city--they'd make a killing doing legitimate work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Didn't you read the link?  The NIH's own investigation shows that the idea that super labs are more productive the more money you dump into them is dubious.  

People in this thread also talk about how a super lab has to blow $60k on an instrument they don't even really want, only because they have a use it or lose situation.  I'd argue $60k would be better spent on a small lab that's going to actually investigate a new hypothesis rather than buy a super lab a fancy machine that is just going to collect dust. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About time.  Mid career scientists get screwed hard.  In super labs, students in training can go an entire year without seeing the PI in charge and are governed by a whole bunch of post-docs while the PI is going on tour throughout the world trying to drum up funds for any one of their dozen startup companies or is giving talks in order to maintain being famous and in the spotlight.  


EDIT:  I also found this quite eye opening:  "While implementation of a GSI limit is estimated to affect only about 6 percent of NIH-funded investigators, we expect that, depending on the details of the implementation, it would free up about 1,600 new awards to broaden the pool of investigators conducting NIH research and improve the stability of the enterprise."

Yikes.  

I actually didn't make that move on a whim though, it took me 2 days to think over and make that mistake. The reason why I fell for that mistake was because Judge never hit more than 20 HRs in lower ball and it wasn't clear if he had a starting job at the time; meanwhile pundits were saying DeShields Jr. was a lock for the gig and 50 SBs. 

You have to understand our league though.  LMs constantly try to pull off the [Sweeney plan](http://deadspin.com/5789399/the-epic-story-of-a-new-jersey-prosecutor-who-stole-my-idea-and-made-fantasy-baseball-history) in order to pull off asymmetric wins vs. teams that are better.  I already had tons of power on my team with Trout, Machado, Donaldson, Myers, and HanRam so I decdided to pull the trigger and drop Judge for DeShields Jr. because I didn't want anyone trying to out steal me.  

Yes, a mistake for sure.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Phosphorylation of inositol using a phosphoramidite </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-03 02:53:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I found a beautiful reaction from a 1988 tetrahedron paper where they phosphorylate inositol using a dibenzyl diisopropyl phosphoramidite with tetrazole in DCM.  2 hours later they add mCPBA.  
I tried this and it works like no other.  Before I was trying to copy JOC procedures where they were heating carbohydrates in phosphoric acid.....what a mess that was. 


So how does the phosphoramidite reaction work?   I do a lot of chemistry but don't have a doctorate level understanding, so I don't always understand some synthetic transformations and why they work.  In the end I most care about the biochemistry but it would be nice to know how that amidite reaction works and why it works so beautifully. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heh, glycobiologist here.  

It wasn't until the 80s that we discovered a direct link between cellular consumption of glucose and direct modification of protein physiology.  We now know of direct links between glucose and all sorts of things like regulation of gene expression, epigenetics, and modification of almost every single cell signaling pathway.  Post-translational modification via sugars is sort of like the dark matter that is hiding in the cell and something people still haven't heard of too much.

Does carry and conceal prevent crime on a macro scale?  Debatable.  But does macroscale trend matter to you when you're sitting there with someone pointing a gun in your face?  Why do we put anti-lock braking systems in cars when they have close to 0 net effect on fatal car crashes?

That's because you want at least the safety option of not having your brakes seize up/your car skidding when you need it.

<TEXT> Lying....ok, because it is everyday someone posts on a forum like Reddit with the name Sialic Acid.  

Uncle Tom....OK.  I know reddit skews younger, I think many in their 20s still haven't had a lot of experience doing things like dealing with all of the politics that come while working in places like institutions of higher learning, doing something like pitching a business plan, or pitching your idea for a new project to the board running your discovery program in an industry like biotech.  

You simply never win over people when you try to use blunt force.  I've learned my lesson through many failures.  What scientists are good at--science.  What they're terrible at--politics (whether in academia, industry, or government) and policy making.  If you want to convince people to vote for administrations with strong environmentally focused platforms, who are committed to funding institutions like the NIH, or who'll support things like stem cell research, then you need to convince the public using more finesse than what's going on in DC today.  Example, if scientists are so concerned about this topic, why aren't they going out to Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, etc. and doing simple things like town hall meetings to have friendly Q and A sessions on climate change?  Describe to people in HARD and REAL ECONOMIC terms how climate change will affect their ability to farm corn and earn a living in the future. 


 It's always the economy that will drive the vote.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, a dumbass who has committed over 20 years to science as a professional.  You are literally admitting that this whole charade is political.  That in of itself is anti-science. 

This is nothing more than a liberal march.  I'm a liberal too on many issues, but all this march is doing is alienating the very types of people science should be trying to convince that things like climate change are real.  

Guess what this whole debacle is going to do?  A whole bunch of nothing.  Guess what scientists should really be doing?  Listening to people who don't think climate change is real and trying to explain to them why they may be wrong in a non-condescending manner.  This march won't do anything to accomplish the more IMPORTANT goal of actually trying to influence the vote.  

As I've gotten older I've learned the hard way that getting what you want requires you to have much more tact and finesse rather than doing something like this where you're basically telling half the voters 'You're a stupid anti-science supporter!' or 'You're wrong! I'm right because I'm a scientist!'.    

This whole thing will be viewed as yet again another condescending attack from the liberal elitists who think they're above the blue collar man in middle America.  Call me crazy if I think scientists should use more tact.... </TEXT>

Let's be honest here, this march is filled with people who only want to surround themselves with the same liberal echo chamber that is pervasive in the academic setting.....i.e. this is REALLY a partisan march with an anti-Trump agenda. This is bad for science. 


And before you get upset, I'm no Trump voter at all.  If you want to protest Trump, do it under a different brand. People are completely overreacting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many places let you separate based on aqueous, non-halogenated, and halogenated waste.


Never use any type of plastic for organics. It's actually cringe worthy when I see biologists trying to pipette out reagents and organic solvents using things like serological pipettes.  Not only can you contaminate the bottle of solvents, you can contaminate your biology.  Use glass for anything that's organic unless it is something crazy like HF.  

Use glass pipettes with a bulb to measure out volumes in a 10ml graduated cylinder.  For larger volumes like 10ml, 25ml etc.  if you need to be very accurate, use analytical glassware like a volumetric flask or glass  volumetric pipettes.

In general, even if you don't do chemistry, the rule of thumb is NO when it comes to plastic + any organic solvent.  It would behoove biologists to do that:

You just might have to wait out the shit storm for the kid to get over whatever mental block is causing him to choke.  The higher brass went w/ Treinen for a reason, they probably don't want an egg on their face, at least not yet.  Relievers began Monday this week with a 4.10 ERA, compared to a 3.76 ERA in April of last season. Many of them are potential playoff contenders; the Rangers, Mariners and Cubs have all endured blown saves.  Don't forget, we're talking about people and not just commodities here.  Teams do want their players to develop and will be more patient than fantasy players.

<TEXT> The school system is completely inept.  Didn't they 'lose' something like 1000 computers?   They also have had horrible problems before  of unauthorized staff changing  payroll hours that have cost millions of dollars in 'overtime' to be paid.  The school system accountants are so inept that even the busing companies have been rippinng off the system, as evidenced by the fact that the school system was charged fees based on THE SAME EXACT mileage for several months in a row.....Or something along those lines (iirc).  Wouldn't doubt at all if some admin in the school system have a 'friend' who owns or runs the bus company. There are so many criminal elements in and around the Baltimore City school system that it is basically a mafia of people all with their hands in the taxpayer honeypot.  When everyone in the system steals a little bit here and there it quickly adds up to millions of dollars 'lost' leading to a 'budget crisis'. </TEXT>

What other factors must be looked at to see how one company could differentiate themselves?  Something like access to distribution channels?  Costs of production?  How will one company dominate this sector if all of their treatments look the same? Or will they just equally share it?

They have a Thai Side Car which is delish.  Andy also experiments with using fish sauce, thai chilis, 5 spice (what you use in stuff like pa lo), drinks made with Mehkong etc. for some of his drinks. He also is quite good at making classic cocktails and has been trying to learn a lot about them.   

Mayuree is definitely NOT a lounge/fancy place at all though (just a warning in case that's what you're looking for).     </TEXT>

Our favorite on that list is Mayuree (relative to the price). Andy behind the bar is always whipping up something new and does  cocktails (some with a Thai flair) you won't find anywhere else in Baltimore. And it is never super duper crowded. Highly recommend their 5 spice cocktail which he invented and perfected.  And make sure you pair one of their drinks w/ their taro custard dessert, which is amazing--and it's another thing that you won't find anywhere else in Baltimore and is in fact hard to find just about anywhere else in the west.

<TEXT> It really wasn't THAT simple.  You really need to go back an understand how much warfare during Vietnam was different than WWII.  A lot of times during Vietnam there simply were NO objectives.  Thousands of soldiers would slaughter the enemy on 'search and destroy' missions for the sole purpose of ONLY killing them because our kill ratio was so high.  Once those missions were over, the gains that were made were abandoned and the enemy would simply retake it.  You also need to understand how the tactics of the VC, who would often not wear uniforms, hide weapons caches in villages and setup booby traps in civilian locations.  You couldn't tell who was enemy from civilian.  

The type of combat and stress of not knowing who the enemy was coupled with the fact that you and your friends were dying for basically no discernable reason (i.e. objectives would shift and be lost after being deprioritized) probably made them into psychopaths.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say yes, and that's only because DeShields plays on a better team.  They actually profile similarly. Jankowski has 70/70 speed (faster than DeShields) and was, surprisingly, a 1st round pick too.  The power is non-existent, but his K rate should reduce (he's never had over 20% K rate at any level of baseball except for his brief MLB appearances) meaning an even better AVG/OBP/SB.  But, DeShields simply because a better team and better park.

Financial advisers love to constantly talk about the power of compounded interest and how if you invest now you'll be a 'millionaire' by the time you retire, but rarely if ever do they discuss how their 1% fee or whatever also compounds to add up to a shit ton of money.  The financial industry: YOU give us all of YOUR money and YOU take all of the risk--we make money off of you no matter what.  And we make money off of you in an exponential fashion if you do end up getting lucky and beat the market.

Also, the car insurance here is crazy.  I'd literally be getting a huge raise by just moving out of the city and saving on car insurance after an address change.

<TEXT> No, but it is incredibly rich to hear teachers complaining about lack of pay and/or raises when they get paid just as much as millions of people and get entire summers off as well as all of the days off during school calendar holidays.  They also get extraordinary benefits that are better than millions of people, and it is absolutely rich that people with nowhere near as good benefits and time off have to pay more taxes to pay for everything.

And secondly, it doesn't matter where you go, public employees constantly say that they don't make enough money.  In the city where I'm from, the school system and teachers themselves are one of THE biggest wasters of money and perpetrators of fraud in the entire city.  Then they have the gall to complain about salaries and constantly claim there is a 'funding crisis for schools'.  For example, in one case, only a handful of school personnel in our school district are SUPPOSED to have access payroll hours.  An investigation uncovered numerous unauthorized people changing personnel hours for the payroll that made city taxpayers have to overpay for supposed OT hours to many people, hours that were never worked and cost millions of dollars in fraud.   There are wild stories of teachers during days off bragging while at the strip club about how much OT they're getting for days they didn't even work.  The school system here also 'lost' over 1000 computers for students.  School administrators have also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, 'renovating' their offices to make them nice and cushy.....and all during a supposed 'funding crisis'.  

Teachers just need to realize there are millions of people who get worse or the the same compensation that they do AND who probably work more hours every year.  Don't cry about lack of being paid when people who get paid less and who have far worse benefits from working in the private sector  have to pay higher taxes to cover the cost of what teachers (or any public employee for that matter) are demanding.  If you want salary increases, stop wasting millions of dollars by cutting down on fraud too.  Tons of school districts also wouldn't be in such a financial mess if they weren't hamstrung by things like cushy teacher pensions, which is something millions of people don't get.  They should count their lucky stars that they get a pension.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> And many people who are in salaried positions in the private sector never get a single dime for OT when they have to work 50 or 60 hour weeks.  What's your point?  There are many salaried workers who only earn $50k for regularly working 40+ hour weeks or more, and they have far worse benefits than most teachers do, including crappy health care plans with insane premiums or deductibles, little to no retirement benefits if they're salaried at a small company, and get nowhere near as many guaranteed vacation days.  Who exactly is better off, the salaried worker in Philly who won't get OT for working 50-60 hours weeks (possibly even 6 days per week), or the $50k teacher who might sometimes have to do extra work grading exams after 2 PM or 3 PM, coaches baseball in the evening, and who gets amazing benefits?  

I used to work at a CRO as a contracted employee stuck on a shitty $53k/year salary.  Worked 80 hours per week in order to get projects out in order to meet deadlines under contract.  Often would have to work 6 days per week, even 7 days sometimes.  And I got no OT pay.  

Did he get a pension too?  That's something else almost 0 people get unless they work in the public sector.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not always.  One of the things that makes you uniquely human as opposed to any other organism are the sets of sugars and the sugar code the human body produces.  Bacteria often produce sugar structures that are completely alien looking and it is because they literally are--the sugar structures on bacteria are actually what cause sepsis and why you get sick when you get a bacterial infection. They'll often use sugars that humans are completely incapable of using and you never find many types of rare or weird sugars that bacteria use in a human.  Plants and even eukaryotic cells like yeast still don't produce human forms of sugars many times without significant amounts of genetic engineering required.  That's why sugar biology is so , so friggin' difficult--it's because it is an incredibly daunting task to engineer a yeast or plant cell to produce exact types of sugar structures found on a human.   The pharmaceutical industry has this problem allllllllllllllll the time.  A ton of drugs in the pipeline now are things like antibodies and other secreted proteins, but what was overlooked was the fact that those types of drugs and virtually any other type of protein that is produced is covered in sugar.  Pharma almost never uses plants and bacteria to produce monoclonal therapies etc. for a lot of different drugs, and it is because those types of cells are not able to produce humanized forms of sugars that coat them.  The FDA in fact requires you to be able to keep a narrow window of glyco profiles of your drug and it must be consistent from batch to batch.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, you've really stumbled onto a massive field of research and the short answer is basically 'no'.  

The reason why glycobiology is pretty neat is that there is no known code to manipulate that will allow you to produce a specific type of oliggosaccharide.  This is in stark contrast to DNA, which provide a template for you to easily study and allows you to manipulate the production of proteins.  This does not exist for what is known as the 'sugar code'.  We know nature is not randomly making glycans and oliggosaccharides, but there are very well defined types of them, the problem is that no one to date understands how to manipulate nature in order to make a specific type of glycan.  If you could figure that out you'd be a billionaire.  

Synthetically you could in theory do it both with organic chemistry and enzymes, but that tends to be extraordinarily difficult because that's just the way chemistry of carbohydrates works. Just to synthetically make one type of oliggosaccharide that is contained in breast milk (I looked it up) it would take more than 2 people their entire PhDs to obtain.....and there are literally dozens, if not hundreds of different kinds of olioggos in breast milk . 

I mean making specific types of oliggos has been done before (so I shouldn't really say it can't be done), such as making humanized oliggos on the drug EPO for example, but that was a massive effort of chemical and biomolecular engineering--and that was far less complicated than how many types of oliggos are produced in breast milk apparently.  There are some automated techniques to make some oliggosaccharides, but they tend to be low yielding after a lot of reactions.  

Not being able to synthesize sugar structures is actually a big reason why the glyco realm of biology is extremely difficult and why it is still considered to be like the dark matter of biology.  How can you study something that's so difficult to work with? </TEXT>

Now I'm going to have to research what exactly the structures are of these oliggos that 'people can not digest' but our bugs can.  That would be very intriguing and means that there could be some sort of very special carbohydrate metabolic pathways and glycogenes that are upregulated during lactation and which are found almost nowhere else in the body.

<TEXT> Hey stop shitting on my premeds.  The ones I've taken in over the years have been awesome, although that's probably why they went to places like Stanford, USF, Chicago, U Wash, etc for med school.  

By their senior year I've gotten some premeds to do complicated SILAC mass spec experiments and could even trust them to run the whole lab if I had to go away for a weekend.

If my undergrads take time out of their busy schedule to do research I don't waste their time by making them do dishes or autoclave shit, they aren't learning anything very valuable, they deserve to be treated like a scientist in training, so I make them learn how to passage cells to start and if they can finally take care of a single cell lines for a month without contamination (which we test) then they graduate onto the next level. If they end up sucking I have no problem telling them they've been let go. </TEXT>

It's insane we allow people to come here to live, work, and even drive on our roads who shouldn't even be here.  We paid thousands of dollars in fees and tons of time getting my wife's paper work in order to get her green card.  I'd like a refund if we're just going to allow everyone to stroll in and eventually get citizenship for free.  I'd also like to sue the state and US government for my auto repair bills because they're responsible for not doing anything about getting uninsured drivers who have no lawful citizenship or permanent residence off the road.   </TEXT>

Seriously, do you fucking know how many labs on campus have 20L  containers of 70% Etoh for their culture rooms and have been doing that for the last I dunno, 5 decades?  Our lab got cited for that because it was a 'fire risk' even though the the room next door has 20L drums of hexanes and acetone.  


We just changed our label to 30% water and moved the container to a different spot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, as another poster said, south of the Park below Baltimore St and East of Patterson Park Ave. is better.  I used to live on Baltimore St. and had our house broken into (edit: this was also a home invasion--we were present a first degree crime, not just a typical city life crime).  A neighbor also caught video (he has outdoor security cams) of a swarm of kids (12+ of them) beating a random dude for no reason one night on a side street near Baltimore.  

There has been some pretty violent/fucked up attacks on random pedestrians near the park over the past few years, so be aware that that element doesn't always stay on the border near Baltimore street and every so often does make it down to the southern parts of the park.  Don't listen to sugar coaters, do you your homework and take an objective look at the statistics, starting with a crime heat map for example.   </TEXT>

People constantly complain that their orderup delivery is slow.....well yeah, their small restaurant tends to get slammed on a Friday/Saturday night during prime dining hours so it might take 1-1.5 hours to get your order out, sorry.  Additionally, some people leave idiotic 1 star reviews for things like 'pork' in their dish when the dish they make absolutely has 0 pork in it.  Or they'll complain about 'small portions' even though no dish at the restaurant costs more than $14 and I can count numerous shrimp tails or many large size pieces of beef.  

Anonymous idiots have no dea how much their hate spewing rhetoric hurts people trying to simply make a living.  Make Yelp users start identifying themselves and be responsible for what they say.

<TEXT> Thank you!  Very interesting and useful. 

Our lab uses both natural and unnatural carbohydrates to molecular engineer the surfaces of cancer cells (similar to Bertozzi) followed by glycoproteomics identification.  I simply got bored one day and started playing around with some ideas wrt the physiochemical and pharmacological properties of the molecules we use for that purpose --could we one day design a carbohydrate analog that would actually be used one day in a patient rather than just cells?  My interest was piqued when I simply ran them through the HPLC to look for differences in lipophilicity to start.  

ManNAc and GalNAc expensive?  I mean we always purchase from Carbosynth:

100g is only about $500 http://www.carbosynth.com/carbosynth/website.nsf/(w-productdisplay)/9BCBB2ABD562023380256A6B0035AC96

We also bought kilos of ManNAc from NZP:  https://www.nzp.co.nz/mannac

(not sure how much it cost, but it couldn't have been prohibitively expensive since we literally have giant buckets of it in the cold room).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm working with per- acetylated version of N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylmannosamine, and N-acetyl glucosamine.  When I injected them into the HPLC (RP-C18) you absolutely notice differences in their retention times.  After piquing my interest, I simply decided to test their water solubilities and sometimes noticed differences in solubility between those sugars.  

Is there a particular reason why the physiochemical properties are different between those per acetylated hexosamines?  They all have the same number of acetates that are protecting the hydroxyls, the only difference is basically the way the molecule is arranged in 3-D space.  What would make say GalNAc more 'lipophilic' than GlcNAc or ManNAc?  I tried searching the literature and couldn't really find any meaningful hits explaining the physiochemical differences between various carbohydrates due to changes in the way the -OH groups are oriented on the core carbon ring.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did an intership in pharma and it was AWESOME.  They made me synthesize a series of small molecules for a project that was put on the back burner (but the PI was still interested in it) along with purifying them and characterizing them via NMR, MS, and CHN.  It wasn't for BS either, they tested the analogs in their assays.  They even tested some of the best ones I made in animal models and saw efficacy.  Long story short, there were some successful hits in the series that I made, the company took notice and then opened up a whole discovery program back on the project I started working on. It went from me just working on it to a team of 20 people.  

Oh yeah, they were also paying me $20/hr (back in 2004 this was awesome money) and it ended up hiring for a full time gig. Yup, I did real science and learned way more in industry than I did in the classroom--modern synthesis, large scale synthesis, analytical techniques you'd never be allowed to do at my small uni because you always had to hand the sample off to a tech, learned the basic principles of pharmacology, animal models, hell, even what pharma thinks on a business level and what goals they need to meet on the sales front in order to keep the business afloat.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why exactly are people like Ryan panhandling?  A healthy 23-30 year old shouldn't be homeless if they cared enough.  Take up a labor job doing construction, learn a trade skill that pays a decent middle class income, make deliveries for FEDEX, drive a rig or a bus for the city, or work baggage at an airport.  If you were truly starving like that I feel like you could find at least SOMETHING to keep a roof over your head, even though it might not be the best living space.  Plenty of illegal immigrants for Christ's sake can figure out a way to get a job and keep a roof over their head AND they don't even qualify for a lot of emergency benefits.  

There are lot of pandhandlers that don't have mental illnesses, for example, all of the crust punk types that squat on the streets in Hampden.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Still to this day, this clip has haunted me ever since I've seen it.  How someone as high ranking as General Westmoreland could say something like that is beyond me.  And for even more background, here's an old article:

NONE OF THE many newspaper obituaries about General William Westmoreland exhumed one of the most important things he ever said:

''The Oriental doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner. Life is plentiful. Life is cheap in the Orient."

Westmoreland said that in the Oscar-winning 1974 Vietnam documentary ''Hearts and Minds." The quote so stunned director Peter Davis that he gave Westmoreland a chance to clean it up. In a 1997 guest letter to The Washington Post in response to criticism that he cherry-picked the quote to push his antiwar agenda, Davis said, ''When we filmed the interview, Westmoreland paused after making that statement, yelled 'Cut!' and said he wanted a retake because that wasn't how he meant to express himself.

''In the second take, the general began saying exactly the same thing but we ran out of film. We then gave him a third chance to amend his remarks -- much the way Ted Koppel gave Al Campanis of the Los Angeles Dodgers a chance to change what he was saying about nonwhite baseball players lacking the 'necessities' to be managers -- and Westmoreland repeated the statement about the 'Oriental.' I used the third take, since the statement was most complete."

<TEXT> Since when did America STOP taking in immigrants?  That's what I thought.  It is perfectly legal according to all known international laws to police immigration and citizenship.  We certainly take in immigrants every single day--legal ones.  If quota systems are setup that's too bad, maybe other people in the world, besides those down south, need a fair shake at obtaining US citizenship too.

Germany has very strict immigration policies and it is quite difficult to become a citizen.  

Same for Austria and Switzerland.  The Swiss overwhelmingly voted to prohibit minaret construction on mosques as well; even they are allowed to restrict who comes and goes and what those people can and can not do in their own country.  

Sorry, but there's nothing wrong with enforcing the law.  Every country is allowed to do it.

<TEXT> It is completely illegal though to live in Baltimore without of state tags unless you are a student/military/etc.  There are a lot of cars registered out of state by younger people who drive their 'parent's car' or who continue to register back where they are originally from in order to avoid paying higher rates for insurance. That's completely illegal and is insurance fraud.  They are making everyone else who obeys the law pay more money for their insurance.

No one is saying parking on the street w/ out of state tags is illegal for visitors etc.  Out of staters who routinely park in Baltimore, even if they are students, need to have the red sticker in their window, if they don't they should be towed and fined.  What is being said, though, is that people who are legally defined residents of Baltimore who continue to register their vehicles out of state in order to avoid paying higher insurance should have their cars towed and should be massively fined.   People with out of state tags and even people with MD tags should also have their plates routinely scanned and entered into a database that is crosschecked with their registration and where they pay taxes. If their car routinely appears for weeks parked on Baltimore's streets and they have their car registered to a location out of the city yet they pay city taxes, that means they  are dodging higher insurance rates.  Immediately fine them.  Once people realize that , 'holy shit, Baltimore is getting tough on insurance fraud therefore I have to register my car properly at my address', we can accurately gauge how many cars are truly registered/driven around the city. At that point, each additional car registered over the first registered at the same address should face increasing registration costs in order to deter a single house that is renting out from brining in 4,5,6 cars since there are that many people living in them.    </TEXT>

If they aren't, start fining.  Once you get rid of a large portion of cars committing insurance fraud by being tough on it, increase the price of registration for every car over the first one registered to a certain address.

<TITLE> Selective removal of Phenyls from a diphenyl phosphate in the presence of phenyl groups on main scaffold. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-08 03:56:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not a professional chemist, just a guy who needs to do and does chemistry.  I basically have my main scaffold which contains a phenyl group and which has a primary alcohol.  My main goal is to add a phosphate group to that alcohol.  I've come across established procedures for doing something similar where diphenyl chlorophosphate is used to add the diphenyl phosphate to the alcohol.  

My main conundrum right now is how do I selectively remove the phenyl groups from the phosphate while not disturbing the phenyl elsewhere in my molecule.  Almost all procedures I find use platinum oxide and hydrogen to remove the phenyls from the phosphate.  My only concern is that PtO2 and H2 will reduce the benzene ring that is elsewhere in my molecule.  Will that happen?  Is this solvent dependent?  Any ideas, if so, on how to selectively remove the phenyls from the phosphate while not disturbing my main scaffold which contains a benzene ring (assuming H2 is used)?  Any help is much appreciated, thanks!  </TEXT>

Bladders, skin, stuff like that is easy because you can get away with using only 1 or just a few types of cells that don't need to respond to all sorts of different types of autonomic or somatic responses, hormonal cues, etc.  We are way, way, way far away from ever creating a functional complex organ with a printer.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, there's probably already been hundreds, if not thousands, of reviews already on which miRs are altered in disease.  


You could try searching a bit harder for something even more cutting edge, such as trying to review the 'epitransciptome' regulation of miRs.  DNA isn't just methylated, but we know now that even the transcriptome is as well.  And your review could focus on miRs.  I could see difficulty, however, with the fact that it is still quite new so there may not be a lot to review, but on the flip side it is cutting edge and you'd be one of the first:

<TEXT> Yeah, we tried that initially, but the problem too is that the sialidase doesn't always recognize the sialic acids because we treat cells with unnatural sialic acid precursors.  Like what Carolyn Bertozzi does.  I mean I've done lectin experiments before and got them to inhibit but the data is all over the place for SNA.  

And why are we trying SNA binding to unnatural SAs?  Well there had been published literature that has done the same thing and showed that the SNA lectin at least still bound to cells treated with unnatural precursors. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone work with lectins? These things are a huge PITA. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-05 00:32:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Simply trying to do  binding to the surfaces of cells using FITC conjugated lectins followed by FACS.  I've done this a TON, but all of the sudden am having huge problems.  I know you need to preincubate lectins w/ inhibiting solutions to have a properly controlled experiment, but now every single time my inhibited controls for SNA lectin almost always gives a higher fluorescent signal than the actual sample.  Literally almost every single time (n=20+).  The inhibitory cocktail I'm using is 200mM sialic acid + 200 mM lactose + 20 ug/mL fetuin + 20 ug/mL glycophorin.  

I know lectins have a bad reputation for being extremely difficult to work with, but any ideas as to why almost every single time I'm seeing stronger signal in my inhibited sample vs my real sample would be much appreciated.   </TEXT>

So many companies would be screwed then...or do experts and lawyers within pharma expect that even with ACA repeal the biosimilar mechanism would still exist as is ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's amazing how history constantly repeats itself and how no one ever learns from the mistakes all throughout history.  

The bing cherry was invented by a Chinese immigrant --Ah Bing.  Bing traveled back to China for a visit, but unfortunately due to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, he was prevented from returning to the US.  The Bing cherry is now loved by millions of Americans every year and is nearly a billion dollar crop.  

People like my dad were also banned from immigrating to the US alllllllllllllllllll the way until 1965.  He arrived in the United States with nothing in his pocket except $20.  His first job was a busy boy and dish washer at a local restaurant, and his only means of transportation back then was riding a bike.  He'd often have to ride long distances in the rain or snow.  Needless to say, he eventually went to college, became a nurse, owns a home, and sent his kids to college.  Oh yeah, he also drives a FordF150 and rides his Harley nearly every single day.  In fact, I don't think he's ever bought a car that wasn't an American brand.  

Who's more American, my dad or DT? If it were left up to people like DT, my dad would have never been allowed to immigrate and buy American products.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, trying to respond to multiple inquiries here:

--I've used Corning 10-layer hyperflasks before (so basically a flask w/ 175 cm^2 x 10) for one of the cell lines before and only obtained about 80-100 million cells when it was fully confluent, meaning I'd need multiple flasks 10-layer flasks, and if I have to do that with 7 different cell lines it becomes a nightmare.  

-Some won't grow in suspension and just die while some of the lines I've never worked with before, so I have no idea if they'll be happy in suspension or not.  I'm just going with ATCC guidelines and they all adhere.  

-I have enough space for 7 of those flasks.  I'll just remove all of the shelves in several incubators and put them in there.  

-For one of the lines, a fully confluent 15 cm dish will give ~10-15 million IIRC.  I don't think I can grow 20 dishes for 1 cell line and have to do that 7x.  The problem too is that each cell line uses different media so then I'd have to spend a huge amount of time filling up dishes with different types of media and then trypsinizing all of them.  If  I could just pour an initial stock of cells into a large quantity of media and pour it into a multilayer flask, it'd save an inordinate amount of time.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the longest time until around the turn of the 20th century we used to only think of life and disease in terms of DNA and proteins. Almost all proteins that float around in your body aren't just proteins, they're actually GLYCOproteins, and it was that prefix we ignored for a long time because it was simply 'too hard' to understand the language that nature was talking to us in with sugars.

One of the first hallmarks ever discovered and which almost always accompanies cancer are altered patterns of sugars on the surfaces of cancer cells and secreted proteins. We know that a cell is sick or stressed based on what outside sugar pattern looks like.

PSA is actually a glycoprotein. Although elevated PSA may or may not give an accurate diagnosis, we could potentially vastly improve its accuracy by looking at specific glycoforms of PSA and not just the protein quantity itself. Because sugar patterns are altered in cancer, looking for very specific glycoforms adds another dimension to improve the accuracy of PSA. In fact, the importance of the sugar world to biology and medicine is starting to finally catch on and they're trying hard to improve PSA test accuracy by now including the protein + the sugar:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4893645/

http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr500575r

Finally, MRI, like the article states could be used to diagnose cancer by looking at a tumor's sweet tooth. For example, highly advanced and more experimental methods related to MRI are actually now starting to try to image the sugars themselves on tumors completely label free:

<TEXT> I can't comment on other molecules per se and only carbohydrates because that is my area of expertise, but there is a growing cache of evidence linking diet to disease (OK that by itself isn't surprising) but which we now understand a bit of the mechanism.  Carbohydrates and carbohydrate metabolism are absolutely involved in almost every major disease we know.  For example, under periods of 'diabetic' like conditions or state of 'high' feeding, cells have to get rid of excess glucose, and one example of what they do is alter the structure of their extracellular matrix (basically the stuff that surrounds cells, this is ECM for short).  The ECM consists of huge polymers of sugars known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).  I won't go into all of the details, but we know that types of GAGs are super important for developing things like atherosclerosis.  Under diabetic conditions your cells produce a special type of GAG that retains LDL (the 'bad' fats you always hear about).  Your body tries to clear LDL with immune cells that end up forming what are known as 'foam cells'.  These keep piling up to cause a plaque that gives you a heart attack, but the main important thing to recognize here is that sugars and carbohydrates are extremely important for this mechanism related to heart disease.  

In some other examples, bacteria need to break through the ECM barriers in order to spread to other regions of the body.  Snippets of the ECM can elicit an immune response and cause inflammation--which you know about because you all have gotten fevers before.  Under chronic diabetes and high fed diets, we've seen cells produce the same types of ECMs that can elicit inflammatory responses, meaning there is some plausibility to the idea that consuming a ton of sugar could lead to a chronic inflammatory state through promotion of immune stimulating ECM components (which again, are sugars). 

Inside of the cell is even more interesting.  Although many in the scientific community haven't heard of it, we discovered nearly 30 years ago the phenomena that tons and tons and tons of proteins inside of your cells are actually modified by a special sugar known as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc for short).  When it is on a protein it is called O-GlcNAc.  After a lot of effort, we've finally started to understand a bit what O-GlcNAc is capable of doing, which is everything from regulating how proteins are shaped, regulate how they fold, how they signal, how long their half lives are.....basically O-GlcNAc is involved in every aspect of the  physiology of the entire proteome just like phosphorylation is.  A protein complex called RNA poly II decodes your DNA to read your genes.  Well, RNA poly II doesn't bind to DNA and read it right unless it is covered O-GlcNAc.  In fact, your chromatin is heavily covered in the O-GlcNAc sugar, meaning sugar is all over the place in and around your DNA (we can stain for this and it'll light up like a christmas tree).  We now know that O-GlcNAc is involed in regulating your histone code, modifies virtually every single transcription factor (including for example all of the core Yamanaka factors that regulate pluripotency), it is found on proteins that regulates DNA methylation (epigenetics)...the list goes on forever.  You name a cellular process, O-GlcNAc and sugar is probably involved.  

But what does that have to do w/ diet?  Well, GlcNAc is produced by a branch from glycolysis known as the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).  In otherwords, GlcNAc production is directly tied to glucose metabolism, which is ultimately tied to nutrition.  In periods of high feeding, you might have guessed it right, the HBP will produce an overabundance of of GlcNAc which will go on to alter the patterns in the way your cells O-glcnac modify proteins, which then goes on to change allllll those physiological processes I mentioned earlier.  It is entirely plausible that fasting can lead to increased lifespan, because at least for carbohydrates we know that a molecule like GlcNAc and phenomena like O-glcnac is absolutely involved in aging and stress:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27259471

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18185980

http://www.pnas.org/content/107/16/7413.full.pdf

TL;DR:  At least when it comes to high sugar consumption, there are many plausible mechanisms through which a lower calorie intake diet could promote longevity since we know sugars are involved in everything from heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, to basically regulating everything about how your cells work, including many areas related to aging and stress.   </TEXT>

Having gun pointed at you while simply driving home from work by a kid in the middle of the street and having your house broken into while you are present, even when all of the doors and windows were locked isn't 'typical city life'.

<TEXT> You're in investment........ Monoclonal antibodies are a major, major price of the pie for pharma, worth billions.  Do you know why CHO cells are used to ma ufacture some of the biggest selling drugs currently in the market?  Because they produce humanized forms of sugars I the antibodies!  If you change or remove even one sugar on a biologic like say a monoclonal therapy you can drastically alter the halflife of an a antibody therapy by many hours or even days.  Even its efficacy too.  Think about where all cancer therapies are headed - towards an immune based modality.  Sugars absolutely play a full ndamental role  in regualting the immune system, for instance a new target supposedly worth billions of dollars targets the PD1-PD-L1 interaction.  And guess where PD-L1 is?  In the surface of cells, meaning sugars absolutely regulate its physiology.  In fact, the amount of PDL1 found on cancer is regulated by how sugar coated it is (see my post history for a paper I posted related to this the other day).  Also, here's a blurb (fwiw)about the economic growth that's expected withing the glycomics field:
http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/glycobiology-global-markets-for-diagnostics-and-therapeutics-300336986.html

The more pharma moves towards bilogics the more they'll have to recognize that sugars are crictically important for their proteins to work correctly.  Additionally, now is also to the time to jump aboard any future technology for high throughput glycomics that will potentially be developed. Imagine owning the patent or investing in a company that invented DNA sequencing or PCR.  That kind of break through hasn't happened yet for glycomics, but maybe it will in the future, and such a technology could easily be worth billions.

<TEXT> I don't think so, but I'm also not an evolutionary biologist.  One of the things that makes you absolutely and uniquely human are the types of sugars and sugar patterns that are found on all of your cells.  The sugar patterns and types of monosaccharides found in almost all types of bacteria are completely alien looking.  Humans do not use many of the types of sugars found in bacteria - and that's why the LPS structures on bacteria are what make you sick during an infection.  Bacteria predate multi-cellular organisms by many years and use many completely 'weird and strange' monosaccharides when compared to a human.  Same thing for archaea, fungi, etc.....each different type of organism has uniquely different patterns of sugars  

The types of sugars used and combinations have evolved over time.  For example, one sugar that makes you quite human versus the rest of the mammals is the fact that almost all other mammals besides humans utilize a type of sugar called Neu5Gc.  It is basically a hydroxylated form of a sugar called sialic acid (my user name).  An enzyme called CMAH adds a -OH group to sialic acid to produce Neu5Gc.  Millions of years ago our ancestors developed a mutation in CMAH that made it inactive, and theory goes this was a significant event for developing the human brain.  Long story short, sialic acids sugars are heavily found in the brain and are involved in tons of neurophysiology.  Polymers of sialic acids are found at the ends of neurons where they regulate how neurons remodel themselves -i.e. sialic acids are basically involved in memory, learning, and brain development.  The theory goes that the fact that we lost the ability to produce Neu5Gc meant that our brains started to incorporate only unhydroxylated sialic acids (which again is only a uniquely human trait, even among almost all types of mammals).  This altered the molecular composition of those sialic acid polymers at the ends of neurons, leading to the way our brains have developed to today.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Carbohydrates are now being realized as the '3rd' language of life after proteins and DNA.  In fact, nature couldn't have chosen a better molecule than a carbohydrate to encode information.  The entire set of  sugar biology has been called one of the most complex entities that exist in all of nature.  Consider this:  

DNA only encodes for a sequence of amino acids.  2 amino acids by their very chemistry can only be linked together in 1 way--a peptide bond.  Take two carbohydrates, however, and how many ways can you connect them together?  You'll have 5 choices of -OH groups on one sugar in order to connect it to another sugar.  On top of that, sugars can have alpha vs beta configurations, meaning just two sugars can be connected in about an order of magnitude more complexity when compared to just two amino acids. Move up to 3 different amino acids that are encoded by DNA and you can only get 6 different combinations; 3 different monosaccharides and already you can produce 1,056 to 27,648 unique trisaccharides.  In fact, if you use just 6 sugars you already have over 1,000,000,000,000 different possibilities -  contrast that complexity to the genetic code and amino acids (which might only have about on the order of a few hundred thousand to a million different possible number of combinations).  Often times nature will use combinations of about 6-15  monosaccharides to attach to proteins AND attach these on *multiple* spots on a single protein--thus the number of truly distinct molecular forms of proteins potentially could be mind melting when you consider the number of possible combinations of sugars that can get added to them.  The way these linkages occur absolutely matter for life and I always give my students an easy example that they've already probably learned in high school -- for example, take a polymer of glucose molecules.  If you link them in one fashion you get cellulose--something you can't digest--or put them together another way and you get starch--glucose you CAN digest.  Nature absolutely recognizes and is very sensitive to the different and sometimes subtly different ways sugars are connected on proteins.  These differences can often have major consequences for biology, such as producing cancer that's very aggressive vs. cancers with better overall prognoses.  

The worst part about this fascinating field, however, is that there simply is NO known code that rules how sugars get added to proteins in order to fine tune how life processes function.  I mean we know nature isn't adding sugars to together randomly because we can detect very unique patterns, but to this day no one is able to predict when, where, what type, and why some sugars show up when they do.  Basically what we have here is another hidden layer of massive complexity on top of 'classical' biology (which is ruled by DNA and proteins) that was basically completely ignored by scientists until about the turn of the 20th century.  For the longest time back in the 20th century when people wanted to study a protein they'd chop off all of their sugars in order to make studying it easier. Oppps, turns out those sugars are quite important, and in some examples we have, the sugars are more important than the underlying proteins themselves!   Worse yet, there are other classes of molecules such as LIPIDS that are also coated with sugars that are extremely important in biology and both lipids and sugars are produced by processes which have no known codes like there are for protein.   Essentially what you have here is a revolution in biology that's akin to the quantum world that revolutionized physics.  DNA and protein would be like classical physics while sugar biology and understanding how it regulates like would be like quantum physics because of its non-template driven nature. Our tools for studying the 'sugar code' are still completely terrible and crude, we simply do not have the techniques available yet like we do for DNA where we can sequence the entire genetic code.  Doing sugar biology and trying to crack the sugar code is like doing deep space exploration in biology.

<TEXT> Mixed feelings on this one.  One of the biggest reasons for transferring those programs is actually to get MORE white kids at those primarily black schools.  If they could guarantee that the quality and degree would be the same, then what's the big deal, espcially if those programs really were started at UMBC, UMD, .etc. under dubious circumstances.  Graduating with a degree in electrical engineering creates more wealthy graduates who go on to get better jobs who'll subsequently donate more money to what was previously an underfunded university that was primarily black.

<TEXT> We like Mayuree Thai Tavern a lot.  Their pad thai and noodle dishes are superb.  Also try their taro custard dessert.  It is awesome and absolutely like what they have over in Thailand. Also gotta recommend their massaman, it's the best I have had anywhere around here. Been to Thailand more than 9 times in my life and we like Mayuree.  There's a new place in Mount Vernon too--Khun Nine Thai.  It is pretty good, they have Northern Thai style sausages and the famed khao soi which are two things that aren't always the easiest thing to find in the US.   </TEXT>

Yeah, Baltimore doesn't have good Chinese food overall (which is kind of surprising), it's all in Rockville and not even in DC.  A J in Rockville has awesome food - including their XLB.  

XLB is the type of thing that people are nazis about though, but whatever, I thought the ones at A and J were really good.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> South Dakota.  

Basically the 1978 ruling allowed banks to export the laws of where they were headquartered across state lines.  If you lived in CA and CA had usury laws putting a max on the amount of APR that could be charged for a credit card at 8% then all the banks had to do now was move to South Dakota, where thanks to Bill Janklow, were literally allowed to write usury laws themselves--then they could sell the credit cards to people in CA with APRs of 20% because SD's rules apply only according to the Supreme Court.  Ever wonder why credit cards are allowed to have insane APRs like 20-25%?  It's because Delaware and South Dakota got smart---they realized that after the ruling if they basically made the worst laws possible for consumers that they'd attract enormous interests in companies relocating to their states, bringing billions of tax dollars.  And that's the reason why many credit cards have high interest rates today--because of Delaware and South Dakota (and sometimes Nevada now).  The vast majority of credit card banks are located in Delaware and SD and everyone has credit cards with rules that their own states don't make, the rules for their credit cards come from DE and SD--states where the banks themselves wrote the rules.  Usury has been regulated literally since the dawn of Western Civilization, yet after the 1978 ruling we allowed the lenders themselves to write the rules of lending.  


Mortgage banks also wised up and followed suit.  They simply fled to the state with the worst consumer protection laws for writing mortgages and guess what happened?  The entire subprime mortgage crisis in 2008.  

And what does Congress want to do now?  They want to 'open up cross state competition' for the insurance industry and get rid of regulations after killing Obamacare.  And guess what'll happen? The same crap that happened with credit cards and subprime mortgages--states will definitely compete--they'll just have a race to the bottom of the barrel in order to make the worst laws possible for health insurance so that insurance companies will relocate to their states.  Then they'll be able to sell their crappy plans to everyone in the country because one or two ahole states decided to make terrible laws (probably due to kickbacks and bribes).  

And that's why National Bank v. First Omaha Corp was one of the most important rulings of the entire 20th century.   </TEXT>

But besides that, yes, it is extremely hazardous to ride bikes elsewhere in the city.  Baltimore drivers are some of the worst in the entire country, not just because they're bad at driving, but because they're extremely aggressive.  They have no problems at all running bikers off the road or tailgating them.  Also, you need to plan out a safe route for where ever you go.  I know way too many people who have been approached or have gotten jumped for their bikes by kids.

<TEXT> Politics 101.  You ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS purposely underestimate the true cost of a project.  The biggest hurdle is just getting the things started.  Once you've started it and committed large portions of public money towards a project almost no politician wants to be left with an incomplete project that was never finished because that would 'waste tax payer dollars'.  At that point it is almost always easier then to get the additional money needed once a project has started even though you knew in reality that the original cost was much higher.  

It isn't always a bad strategy either--it is quite effective and actually gets things done.  Some great infrastructure projects that millions of Americans have benefited from for decades would have never gotten accomplished if the projects kept getting delayed for years and years due to bickering over costs.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> And no one wants to be a BPD cop because of the outrageous level of violent crime and hardened criminals that they have to constantly deal with.  No one is putting all of the blame on the cops alone here.  All of the problems stem from poverty and economics.  There'd be far less violent crime, kids growing up in crime, and mass incarcerations if people didn't live in poverty.  

The government should be doing much more to combat poverty in Baltimore, but our city's leaders piss away millions of dollars on things like consultants, spending their money on parties for themselves and their friends, overpaying corrupt school administrators who constantly change their work hours so that we have to pay millions of dollars in OT pay for hours not even worked, losing 1400 computers for our city's kids....the list goes on. 

If you want more money to fight poverty which fights crime, start following the money.  It's almost always about the money.  Yet Baltimoreans have constantly elected the same official(s) over and over again who've done an atrocious job of being stewards over our city's finances.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a left center voting Democrat.  Voted Dem for years on the national scale: Kerry, Obama 2x, and Hillary (ugh).   Voting in different types of people (such as independents for example) might actually do this city some good.  Not sure why you are going off on this tirade.  Dem, Repub, or whatever....it doesn't matter.  By voting in the 'the same politicians over and over again'  I didn't in anyway exclusively blame Dems only.  By 'the same' politicians over and over again, what I mean are the same corrupt bureaucrats that have their hands in the money jar that are getting paid 6 figure salaries to not do their jobs or fail at doing it as well as getting six figure salaries for their friends.  

A ton of posters on this sub think Baltimore the the greatest city in the world.  That slogan is on our city's benches.  Well, OK, if that's true, then why do we consistently accept a completely inept city government, that for years, continues to do the same things over and over and over again with play to pay schemes, shafting residents with programs, overpaying for marginal police results...it never ends and yet all the city government ever does is continue to ask for and demand more money.  No. How about some accountability first.  Maybe residents should start demanding tangible results, such as say a reduction in murder rates to start.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It has a lot to do with Baltimore's epic rate of violence.  When you elect officials that demand 0 accountability you get this.  We had a thread a while back where I outlined many examples of how Baltimore's corruption is out of control.  Baltimore spends something absurd like 20 %  of its entire budget on police (for many other US cities it is more like 5-10%).  You'd think that for that kind of money BPD homicide could clear more than 40% of cases.  1 out of 3 cops last year applied for comp due to 'injuries received on the job'-- which in fact may be possible, but it does raise eyebrows.  Police and fire also have the city on the hook for $765,000,000 in owed retirement money.  For allllllll of that money, where is the accountability?  Accountability starts with finances.  And Baltimore keeps electing the same officials over and over and over again that don't care about accountability.  

Cops not doing their job, millions in aid money being held back by the housing authority and not being spent to fight poverty, millions of dollars that could be used in other ways to fight poverty being wasted on spending nearly 20x more than is allowed by the city's own rules on consultant fees by the city government.....that is exactly how voting the same way over and over leads to a mess like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone who still goes to church is a hypocrite. Period.  How could one possibly still support such a corrupt and evil organization like the Catholic Church?  Even after the whole pedophile scandal?  You can bet your ass the Church and probably even the bishop of that diocese knew what was exactly going on at that location.  I mean who didn't see anything suspicious about sneaking in a gaggle of women for years in a church?  

I had an uncle involved in the whole child sex abuse thing and he got a huge payout along with a lot of other men who were abused by several priests during the 50s and 60s.  The stories and details that came out during the trial, and which are almost never covered by mainstream media, are absolutely shocking and disturbing beyond belief.  For example, most people know that the Church did indeed know about their pedo priest problem and some people even know that pedophile priests were shunted all across the country and world in order to cover up their crimes and keep things secret, but what many people don't know are the great and extraordinary lengths almost all of the local churches and dioceses went through before the trials began in order to hide their money so that they could appear to the courts as being less wealth than they appeared on paper in order to help reduce their payouts to victims.  The Church, being the world organization that it is, shifted and pulled out money and moved them to hundreds (if not thousands of accounts) all over the world in foreign countries in order to make it impossible to track the money down and evaluate network by prosecutors in order to help determine a number for payout.  If covering up pedo priests, doing nothing about it, AND trying to hide your money in order to avoid properly compensating victims isn't evil, well I don't know what else to tell you.  No one who is remotely faithful to Christ should even be stepping foot in a Catholic church.  

Other disturbing details emerged from the case such as one priest who routinely abused boys almost every week would also have over women to sleep with for years.  Another guy involved in the class action lawsuit suffered abuse so unspeakable I can't even type it here; he ended up getting a payout 10x what my uncle got, but which was probably 1 billion fold under what needed to pay for him for what happened to him as a child.  If the devil himself made an organization on Earth, it would be the Catholic Church.   </TEXT>

He served his time in the Marine corps  for 10 years and 2 tours in Iraq which allowed him and gave him the means  to pursue his master's degree. After retiring from the Marines he pulled in $130,000 last year as a UAV operator for a private firm and owns a 5 bedroom house, no student loan debt, and a BMW.

Unfortunately there just isn't a whole lot 'in Baltimore' that is close to Woodlawn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So in otherwords the profit margins are insanely thin.  I once remember a consultant who gave our class a presentation on what he did for a living and once talked about how to increase profits for a specific chain of McD's. One of the things they needed to work on was cutting down on 'losses', where employees wouldn't think too much about giving away a free hamburger or two to their friends and family who showed up.  In order to recoup the profit loss from one free hamburger given out by an employee the store had to sell 30+ burgers.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean I don't do anything special except read the news.  The facts above are all headlines you can read about in the news.  The folks over at Baltimore Brew do an excellent job at doing their best to fight for Baltimore city government transparency when it comes to spending.  They're one of the biggest reasons why SRB was prevented from overspending tax payer dollars by $100 million dollars to install water meters through a company that was connected politically to her administration.  Honesty, I don't know what else to do except be a pain in the ass to your representatives.  The voters of this city will always continue to vote for the same.  Your representatives are a cog in the corruption machine.  Nothing will get done.  The scariest part is that  the facts above are only what has been caught in the news, god knows what else *hasn't been found yet* in terms of cronyism, wasteful spending, and kickbacks.  I'm surprised the FBI doesn't have a permanent office in Baltimore in order to be a permanent hemorrhoid in the ass of Baltimore's City government.  They could probably catch a case of corruption which has led to tax payer dollar waste almost every week.   </TEXT>

Things clear up even more dramatically around Remington and the border of CV for parking once all the college kids leave too.  I do, however, expect it to get worse over the next decade. Remington is building up fast because there's no more space in Hampden.  It is basically becoming Hampden 2.0.  On the flip side, now is the time you can probably make a lot of money buying up property in Remington before it gets more expensive in the coming years.  As for RPP, I don't even buy it because I leave for work early enough everyday that I don't need it and come home late enough that I don't need it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a lot of corruption in Baltimore.  No one really knows where all of the money is going because the city comptroller, who has been in office for decades, does a terrible job.  No one paid attention to that race this past election and we continued more of the same.  There's a huuuuuge portion of the city's finances that gets sucked down a big black abyss. I forget the statistic, but Baltimore spends something insane, like 20% of the city's entire budget on the police alone.  

This is a city where

--DPW employees took bribes for dumping, costing the city over $6 million in revenue 


--Injury claims by city workers cost over $39 million last year.  1 out of 3 cops filed claims for work related injuries.

--City schools used $15 million in federal funds for things like dinner cruises, PTA meals, and a mother/daughter makeover.

--The Baltimore City School's information chief authorized $250,000 worth of renovations for his department, including his executive suite. And all while the city keeps demanding hundreds of millions more for education.

--The Rawlings-Blake administration had the City Hall phone system fiasco that wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars due to conflicts of interest

--The entire Schaefer administration during the 70s and 80s was corrupt. Examples include spending $4 million in taxpayer dollars to fix up a hotel owned by a friend of the mayor, which ended up wasted since the hotel soon went bankrupt.  In another instance, the Schaefer administration spent $5.6 million fixing up an apartment complex owned by a Schaefer political supporter.  

-- We had yet another horribly corrupt mayor with Schmoke after Schaefer. Schmoke wasted nearly $100 million in federal funds trying to build an 'Empowerment Zone' which failed miserably to generate any job growth.  The Schmoke administration also blew $25 million in HUD funds on rampant cronyism, no-bid contracts, and massive cost overruns.  

--We spent $2.8 million in overtime pay for school employees in 2010, even though it is highly doubtful the employees worked those hours.  The school system failed to collect $1.5 million in debts and also had oversight so inadequate that the school system has paid millions in contract work that wasn't verified, lost 1400 computers, and allowed a shit ton of employees to adjust payroll hours even though those permissions were not required for their jobs.

--105 school system employees had home addresses that matched the addresses of vendors hired for instruction, special education and consulting services. A review of eight procurement payments showed that seven went to vendors who were also system employees.

--The school system continued to pay for special education until 2010, even though those contracts were up in 2008 and even though the contract was never renewed by the school board.  This cost $6.9 million.

--We paid school bus contractors after being invoiced for nearly $350,000 even though the vendors listed the same exact hours and mileage for nearly 50 buses every month.  

--Consultants were paid $27 million to help manage the city's sewer repair projects.  This happened even though the fees paid to consultants exceeded the city's limit for fees by 18x.  

-Pension liabilities for retired police and firefighters have ballooned up to $765,000,000 

-Former mayor Dixon's  campaign chairman, Dale G. Clark, failed to file state income tax returns after earning $500,000 as the City Council's computer consultant. He did that job for six years without a contract.



And these examples are only a tip of the iceberg of the corruption, cronyism, and pay-to-play schemes that have plagued Baltimore for decades.  Have you ever heard of death by a thousand cuts?  Because that would be Baltimore.  Every fucking person in the city government and friends of people who are in the city government has their hands in the honeypot.  No one is held accountable.  Fraud is rampant.  Kickbacks are rampant.  Corruption is out of control.  I mean I almost never, ever vote Republican, but goddamn, unfettered Democrat control of Baltimore for the last 60 years has produced the results you have today.  It might actually do some good for the city if other parties were elected to help run it.  Where do your taxes go?  Into the corrupt hellhole abyss known as the Baltimore City government.  I can't wait until 2020 when we get to hear about the stories of the rampant corruption, bribes, and contract over-payments totaling millions, if not hundreds of millions, for the massive Port Covington project.  Even as a left leaning and voting Democrat, I am almost always in the camp to say NO to demands for increased taxes whenever the Baltimore City government asks.

<TEXT> Sugars go beyond the 'classical sense' and what most people think of as 'sugar'.  Everything, and I do mean everything, contains sugars and carbohydrates--meat, plants, etc--they all have sugars.   When most people think of 'sugar' they think about fructose, sucrose, or sugars used to sweeten things.  The basic thing to understand about glycobiology, however, would be to understand the major types of monosaccharides which run life, they are:

Glucose:  http://stopdiabetesmellitus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Glucose.png

Galactose: https://www.smartkitchen.com/assets/images/resources/large/1362523042galactose.jpg

Mannose:  http://oregonstate.edu/dept/biochem/hhmi/hhmiclasses/bb450/winter2002/MN/MANNOSE.GIF

Fucose: http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/structure0/083/mfcd00135603.eps/_jcr_content/renditions/mfcd00135603-medium.png

N-Acetyl Glucosamine: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/N-Acetylglucosamine.svg/620px-N-Acetylglucosamine.svg.png

N-Acetyl Galactosamine: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Acetylgalactosamine.svg/300px-Acetylgalactosamine.svg.png

Sialic Acid: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Sialic_acids_2.png/360px-Sialic_acids_2.png

These are the major  monosaccharides that make up virtually everything related to glycobiology in a mammalian cell.  There are a few other rarer types of monosaccharides and different forms of these sugars (e.g. 5 membered rings vs. 6 membered) which life uses, but there's no need to discuss them here.  


When I say 'chromatin is covered in sugar', what I really am giving is the extremely watered down idea that chromatin is covered in the sugar N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).  Long story short, glucose gets converted into GlcNAc through a pathway known as the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).  Fructose-6-phosphate (a major intermediate of glycoslysis) gets shunted down the HBP to make GlcNAc.  GlcNAc then gets added to TONS and TONS and TONS of proteins inside of your cells to regulate their physiology.  This concept is known as 'O-GlcNAc'.  So when I say 'Chromatin are covered in sugar', what I'm referrring to are the O-GlcNAcs on all of the proteins that comprise your chromatin.  For example, nearly every transcription factor (proteins that assist in genes being decoded) are regulated by O-GlcNAc.  Histones, which are the protein balls that your DNA wraps around to be packaged, are covered in GlcNAc.  The ability of your DNA to unwind from histones in order for genes to be read is regulated in part by the GlcNAcs that are added to the histones.  But the major point is that nutrition is linked to how much 'stuff goes through the HBP' which regulates how many GlcNAcs are made which regulates how they're added to allllllllllll of the proteins inside of your cells which regulates how your cells function.  

This book chapter is free on the topic of O-GlcNAc:

<TEXT> Glycobiologist here.  

Yes, there is a TON of stuff we don't know yet about the role of carbohydrates in biology and health.  Next to DNA and protein, the language of carbohydrates has been called 'the third language of life'.  At least on the cellular level, we absolutely know that adding 'more sugar' to cells alters their physiology--sugar patterns will change on the surface of cells and intracellulary more sugar gets added to proteins.  These effect descend from pathways other than glycolysis and OXPHOS.   

Your chromatin (basically the entire complex of your DNA) is absolutely covered in a TON of sugar.  Nutrition and sugars absolutely affect how genes are transcribed.  The main protein machine,  called RNA poly II, won't bind and read genes right unless it is covered in sugar.  Nearly every aspect that regulates your epigenetics is also heavily regulated by sugars that get added to all of the proteins that perform or reverse epigenetic mechanisms.  That would be entirely consistent too with the phenomena that was observed during the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1945 and the vicious cycle of type-2 diabetes perpetuated in the offspring of affected individuals </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that a shitload of Delwareans aren't even aware of how their own state government works. Out of the entire country, DE is probably the least democratic and has the most Draconian laws on the books for ballot measures.  You people do know that DE is the only state in the entire country where you can not vote on initiatives and referenduns and that DE can change its constitution without a popular vote. Why is it so hard to legalize marijuana in DE?  Well for one, the people aren't allowed to vote on it and it requires going through a government beaurocracy in the State House that can be corrupted by special interests with lobbying money. The only thing DE residents were able to vote on for the entire 80 years from 1908 to 1987 was whether or not charities are allowed to have gambling events in order to raise money.  Raise cain for a bigger issue than marijuana--and that's moving to get rid of the laws that make it impossible to vote on I and Rs.  Get that done and the other small dominoes, like wees legalization, fall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I contacted his sister and she said that they are aware that he's been 'acting OCD' , but he comes from the type of family that is a bit 'hippyish' for lack of a better word and I bet that they'd believe some of his story.  The only thing that makes it difficult is that my friend is actually a dual citizen.  Right now he lives in Europe completely away from his family in America. He has some Swedish family, but other than that he is on his own. He's literally free to roam around the world unsupervised.  I contacted the embassy of the country he is from to let them k ow what's up.  His parents have tried to convince him to come home but they say that he is stubborn and won't listen to them (yeah of course he is).  I know he will live in denial, and his immediate family seems to be oblivious to the fact that nothing short of getting on a plane themselves and dragging his ass home to America will get him the real help he needs . </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long story ahead warning. I was supposed to meet my friend who I haven't seen for a long time in a foreign country while on a vacation.  My friend made it to the country but never showed up to the place he was supposed to come to on the date he said he would. I was eventually able to contact him while in the foreign country and he began to tell a quite peculiar story.  First, upon his arrival, he went to a different city for a 2 days.  He said that he initially got into an argument with a local taxi driver over a fare because of a simple language misunderstanding.  The next day he said he skipped out on a taxi fare because he 'was tired'.  It was because of these two incidents that he claims the residents of the city became angry at him and started to take his photos everywhere he went.  According to him, residents in that city had a 'secret group' on a messaging app for smart phones where they were all taking photos of him, plastering it on the group, and 'talking shit' about him.  The people of the city were also becoming openly hostile towards him.   He said that he felt threatened so ended up leaving that city for the country's main capital.  There he said that nearly 80% of the people in the city were still able to recognize him and were 'talking shit' in a mockingly/threatning way.  Mind you, we are talking about a massive megacity with over 10 million people, so I find it hard to believe that so many people were able to 'recognize him'.  He claimed that the group messaging app on the phone from the previous city was able to follow him and post messages to people who were part of the group chat for the new city he traveled to. But his story gets more peculiar. 

He says that his conundrum actually began way back at home in Europe.  Back home he said that he had been living with a 'mold problem' for several years and became 'infected' with a nearly impossible to cure fungal infection of many multiple subtypes of fungi.  He even had a name for his ailment--CIRS--chronic inflammatory respiratory syndrome, a conditions which he said causes him overall lower quality healthy and all sorts of problems ranging from heart palpitations and immune system problems to just being generally sick all of the time.  Part of the reason he agreed to travel to the country we were supposed to meet in was because he wanted to 'decontaminate' from his fungal infection, and the weather where we traveled to would be good for that. I was eventually able to track him down in the main capital city and was finally able to meet him.  After flushing out more details, I listen to him talk about how he had to throw out all of his clothes upon arriving in our destination country because 'they were contaminated'.  Right now he basically is walking around a foreign country with nothing but the shirt on his back and no luggage.  The only other thing he has is a backpack.  I also noticed that he was not wearing any shoes and asked him about it.  He said that he could not wear shoes because they are closed and that that makes it easier for fungi to grow inside of it.  He therefore wears sandals that he can easily throw away.  He also has been keeping his money, credit cards, etc. in plastic bags so that he 'doesn't contaminate them'.  In another peculiar set of events he described, he said that 'secret police' were following him because of the fact that he bought 'organic fertilizer/cleaner' or something.  I asked him what that was for and he said it was to 'clean my credit card that got contaminated'.  I asked him for more details about how he knew the secret police were following him and he talked about how he was visiting a local park and while going to the bathroom 'saw two shady looking men' enter the bathroom and go into the stalls next to him.  They also apparently had walkie-talkies and were saying things (but he couldn't understand because it was a foreign language).  Later on he also said that those secret police actually met up with American spies in that country who were also keeping dibs on him to see what he was up to, so right now he claims that basically the entire populace of the country is harassing him via  a messaging app, that he is being followed by secret police, and that even the American government is spying on him.  He also says that people everywhere are saying the same shit talk phrases over and over to him.  We made it out to dinner together after meeting and I asked him if his condition affected his diet at all.  He said it definitely did and that he now has to avoid gluten, wheat, sugar, processed foods, etc.--basically anything that won't help fungi to grow.  I asked him if he still drank alcohol and he said that he definitely avoids beer because it uses yeast, but that he will still partake in whiskey and 'dry red whine'.  Puzzled about the fact that he said that he could still drink red wine but not beer, even though wine still requires yeast, I asked about it and he basically had nothing but hand waiving explanations (basically he forgot or didn't know that wine still requires yeast and yet was still fine drinking it--for me this raises a huge red flag that everything with him is completely psychological).  Further in our discussion over dinner, he said that people everywhere were secretly trying to take his photo and record audio of him and what he spoke.  He said that people everywhere who he never met before nor ever interacted with would repeat to him what he said in English during other previous instances, but are clearly doing it in a mockingly way.  Additionally, I come to find out that my friend had also 'lost his passport' according to him, but I could tell that he was probably lying and didn't want to say that he basically threw it away because 'it was contaminated'.  I eventually was able to contact his sister through facebook and she told me that he definitely destroyed his passport and cut it up.  In yet another hard to believe claim, he also said that while he was sight seeing in the city, a soldier who was guarding a government building was secretly and mockingly trying to point his rifle at my friend while he was walking by.  My friend said he 'pretended not to see the soldier doing it', but swore he knew that the soldier was pointing his weapon at my friend.  

 I'm worried that my friend will eventually encounter some physical harm because he says that he keeps yelling at local people who 'are taking his photo and recording him'.  I'm afraid that they won't understand that he might be mentally ill and will think he is either high on drugs or is drunk and physically harm him as a result.  If that doesn't happen, I'm also afraid he might also get into trouble with law enforcement in a foreign country who won't be able to understand what he's saying due to a language barrier.  Additionally, I don't know if he will ever leave the country because he might think that 'there are spies' at the embassy he needs to go to in order to replace his passport that he destroyed.  I met my friend over dinner and he seemed functional and can speak coherently and write coherent emails.  His feet and hands were dirty, but the rest of his appearance was clean and OK.  He also ate food without problems, but his stories make no sense at all and reek of paranoia.  He's constantly afraid of being followed and is being 'harassed' by just about everyone.  He also said that he suffered from chronic lyme disease--yet another controversial syndrome that isn't recognized by established medical science after through review and study.  Any thoughts?   Is my friend slipping into psychosis and becoming schizophrenic?  Is it just extreme OCD? A combo of both?  My friend is also planning on 'leaving the country and going to Spain to detox' because of all of his 'problems' that he's encountered in the country he's currently in.  My other worry is that he'll be traveling all over the globe to reach his goal of 'detoxing' and his family may never hear from him again.

<TEXT> I wouldn't yell at you.  The problem is that biologists don't ask questions in the first place because they have no idea that they're doing something wrong.  If you came to me asking why you extraction were low, I'd gladly explain that if you extract a molecule with acidic groups using slightly basic aqeous solutions and an orgainc layer, you might be losing a lot of it in the aqeous because you made a salt which is water soluble.  The problem is getting biologists to recognize something like adjusting pH with HCl for a buffer that shouldn't contain Cl ions is wrong in the first place.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's obvious. Like I said, I see the worst of both worlds.  A lot.  Chemists that don't know fuck about doing cell culture and contaminate everything when they try to do everything themselves and test their molecules they made.  

If you're building a multimillion dollar pharmaceutical company and your biologists fuck up an inhibition assay because they didn't give 2 craps that the target they're working with has allosteric sites for chloride ions and they wrongly used HCl to adjust a buffer that's used in the screening assays, well then, you could advance a molecule on a  complete set of wrongly acquired data and waste millions of dollars.  And who'd be more at fault here, the chemists making the molecules for screening or the biologists making the buffers for their assays? There's no excuse for not caring or not knowing basic chemistry principles as a biologist/molecular biologist, as condescending as that sounds.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, I apologize. My initial intent was not to sound like a douchebag and I can see now how my comment could be construed as such. But it was intended to at least instill a little bit of panic for anyone doing something like adjusting a TRIS buffer with something like NaOH.  The hope is that they'd go and look up acid base chemistry, relearn the concept of a Lewis acid, learn themselves how to properly adjust pH for buffers, relearn the concepts of ionic strength and it's biological importance, relearn which chemical groups are acids and bases etc.  If I simply gave the answers I feel like labrats wouldn't learn as much if they corrected themselves. So much of life, biology, and molecular biology is extremely sensitive to basic chemical principles and it is quite disconcerting the woeful lack of attention to basic chemistry I've seen in the lab constantly by people working in the biomedical sciences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not to sound judgemental or elitist or anything, but some of the basic lack of knowledge about chemistry coming from biologists has astounded me at times.  I'm talking about people in PhD programs or post-doc biologists.   For example, how important are buffers for almost all of molecular biology and biomedical work? Many times I've come across collaborators who work with our lab that are following a protocol to say make Tris-HCl buffer.  The pH is off so the first thing they grab is NaOH to adjust the pH.  ::Cringe::. I've seen a hella lot of people get frustrated that EDTA has a hard time dissolving in water.   They don't realize it is acidic and that the salt is much more soluble after a pH adjustment.  Other times people have been looking for drugs that contain groups like carboxylic acids, phenols, etc. from a biological sample. During the extraction process they'll use something like PBS w pH=7.4 and either wonder where their molecule went after they threw the PBS away, wonder why they have low extraction efficiency, or worse, don't even think about it all and report the numbers from their terrible extraction methods.  Sorry to rant about chemistry.  I understand chemists don't always understand basic biology or techniques a lot of times too, but as someone who does a ton of biological chemistry I see the worst of both worlds. I mean I understand a ton of biologists probably passed organic, gen chem, and biochemistry with flying colors in the classroom, but that knowledge seems to often go out the window when they're at the bench actually doing lab work. Adjusting buffers wrongly with the wrong acid/base and not even caring about ionic strength effects......that really gets me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then again, they're Hopkins students---the same ones paying ~$1400 per mo. *each* for an apartment for 4 people in the new building that opened up right on top of this place. This place will make a killing from the students, although it'll probably be impossible to find a place to sit because there will be students camped out for hours on end after buying one coffee and sitting on the computer all day while hogging space and doing their homework and BSing on the internet.  There at a lot of Hopkins kids that have no concept of money, what is considered expensive, or what being broke is like because they've been swimming in money their whole lives.  Not that it bothers me at all, they're good kids for the most part.

<TITLE> My grandmother's chocolate blancmange recipe. Nothing fancy, just delicious and simple to make. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-07 05:51:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This was my grandmother's recipe  for chocolate blancmange.  My brother and I loved this when we were kids and still do to this day.  The recipe is very easy and straightforward, have fun making it with your own children or making it for them.  You can also make it 'fancy' by aliquoting it out in any type of mold or dish if you need to make a quick dessert for a dinner party or want to impress some guests without spending a lot of time making a dessert.  It is also fantastic with some whipped cream and berries.  Just thought I'd share this recipe since I enjoyed this so much as a kid growing up.  Hopefully my grandmother would be pleased to see that other people get enjoyment from her recipe too.  


**Ingredients**

* 2oz bitter unsweetened chocolate 

* 2 Tbl  butter

* 1/3 C cornstarch

* 3/4 C sugar

* 1/4 tsp salt

* 3 C whole milk

* 1 tsp vanilla

**Directions**

1.) Melt chocolate   butter in double boiler.  If you don't have double boiler simply use a high quality bowl to lay on top of pot with boiling water.  Make sure bowl does not touch the surface of the water or is immersed in the boiling water.   

2.) Mix together cornstarch, sugar,   salt.  Stir in about 1/4 C milk, mixing well to remove lumps of cornstarch.  

3.) Add to melted chocolate   stir thoroughly.  Add the rest of  the milk   cook over direct heat, stirring constantly in a figure 8 motion until mixture boils
  thickens. 

4.) Replace over boiling water, cover, and cook 15 minutes longer. Stir occasionally.

5.) Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Cool before serving.  Makes 5 servings.

<TEXT> Hopefully they finally, finally start getting Wilmington properly developed after alllllllllllllll of these years of languish.  I don't see why Wilmington can't become say a Richmond, Va type of city.  There's great architecture in a lot of the old homes there, there simply needs to be 'things to do' to encourage people to start moving in.  That includes catering to younger families.  There is an absoluter dearth of tech industry in DE.  It would be great if Wilmington could start becoming a low tax haven to develop tech hubs that are bio and computer related.  Outside of the financial sector,  health care, and legal services, there are very little quality jobs.  Dupont is about to axe a ton of more jobs and the chemical industry is toast.  Pharma is all but gone.  Wilmington needs to strive to develop economic diversity.  It would be awesome, for example, if Wilmington provided municipal high speed internet access at a low cost like a Chattanooga, TN.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ahhhhh as a sugar biologist, this grinds my gears (although you're getting a totally biased opinion here).  For the longest time scientists ignored sugar biology, and many still do to this day,  because we've been taught DNA=protein= life from primary school.   What we started to recognize, however, at the turn of the century and several decades after the discovery of DNA was that there is an extra layer of complexity on top of the genetic code that's regulating life.  One such example is the glycocode - the entire set of sugar modifications on proteins and lipids that assist on regulating life.  It is now believed that the entire glycocode, in theory, is potentially many times more complex than the entire genetic code and it has also been described as 'one of the most complex entities in nature'.  

The cell membrane doesn't really look like what is in the video.  The cell membrane is absolutely covered in a dense layer of sugar. In fact, this sugar layer (aka glycocalyx) can sometimes be even as big or even bigger in terms of size than the cell itself, e.g. check out this 'halo' which is a hyaluronan coat around a chondrocyte:

http://imgur.com/a/nELHg

That's alllllllllll sugar, but you can often miss sugars under the microscope because you can't see them unless you do some specific types of special experiments to make them visually appear.  

All of the little lipids on the cell membrane that are dancing around in the video--covered in sugar.  All of the proteins on the surface that are shown in the video--covered in sugar.  It is also functionally very important.  For example, cholera toxin infects you by not even binding to a protein, it is able to make you sick by binding to the glycolipid known as GM1: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM1#/media/File:GM1_ganglioside.png 

Without the sugar portion, cholera can not infect. Have you ever wondered why the flu goes by the scientific name HxNy (where x and y are numbers)?  H actually stands for hemagglutinin and N stands for neuramindase.  Hemagglutin is a protein on the flu virus that recognizes and binds to a special sugar on your cells   known as sialic acid in order to infect:

[sialic acid](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roland_Schauer/publication/13546760/figure/fig8/AS:281848363143171@1444209294500/Fig-8-Functional-groups-of-sialic-acid-interacting-with-siglecs-The-functional-groups.png)

In order to escape the cell and infect other healthy cells, the flu virus then chops off sialic acids from the infected cell use N (neuramidase).  Want to also guess what one of the first lines of defense your body has against infection?  Your body produces what is known as mannose binding lectins (MBL).  Lectins are a special class of proteins that recognize and bind to sugars.  MBL recggnizes unnatural sugar patterns on the membranes of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses to trigger innate response.  

http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/Supplement_7/S440.full

How about the beginning of life?  You literally wouldn't even be born if it weren't for sugars on membranes that aren't shown in the video.  For example, in order for the sperm to bind to and find its way into an egg, a special sugar known as sialyl lewis X (sLeX for short) is absolutely required:

[sLex structure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Sialyl_lewis_x.svg/1280px-Sialyl_lewis_x.svg.png)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21852454


Development?  There's a really neat type of polymer of sugars made from sialic acids (the same sugar that the flu binds to described above) known as polysialic acid (PSA).  PSA is found at the synapses of neurons and behaves almost like a 'hydrogel'.  By regulating the amount of sugars and PSA at the ends of neurons, your body can remodel synapses and the rewiring of brain to impact learning, memory, and development:  

http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/0166-2236(96)10041-2

Finally, the video showed a lot of cell-cell/cell adhesion interactions (e.g. the selectin binding shown and the leukocyte tethering, rolling, and invasion).  Guess how that's allllllllllll regulating.  By the sugar on the surfaces of cells that are on proteins/lipids and which are not shown in the video.  Just like the sperm/egg interaction, sLeX is absolutely essential for selectin binding and is required for leukocyte tethering/rolling/invasion like what you saw in the vid. Here's a little cartoon of what is shown in the vid:
http://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/30245/fonc-02-00076-r2/image_m/fonc-02-00076-g006.jpg

All of the little hairy stuff shown in the cartoon on the cell that's rolling along the surface would be covered in sugar. Without it, your immune system and inflammatory response wouldn't work.  


TL;DR:  cranky sugar biology person rants about how sugars are important for life too and is upset they're not in the $5M video.  Goes on to give examples of how sugars can be important.

They if the fucking streets up and cause massive jams on major roads in the city everywhere because instead of having one deliver go out and deliver 10 deliveries you now have 10 cars driving to the restaurant to pick up food, which is almost always not ready because the kitchen is slammed so the drivers have to leave their cars outside double parked.  Yesterday there was a line of 8 fucking cars double parked behind each other on a 2 way street  with single lanes in each direction. This was during a busy time of the evening too when everyone is trying to get home.  Because here was sooooo much on coming traffic and because there was a long line of cars double parked ahead it made it impossible for traffic to go through. Uber eats and the like sound nice in theory until they clog up your neighborhood or commute with insane amounts of traffic because the drivers have no option other than to double park when they have to pick up from a restaurant in a busy area where parking can be hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's wishful thinking.  If the projections for hotel revenue don't turn out as planned, guess who's on the hook for the bill?  Clark County taxpayers.  There are countless examples where the projections don't come to fruition.  See the Orlando basketball arena which caused a near default on hotel tax backed bonds. Stanford economist Roger Noll also called the LV deal for $750 million in tax dollars 'the worst he's ever seen', noting that Adelson and Davis are projecting 33% of tickets going to tourists when no other NFL team even manages 10% and also said that The idea that the thing is going to pay for itself based on a huge inflow of tourists is crazy. 

And there is absolutely NO mention of the possibility that public money will be used for maintenance and operating expenses, AFAIK.

<TEXT> I still fail to see how this is 'OK'.  A tax increase is still an increase.  Americans from somewhere are paying more for something to fund the construction for a project of a privately owned team.  Why would it be 'outrageous' to increase taxes on hotels, gaming, and 'sinful foods' to fund schools and road repairs, yet if we increase taxes on hotel fees to pay for NFL stadiums it is OK?  It is OK to tax Americans who don't have the ability to vote?  I thought that's what caused this country to start a war for independence in the first place?   If you can approve say an increase from 12% hotel tax to 17% in a locality, it is still baffling why that 5% shouldn't be used to fund police, schools, roads, or to build parks for that locality.  And what happens if more and more people decide to stay home and not attend games, bad weather ravages tourism, or something else unforseable happens to decrease hotel revenue?  It won't be enough to cover the cost and bond holders will be responsible for all of the risk for building a stadium owned by a private entity.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many ways to label carbohydrates, just do a little bit of research.  Nearly 100% of the time they involve taking advantage of the fact that aldohexoses like glucose have ring opened forms w/ aldhydes at the end.  You can then do reductive amination with an array of probes.  Detection can be HPLC.  If you don't have HPLC, you can use a very handy technique that is dirt cheap known as fluorophore assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis--it is like a western blot for sugars.  Label your sugar with something like 2-aminoacridone and run the gel.  You can make a standard curve of glucose on the gel and use it to quantify the amount of glucose from your sample.  There do exist other more advanced and specialized techniques, such as PAD w/ HPLC that don't even need labeling chemistries, but a HPLC that can handle it is even more specialized and rare.  Finally, there are also all sorts of commercially available, easily do-able colometric based kits available.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the accuri c6 is a little different (strange from what some other people say who have used other FACS)--you can't change the gain and voltage--they're already optimized and fixed by BD.  They sell it as a way to make the C6 'as easy as possible' to operate for anyone.  

For your second point, I guess I don't really understand how titrating down will work. For example this is what I'm thinking:

If I have 1000 molecules X in sample A and 850 molecules of X in sample B and use 750 molecules of the clicking fluorophore I'll label 750 molecules in both A and B (assuming that the reaction is 100% efficient).  Even though 750 might be back in the dynamic range, I've lost the information that there was indeed a difference between sample A and B for molecule X since I'm now only detecting 750 in both of them. That's why I'm pretty sure that the clickable fluorophore needs to be in molar excess of molecule X.  Not an antibody biding, it is a pure organic chemistry reaction where the fluorophore must be not be the limiting reagent. 

It really would raise some eyebrows to reduce the emission/intensity of the signal for all samples by using the 585/40 filter for Alex 488?

<TITLE> Fluorescence signal over saturated in flow cytometry. Can I use a non-optimal emission filter to detect in flow cytometry in order to reduce the signal? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-15 07:16:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Haven't done a whole lot of optical/fluorescence work and have small amounts of experience working with fluorophores here.  The problem I have is that my labeling chemistry is *too* good.  I'm using alexa fluor 488 to label some cells with click chemistry.  I have a control treated with the fluorophore in order to get a background reading.  The treated sample with the clickable fluorophore labels so extremely well over the control at the proper setting (FL1-A: 488 ex 533/30 em) for alexa 488 that the fluorescence signal is off the charts and out of the dynamic range of the instrument.  If I change the setting to use FL2-A the signal is back in the dynamic range of the instrument (FLA-2 laser: 488 ex  585/40).  I'm using an accuri c6 flowcytometer.  My question is, would it be OK to report the data using the FLA2-A reading even though the emission filter is not optimal? I don't see why it wouldn't be valid as long as all of the samples use the same setting and it gets the signal back into the dynamic range of the instrument.  Is there anything wrong with this approach?

The other issue is that I really can't titrate down the fluorophore, because the goal is to click the fluorophore to as many labeled molecules as possible (fluorophore needs to be in molar excess of the molecules I'm clicking it to). Background fluorescence isn't really the problem-it's that every cell has so many clickable molecules in it that it saturates the instrument since the labeling works too well. I need to reduce the total fluoresence per cell, so I was thinking about using a different emission wavelength that wasn't optimal for alexa 488.   </TEXT>

Why aren't you just as outraged over US support for Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who is known for "unlawful killings by security forces; government-sanctioned kidnappings; systematic torture of prisoners and detainees by security forces; life threatening conditions in prisons and detention facilities; impunity; arbitrary arrest, detention, and incommunicado detention," and who is considered to be the absolutely worse piece of dictator filth in all of Africa?

The problem with the West is that in order to do business with us, we will try to enforce our ways of life on you, whether you like it or not.  Believe it or not, there are billions of people in this world that think in mindsets completely alien to Americans and Europeans.  Sometimes in order to get what you want done you need to make deals with the devils of this world without proselytizing. China understands this.  American foreign policy strategy really hasn't changed since WW2, which is a colossal mistake since there are now more players on the block , unlike after WW2 where we were pretty much the only ones available to rule the world.   It is completely ingrained in Western mindsets that other people need to think and be like us--the west has been trying to colonize people and run their countries for oh what, the last 1000 years?  It doesn't work anymore when you have major powers in the East.  How well has trying to install a Western style democracy worked in Iraq?  Or any of the other countries in the mid East that we've been trying to democratize since the 1940s?  All it has done is lead to the Iranian revolution, extreme Islam, and ISIS.  We don't always have to impose our style of democracy where it probably won't work.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the other day my sister in law, who is Thai, received a nasty letter in her door from someone in her neighborhood claiming that she and her husband are 'ruining the neighborhood' and that her 'dog was ugly' (she just got a new Rottweiler puppy).  The letter then goes on to call her a 'Chinese eggroll' and not to mess around in the neighborhood because the author apparently believes in practicing their 2nd amendment right. The letter also criticized her for marrying a 'old white guy' (who isn't even old). Btw she and her huaband are a lawyer and a manager of a restaurant and they probably easy pull in over $100k combined.  I fail to see how they're going to 'ruining a neighborhood'.  


Since when was Bear so racist that you feel intimidated toive in your own home due to hostile neighbors?  And FWIW, the sis in law didn't think the haters are white people. </TEXT>

Replace those scientists in the second article w/ my PI except we can't even get the 'bridge funding' from our institution because too many other people in our institution are competing for it.  Institutions almost never pay to fund the lab because then then would no longer be multibillion dollar behemoths.  An institution couldn't afford it either - our place spent over $2bn per year in NIH money, which is nearly the nstitutions' entire endowment.  Yes, not every scientist's lab would need institutional funding if grant money were also thrown in, but institutions would run out of money in no time at the rate biomedical scientists spend it.  Our entire floor has recently had a lot of problems with funding, including scientists and engineers named to be some of the top young scientists in the country.  If our institution is having so many problems funding research, I can only imagine it is 10x worse at other smaller schools.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This won't be popular on this sub, but I'll tell you exactly why I now watch less football compared to what I used to watch 8-10 years ago:

1.) Too many games  relative to number of days.  There's TNF, Saturday games (sometimes) Sunday, and MNF.  I watched more when it was only 2 days.  If you're a college football junkie it is even worse.  What, are you gonna blow Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun, and Mon all on football if you have a family?  And 9 AM games in England?  LOL, not happenin', I ain't getting up for that.  


2.) Fantasy has ruined football.  Yeah, people like to claim it gets them interested in games that they normally would want to watch. BS.  A ton of people no longer care about the game anymore, which is why bastardizations of the game like the NFL redzone exist.  People now have figured out you don't need to watch the game anymore and get live texts on their phones when their players score a TD.  Additionally, the fantasy novelty factor may be starting to wear off.  

3.) Too many commercials and the games take to long because of them.  A typical game will have over 100 commercials.  It is completely ironic that everyone claims a game like baseball is 'boring' because it is too slow.  The typical baseball game takes 2h 52min.  A typical football game takes 3h 12 min because of all the stoppages and advertisements. The NBA is even faster - 2h 15 min and average NHL game is 2h and 20 min.  The action in the latter sports constantly moves and because of it, it is hard to interject with commercials.  

4.) Too much criminal conduct wrt the players.  Drugs, insurance fraud, murder, drunk driving, gun shootings, you name it.  Why do NFL players get held to a different standard than the rest of us?  How many times have multiple players sexually assaulted women and are still in the NFL as stars?  How many have been arrested multiple times for DUI?  

5.)  Too hard to watch games.  I cut the cord a long time ago, and more people are doing the same.  You can't watch a game to stream because you need a cable service login or you need to subscribe to an expensive package. NFL game pass for $60 per mo to watch 100 ads per game? And to only watch 4 games that my team plays per mo?  No freakin way. 

6.) This is not my opinion, but there probably is a growing trend of people that are turned off by the whole brain injury issue.  Yes, players get paid millions of dollars to get on the field and take the risk, but at the same time some people would argue that you are enticing poor minorities off the streets with large amounts of cash to put their health on the line for our entertainment.  Again, not my opinion personally, but there are more people than you think that think like this.  

How to make it better:

1.) Go back to Sunday/Monday only.  

2.) Allow people to stream 1 free game per week by signing up with the NFL related website.  If they want more they can pay, or they can stream their ad riddled game for free.  

3.) Increase the speed of the game.  Figure out a way to cut a half an hour off.  An NHL or NBA game flies in comparison to NFL games.  Get rid of the direction changes on the field after every quarter, only do it after half time.  Get rid of the clock stoppages on incomplete passes.  Get rid of icing the kicker, it doesn't do anything and slows the game down.  Cut down on TV timeouts. Give 4 time outs total, for the entire game.  Increasing the pace can be done.  1970s games could be routinely done in under 3 hours.  



The biggest problem is due to complete oversaturation.  Watching football was more of an event when it was only on Sunday and once on Monday.  Now you have people talking about the NFL draft in March, sports analysts constantly talking about football during the Summer, and football everywhere everyday of the week except Tue/Wed.  Mark Cuban nailed it, and politics/the whole Kaepernick saga has nothing to do with my decline in watching.  You realize that my generation is really the last generation that grew up constantly with TV right?  We all did fantasy when it first started to become huge and were addicted to football because of it.  That has now warn off now that we all started to have families ourselves and have other commitments.  A TON of kids in high school and college now have grown up their entire lives in households that not only cut the cord, but grew up entirely cord free.  They have no allegiance to watching anything on TV at all.  Kids in college get pissed off if a GIF on the internet takes more than 8 seconds to get to the punchline, and you think they'll want to sit through an add laden game? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funding.  Is Academia really a sustainable career option or do you expect mass layoffs coming very soon?  I'm currently in a lab that is on its last leg.  When I first started we had 9 people, and now it is just down to me, we have 0 new grants, and the one we currently have runs out in March 2017.  We've literally submitted over a dozen grants with no luck.  It's not like my boss is a bad scientist either; we have produced good papers before, although we can no longer publish a lot of papers because I simply can't continue to do an amount of work for 5 people.  Thus we're caught in a death spiral where you can no longer publish because you don't have the hands available, and you don't have the hands available because you don't have the funding.  It just seems like the whole game is rigged against you--the NIH will help you start a lab and routinely give new PIs or PIs who have never recieved an R01 a R01, but once you get into you're mid-career you're screwed unless you are a superstar lab with 30 people.  The NIH cuts your funding off just as you're reaching the prime of career and after your lab has been setup.  Kind of disheartening to pour your life into science only to have it destroy your soul in return.  My PI has probably aged 10 years in the span of 3 years; and I'm extremely stressed out having to grind out inordinate amounts of experiments for moonshot grants.  I just don't see how this ends; it seems like academia is a ponzi scheme waiting to implode as soon as things start to go sour or your lab hits a rough patch.  This is at a top 3 insitution BTW, not a small college with non-famous professors.  Multiple Nobel winners here.   </TEXT>

The proteins will precipitate.  All it requires is chloroform, methanol, and water.  It is super easy too and you can resuspend proteins in a desired volume after.  Again, not sure of your downstream application and if this would be suitable for it.  It might also be more difficult on a small scale, but you can give it a shot for pennies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TBH, I go out of my way to drive 1 hour *away* from Baltimore/Towson/Whitemarsh area if I ever want to go to the movies.  And the movie better be pretty damn good for me to want to travel that far.  The reason I go out of my way is because I have no idea why people in this area are absolutely so obnoxious while at the theater, especially the kids around here.  Whitemarsh is a total crap show.  I've been there more than once and they pretty much almost had to call the riot police to breakup the mobs of teenagers causing trouble and getting into fights.  I mean I went to the mall and hung out at the movies when I was a kid too, but I don't ever remember causing the obscene amounts of violence that I almost always see around this area at the theaters on a Friday/Sat.  The real horror movie is in real life right outside of the theaters around here when you're trying to go to the show or get out.  I just don't understand why people around here can't refrain from the pervasive use of profanity and violence against each other.  I pretty much don't even go to the movies anymore.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't tell you in words how much eczema SUCKSSSSSS.  I've recently (for the last 3 years) been battling hand eczema and pompholyx with very little success.  When it it breaks out it can be quite painful because you literally have open sores all over your hand.  The fissures that develop are large and very deep--you could literally stick a dime in there and they'd stay.  
[Hand Eczema 1](http://www.pcds.org.uk/ee/images/made/ee/images/uploads/clinical/Hand_derm_800_526_70_http:www.pcds.org.ukeeassetsimgwatermark.gif_0_0_80_r_b_-5_-5_.jpg)

And you simply can't stop using your hands in order to let your open wounds heal.  You have to do the dishes, wash your hands before eating, take a shower, etc. etc.  The constant washing of the hands makes things worse.  I mean I try to use gloves as much as possible, but my hands will go for weeks looking like beef jerky.  Heal for 2 weeks, and then it'll come back.  Rinse and repeat non-stop, no matter what season it is too.

<TEXT> Everyone knows what credit unions are, right?  There's a reason why the banking industry like WF et. al. have tried for decades to kill credit unions, and that's because of the fact that they're non-profit organizations that are consumer friendly.  Credit unions are literally your friend. 

It only takes a small amount of time if you really, really want to 'stick it to the system'.  Imagine if everyone got home and auto loans and banked with credit unions.  Trillions of dollars would be funneled away from for profit enterprises and back towards the consumer.  The convenience argument also hold very little water.  I've used credit unions for the past 20 years and it has never been a major issue.  Tons and tons of gas stations have free ATM withdraws.  I almost never carry cash anyways these days, because like most people, all  I mostly do do is swipe a card anyway for a payment.  Even if you need to deposit from far away, many credit unions form networks where you can make a deposit anywhere and they'll process it to your account for free.  A lot of credit unions will also let you take a picture of a check and put the money in there for you.  All you have to do is mail it in.  Really little excuse to not have a credit union account.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my take on this and I know it might not be popular:

1.) a lot of people are turned off by the constant criminal behavior of the players who still get rewarded with big contracts.  From insurance fraud, murder, gun violence, and drugs to sexually assaulting women, players have done it all and are still on the field.

2.) health concerns.  Yes, a small but sizable amount of people do care about the detrimental effects of playing football for one's brain health.  Yes, the players get paid millions of dollars to put their health on the line, but many would argue that we're paying poor minorities to bust up their brains on the field for our entertainment.  Not my opinion personally, but there are a lot of people that think like this.

3.) The fantasy football wave of popularity is starting to die.  The NFL really was never as popular as it is today until fantasy football started taking over the sport.  Fantasy cheapened the sport to just constant bombardment of Red Zone plays every 2 minutes.  Who cares about the game, all everyone cares about is if their fantasy players are scoring TDs.  Well, the novelty is starting to wear off from fantasy, and I wouldn't be surprised if either participation in fantasy has plateaued due to saturation or a lot of casual fans just move on. Don't get me wrong, fantasy football is still huge, but its probably already peaked.  

4.) The insane amount of advertising.  Should I really have to sit and watch 100 commercials in order to watch the browns get their asses kicked by the patriots?  

The Kaep effect?  Meh, minimal, I don't care about it at all.  I'll tell you exactly why I watch less games and NFL: I simply have shit to do on the weekend and can't burn an entire day in front of the TV watching commercials.  I quit fantasy after playing for 15 years--the novelty has completely worn off. The only thing I care about now is just watching the Eagles' games and that's it.  Mon/Thurs. night football are meaningless to me now unless my team is playing.  It's like baseball or hockey, I don't care about watching other teams play until it is the playoffs.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem though, is that the reverse isn't always true: just because you have gene X expressed doesn't mean at all that it equates to protein level.  I can't tell you how many times I've experimentally come across the situation where my western blots have the reverse levels of protein that one would have predicted from gene data.  Does not correlate at all many times.  If you knock out the gene though, of course you'll effect protein levels. That's what makes it hard, the converse isn't always true. Worse yet, protein level can also not correlate with function at all.  Right now I have two types of cancer I'm working on and cell line X has the same or less of protein A as cell line Y.  What's peculiar however is the fact that protein A seems to be much more active in cell line X.  I can directly measure the amount of metabolite the protein produces, and in cell line X, it produced several fold more metabolite than cell line Y even though cell line Y has the same or even more of protein A.   Disease is still more complex than this, as there are still several more layers of organization that are completely outside what is encoded directly in the genome.  I mean I suppose you could target the gene expression w things like RNAi (though the tech isn't there yet), but targeting the protein products seems less clear, to me at least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chemistry is probably the worst of all the fields.  How many times do you ever see % yields reported with +/- errors? Virtually never. That's because we all know chemistry just either A.) tries a reaction once, and as long as they validate the structure it is OK so that means the reaction is good or B.) report only the results for a reaction attempt that provided the highest yield.  No one in synthetic organic chemistry is repeating reactions 3,4,5x and reporting the variance of the yields obtained.  It just isn't standard practice in a field like chemistry.   </TEXT>

Ask yourself, should you even attempt to answer a biological question if you know you can't obtain a highly powered study?  What if it takes 10 months of work to grow a cell line, engineer it,  and then test it?  It is almost impossible to replicate that from square 1 5, 6, 7 times in order to obtain a more highly powered experiment.  There are inherent limitations to biology that simply can't be overcome, as of yet, for a lot of scientific problems.  Should that limit us to what we can ask? It is easy to obtain giant sample sizes if you do things like study populations in fields like ecology, epidemiology, or whatever, but it is literally inhumanly, and even economically, impossible to get say 30 independently tested samples for every single type of experiment that you try in a field like molecular biology.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It isn't always THAT simple.  We once had someone from NIST come in to give our group a talk.  In one series of experiments, they gave out the same exact cell lines, same exact reagents, and same exact protocols to different labs across the country in order to test toxicity of compound X  on the cells.  The assay was very, very straight forward (like a MTT assay).  The results that the labs sent in to NIST were shocking.  The IC50 values calculated by different labs varied by as much as 1-2 orders of magnitude, IIRC.  Nobody was doing anything knowingly wrong or with any malfeasance in play; the huge degree of variance simply came down to scientist skill, lab location, type of pipettes, etc. etc.  In order to cut down on the variance, NIST eventually figured out an insane, absolutely not obvious,  zig-zagging pattern in order to add the reagents to the cells.  If something like a simple cell toxicity assay can't be repeated without 1-2 orders of magnitude of difference, how can we possibly expect a huge chunk of science to be replicated when many procedures and experiments require many dozens of steps, months or even years of work, proprietary/non-common items, different levels of skill, different locations, etc. etc.?  The gravitational field strength at your lab's location probably comes into play at this rate.   </TEXT>

Complete rip off.  If you want to save even more money, a straight edge razor is awesome, but takes a looooooooot of practice and takes a lot more maintenance.

<TEXT> Yup, they're trying!  For example, people have been trying for years to make cancer vaccines against the Thomsen Freidenreich antigen which is a sugar.  They haven't been quite successful yet, but they're trying.  People have also been trying for years to develop things like antibodies against cancer specific glycan epitopes (these are called tumor associated carbohydrate antigens or TACAs for short in case you want to do more research).  Success has been fleeting, but I've seen some encouraging progress that has been presented at recent cancer conferences. 

Making vaccines and antibodies against glycans *is hard*, which is why people haven't been quite successful yet.  I suspect it also has to do with the same reasons why protein people are also often unsuccessful--they often ignore the carbohydrate covering of their proteins--and in a similar manner, carbohydrate people tend to think the sugar is more important.  What needs to probably be tried are more efforts aimed at developing antibodies and therapies that are able to recognize *both* the carbohydrate AND the protein parts of a molecule that can be used to target cancer.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question.  If O-GlcNAc is so important it should have feed back controls, right?  In fact this is definitely true.  An enzyme known as GFAT is known as the 'gateway' into the HBP; it is feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc production, so yes, in theory there should be a cap on the amount of UDP-GlcNAc a cell produces so that it doesn't start become 'sick'.  In reality, a lot of stuff goes wrong.  For example, in cancer we known that total global levels of O-GlcNAc are consistently overabundant.  Why doesn't the feedback mechanism work anymore?  In other disaeses such as diabetes and Alzheimer's, patterns of O-GlcNAcylation are also different, which seems to suggest that the flux through the HBP is probably perturbed (why?). 

Has increased sugar consumption been shown to alter patterns of O-GlcNAcylation?  People are trying!  For example, here's a reference where they fed mice a 'western diet' and observed changes in O-GlcNAcylation in the rat heart:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372663/

Clearly more work needs to be done, but what seems to be emerging is that yes, in fact, diet can influence patterns of O-GlcNAcylation and this goes on to do things like affect epigenetics, gene expression, etc. etc. since all of the proteins involved are modified by O-GlcNAc.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Biochemistry is never that easy.  Imagine biochemical networks as a network of pipes, with each pipe having a different diameter.  What's regulating a large aspect of life would be akin to 'how fast' or 'how much' water would be flowing through the pipes.  Think of it like an electronic circuit.  What's important are the amounts of electrons flowing through it.  But it isn't as simple as fixing an amount for use.  A cell has to be able to adapt to stresses and the environment.  What a cell will do is start changing the diameters of the pipes in order to regulate 'the flow' going through the network.  A cell is a mindblowing and an extraordinarily engineered machine with all sorts of feedback control mechanisms to turn on and off pathways in order to regulate flux.  For example, why doesn't your AC constantly stay on as it cools down your house?  It has a feedback control mechanism to say 'enough is enough' when your house is cool enough.  Similarly, a cell has control mechanism to regulate and change the amount of O-GlcNAc it needs in order to respond to stress--more O-glcnac is generally 'protective' during times of accute stress, for example.

<TEXT> Good questions!  And they're all big reasons why sugar biology and O-GlcNAc are so tough to crack.

1.) you can IP using O-GlcNAc recognizing antibodies (and the the reverse IP as well) in order to see if your protein of interest is O-GlcNAcylated.  Beware, not easy and has given me many gray hairs over the years!  Other than that, there really aren't good ways to do it outside of extremely specialized mass spectrometry techniques that most labs  can't do.  

2.)  No, no known consensus motifs exist that can predict sites of O-GlcNAcylation.  All we know is that it occurs on SER/THR residues.  There are some hypotheses floating out there trying to explain why and where it will occur, but nothing solid yet (again why it's so hard to understand). 

3.) No, the O-GlcNAc modification is an intracellular sugar modification (like phosphorylation).  It is probably on most, if not all proteins at some point in their life (this includes all intracellular proteins).  Nearly all transcription factors are O-GlcNAcylated (e.g. big ones in cancer such as MYC has its half life regulated by O-GlcNAc and the entire core machinery that regulates stem cell differentiation is regulated by O-GlcNAc, for example).  

4.) Something they're working on, but nothing exists yet AFAIK.  The only way is look through the literature yourself.  I believe some websites for proteins might list 'predicited sites for O-GlcNacylation', but that's about it.  It tends to be a big deal if you prove a new protein is O-glcnacylated since the work is probably novel, so if it interests you go ahead and try!  There's a good chance you'll get a decent publication out of it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lame answer: everything in moderation.  

I know, I know, not what you're looking for, but there's a big, big leap from understanding what happens at the molecular level to making macro level guidelines for people, but that's certainly an active area of research (albeit one I don't really keep dibs on).  But without question, we know a bad diet high in sugar can lead to things like diabetes and and pre-diabetes.  Diabetics are more at risk for developing heart disease.  What I can not say is how much sugar or what types of sugars a person can and can not consume.  I'm not a epidemiologist or anything, but how prevalent was heart disease an diabetes back when our grandparents were young?  How about before sugar became widely and cheaply available?  Did ancient civilizations avoid grain?  I tend to think not, as bread has been a staple for millennia for many civilizations.  Even to this day, countries with lower rates of diabetes and hear disease still consume huge quantities of staples like rice.  

We are increasing our understanding between cellular/tissue abnormal sugar consumption and the development of heart disease, but the other thing we don't understand well is what gets a cell or tissue to consume sugar abnormally in the first place?  Too much sugar in the diet? Probably, but not the only answer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely.  Heh, and what's also true is that the 'yin-yang' hypothesis also isn't true, but people often like to describe it that way for lay people.  One case never discussed:  What if O-GlcNAc has its own very unique sites for addition?  In reality that's true.  Consider how many combinatorial possibilities there are now with a single protein in this hypothetical example--2 sites where O-GlcNAc/phosho cycle, another site where only phospho is added, and another 2 sites where only O-GlcNAc is added.  I'll let you do the math, but the number is astounding!  Certainly much more complex than a simple yin-yang description.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting idea--that humans do not contain hydroxylated sialic acids while most other mammals do.  When we consume things like red meat we break down mammalian tissue and release things like Neu5gc.  Neu5Gc is then uptaken by our cells and appears on the surfaces of our cells, and because it is unnatural for humans, it supposedly elicits an immune/inflammatory response.  Such is the reason why Varki has hypothesized a diet rich in animal products is linked to the development of chronic inflammation and/or things like colon cancer.  It's interesting for sure, but there's still a lot more work that needs to be done.  Just keep in mind sugars are rapidly turned over, so while we may incorporate Neu5Gc onto our cells, it isn't there permanently.  For now, just keep things to a moderation. 


BTW, the much more interesting thing wrt to Neu5gc, imo, is how might possibly explain the evolution of the human brain and the development of our intelligence.  On this topic Varki has some very, very interesting hypotheses.  The ends of synapses of neurons are heavily decorated with sialic acids (NeuNAc).  By remodeling the levels of sialic acids on synapses, neurons are able to 'rip apart' and reconnect in different ways--in otherwords sialic acids are heavily heavily involved in the molecular physiology of neuronal plasticity.  But what Varki discovered is that the gene that allows primates to synthesize Neu5gc (CMAH) mutated *right around the time we started evolving from apes into homo sapiens*; the mutation completely inactivated CMAH and no longer allowed us to produce Neu5Gc.  And because sialic acids are so heavily invovled in learning, memory, and the development of our brain (how does Neu5gc vs NeuNAc change this process?), Varki has hypothesized that the mutation of the CMAH gene helped us become what we are today.  Very interesting to readup on:

<TEXT> I would say equally, if not more complex.  Basically no one knows how to decipher the 'O-GlcNAc code' (see here):

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3783028/


What are we really asking?  We know O-Glcnac regulates has the potential to regulate the entire physiology of genetic output and proteome activity.  Basically what's happening is that a cell is dynamically responding 'to the amount of sugar and metabolites being pushed through to make UDP-GlcNAc'.  That concept is flux.  Based on the flux of a sugar, can we not only predict WHAT proteins might change O-GlcNAcylation states, but exactly WHERE on the those proteins O-GlcNAcylation might change.  For example, during starvation protein X might have no O-GlcNAc while in a fed state protein X has 3 O-GlcNAcs which will help it turn 'off'.  However duringa starvation state protein Y might have 2 O-GlcNAcs.  During a fed state it might now have 3.  But more importantly, we need to know exactly where those O-GlcNAcs are being added and removed--maybe they're at a site that blocks another molecule from docking, maybe it is on a distant site of protein that changes the shape of the protein and the way it entirely behaves.  Maybe O-GlcNAc signals for the protein to be sent for desctruction.  The list goes on.  Understanding how metablic flux of sugar regulates proteome o-glcnacylation AND the physiological consequences is something that's vastly, vastly complex and something no one understands.  It is like solving a massive quantum mechanics puzzle.  I mean we know 'the amount of sugars going through biochemical pathways' regulates the patterns of O-GlcNAc we see, but there's no predictive formula that'll allow us to tell what will change and what will happen.  In short, cracking the O-GlcNAc code is a non-deterministic problem.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> ohhhhhhhhhhhh boy, huge topic.  You bet we do!  One of the first hallmarks every described with respect to cancer was the discovery that cancer cells and tissues have 'abnormal' types of sugar coatings on their surface.  What does 'abnormal' mean?  Well, if you were to molecularly analyze the surfaces of cancer cells for the sugar portions only, you'd find extremely strange patterns, such as sugar glycans that only are known to appear during a stage like early development.  Why do they all of the sudden appear then in cancer?  You'll also find sugar patterns that shouldn't normally be found in the type of tissue where the cancer is (e.g. a type of sugar pattern that is only found normally in the brain is now all of the sudden appearing in breast tissue that is cancerous).  Long story short, we can tell a cell is sick by looking at the patterns of sugars on its surface.  

And how might this assist cancer cell growth?  There's a lot of reasons why sugar coatings can help cancer cells grow, but I'll only focus on the topic of immune evasion since immuno oncology and immuno therapy is so hot right now.  A type of sugar known as 'sialic acid' (my screen name! ) is often found to be overabundant on cancer--again, one of the first things we ever discovered about cancer.  Many, many years later, a scientist at UCSD by the name of Ajit Varki made the discovery that there are special receptors on immune cells called sialic acid immunoglobulin type lectins (SIGLECs for short).  When SIGLECs on immune cells bind to sialic acid the immune cells are basically 'turned off'.  In this way, the overabundance of sialic acids on the surfaces of cancer are probably helping the tumor to grow and avoid immune detection because of the SIGLEC-sialic acid interaction.  There are tons of papers out there on this, search for Varki.  Start with the book chapter on Sialic Acids and Siglecs here as well as the references below:

<TEXT> Sugar biologist here.  The role of sugar and carbohydrates in disease has started to gain traction and there is a small, but loud community of us 'glycobiologists' that is increasingly growing in number as time goes by.  In fact, MIT once predicted that sugar biology will revolutionize medicine in the 21st century, because it may be a big piece of the puzzle towards our understanding of many complex diseases, the root causes of which we still haven't really understood well nearly 2 decades after we've cracked the genetic code.  

What do you think of when you think of the word 'sugar'? You're probably thinking of table sugar and high fructose corn syrup, both of which you consume in food.  You might also be thinking about glucose, the key energy carrying molecule every cell in your body burns for energy in order to maintain life.  For the longest time that's what most people in the scientific community thought when they thought about 'sugars'.  But there's a different  and an extremely important role sugars play in regulating life.  After a huge number of proteins are made that are encoded in your genome, they are modified further by a theoretically massive set of sugars.  This entire set of sugars in known as 'the glycome' (akin to the genome, proteome, metabolome, etc.).  Just how big is the glycome?  Well, many scientists have reported that it is theoretically 'many orders of magnitude more complex than the genome' and that it is 'one of the most complex entities known in nature'.  When you think about it, taking the genetic products and modifying them with sugars is almost like a quantum leap in complexity for life.  Genetics and DNA would be tantamount to our understanding of classical physics.  Just as classical physics can't explain all physical phenomena, we now know that a huge portion of the complexity of life exists outside what can be coded directly in DNA (for example the glycome).  The study of sugars, their modifications on proteins, and the functional role that this has could be considered like the quantum revolution that physicists needed to explain the nature of fundamental particles and small scale stuff.  


But there's one type of modification by sugar that's quite special.  Back many decades ago two scientists by the names of Krebs and Fischer discovered that proteins were modified by phosphorylation (phospho groups) to regulate their activity.  To simply put it (in reality it isn't this simple), when a protein is phosphorylated it is 'turned on', and when it is dephosphorylated it is 'turned off'.  Kinases are enzymes that add phospho groups and phosphatases are enzymes that remove phospho groups from proteins.  There are literally hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of different kinases and phosphatases that exist in order to regulate the phosphorylation states of all proteins in a cell.  For their work, Krebs and Fischer won the Nobel Prize in medicine (to illustrate the importance of protein physiology regulation).  However, nearly two decades later after Krebs and Fischer discovered protein phosphorylation, scientists soon discovered that hundreds and thousands of proteins inside of a cell were also modified by a single sugar known as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc for short).  This observation was later dubbed 'the O-GlcNAc modificaiton' and 'O-GlcNAc'.   After a ton of grunt work, scientists were able to show that what really, really made O-GlcNAc interesting was that O-GlcNAc appeared to modify proteins often times *at the same exact sites* where proteins were phosphorylated (remember how important that was for Krebs and Fischer?).  And what really, really, really, really made the addition of O-GlcNAc super duper special was the discovery that only 2 enzymes regulate the addition and removal of O-GlcNAc to proteins--an enzyme known as OGT (which adds it) and OGA (which removes it).  That's it!  Contrast that to the hundreds and thousands of different kinases and phosphatases that are needed to regulate the phosphorylation states of the proteome.  O-GlcNAc is much more conserved.  The importance of O-GlcNAcylation can not be overstated.  Think of O-GlcNAc as a 'cap' on the sites of proteins where they are phosphorylated.  In order to phosphorylate and turn proteins 'on', you must first remove O-GlcNAc to clear the site for modification by phosphorylation.   In otherwords, O-GlcNAc is also a master regulator of the entire physiology of proteins inside of a cell.  It is like the yin-to-the-yang of phosphorylation.  This observation has now been called the 'Yin-Yang hypothesis'.  After 30 years of more work, we are increasingly understanding the importance of O-GlcNAc.  For example, nearly every type of protein involved in epigenetic modifications and regulation is now known to be modified by O-GlcNAc.  Nearly every type of transcription factor (proteins that help to turn on a gene) are modified by O-GlcNAc.  RNA polymerase II, the main protein that decodes your DNA, is heavily O-GlcNAcylated and doesn't work right unless it is coated with sugar.  Histones (the proteins that your DNA wraps around) are modified by O-GlcNAc, meaning O-GlcNAc is directly part of the histone code.   In fact, if you were to stain your chromatin (basically your DNA) for O-GlcNAc it would light up like a Christmas tree, meaning your DNA mass and all of the proteins on it are absolutely covered in sugar. O-GlcNAc also regulates cytoskeletal structure and dynamics, many proteins inside of the mitochondria, mitochondrial cellular mechanics, modifies the proteins that regulate circadian rhythm.....the list goes on.  

So what does this have to do with 'sugar consumption' and heart disease?  Well, what I didn't discuss yet is *where* exactly the GlcNAc that is used for the O-GlcNAc modification comes from.  When most people think of glucose metabolism, they think about using it for glycolysis and oxidative phoshorylation--i.e. using glucose as fuel for a cell.  However, what many scientists outside of glycobiology and biochemistry and the general lay public might not have ever heard of is the fact that roughly 2-5% of all glucose turn over is shunted away from glycolysis and energy production and down a biochemical pathway known as the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).   The HBP does several transformations to glucose, but ultimately it produces a very special metabolite known as UDP-GlcNAc.  UDP-GlcNAc is THE substrate for OGT (remember that's the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc to proteins).   While 2-5% of glucose shunting down the HBP doesn't seem like a lot, it really is because of the massive turn over rate of glucose that exists in a cell.  In fact, I've repeatedly been told that next to ATP, UDP-GlcNAc is the next most abundant molecule found in a cell (further illustrating its importance).   If you can finally see the big picture here, we are, for the first time linking carbohydrate metabolism, carbohydrate uptake, carbohydrate fluxes, and 'sugar consumption' directly to virtually every single aspect of physiology inside of a cell since the O-GlcNAc modification modifies so many things like what was discussed above.  The link is O-GlcNAc and the HBP with glucose.    More directly, how is this relevant to heart disease?   There are many, many things to discuss on this topic alone, but I will defer to the abstracts posted here to get you started:

**Cardiac O-GlcNAc signaling is increased in hypertrophy and heart failure.**  
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22128088


**O-linked -N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) is indispensable in the failing heart**:

http://www.pnas.org/content/107/41/17797.full

**Spliced X-box Binding Protein 1 Couples the Unfolded Protein Response to Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway**
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959665/


**Protein O-GlcNAcylation and Cardiovascular (Patho)physiology**

http://www.jbc.org/content/289/50/34449.full

The point is just to explain to you exactly how sugar might, and is probably involved in the development of heart disease.  
We've long observed that diabetic patients have higher risks for things like heart disease and cardiomyopathy.  What do diabetics have?  Of course they have dysregulated sugar metabolism which will probably go on to aversely affect normal O-GlcNAc cycling.  Maybe O-GlcNAc is the reason why diabetics are more prone to heart disease.  In fact, many major disease that affect millions of people every year such as cancer, diabetes, and even Alzheimer's are all associated with dysregulated sugar metabolism and abnormal patterns of O-GlcNAc.  Now you might have some inkling as to how sugar metabolism is, probably, in some way involved in the development and progression of many major diseases.  


TL; DR:  Scientists discovered that sugars play an important role in regulating how proteins work.  The sugar that does that comes from glucose and glucose consumption.  The links between abnormal 'sugar uptake' and conditions like heart disease are becoming increasingly clear.  The science on the molecular level is there!

<TEXT> From Jan. to the end of July '16 there were 16 robberies and assaults with either a knife or gun in CV.  Within just the past month (Aug.) up to now, there have been approx. 7 assaults and robberies in CV committed with a gun and/or knife.  The level of crime which originally took 3 months  to reach from the rate of crime during Jan. - July of this year has been achieved in a little less than 1.5 months now from Aug-Sept., meaning the rate of crime in CV appears to be increasing.  Just this week a man was accosted by a group of individuals who had multiple guns and a knife at 29th and St. Paul.  He was stabbed.  Another guy was also robbed at 30th and St. Paul/Calvert by a suspect with a metal rod for a weapon.  The first incident took place at 5 freakin' o'clock in the afternoon, and the other took place at 140 PM--both occurred in broad daylight and not in areas anywhere where it would be considered 'unsafe' and against common sense to go.  It is starting to worry me that criminals are becoming more brazen in and around CV.  What can I do or give to protect my wife who I'm starting to worry about?  I can't be there when she walks home from work from the stop since I'm still at work.  Obviously guns, mace/pepper spray, knives are illegal.  What else should I or she do?  She has to walk all in the areas where violent crime has recently been reported.   </TEXT>

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/world/asia/an-illicit-trail-of-african-ivory-to-china.html?_r=0

From the article: *Ivory is etched deeply into the Chinese identity. Popular lore tells of emperors who believed ivory chopsticks would change color upon contact with poisoned food. In Chinese medicine, ivory powder is said to purge toxins from the body and give a luminous complexion. As part of its public relations effort to legitimize the trade, the government in 2006 added ivory carving to its official Intangible Cultural Heritage register, along with traditional opera, kung fu and acupuncture.*


I'm just wondering if you can genetically engineer a tusk so that if consumed, it'll poison you.  It would even make artwork more hazardous, as ivory dust particles would also be toxic if breathed in while making art if someone was using a burr or something to shape an art piece.

Dmitry did an amazing job for me.  

http://yourtailorforlife.com/


It was about $130 total for major work:  1.) pair of jeans hemmed 2.) suit jack sleeves shortened  3.) jacket body shorted  4.) suit pants hemmed 5.) crotch fixed  6.) leg slimmed and tapered.  

You get what you pay for, especially for something like tailoring.  Maybe the amount of alterations you'll need will be less than what I needed, but that gives you an idea of his prices.  Turn around time was 2 days IIRC.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know you absolutely can't park right on top of stop signs, that's illegal in basically every state.  FWIW, this site says MD prohibits parking within 30 feet of a stop sign:

http://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2010/transportation/title-21/subtitle-10/21-1003


I'm fine w/ just enforcing the rule for parking too close to a stop sign.  Also, giving tickets to people that actually park in a crosswalk should be enforced and would help.  And finally, if cars are allowed to park right up to the corner, a mirror across the street to help drivers see oncoming traffic really wouldn't hurt now would it?  It gets really hairy when a something like a delivery truck or a moving truck parks right up to the corner and completely obstructs your view nearly 100%.  I mean I've learned a lot of tricks when normal cars park such as looking across the street at the cars for a reflection in their paint, but it doesn't always work if a larger vehicle is blocking your view.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Who do I complain to about parking too close to intersections and stop signs? Diving is ridiculously treacherous in CV in the morning. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-09 05:26:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> All throughout CV you might have a T or cross intersection where traffic on the cross street is extremely heavy.  The street you're driving on might have a stop sign at the intersection.  Cars now are routinely, and I mean almost everyday 365, park right on top of the stop signs or right until the edge of the corner of the intersections, making it virtually impossible to see if it is safe or not to drive through the intersection without either A.) driving into the cross walk to see or B.) flooring it when you think it is 'safe', but often time it can be close.  If you can't visualize what I'm talking about, here's a crappy pic:

http://imgur.com/a/rybnm


I mean I know it is already illegal to park right next to or on top of the stop sign, which no one enforces around here.  But it looks like there was already a discussion over the idea that in fact is indeed illegal to park within 30 feet of an intersection:

https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1n0y9u/no_parking_within_30_feet_of_intersection/

Probably for safety reasons--it's literally impossible to see oncoming traffic when people park right on the corners.  Who do I talk to in order to get meter maids to enforce the laws?  I mean is it quite ridiculous how people park in CV--right on top of the stop sign and even on top of the ped x walks. all over night too.  If they don't want to enforce the laws, can I at least ask for mirrors to be placed on a pole at intersections? </TEXT>

<TEXT> PC researcher here.  The problem is that when you are diagnosed with PC it is already too late.  No one has really figured out a way to reliably detect precancerous lesions that end up leading to PC but which are very survivable if caught.  

Be honest, would you want your family to spend $150,000 to increase your life span by a few . months?  Sure, there was one or two survivors out past one year and even 3 years, but the sample size is so small it might not even be statistically significant.  PC is 95-98% lethal, yet what if that survivor is just part of that 2-5% anyway that ends up living?  I'll reserve judgement until a larger trial happens.  We have a much much much less successful time with immuno therapy against solid tumors.  I mean we are seeing success in lung and skin cancer , and quite robust success w blood cancers, but different kinds of cancers pose different problems with their abilities to shut down the immune system, tissue access, etc etc.   </TEXT>

"This is unsustainable," he said.

If you're stuck w/ the company, why not spend 30 minutes testing the pipettes yourself by weighing water, and then only hand over the pipettes that need to be calibrated to help cut down on cost?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> one for the wife, and one for myself.  6 gb data.  verizon.  that's with a organizational discount too.  yes, it's expensive.  i've debated moving after this contract.  it used to be $80 a little while ago (5-6 years ago), Verizon has gone insane.  


Still, $170/12 months = $14 per mo.  That's $4-5 per month per person for a family, as the article implies.  Who doesn't have $4-5 per month for each family member for clean water?  Meanwhile people pay for cell phones, buy too many clothes, throw away food, drive cars they can't really afford, go out to eat too much, etc. etc.  $5 extra per month per person?  OUTRAGEOUS!  Did people already forget how much of a clusterfuck of traffic all of those water main breaks over the last 3 years caused from decaying infrastructure? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Folks-
 
     We are starting to have a rash of complaints in which a motorist stops to pick up a purse laying on the side of a sparsely travelled road.  Our suspects then jump out of brush or a cornfield and rob the victim (usually a female).  If you see a purse laying on the shoulder or in the roadway, please do not stop.  Note the location and call 911 so we can go pick up the purse and check the area.  Please feel free to forward to friends and family.
     Take care.

<TITLE> Recommendations for the most robust chromatography-MS system for metabolomics/proteomics/glycomics analysis </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-28 20:45:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The PI and a few others would like to get together and write a major large instrument grant for a MS system that can do all of the above types of analysis (if possible).  I've been asked to do some research in order to help write this grant.  I'm not an analytical chemist by trade, but have extensive experience with chromatography (not MS though).  Are there any recommendations on what kinds of MS systems to couple to a chromatographic system?  I'm assuming we should be looking for liquid chromatography (not GC, etc?--I dunno, I don't normally do this kind of work and only analyze small molecules).  Should we be looking for MS^n capabilities with ion traps?  It's sort of like a chicken an egg thing--we can't attract experts in proteomics/metabolomics until we have the instrumentation, but we can't get the instrumentation until we have the experts.  But any manufacturers, setups, and types of MS recommendations for routine metabolomics/proteomics/glycomics analysis would be extremely helpful.  Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except this random redditor has worked in the pharmaceutical industry as a professional biomedical scientist.  You don't have to take my word for it, fine, this is the exact protocol for schools in CA:

http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/lib/sde/pdf/deps/student/health/steps_in_the_emergency_use_of_an_epinephrine_autoinjector.pdf

9.Take the victim's vital signs (if trained to do so) and record them. Duplicate the emergency card for the paramedics. **When paramedics arrive** tell them the time EpiPen was administered and the dose administered. If EpiPen has not been disposed of in a sharp's container, give the expended EpiPen to the paramedics.

10.If symptoms continue and paramedics do not arrive, use a new EpiPen and re-inject 15 to 20 minutes after initial injection. Continue to monitor the victim's airway and breathing.

11.**Follow-up medical care should be obtained at the emergency room or from the victim's physician**. A second delayed reaction may occur up to 6 hours after the initial anaphylaxis.


because I'm sure CEOs like Shrkelli aren't trying to portray their strategies as nothing but just...sorry, but Epipens absolutely don't entirely prevent the need for hospital visits/ambulance rides at all.

-the absolutely bizzare and brazen red light runners, and no I don't mean people trying to beat a light *turning* red. I mean all of the douche bags around here that sit at a solid light that has been red for like 10 seconds who then decide basically 'fuck this' and blow through the light

-all of the double parked cars, especially in Mt. Vernon during rush hour.  Just because you put on your hazards doesn't mean you can park wherever you want and cause a massive traffic jam.

-people who feel the need to drive 65 mph on 28 and 29th streets.  People who feel the need to drive 85 mph on I 83.  Dude, calm down before you kill people

-all the people around here who give  0 fucks and turn right on red at intersections that clearly say NO TURN ON RED.

-people who go 2 mph on the on ramp to 83 from 29th.  Pick up speed, going slow and trying to merge makes it more dangerous.

-the shit ton of people around here who do the opposite of driving with high beams on and simply drive around with no lights on at night.

-the people behind you  who honk  and cuss at you for not running pedestrians over when you have to yield when making a right turn . </TEXT>

<TEXT> You said, and I exactly quote, ' video about how you can't turn left at a stop light'.  A.) like you pointed out, you are absolutely allowed to make a left on red from a one way to another one way in nearly every state with a few exception, so the all encompassing claim that you can't turn left at a stop light is wrong.  B.) it doesn't even have to be from a one way to another one way either, for example here's WA driving code:

http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.055

*Vehicle operators facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection control area and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. However, the vehicle operators facing a steady circular red signal may, after stopping proceed to make a right turn from a one-way or two-way street into a two-way street or into a one-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the right turn; or a left turn from a one-way or two-way street into a one-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the left turn; unless a sign posted by competent authority prohibits such movement.*

In other words, you can make left turns on red no matter what type of road you're on as long as the left you're making is onto a one way road.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Esmail could take a crap on your TV screen yet the fanboys would eat it up and still vehemently claim.this is the best shit that has ever graced the boob tube.  This season is a goddamn mess beyond belief.  It took 3-4 episodes for Angela to help hack the FBI, and what'd we get? 0 mention of the dark army and some background phone call crap about bearanstain that got blown off after 3 minutes.  A shit ton of FBI agents were literally murdered on Chinese soil and all we have is well time to move on Dom. It took 4-5 episodes to establish e coins were taking over and 6 episodes to reveal what we all suspected--that Elliot is in jail.or in a mental institution.  And worse yet, 8 EPs in and 0 Tyrell, we don't know what Elliott did w the gun, and we still don't know really any Tyrrells wife killed the valet who saw his car after 5/9.  Speaking of which, has Tyrrells wife been around the last 2-3 EPs?  No?  Just more example of bad script writing.

Literally the most incompressible, most disjoint season 2 ever. I like Mr. Robot, don't get me wrong, but it isn't the best show ever.   I get it, fanboys get off on all of the Easter eggs and tech junkie service jobs, but you still have to write a good and coherent drama to captivate the viewers. </TEXT>

I had to TA a large undergraduate class, and you would not believe how many students had so much trouble submitting homework on time, understanding the grading to know what the consequences were, or even when some things were even due.  Everything was in the syllabus.....and the best part is that the students get to rip your a good one at the end of the year on course evaluations when they blow chunks and get a bad grade.  It's always someone else's fault for their bad grades, of course.   </TEXT>

Several scenes from Warrior with Tom Hardy:

Final fight with Michael Jai White from Blood and Bone (excellent):

Scott Adkins also has a shit ton of beautifully choreographed, non-CGI action scenes like this (he should have been Batman too):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkCfPjeux5o



You can't make action scenes 'realistic' outside of war films or boxing movies.  One punch to the face will knock a person out a huge percentage of the time, thus a truly 'realistic' fight scene would be quite boring for a movie.

*This is comparable to chlorination and biosand filtration, which have the highest production rates of prevalent point-of-use water treatment methods, and far exceeds typical production rates for solar disinfection*

We all know the whole story revolves around ECorp and E-Coins, yet it's taken 7 episodes and will take more (apparently) to show how the entire banking system is toast and all money for the economy will now be digital.  During this latest episode I found myself checking my fantasybaseball team during it while half listening, something I've found myself doing a lot this season.

<TEXT> No, you will not be at a huge competitive disadvantage, you know why?  Because tons and tons and tons of fantasy pundits *already do use them*.  All you have to do is simply spend 10 minutes per week reading fantasy columns for free that are available all over.  Spend another 10 minutes reading reddit posts on this sub because everyone else has already done the work for you and wants to sound smart.  There are a lot of owners in our league that spend hours on fangraphs who think they'll get and advantage, but they don't really, the physician in our league is in first.  That's what happens when you have a tool like the internet.  Information is literally perfect.  The only way to gain the upperhand on your opponents is if somehow information becomes asymmetic or you do some sort of strategy that is completely off the wall.  That's the reason the physician in our league has stayed in for so long and has done so well while giving 0 craps about baseball or fantasy research.  You can literally assemble at least a .500 team by drafting from the top 300 lists places everywhere provide--they've already done the sabermetrics for you.  After the draft it is a coinflip with injuries, luck, .....and yes, there will be some breakouts so some teams might do a little bit better than .500 (and sleepers don't even exist anymore, because EVERYONE has already read sleepers/busts lists from a million different sources before the draft).  But we've analyzed nearly 2 decades worth of fantasy numbers from our league--  Almost everyone ends near .500, with a very small standard deviation above and below.  It's literally what'd you expect if everyone had perfect information.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's fantasy. People tend to over think and love to think they're smarter than everyone else.  We've been running our league for nearly 20 years--since high school--and one owner hasn't given a shit about baseball for about the past 9 years and has become a physician (so he literally has 0 time to do research, follow players, or teams).  He made it a point to stay in the league just to show us all how much of a waste of time it is and how you can manage to put together an amazing team just by drafting according to the top 300 list that most sites give you for free and by playing baseball PS4 video games that update regularly.  He's in first place now and will probably win our league this year. 

Yeah, spouting advanced metrics gives people the the nice cushy feeling that they're smarter than everyone else, but the problem that gets overlooked is the fact that *everyone's* strategy changes when information becomes perfect due to the internet and everyone starts doing advanced metrics.  Shit just becomes a zero sum game and randomness takes over.  All you have to do is then draft the top 300 because all of the fantasy pundits have already done the work for you.  

Moneyball and advanced metrics only worked for the As in the early 00s *because they were the only ones doing it* at that time.  The whole league caught on immediately and what have the As ever done since?  Perfect information ruins any leg up you'll have on competition no matter how many advanced stats you use because 1.) you won't be the only person in the world who'll figure it out and 2.) it'll get disseminated quickly all over fantasyland because of the internet.   </TEXT>

The only thing you have to really commit to is not giving a shit about sports. I mean I might catch a game at the local bar or something once in a while, but as I get older, I keep giving less and less shits about things like the NFL etc.  Sports are a HUGE reason your cable bills are ridiculously expensive.  

It isn't like TV is bad either.  In fact, TV produces the best entertainment that far, far exceeds the bullshit that Hollywood produces.  For example, TV gave us The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Arrested Development, The Office, GOT, The Simpsons, ....the only thing that really needs to change is distribution.  Maybe allow consumers to pay and stream per episode or something, just like how you can now buy per song instead of buying a whole album.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> These metrics are stupid.  Some states could simply be more aggressive with ticketing than others.  There is absolutely *no way in hell* that Maryland drivers are that much better than DE drivers.  NO WAY.  MD has the worst drivers I've ever, ever encountered--and that says a lot, because I've driven through NJ and outside of Philly for far too long during work commutes.  DE drivers are probably the most docile and slow driving drivers from VA all the way up to Boston.  MD is a farce of epic proportions.  Cops never enforce driving laws.  People speed 30-40 mph+ regularly over the speed limit.  People drive 65 mph on city streets in Baltimore; imagine seeing people regularly fly down Union Ave. in Wilmington doing 65.  Almost every single day I'll encounter at least 3-5 cars on the road in MD at night who drive around with their high beams on blinding everybody.  I've seen many cars simply decide to ignore red lights and blow them--and no, that's not trying to beat a light that's changing, this is almost 10 seconds after coming to a complete stop and drivers decide to simply go.  Tailgaiting and road rage are way, way off the charts in MD, but unfortunately that's something you simply can't quantify accurately.  You simply have to drive for years in these states to tell the difference.  Worst rankings in the Eastern Corridor:

1.) MD
2.) MA
3.) NJ
4.) CT
5.) NY
6.) PA
7.) VA
8.) RI
9.) DE

Lived in a lot of different places over the years, but was born and raised in DE.  DE doesn't have the worst drivers at all.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The major problem too is that many, many times in real world biology and medicine it can be flat out impossible to obtain a highly powered study.  What if you're studying a treatment for some rare disease that only 1000 people in the world have and you can only reasonably enroll 12 patients?  You might obtain a statistically significant result, but your results will be underpowered.  Other things like growing cells can take months and months of work just to get one measurement and there's absolutely no way it'd be humanly possible to obtain the 20-30 measurements you'd need for an adequately powered experiment that power of analysis says you need.  Mathematically you can talk about the flaws of biomedical research on a chalkboard, but in reality, it's much harder than doing what the mathematicians and statisticians recommend because it can inhumanly possible.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hopefully this will just be like the Wire.  A down S2, but tremendous seasons after that.  This past episode was tough.  The pacing needs to pick up.  This is almost as frustrating as when it took The Walking Dead 1000 episodes to finally get to the part where the little girl was zombified who they spent forever looking for.  Pacing.  Pacing is key.  I mean I know even a great show like Breaking Bad had filler episodes like 'fly', but it shouldn't take half a season to explain the Tyrell situation and more than 2-3 episodes for Angela to finally go through her mission.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> People have been speculating on this for a while.  Clearly E-corp is in cahoots w/ the Dark Army.  Speculation is that E-Corp and the Dark Army worked together to tank the US economy and make the banking system insolvent, and we have all sorts of evidence it worked--the deli is closing down because of a cash shortage and if you go onto mr. robot's website you can find images of cafes that say they're taking 'NO CASH' and another image of an ATM that says it has a limit for cash withdrawals.  What that means is that E Corp is now primed to become even more powerful than it ever was before 5/9 because they'll be offering E-coins as a matter of currency.  Whether or not the Dark Army was acting on the behalf of the Chinese government as a form of state sponsored hack to tank the US is a matter up for debate.  So what is fsociety's role?  The Dark Army and E-Corp needed someone to take the fall for 5/9 so they 'worked' with FSociety.  F Society got played like a fiddle and inadvertently helped E-Corp to become the most powerful entity on Earth.  


What might happen:  somehow Ray is key.  He's going to end up becoming insanely wealthy because it was hinted at that his 'merge' that Elliot was helping him with was about obtaining bitcoins.  Somehow Elliot is going to work or blackmail him into using his bitcoins and presence on the darknet to hire hitmen or whatever to kill the dark army and/or expose to the fbi the dark army/china/e-corp connection. </TEXT>

Nothing is more maddening than constantly holding out for upside and getting burned by a blow up every other game with a few teaser gems between that keep you holding on.  He was demoted because he lacks competitiveness, which is a huge red flag since so much of being a successful SP is mound presence and mental.  You can have talent, but if you don't have what it mentally takes to be a SP, well, all the talent in the world won't save you.   </TEXT>

The details that emerged during the trial are far, far more shocking than the articles in the media.  For example, in order to limit or completely avoid paying damages  to victims the Church would shift money to banks all over the world in order to make it nearly impossible to track the true worth of the diocese down and also to make it appear that it was poorer than it really was.  Some of the abuse a lot of boys suffered through are simply not even allowed to be typed on here.  You also had fucked up priests in drugs sleeping with wives of parishioners as well as children, priests giving drugs and booze to minors, ....you get the idea.  The church is probably worse than even La Casa Nostra.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a creek bed at the bottom where all of that water is flowing.  If you are swept into it you could find a car falling on top of your head 2 seconds later.  Even if you don't get swept into it, you can still get hit by a car being swept if you get trapped on something.  There's no way you can 'swim' with that kind of current strength either.  That's how people die when they panic and try to 'swim to shore' when they get swept up in the ocean by a riptide.

<TEXT> Agree with OP.  China connection may be possible, but what is probably certain is that the Dark Army and Evil corp collaborated to take down the US economy, implement E coins as the primary medium of exchange, and make E corp the most powerful entity on the planet.  

Somehow I think Ray will be key.  He wants to steal a whole bunch of bitcoins or E coins or something.   He and Elliott will partner or Elliott will steal a hhuuuuuge amount of E coins for him. Then Ray will help him to use that to fund hits on the Dark Army and Evil Corp leadership.  Ray has something to do w/ the dark web and knows how to hire hitmen.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, I agree.  I have a feeling Elliot is going to end The Dark Army somehow and someway once he knows they're working w/ Price. 

 Evil Corp has worked w/ the dark army to take down the whole economy all along, and F Society came around at the right time to allow The Dark Army to use as a pawn.  That way E Corp gets E coins as the major currency to rule the world once they tanked the economy, the Dark Army walks away insanely richer after being paid off by E Corp, and the Dark Army gets to blame F Society for the entire operation.   F Society is getting played like a fiddle. </TEXT>

Turner has quietly been one of the better bats on the LAD for this season as well as last season.  We're talking about a guy that yeah, never got a lot of playing time, but when he did, consistently put up a great batting average, OBP, and good OPS as he got older.  Could he have a Joey Bats breakout next season if he remains healthy?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you ever heard of Triborough in NYC?  'Triborough' was a name given to a loosely affiliated confederation that consisted of 4 public authorities plus the New York City Park Department and the Long Island State Commission.  In essence, 'Triborough' was the REAL entity governing NYC all thorough the reformation era of the 1920s-60s that was practically its own sovereign state.   Triborough had its own flag and seal, its own license plates, a self contained communications network, and even had its own island-Randall's--on which it administered every structure and ever piece of land.  'Triborough' literally had its own 'army'--armed "Bridge and Tunnel Officers" who guarded toll booths and revolver carrying LI Parkway Police who patrolled roads and parks--responsible to no form of city government except 'Triborough' itself.  Triborough's army was actually run by senior officers of the US Army and Navy who were retired.  Triborough had its own constitution apart from the NYC that was completely unalterable by city, state, or federal government.   Triborough was also governed by its own laws.  Most importantly, Triborough had its own source of revenue, completely free from NYC politics:  it took in all of the quarters and dimes that poured in from toll booths.

How much land did Triborough control at its peak?  It controlled all of the parks in LI and NYC, the highways and highway bordering playgrounds in the city as well as the enclaves in which power dams were placed upstate.  All of that land totaled 103,071 acres, 161 sq. miles, and an area half as large as NYC.  Just how powerful was Triborough?  At its peak, it took in as high as $213,000,000 per year in toll booth fees (Almost $2bn in today's dollars).  

You can find some information on the web about Triborough, but a lot of the very fine historical details like what's listed above I've only ever found  in a book.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mayuree Thai Tavern.  

I really can't emphasize how good their curries and noodle dishes are.  The ginger beef dish they have is also awesome.  People on Yelp like to complain about this place's portions but I have to whole heartedly disagree.  They also use higher quality ingredients.  I've been to Thailand over a dozen times and love Mayuree.  Also, if you go to Mayuree late at night on Fri. or Sat.  they have a 'secret' late night menu consisting of several different types of Thai noodle soups.  Totally awesome. Thai noodle soups are absolutely their own thing to and are much different than pho, ramen, or chinese style noodle soups.  I posted this photo of Mayuree's late night noodles over in r/food:

It's also a cool place to hangout--they have a pool table, foosball, darts, and nintendo.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Appology for poor quality photo, but I had my passenger take a photo of this light.  I can not figure out at all why there are many streets with lights like what is shown in the photo.  The street is a two way street, but it is only one lane.  So why in the world would you have a green/red light facing in YOUR direction when that light is overhanging in a lane with opposite going traffic?  Sometimes it confuses the crap out of me and I've seen many people who are from out of town inadvertently start driving in the wrong lane because of the way the lights look.  Seems like an unnecessarily dangerous thing to have.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is.  Tom Yum comes in a lot of different forms, for example, this is one of Thailand's most famous dishes and what most people think of when they think of 'tom  yum':

http://thailandbackpackershostel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tom-Yum-Goong.jpg

But they also have noodle soups with a similar style of flavoring on the street that might look like this:

http://www.beyondsustenance.com/site/2011/02/thailand-food-exploration-kuay-teow-tom-yum-sukhothai/

Basically all 'tom yum' means is a broth made from lemongrass, fish sauce, lime, and chilies.  Just like ramen or pho, there are probably a million styles/versions of tom yum  and other noodle soups in Thailand.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many scientists are NOT trained in statistics at all. I had to learn everything own my own, and even then, I'm quite sure I still don't have an expert level understanding of biostatistics.  

Yes, p values are exceeding abstract and tough to intuitively follow.  I'm all for changing the way things are done like adding descriptive statistics, using more Beysian approaches, etc.  

There are literally dozens of statistical tests to keep track of for all types of different situations, it can definitely can make your brain hurt when you need to decide which one is appropriate.  

Most biologists and medical scientists don't give a crap about descriptive statistics at all and only care about achieving that * or ** for what they're measuring and completely overlook that the size of the effect might be something like only a 5-8% change.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, you are a douche bag of epic proportions...like you know the dynamics of our relationship outside of what I've posted here.  

Obviously the problem isn't the 8 hours after I get off work and spend time with the SO--I get done what I need to do for the day and go home and spend the time that I have at home.  If you weren't so thick skulled, you'd realize the problem is when your wife wants to do something like go away to the beach during the summer for July 4th weekend, or wants to go to a family BBQ out of state that will last all day and take 4 hours to get to.  Or simply wants to get out and go hiking, camping, or something else that will take all day.  It. Can. Not. Be. Done. 

Again, if you're so smart, tell me exactly how you can stagger an experiment with 12 hour dosing intervals needed for 14 straight days.  Each time you'll also need 1.5 hours to setup, and another 1.25 hours to collect serum samples.  Tell me exactly how you'd schedule your days for 14 days straight so that you can go to the beach for a weekend, or so that you can go hiking all day at a state park.  If I come in at 3 AM, that means I still have to come in at 3 PM for 14 days.  If I come in at 9 AM I still have to be here at 9 PM....for 14 days.  If I come in  at midnight, I still have to be here at 12 PM to do everything...for 14 days straight.  Figure out how I can stagger this so we can go on a minivacation somewhere or out of town for weekend. I'm all ears.  Hell, I might even pay you to figure out how I can take a minivacation out of town for a weekend.  

It sounds like you've never done a drug study in your life before.  Next time you shouldn't assume so much.   </TEXT>

It gets super, super annoying having to argue with the spouse all of the time about this, like you know I was going to grad school before we got married and that this would take a lot of time. I'm sorry, I just can't destroy a whole experiment to go somewhere for a weekend when it took me 3 weeks to grow that many cells for it and I'd have to start all over again if I ruined the time point collections.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sugar/glycobiologist here.  

DNA and protein dominated biology in the 20th century and still dominates the headlines because humans tend to feel nice and cozy about the fact that we have discovered a 'code' that should define what we believe is life.  It has been a long time since we have discovered DNA and over a decade since we have solved the entire genome, yet genomics still can not deliver upon the revolutions that were supposed to happen in medicine that were supposed to happen according to all of the hype in the 90s.  As time has gone on, we have started to realize that life is defined not only by proteins and DNA, but also by extremely important non-template (i.e. molecules not encoded by a template like DNA) driven molecules such as the entire classes of lipids and carbohydartes/glycans.   In otherwords, there's some sort of exquisitely tuned almost 'meta-level' of biology above and beyond DNA and protein that is required for life and as you imagine, has critically important consequences for major diseases like cancer.  

Over 20 years Krebs and Fisher won the Nobel prize for their discovery that protein phosphorylation can regulate protein activity.  Almost every biologist now knows that protein physiology, in simple terms, is turned 'on/off' by phosphorylation which is performed by a kinase, and is turned 'on/off' by the complementary phosphatase. There are literally hundreds or even thousands of different kinases/phosphatases in the entire proteome.  What we discovered, however, nearly 20 years later after Fisher and Krebs was that hundreds and thousands of proteins are actually glycosylated by a special sugar known as N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).  Even more interestingly, it was discovered that GlcNAc often gets added to proteins directly at serine/threonine residues within proteins that are often the same exact sites where proteins get phosphorylated. This observation has now been dubbed O-GlcNAc.

The significance of O-GlcNacylation of proteins can not be overstated.  O-GlcNAc is basically a 'cap' on a protein's sites of phosphorylation that has to be removed before a protein can be phosphorylated--in otherwords, protein physiology is vastly more complex than Krebs and Fisher's model.  If protein X has 3 sites of phosphorylation than the number of possible ways protein X could exist if you only consider phosphorylation would be 3x2x1=6.  However if you add in the fact now that O-GlcNAc exists and caps the sites of of phosphorylation you must now include all possibly combinations of O-GlcNacylation combined with phosphorylation.  Taking the same protein with 3 phospho sites and now including O-GlcNacylation at those same sites now gives you a total number of molecular species that could theoretically exist is 84!  An exponential increase of proteo physiology just by the addition of a sugar.  

Additionally, what really, really makes O-GlcNAc neat when compared to phosphorylation is the fact that the O-GlcNAcylation of thousands of proteins is only regulated by 2 enzymes--O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) which adds GlcNAc to proteins and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) which removes it.  That's it.  Contrast that to the 1000s of different kinases/phosphatases that are needed to regulate the phosho physiology of the proteome.  

An important concept to understand, however, is how GlcNAc (the substrate of OGT) is made.  GlcNAc descends from glycolysis through what is known as the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).  The HBP is a DIRECT LINK between metabolism/nutrition/stress to gene transcription, epigenetics, and tons of cell signaling (virtually all transcription factors, TETs, RNA poly II, P53, etc. etc. are modified by O-GlcNAc).  Of course in cancer you have the Warburg effect, whereby cancer cells utilize orders of more magnitude more glucose than is normal.  As you might of guessed, this absolutely perturbs the amounts of metabolites that transverse the HBP which goes on to significantly 'mess up' O-GlcNAcylation of a whole bunch of proteins, many of which are involved in cancer apoptotic networks, cancer epigenetics, cancer metabolism, and cancer gene expression. 


We've linked the Warburg Effect and abnormal sugar consumption to almost every aspect of cancer physiology through O-GlcNAc/HBP, so let's give some important examples.  

This interesting paper describes how O-GlcNAcylation of PFK1 (the main regulatory enzyme of glycoslysis) directly controls whether or not glycolytic products will get shunted towards energy production or towards the PPP (for the production of nucleotides):

AMPK, a vital regulator of cellular energy metabolism is O-GlcNAc modified:
http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/22/1_MeetingAbstracts/614.7


Recent papers also now discuss how O-GlcNAc is pratically a 'master regulator' for all lipid biogenesis and metabolism, linking sugar/carbohydrate metabolism directly to the production or metabolism of lipids:

<TEXT> The Warburg Effect most likely doesn't exist to provide cancer cells with energy.  Warburg shunts glycolytic products into all sorts of other anabolic pathways that synthesize things like nucleotides needed for DNA/RNA synthesis, fats for membrane synthesis, and other sugars used for cell surface glycosylation---all things rapidly proliferating cells need.  I don't think the observation that gliomas can rely on fats for fuel contradicts the Warburg Effect at all. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-06-12 19:02:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The facility we have here has a Zeiss LSM780-FCS single-point, laser scanning confocal microscope.  Here is the info for the objectives:


NA 0.55 condenser with DIC for 20X, 40X, 63X and 100X lenses


Objectives:
10X/0.45 PlanApo (dry, no DIC)
20X/0.80 PlanApo (dry, no DIC)
40X/1.30 PlanNeofluar oil, with DIC
40X/1.20 C-Apo water, for FCS only
40X/1.20 C-Apo water, with DIC, upon request
63X/1.4 PlanApo oil,  with DIC
100X PlanApo oil, with DIC, upon request


The paper I'm reviewing wants to examine size differences in endosomes using this confocal setup in order to determine if non-clatharin mediated (NCM) or clatharin mediated endocytosis (CM) is occuring.  NCM endosomes are claimed to have sizes on the order of 50-80 nm while CM endosomes are on the order of 100-150 nm.  The scale bar for the confocal images is 20 um.  Can you reasonably analyze images from a setup like above for size differences on that order? I'm just wondering if that's possible, given that the scale bar is 400x larger than a 50 nm object.

If I use a coulter counter, many times I'll put '1 million'  cells in every sample, but if you look at the pellet sizes they're different.  I know cell size might change based on a treatment, so you can't just eyeball pellet sizes.  However, I also use the Countess to count cells and still can get inconsistent results that can vary wildly in some assays.  For example, I'm doing what is supposed to be a simple assay for measuring microrna from the same cell line after treating with 3 different concentrations of drug.  I use 1 million cells for every sample every single time and count, pitpette, and aspirate as carefully as I can every single time.  No matter how hard I try, I can not get reliable expression measurements of a microRNA I'm looking at from replicate to replicate for the same condition.  I have a feeling it is due in large part about the unreliableness of using cell counting to normalize sample input.  

Many literature publications use DNA or protein to normalize data to.  How reliable is this strategy?  Are these far and away better and more reliable than a simple cell count?   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Absolute values vs. relative quantity after normalizing? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-08 21:15:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm running an assay where *you are supposed* to be able to obtain absolute copy numbers of miRs per cell.  The problem I'm having is that there just seems to be so much variation between biological replicates of the assays.  Thus, if I just use absolute quantities of miRs per cell, the error bars are huge.  However, there appear to be consistent trends during each run (the same ones go down every time).  If I normalize the values in each biological replicate to the controls and then combine the normalized biological replicates, the data becomes better.  

Is this OK?  I mean it would be nice to look at absolute quantity, but I'm also looking for consistent trends.  I feel a little like I'd be falling into some sort of pitfall here.  

For example:

Day 1: miR X   has absolute values 1000, 500, and 100 for the control, treatment 1, treatment 2.  
Day 2: miR X has absolute values 10000, 5000, and 1000 for the control treatment 1, treatment 2.  

These values were also obtained after normalizing to an internal spike in control in order to control for the assay efficiency.  The same amount of cells were used every time.  So if I combine the absolute quantities, of course my variance is huge.  But if I normalize to the control, both sets have a fold change of 1, 0.5, and 0.1.   </TEXT>

What will it take to get the problem under control?  An armed robbery + murder or for the clerk to shoot down a perp?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm working with PANC-1 cells, and I've noticed that if you let them get too confluent and subsequently try to passage, the cells seemed to be transformed and start to grow like wild fire and at a rate that is exponentially greater than what is normal. For example, I can do a 1:10 or 1:20 passage and the flask will be confluent the next day.  What might have happened?  None of our other cells lines do this, and there is no evidence of contamination in any of our other lines.   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-12-04 15:01:49 </DATE>

<TEXT> I never understood why leagues use PIMs and give points for it.  Racking up PIMs does not equate to grittiness, getting penalties makes your team lose in real life.  Hits and blocked shots are much better. Not perfect by any means, but better than getting positive points for a tripping penalty that costs your team the game.  

Ah, I remember the days when a player would get a multiple penalties during a shit show of a game that would lead to a 5 minute major for fighting and a match penalty and put up more points than a player with a goal that game.   </TEXT>

I don't understand what happened.  Can New England Securities just transfer your accounts to Metlife like that?  I mean I know I did 0 investing for the past 10 years and my account funds were small (so basically they probably didn't give a crap about my account), but what's the point of paying Metlife fees if they're investing in Vanguard?  Should I just transfer again, back to Vanguard? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-10-28 23:17:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A co-worker asked if they can analyze their decelluarized matrix for contamination with EDTA and triton x-100 via HPLC.  Detecting those molecules should be straight forward, the only thing that I'm not sure about is how to go about processing the samples.  I don't see why those molecules shouldn't just be simply soluble in water (so just soak the matrices in water for a while?) OR if the problem is that triton x-100 and EDTA get trapped in the matrix.  Is there some sort of matrix digestion or hydrolysis that should be done?  The issue then is if you digest the matrix and need to use some sort of enzyme, you might need EDTA buffered solutions for that which might also contain a touch of detergent as well.  If the former method should work where we just try soak the decellularized materials in water, should we precipitate proteins out before HPLC injection?  A simple RP-C18 column should work from what I am gathering.   </TEXT>
