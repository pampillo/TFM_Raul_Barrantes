<TEXT> I haven't checked the paleogeography, but I suspect this is *not* evidence in support of an antipodal impact/volcanic hypothesis. The KT impact is in fact not antipodal to the Deccan traps: http://i.imgur.com/h8e1pJQ.jpg
___
 The Princeton model shows (at left) that the structure of the Earth's surface at the time of the meteorite impact that caused the Chicxulub crater in Mexico would have placed the Deccan Traps in India far west of the crater's antipodal point, instead of directly opposite of the impact. Correspondingly, the model shows (at right) that the meteorite struck far east of the antipodal point for the Deccan Traps, which are remnants of large volcanoes thought to have contributed to the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period. The model also revealed that the Chicxulub impact, when the Earth's surface and shape are considered, would have likely been too small to cause the Deccan Traps.

<TEXT> I haven't ruled magnetite out entirely, though I am skeptical. The colour is not like any magnetite I have ever come across - it's almost a blue grey, rather than the typical black, it's not granular and feels quite smooth, waxy to the touch, and my pen magnet doesn't 'stick' to the surface on its own (weakly magnetic rather than strongly magnetic). When there's some more light out, and I have some more free time I'll take another look. Thank you for your thoughts thus far. </TEXT>

I suspect you may mean oil (in this case bitumen)? The oil sands is [dominated](http://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/energy-statistics/canadian-crude-oil-production) by the production of bitumen which is subsequently upgraded (not refined) broadly speaking. The vast majority is [exported](http://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/energy-statistics/canadian-crude-oil-exports-imports) to the United States [PADDs](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=4890) where it is refined.

<TEXT> Came across a bit of '[float](http://imgur.com/a/mQ5wC)' at a new development. All the rock used as fill, etc. is said to be sourced from on site, and the local geology is dominated by basalt. Here the ore occurs as: massive, grey to black with a metallic luster. It is weakly magnetic (video: https://streamable.com/d2xqo) (to strongly magnetic?), and occurs with the basalt which appears to have been serpentinized. A scratch test suggests a hardness of ~5.5. I did not / do not have a streak plate; however, using the bottom of a ceramic white dish showed a dark green to brown streak. I don't believe the brown reflects the mineral in question, however, and believe it stems from small amounts of hematite that occur with it. I would be certain it was [chromite](http://geology.com/minerals/chromite.shtml) if the streak was definitively brown, however, it is not - as far as I can tell. Thoughts? </TEXT>

Up until ~12ka the Ice Free Corridor was effectively impassible due to the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets.

<TEXT> Yes, I'm aware of the ages we are discussing; however, I was simply informing you by painting a broad, generally accepted theory / timeline about something in which you clearly lack an educated understanding in.

Broadly stated, up until the Miocene the waters flowed from East to West (as was depicted in the previous comment) 

The uplift of central and northern Andes occurred concomitantly with an important reorganization of the drainage pattern in the northern South America. In Early Miocene, the fluvial systems that flowed from the Amazonian craton towards the sub-Andean basins and northward to the Caribbean were replaced by a megawetland, the Pebas system, covering more than 10^6 km^2 in western Amazonia. By Late Miocene the Pebas system progressively disappeared and gave place to the transcontinental Amazon River, connecting the Andes and the equatorial Atlantic margin.^[1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X14004075), ^[2](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n12/fig_tab/ngeo1017_F1.html)

A relatively good summary (though missing the Purus Arch which can be seen in the previous comments illustration.) has been illustrated [here](http://i.imgur.com/nHGE4o2.jpg). I hope that provides you with a clearer picture.

<TEXT> I believe the leading theory was that 'it went elsewhere.' As a part of Gondwanaland it flowed from East to West. As the Andes formed it began to change direction; however, it didn't drain into the ocean, but rather into an inland sea, and eventually forming into a freshwater lake system. More recently, with the onset of the glacial / interglacial periods (the start of the Pleistocene ~2.58Ma and the drop in sea levels, the lake system drained forming the present day Amazon river which drained from West to East (see [here](http://i.imgur.com/c33vjtq.jpg)). 

These new age estimates appear to disagree with this however. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rocks were first discovered in 2007, originally dated to ~3.7Ga, though later dating of the rocks, increasing their age to ~4.3Ga^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5897/1828), would lead to controversy... a disagreement which remains unresolved^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuvvuagittuq_Greenstone_Belt#Age_controversy)

The previous method used (leading to the much contested age) the same dating method, and was conducted by, in part, the same authors of this current paper.

Currently, the most widely accepted ages for the oldest known rocks on Earth belong to the [Acasta Gneiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acasta_Gneiss), dated to 4.03Ga^[3](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/GC/article/view/3966) </TEXT>

Still, the [Acasta Gneiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acasta_Gneiss), also located in Canada, remain the oldest, uncontested, rocks yet to be discovered. </TEXT>

They belong to the original Firestone et al. consortium^[1](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016.abstract). See my post from over three years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1f47tk/impact_12800_yeas_ago/ca6qy7w/

EDIT:

In summary:

(1) Nanodiamonds do not require an impact hypothesis for their formation. The so-called nanodiamonds, aren't actually nanodiamonds^[2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.2892/abstract;jsessionid=51A787DCE92D9C69E34E89E21AD85D2E.f02t02)

(2) Their samples are not from the same stratigraphical layer^[3](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/21/E2162), ^[4](http://www.nature.com/news/prehistoric-impact-idea-smacked-down-1.15194)

(3) There's no evidence of wide spread fires via impact^[5](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.2914/abstract)

(4) Suggested Iridium anomoly is not a result of comet impact, but rather from common wetland processes^[6](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/19/7208) 

(5) Black-mats result from changes in the water table, not from an impact event^[7](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/18/6520.full#sec-11)

(6) The Clovis culture was not 'wiped out'^[8](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440310001731)

(7) 
In summary, none of the original YD impact signatures have been subsequently corroborated by independent tests. Of the 12 original lines of evidence, seven have so far proven to be non-reproducible. The remaining signatures instead seem to represent either (1) non-catastrophic mechanisms, and/or (2) terrestrial rather than extraterrestrial or impact-related sources. In all of these cases, sparse but ubiquitous materials seem to have been misreported and misinterpreted as singular peaks at the onset of the YD. Throughout the arc of this hypothesis, recognized and expected impact markers were not found, leading to proposed YD impactors and impact processes that were novel, self-contradictory, rapidly changing, and sometimes defying the laws of physics. The YD impact hypothesis provides a cautionary tale for researchers, the scientific community, the press, and the broader public.^[9](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825211000262)

<TEXT> Every kimberlite diamondiferous deposit consists of various sized diamonds. Microdiamonds are by far the most abundant, and further drilling is required to estimate the fraction of larger diamonds. If you don't have microdiamonds, you're simply not going to have any macrodiamonds. 

With regard to diamondiferous kimberlite, exploration requires that you first find KIMs (Kimberlite Indicator Minerals) which indicate the presence of kimberlite (a unique magma that transports diamonds from depth to the surface). KIMs are a set of minerals that are rather unique to kimberlitic magmas: chromium diopside, chromium spinels, magnesian ilmenite, and chromium rich pyrope garnets. 

Once you locate the mineral train full of KIMs you trace it to its source. Generally speaking it is rare to find microdiamonds within the mineral train. Once you have located the source of the KIMs (the kimberlite pipe / dyke) you can sample it in hopes of finding microdiamonds which would suggest that there may exist macros as well. You would then conduct more drilling and bulk sampling to determine the fraction of macrodiamonds present. 

Furthermore, generally kimberlite pipes occur in clusters. If you have located one, there is a good chance that more can be discovered within the region. Hope that helps bring some perspective to the article, and the significance of finding microdiamonds. </TEXT>

Admittedly, I haven't read the study at length, however, I'm not sure I follow that interpretation. IIRC previous studies have shown that while some percentage of H2O, derived from comets, may have contributed to Earths  oceans, comets could not have supplied the majority. Other than mass calculations, strong evidence suggests that Earth's water was here all along^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/795) (as the article states), with contributions from chondritic bodies suggested by D/H composition^[2](http://i.imgur.com/Swz01Mr.jpg), ^[3](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/623) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is room for debate in regard to the effects on Earth and microbial life from the LHB, with some research concluding that there exists "no plausible situation in which the habitable zone was fully sterilized on Earth"^[1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7245/abs/nature08015.html) .  The upshot is that this also implies a submarine zone which remained habitable, in agreement with submarine hydrothermal vent origins (black smokers), and others such as the Lost City hydrothermal field^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_City_Hydrothermal_Field) .

Another interesting point regarding the Faint Young Sun must also be emphasized. The Earth's atmosphic composition lacked any significant amount of oxygen, and thus lacked an ozone layer; in other words, life would have been bathed in radiation, and again submarine environments would have provided a habitable zone. There are polyextremophile bacteria ([Deinococcus radiodurans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans)) able to withstand an acute does of ionizing radiation upwards of 500,000 rad, but supposedly([?](http://www.astrobio.net/origin-and-evolution-of-life/could-natural-nuclear-reactors-have-boosted-life-on-this-and-other-planets/)) there is no evolutionary reason to develop such high tolerances.

While interesting to think about, I tend not to give much weight to such thoughts (adding unnecessary complexity where none may be needed). If life can readily emerge during the Hadean / Eoarchean on Earth, the implication suggests life could also arise elsewhere. Arguing towards panspermia, to me, tends to diminish the value, and importance of having multiple points of origin in the search for life. If we are to think along panspermia though, perhaps it's best to regard Earth as the original source?    </TEXT>

Evidence of isotopically light carbon provides strong evidence in support of such arguments, seeing as modern day analogs (micro tubular textures) are structurally identical ([modern](http://i.imgur.com/PTOXhx4.jpg) compared to [~3.5Ga fossils](http://i.imgur.com/D3Gbd5V.jpg)).

<TEXT> The article does a poor job of explaining why I should be convinced of the studies conclusion. 

What lead the authors to confidently conclude that the local, single site analysis of Clay:Calcium are a *confirmed* result of a chaotic resonance transition associated with interactions between the orbits of Mars and the Earth?

Without reading the paper at length (the abstract is certainly no help), I can only assume there are a plethora of non-astronomical possibilities that may have contributed to the ratios discussed... it's a rather bold leap to make. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and so far I have not been privy to such evidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure why you're being downvoted.

Because it's not factual. Waste water injection and hydraulic fracturing have both been linked to induced seismicity. Whether or not the seismicity is a result of waste water injection or hydraulic fracturing depends on a number factors, however, the underlying geology seems to be the dominant component.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as temperatures between the surface of the Sun and Earth's inner core go, no that's not surprising. What's surprising is the body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure at these P-T conditions. As the abastract states:

The two leading candidates are hexagonal close-packed [hcp] and body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal structures, but the dynamic and thermodynamic stability of bcc iron under inner-core conditions has been challenged.

Note the following phase diagram ([here](http://i.imgur.com/h5Qsyzy.png))^[1](http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/news_publications/press_release/2010/101015/) which depicts hcp and note where on the phase diagram bcc is found.

I've modified the above diagram to highlight P-T conditions (330GPa - 360GPa and 5300C - 6000C respectively) within the Earth's inner core: http://i.imgur.com/o0BaqRN.jpg </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are correct in that geophysical models, and any mathematical model for that matter, contains the problem of non-uniqueness. That is to say, any number of modeled variables may be able to fit the data; however, you must obey geochemical and geophysical constraints at any set of P-T conditions and produce the most probable solution. In doing so we can arrive at an acceptable interpretation, as in fact, the study does:

"Analysis of the seismic signature reveals that the compositional heterogeneity can be ascribed to a small volume of partial melt (0.5  0.2 vol% on average)... Despite spatial variations in temperature, the calculated melt volume fraction correlates strongly with the amplitude of PS conversion throughout the region. Comparing the values of temperature calculated from the seismic signal with available petrological constraints, we infer that melting in the layer is caused by release of volatiles from the subducted Farallon slab."

Provided your extensive background in geology, what would you propose other than a volatile rich melt fraction from the subducted Farallon slab capable of producing such an anomaly?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A number of comments have stated the problem is effectively heat and pressure. I'd just like to add some rough values to further elucidate on those comments. Earth's geothermal gradient is ~25C per kilometer of depth, and Earth's pressure gradient is ~30MPa per kilometer of depth (1MPa = 296.077atm, where 1atm is equal to the weight of the atmosphere at sea level). Therefore, at 350km depth temperatures could easily reach 8,750C with pressures equaling 10,500MPa (103,626.94atm).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Viscosity primarily relates to the silica content of the magma, the higher the silica content the more viscous the magma, although temperature and gas content also play a role. The greater the silica content the more bonding of [silica tetrahedra](http://i.imgur.com/EBsMSFT.jpg), and therefore the greater the degree of polymerization (ie. the greater the viscosity of the magma).

<TEXT> So I only had time to look one of the photos you provided and mark it up for you (so I chose the easier one). Solid red lines I am confident those are dumlins (I've marked ice flow direction on them). It's not uncommon for them the have a small basin in front of them (note the small pond for example). Dashed lines I am less confident without seeing them in 3D. Blue lines encircle what could be kames / hummocks and yellow indicate what I believe may be eskers (can't be confident in those though): http://i.imgur.com/pFW2tmr.jpg There are a number of other glacial landforms that I left unmarked simply because it was not clear what they could be given the resolution.

Here's an [ice flow indicator map](http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/Mining/Geoscience/PublicationsCatalogue/OpenFiles/2013/Documents/2013-06/OF2013_06_Sheet1.pdf) for BC (large pdf). </TEXT>

<TEXT> What area are you referring to (google map)? Are they mostly till, or bedrock? It can be difficult to assess without real world context. If the region has seen several glacial-interglacial episodes complex landforms may arise as latter flow regimes may modify previous landforms.

From what you're describing, these could range from pods of whalebacks, drumlin swarms, roche moutonnes, flutes, crag and tails, rogen moraines, hummocky terrain, etc.

Generally speaking, they are relatively short-lived^[1](https://qz.com/903913/lava-from-a-hawaiian-volcano-continues-to-flow-like-an-unstoppable-firehose-into-the-pacific-ocean/)

Is the lava in the flow typically of deep Earth origin, or more shallower slight sub-surface melting?

This is an area of active debate with generally two camps. One favours a deep mantle plume sourced from the core-mantle boundary, while the other favours a shallower thermal anomaly.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Water is a volatile so that is why you get the explosive reaction

I don't believe that's entirely true, or in the very least I think it can be explained more correctly as it sounds like you're refering to oceanic water. The oceanic water flashes to steam but that's not where the explosiveness comes from. Magma contains volatiles which exsolve at lower pressures such as at the surface. Here, as the volatiles are in the process of exsolution the lava is quenched by the relatively cold oceanic water. Quenching the lava as the gases are rapidly exsolving generates the explosion. The concentration of gases is not homogeneous (it's heterogeneous) and therefore you get periods of increased explosivity relative to other periods.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, dark colours will simply look like shadows, outcrop, or ground litter. It's best to wear bright colours that are not typically found in nature as they stand out like a sore thumb. Fluorescent orange for example (ie. street cones), amongst others. 

I do mineral exploration as a field geologist and the worst thing you can wear, so as to be near invisible from the air, are dark colours.

<TEXT> The Canadian Rockies are composed of layer upon layer of [sedimentary rocks](http://i.imgur.com/F0cvLbp.jpg) (sandstone, shales, limestone) that were deposited billions of years ago. It's a long a complex story but to summarize... skipping ahead hundreds of millions of years... as the super continent [Pangea](http://i.imgur.com/VoKXjIt.jpg) rifted apart, the west coast of ancestral North America accreted numerous allochthonous (found in a place other than where they and their constituents were formed) volcanic islands, etc (much like a snow as it builds up in front of a shovel). It wasn't until Vancouver Island, etc., (part of a terrane known as Wrangellia - labelled 'W' in the following graphic) were accreted that the Canadian Rockies were pushed up from the beneath the water. [Here](http://plate-tectonic.narod.ru/terranesswamer1photoalbum.html) is the graphic. Search for "Where Terranes Collide: The Geology of Western Canada" for an older, yet good introduction to the topic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is much speculation due to the large degree of uncertainty, however, there are some major themes that are generally accepted. Solar luminosity would have been lower^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_young_Sun_paradox) , and the oceans would have been shallower, with lower bathymetry, as a result of a higher heat flow, and therefore eruptive composition of lavas leaning more favourably towards a Komatiite composition (very low silica content). There is evidence to suggest that prior to the dominance of  chlorophyll-based organisms, retinal-based photosynthesis may have dominated resulting in purple oceans^[2](http://www.astrobio.net/biosphere/did-earth-have-purple-oceans/) . 

Though there are newer editions, I highly recommend the following, free, text book, [Earth as an Evolving Planetary System](http://wzanews.com/IMG2/book/general%20geology/11.pdf) (pdf) which may provide you with the detailed answers you are looking for. </TEXT>

It's not Jadeite either as it a) lacks the sugary texture you see in Jadeite b) Jadeite does not change colour c) A piece of Jadeite that consistent in colour, that transparent, etc. would be worth millions d) That specific [pink and blue](https://www.gia.edu/gia-faq-jade-pink-blue) are not typical [colors of Jadeite](http://masonkay.com/colors-of-jade)

<TEXT> Not really, but kind of. In most cases there are definitely tell tale signs that an eruption is likely as magma begins to ascend. Movement of magma will generate detectable earthquakes ([harmonic tremors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_tremor)), the ground may deform, thermal anomalies may form, and changes in the temperature and chemistry of the groundwater and spring waters may appear. 

As far as timing older events, there are a number of methods to date individual lava flows. While there are certainly exceptions, and uncertainties, I wouldn't go so far as to say we 'don't know shit about timing.' </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I'm aware, the oldest DNA recorded was found in Greenland ice, estimated to be between 450,000ka - 800,000ka. 

Diminishing returns

By comparing the specimens' ages and degrees of DNA degradation, the researchers calculated that DNA has a half-life of 521 years. That means that after 521 years, half of the bonds between nucleotides in the backbone of a sample would have broken; after another 521 years half of the remaining bonds would have gone; and so on.

The team predicts that even in a bone at an ideal preservation temperature of 5 C, effectively every bond would be destroyed after a maximum of 6.8 million years. The DNA would cease to be readable much earlier  perhaps after roughly 1.5 million years, when the remaining strands would be too short to give meaningful information.

\- [Genetic material can't be recovered from dinosaurs](http://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11555)

As far as soft tissue preservation, structure and texture can certainly be preserved depending on environmental conditions for a considerable length of time. For example, the soft tissue preservation of Precambrian ([540Ma](http://www.geomore.com/wp-content/uploads/GEOLOGIC-TIME-SCALE-COURTESY-GSA.jpg)) organisms: [Exceptional preservation of soft-bodied Ediacara Biota promoted by silica-rich oceans](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2016/10/03/G38542.1.abstract) </TEXT>

Unfortunately, there is simply too much information for me to even being explaining, however, it's fairly intuitive / user friendly.
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/bYIL0Jy.jpg) the terrane box is situated on Wells Gray Peak, I've simply selected the External Provider (located to the right of the Legend box) as Google Hybrid and selected from within the legend box Geology -- terrane transparent as well as faults, and bedrock geology -- bedrock labels

You can play around with a lot. In the following example I've simply zoomed in, switched the External Provider to Google Physical, and turned on the Geology, Bedrock transparent along with the labels. Simply hovering with 'pan' hand over the region of interest brings up the specific details of each as shown [here](http://i.imgur.com/hnRf77H.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/EqFSjyi.jpg).

You can turn on all sorts of minfile data / reports, regional geochemistry samples (RGS), showings, past producers, productive mines, the list goes on and on. Have fun! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In truth, the picture isn't so clear cut. *Generally* speaking, while the amount of volatiles present in a magma are what drive explosive eruptions, it's the viscosity of the magma, that determines whether an eruption will be explosive or not. At low-viscosities (think basalt ~50% SiO2) the gases are able to migrate through the magma and escape to the surface. However, in more viscous magmas (think rhyolite ~70% SiO2), the high polymerization acts to impede the migration of the gases, resulting in increased pressures subsequently leading to explosive volcanism. 

Exceptions, for example, could be a silica rich magma that degassed which would result in an obsidian flows, or a basaltic magma coming into contact with ground water (see: [phreatomagmatic eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff_cone)) </TEXT>

<TEXT> *about* 81%

The author, [Steven M. Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_M._Stanley), presents some convincing arguments within the paper, and while I disagree with some of his assumptions I don't think they're unreasonable. The value of ~81% is arrived at through the use of a genus-level rarefaction curve for species losses in major mass extinctions and then "shifted downward by 4 percentage points, to 80.581.5% (dashed line), to account for clustering of extinctions within certain taxa" [figure 5](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/28/1613094113/F5.expansion.html)

He notes how previous authors (Raup, and Sepkoski) recognize that some of their analysis could be considered dubious, and discusses how their results would have artificially elevated values by erroneously combining two separate events as one (combining data for the Guadalupian and terminal Permian crises). Given that Raup's actual estimates were reported as 8896% (often rounded to 9095%) and considering the aforementioned, 80.5-81.5% certainly seems reasonable.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of comments disregarding glacial links; however, that doesn't mean that glacial activity did not contribute to its present day formation. Immediately to the left there appears to be what could have easily have been a cirque glacier. Like rivers and streams, alpine glaciers don't forge their own paths, they follow topographical lows along faults, basins, etc. 

I would argue that while the initial feature is likely structurally related (fault, fracture, eroded dyke - note its orientation parallels other structural features, etc) that glacial activity has played a significant role in the past. The region has been exposed to extensive glaciation through several glacial-interglacial events via the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (note the rounded top - an indicator that glaciers may have once topped this mountain). </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the most part I think we are on the same page, however, our definitions may be what are leading to our hair splitting. 

Yes you need a path for the magma, but no you don't necessarily need to form faults prior to magma ascent and independently to the location where this magma is ascending (otherwise, the Emperor seamounts would have had a hard time to be formed).

Magma ascent through mantle upwelling does not need faults (obviously), however, once the magma reaches shallow depths, without some form of tectonism (deformation of the crust) it cannot continue to ascend. At deeper depths, stoping may occur, and as the crust warms it will deform through extensional faults, fractures or fissure (all forms of tectonism) which permit doming / bulging of the crust in order to accommodate the underlying magma. Thus far, there has been no volcanism. Over pressure may fracture the rock within the crust leading to magma injection and the formation of feeder dykes eventually permitting it to reach the surface ([this applies to hot spot volcanism^[1](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n8/images/ngeo1878-f3.jpg), arc volcanoes^[2](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/41/7/767/F1.large.jpg) etc.]). Once it reaches the surface (or is very near the surface) it is volcanism. 

Now that volcanism has been generated, through a generalized sequence (tidal heating - upwelling - tectonism - volcanism) crustal loading can generate new stress regimes and bukling, overprinting the previous events and leading to orientations that are regional rather than global. As I stated previously, part of the reason I didn't wish to go into much detail is due to the non-unique nature of the problem. Until you can bring me a seismic survey and some core samples there a plethora of non-unique solutions that are all plausible explanations as is clearly stated in the introduction of "[GLOBAL LINEATIONS AND REGIONAL STRUCTURAL  MAPPING  OF  IOS PATERAE AND MOUNTAINS: IMPLICATIONS FOR CRUSTAL STRESSES AND FEATURE EVOLUTION](http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2016/pdf/2355.pdf)" (2016) (pdf).

My initial point concerning Io, however, was that you cannot have volcanism without some form of tectonism preceding it, after which you can have all the crustal loading you want to give rise to further volcanism. Given the above (an attempt at clarifying definitions), is this point still disputed? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I guess different labs have different definitions of what tectonic activity is... It's not that important, though.

a) No they don't, it's well defined. Again, you can have tectonic activity without plate tectonics, but you cannot have plate tectonics without tectonism.

b) It's actually very important so that we're at least on the same page and not talking past one another. You don't get to brush its importance aside because you were shown to be, very clearly, incorrect.


As for Io, I relented even discussing the topic because so little material is available, often done by a handful of researchers, and can be contradictory (it's also based on very limited data sets). That being said...

You're unnecessary smarmy attitude doesn't get you a free pass around the basics of a first year geology either. Volcanism does not occur, cannot occur, unless there is a pathway for the magma to ascend - there's no arguing that, it's a simple physical constraint (or in your own words, "that's basic logic"). So I would again state what I previously stated noting that nothing you have presented contradicts the following, or my previous comment:

Io's crustal tides, driven by tidal heating, result in tectonic activity which then provide pathways (faults) along which magma can travel, subsequently reaching the surface leading to volcanism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's incorrect, tectonics is about how the crust deforms whether or not that includes plate tectonics or not. In other words you can have tectonic activity without plate tectonics, but you cannot have plate tectonics without tectonism. You cannot have wrinkle ridges, fault scarps, and many other landforms without tectonism; however, you can clearly have them without plate tectonics as is noted by features on Ceres, Mercury, our Moon, etc.

As per the [Lunar and Planetary Institute](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/explore/shaping_the_planets/tectonism.shtml):

**Are there tectonics on other planets?**
Like Earth, Venus and Mars are believed to have hot interiors. This means that they are continuing to lose heat. While their surfaces show evidence of recent deformation  tectonism  neither planet has plate tectonic activity because neither planet has a surface divided into plates.

Io's internal heat is driven by tidal heating, however, its volcanism is a result of tectonism (volcanism is a form of tectonic activity?), much like the volcanism in Earth's East African Rift. As [Turtle et al](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JE001354/abstract;jsessionid=CBB4116C00C6EE9E41956AD476800C31.f03t04) argue:

The large fraction (40%) of mountains that are associated with paterae suggests that in some cases these features are tectonically related.

An example illustrating this is also within [Io after Galileo](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0034-4885/68/2/R02) which states the following:

the relationship between mountains and paterae... indicates that many paterae are formed as magma preferentially ascends along tectonic faults associated with mountain building. [see figure 'a'](http://cdn.iopscience.com/images/0034-4885/68/2/R02/Full/rpp164819fig08.jpg).

Io's crustal tides, driven by tidal heating, result in tectonic activity which then provide pathways (faults) along which magma can travel, subsequently reaching the surface leading to volcanism.

<TEXT> I can't actually comment on variability between batches as this is my first taste of anything Aberlour. I've wanted to venture more towards the other side of the spectrum away from the more typical Islay's (smoke and peat) to the more fruit and sherry bottlings. After a bit of research I opted for Aberlour's A'bunadh and have no regrets in doing so. 

As for speculating between batches I would suspect that some degree of variation is likely to exist, but that there would not be enough to dissuade one from purchasing a bottle no matter the batch. Had the A'bunadh been more complex I could easily see myself rating it in 90's. The lowest I would rate it would likely be 87, however, the finish was simply too good not to pull the score up by a point (I had initially rated it at 88). All that being said, I can't see anyone rating it below 85 no matter the batch, and as far as I'm concerned anything over 85 is easily worth exploring.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I was trying to recall who's argument it was but couldn't. It was, as you have suggested, Kemp et al. (certainly not mine, I'm simply reiterating from past lecture material that managed to stick). Very insightful points of discussion. Given your knowledge, I suspect you have far more than an undergraduate degree. May I ask what your area of focus is in?

If temperatures were similar enough to modern values (roughly speaking) does this not imply a setting that would promote plate tectonics much like our modern plate tectonics? If not, why not? This doesn't appear to be the case however with some studies suggesting drip tectonics, etc. and the onset of modern plate tectonics around [~3.0Ga](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v8/n7/fig_tab/ngeo2466_F4.html).

<TEXT> Thanks for the update, I was unaware of the analytical artifact. It's been a while but I recalled parts of this debate from one of my courses during my undergraduate degree. 

Also the oxygen isotope data from the Hadean zircons cannot be used to infer a granitic crust, only that there was liquid water.

Wasn't that exactly what Wilde et al. did in their paper, "[Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4Gyr ago](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6817/full/409175a0.html)" though somewhat indirectly... 

"*We found that the zircon is zoned with respect to rare earth elements and oxygen isotope ratios (18O values from 7.4 to 5.0), indicating that it formed from an evolving magmatic source. The evolved chemistry, high 18O value and micro-inclusions of SiO2 are consistent with growth from a granitic melt,  with a 18O value from 8.5 to 9.5.*"

Although the 18O values are assumed to be weathered at low temperatures, forming clays that are later melted to produce granite which crystallizes minerals with high 18O, another mechanism is possible that produces these values without low surface temperatures. 

Early basaltic crust weathered under a CO2-rich atmosphere would produce carbonate minerals and clays. The weathering occurs at 100-200C (cooling as CO2 drawn-down into carbonate minerals) forming carbonate minerals with high 18O. Subsequently these altered basalts are melted by further basaltic intrusions and radiogenic heating to produce dioritic intrusions
which crystallizes minerals (including zircon) with high 18O.

Hf perhaps isn't the best indicator either for continental crust as the Earth and Moon share very similar Hf values with the obvious note that the Moon has no continental crust nor plate tectonics.

As far as I'm aware it is possible that Hadean detrital zircons record Earth having settled down to a modern like planet (plate tectonics, low T oceans) by 4.4 Ga; however, it is equally possible that Hadean detrital zircons record the draw-down of a massive greenhouse atmosphere, a stagnant lid lithosphere (and deep mantle melting because the mantle was hotter) and a largely
basalt crust that locally was remelted due to high radiogenic heat production and contact
metamorphism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would be hesitant to accept delta O-18 values in zircons as support for a felsic crust or the presence of liquid water. Because there can be multiple mechanisms for creating the same isotopic values we cannot rely solely on a single line of evidence. For example lunar zircons have been shown to have similar heavy oxygen isotope compositions as those of Earth. Providing our understanding that the Moon has had neither liquid water or felsic crust, the evidence in support of these features on Earth becomes far less certain, and clearly other mechanisms can be responsible for elevated delta O-18 values in zircons.

This implies that there is no support for the presence of an ocean on the surface of the early Earth and as the ocean appears to be an essential ingredient for the plate tectonics, there is no basis for belief that this mechanism was operating in the early history of the planet. -[NASA](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20080030961) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Under the assumption that the early solar system was habitable there is absolutely no reason to invoke *panspermia*. There is good fossil evidence for life as early as 3.5Ga, and potentially earlier as this study ([and others](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/life-on-earth-likely-started-at-least-4-1-billion-years-ago-much-earlier-than-scientists-had-thought)) suggests that are in good agreement with [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis). 

The point is that if life is capable of evolving in an early inner habitable solar system then you don't need a delivery method because it's already there to begin with. On the other hand, if the early inner solar system was not habitable I could see at least some *small* reason to suggest panspermia may have played a role; however, the vast majority of evidence simply does not support the latter.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fail to see how the *potential*\* discovery of 3.7Ga microbial fossils further supports panspermia. It seems like an unnecessary leap altogether, only complicating the picture (Occam's razor). Rather than invoking the complexities of panspermia, why not simply suggest that the early solar system was likely habitable (ie. Earth, Mars, Venus)?


"Nutman and his colleagues urge great caution and skepticism. "The problem is that structures that look similar to stromatolites can form without the action of living organisms," Allwood writes, and within today's fossils "there are no organic or cellular remains." 

And for good reason. His previous findings along similar lines (dating back to [1996](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v384/n6604/abs/384055a0.html)) have not yet been convincing enough to be accepted. </TEXT>

Body: Full bodied, rich and soft

Nose: Fruity - Green apples and peach, campfire smoke, peat, and a hint of vanilla in the distance

Palate: A burst of honeyed fruits with citrus: lemons, oranges, and peaches. Tobacco smoke and pepper begin to emerge.  

Finish: Lingering flavours of tobacco and sweetness with a bite of pepper. 

Score: 88/100

Notes: Matured in refill European and American oak casks, with an ABV of 48% (compared to 43% for the
16 year old) this celebratory scotch and tribute to Alfred Bernard's visit to the distillery is beautifully balanced.
A fitting tribute indeed, and well worth experiencing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it isn't farmed, it's mined. While this is considered by some to be a diverse ecosystem that shouldn't prevent its potential exploitation, however, what *should* prevent its potential exploitation is whether or not the system can undergo reclamation. In other words, is the ecosystem capable of returning to normal under a relatively short interval of time once operations are completed. This is essentially the purpose behind this study:

In addition to this, the ISA has stipulated that prior to exploitation, a benthic biological baseline study must be undertaken for each exploration contract area.

Unfortunately, our knowledge of marine ecosystems is fairly poor to say the least when it comes to abyssal habitats, and it has taken the potential for resource extraction to motivate progress in this regard:

No megafaunal studies had been undertaken in the UK-1 contract area prior to licensing in 2013... 

Interestingly previous studies have suggested that these systems are fully capable of recovering:

In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000 meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. ... the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the watersediment interface has fully recovered.

<TEXT>  How do geologists know when it's time to evacuate?

Geologists monitor volcanic activity using numerous methods. Note, however, that while we can say whether or not an eruption is likely, we cannot say with 100% certainty that an eruption will (or in some cases will not) occur. The best indicators are signs of increasing activity well above what are considered to be normal or background levels of activity. Sampling the composition, and concentration of gases and water, observing changes in topography using GPS and LiDAR as the ground deforms, observing changes in temperature using thermal imaging techniques, and most commonly watching for increased activity on seismic networks, looking for seismic swarms, harmonic tremors and in general - a substantial increase above background levels. However, *some* volcanoes are known for erupting without any warning. That is without seismic activity such as the more recent eruption of [Pavlof Volcano](http://www.ktva.com/why-did-pavlof-volcano-erupt-with-almost-no-seismic-warning-609/) along the Alaskan Peninsula. Certain types of eruptions may also lack warning signs, such as the 2014 phreatic eruption of [Mount Ontake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Mount_Ontake_eruption) in Japan. The devices in place (monitoring the volcano where 12 seismometers, 5 GPS stations and 1 tiltmeter) showed no surface deformation and no clear indicators of increased seismicity.

<TEXT> There is simply no way we can [tell] these events from events that predict a super eruption.

Current activity within the Yellowstone Volcanic Field is not at all suggestive of an imminent eruption, let alone a super-eruption. Intense precursory activity (far exceeding background levels) at multiple spots within the Yellowstone Volcanic Field would indicate an eruption *may* be imminent; however, the small earthquakes, ground uplift and subsidence, and gas releases at Yellowstone are commonplace events and do not reflect impending eruptions - as is normal for any active volcanic field. 

Geysers spring up or stop working...

That's how hydrothermal systems operate. Fluids are transported along fluid pathways (open space filling) where mineral deposition occurs. Continued mineral deposition will eventually seal off the fluid pathway (hydrostatic pressure  lithostatic pressure). This causes pressure to subsequently build until it fractures the rock (hydrostatic pressure  lithostatic pressure) allowing fluids to be transported again, and the process repeats (this is similar to how the banding in agates is formed through several fluid pulses). 

the[re] are earthquakes all the time...

They are small and discrete, and to be expected in an active volcanic field. Suspicions would likely arise should they be sustained ([harmonic tremors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_tremor)). Earthquakes are also another means of sealing off fluid pathways until pressure fractures the rock permitting fluids to flow again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As per the [Yellowstone FAQ](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/volcanoqa.htm):

Q: Will the Yellowstone volcano erupt soon?

A: Current geologic activity at Yellowstone has remained relatively constant since scientists first started monitoring more than 30 years ago. Another caldera-forming eruption is theoretically possible, but it is very unlikely in the next thousand or even 10,000 years. Scientists have also found no indication of an imminent smaller eruption of lava.

...

Q: How do scientists know the Yellowstone volcano won't erupt?

A: Scientists from the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO) watch an array of monitors in place throughout the region. These monitors would detect sudden or strong movements or shifts in heat that would indicate increasing activity. No such evidence exists at this time.

As per the article:

According to Gualda, the decompression period would likely be accompanied by the expansion of the magma body which should have detectable effects on the Earths surface.

'Listening' to the distinctive tell tale signs of magma as it moves through the Earth's crust with the use of seismometers; watching surface deformation (mapping changes in topography) with GPS   LiDAR; and sampling gases from fumaroles for changes in composition are all currently methods used to detect and monitor volcanic activity, amongst others: http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/yellowstone_monitoring_47.html </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's an interesting paper, but it does seem to be pulling at straws in a number of areas. When the question of timing arises, the soft sediment deformation structures do not correlate with the formation of the Manicouagan Crater (a discrepancy of ~14 million years). 

The Manicouagan impact crater, 100 km in diameter and 2000 km from the UK in late Triassic palaeogeographic reconstructions (Fig. 7), might be considered a candidate but for its significantly earlier date of 214 Ma ago (Hodych and Dunning, 1992) against 200 Ma ago for the Lilstock Formation (Plfy et al., 2000; Hesselbo et al., 2002). Further, indirect, evidence for this age mismatch comes from soft-sediment deformation in the late Triassic (early Norian) Blomidon Formation of Nova Scotia (Fig. 7)(Ackermann et al.,1995; Tanner, 2002), 700 km to the north of the impact, and an horizon of microtektites and shocked quartz, dated to 214Ma ago, within the Mercia Mudstone Group of southern England (Fig. 7)(Walkden et al., 2002).

As per the discussion:

...no impact crater of the right age has yet been located and other evidence in support of a bolide impact remains inconclusive. The work of Cohen and Coe (2002) even suggests that a major impact was unlikely at this time. The impact of a
km-scale asteroid does provide a plausible explanation for the observed sedimentological effects in the Cotham Member across the UK, but the evidence is far from unequivocal. Even if ultimately confirmed as the cause, current evidence does not indicate it as a significant contributory factor in the generation of either the isotope excursion or the biotic changes through the TriassicJurassic boundary interval.

<TEXT> It refers to the hydroxl group (OH^- ) contained within the mineral. A 'wet' magma or melt contains minerals that contain water in the form of a hydroxl group, and other volatiles. For example, basalt (olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase) is dry, where as andesite (plagioclase, pyroxene / hornblende and accessory minerals such as biotite) and granite are wet.
___

Basalt's primary composition consists of

Olivine: (Mg,Fe)2SiO4

Pyroxene: XY(Si,Al)2O6 *where X represents Ca, Na, Fe^+2 and Mg and more rarely Zn, Mn and Li and Y represents ions of smaller size, such as Cr, Al, Fe^+3, Mg, Co, Mn, Sc, Ti, Va and even Fe^+2*

Plagioclase Feldspar: NaAlSi3O8  CaAl2Si2O8

Notice how there were no OH groups present in any of those minerals? Now let's look at Granite.
___

Granite:

Potassium feldspar:  KAlSi3O8 or (K,Na)(Si,Al)4O8

Plagioclase Feldspar: NaAlSi3O8  CaAl2Si2O8

Quartz: SiO2

Muscovite:  KAl2(AlSi3O10)(F,**OH**)2, or (KF)2(Al2O3)3(SiO2)6(**H2O**)

Biotite: K(Mg,Fe)3(AlSi3O10)(F,**OH**)2

Hornblende-type amphiboles: Ca2(Mg, Fe, Al)5(Al,Si)8O22(**OH**)2
___

Should ascending magma come into contact with groundwater an eruption [would likely occur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreatomagmatic_eruption). 

Because these 'wet' minerals are stable at depth, they will destabilize as the magma ascends releasing their volatiles. In essence the magma produces its own water, known as [magmatic water or juvenile water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magmatic_water) as opposed to meteoric water which is derived from precipitation (snow and rain) and recharges aquifers.

A more specific use of the term can be found in John D. Winter's Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology text:

A fluid-saturated melt is one that contains the maximum amount of a dissolved volatile species possible under the existing P-T-X conditions. Any volatiles present in excess of that amount must be present as a separate coexisting fluid phase. The term fluid pressure (Pf) is commonly used to describe the combined effect of pressure and fluid content in fluid-bearing systems. A melt system at a specific pressure can vary from fluid saturated (Pf = Ptotal) to fluid free (Pf = 0, also called dry), depending on the amount of fluid species available. Pf rarely exceeds Ptotal, at least not for long, because the result would be expulsion of the excess volatiles, often explosively. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Groundwater is relatively shallow, and any magma to come into contact with the aquifer would, result in a phreatomagmatic eruption, if not in the very least a phreatic eruption prior to contact with the magma.

Wet and dry magma's are nomenclature used to describe the abundance of 'wet' minerals such amphiboles, and micas. For example, basalt (olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase) is dry, where as andesite (plagioclase, pyroxene / hornblende and accessory minerals such as biotite) is wet. </TEXT>

Body: Full bodied, smooth and waxy

Nose: Orange citrus, sherry, burnt sticks, and peat. 

Palate: A dry sweet arrival, cinnamon sticks, clove spice, cooked fruit, and orange marmalade all enveloped in mild cigar smoke

Finish: Subtle smoke, medium length and smooth

Score: 85/100

Notes: While not overly complex, it strikes a fine balance in flavours. No single flavour is overly strong and no single flavour over powers the other, and for this reason may be a good introductory scotch for those looking to venture towards smoke and peat, as it was for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. Any number of techniques are often combined to cross check one another between various data sets (for example, fossils, can provide general paleolatitudes as well as isotopic analysis to constrain latitudes), and if sample numbers are high enough they would either provide you with a data set in which they all average out (one which you could therefore use), or a data set that would tell you nothing with regard to the paleomagnetic data because the data would be far too scattered.

Maybe it wasn't the rocks and moved it was the magnetic fields.

When the poles move relative to a fixed reference frame (which they have always done) it's known as [apparent polar wander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_polar_wander), when the actual poles move it's known as [true polar wander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_polar_wander) (which has been used to explain the ~800Ma [Bitter Springs carbon isotope excursion](https://i.imgur.com/xDQQykX.jpg)).

It should also be noted that the further one goes back in time, the larger the margin of error. To that extent paleomagnetic data is often taken, by many, with a grain of salt when discussing older data sets as stepwise demagnetization of any remnant magnetization (thermoremanent magnetization, chemical remanent magnetization, depositional remanent magnetization, viscous remanent magnetization), should it exist, may not yield viable or valuable results. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tridymite may be found with basalt, but I don't believe it is of primary origin, forming from later alteration events as basalt does not contain enough free SiO2 (they're at opposite ends of Bowen's reaction series). 

Fe-rich olivine is relatively much less common, but it occurs in igneous rocks in small amounts in rare granites and rhyolites, and extremely Fe-rich olivine can exist stably with quartz and tridymite. In contrast, Mg-rich olivine does not occur stably with silica minerals, as it would react with them to form orthopyroxene ((Mg,Fe)2Si2O6). - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine#Identification_and_paragenesis) 

The following is from the study:

Tridymite Formation Pathways

... Many terrestrial tridymite occurrences are associated with silicic volcanism, which, by its nature, has the requisites of high temperatures and high-SiO2 lava compositions (dacite and rhyolite) for tridymite formation within its stability field. Vapor-phase formation of tridymite (along with sanidine and iron oxides) occurs in vugs and lithophysae in rhyolitic ash-flow tuff (2835). For example, the mineral stratigraphy within compound cooling units of a rhyolitic ash-flow tuff showed tridymite is most abundant (25 wt.%) in the central zone where temperatures were highest and occurs along with sanidine as crystals growing into voids; cristobalite and sanidine occur in cooler zones where replacement of glass predominates (30). Tridymite derived from oxidation of fayalite has also been reported in a rhyolite flow (Oregon) (36). At the Iwodake rhyolitic cone of Satsuma-Iwojima volcano (Japan), a tridymite formation pathway is alteration of rhyolite by volcanic vapors and acidic hydrothermal fluids at temperatures up to 900 C (3740). Acid sulfate leaching of rhyolite also occurred there, increasing the SiO2 concentration from 71 wt.% to 97 wt.%

 ... 

The temperature regime associated with basaltic and intermediate volcanism can also provide a formation pathway for tridymite when the requisite high-SiO2 material is present... In altered basalts from Stromboli volcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy) and andesites from Augustine volcano (Alaska), the high-SiO2 host for tridymite is the residue after acid sulfate leaching of primary mafic rock (42, 43).

As you mention, the amount of tridymite found is also quite telling:

... The high concentrations of tridymite (14 wt.% of bulk sample) and SiO2 (74 wt.%) for the Buckskin sample are not reasonably sourced from low-silica volcanics... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Under the assumption that the studies interpretation is correct, that the tridymite (SiO2) is primary and most likely volcanic in origin, it requires a magma source that is relatively high in silica as tridymite is a polymorph of SiO2. For magma to become rich in silica (SiO2) it has to undergo differentiation. Following [Bowen's reaction series](https://i.imgur.com/SaWgr2f.gif), the melt will contain a higher fraction of silica the more the magma is differentiated. Because of this, certain magmas typify specific geologic conditions. *Generally speaking*, magma erupting along sea floor spreading centres (rifts), and hot spots (Hawaii, Iceland, etc.) will be of basaltic composition resulting from partial melting of the asthenosphere; magmas erupting along volcanic arcs will incorporate more water from their position along subduction zones and be of andesitic composition; magmas that make their way up through continental crust will differentiate the most and are of rhyolitic composition. Magma rises due to density contrasts - once it becomes neutrally buoyant it stalls and crystallizes until a fraction of the remaining melt is positively buoyant again. This new melt composition begins to rise until it becomes neutrally buoyant, and [the process repeats itself](https://i.imgur.com/Y5EEUOO.jpg). Each time it stalls, the melt fraction will become more rich in silica as more elements such as Fe, and Mg are the first to crystallize (recall Bowen's reaction series) progressing as follows:

- Ultra mafic *(peridotite / komatiite with SiO2  45%)* 

- Mafic *(gabbro / basalt with SiO2 4552%)* 

- Intermediate *(diorite / andesite with SiO2 5263%)*

- Intermediate - felsic *(granodiorite / dacite with SiO2 6369%)*

- Felsic *(granite / rhyolite with SiO2  69%)*

Olympus Mons, by the way, is a shield volcano, similar to Hawaii, with a basaltic composition.

So what does this all mean? It means that not all volcanoes are the same, and their associated lava flows / magma can tell you about the geological conditions surrounding its formation. To find terrestrial tridymite, volcanic in origin, means it must have formed from a magma exceptionally rich in SiO2 (ie. dacite and rhyolite). The general view of Mars is that of a purely basaltic planet, however, the discovery of tridymite adds support to previous studies that infer high SiO2 compositions, and thus the geological evolution of Mars. 

Things can get quite complex, for example discussing the different polymorphs of silica such as alpha and beta tridymite, etc. but I hope I kept this explanation general enough to follow along and grasp the basic idea as to why the discovery of tridymite on Mars is not entirely expected, as well as important in understanding how Mars evolved as a planet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It lays out the arguments, and highlights each of their weaknesses. With so many major problems for the 'blitzkrieg' hypothesis, I'm not ready to accept it as the primary contributor - as was seen in the case of the South American megafauna. In the end Hanes suggests it's likely a combination of the two, though this treads on *[argumentum ad temperantiam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation)*. As more [evidence](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/woolly-mammoth-diet-mystery-solved-by-dna-analysis-1.2524015) is discovered, hopefully, the story will be told in full. For South America, at least, it appears that climate change was most certainly the primary driver with humans potentially acting as 'the straw that broke the camels back.' </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not familiar enough with the data sets available for various locations throughout the geologic past; however, I would be hesitant to support your statement as data may be scarce, as was the case with South America, until this study, which found climate change to be the primary driver which subsequently permitted humans to potentially have a greater impact. Higher resolution data in the future may yield [a different interpretation](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/woolly-mammoth-diet-mystery-solved-by-dna-analysis-1.2524015), and as the fossil record continues to grow the trend is to push the arrival of humans even further back. Perhaps more to your point, however, one should note that not all glacial and interglacial periods were the same. For example, it is known that ice sheets obtained their maximum thickness only during the last glacial maximum, and were thinner under previous glacial periods. Rates of warming, and cooling differed, as did the magnitude of warming and cooling, and their duration, etc. 

I'm not dismissing your point entirely, but rather suggesting a little more caution before leaping to conclusions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To clarify your initial statement:

...zircons older than 3.8 Ga lack shock fractures...

Are you implying that prior to 3.8Ga there were no impacts events, and that the LHB did not occur?

Addressing the following:

Detrital zircons are created during subduction, that later turns up on younger sediment after their parent rocks have surfaced and eroded away.

Detrital simply refers to lithics that have been eroded, transported and later deposited by sedimentary processes (predominantly by fluid transport). It says nothing of the formation process of said lithic(s). Zircons do not solely form in subduction zones, and are formed through magmatic, metamorphic, and alteration (hydrothermal zircons) processes. Furthermore, zircons formed *during* impact events would obviously be devoid of shock features. Thus, detrital zircons are created by any number of processes and are later eroded and deposited elsewhere, no longer remaining in-situ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It took a while, but an idea finally took hold for how I wanted to photograph this expression. It's not exactly what I had in mind, but it works well enough such that I am confident in posting a review to accompany it.

Colour: Burnished

Body: Full bodied

Nose: Vanilla and butter, dried apricots, Orcadian peat and subtle wood smoke, Oloroso sherry.

Palate: Sweet fruity arrival, malt, floral - distinctive heather, wild honey and a hint of spice

Finish: Subtle smoke, dry, crisp, medium length and smooth

Score: 88/100

Notes: The position on the board is the final position from game 21, the final game, of the World Chess Championship between challenger Bobby Fischer of the United States and defending champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union. Fischer would go on to win the match 12.5-8.5, a crushing moment in the midst of the Cold War. On second thought I should have used game 12 to match the age of the expression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Geology**: Naniamo Group Sediments, Haslam Formation (of late Santonian to early Campanian age ~83.6Ma): dominated by grey to dark grey siltstone and mudstone / argillite and shale, with thin interbeds of fine to coarse grained sandstone. Fine grained facies may be dark grey, organic-rich and laminated, are typically calcareous, with calcareous concretions, but are more typically bioturbated. Shelly fossils are present, in distinct calcarenite beds in some locations, but not usually abundant. Thin, interbedded sandstones are generally sharp-based, laminated and rippled, display partial (B-D) Bouma turbidite sequences, and are typically arranged into coarsening and thickening upward sequences several to tens of metres thick. In addition, overall there is a general coarsening-upward trend over the entire thickness. The Haslam Formation has been interpreted to represent low-energy deposition in marine shelf to relatively deep slope depositional facies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fracking is fine when properly regulated...

What is considered to be properly regulated? Was [Texas](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-05/ssoa-hhb051016.php) 'properly regulated'? [Oklahoma](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/induced/hazards.php)? [Ohio](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2rjqad/science_ama_series_im_robert_skoumal_one_of_the/)? [California](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL066948/abstract)? [Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/more-than-90-of-larger-earthquakes-in-western-canada-triggered-by-fracking-1.3510812)? Hydraulic fracturing, as well waste water injection are both capable of inducing seismicity, depending, in part, on the underlying geology.

...if the well casing is properly constructed there will be no water contamination.

It's not just about properly cased wells (of which many are not by the way), but [subsurface pathways](http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp019s1616326). More recent studies are showing just [how much leakage is occurring](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/methane-leakage-from-natural-gas-supply-chain-could-be-higher-than-previously-estimated/) and the [significant draw backs](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/02/17/3750240/methane-leaks-erase-climate-fracked-gas/) such leaks create.

If the goal is to remain under 2C or even 1.5C by reducing emissions [by ~2020](https://andthentheresphysics.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/rcps.jpg), increasing natural gas consumption is [not the solution](http://www.vox.com/2015/11/30/9818582/paris-cop21-climate-talks) you're looking for. If that's not a concern, then it may prove as a useful transition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's world whisky day so what better time to introduce a new Canadian single malt, Shelter Point Distillery's 2016 Inaugural Run - sunsets and sea salt; Barley is grown on-site, distilled in traditional Scottish copper pot stills, and then aged in white oak barrels.

Colour: Pale Straw

Body: Full bodied, soft and round

Nose: Vanilla and malt, Citrus, Fruity apple

Palate: A bite of citrus zest with a spoon of marmalade followed by cooked fruit, and fresh apples carried on a summer's breeze by the ocean. 

Finish: An explosion of pepper, dry, and warming. Lingering layers of candied apples rolled in sea salt.

Score: 82/100

Notes: Although it carries a warm finish with a good bit of bite, it is exceptionally smooth for its age. A mere five years of age, aged in barrels from Maker's Mark, at 46% ABV it easily behaves like a ten year old. It's not an exceptional single malt, but for its price at the time of purchase ($68.99CAD) it's certainly worth a try if you can get your hands on it. This is the inaugural release, so I fully expect the distillery to perfect their recipe over the coming years and could easily bump the score up another 2 points or more.

<TEXT> I think you might be under the impression that induced seismicity is only generated from hydraulic fracturing, however, induced seismicity is also generated from disposal wells (waste water injection). In Texas, Mw4.0+ events have been [attributed to waste water injection](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JB012821/abstract?campaign=wlytk-41855.5282060185), with minor events being attributed to hydraulic fracturing. The underlying geology and regional stress regimes are crucial factors to consider as to whether the play might be susceptible to either hydraulic fracturing, waste water injection, or both, through time. For example, in [Western Canada](http://srl.geoscienceworld.org/content/87/3/631), induced seismicity (Mw4.0+) has been attributed to hydraulic fracturing rather than waste water injection.

Perhaps I misinterpreted your statement, but I hope my statement may help clear up some ambiguity.

Jadeite has a hardness of [~6.5](http://webmineral.com/data/Jadeite.shtml) - 7.0 depending on its properties, while Nephrite (technically a rock comprising mostly massive microcrystalline to cryptocrystalline felted amphiboles of the tremolite - actinolite series) is around 6.0 - 6.5 again depending on its properties. While Jadeite (a pyroxene - single chain inosilicate) is relatively hard, it is not tough. Nephrite, on the other hand, is very tough because it is made of [felted amphiboles](https://dcgiaorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/april012.jpg) (double chain inosilicates) that act analogously as interwoven strands of rope.

*This GPS station on Mount St. Helens is one of the many ways volcanologists can monitor the day-to-day activity at an active volcano (even when its at rest).Adam Mosbrucker / USGS*
___



When it comes down to it, volcanoes spend most of their existence not erupting. If you look at almost any volcano, it might have a bout of eruption for days to months at a time, then go quiet for decades, centuries or more. So when you think about the activity at any given volcano, you should not only concern yourself with what might be happening when the volcano is actually coughing stuff up (erupting), but also when, at the surface, things look perfectly calm.

There are a number of ways to examine what a volcano was/is doing during these periods of repose. [My research](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113157) is like that of a historian, trying to understand what was going on before eruptions that have already happened. I do this by [looking at the evidence of changes in the magmatic system recorded in the crystals](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/under-the-volcano-lassen-chaos-crags-crystals/) that are brought up during an eruption. There you find the record of intrusions of new magma occurring frequently, even during times when the volcanic system might not erupt for 100,000 years! So the real action at many volcanoes might be happening kilometers beneath our feet.

Now, if you want to be more like a journalist and look at what might be going in at the moments between eruptions, you can [turn to seismology](https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/earthquakes.html). At many volcanoes, there is a constant background din of small earthquakes caused by magma, hot gasses, hot water, or faults underneath the volcano. They can occur in swarms and across a [wide range of depths](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/monitoring_seismicity.html)from the mantle source of the magma all the way to the surface. You can use the number of earthquakes and their depth to start to weave a story of how magma might be moving underneath a volcano during those quiet periods.

*Sometimes keeping a seismic station running during winter is difficult. USGS technicians Kelly Swinford and Amberlee Darold are shown here getting a St. Helens station back online on March 30, 2016.Seth Moran / USGS*
___

The [USGS](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/index.html) and the [Pacific Northwest Seismic Network](http://www.pnsn.org/) has arrays of seismometers on many of the Cascade volcanoes to [watch these earthquakes](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/st_helens/monitoring_earthquakes.html), so hopefully well know well in advance if any of these volcanoes are waking up. It isnt easy to keep the seismic array on these volcanoes running during the winter, as the picture of the seismometer on Mount St. Helens above image shows! So you should be impressed that we have the near real-time seismic data at our fingertips.

One such story of a volcano recharging is being written right now at [Mount St. Helens](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/st_helens/) in Washington. Since the start of 2016 (see below), an earthquake swarm has been detected underneath the currently-quiet Washington volcano. These earthquakes have been occurring from depths of ~2 to over 7 kilometers beneath the volcano. [USGS volcanologists and seismologists are interpreting](https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/cvo_news_archive.html) this swarm as a response to the slow recharging for the volcano, where new magma is rising up underneath St. Helens as it slumbers. As the magma intrudes, it imparts pressure on the rock around it and it heats up water/releases gases that can add to that pressure. This generates small earthquakes as the rocks shift in response to that stress.

Now, this might make some people nervous, but if you look at the compilation of earthquakes from St. Helens over its periods of repose since 1988 (see above), you can see that it has had a lot of recharge eventsand most of these dont directly lead to an eruption. In fact, if you look at the biggest recharge swarms prior to the 2004 revival of eruptions, it might have been 5 years between that big recharge event in 1998-99 and the [2004 eruptions](http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3036/fs2005-3036.html).

Even in the time since the end of the 2004-08 eruptions, there have been little earthquake swarms: early 2012, early 2014, and now the most vigorous in 2016. These are all normal behavior for a volcano as active as St. Helens. As the USGS report on the earthquake swarm mentions, there are no other signs of potential eruption right now: no changes in gas emissions, no deformation, and no shallow seismicity (2 kilometers) that are generally associated with an impeding eruption. However, it does mean that even as St. Helens sleeps, the magma that will likely take part in the next eruption is working its way up towards the surface, likely stopping along the way to crystallize and interact with the residue of previous eruptions.

It might take a big recharge event to really get the system primed for the next eruption. This questionwhat might ultimately trigger that next eruptionis one of the big ones in volcanology. However, what we can say is that no volcano is truly dormant when its not erupting. Its just that most of the action is happening far beneath our feet.

<TEXT> Asteroids are typically found orbiting between Mars and Jupiter in what is called the asteroid belt, with the majority within the [main belt](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7485/images/nature12908-f1.jpg), and are the remnants of the protoplanetary disk and are classified into various types by [their composition](http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/asteroid-and-meteorite-types.jpg). Because they orbit the sun, having a rather circular orbit relative to comets, they travel at lower velocities. 

Comets (long and short period) can have quite elliptical orbits relative to those of asteroids, so their velocities can be far greater. They are also thought to be remnants of the early solar system though they are believed, mostly, to have formed further away from the Sun (beyond the [frost line](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/ast110_06/quizzes/Formation.jpg)), and have a composition that includes water ice, nitrogen ice, ammonia and organics, and are commonly termed "dirty snowballs." 
Long period comets tend to have randomly orientated orbits and originate from the [Oort cloud](http://global.jaxa.jp/article/interview/2013/vol81/img/img_03_l.jpg). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trust me, if there was a strong link it would be everywhere...

That's not how geology works... at all. You can refuse to accept the literature, but it's out there, published, and definitive, and denying it won't get you anywhere. To be clear no one is saying that every seismic event is induced, let alone every event 4.0Mw. What the science shows, however, is that hydraulic fracturing and waste water injection can both generate seismicity 4.0Mw, and that attribution between the events that have been analyzed is robust. I should also state that this study on seismic events triggered by mantle delamination does not refute events already attributed to induced seismicity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No it did not. That was the target depth for 1993 of which it never achieved, and it did not drill beyond a depth of ~12km. 

There are a number of research papers, and a growing body of evidence, that have definitively linked seismic events 4.0Mw to induced seismicity, either through hydraulic fracturing (see British Columbia, and Ohio(?)) or waste water injection through disposal wells (see Oklahoma, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arkansas, and Ohio).

<TEXT> There are a lot of statements within that article that, to properly address your question, would take considerable time and effort to research and cite. I would also state that I am by no means an expert with regard to whisky, and the details within. 

I would, with some degree of speculation and well educated assumptions, however, feel somewhat inclined to agree with the following though also remaining, to a lesser degree, somewhat sceptical:

Oxygen is extremely reactive, and makes up for about one fifth of our atmosphere. Almost any material undergoes a chemical reaction when exposed to oxygen, a common example being metal rusting. Exposing a distilled alcohol to oxygen will cause chemical reactions with the unwanted congeners mentioned above, facilitating their removal from the product. Wood is porous, allowing for only small amounts of air to pass in and out of the barrel, controlling the rate at which the congeners are oxidized. During this process, some ethanol will also oxidize or simply evaporate, and the proof (alcohol-by-volume) will drop slightly. This is called the "angel's share," as early distillers saw the volume drop by itself and so believed that angels watched over their products and took some as payment. The type of climate aside from temperature does play a small role here, though not a very important one. For example, barrels aging near the ocean will absorb small amounts of salt water, but this is very low on the list of reactions affecting the spirit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's quoted quite often from a number of distilleries, though it's often met with a degree of scepticism. The following is an excerpt from "*Micheal Jackson's Complete Guide to Single Malt Scotch*" 

Seaweed: *The medicinal note in most Isla malts, especially Laphroaig, surely derives from seaweed, a source of iodine. The sea washes against the walls at all distilleries, except Bruichladdich and Kilchoman, and the coast is enwrapped with seaweed. How do the seaweedy, ironlike aromas get into the spirit? It seems likely that that they are carried ashore by the winds and the rain, and permeate the peaty surface of the island. Then, when the rivers and burns flow over the peat to the distilleries, they pick up these flavors and impart them in the steep or the mash tun. If the boggy surface is, indeed, impregnated with the seaweedy rain, then a further opportunity will arise when the peat is cut and burned in the distillery's maltings.*

Breathing Spirit: *The greatest scepticism concerns the belief that the casks in the warehouses "breathe in" the atmosphere. Distillers who use central warehouses, away from the distillery, especially favor this argument*...

As for the actual science, it seems difficult to locate assuming it exits at all. A quick search did provide papers on flavours derived from the [composition of the peat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19243172), [lignin](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0010%2819990515%2979:7%3C1015::AID-JSFA321%3E3.0.CO;2-R/abstract), and [charring](http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jhb/whisky/papers/charring.htm) etc., but nothing on "breathing." </TEXT>

<TEXT> No it's not, and the study TrillianSC2 references is an older study not without its criticisms. Furthermore, several other studies published after his cited study continue to argue in favour of Deccan Trap volcanism, or a combination of the two ^[1](https://news.berkeley.edu/2015/04/30/did-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-trigger-largest-lava-flows-on-earth/) . Perhaps more pertinent information is discussed within the paper itself, but going from the article alone I'm certainly not convinced of their argument. We have good [fossil evidence](http://www.yalescientific.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/volcanism4.jpg) in support of ocean acidification. Questions remain regarding the assumptions this study used regarding ocean conditions at the time, and how they modeled its behavior. My point is that /u/Gypsiee is absolutely correct in stating that the debate is ongoing.

EDIT: The Harvard Museum of Natural History hosted a lecture in March of 2015 called "*The Cretaceous-Tertiary Mass Extinction: What Really Killed the Dinosaurs?*" and if you think the debate is settled I would highly recommend spending the time to watch it, it's available on youtube. 

Excerpt:

Of the three mass extinctions that have occurred since 250 million years ago, they are all very precisely associated with large flood basalt volcanism, large igneous provinces (LIPs). The Deccan Traps for the K-T boundary, the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, and the Siberian Traps at the Permo-Triassic boundary. So the outlier is the Chicxulub crater of the K-T impact at K-T time. There is no evidence that is widely subscribed to for impact at any of these other boundaries. It gets worse. The Permo-Triassic boundary was recently shown, understood to be a double boundary with a peak here at the end of middle Permian or Guadalupian epoch and then the bigger peak at the end of the Permian. And the Emeishan Traps, eruptions in China, were at 260 million years ago at [this little peak](https://imgur.com/uBJ54BC) and then the Siberian Traps are here... so actually, the last four mass extinction events for which we have the best record are all associated with massive volcanism on the planet...  

The excerpt is not an attempt to convince you of one particular argument, but rather to convey to you that it is certainly not a settled debate, Alvarez himself shares just such an opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the USGS: 

Can you prevent large earthquakes by making lots of small ones...?

Seismologists have observed that for every magnitude 6 earthquake it would take 32 magnitude 5's, 1000 magnitude 4's, 32,000 magnitude 3's (and so on for smaller earthquakes) to equal the energy of one magnitude 6 event. So, even though we always record many more small events than large ones there are never enough to eliminate the need for the occasional large earthquake. </TEXT>

Internal exposure levels were not a part of their study, so it should come as no surprise that they didn't look at that. 

That's how scientific studies are done, typically focusing and examining, in detail, a single variable or attribute. Now they have more data than they previously had, and internal radiation exposure can remain an area for future research. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 40cm (0.4m or 15.748 inches) sounds like a fair amount, but it pales in comparison to the solid rock tides of Jupiter's moon Io. As it orbits Jupiter it flexes resulting in immense tidal heating as the gravitational pull from Jupiter and it's moons change from with its location.

[Here](http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/io-tides/en/gll_moons1.en.gif) the gravity of Jupiter and large moon Ganymede (with help from moons Europa and Callisto) play tug-o'-war with Io playing the part of the rope! Io bulges on two sides. And, [here](http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/io-tides/en/gll_moons2.en.gif), Jupiter and all three of the other large moons pull on the same side of Io.  Io flexes again. This flexing of Io, tidal heating, leads to sold rock tides upwards of ~91m! There's a reason Io is considered the most volcanically active body in our solar system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A number of people have already stated several ways in which local gravity changes (ie. contrasts in subsurface density) but no one has pointed out the actual corrections that are accounted for during a gravity survey. When all of the necessary corrections are completed the remaining anomaly is known as the Bougeur anomaly (g_B):

`g_B = g^obs - g^base - g_D  g_L  g_FA - g_B + g_TC  g_E`

- g^obs is the gravity observed once solid Earth tidal corrections have been removed.

- g^base is removed permitting all site measurements to be correlated relative to the base station.

- g_D is applied hence removing instrumental drift over time. 

- g_L is applied to account for differences in Earths radius as a function of latitude. 

- g_FA is the free air (elevation) correction and is applied in order to correct for elevation changes relative to the base station.

- g_B is the Bougeur plate correction, and acts opposite to that of the free air correction.

- g_TC is the terrain correction and is applied when significant topographical differences are present.

- g_E is the Etvs correction and is applied for surveys conducted while in motion (on a ship, etc).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't see what's so funny, it's a factual statement that you clearly lack the required information to make an educated assessment. That's not an ad hominem, that is very likely an objective and factually correct statement. However, I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt with that statement, because the other option is that you do have the required information to make an educated assessment but are simply incapable of forming the correct conclusion.

As I mentioned before, it's not just about trend analysis you have to look at the data alongside the trend. [Correlation and causation are easily confused](http://cardinschoolblog.blogspot.ca/2009/10/does-ice-cream-cause-drowning.html) and without looking at the data itself this is one of the many faults (no pun intended) you are making.

The scientists working [within](http://online.wr.usgs.gov/calendar/2015/aug15.html) and [outside](https://news.stanford.edu/news/2015/june/okla-quake-drilling-061815.html) of the USGS have all reached the correct conclusion, and yet you continue to maintain your contrarian view based on little, if any, understanding of geological processes. One last point I'd like to make... if you're proposing an argument to support your position it's good practice to at least know and use the correct terminology. You have consistently used "fracking" in the context of Oklahoma which is, so far as we are currently aware, incorrect. Induced seismicity in Oklahoma is a result of wastewater injection (disposal) wells, and not hydraulic fracturing as has been attributed to induced seismicity elsewhere.

<TEXT> I never said Oklahoma wasn't seismically active, I said it was "not very seismically active, relatively speaking." By its very nature, intracratonic, it is seismically limited.

Unfortunately I believe you're drawing conclusions based on ignorance, and I'm not willing to dedicate the necessary time it would require to convince you. There are far more data that are analyzed at length that have been used to draw the current scientific position on induced seismicity. Trends in data are one thing, the data itself is quite another. When one clearly lacks the required academic background to asses the data (not just the trend) it's considered a wise and intelligent choice to listen to those of whom do carry the necessary qualifications to make such statements (ie, geologists, geophysicists / seismologists).

<TEXT> The relationship in Oklahoma between waste water injection and proximity to fault lines is the major contributor to induced seismicity in the region. In other words, injection of fluids at depth increases subsurface strain regimes along seismically inactive fault planes, subsequently leading to their reactivation. 

Unlike Oklahoma, where the leading cause of induced seismicity is due to waste water injection at depth, hydraulic fracturing has been directly attributed to induced seismicity in [Ohio](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2rjqad/science_ama_series_im_robert_skoumal_one_of_the/), and [Western Canada](http://www.seismosoc.org/news/ssa-press-releases/fracking-linked-to-most-induced-earthquakes-in-western-canada/) where the apparent dichotomy is a result of the underlying geology of the region. 

I've seen data that shows that Oklahoma has had almost no earthquakes since before 2010...

Oklahoma is not very seismically active, relatively speaking. The [increase in seismicity](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/11/oklahoma-now-no-1-in-earthquakes.html) is linked to the increase in production ([see graph](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/oklahoma/images/OklahomaEQsBarGraph.png)), and can further be seen from the timing of the events which typically occur relatively shortly after injection.

<TEXT> If you're extracting a resource, do you think it might be important to know what effects your activities are having in the subsurface and how they are being generated? While it's important to consider the felt effects on the surface to the general populace, if you're activities are near well populated regions, it's important to a) recognize that what you previously did not take into consideration must now be considered and b) what those effects are, and what the cause is. 

There a lot of variables at play, for example, induced seismicity in Oklahoma is typically attributed to waste water injection, while in Ohio there have been a number that have been attributed to hydraulic fracturing (similar to British Columbia). It's important to understand then why the dichotomy exists so that you can understand the potential risks associated with the activity as well as how to mitigate it or avoid it to begin with.

Recall the historical trend has been along the lines of 1) Hydraulic fracturing can't cause earthquakes 2) Waste water injection is the cause of the increase in earthquakes within some areas, not hydraulic fracturing 3) Hydraulic fracturing, not waste water injection, is found to generate earthquakes but they are thought to be small ( [minor earthquakes](http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/magnitude.html)) 4) Hydraulic fracturing is linked to minor earthquakes 5) Hydraulic fracturing is linked to light earthquakes       

With the above noted, I would direct you to the following study regarding two earthquakes of 4.0Mw and 4.3Mw that occurred near Cushing Oklahoma as to better understand why these events, even though they may be barely noticeable to you, are of concern: [Reactivated faulting near Cushing, Oklahoma: Increased potential for a triggered earthquake in an area of United States strategic infrastructure](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064669/full) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are theoretical limitations with regard to the potential size of induced seismicity depending on its origin (waste water injection, or hydraulic fracturing). It has always been the position that seismicity induced by waste water injection has the potential to be larger than seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing. An event with a moment magnitude that resides nearest the upper theoretical limits may then be called a "large" event within the proper context. In other words, induced seismicity from hydraulic fracturing that sits above 4.0Mw is a large event when induced by hydraulic fracturing. 

Similarly, it is a generally accepted that mega-thrust earthquakes are the only type of displacement capable of generating a 9.0Mw and that strike-slip motion is simply incapable of generating great earthquakes. So for [a strike-slip rupture to generate a 8.6Mw](http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/sumatran-strike-slip-earthquakes-challenge-seismologists) is an exceptionally "large" seismic event for being generated through strike-slip displacement.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> Waste water injection is (currently) a part of the overall process for hydraulic fracturing so it's common for the general public to be less pedantic about the technicalities and simply lump the two together. Waste water injection is not injected into preexisting faults. It is injected into the subsurface at depth, increasing pore pressures, which increases strain on nearby faults which can reactivate them. Hydraulic fracturing, although rare, has been [directly attributed to induced seismicity](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2rjqad/science_ama_series_im_robert_skoumal_one_of_the/) (Ohio, British Columbia) amongst induced seismicity as a result of waste water injection (Oklahoma). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The canyons, and other relatively low regions have less gravity because they have less mass present compared to regions of higher elevation. Notice that, without going into detail, that holds for Earth as well with higher anomalies present under mountain ranges and volcanic centres compared to those observed along the oceanic crust ([figure](http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/3000/3666/PIA04652_lrg.jpg)).

<TEXT> A convecting liquid outer-core is essential for Earth's self sustaining geo-dynamo. Earth's outer core is ~2,260km thick, and hot. Mar's outer core is ~200km thick and likely relatively cool in comparison to that of Earth's. It's likely convecting, but as it is likely cooler it's likely convecting at much slower rates - sluggish compared to that of Earth. It's also  10% the width of Earth's outer core so if it did exist it should be much weaker in comparison. Together, sluggish convection over a relatively small region, seems like a reasonable explanation as to the lack of a Martian magnetosphere.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The gravity anomaly is known as the Bouguer anomaly (g_B) once all the necessary correction factors have been applied. Gravity increases with height as you have more mass below you (Bouguer correction) but gravity also decreases with height as you move further away from the centre of mass (Free-air correction). 

`g_B = g^obs - g^base - g_D  g_L  g_FA - g_B + g_TC  g_E`

- g^obs is the gravity observed once solid Earth tidal corrections have been removed.

- g^base is removed permitting all site measurements to be correlated relative to the base station.

- g_D is applied hence removing instrumental drift over time. 

- g_L is applied to account for differences in Earths radius as a function of latitude. 

- g_FA is the free air (elevation) correction and is applied in order to correct for elevation changes relative to the base station.

- g_B is the Bougeur plate correction, and acts opposite to that of the free air correction.

- g_TC is the terrain correction and is applied when significant topographical differences are present.

- g_E is the Etvs correction and is applied for surveys conducted under while in motion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does, and it's typically called a phreatomagamatic eruption. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are a result of magma coming into contact with water. In the ocean this results in the formation of hyaloclastite infilling pillow basalts. On land, these eruptions often end up forming tuff rings and maars as the rising magma (dyke) comes into contact with the water table ([illustration](http://s3images.coroflot.com/user_files/individual_files/original_242024_5bxc9veozNbBK4d7kcq82wbsx.jpg)).

<TEXT> There are far too many to list so to be honest, but here's a short list which could keep you busy for a while.

Vancouver Island - Exploring any of the Gulf Island, particularly Hornby Island. It has fantastic beaches to explore with great tafoni weathering, and fossils during low tide at Collishaw Point. 
Horne Lake caves are great good for caving, made of crinoidal limestone. Fossils tend to lay within the Naniamo group predominantly, and a hike up Trent and Puntledge rivers has yielded an Elasmosaur and Mosasaur among the many ammonites. Hikes within Strathcona Provincial Park and the area around Myra Falls. Hikes throughout the West Coast trail and the North Coast trail along Cape Scott.

Haida Gwaii - Agate beach (need I say more?), and Tow Hill (and old volcanic plug surrounded by blow holes).

Lower Mainland: Lots, there is so much. Britannia Mine Museum, the entire Sea-to-Sky dry, hiking in and around Whistler - such as the Black Tusk. Head towards Pemberton, if conditions are right, check out Key hole falls and the hot springs. Head to Upper Joffrey Lakes for more good hikes surrounded by glaciers and enjoy the drive along the Duffy Lake Road. There are hotsprings located at Harrison Lake as well which has a fantastically rich history of gold and curses (see Slumachs Gold, Lost Creek Gold, the Lost Creek Mine, or the Lost Mine of Pitt Lake). Travel the coquihalla for an impressive view of massive plutons, and stroll through Othello Tunnels near Hope (don't forget to drive through "the Canyon" and Hell's Gate).

Check out any number of parks and the hikes within. Wells Gray, Kootenay, Banff, and Yoho National Parks (the world UNESCO Burgess Shale, Mt. Rundle and so much more).

Check out Rock Candy Mine near Grand Forks to dig up your own fluorite. Explore old ghost towns such as the Phoenix Mine and Phoenix city, and Barkerville. Tour the historic gold mine at Rossland - Le Roi Gold Mine. Head to the Purcell Mountains to hike the Mt. Nimbus Via Ferrata.

Further north you can visit Jade city, and head to Stewart / Hyder to check out glaciers, and the history of the area known as the Golden Triangle, and more specifically a gorgeous hike through the historic Mount Edziza Provincial Park. Check out Nisga'a Memorial Lava Bed Provincial Park host to the Tseax Cone. 

I'm certain I have left out a plethora but if you're interested in the geology of the areas and not just the beauty it's best to find a companion book that can help point you to significant geological features in the area. For example, "Roadside Geology of Southern British Columbia" and "Geology of Southern Vancouver Island."

For Alberta, the obvious one stands out - the Drumheller area hoodoos and hikes, Dinosaur Provincial Park and the Royal Tyrrell Museum. The McConnell Thrust at Mt. Yamnuska near Exshaw. Of course, as I've stated, there are a lot to explore but hopefully that can help guide in a good direction. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Events | Earth | Mars
---|---|----
Formation | 4.543Ga| 4.503Ga
H2O by | 4.4Ga |  3.8Ga
LHB | 4.1Ga | 4.1Ga
Fossil life | 3.5Ga | N/A

Assuming the Cool early Earth - it took ~143Ma for the presence of water on Earth to occur. I don't have a figure for Mars, but let's assume it to be equal for the sake of simplicity. It follows then that we have water on Mars by 4.36Ga (consistent with   3.8Ga). The time span between the two periods of water present on the surfaces of the two planets is a mere 40Ma. According to the fossil record, life on Earth didn't emerge until ~3.5Ga or 1Ga after its formation. Taking the fossil record into account and our educated estimate relative to significant events in planetary histories it seems far more reasonable to invoke Occam's razor and forgo the added complexities of interplanetary panspermia in favor of a far more simpler origin... that carbon based life as we know it, originated on Earth.

Interstellar panspermia is another story all together though I think it's likely pointless to even consider (how can you test it?). All that being said, I'm not outright denying the possibility, I simply think it's far more likely that carbon based life as we know it originated on Earth (and it's fun to at least try to put some numbers in where I can).

<TEXT> The time scale in regard to the evolution of life is not supportive of panspermia being more or less likely if each planet contains the same initial potential for life and each planet was presumably just as uninhabitable as the next due to temperatures being too high. 

Furthermore, recall that there is evidence that goes against a hot inhospitable early Earth as well:

Extensive surface water of indeterminate temperature and long-lived continental crust... present by 4.4 billion years ago.

<TEXT> /u/Slimdiddler summarized it nicely, but I'll try to expand on the summary in a bit more detail. There are three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon C12, C13, and C14. C12 and C13 are stable isotopes while C14 is unstable and will decay relatively quick. C14 is produced by cosmic rays and makes up only a tiny fraction of the total carbon (0.1%). C13 constitutes ~1.1% and C12 the remaining 98.9%. For that reason we can look at the ratio of C13 to C12, noted as [13C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9413C). The more positive the value (typically understood as the "excursion") the more C13 is present. The smaller the value the less C13 there is. In general then a (+) means it's heavy and will have more C13, and a (-) value means it has considerably less C13, or it is "lighter". This process can be done for a multitude of other stable isotopes including oxygen, which again has three stable isotopes, O16, O17, and O18. The ratio of O18 to O16 is known as "delta 18 O" or [18O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9418O). Different processes (fractionation) will give rise to different ratios. Plants find it energetically favourable to use the lighter isotopes (12C) when they convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into food so the result should be a (-) excursion in 13C and indeed this is what see with plants: C4 plants have a 13C of 16 to 10, and C3 plants have a 13C of 33 to 24. This is known as an isotopic signature, or in essence, a type of finger print. Combining multiple isotopic signatures can help unravel numerous mysteries and is also a branch of forensics. This is also how we can trace where the carbon in our atmosphere is coming from and state with confidence that the (-) excursion in 13C can be attributed to the burning of fossil fuels (known as [the Suess Effect](https://imgur.com/A8hvCcl)). So when people state that the carbon is organic, they are referring to the 13C value, as it is typically a tell tale sign as to which process may have given rise to said value, and is a very powerful tool. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a common misunderstanding. Geochemical processes don't solely rely on elemental mass, but are dictated by such things as ionic radius and valence which give rise to the compatibility of an element, or stated else wise the [incompatibility of an element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_element). This is why, for example, the crust is enriched in potassium, uranium, and thorium where as the mantle is relatively depleted in these LILE and HFSE elements.

It is for these reasons that some Earth scientists prefer to use the [Railsback Periodic Table](http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/PT/815PeriodicTable48d013600.jpg) over the more traditional table. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The narrower the gap between when we know life existed and when we know it couldn't yet arise, the less likely it is that it arose during that span of time in that environment.

My point is that such a gap, though important for the time scale in regard to the evolution of life, is not supportive of panspermia being more or less likely if each planet contains the same initial potential for life and each planet was presumably just as uninhabitable as the next due to temperatures being too high. 

Recall that there is evidence that goes against a hot inhospitable early Earth as well:

Extensive surface water of indeterminate temperature and long-lived continental crust... present by 4.4 billion years ago. Surficial weathering by liquid water between 0 and 100C occurred by 4.2 billion years ago... - [Initiation of clement surface conditions on the earliest Earth](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/7/3666.full) (pdf) 

Otherwise known as the [Cool early Earth](http://geoscience.wisc.edu/geoscience/people/faculty/john-valley/a-cool-early-earth/) which existed shortly after the formation of the moon ~4.45Ga and prior to the Late Heavy Bombardment ~4.1 - 3.8Ga. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are two types of Jade: Nephrite, and Jadeite. This certainly doesn't look like Nephrite and a piece of Jadeite that large would be significantly expensive (ie. there's no way that's Jadeite). Common faux Jades are typically made of soapstone, serpentine (such as bowenite), chrysoprase, quartz (aventurine) etc.

Typically values are assigned by similar methods as diamonds (consistency, cut, clarity, colour) except that cut isn't really that relevant for Jade. Consistent (texture) - you want the same colour throughout, no changes in colour or imperfections, fractures, inclusions, etc. Clarity - the more translucent the better. Colour - this depends but more often then not the closer one is to an "imperial green" the higher the value assigned. Size is another factor but the primary ones that dictate the price relative to the size are already listed above.

Of course it can become more complicated as well with Type A (all natural, untreated), B (chemically bleached and or injected with polymer to remove impurities and enhance translucency), and C (the same as B but with dye to enhance colour).

Top quality Jadeite can fetch a fair penny. This pair of [Jadeite bangles](https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1202/1579/4m/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/06/18/article-0-1A611708000005DC-42_1024x615_large.jpg) sold for 3,732,365. 

A quick and easy way to eliminate some possibilities would be to do a scratch test. </TEXT>

It can be a bit of a pain at times because I force myself to wait for a specific shot or to think of something creative (that can take a while) and then I hope the shot turns out. For example, I have an Ardbeg 10 review to share and attempted a few creative photos with it, from different angles, etc. I thought they turned out well until I left the location, returned home only to find a reflection on the bottle and a smudge mark that ruined everything for me. Now I have to find not only the time, but the right weather   lighting again to attempt the shot before I share the review... it's a lot of fun though so I'm glad to hear that you're enjoying the photos as well as the review(s). </TEXT>

*Nose*: A smoldering peat bog with vanilla, and toffee. Pipe tobacco and sea spray.

*Palate*: A divine sweetness rushes to the front of the lips with fruit, citrus, vanilla and spice only to be subdued by peaty smoke, and then more peat. Upon a long exhale the ghost of a smoldering peat bog emerges in full.      

*Finish*: Warming, long and lingering. A hint of sea spray before the smoke from a smoldering peat bog rises and coats the walls of your mouth.

*Score*: 86/100

*Note*: At 208ppm phenols this peat monster will have peat pushing out from your pores; it's not for the faint-hearted. At five years of age it's truly impressive that it is so well mannered, and smooth for 59.5% abv. Some would say the cost doesn't pair well with the age, but that misses the point... it's a five year old scotch that easily behaves more than twice its age, an impressive feat that very well may justify the cost to a large degree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Atlantic Ocean is 250 million years old which means no craters from before that time are visible.

The Atlantic ocean began to open up with the break-up of [Pangea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea) which began ~175-180Ma (million years ago). Oceanic crust typically (on average) is no older than 120-140Ma due, in large part, to buoyancy. It cools as it ages, becoming negatively buoyant whereby it begins to sink into the mantle. A map of oceanic crustal ages shows that the oldest regions are no older than 180Ma which certainly includes pats of the Atlantic. ([Oceanic crustal age map](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tectonics/crustages.jpg)). Furthermore, as many others have also pointed out there are plenty of craters older than 250Ma located within continental crust. </TEXT>

Apparently the argument still hasn't sunk in. Simply because there have been numerous wells without incident doesn't mean that there cannot be wells without incident. Furthermore your reliance on such a position, as I clearly pointed out previously, is erroneous as the set of conditions has changed over time.

Great damage *can* occur... do you I really need to quote the study for a third time? It's like talking to a brick wall.

"*Seismologists have observed that for every magnitude 6 earthquake there are about 10 of magnitude 5, 100 of magnitude 4, 1,000 of magnitude 3, and so forth as the events get smaller and smaller.

It would take 32 magnitude 5's, 1000 magnitude 4's, OR 32,000 magnitude 3's to equal the energy of one magnitude 6 event. So, even though we always record many more small events than large ones, there are far too few to eliminate the need for the occasional large earthquake.*"

Within the Cascadia Subduction Zone there are three main zones. The locked zone, the transition zone, and the slip zone (see [figure](http://images.slideplayer.com/17/5276898/slides/slide_5.jpg)). These earthquakes and tremors are related to episodic tremor and slip events (depicted [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_Im-KMNJxI)   [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwfHOsAiEc)). The "Big One" is expected to rupture within the locked zone, as such, not only do smaller earthquakes not release enough strain to mitigate larger earthquakes, but these tremors have no bearing on building stress within the locked zone as these are typically occurring within the transition zone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps, I should've clarified that I was referring to quakes perceptible to anything other than sophisticated measuring devices.

You most certainly were not, and appear to be struggling to "save face." Furthermore, even if you were such a statement would still be false. Mw4.6 earthquakes are quite noticeable without the use of highly sensitive instrumentation. 

From the paper you linked: Based on results from this study and the similarity of the conjugate strike-slip fault systems in Cushing and Prague, we suggest that a moderate-magnitude (Mw5.6) earthquake, similar to the 2011 Prague earthquake (Mw5.6), could occur at the conjugate fault intersection directly beneath the Cushing oil storage facility.

I fail to see the point of this as it is in full agreement with what I've stated thus far.

Do you have evidence of a fracked well causing damage? 

Again you appear to be missing the argument being made. It is not what has been documented, but rather the potential or statistical likely hood for lack of better words. Under present conditions there factually exists a certain probability, no matter how unlikely to cause significant damage (I repeat myself):

"*Resultant very strong shaking levels (MMI VII) in the epicentral region present the possibility of this potential earthquake causing moderate to heavy damage to national strategic infrastructure and local communities.*"

Failing to recognize this is nothing short of willful ignorance, unreasonable and irresponsible. It's not "but whatever..." it's lunacy to ignore the facts when presented with them, let alone attempt to mislead others purely based on a strong personal bias that clearly overshadows ones reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Standing by your original statement is nothing short of willful ignorance. For one you claimed that

"...fracking doesn't cause earthquakes; waste water disposal does."

This is clearly incorrect, and was shown to be incorrect with multiple sources that do not support your original claim. Subsequently you have attempted to build a straw-man argument suggestive that you never made such a claim, and further implying that the study implied that hydraulic fracturing *will* generate a damaging earthquake. This is not at all what the article claims, and nor what the study I linked claims. The article states, as you yourself quoted:

"...Even a magnitude four in the right place could cause great damage."

*Could*, not *will*. Such a statement entails a probability, for which the study I linked also supports this possibility. If you wish to argue otherwise I would recommend publishing your findings. 

Furthermore statements such as

"We have been using hydro-fracking in the oil patch for over 60 years on millions of wells and while very small and imperceptible, to humans, movement can occur from fracking, there has never been a report of a fracked well causing damage... out of millions!"

must be able account for [the increase in induced seismicity](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/oklahoma/images/OklahomaEQsBarGraph.png) which it clearly cannot. It fails to take into account the increased density of well sites, and the increased pore pressures with improvements in technology amongst many others. Though the increase is largely due to waste water disposal the point should not be lost. Arguing that it's been done for "x" amount of years with little disturbance does not apply because the conditions are not the same, they've changed over the course of those years. It's an argument akin to the clich "when I was a kid..." Well grandpa I've got some news for you, things have changed since you were a kid.

Feel free to stand by your original post, but it will only highlight your personal bias on the topic as the facts state otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No it's not straight-up bullshit, it's a reality and dependent on the geology of the area, and the infrastructure. Though very unlikely to cause severe damage, it is *not* bullshit. You can read an article or the research paper (or both):

 - [New Concern Over Quakes in Oklahoma Near a Hub of U.S. Oil](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/us/new-concern-over-quakes-in-oklahoma-near-a-hub-of-us-oil.html?_r=0)

 - "*the Wilzetta-Whitetail fault zone south of Cushing, Oklahoma, could produce a large, damaging earthquake comparable to the 2011 Prague event. Resultant very strong shaking levels (MMI VII) in the epicentral region present the possibility of this potential earthquake causing moderate to heavy damage to national strategic infrastructure and local communities.*" [Reactivated faulting near Cushing, Oklahoma: Increased potential for a triggered earthquake in an area of United States strategic infrastructure](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064669/pdf) (pdf)

As a reminder to geologists and non-geologists alike: fracking *can* cause earthquakes, though the majority of induced seismicity are related to waste water disposal.

For a good review I would recommend the following:

- [Yes, Humans Really Are Causing Earthquakes](http://online.wr.usgs.gov/calendar/2015/aug15.html) presented by Justin Rubinstein, USGS Research Geophysicist

- Hydraulic fracturing linked to induced seismicity: *Science AMA Series: I'm Robert Skoumal, one of the co-authors on a paper that linked small magnitude earthquakes to hydraulic fracturing in Poland Township, Ohio, in March 2014. AMA*: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2rjqad/science_ama_series_im_robert_skoumal_one_of_the/

While the data currently leans in favour of waste water disposal being capable of producing larger magnitude events than events generated by hydraulic fracturing, seismicity in Northern BC has reached Mw4.6 due to hydraulic fracturing ([source](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/summer-earthquake-confirmed-as-largest-caused-by-fracking-in-bc/article27798765/)), and not waste water disposal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake took place at a depth of 10 kilometers.

The USGS states a depth of [0km](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us10004bnm#scientific_summary). 10km is far, far too deep for this level of activity. For some perspective the deepest hole ever drilled is the [Kola Superdeep Borehole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole) which reached an astonishing 12.2km depth but encountered numerous problems along the way and was a mere 9" in diameter. The worlds deepest mine sits at around 4km depth, the [Mponeng Gold Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mponeng_Gold_Mine), and due to the extreme environment is a feat of engineering. The geothermal gradient is about 25C per km of depth on a global average, so at 4km depth you're looking at 100C... 10km... you do the math. Given the aforementioned it becomes clear to see how it's simply not technologically possible to have such a device detonated at the depth you stated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> During deglaciation of North America, shortly after the last glacial maximum, countless glacial outburst floods occurred and are recorded in numerous locations including "[the Channeled Scablands](http://www.museumofthecity.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/LkMissoulaMap.jpg)." Upper flow rates for some events have been estimated at [386 million cubic feet per second](http://www.glaciallakemissoula.org/story.html). 

Megaripples on West Bar on the Columbia River, south of Wenatchee, Washington, were generated by surging floodwaters (glacial outburst flood) from the mouth of Moses Coulee during the Pleistocene. These enormous bedforms sit on a terrace more than ~46m (150 ft) above the present day river, and are ~90 to 110m (300 to 350 ft) long and about 8 to 12m (25 to 40 ft) high. The floodwaters are estimated to have been between 213 to 270m (700 to 900 ft) deep at this location during their deposition. - [image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/luxlaboratories/15394542861/in/album-72157648181402601/lightbox/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> At one point the Earth actually did lose its atmosphere. To explain let's take a look at Earth's atmospheric composition through time in some detail. Earth's primary atmosphere should have inherited its composition directly from the solar nebula, and the gaseous elements neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon should be present in approximate solar abundances, allowing for the addition of radiogenic isotopes; however, that is not the case. It has been repeatedly noted over the past half-century that all the noble gases are grossly depleted in the Earths atmosphere compared with solar and cosmic abundances. They are depleted, in fact, by several orders of magnitude. This means either that Earth accumulated without an atmosphere of nebular proportions or that any initial atmosphere escaped its gravity field in some subsequent episode of heating that accelerated even the heavy noble gases to escape velocities. The secondary atmosphere was generated by volcanic degassing and subsequent precipitation, whereby the oxygen was generated during [the great oxidation event](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7261/images/461179a-f1.2.jpg) much later on in Earth's geological history.  

**The Primitive Atmosphere**

Three possible sources have been considered for the Earths atmosphere: residual gases remaining after Earth accretion, extraterrestrial sources, and degassing of the Earth by volcanism. Of these, only degassing accommodates a variety of geochemical and isotopic constraints. One line of evidence supporting a degassing origin for the atmosphere is the large amount of ^40 Ar in the atmosphere (99.6%) compared with the amount in the Sun or a group of primitive meteorites known as carbonaceous chondrites (both of which contain 0.1% ^40 Ar). ^40 Ar is produced by the radioactive decay of ^40 K in the solid Earth and escapes into the atmosphere chiefly by volcanism. The relatively large amount of this isotope in the terrestrial atmosphere indicates that the Earth is extensively degassed of argon and, because of a similar behavior, of other rare gases. Although most investigators agree that the present atmosphere, except for oxygen, is chiefly the product of degassing, whether a primitive atmosphere existed and was lost before extensive degassing began is a subject of controversy. One line of evidence supporting the existence of an early atmosphere is that volatile elements should collect around planets during their late stages of accretion. This follows from the low temperatures at which volatile elements condense from the solar nebula. A significant depletion in rare gases in the Earth compared with carbonaceous chondrites and the Sun indicates that if a primitive atmosphere collected during accretion, it must have been lost. The reason for this is that gases with low atomic weights (CO2, CH4, NH3, H2, etc.) that probably composed this early atmosphere should be lost even more readily than rare gases with high atomic weights (Ar, Ne, Kr, and Xe) and greater gravitational attraction. Just how such a primitive atmosphere may have been lost is not clear. One possibility is by a T-Tauri solar wind. If the Sun evolved through a T-Tauri stage during or soon after (100 My) planetary accretion, this wind of high-energy particles could readily blow volatile elements out of the inner solar system. Another way an early atmosphere could have been lost is by impact with a Mars-size body during the late stages of planetary accretion, a model also popular for the origin of the Moon. Calculations indicate, however, that less than 30% of a primordial atmosphere could be lost during the collision of the two planets. Two models have been proposed for the composition of a primitive atmosphere. The Oparin-Urey model suggests that the atmosphere was reduced and composed dominantly of CH4 with smaller amounts of NH3, H2, He, and water; the Abelson model is based on an early atmosphere composed of CO2, CO,water, and N2. Neither atmosphere allows significant amounts of free oxygen, and experimental studies indicate that reactions may occur in either atmosphere that could produce the first life. By analogy with the composition of the Sun and the compositions of the atmospheres of the outer planets and of volatile-rich meteorites, an early terrestrial atmosphere may have been rich in such gases as CH4, NH3, and H2 and would have been a reducing atmosphere. One of the major problems with an atmosphere in which NH3 is important is that this species is destroyed directly or indirectly by photolysis in as little as 10 years. In addition, NH3 is highly soluble in water and should be removed rapidly from the atmosphere by rain and solution at the ocean surface. Although CH4 is more stable against photolysis, OH, which forms as an intermediary in the methane oxidation chain, is destroyed by photolysis at the Earths surface in less than 50 years. H2 rapidly escapes from the top of the atmosphere; therefore, it also is an unlikely major constituent in an early atmosphere. Models suggest that the earliest atmosphere may have been composed dominantly of CO2 and CH4, both important greenhouse gases.

**The Secondary Atmosphere**

*Excess Volatile*

The Earths present atmosphere appears to have formed largely by degassing of the mantle and crust and is commonly referred to as a secondary atmosphere. Degassing is the liberation of gases from within a planet, and it may occur directly during volcanism or indirectly by the weathering of igneous rocks on a planetary surface. For the Earth, volcanism appears to be most important both in terms of current degassing rates and calculated past rates. The volatiles in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and sediments that cannot be explained by weathering of the crust are known as excess volatiles. These include most of the water, CO2, and N2 in these near-surface reservoirs. The similarity in the distribution of excess volatiles in volcanic gases to those in near-surface reservoirs strongly supports a volcanogenic origin for these gases and thus supports a degassing origin for the atmosphere.

Table depicting similarities between volcanic gases and reservoirs:

|Species |	Volcanic gases (%) |	*Near Surface Reservoirs |
|:------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|H2O |	83 |	87 |
|CO2 	|12 |	12 |

As a part of my degree I would like to say that I have studied numerous studies and am fully capable of assessing scientific papers on the subject in question. The fact is that a number of the issues have *not* been refuted by any convincing means by the Firestone et al consortium, or have been entirely ignored all together. 

What pissing match? It's not a pissing match, or some sort of conspiracy against their hypothesis, it's science. So far they simply haven't been able to aggregate evidence that is either credible, refrain from questionable methodology, or in some cases even generate reproducible data! What is expected here is unbiased views... something you clearly lack. The evidence *against* Firestone et al from the scientific community is tremendous and for some reason you simply won't accept that. What would be nice is if supporters of this hypothesis weren't blinded by their own self motivations, and fantasies.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I'm aware, a diamond anvil cell is the only method which can generate such high pressures; however, I'm unaware of the upper limits with regard to the experimental constraints for various setups. That being said, given that [the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_anvil_cell) claims capabilities upwards of 600GPa (0.6TPa) I doubt it's currently possible as the study states pressures from 0.51TPa to 2.95TPa. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a number of uncertainties with regard to plate tectonics, and while we have a reasonable knowledge base within the constraints of Earth like plate tectonics there are a lot of assumptions that may or may not be justifiable the further one migrates away from an Earth like mass. It is typically argued that, at least on planets with masses equal to that of Earth, [water is a requirement](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm) for the process of plate tectonics to be initiated and sustained. While some authors argue in favour of this:

At least in the simplest case, factors other than planet size, such as the presence of surface water, are likely most important for determining the presence or absence of plate tectonics. - Plate tectonics on super-Earths: Equally or more likely than on Earth ([pdf](http://jupiter.ethz.ch/~pjt/papers/vanHeck2011PEPI_SuperEarths.pdf))

Others do not when it comes to super-Earths:

Moreover, uncertainties in achieving plate tectonics in the [1 Earth mass] regime disappear as mass increases: super-Earths, even if dry, will exhibit plate tectonic behavior. - Inevitability of Plate Tectonics on Super-Earths ([pdf](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~sasselov/exopl/tectonics.pdf))

In the abstract you refer to the authors suggest that higher pressures increase viscosity to such a degree that mantle convection would be extremely sluggish. They further argue that the increased temperatures and pressures would also be unfavourable for ascending plumes. When something is bouyant it rises, when it's negatively bouyant it sinks and when it's neutral it stagnates. Here the authors suggest that "ascending plumes lose their buoyancy on their way and hardly reach the surface boundary." All of this leads to a thicker crust with unfavourable conditions for Earth like plate tectonics on super-Earths. As the authors note in an article:

Earths tectonic plates are driven by a conveyor belt of sinking and rising rock. Previous studies had predicted that the extra heat inside super-Earths would easily power similar movement.

Those studies, however, adapted previously created simulations of Earths internal movements. The studies did not consider the changes that come with a bigger planet, Miyagoshi says. Larger planets put more pressure on their interiors. That boosts temperatures at lower depths. And it changes how rocks and magma  liquid rock  move through the planet.

Miyagoshi and his colleagues simulated a planet with 10 times Earths mass. Blobs of cold rock descended into the simulated interior. Then, rising pressures heated the rock and stalled its fall. Similarly, rising plumes of magma cooled and slowed as they climbed toward the surface. This lethargic movement created a stagnant shell around the planet that was roughly 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) thick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We still need to research what exactly is sustaining our own magnetic field though and what our Earth's core is even composed of.

We actually have some fairly good constraints on those two areas of research with any new discoveries likely to result in minor component adjustments or slight refinements to the overall theories. For example our magnetic field is a self-sustaining geodynamo explained (in a previous comment of mine) as follows:

___

It's a theory, but a good theory based on some simple physics. I'll try to re-hash some old notes to help explain it:

######Earth's Magnetic Field:

Earth's magnetic field ([MF](http://portugalmundial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dynamos_magfield.jpg)) can be approximated (90%) by a dipole (bar magnet) with the MF oriented ~11 from the rotational poles. However, the MF is not due to permanent magnetism since the Earth's interior is far too hot (600C) to retain magnetization, therefore, it must be induced by electric current flow.

######Source of MF:

The MF is believed to be generated by thermally-driven convection currents in the fluid outer-core (electrically conductive molten iron) producing [a self-exciting dynamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory), with axial symmetry imposed by Earth's rotation. The study of which is called [Magnetohydrodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Geophysics) (combining electricity, magnetism, fluid dynamics, and heat flow). Mechanical models of self-exciting magnetic dynamos can be built as an analogy of Earth's MF.

######Faraday Disc:

(1) Consider a conducting disc rotating in an external MF. Negative charges accumulate at the rim, and positive charges accumulate at the axis due to the [Lorenz Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force). ([see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/7aRrhO6.png))

(2) The disc is connected to the axis with a conductive wire that allows current to flow (direction is that of positive charges by convention). The current flow in the loop induces a MF given by the right-hand-rule (RHR - point your thumb of your right hand along the current flow, when you curl your fingers it will be in the direction of induced MF). The current flow induced by the external MF induces a secondary MF in the same direction as the external MF, reinforcing the MF, inducing more current (positive feedback - [see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/K3oElCE.jpg)). A small transient MF can be amplified and lead to a self-sustaining MF, with the energy coming from rotation.

The controversy comes in the form of the transient MF, as the theory doesn't explain that aspect, it just notes that one is required. Essentially you have the following explanation:

For magnetic field generation to occur several conditions must be met: 1. there must be a conducting fluid; 2. there must be enough energy to cause the fluid to move with sufficient speed and with the appropriate flow pattern; 3. there must be a seed magnetic field (transient MF) There is sufficient energy in the outer core to drive convection, and coupled with the Earths rotation, produce the appropriate flow pattern. The existing field of the Sun acts as the seed field. As a stream of molten iron passes through the existing magnetic field of the Sun, an electric current is generated, and the newly created electric field will in turn create a magnetic field.

<TEXT> Though the vast majority of reported incidences are due to waste water injection reactivating faults, there are recorded events attributed to the hydraulic fracturing itself and not waste water injection - though they are less common. The problem is likely due to poor survey methods. There are a large number of companies that simply do not complete adequate geophysical surveys in order to locate documented and undocumented faults systems. The process needs tighter regulations to reduce the chances of activating these faults.

EDIT: For those looking for quality information on the issue the USGS does [monthly public lectures](http://online.wr.usgs.gov/calendar/archives.html). In August of 2015, Justin Rubinstein, a USGS Research Geophysicist presented his lecture: [Yes, Humans Really Are Causing Earthquakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9P2OgTNiY8) which I would recommend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not familiar with the geology of the region, but I would say that it seems reasonable that there may exist more "bluestone," however, it may be extremely difficult to locate. Bluetsone is an unbelievably ambiguous name, meaning anything from spotted dolerite, unspotted dolerite, to rhyolite, [etc](http://brian-mountainman.blogspot.ca/2010/11/more-than-30-different-bluestone.html). Approx. [55%](http://www.livescience.com/43578-source-stonehenge-rocks-pinpointed.html) of the dolerite stones come from [Carn Goedog](http://i.livescience.com/images/i/000/062/877/original/stonehenge-rocks.jpg?1393017719), a relatively small outcrop. The glacial history is important, advances and retreats, as they all describe times of deposition and erosion. It seems entirely reasonable that should such small outcrops be "[plucked](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53109b11e4b05040160f0a8f/t/55fbcf48e4b04c74c5055c48/1442565963803/)," and subsequently transported that their deposition would include burial under thick(?) till blankets. So a small initial contribution from a small outcrop - transported hundreds of kilometers down ice, deposited synchronously with other till deposits and subsequently blanketed by later glacial drift (ie. glacial outwash, etc.) - would certainly be difficult to located the entire debris train from point to source. [Ice flow indicators](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FraUxsnCivU/TU1bFaFbF5I/AAAAAAAAAtk/kAF_51bDgJ4/s1600/GBG+map.jpg) certainly add weight to the claim though. </TEXT>

For example, Cere's has Ammonia ice... the presence of which suggests that it may have migrated to its current position in the asteroid belt as it's too warm for ammonia ice to exist on Ceres today, it would have evaporated. 

Carbonaceous chondrites *D/H ratios* don't tell us about the abundance of water present, but rather just the '[finger print](http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/4e/ESA_Rosetta_ROSINA_DH_ratio.jpg).'

<TEXT> So initially it can rise through the mantle (deep Earth) because it is less dense than the surrounding mantle, similar to how a [lava lamp works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL3Ez9bxMTo). But when it reaches the upper mantle / lower crust, it's like the wax in the lava lamp reaching the top... there's no where to go. But as it 'sits' there it warms up the surrounding rock. When things warm up they tend to expand which can also create cracks, like the cracks that can form in a pie crust as it cooks in the oven. But, once a crack is formed, the magma under high pressure now has a pathway to move up again created by the drop in pressure - similar to removing the cap on a shaken bottle of pop - the drop in surrounding pressure allows the high pressure stuff to rise up.

If those are too costly, perhaps they would make a good future investment or you can find them online as pdf's, or e-books. In the mean time, there are also plenty of field guides, [for example](http://www.amazon.ca/Sedimentary-Rocks-Field-Colour-Guide/dp/1874545693) that may interest you, or even  that you can [print out](http://www.pdac.ca/docs/default-source/publications---news-activities/060220-pebble-guide.pdf?sfvrsn=3) (pdf) for basic identification. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Remember that in order for the lava to get to the surface in the first place it had to literally move mountains.

Mmm, not quite. Hawaii's volcanism (and others) is derived from a mantle plume originating [from the core mantle boundary](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v525/n7567/fig_tab/nature14876_F3.html) (CMB). It rises up through the mantle due to contrasting densities (it's positively buoyant). Once it reaches the crust it will rise through a process known as [stoping](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/journalimages/GEOCAN/2006/Vol_33/No_04/geocan33_4ser01_fig7.jpg). Thermal expansion, due to the intruding magma, causes the surrounding country rock to deform. Increases in pressure can produce [fractures](http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/images/stoping.gif), creating a drop in pressure in which the magma will now inject itself forming '[dykes](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140211/ncomms4272/images/ncomms4272-f3.jpg)' until it breaches the surface. [Here](http://www.fccj.us/vocabulary/Tarbuck/Chapter9/09_22A.jpg) is a good overall diagram depicting features associated with the process, and the following is one of the more famous examples in outcrop...[Ship Rock, New Mexico](http://geoscience.wisc.edu/~maher/air/113-19v.jpg).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> We do. These studies suggest that there exists a region below the 660 discontinuity in which there is a substantial increase in viscosity which lies at ~1000km depth.

Abstract

The viscosity structure of Earths deep mantle affects the thermal evolution of Earth, the ascent of mantle plumes, settling of subducted oceanic lithosphere, and the mixing of compositional heterogeneities in the mantle. Based on a reanalysis of the long-wavelength nonhydrostatic geoid, we infer viscous layering of the mantle using a method that allows us to avoid a priori assumptions about its variation with depth. We detect an increase in viscosity at 800- to 1200-kilometers depth, far greater than the depth of the mineral phase transformations that define the mantle transition zone. The viscosity increase is coincident in depth with regions where seismic tomography has imaged slab stagnation, plume deflection, and changes in large-scale structure and offers a simple explanation of these phenomena.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's the likelihood of people being warned about one of these if it would hit the Earth? 

Near certainty. Doing geophysical surveys (proton precession magnetometer survey for example) we need to calibrate a base station to Earth's magnetic field in the local area of the survey. That way we can subtract it from the geophysical ground survey which will then highlight the anomalies generated by the rocks / ore bodies. However, we need to check the weather first - [the space weather](http://www.spaceweather.com/) that is - as any large fluctuations will generate too much noise, rendering the survey essentially useless and potentially wasting the day (time and money, and every ones efforts). </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, many huge slabs of ocean crust that have been dragged down, or subducted, into the mantle can still be seen in the deep Earth.

For anyone curious about how we see the slabs, it's through methods such as seismic tomography, correlating the speeds of seismic waves to different densities. Colder objects (such as rigid, older negatively bouyant oceanic lithosphere) tend to be more dense than hotter objects (such as weak, hot partially melted asthenosphere) and so seismic waves will travel more quickly through these regions. Resolution decreases with depth so the deeper you penetrate the more uncertain your results become. The following set of images highlight this method of analysis: ([A](http://epsc.wustl.edu/seismology/LABATTS/research_figs/cross.gif)) ([B](http://www.mantleplumes.org/images3/SeisProbFig3_550.jpg)). Image A clearly shows the discontinuity at [660km](http://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/images/geophysik/seismologie/bilder/wavevelocities1d.bmp) depth by the clustering of hypocentres as the plate buckles and flexes (the 660 transition zone acts as a boundary, unlike the one [located at 410](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_zone_%28Earth%29) which acts as a mechanism to pull the slab further down - one of the main components behind plate tectonics).  </TEXT>

Purely speculating, without extensive knowledge of the outcrop itself, I would hazard a guess the dikes provided the heat and along with [infiltration of sea water](http://www.geol.umd.edu/~piccoli/100/Image185.jpg) the rocks were heavily oxidized through the subsequent alteration reactions. These could later be more readily weathered than other regions of the outcrop due to compositional differences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a special place in the heart of geologists for Pliny the Younger, especially those with a focus in volcanology. The following is a description regarding a specific type of volcanic eruption:
___

**Plinian eruptions**:

Events such as the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens in Washington State, USA are typical of Plinian eruptions. These eruptions were named after Pliny the Younger who wrote an account of the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius which destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. In eruptions of this kind a jet of gas and magma clasts emerges from the vent at speeds of 100600 m s^1 and forms a convecting eruption plume in the atmosphere as the surrounding air is sucked into the jet. Clasts are carried upwards and progressively fall out from the eruption plume. Large clasts are carried upwards only a short distance and fall to the ground close to the vent, while smaller clasts are carried to greater heights and fall out further from the vent, forming part of an unconsolidated airfall deposit. The eruptions are sustained, and can last for hours or days. Eruptions exhibiting this style of activity are subdivided into [sub-Plinian, Plinian, and ultra-Plinian](https://imgur.com/Ropagag) based on their mass flux and plume heights (factors which are linked). Mass fluxes across the three subtypes range from 106 to 109 kg s^1, rates which are generally greatly in excess of those for recent basaltic eruptions. Mass fluxes during recent eruptions at Kilauea are  105 kg s^1 , whereas the highest mass flux during the (exceptional) Laki eruption was 107 kg s^1 . Generally, Plinian eruptions involve magmas which are relatively rich in silica and in dissolved gases, are very viscous, and erupt at lower temperatures than basalts. They are the products of various kinds of interaction of more basaltic melts with other rocks in the crust. The commonest magma types involved in Plinian eruptions are called dacites and rhyolites, but rare basaltic Plinian eruptions are known. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Certainly not an expert on it, I'm not a geophysicist, but I feel confident I understand the basics of the "controversy" if it can rightly be called that.  

It's a theory, but a good theory based on some simple physics. I'll try to re-hash some old notes to help explain it:

######Earth's Magnetic Field:

Earth's magnetic field ([MF](http://portugalmundial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dynamos_magfield.jpg)) can be approximated (90%) by a dipole (bar magnet) with the MF oriented ~11 from the rotational poles. However, the MF is not due to permanent magnetism since the Earth's interior is far too hot (600C) to retain magnetization, therefore, it must be induced by electric current flow.

######Source of MF:

The MF is believed to be generated by thermally-driven convection currents in the fluid outer-core (electrically conductive molten iron) producing [a self-exciting dynamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory), with axial symmetry imposed by Earth's rotation. The study of which is called [Magnetohydrodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Geophysics) (combining electricity, magnetism, fluid dynamics, and heat flow). Mechanical models of self-exciting magnetic dynamos can be built as an analogy of Earth's MF.

######Faraday Disc:

(1) Consider a conducting disc rotating in an external MF. Negative charges accumulate at the rim, and positive charges accumulate at the axis due to the [Lorenz Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force). ([see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/7aRrhO6.png))

(2) The disc is connected to the axis with a conductive wire that allows current to flow (direction is that of positive charges by convention). The current flow in the loop induces a MF given by the right-hand-rule (RHR - point your thumb of your right hand along the current flow, when you curl your fingers it will be in the direction of induced MF). The current flow induced by the external MF induces a secondary MF in the same direction as the external MF, reinforcing the MF, inducing more current (positive feedback - [see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/K3oElCE.jpg)). A small transient MF can be amplified and lead to a self-sustaining MF, with the energy coming from rotation.

If you're interested further, or simply looking for further clarity and have some time to kill do a search for 'Nova - Magnetic Storm.' It's nothing technical but it does explore the subject of reversals.

The controversy comes in the form of the transient MF, as the theory doesn't explain that aspect, it just notes that one is required. Essentially you have the following explanation:

For magnetic field generation to occur several conditions must be met: 1. there must be a conducting fluid; 2. there must be enough energy to cause the fluid to move with sufficient speed and with the appropriate flow pattern; 3. there must be a seed magnetic field (transient MF) There is sufficient energy in the outer core to drive convection, and coupled with the Earths rotation, produce the appropriate flow pattern. The existing field of the Sun acts as the seed field. As a stream of molten iron passes through the existing magnetic field of the Sun, an electric current is generated, and the newly created electric field will in turn create a magnetic field. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a great question. I'm relatively new to Scotch myself so I can't really suggest too many. Currently, being drawn to the distilleries of Islay, I'm trying to taste a "classic" from each one. Lagavulin 16 is an excellent choice in my books, and there's nothing wrong with picking up another bottle. If you're looking to take it up a notch though, I would recommend sitting in on a tasting event or looking for a [whisky house](http://www.shebeen.ca/whiskey-list.pdf) (pdf) where you can sample a good variety. That, or perhaps a pub with a decent whisky list as well.

Really though, I hesitate to recommend one in particular as they each have their own occasion. I absolutely enjoy filling my hip flask with Talisker 10 for an autumn hike or winter camping. The long finish warms you up nicely, while others are great for other occasions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's so much variety it really depends on your tastes. There are plenty of good whiskys out there from single malt (a single distillery) to blended (more than one whisky from multiple distilleries blended together). I won't speak for whisky/ey outside of Scotland (Scotch) though there are plenty of good options as already mentioned (such as [Balcones Texas Single Malt](https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/balcones/balcones-texas-single-malt-whisky/)). Take a look [this chart](https://www.forwhiskeylovers.com/sites/default/files/user/20168/photos/Scotch%20chart.jpg) to find something you think you might enjoy. Single malts tend to be reflective of the area for which they originate in. For example, distilleries on [Islay](http://blog.fxdurkin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/whiskymap.jpg) didn't have access to coal like the Low Lands and other regions of Scotland did, so they used peat during their malting process which imbues a degree of smokiness to Scotches originating from Islay. To get a sense of the whole process for single malt Scotch, check out the [Laphroaig Distillery Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Xo900woaU). 

I have yet to try any Scotch from Highland Park, but I would recommend that distillery. As is stated in *Michael Jackson's Complete Guide to Single Malt Scotch*, "Highland Park is the greatest all-rounder in the world of malt whisky"   

My journey into Scotch began with Jura Superstition, and I was hooked on peated Scotch. From there I delved into a quest for more smoke, Talisker 10, Ardbeg 10, Lagavulin 16, Laphroaig 18, etc. exploring the Scotches from Islay. I've had Speysides and others as well, but for me I'm drawn to peated Scotches with heavy smoke. You'll find a Scotch for each event as well - one to enjoy with a book, one to enjoy on a cold winters day at the top of your hike, and so on.

Generally speaking, you may find the 100 point system to also be helpful. A summary of what the numbers actually mean can be [found here](http://thewhiskeyjug.com/how-to-score-whiskey/)

<TEXT> From a paleobioloigcal reference some species of coccolithophore would seem to do well in warmer waters under higher atmospheric CO2. EHUX ([Emiliania huxleyi](http://ina.tmsoc.org/Nannotax3/index.php?dir=Coccolithophores/Isochrysidales/Noelaerhabdaceae/Emiliania/Emiliania%20huxleyi)), one species of coccolithophores, thrived during the Cretaceous (with means of ~18C and 1700ppm CO2) eventually depositing the White Cliffs of Dover, iirc. It's important to note that there are cold and warm water tolerant species of coccolithophores as well. 

[Gephyrocapsa Muellerae](http://ina.tmsoc.org/Nannotax3/index.php?dir=Coccolithophores/Isochrysidales/Noelaerhabdaceae/Gephyrocapsa/Gephyrocapsa%20muellerae) is a relatively cold water species of coccolithophore and the transition between cold-water and warm-water tolerant species is frequently studied in order to understand cold and warm events throughout the geological record, such as between glacial and interglacial episodes, [Marine Isotope Stages](https://chriscolose.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/epicacore1.jpg) (MIS), for reconstructing paleoclimate records. </TEXT>

(2) End Devonian - No clear trigger, though the 'fart cloud' you see is actually the wide spread evolution of plants, and the subsequent 'greening' of the continents.

(3) End Permian - [The Siberian Traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Traps)

(4) End Triassic - The onset of the breakup of the super continent Pangea. Climate change / volcanism.

(5) End Cretaceous - debated, though similarly to previous extinctions volcanism (Deccan Traps) likely played a role along with the bolide impact, which btw had nothing to do with the formation of the [Gulf of Mexico](http://www.lecosmographe.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Chicxulub-Crater.jpg). </TEXT>

<TEXT> While compositional similarities certainly provide good evidence in regard to orogenic relationships that method of analysis is extremely limited to episodes of, well, orogensis. I would argue that when it comes to paleogeography the two biggest ones are actually a) as you've mentioned - fossils, and b) [Paleomagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleomagnetism) which is able to place better constraints on latitudinal positions. For example, while orogenic relationships may indicate active / passive margins, it can't tell you where on the globe it's occurring. For that, you need paleomagnetism, and other linkages such as fossil indicators.

Compositional analysis is typically used to tell you *what* is going on at a certain time (uplift, subduction, extension, subsidence, transgression / regression, etc.) rather than *where* on the globe it's occurring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well for one, I certainly care. I can study their formation, and their history can reveal important aspects in regards to earth processes throughout the geological record and how those processes may have changed over time. Understanding the processes that govern the formation of natural diamonds can also shed light on where to look, not only for more, but for related geological processes - which in turn can reveal aspects in regard to those indirect processes related to diamonds. Turn the question around, and ask what each individual synthetic diamond can tell you about the world around you...  

Besides the knowledge gained through the exploration, and discovery of natural diamonds there certainly is something special about their history. When you have an appreciation for evolutionary processes you might appreciate the processes that it took to form them under natural conditions. Who cares then, for the rare and exotic species of flower when you can just make synthetic flowers and place them in a vase, who cares about collecting iron meteorites - originating from planetary cores of planetesimals, broken apart that now reside on someones shelf, when you could just have some iron slag instead. Who cares about the original works of Leonardo Da Vinci, Vincent Van Gogh, Monet, Picasso and Caravaggio when you can just have prints. With a superficial understanding comes a superficial appreciation, only with a deeper understanding can a true appreciation arise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...reduction over time of radioactive decay in the core?

Relative to the crust and the mantle, radioactivity from a planets core is negligible. Earth's heat is derived from (1) the accretion process, and impacts (formation of the Earth) (2) the [iron catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_catastrophe) and (3) radioactive decay 

Expanded on elsewhere:
There are three possible sources of heat in a planet's interior. One is the heat of accretion during its formation---dust, pebbles, and rocks stuck together as they were gravitationally attracted together in the planet's formation, releasing gravitational potential energy. A second source is during differentiation---loss of gravitational potential energy as the denser material sunk to the core. Both of those sources occur early in a planet's history. The primary source today, billions of years later, is the heat from radioactive decay of unstable atomic nuclei: uranium-238, uranium-235, thorium-232, and potassium-40.

Over time heat is lost to space and the planet cools. This process leads to the evolution of the planet and eventually the cessation of geological activity - though this takes a considerable amount of time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issues arise, most likely, from estimates of total water content to begin with and I suspect from improper assumptions in thermodynamic modelling of the system. I understand the intuitive reasoning behind the theories; however, some evidence simply doesn't align with those intuitive reasons. The reasoning can be summarized as follows:

During Earth's formation temperatures should have lead to the Earth existing essentially as a 'magma ocean.' Outgassing from volcanism would have given rise to Earth's first or primary atmosphere. Following this, the giant impactor, leading to the subsequent formation of our moon, should also have given rise to a magma ocean. This would have boiled off Earth's oceans and lead to the creation of a 'dry' moon. The Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) along with volcanic outgassing would have given rise to Earth's secondary atmospheric composition. Much of this, however, is debated including Earth's early magma oceans.

Some theorize that the majority of Earth's water must have been delivered by comets during the LHB, while others insist it was delivered by asteroids (carbonaceous chondrites - CC) - the latter of which is strongly supported by the evidence. Personally, I dismiss the cometary theory as it currently stands. There's simply not enough evidence to support such a position in comparison to delivery by CC's. Volcanic degassing has always been a favourite of mine though there remain a large number of unanswered questions that remain to be modeled with a high degree of certainty. For example, what is the rate of volcanic degassing, and has it changed over time? Have the reservoirs remained constant over time or have they mixed and if they have mixed how well did they mix? How much water is present in the Earth's mantle, how well does it mix, at what rate does it mix, has that rate changed over time and what do these variables depend on and have those dependencies varied through time? These all give rise to further, more in depth questions that remain speculative and will no doubt evolve with more evidence. For example, the moon - once thought to have accreted 'dry' is actually fairly 'wet.' What then are the implications for the Earth's deep reservoirs?

The answer of where Earth's current reservoirs are derived from is thus anything but intuitive, and quite a complex question to confidently answer with supportive evidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Out of the current evidence, [carbonaceous chondrites](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater) have remained the strongly favoured mechanism for delivering Earth's water with a further component derived from volcanic degassing. The cometary explanation for the origin of Earth's water, while tempting to contemplate, has seen little, if any, good evidence in support of the theory. In fact, the vast majority of evidence thus far [points away from cometary sources](http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/12/First_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio). Interestingly, [another study](http://www.nature.com/news/earth-has-water-older-than-the-sun-1.16011) has suggested that a considerable portion of the H2O within our solar system is likely older than our Sun - though this says little in regard to the aforementioned competing theories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a good question, and to be honest one I that I don't believe there is a definitive answer to yet. We still don't know when our present style of plate tectonics was initiated with good confidence and nor do we know exactly how the process began with good confidence. There certainly are theories but there is a fair amount of debate, back-and-forth, between them.

<TEXT> The study you linked does not affirm your statement that Mars currently lacks active plate tectonics. If I recall correctly, the lead author suggests that there may be active plate tectonics occurring on Mars today, that it may be different from Earth's, and that if it is occurring it is occurring on much slower time scales.

Mars is at a primitive stage of plate tectonics. It gives us a glimpse of how the early Earth may have looked and may help us understand how plate tectonics began on Earth," said An Yin, a UCLA professor of Earth and space sciences and the sole author of the new research...

I don't quite understand why the plates are moving with such a large magnitude or what the rate of movement is; maybe Mars has a different form of plate tectonics," Yin said. "The rate is much slower than on Earth. - [UCLA Article](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-scientist-discovers-plate-237303)

<TEXT> It most certainly will. Plate tectonics is driven primarily by positive and negative contrasts in buoyancy (density) that ultimately give rise to convective flow. Thus, we can infer that once the planet cools enough these processes will stop. Think of a lava lamp, for example, and what drives the motion within it (essentially differences in temperature) and now think of what happens when you turn the lava lamp off and the internal temperature cools and reaches the surrounding room temperature... convection stops. 

However, I would predict that plate tectonics will stop well before the Earth cools down that much, and will stop when the oceans are lost due to the continued increase in solar luminosity ~1.1Ga from present. [Water is a requirement for plate tectonics](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm) so far as we understand the process on Earth. </TEXT>

If it's a live fish, it's going to be moving and with 25s of movement you'll be lucky if you can recognize the forms. If it's a decaying fish like in the forefront I fail to see how you would have a difficult time recognizing that it was in fact a decaying salmon. Perhaps you're not accustomed to such environments? 

As for the watermark - that's pretty standard, and if anyone is interested in the image it can be removed as need be.

<TEXT> Geologist here, will attempt to simplify for you. There are 3 main [carbon isotopes](http://iws.collin.edu/biopage/faculty/mcculloch/1408/notes/chemistry/images/02-04T-IsotopesOfCarbon.gif) that are typically used for analysis. When looking at stable isotopes (isotopes that don't decay, i.e. non radioactive) we can use ^12 C and ^13 C. ^13 C has 1 more neutron than ^12 C thus making it heavier than ^12 C so it moves slower - thus the rate at which ^12 C encounters an organism will occur more frequently than ^13 C. A few key metabolic enzymes can be quite finicky, presumably because of the mass, and so will 'prefer' ^12 C over ^13 C. This means then that life will be isotopically 'light' relative to the natural atmospheric composition. We can see this in the following table:



Type of organism | 13C value
---|---
C4 photosynthetic plants | -13
C3 photosynthetic plants | -28
Thermal vent microorganisms | -33



The formula for 13C can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9413C) and essentially means that when the 13C value is reported as being positive (+) it has higher amounts of the heavier isotope, in this case ^13 C in it and is therefore isotopically heavy. When the 13C value is reported as being negative (-) it means it has smaller amounts of ^13 C and is therefore isotopically light. Low values of 13C is another way of saying it is isotopically light. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello micromonas, 

Earlier in my education I compiled a report reviewing a paper similar to this paper, titled "[Early life recorded in Archean pillow lavas](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/304/5670/578)." Their arguments were certainly supportive of their interpretation; however, they also had microtextures lined with low 13C values (these are used today as being indicative of microbial life in modern basalts and ophiolites). As far as I can see from the article (not the paper itself) I would have to agree that having low 13C values within zircon is not nearly a strong enough line of evidence to definitely conclude the presence of life. That being said, we know life is older than 3.5Ga presented by the fossil record - while tantalizing, however, I remain skeptical of this teams interpretation.

<TEXT> Nate Silver doesn't have a background regarding geological studies. It's quite well known / established (especially for areas such as the Pacific Northwest) that EQs do not follow the straight line predicted by the [GutenbergRichter law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg%E2%80%93Richter_law) - deviation from the GR law is the norm. The importance of the UCERF3 model is that it more accurately reflects complex fault systems. The following is from the abstract, though I would recommend the paper itself:

This is because of the inclusion of multifault ruptures, where earthquakes are no longer confined to separate, individual faults, but can occasionally rupture multiple faults simultaneously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up on the coast of the Pacific Northwest, not too far north, but north enough (about the 54^th parallel). During the fall and winter months we would have shows, almost nightly. Some of my fondest memories are as a young teenager - I used to sneak out of my parents house, and walk over to my girlfriends at the time. On my return home, in the early hours of the morning, the air would be crisp, fresh snow on the ground, and everything was silent but for the sound of my steps and the occasional winter breeze that would meander its way through the snow covered branches of the nearby trees. Looking up into the night sky, stretching from horizon to horizon would be the norther lights - dancing about like curtains, light and dark greens, hues of purple and red as if to hide the stars that flickered behind them.

<TEXT> Even for a family of cometary objects to reduce luminosity by 22% seems unlikely. To add some perspective:

Straight away, we know were not dealing with a planet here. Even a Jupiter-sized planet only blocks roughly 1 percent of this kind of stars light, and thats about as big as a planet gets. It cant be due to a star, either; wed see it if it were. And the lack of a regular, repeating signal belies both of these as well. Whatever is blocking the star is big, though, up to half the width of the star itself! - [source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/10/14/weird_star_strange_dips_in_brightness_are_a_bit_baffling.html)

Anything in a well defined orbit, I would suspect would also have a definite periodicity to it; however, that's not the case:

...it turns out there are lots of these dips in the stars light. Hundreds. And they dont seem to be periodic at all. They have odd shapes to them, too. A planet blocking a stars light will have a generally symmetric dip; the light fades a little, remains steady at that level, then goes back up later. The dip at 800 days in the KIC 8462852 data doesnt do that; it drops slowly, then rises more rapidly. Another one at 1,500 days has a series of blips up and down inside the main dips. Theres also an apparent change in brightness that seems to go up and down roughly every 20 days for weeks, then disappears completely. Its likely just random transits, but still. Its bizarre.

What ever we're observing, it's fascinating to say the least. </TEXT>

Therefore, this sample - dating between 80,000ka - 120,000ka could not have used radiocarbon dating. You could date layers above and below the layer containing the teeth to constrain the dates using other radiometric dating techniques (as was the case here), though caution must be taken in order to ensure that no [re-working](https://vmnhpaleontology.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/reworked-fossils-part-1/) has occurred. </TEXT>

**Common Myths and Misconceptions**

Q: Can small EQ's relieve stress to prevent large ones?

A: If you look at earthquake statistics in most regions of the world, including California, you will find that for every magnitude 5 earthquake, there are about 10 that have a magnitude of 4, and for each magnitude 4, there are 10 with magnitude 3. Unfortunately, this means there are not enough small earthquakes to relieve enough stress to prevent the large events. In fact, it would take 32 magnitude 5's, 1000 magnitude 4's, or 32,000 magnitude 3's to equal the energy produced in one magnitude 6 event.

<TEXT> To help refine your theory allow me make a few corrections with regard to detail, for the sake of clarity:

(1) Venus' retrograde motion is thought to have originated from a giant impact, much like Earth and [Theia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_%28planet%29).

(2) The resurfacing of Venus some 500Ma is, as one theory suggests, due to the fact that Venus lacks plate tectonics ([no water](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm)), and so has a 'stagnant-lid.' Without an active lithosphere heat must accumulate, eventually leading to catastrophic overturning of the mantle and subsequently resurfacing of Venus ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodynamics_of_Venus#Episodic_plate_tectonics)).  

(3) Convection within Venus doesn't seem to be an issue, however, Venus' rotation is thought to be too slow to support a self sustaining geodynamo like that of Earth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Will it lose a significant amount of surface matter this way?

That depends on what's going on at the surface, and currently no one is certain. The following is an excerpt from an interview with Michael Brown, Cathy Olkin, and Richard Binzel.

*Zooming out from Pluto's surface to the atmosphere, New Horizons has revealed that Pluto is rapidly losing its atmosphere out to space because of its weak gravity. Yet Pluto has somehow maintained an atmosphere. How?*

Cathy Olkin: Pluto's atmosphere is really large and extended, and you would expect that it would be escaping. So it has to be regenerated somehow. Those ices on the surface that we were talking aboutthey'll sublimate and go from the solid form into a gaseous form, and then support the atmosphere. Of course over millions of years, you'll have to have some source for resupply. There was a recent paper by Kelsi Singer and Alan Stern about potential sources of replenishing the nitrogen ice, which is the main predominant gas in the atmosphere. That paper proposed maybe there were sources internal to Pluto that were upwelling and providing ices coming up from the subsurface to the surface. Then that would sublimate and support that atmosphere. So that's one theory for what's supporting the atmosphere.

Michael Brown: Can I mention a more mundane potential explanation, which is what we thought for most of the past decade? We wrote a paper a few years ago suggesting that if you just had all these ices there to begin with at the abundances that we know exists in say, comets, that the loss rates on Pluto are such that you would still have the atmosphere there. So, I'm not convinced yet that the atmosphere needs replenishment through some sort of active mechanism. And one of the ways that we sort of show ourselves that we understand this process is by looking at all of the other objects out there in that region of the Kuiper Belt. The largest ones, which had the biggest inventories to begin with, still have those ices on them. They have the methane. They probably have the nitrogen and carbon monoxide. We can't see those as well and as you get just a little bit smaller where they should have lost all of them to space, they don't have them. So, it's not clear to me that active rejuvenation is actually necessary.

Richard Binzel: I think what's going on there at Pluto is some of these seasonal effects. You have to realize Pluto's in this eccentric orbit and so it goes as close to the sun as 30 AU and as far as 50 AU. [An "AU," or astronomical unit, is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun.] So you could have times when it's unseasonably warm on Pluto and it gets up to 60 Kelvin [-352 Fahrenheit] or so. So you can expect that there are times when it's warmer and that some of the more volatile ices will go from the solid phase to the gas phase. And I think historically over time, just depending on what you think about loss rates, maybe Pluto's lost a few kilometers of its upper layers. So, it's not like all of Pluto evaporated. There are these other things going on, not only Pluto's eccentric orbit. Pluto is tipped over in its orbit too, so there are some times when one of the poles is pointing Sun-on. Then Pluto has these century-long arctic summers, and that can be driving a lot of volatiles from the solid phase to the gas phase. There's just a lot of complexity at Pluto that is just fantastic to try to unravel.

Michael Brown: I actually think that Rick's point is the key point that didn't get discussed very much during the flyby. Pluto is the most seasonally extreme world I think we've ever visited. So our instincts on what should and shouldn't be there are often not very good. We need to really think about the seasonswhat season it is right now, what season it's just been and think about how all these ices move around and how everything moves around because of these seasons.

<TEXT> I'll answer two questions posed to help clarify the issue for you. One in summary the other in ... some detail. 

With regard to if we're sure the inner-core is iron (formed during [the iron-catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_catastrophe)), it's bulk composition is iron-nickel with other elements scattered throughout though they are certainly not a major component relative to nickel and iron. We understand this through modelling, laboratory experimentation, and probing by means of geophysical or seismic surveys.

With regard to your question about heavier elements, radioactive elements, etc. it's not *just* about the mass of an element, and actually relates to geochemistry, and how said properties distribute elements throughout the Earth's core, mantle, and crust. In order to understand this we need to understand some factors that dictate the process of crystallization (because the process of cooling is, for all intents and purposes, crystallizing).

When material crystallizes it forms bonds, determined by the properties of the elements that compose it, such that it will form what is called a crystal lattice (think of it as a frame work... [NaCl](http://earthsci.org/mineral/rockmin/chart/nacl.gif) for example). When a material cools slowly it has time to reject anything that doesn't fit into the crystal lattice (impurities). This is determined by the ionic radius of the element, and the valence. Potassium for example, is [quite large](http://270c81.medialib.glogster.com/media/46/463184ef720cd5004f107ff944302c4da2cebcf042b133df2134671f35e2eb47/p-table-atomic-rad.jpg), and thus as magma cools and begins to crystallize, it remains in the melt. We note that the hot, K rich melt is less dense than the colder, denser, minerals that just formed and so potassium will rise towards the crust as the melt is positively buoyant. And, in fact we can note that the crust is the most radioactive region of the Earth (K-40 is radioactive) because of how [incompatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_element) these LILE, or large-ion lithophile elements are and the inability to incorporate themselves into common crystal structures (minerals). So while an elements mass is important to some degree, the major player in controlling the distribution of elements throughout the Earth is dominated by the geochemical nature (as is demonstrated in [The Earth Scientist's Periodic Table of the Elements and Their Ions](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/06251711-geochemists-periodic-table.html)).

Gold, by the way (and a few others), should be concentrated deep within the Earth; however, they're not as it has been suggested that they were delivered later [during the Late Heavy Bombardment](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7363/full/nature10399.html). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish I could tell you more, but in all honesty, I have no idea with regards to this specific outcrop. The photo was taken on one of North Arrow Minerals properties (their [Mel Project](http://www.northarrowminerals.com/_resources/projects/mel_map.jpg)), which is located with the Rae Craton, and not by me. From other properties in the area I was able to find a 43-101 that states the regional geology as follows:

The Melville Peninsula lies within the northern part of the Churchill 
Structural Province of the Precambrian Canadian Shield.  It forms a horst between the Foxe Basin and Committee Bay.  The Melville Peninsula is underlain by Archean tonalite-granodiorite 
gneiss, Archean Prince Albert Group metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, Archean granites of the Hall Lake Plutonic Complex, Aphebian Penrhyn Group metasedimentary rocks, Helikian sandstones and conglomerates of the Folster Lake Formation and Fury and Hecla Supergroup, Archean to Proterozoic metadiabase and diabase dykes, and early Paleozoic carbonate rocks. Large areas of the peninsula are covered by Quaternary glacia
l drift (Schau, 1993; Besserer and Olson, 1995). 

The oldest rocks on the Melville Peninsula are partially retrogressed tonalite-granodiorite gneisses, which in some areas are cross-cut by leucogranite dykes and metamorphosed mafic sills and  dykes (Schau, 1993).  Supracrustal rocks of the Prince Albert Group unconformably overlie the gneisses.  The term Prince Albert Group was introduced by Heywood (1967) to "refer to a sequence of Aphebian (early Proterozoic) or Archean metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks", which exist mainly in two belts on the Melville Peninsula and one belt southwest of Committee Bay.  Subsequent geological and isotopic analyses by Frisch and Goulet (1975) and Schau (1975) determined that the Prince Albert Group is, in fact, Archean in age.  Schau (1993) described the Prince Albert Group as "a volcanogenic sequence containing meta-ultramafic rocks, metabasalt, acid volcanic
 rocks, quartzite, banded iron formations, as well as more common pelitic and other clastic metasedimentary rocks".  Small (100 to 400 m diameter) showings of serpentinized ultramafic rock within foliated porphyritic to 
megacrystic granite have been mapped in portions of the Melville Peninsula (Besserer and Olson, 1995).  The Prince Albert Group is exposed in numerous belts and in a few isolated rafts on the Melville Peninsula.  The largest belt is up to 20 km wide and extends from the west-central Melville Peninsula, northeastwards to Roche Bay, th
en strikes northwards past Hall Lake, for a total distance of nearly 200km.  The other belts and rafts of the Prince 
Albert Group rocks are up to 55 km long and 10 km wide (Besserer and Olson, 1995). 

The tonalite-granodiorite gneiss and Prince Albert Group were intruded by Late Archean metagabbroic stocks, then deformed by a complex series of folds and faults, and finally were metamorphosed and intruded by granites 
of the Hall Lake Plutonic Complex. Metamorphism in the Late Archean reached upper amphibolite grade throughout most of Melville Peninsula, but ranged from greenschist grade in a few regions on the east 
coast, through granulite grade in the northwest part of the Peninsula (Besserer and Olson, 1995). 

Metasedimentary rocks of the Penrhyn Group were deposited during the Aphebian (early Proterozoic), mainly in the southern Melville Peninsula.  The Penrhyn Group and underlying basement were subsequently deform
ed in at least two separate episodes associated with the late Aphebian Hudsonian Orogeny, and metamorphosed to amphibolite grade.  Northeast-trending high-strain zones associated with this deformation are present along the contacts between the Penrhyn Group and basement rocks, and at several locations in the north
western Melville Peninsula (Besserer and Olson, 1995). 

The Melville Peninsula was uplifted during the Helikian (middle Proterozoic), and cross-cut by numerous east-southeast trending 'latitudinal faults' (Schau, 1993).  These latitudinal faults occur throughout the Melville Peninsula, but are more common in the north half of the Peninsula.  A few granitic stocks are emplaced 
along these latitudinal  fault zones.  Sandstone and conglomerate clastic sequences were deposited later in the 
Helikian, first in the Folster Lake Formation on the west coast, then in the Fury and Hecla Supergroup on the north coast of Melville Peninsula.  Diabase dykes, of the Mackenzie Series and of the Franklin Series, were intruded into all of the above rock units during the Late Helikian and Hadrynian (Upper Proterozoic).  Ordovician 
carbonate rocks were deposited both on the east coast and adjacent to the west coast of Melville Peninsula, and are the youngest rock units preserved.  Renewed uplift of the Melville Peninsula to near its present erosional surface occurred during the Devonian and Cretaceous.  In the Quaternary, thick glacial sediments were locally deposited along the west coast (Besserer and Olson, 1995).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, the details are contested quite frequently (was it just a giant impact, was it just volcanism, was it both, did the impact trigger volcanism, etc) with similar authors publishing their findings as they develop their theories (note the authors of [this study](http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/early/2015/04/30/B31167.1.full.pdf+html)). To be honest I'm still not convinced of either side (though I lean predominantly in favour of volcanism as the leading culprit). The Deccan Traps came in [three phases](http://www.princeton.edu/main/images/news/2011/11/keller_Fig2deccanpulses_400.jpg) with the largest phase, phase 2 approximately correlating in time with the K-T impact event. 

Perhaps they address the following question in their paper, but one might would expect to see global volcanism increase... did it, if so by how much, and are the same signatures detected in the chemistry globally or can it be attributed to mantle dynamics or something else? Furthermore, if not and they argue that it may have where seismic energy would have been focused we can look at the antipodes and see if in fact they line up (hint: [they don't](http://planetsave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/trompglobes_hires.jpg)).

My point being that given the current evidence there is yet to be a conclusive answer, as the authors themselves note:

Our data don't conclusively prove that the impact caused these changes, but the connection looks increasingly clear. </TEXT>

- Prospective signs of life, one could argue, should be associated with areas in which these briny flows occur. Have any previous studies looked for anomalous CH4 values over time within these areas, and if not will this be an area of future research?

- What are the characteristics of the flows... in other words, do they pool at all - evaporate at different rates along the flow path, and if such is there a detectable gradient in the concentration of perchlorates that could be noted, on larger scales, from orbiters for future target generation?

Thanks for your time </TEXT>

The Mars discovery came out of an independent project he [Lujendra Ojha, an undergraduate at the time] was doing with professor Alfred McEwen, lead author of the new study published in Science. Their collaborator, University of Arizona researcher Colin Dundas, was interested in gullies on Mars, which may be remnants of past water activity. The researchers were looking for seasonal changes in those gullies.

Using a computer algorithm to examine images taken in the same crater as the gullies Dundas had examined, Ojha removed visual distortions, such as shadows, from images of a crater taken at different points in time. With that technique, he compared the images to identify the changes over time.

That's how Ojha noticed irregular features in the crater that weren't related to the gullies. </TEXT>

**Relax the restrictions**

We argue that planetary protection policies can be significantly eased for future Mars missions (Box 1). If Earth microorganisms can thrive on Mars, they almost certainly already do; and if they cannot, the transer of Earth life to Mars should be of no concern, as it would simply not survive. We cannot see how our current program of Mars exploration might pose any real threat to a possible martian biosphere. If we search in situ for extant life on Mars, a cleaning protocol of the spacecraft should be pursued to some extent  but only because we could potentially have problems distinguishing between indigenous Martian organisms (which might be related to Earth life) and microorganisms carried by the spacecraft, and not because of forward contamination concerns. For all other missions, the sterilization requirements as currently delineated by planetary protection protocols can be scaled down.
___
*Box 1 | Assessment of current and future missions to Mars*
___
Currently, all missions to Mars must comply with strict planetary protection policies that are expensive to implement. We make the following specific recommendations for the elimination or reduction of these protocols.

*Orbiters*

MAVEN. NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, scheduled to launch in late 2013, is dedicated to understanding the atmosphere and climate of Mars. No planetary protection measures are required.

ExoMars. Launching in 2016 and led by the European and Russian space agencies, an orbiter will study the atmosphere of Mars and search for gases of possible biological importance, such as methane. No planetary protection measures are required.

*Landers and Rovers*

Mars Exploration Rover. On the martian surface since 2004, NASA's Opportunity rover is still examining clues to past water activity on Mars. With its geologic objectives, no planetary protection measures would have been required.

Mars Science Laboratory. NASA's Curiosity rover touched down in late 2012 and seeks to answer questions regarding the planet's habitability past and present. Curiosity is not, however, directly searching for life and planetary protection measures would not have been required.

InSight. Slated to arrive on the surface of Mars in late 2016, this NASA lander will conduct a geophysical study of the planet's deep interior. No planetary protection measures are required.

ExoMars. Launching with the 2016 orbiter, EDM (Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module) will test landing technologies. It is expected to survive on the surface of Mars for a short time, performing limited surface science. Another rover, along with a surface platform, is planned for a 2018 launch and will search for signs of in situ life. No planetary protection measures are required for EDM, and only limited measures for the rover and the platform to the extent to avoid false positives.

NASA's 2020 rover mission. Planetary protection requirements of this currently unnamed mission will depend on the payload and the final objectives.
___

As planetary exploration faces drastic budget cuts globally, it is critical to avoid unnecessary expenses and reroute the limited taxpayers' money to missions that can have the greatest impact on planetary exploration. We argue that sterilization protocols should be waived for orbiters  despite the risk of a crash or atmospheric re-entry  and surface missions with geological focus, and should be re-evaluated on a case-by-case basis for lander and rover missions that seek to detect past or present life in situ. </TEXT>

**Interplanetary transfer of life**

Significant progress has been made to quantify the survival chances of terrestrial microorganisms during the different stages of a panspermia event in which life is transferred from one planetary body to another. The organisms must survive ejection from the planetary surface following an impact event, the microenvironment inside a rock during the interplanetary trip, and the final descent through an atmosphere to land on another planetary surface. The general consensus is that the process of interplanetary transfer of life is not only possible, but even likely. Terrestrial microorganisms would be able to survive the process of being hurled from their mother body, enduring harsh interplanetary conditions, and finally crashing on to another planet. The argument is particularly viable for the transfer of life from Earth to Mars, because the survival rate is enhanced for re-entry into a thinner atmosphere  such as that of Mars.

In view of these findings, we propose that Earth life has most likely already been transferred to Mars. Life has been present on Earth for at least 3.8 billion years, so there has been plenty of time for the transfer process to occur naturally through impact events. Also, the frequency of impacts was substantially higher in the past than it is today. Even after considering the difficult dynamics of transport from Earth to Mars against the Sun's gravity sink, we can easily conclude that Earth materials have probably been transferred to Mars. The random nature of meteorite impacts across the surface of Mars suggests that any samples containing life from Earth are unlikely to have spared the astrobiologically interesting regions, both recently and in the distant past. We should also not forget that a number of missions after Viking, the first spacecraft to successfully land on Mars, were not sterilized at all, because it was thought that Mars was not inhabited. And sterilization procedures, if any, on Mars probes launched by the Soviet space programme, some of which landed or crashed on the martian surface, are undisclosed.

We envision two different scenarios that are relevant to redefining planetary protection priorities. Starting from the premise that Earth life must have been transferred naturally to Mars before, it may have survived on Mars during earlier, wetter times. But terrestrial microorganisms that were transferred billions of years ago to a more hospitable martian surface would have had to either evolve to adapt to the changing environment, or perish. If Earth life (either ancient or more recent) is not able to survive on present-day Mars, any strains of ancient life would be long gone and any newcomers delivered by meteorites would be killed on arrival or soon after  and the same would hold for artificial transfer by spacecraft. We conclude that, if Earth life cannot thrive on Mars today, our concerns about forward contamination of Mars with Earth organisms are unwarranted. Our money and efforts can be better directed at alternative endeavours.

If, on the other hand, Earth microorganisms can in fact live on present-day Mars, we can safely presume that they could have survived even more easily in the past on a wetter early Mars. With a period of about 4 billion years for possible transport to a potentially habitable martian surface, combined with a higher rate of asteroidal impacts in ancient times, a large range of Earth microorganisms could have been transported to Mars and widely distributed. In this case, we can safely conclude that Earth life is already present on Mars. Therefore, it is too late to protect Mars from terrestrial life, and we can safely relax the planetary protection policies.

In the second scenario, if life on Mars originated independently and has not yet died out, life indigenous to Mars and life imported from Earth by interplanetary transport are already coexisting and have coexisted for eons. Possible microorganisms onboard our spacecraft would not interact with the indigenous Mars life in a different way than previous Earth life transported to Mars. Any competition between Mars life and Earth life would have played out long before the arrival of human spacecraft. Future missions would simply find the survivors of this natural selection process, and these survivors would be expected to be better adapted to martian conditions than new arrivals from Earth. Regardless of the degree of similarity between any life on Mars and Earth, microorganisms delivered from Earth by spacecraft would not be detrimental for any currently existing organisms on Mars, which would have already encountered Earth life. </TEXT>

**The overprotection of Mars**
___

**Planetary protection policies aim to guard Solar System bodies from biological contamination from spacecraft. Costly efforts to sterilize Mars spacecraft need to be re-evaluated, as they are unnecessarily inhibiting a more ambitious agenda to search for extant life on Mars.**

The mission of NASA's Office of Planetary Protection is to protect Solar System bodies  including planets, moons, comets and asteroids  from contamination by Earth life, and to protect Earth from possible life forms that may be returned from other Solar System bodies. To accomplish these objectives, the programme absorbs a meagre amount of the NASA budget when viewed in its entirety. But the budget for a specific mission to Mars can substantially increase if its landing site is designated by the Office of Planetary Protection as a region of potential astrobiological interest  the so-called 'special regions'  in which, theoretically, Mars life could exist and/or Earth life could survive. Indeed, other space agencies have also developed similar costly strategies to avoid the contamination of Mars with terrestrial microorganisms onboard spacecraft.

From an astrobiological view-point, the most interesting missions are obviously those devoted to the search for possible life beyond Earth. Thus, astrobiological missions to Mars should be targeting precisely these special regions. However, such missions must undergo the scrutiny of NASA planetary protection protocols and are required to comply with detailed and expensive sterilization requirements ([Fig. 1](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n7/fig_tab/ngeo1866_F1.html)) to prevent the interplanetary transport of microorganisms that, in practice, make them unviable. Consequently, we have not had any mission devoted to the in situ search for extant life on Mars in decades. Here we argue that the protocols and policies of planetary protection are unnecessarily restricting Mars exploration and need to be revised.

Tasting note as per the label on [the chocolate](http://www.omnomchocolate.com/products/papua-new-guinea-70): "*The sophisticated union of nutty leather and smoky tobacco plays with a whisper of burned oak tamed by a buttery bourbon finish*."

The nose is just as satisfying, dominated by tobacco and oak, with softer hints of cherries.

<TEXT> A self sustaining geodynamo is not required for a planetary body to remain geologically active due to cooling rates, and density contrasts (see Venus, Io). There is evidence in support of active Martian geology (see my other comment [here](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3mdvtn/nasa_will_announce_a_major_mars_discovery_on/cvefmso)) For example, it is suggested that our moon may have a bout of volcanism in the future, for example:

"Today, the Moon is still cooling down, as are the melts in its interior. So in the distant future, the cooler and therefore solidifying melt will change in composition, likely making it less dense than its surroundings. 
This lighter magma could make its way again up to the surface forming an active volcano on the Moon." -[source](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2103696/Volcanoes-Moon-Research-shows-lunar-surface-day-lava-flows.html)

Furthermore, our moon may still be geologically active: [Shrinking   growing Moon](http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov//vis/a010000/a010900/a010948/10915_MOON_GRABEN-540-MASTER_high.webmhd.webm). </TEXT>

And multiple others. Without further research there simply isn't enough data to conclude that Mars is currently either geologically dead or active.

<TEXT> I'm not certain about the conditions, or how well constrained our knowledge is with regards to certain specifics surrounding Saturn and Enceladus, but I'm willing to speculate that it wouldn't be a very favourable location for potential space colonies. 

Resources: Unlike the terrestrial planets, asteroids, or even our own moon there's no available mineral resources to be found in abundance. Perhaps the issue could be skirted somehow, but why not just look for a more hospitable location to begin with?

Stability: Many surface features, and cryoactivty on Saturn's moon Enceladus bear resemblance to those observed on Jupiter's moon Europa, and its icy shell. Recently, it is suggested that Europa may be host to a similar type (though not identical) of [plate tectonics](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n10/full/ngeo2245.html) as Earth. Enceladus is riddled with features denoting [a good degree of activity](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n2/full/ngeo763.html) - thus it might not be a satisfactory location if you're looking for a location with a good degree of stability.

Ever the menace: Saturn like Jupiter emits radiation, though how much, and more specifically, how much reacts with Enceladus and to what degree I remain uncertain. However, this certainly seems like an area of potential concern for any long term colonization.

I'm sure there are a plethora of other concerns, but those are just a few that immediately spring to mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course it has something to do with pre-exisitng faults. Hydraulic fracturing, as well as fluid injection of waste water into disposal wells has been demonstrated on multiple accounts to generate EQs through reactivation of ancient faults (pre-existing planes of weakness within the rock). Motion along a fault isn't triggered by the fault itself, it's a release of accumulated stress (sigma one) - in this instance it was determined that stress was induced by hydraulic fracturing which increased lithostatic strain beyond the failure envelope. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of particular interest was with regards to Earth processes as analogs on Mars. As there is thought to be no plate tectonics present on Mars, the question remains then as to how the layers of sedimentary rocks seen on Mars formed to begin with. Typically, on Earth sediments are deposited into a basin where they accumulate with the addition of sediments overlying the initial deposits. Increases in pressure and temperature begin to cook the sediments, compacting them into rocks. They would remain buried at depth if it were not for some process in which to exhume them - on Earth, plate tectonics provides just such a mechanism; however, this doesn't appear to be the process at work on Mars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The evidence, for me, is what I have to go by - and while it appears as though there are a number of questions that yet remain to be answered I find that the theory that *currently* best answers the most questions, at least satisfactorily remains in the domain of climate change. As far as I can tell the best evidence (in North America) for the overkill hypothesis is by means of statistical analysis - which has issues of it's own. Comparatively, the evidence for climate change is based on numerous lines of hard evidence (not just stats, and assumptions), from DNA analysis, fossil analysis, paleo ecological reconstructions, etc. 

The overkill hypothesis is not without it's problems. For example, there are numerous sites which show evidence (though some are debated) of pre-Clovis era colonization in North America (further noting the Monte Verde site in Chile, South America). If this is the case, it becomes difficult to fathom that humans co-existed with megafauna, and then suddenly wiped them out. Furthermore, in regards to Clovis era sites, there are only a few that are accepted as kill sites that date to the appropriate time period. There are approx. 28 sites, out of 180 known sites that have been date to the corresponding time period. Of those 28 sites, a mere 14 are widely accepted as kill sites showing Mammoth / Mastadon and spear points. Now recall that 35 genera became extinct (ie. thousands upon thousands of species) - 14 sites is a tiny number, and that's a major problem for the overkill hypothesis (note:[Timing of extinction of the North American Pleistocene megafauna](http://imgur.com/a/znion) from [*Late Pleistocene Megafaunal Extinctions*, Elias and Schreve, '07](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/files/1398773/Article_318_Late_Pleistocene_megafaunal_extinctions.pdf))
The other major problem with the overkill hypothesis is that the evidence, aside from statistical analysis of arrival times, is extremely scant while noting that the statistical analysis is also potentially heavily laden with incorrect assumptions, unaccounted for variables, and an inherent mathematical attribute similar to non-uniqueness found in models.

In my opinion, a good portion of the counter arguments to climatic and ecological dominant forcings with regard to the Late Pleistocene extinctions in North America seem over simplified upon examination. Climate change is not uniform, and therefore it should not be expected to be similar from pole-to-pole (noting the Polar see-saw for example). The local ecology will vary from region to region, and thus ecological responses will differ alongside differences in population density, and distribution over time. Perhaps, a threshold was reached due to previous oscillations (stadial - interstadial conditions), while also noting that no two climate oscillations were/are the same (The Younger Dryas, for example, is the youngest, longest, and coldest of three stadials that resulted from typically abrupt climatic changes that took place over the last 16,000 calendar years), and thus may provide an answer as to why one specific event may have been more detrimental than others. </TEXT>

Their arguments remain the same, rehashed and flawed. No one has been able to replicate their findings. As I mentioned earlier, there is plenty of good evidence with regards to the Younger Dryas stadial and the draining of Lake Agassiz, for which glacial dynamics are the only prerequisite for a cause, and of which have been satisfactorily investigated. On the other hand, there has yet to be a single shred of evidence that points conclusively to an impact event. I suggest you refrain from your preschool antics of shouting and screaming, and actually research the topic further. A good start is with the numerous links and papers I have provided previously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basic Scientific Fact: Bitumen is not heavy crude, and nor is it extra heavy crude, it's bitumen - the deposits are a mixture of quartz/clay particles, water, and bitumen.

Definitions of heavy oil and bitumen are shown graphically in [figure 11](http://i.imgur.com/IjBeOek.png). The value of 10API, which is equivalent to that of water, provides a clear border between (unconventional) extraheavy oil and conventional heavy oil. However, it is more accurate to define heavy oil in terms of viscosity, rather than API gravity. Crude below 10API with viscosity of 1,00010,000 cP is considered as extraheavy oil, and that with viscosity above 10,000 cP is considered as bitumen.

EDIT: I should also like to note that what ever your stance on the term 'tar sands' it's still used in the scientific literature as can be seen in [Unconventional Petroleum Geology](http://store.elsevier.com/Unconventional-Petroleum-Geology/Caineng-Zou/isbn-9780123977861/) as I've highlighted [here](http://i.imgur.com/dEubc9J.png), and can be read in the description in the hyperlink.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not possible. Io has ~~no water~~ a negligible amount of water, [a prerequisite](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm) for the style of plate tectonics that occurs on Earth. The mountains of Io and what they mean for *patera* (volcanic lakes that are frequently within the near vicinity of Ionian mountains) are likely genetically related.
___
**Mountains on Io:**

A quick review of Ios mountain structures reveals mesas, plateaus, peaks, ridges, and massifs with some common morphological features between them such as rising abruptly out of the volcanic plains with virtually no headlands or foothills and often surrounded by basal scarps, tens to a few hundred meters high (Schenk et al 2001). Many of these mountains resemble flatiron mountains on Earth and are therefore interpreted as tilted crustal blocks. Plate tectonics however, is not the suspected mechanism. Rather it is hypothesized that most mountains are thrust blocks formed as a result of compressive stressed built up in the lower crust due to the global subsidence of volcanic layers as they are buried over time (Schenk and Bulmer 1998). In other words, the mountains are primarily driven upwards to compensate for  the compression caused as materials at the surface of Io are pushed down, which is augmented by expansion caused by heating of the rocks as they approach the base of the lithosphere (Keszthelyi et al 2004). This is supported by the presence of patarae within the immediate vicinity of Ionian mountains; however, it is not certain which occurred first. The observed similarities in mass-wasting events seen between Ios mountains may suggest a similar mode of formation, and are observed in differing states of degradation. As Jaeger et al. (2003) point out, a large number (38 out of 92) of tectonic massifs are in contact with paterae which is approximately 60% more than is expected from a random distribution, which they estimate has a probability of 0.14% chance of occurring. Therefore, concluding that there must be a genetic relationship between Ionian mountains and paterae such that faults associated with mountain formation serve as conduits for magma ascent, and thus facilitate the formation of paterae around mountains.

- [Figure 1a](http://i.imgur.com/JJRhkOr.png): (a) One current post-Galileo model of volcanic processes and the interior of Io. 

- [Figure 1b](http://i.imgur.com/gvfIPTk.png): (b) Cartoon of a leading patera formation model. Silicate magma (red) ascends through solid silicate rock (black) but lacks the buoyancy to rise through a volatile-rich zone (dark blue) near the surface. The heat from the intrusion melts surrounding sulfur (yellow) and SO2 (light blue), which migrate into the permeable surroundings. Where SO2 is vaporized, it erupts on the surface, sometimes entraining sulfur. As this process continues, a caldera-like depression forms over the intrusion. If the silicate magma flux is sustained, it may become locally or completely unroofed, forming a dark lava lake. Diagrams after Keszthelyi et al (2004).

- [Figure 2](http://imgur.com/Jx5YVzt): The image on the left shows Monan Patera (top) and another patera (bottom) at either end of a crescent shaped mountain (15.4_N, 104.0_W). Monan Patera is a green-floored depression with red diffuse deposits along its margin. The patera to the south has a variegated floor with red, green, orange, and yellow patches. In the schematic diagram on the right, the solid black line is the bow that defines the curvature of the mountain, the dashed line connecting its ends is the bowstring, and the red arrow strung on the bow indicates the movement direction of the hanging wall during thrust faulting. The dashed lines and red arrows in the paterae indicate the senses of offset on and approximate positions of the shear zones that bound the thrust sheet (Jaeger, 2003).

Having read the paper, she provides fairly convincing arguments for a number of observed textures / features, and **(1)** I'm curious to understand why her interpretation seemingly received little attention? Granted other interpretations into their formation may also be valid, it seems this would produce a set of competing hypothesis, and as such should have been evaluated further. **(2)** What analysis, if any, was done in order to dismiss Noffke's interpretation(s) - and if no such analysis was conducted that can conclusively dismiss her interpretation(s)  **(3)** does this area remain a region for future exploration and data acquisition, and what kind of priority would it be given if so? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope, they're more alkaline / basic. This is the Nahanni Dehe Tufa Mound in the North West Territories. There are a lot of close geological terms to tufa, such as tephra (unconsolidated ash, bombs, and other fragments) , tuff (lithified ash deposits), and travertine. While tephra and tuff are deposits of volcanic origin, travertine and tufa are sedimentary deposits of CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) precipitated out of solution and subsequently mineralized to form these deposits. Travertine is sourced from hot, hydrothermal sources (hot springs) while tufa is sourced from more ambient temperature, spring waters. 

As the spring water rises from depth the alkaline waters, supersaturated in CaCO3, undergo a reduction in pressure. This reduction in pressure promotes the degassing of volatiles such as CO2 which increases the pH of the system. Carbonate, CO3, solubility [decreases as you increase the pH](http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/solut/solut-images/geocarbsystem_aq.png) of the system and thus precipitates out of solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One is not bad while the other is good, they both have their benefits. Your chest acts to pull your arms, while your triceps act to extend your forearm (chest = pull, triceps = push). If you want to place more focus on the triceps, perhaps you have a sticking or weak point in the movement, then keeping your elbows closer to your body will place more emphasis on the triceps simply due to the mechanics. The close or narrow grip bench press is considered the go-to exercise for improving tricep strength, much like the squat for legs. Having your elbows out places more emphasis on your chest (pectorals) as you are no longer acting to extend your forearms as much (ie. pushing motion, increasing the angle between your bicep and forearms) but rather acting to pull your elbows inwards, towards the centre of the chest as your arms move forward. Just keep in mind that there are many different styles of push up / presses that each have their own benefit, and in some cases, their cons as well. For example, he states early on in the video to essentially roll your shoulders forward at the top of the push up - while this may be okay for some, for others it may not be due to shoulder impingement, and I certainly would stay away from transferring that motion from your pushup to your bench press as the chances for injury will be higher with more added weight. 

My recommendation is to try what feels best for you, because that's likely what works best with your bodies mechanics. Note that this doesn't necessarily mean it's easier. </TEXT>

[How The Earth Was Made S01E04 Loch Ness](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1l5ei5_how-the-earth-was-made-s01e04-loch-ness_tv)

TL;DW: The present day Loch Ness is about 10,000 years old and dates from the end of the last Ice Age (which lasted more than 20,000 years). During that age, the Great Glen was occupied by a huge glacier. This glacier easily eroded the Great Glen fault which accounts for the great depth of Loch Ness to 182m (600ft) below sea-level. </TEXT>

On Pluto, I would assume that there is some sort of shallow convection driving and generating these patterns. The dark regions may simply be regions of a less uniform surface, or perhaps, being older it has been irradiated by solar radiation for a longer duration (or perhaps both).

<TEXT> I responded to a similar question in another thread ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3bjs87/superearths_are_not_a_good_place_for_plate/csn3kid?context=10000)), so I'll just copy   paste my comment here for you in hopes that it will provide you with further insight:

It's somewhat two fold. Firstly, [you need water for plate tectonics](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm), and water also acts as a medium in which to transport elements. Plate tectonics themselves are not necessary for life to develop; for example, life on Earth began prior to [3.5 billion years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean_life_in_the_Barberton_Greenstone_Belt) while the onset of plate tectonics occurred roughly [3 billion years ago](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2466_F4.html). However, while plate tectonics is not *necessary* for life, it certainly assists in the evolution of life. A contributing factor to the rising and falling (transgression / regression) sea levels relates to mid ocean spreading ridges. During times of relatively faster sea floor spreading rates, sea levels rise (and fall during times of slower sea floor spreading rates), and the oceans become dominated by a clacite chemistry ([calcite - aragonite seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CalciteSeasTable.jpg)). You can start to see how rising and falling sea levels, along with changing ocean chemistry would act to generate adaptive pressures for lifeforms to evolve under on long timescales. While we're at it, let's not forget that it promotes diversification as the plates move, continents accrete forming supercontinents (Pangea, for example), and pulling landmasses apart generating more shallow seas which in turn creates more room for life (carbonate reefs, etc).
More importantly; however, plate tectonics allows you to replenish the supply of elements to a number of systems on much faster timescales, and on global scale - as opposed to slower rates, and localized events that would be typical of a body in which there was tectonism, but no plate tectonics (all bodies have tectonics, including our [moon](watch?v=zDmEnjwAYIY), but only Earth is known to have plate tectonics). Plate tectonics also acts as a global thermostat (think CO2 draw down and the carbon cycle - silicate weathering, etc.). 

**TL;DR**: Plate tectonics is not necessary for life, but helps promote it through diversification, providing adaptive pressure (changes in ocean chemistry, etc.), acting as a global thermostat, and rejuvenating the supply of elements required by life.

EDIT: Though debated, there are theories that support plate tectonics on Mars not only early on in its geological past^[1](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2474.html), ^[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1250232/), but currently as well^[3](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-scientist-discovers-plate-237303) .

Regarding the Kuiper Belt:

1) A region of space covering approx. 20AU

2) Relatively small remnant bodies (small mass)

3) Orbital periodicity / speed and inclination w.r.t. the ecliptic plane (10km/s which plays a large part with regards to timing)

With these three factors we can note that activity within the Kuiper Belt region must be relatively low.
___
Regarding the Inner Solar System:

1) A region of space covering approx. 3.2AU

2) Relatively small remnant bodies (asteroids, short term comets, dwarf planets) and the terrestrial planets

3) Orbital periodocity / speed and inclination w.r.t the ecliptic plane (20km/s, upwards of 50km/s)

4) [Perturbations from Jupiter](http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/villain-in-disguise-jupiters-role-in-impacts-on-earth/) (something the Kuiper Belt lacks)
___

While the Inner Solar System had a large degree of material accreted early on during the formation of the solar system, it still has a lot of activity, primarily because of (1), (3), and (4). The region is immensely tiny in comparison to the Kuiper Belt (3.2AU vs. 20AU), with much faster orbital speeds and small orbits. This means the probability of experiencing an impact event *must* be greater than those experienced in the Kuiper Belt. Lastly, and it's a big one, Jupiter sends innumerable bodies into the Inner Solar System by perturbing the Asteroid Belt. A simple reflection on how many asteroids impact the Earth and other terrestrial bodies should bode well to persuade anyone that activity within the Inner Solar System should be greater than that which occurs within the Kuiper Belt. Note that the low speeds, orbital inclinations, small size / low mass, and extremely large distances between objects are all unfavorable if you are trying to maintain a higher degree of activity in comparison to the Inner Solar System.

<TEXT> Other way around.

Your statement contradicts itself. As the inner solar system has larger bodies, with more gravitational pull, they will be impacted more frequently (ie. have more craters) compared to the [Kuiper Belt](http://www.lunarplanner.com/Images/asteroid-orbits/dwarf-Kuiper-Oort.png) which is composed of smaller bodies (therefore having less gravitational pull towards one another) over a much larger distance than the inner solar system, with much larger orbital periods. The distance from the Sun to the Asteroid Belt is ~3.2AU while the Kuiper Belt spans a total distance of ~20AU with a mass of less than a tenth to less than a hundredth that of Earth. In other words, /u/hungry-ghost is correct. You would expect more impacts towards the inner solar system relative to the Kuiper Belt, especially as [Jupiter constantly perturbs the asteroid belt](http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/villain-in-disguise-jupiters-role-in-impacts-on-earth/) sending material inward. 

Early on during the formation of the solar system, the inner solar system was chaotic - as the gas giants [migrated inwards, and then back out](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v475/n7355/fig_tab/nature10201_F2.html) (leading to the Late Heavy Bombardment), whereas the Kuiper Belt region should have been far less active. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really, ([it has detected CH4](http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/10/23/the-perfume-of-67pc-g/) amongst many, many other organics) because while CH4 is often a byproduct of biological metabolic processes, it's also a very simple organic compound which can be produced by various abiogenic processes.  

EDIT: I should also state that while detection of multiple organic compounds have been made, I'm currently unaware as to whether or not comet 67P's CH4 isotopic signature has been determined (or if there are any capable instruments on board Philae or Rosetta in order to conduct such an analysis). Taking such measurements *might* be able to help discern as to whether or not the CH4 (and other organics) are biogenic or abiogenic in origin.

<TEXT> I had originally shared the guardian article a day or so ago, but after recalling *who* was to be presenting their case [I immediately deleted the submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3c8p11/philae_comet_could_be_home_to_alien_life_say_top/cstj4mb?context=3). 

[Chandra Wickramasinghe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_Wickramasinghe) is notorious for pushing absolutely bogus claims in support of extraterrestrial life (see '[No, Life Has Still Not Been Found in a Meteorite](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/03/11/meteorite_life_claims_of_fossils_in_a_meteorite_are_still_wrong.html) and [No, Diatoms Have Not Been Found in a Meteorite](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/01/15/life_in_a_meteorite_claims_by_n_c_wickramasinghe_of_diatoms_in_a_meteorite.html)').

In short, a '[Wacky claim from academic with a record of wacky claims should be ignored](http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/07/magic-carbon-layer-not-a-sign-of-extraterrestrial-life/), and the Guardian has since updated their original article: [No alien life on Philae comet](http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/jul/06/no-alien-life-on-philae-comet?CMP=twt_science-gdnscience).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's certainly one of the reasons it's important for life, but not necessary for life as I discussed in my other comment. Lets say life uses 'x'. If life uses x until there is no more x left, where will it find more x? It can't, unless the source is replenished, which is achieved via plate tectonics. 

Plate tectonics helps to create massive mountain belts, pushing mountains upwards via thrusting and folding. Weathering breaks down the minerals and erosion carries them down streams towards basins, or the wind picks them up and transports them elsewhere (Loess). Typical elements include Mg, Fe, Al, Ca, Na, K, F, SiO2 with other sources coming from ore deposits (Cu, S, Zn, P, etc.). It should be noted that plate tectonics and ore deposits are very strongly linked, and even studied under the term '[metallogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallogeny).' Certain [deposit types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore#Classification) are only associated with certain processes, many of which could not occur without plate tectonics (or at least would be very, very unlikely) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's somewhat two fold. Firstly, [you need water for plate tectonics](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm), and water also acts as a medium in which to transport elements. Plate tectonics themselves are not necessary for life to develop; for example, life on Earth began prior to [3.5 billion years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean_life_in_the_Barberton_Greenstone_Belt) while the onset of plate tectonics occurred roughly [3 billion years ago](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2466_F4.html). However, while plate tectonics is not *necessary* for life, it certainly assists in the evolution of life. A contributing factor to the rising and falling (transgression / regression) sea levels relates to mid ocean spreading ridges. During times of relatively faster sea floor spreading rates, sea levels rise (and fall during times of slower sea floor spreading rates), and the oceans become dominated by a clacite chemistry ([calcite - aragonite seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CalciteSeasTable.jpg)). You can start to see how rising and falling sea levels, along with changing ocean chemistry would act to generate adaptive pressures for lifeforms to evolve under on long timescales. While we're at it, let's not forget that it promotes diversification as the plates move, continents accrete forming supercontinents (Pangea, for example), and pulling landmasses apart generating more shallow seas which in turn creates more room for life (carbonate reefs, etc).
More importantly; however, plate tectonics allows you to replenish the supply of elements to a number of systems on much faster timescales, and on global scale - as opposed to slower rates, and localized events that would be typical of a body in which there was tectonism, but no plate tectonics (all bodies have tectonics, including our [moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDmEnjwAYIY), but only Earth is known to have plate tectonics). Plate tectonics also acts as a global thermostat (think CO2 draw down and the carbon cycle - silicate weathering, etc.). 

**TL;DR**: Plate tectonics is not necessary for life, but helps promote it through diversification, providing adaptive pressure (changes in ocean chemistry, etc.), acting as a global thermostat, and rejuvenating the supply of elements required by life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure you understand the paper or what is meant by modern continental crust. Perhaps you do though, and I'm simply misinterpreting your point. Modern continental crust (not the position or shapes of modern continents) is vastly different in composition to older, more mafic (baslatic / komatiitic compositions) lavas. The significance is not in regards to the absolute age of any crust, however, but rather that a distinction between crustal types can be used to infer the onset of plate tectonics as is shown in [Fig.4](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2466_F4.html). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was hoping they would show focal mechanisms. Geophysicists plot the arrival of seismic waves, and can determine what type of motion occurred along a fault plane. If you ever visit the USGS earthquake page and click on '[moment tensor](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20002ejl#scientific_tensor)' under the scientific heading you will see a diagram (often termed as a beach ball diagram) that can be used to interpret and discern the type of motion along the fault plane. For example, as can be seen [in this diagram](http://all-geo.org/highlyallochthonous/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/focalmechs.png) each earthquake generates a unique solution. The shaded quadrants represent areas of compression while the white, or non shaded quadrants, represent areas of dilation or extension. Using the two hyperlinks provided you should be able to discern what type of motion occurred during the M7.3 EQ provided above.

One of the classic ways to distinguish seismic waves emanating from earthquake vs. seismic waves original from blasts, including underground nuclear tests, is that the energy from explosions is all directed radially outwards, while the initial pulse of energy from earthquakes is compressional in some quadrants, but dilatational in others. This means that for an explosive blast all quadrants would be shaded, or in other words, an explosion will appear to be fully compressed because an explosion pushes on every direction.

You can learn more about fault plane solutions [here](http://www.learninggeoscience.net/free/00071/)

<TEXT> This may seem somewhat counter-intuitive, but the larger the body the less pronounced the topographical features tend to be. That is to say, that the smaller the body is, the larger the relief can be. This is due to gravity, and it's why planets are spherical in shape while smaller bodies, such as asteroids, are less spherical. Gravity essentially limits the height of mountains by pulling everything towards the centre of the body.

On Mars, gravity is roughly 2.7 times weaker than on Earth. Thats the same factor by which Olympus Mons is higher than Everestabout 2.7 times. Less gravity equals less pressure on the base. So if you really want high mountains, go to the planet with the weakest gravity.

Notably nearby; however, lies a volcanic [Mount Meager volcanic massif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meager) and the infamous [Keyhole Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Falls), the formation of which coincides with the Lil'wat flood mythology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Climate change explains more than you're permitting. Certainly the spread of humans didn't help; however, there are large holes in the theory that humans were the primary driver behind megafaunal extinctions in North America. As Gary Haynes states in his lecture (which I recommend to you, titled, "Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions" and can be found on youtube), of the clovis sites that date to the same age ~13ka there exists 28 out of the known 180 that contain Mammoth, Mastadon and spear points. Everything else, it is extremely rare and difficult to find any evidence that humans had anything to do with killing the animal. As he further notes, the evidence in some of the 28 sites isn't that strong and the more widely accepted figure is 14 sites out of the 180 known Clovis sites. Keep in mind that 35 genera went extinct... a major problem for the human theory to explain. And while Mammoths and Mastadons were killed, it was far more likely that climate change was the primary causal agent - this is well established and supported by a change in their food supply (yes, thanks to climate change), as was released in the following Nature study, "Fifty thousand years of Arctic vegetation and megafaunal diet" but is nicely summarized [here](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/woolly-mammoth-diet-mystery-solved-by-dna-analysis-1.2524015). Note the following: 

"Most of the evidence we've been able to see is these large mammals disappear almost at the same time these vegetation changes were taking place," Froese said.

Also note that if there were persons in North America prior to Clovis then they were living next to those animals and *not* wiping them out.

I'm honestly somewhat shocked that you would state the following:
There have been many cycles of glaciation and none had extinctions nearly as severe as the most recent.

Knowing full well that not every glaciation was the same, nor were the conditions surrounding each one identical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm unaware of how animal behavior responds to geomagnetic reversals; however, I may be able provide at least some insight into the reversals themselves. Firstly though, keep in mind that Earth's magnetic field, its polarity, is not stationary and [moves all the time](http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/) (you can see this in motion if you search for "Magnetic Poles   Declination 1790 - 2020 Mercator Projection - Historical"). Currently, the pole is migrating northward about 64 kilometers (40 miles) per year (does this effect animal behavior?). Most importantly, however, is the wide acceptance that geomagnetic reversals don't occur instantaneously but typically on time scales upwards of several hundred years to thousands of years and are not 'clean' reversals. There have also been [numerous reversals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_0-169_Ma.svg) throughout Earth's geologic past. 

Given the rate at which reversals occur it seems unlikely that they would have any detrimental effects on animal behavior. I would find it interesting to pair species distributions in the fossil record with times of geomagnetic reversals to see if any perturbations could be discerned. I haven't read the paper yet, but it would also be interesting to see what effects magnetic storms, and other magnetic anomalies (magnetite rich soils, etc.) may have had on the worms.

EDIT: To further clarify the point regarding the rate of reversals and the effects on animal migration (those most likely to rely on Earth's magnetic fields) it seems highly improbable that there should be any observable difference for a number of reasons. Firstly, magnetic reversals occur on the time scales over many thousands of years, whereby the field reverses and begins to strengthen again. Secondly, animal life spans must be considered and compared to the rate of magnetic field reversals. Given that animal life spans are typically quite short in comparison, (the Arctic Tern is a long lived bird with an average lifespan of approx. 30 years) this implies that magnetic reversals would have no effect as the location is passed from generation to generation, given ample time to adapt to miniscule changes over their life time. Thirdly, while animals use magnetoception to assist them, this is by no means their only use for navigation as they will also incorporate other senses, such as visual cues and other magnetic anomalies (not to be confused with a weakening magnetic field).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The block belongs to numerous others positioned along the breakwater at Ogden Point in Victoria, BC. The vast majority of blocks are granodiorite in composition; however, a small number (~5?) are granite, with [abundant k-spar megacrysts](http://i.imgur.com/rLlkuml.jpg). Being that this granite clearly isn't in situ it makes it somewhat difficult to pin point its origin; however, I was able to locate some information that may provides at least some further insight:

___
Site Description: Victoria Breakwater (1916) Ogden Point off Dallas Road

___
*History*: The contract for the building of the Victoria breakwater called for 1.25 million cubic feet of dimension stone, consisting of large, roughly squared blocks of up to 20 tons in weight. This estimate actually fell short of the amount of stone needed, for by the end of May 1916, 1.5 million cubic feet had been delivered and the wall was not completed until the end of that year. 

*Building Stone*: The breakwaters constructed in both Victoria and Vancouver contain granite [granodiorite] from quarries on the southwest shore of [Hardy Island](http://i.imgur.com/Pmsfx3r.png). This stone contains a fair number of black knots which range up to 30 centimetres in diameter. This precluded its use as a decorative facing stone or as monumental stone but it has proven suitable for less ornamental uses as it is easily quarried in large blocks. The Victoria breakwater also incorporates basalt, quarried as rough rock and crushed stone, from Albert Head on lower Vancouver Island.

From [Dimension Stone in Victoria, BC](http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/Mining/Geoscience/EducationalResources/Documents/IC1994_15.pdf) (pdf)

Note: Some of the blocks have been replaced since the initial construction and may be from other quarries.

<TEXT> it has to do with exposure time, and it's why there are no stars in [lunar photographs as well](http://markhumphrys.com/Bitmaps/apollo.3.jpg). Because light is reflecting off of the surface of Ceres, you need a relatively short timed exposure - otherwise it would be over exposed and you wouldn't see anything but a lot of white. Such short exposure times; however, aren't long enough to capture the light from the distant stars, so they remain under exposed.

This example also shows you why, in order to capture those great shots of [the Milky Way](https://deepuniversetruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/wpid-milky-way-26711-1920x1080.jpg), you need, or prefer, no light pollution (ie. pitch black). Again, as before, this allows you to take longer timed exposures - collecting all that faint light from distant stars and having it picked up by the camera's sensor. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Deer Hunting with 00 Buck   choke sizing </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hello, 

I'll be hunting deer once the season starts and have chosen to use 00 Buck (I have a Mossberg 835 Ulti Mag so it doesn't take slugs)... regulations state a min. of no.1 or greater. 

I'd like to increase the effective distance of the shot and tighten up the pattern. I've seen numerous turkey chokes, Primos Jellyhead, Pure Gold, TruGlo Bone Collector Smackdown... but I'm conflicted. I've seen many people saying that turkey chokes, or anything beyond full choke is too tight for 00 but on the other hand I've also seen what look to be amazing results using 00 in the [Bone Collector Smackdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlP1km2XHfc).

Does anyone have any experience / suggestions for selecting an appropriate choke tube? 

Cheers

EDIT: While I appreciate the recommendations to use slugs, it is not permitted in the area in which I will be hunting. Because of this I would also appreciate if suggestions were made based on the information and question in which I had initially asked (deer - 00 buckshot - choke tubes) rather than ignoring it almost entirely (slugs). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Much of geology has its roots in religion. It was typical of clergy men to address how the world could fit alongside the teachings of the bible; however, modern Young Earth Creationism didn't truly come unto its own until the major discovery that lead to the formation of two distinct groups. Prior to this the church and geology walked hand-in-hand per say. For example, Neptunism (late 18th century), was a theory that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood - thus explaining the rocks while holding to the account of Noah's flood. However, with [James Hutton](http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/earth/p_hutton.html)'s discovery at Siccar Point, came the birth of two distinct camps - one, a group of men who held to what the rocks were telling them about the age of the Earth (modern geologists) and the other, a group of men who refused to accept that the Earth was older than what the church would have them believe - this was the birth of Young Earth Creationism as its own distinct camp. This event was so important, the distinction so clear, that it would eventually lead to one the greatest debates in the history of geology, a debate that would last ~40 years until finally it was accepted by the masses in 1970 (see [Channeled Scablands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channeled_Scablands)).

Hutton's 1788 paper concludes; "The result, therefore, of our present enquiry is, that we find no vestige of a beginning,no prospect of an end."

<TEXT> It should be noted that there are multiple mechanisms behind the formation of glacial ice caves. While a warming climate is certainly one of those mechanisms, others exist such as geothermal heating from volcanic vents and hotsprings. Under a stable climate regime, melting will typically occur on the surface under changing seasonal conditions whereby moulins can carry the water to englacial or subglacial regions - here the transfer of heat to the glacier from the meltwater can expand the cave, further airflow and instabilities can expand the cave(s). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the object, and the degree of diagenesis. Widely / generally speaking, diagenetic modification is more likely to play a role in organic matter compared to lithic material (depending, again on the original composition and the degree of diagenesis). If the *[blocking temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_temperature)* was achieved at some point then the dates will be off - though the data may still prove useful for other applications. In the case of organics the following is from 'Isotopes in Paleoenvironmental Research Vol.10' to serve as an example (Isotopes in Bones and Teeth):

Tooth behaves more or less similarly to bone, but enamel, as already mentioned, is a much more stable and less porous form of bioapatite, and is the material of choice for phosphate and carbonate studies (as well as for trace elements, including, for example, Sr isotopes). Nevertheless, even enamel cannot be entirely relied upon (Lee Thorpe and Sponheimer 2003). ... In the end any particular sample set has to be considered and tested on its own merits, and it is necessary to justify that diagenetic alteration has not corrupted the isotope ratios. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As others have mentioned, you can date the stratigraphic units in which the object is buried within (with fossils - relative dating, or with ash beds or other units - absolute dating). However, you can also date the object itself. Using typical radiometric dating techniques would not prove useful as you would be dating the age the minerals within the rock and not the age of the tool. You could, however, use optical dating techniques such as [thermoluminescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoluminescence_dating) (TL) and [optically stimulated luminescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optically_stimulated_luminescence) (OSL). These techniques basically date the last time in which the object was exposed to the sun, or to put it another way - the date when the object was buried. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  it could easily be the result of some kind of impact or stress.

This is most certainly a structural feature, so it has little to do with properties derived from the rock formation itself (and certainly nothing to do with mineral properties) but far more to do with the local stress regime. Though somewhat uncommon (symmetrical) it could be a stylolite infilled with hydrous calcium sulphate (gypsum). Here is one from [Banff](http://i.imgur.com/K20DjFF.jpg), and one in [Namibia](http://imgur.com/WPiohqA). Though some even question if those are actually stylolites.

<TEXT> Just some corrections 

Canada was covered by vast ~~subglacial~~ **proglacial** lakes.

For [example](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7289/images/nature08954-f1.2.jpg)

Those parts are ~~thousands~~ **hundreds of** meters thick *at most* with ~~clay~~ **glacial drift, and till**. 

An excerpt (Manitoba):

The bedrock surface throughout most of Manitoba is covered by overburden of varying thickness consisting mainly of glacial tills, proglacial lacustrine sediments and shallow marine deposits. The thickest overburden is found in the Manitoba Upland where bedrock is typically covered by 20 to 40 m of glacial till, outwash, and lacustrine deposits; however thicknesses in this area range from less than 10 m northeast of Turtle Mountain to more than 120 m in some bedrock channels and 250 m in the Duck Mountain area.

<TEXT> It's a theory, but a good theory based on some simple physics. I'll try to re-hash some old notes to help explain it:

######Earth's Magnetic Field:

Earth's magnetic field ([MF](http://portugalmundial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dynamos_magfield.jpg)) can be approximated (90%) by a dipole (bar magnet) with the MF oriented ~11 from the rotational poles. However, the MF is not due to permanent magnetism since the Earth's interior is far too hot (600C) to retain magnetization, therefore, it must be induced by electric current flow.

######Source of MF:

The MF is believed to be generated by thermally-driven convection currents in the fluid outer-core (electrically conductive molten iron) producing [a self-exciting dynamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory), with axial symmetry imposed by Earth's rotation. The study of which is called [Magnetohydrodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Geophysics) (combining electricity, magnetism, fluid dynamics, and heat flow). Mechanical models of self-exciting magnetic dynamos can be built as an analogy of Earth's MF.

######Faraday Disc:

(1) Consider a conducting disc rotating in an external MF. Negative charges accumulate at the rim, and positive charges accumulate at the axis due to the [Lorenz Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force). ([see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/7aRrhO6.png))

(2) The disc is connected to the axis with a conductive wire that allows current to flow (direction is that of positive charges by convention). The current flow in the loop induces a MF given by the right-hand-rule (RHR - point your thumb of your right hand along the current flow, when you curl your fingers it will be in the direction of induced MF). The current flow induced by the external MF induces a secondary MF in the same direction as the external MF, reinforcing the MF, inducing more current (positive feedback - [see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/K3oElCE.jpg)). A small transient MF can be amplified and lead to a self-sustaining MF, with the energy coming from rotation.

If you're interested further, or simply looking for further clarity and have some time to kill do a search for 'Nova - Magnetic Storm' </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 'jets' on Enceladus were recently shown to be explained away as an optical illusion, however, they are now thought to be eruptions that have a more continues shape [like a curtain](http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/cassini/saturn-moons-activity-could-be-curtain-eruptions), rather than discrete jets. 

 the ocean's high pH is caused by a "metamorphic, underwater geochemical process called serpentinization."

A bit picky here but the rocks are 'altered' during the process of serpentinization rather than metamorphosed, ie. alteration vs. metamorphism. 

A oceanic location that demonstrates the process above is the [Lost City Hydrothermal Field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_City_Hydrothermal_Field). </TEXT>

EDIT: For the classification of plutonic rocks geologists use the [QAPF diagram](http://www.sandatlas.org/wp-content/uploads/QAPF-diagram-for-plutonic-rocks.gif). Each corner or peak represents 100%, the Q = quartz, A =  Alkali feldspar (think potassium, giving a pinkish colour), P = Plagioclase (think calcium, with no Alkalis there should be no pinkish hue, only white), F = Feldspathoid (don't worry about this one). Essentially just use the top half QAP.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the lay person it may be confusing, but for persons who actually study and care to understand the underlying physical parameters it is night and day. The processes that govern the morphology of these structures will be different if their morphology is different. Therefore, noting that these phantom jets (as NASA states) are an optical illusion of the curtain eruptions is a critical distinction to make. What you propose is akin to calling all (or most) volcanic eruption styles the same thing, which certainly would lead to erroneous interpretations of what is actually driving the eruptions.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> The title is fine, and is why "Jets" is emphasized. While the curtain eruptions remain, the individual jets are likely an optical illusion. It's an important distinction that needs to be recognized as the underlying conditions will differ from between jets and curtains. In that sense, the jets are completely absent because they don't really exist, and are a result of an optical illusion from the curtain eruptions. Moreover, one should never come to a conclusion based on the title alone - always read the article, and if questions remain, read the actual study to help clear up any misconceptions or misunderstandings.   </TEXT>

Figures from the paper illustrate the authors premise: [Figure 1](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2418_F1.html) - [Figure 1](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2431_F1.html)(?) - [Figure 2](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2418_F2.html) - [Figure 3](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2418_F3.html).

In Nature Comments, Geodynamics: Double dip, Magali Billen notes that "*There are other known mechanisms that can lead to rapid changes in plate motion. For example, an upwelling plume head can accelerate mantle flow and an increase in slab density during initial subduction of a plate through the mantle transition zone can accelerate slab descent. However, these mechanisms lead to short-lived, one- to two-million-year pulses of accelerated plate motion. In contrast, the mechanism of double subduction can generate sustained, 20-million-year-long intervals of rapid plate motion, similar to that recorded for the Indian Plate during the late Cretaceous*". 

It's interesting work and will be interesting to see how it applies to modern double subduction zones, if at all, as well as its implications for paleo double subduction zones. </TEXT>

While not directly comparable to this plant, I did take notes on the vegetation around our sampling sites. Overall, there appeared to be a somewhat convincing correlation between pitcher plants and kimberlitic material for good reason. They thrive in damp, serpentine soils, thereby serving as useful indicators of serpentinite and/or peridotite in the vicinity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meaning, a 6 is 10 times more intense than a 5...

Intensity is measured using [The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercalli_intensity_scale) where as the  Richter Scale (used when applicable, on smaller earthquakes and the [moment magnitude scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale) (Mw) on larger earthquakes) is base 10 logarithmic scale and measures how much seismic energy is released. Each magnitude releases ~33 times more energy than the last. That is a M2.0 is 33 times more 'powerful' than a M1.0, a M3.0 is 1089 times more 'powerful' than a M1.0, a M4.0 is 35,937 times more 'powerful' than a M1.0, and so on up the scale.

The degree of damage depends on the moment magnitude, depth to hypocenter (focus), distance to epicenter, the local geology (which may dampen or amplify seismic waves), and the structural stability of buildings in the region.    </TEXT>

The one I shared appears to be a simplified version released by the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.news.wisc.edu/newsphotos/quartzvolcano.html) and may be showing trace amounts, or could be entirely incorrect as well.  For example, this image released by the USGS states the following: *Map of the known ash-fall boundaries for major eruptions from Long Valley Caldera, [Mount St. Helens](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vsc/images/image_mngr/300-399/img316.jpg) and Yellowstone* but we know Mt. St. Helens ash deposits were far more wide spread than depicted, easily reaching into [Canada](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/1980_Mount_st_helens_ash_distribution.svg). The problem is that they did not include bed thicknesses. Note that many figures often tend to have discrepancies and it's best to resort to actual papers. Under that premise, I suggest you read the paper I shared. It quite clearly demonstrates how incorrect your statement is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> QUESTION: Can you release some of the pressure at Yellowstone by drilling into the volcano? 

ANSWER: No. Scientists agree that drilling into a volcano would be of questionable usefulness. Notwithstanding the enormous expense and technological difficulties in drilling through hot, mushy rock, drilling is unlikely to have much effect. At near magmatic temperatures and pressures, any hole would rapidly become sealed by minerals crystallizing from the natural fluids that are present at those depths.

<TEXT> It's a complex question but broadly speaking no (that is the difference between great EQs and moderate EQs can easily be said to be no). The differences between the overall [moment magnitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale) is so large that smaller EQs essentially have a negligible effect on the strain that much larger EQs undergo. Typically stated, the difference between magnitudes is by a factor of ~33x. So Mw2.0 is ~33x more powerful than Mw1.0, and a Mw3.0 is 1089 times as powerful as a Mw1.0 and so on, up the scale. For clarity, the greater the difference between Mw the less likely it is that smaller EQs will have any effect in reducing the chances of a larger EQ occurring.

<TEXT> Geochemical differences aren't as problematic to the Giant Impactor models as one may be lead to believe. Certainly, there are a number of geochemical similarities, and expected differences (the depletion of [zinc relative to earth](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7420/full/nature11507.html) for example); however, the proportion of LILEs and in this case Ti, [a HFSE](http://i.imgur.com/ECoQGPQ.png) need not lead to the demise of the hypothesis but rather a reinterpretation favouring a specific percentage of material derived from Theia within an acceptable range. This isn't to say that the Giant Impact hypothesis isn't without some areas of difficulty; however, it is by far the most widely accepted theory because it can explain the *majority* of differences and similarities, as well as the angle of inclination, angular momentum, etc. In other words, though each model has areas which are problematic, the Giant Impact hypothesis has the fewest number of problems which require resolving.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> ######Lunar Fission Models:

Fission models involve the separation of the Moon from the Earth during an early stage of rapid spinning when tidal forces overcame gravitational forces. One version of the fission hypothesis (Wise, 1963) suggests that the formation of the Earths core reduced the amount of inertia, increasing the rotational rate and spinning off material to form the Moon. Such a model is attractive in that it accounts for the similarity in density between the Earths mantle and the Moon and for the absence of a large metallic lunar core. The hypothesis is also consistent with the Moons revolution in the same direction as the Earth rotates, the circular shape of the lunar orbit, the existence of a lunar bulge facing the Earth, and the similar oxygen isotopic ratios of the two bodies. The model also explains the iron-poor character of the Moon if fission occurred after core formation in the Earth, because the Moon would be formed largely from the Earths mantle. 

Fission models, however, face several major obstacles. For instance, they do not explain the inclination of the lunar orbit, and they require more than four times the total angular momentum available in the present EarthMoon system. If the EarthMoon system ever had this excess angular momentum, no acceptable mechanism has been pro-posed to lose it (Wood, 1986). Also, lunar igneous rocks are more depleted in siderophile
and volatile elements than terrestrial igneous rocks, indicating that the lunar interior is not similar in composition to the Earths mantle. Although some investigators favor a fission model (Binden, 1986), the preceding problems seem to render the model highly implausible.

The Giant Impactor models, on the other hand, are capable of accommodating more of the constraints related to lunar origin than any of the
competing models. What exactly is it about the Lunar soils that you *believe* are capable "killing" the Giant Impact Theory, keeping the aforementioned with regard to Lunar Fission models in mind? </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Glaciomarine clays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_clay) are a real concern, and remain beneath overburden due to the characteristics of their formation. This means you typically won't see them in surface exposures and would have to do core sampling to know where they are... a major concern for any proposed oil pipeline such as Enbridge's Northern Gateway Pipeline (and something to which I am unaware as to the extent to which Enbridge has drilled along their proposed corridor - though they have done aerial surveys - which I pointed out already, are essentially useless for detecting glaciomarine clays).

These landslides serve to illustrate the terrain instability along the pipeline corridor

from 
mountaintop to valley bottom. Landslides have damaged pipelines in west central B.C. Long 
runout landslides have traveled many kilometres from the initiation zone; therefore, the 
potential for damage to pipelines extends to unstable terrain and landslides that start well 
outside the construction corridor. Flow slides in glaciomarine muds have consumed pipelines 
located in depletion zones; therefore, pipeline locations must avoid potential depletion zones. 
Periods of increasing precipitation and temperature are associated with recent large landslides 
in west central B.C. Climate change scenarios project a warmer and wetter climate; therefore, 
the likelihood of landslide-mass erosion events affecting a pipeline or other linear structures 
will increase with a probable increase in landslide occurrence.  - ([PDF](https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents/55592/55592E.pdf))   </TEXT>

<TEXT> To clear some misinformation up:
since the reaction would be so far underground - and the ore no where near weapons grade - it would be self limiting and go largely unnoticed by observers on the surface.

Natural reactors need not be deep within the Earth's crust, and could have existed at the surface as was demonstrated by Coogan   Cullen:

The rise of free oxygen in Earths atmosphere resulted from the proliferation of the photosynthetic cyanobacteria. 
Fossil and molecular biomarker data from the geologic record date the origin of the cyanobacteria to 2.7 Gyr if not earlier. Evidence suggests the transition from an initial, virtually anoxic atmosphere to one with persistent free oxygen occurred as late as 2.4 Gyr ago leaving a significant lag between the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis and the irreversible oxidation of the Earths surface. Explanations for this delay commonly suggest secular changes in the balance between the fluxes of oxygen and reducing equivalents to the atmosphere coincident with the ~2.4 Gyr transition. Models include timely increases in the burial of organic matter, a decline in the content of reducing equivalents in volcanic and metamorphic source gases and progressive methane mediated hydrogen escape. Here we present calculations supporting the idea that due to its redox sensitivity, uranium deposits should have 
formed in the isolated marine or freshwater environments where oxygenic photosynthetic organisms first took hold and established strong local reduction-oxidation gradients. **[These are predicted to have formed near-surface critical natural fission reactors](http://i.imgur.com/KNveHej.jpg)**... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not entirely. The Giant Impact hypothesis suggests that while the Earth was forming, another body was forming (known as Theia) in a [Lagrangian point](http://i.imgur.com/e9h5bsl.png). It grew to roughly the size of Mars before being perturbed and eventually colliding with the Earth. The moon was subsequently formed from the debris of the impact, which has been estimated to be upwards of 70% of the mantle of Theia, while the Earth took on the iron rich core of Theia, leaving the moon depleted, relative to Earth, in iron (and explains other geochemical features).

It's important to make the distinction because there are other lunar formation models that would claim that the moon was in fact, initially part of the Earth... as in, 100% derived [from the Earth](http://i.imgur.com/9pL2up3.jpg). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stagnant / stagnated ice is a term that denotes that the ice isn't moving. In glaciology, for example, there are many types of landforms and geomorphological features that are generated by the stagnantion of ice, or more specifically, glacial ice. If, for example, the temperature were to rise quickly enough and by a large enough degree the glacial ice would stop accumulating and flowing, in other words it would stagnate. When this occurs, everything melts out of the ice as it just sits there, stagnated, and melts. Typical terrains (landscapes) associated with such a process are known as kame-and-kettle terrain / topography.   

Edit: For clarity, 'stagnate ice' is *not* a term (as far as I am aware of), and the useage by /u/SMlTH I believe is ... incorrectly applied as I don't believe the ice in the crater is melting *in situ*.

<TEXT> Actually, it wouldn't even come close. The end Permian event has been attributed to the out pouring of flood basalts known as [the Siberian Traps](http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/student/kaczor1/rk_files/image006.jpg) reaching a combined total thickness of ~6.5km. This volcanism persisted for roughly 1 million years (and would have looked similar to Iceland's [Holuhraun eruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_kfZhZxpxA). Io's eruptions, this one in particular, only persisted for less than 1 year and the reason it appears so large is due to the quick quenching of volcanic material into tiny particulate that can be dispersed over large regions thanks to Io's low mass, and therefore relatively low gravity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> humans can detect with orders of magnitude more precision...

Though I remain skeptical of their interpretation, in order to have a data set you have to have instruments that are not only sensitive enough to detect w/e it is you're looking for, but you also need to have instruments looking. In this particular case the mechanism appears to be similar to that which has been studied for earthquake lights. Under deformation, rocks will essentially act as batteries (see: [Pre-earthquake signals  Part I: Deviatoric stresses turn rocks into a
source of electric currents](http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/7/535/2007/nhess-7-535-2007.pdf) (pdf)). These charges accumulate on the surface and when dissipated they react with the atmosphere (in the case of earthquake lights). 

The most important conclusion to be draw from this series of experiments is that, when rocks such as granite or gabbro are subjected to deviatoric stress, they behave as if they were batteries. When stresses are applied, electronic charge carri-rs are activated, both electrons and pholes. In other words, the application of stress charges the battery.

I'm not saying that these are what the animals are sensing, but I am saying it may be analogous, and if so, there is no way yet to detect this in the field prior to the event.    </TEXT>

No, that's not *really* the case. 

Jupiter and the other Outer Planets might attract some of the asteroids and comets that would otherwise threaten the Inner Planets, which provides a bit of stability for Earth to allow life to develop.

Again, its akin to an old wives tale that refuses to die. Ever hear of the [Late Heavy Bombardment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIKmSQqp8wY)? The best suggestion to it's cause was due to [the migration of the giant planets](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/abs/nature03676.html) during the early solar system. Furthermore, Jupiter sends more material towards Earth than it shields us from:

Terminology for such a point is known as the *antipode* or the antipodal location. There has been no supportive evidence for the hypothesis. Also note that the Deccan Traps occurred in 3 phases, beginning [well before](http://massextinction.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/deccan_0205_science.png) the impact event.

Obviously without knowing the age of these impacts it's hard to say, but I'm curious.

The age of the impact is suspected to to be older than ~300Ma (million years ago):
Its a mystery  we cant find an extinction event that matches these collisions. I have a suspicion the impact could be older than 300m years. - [source](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/24/evidence-of-largest-asteroid-impact-zone-on-earth-found-in-australian-outback) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to leave your analysis of the analogy alone (even though I don't consider it a correct assessment), because I sense a deeper misunderstanding, at least that's what I've interpreted. 

...why I don't understand your reluctance. 

My reluctance comes from the following. It would be inccorect for me to fully accept your claim, because your claim was based on false pretenses. My point was not that plate tectonics is not a form of tectonism, but rather that the processes that drive plate tectonics are not the processes that drive tectonism. What I said, is that they are entirely different processes, a factually true statement. You said that was incorrect (which is false). You then stated that "plate tectonics is a type of tectonics." The problem is that I never disputed that point. I'll try another analogy:

Electricity is a type of energy. Coal fired plants are entirely different than nuclear plants. While both plants produce electricity (energy) they are entirely different processes. 

...but I don't think from my reading that this is true either. Aren't tectonics concerned with geological activity?

This is the area in which I wish to focus, because it implies that you either don't have a good grasp of geological terminology (which may be leading to the confusion above, and I don't blame you) or that you simply aren't aware of how geologically active our solar system is. I'll leave you to show yourself most of the research, but I'll give you a few examples. For one, our [Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68LOZvQTjB0) is likely still geologically active, and is tectonically active. Jupiters' moon, [Io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAejrPirGxI), is the most volcanic body in the solar system, has no plate tectonics (because there's no water) and has mountains generated from tectonic activity. The many moons of Saturn, are too a large degree, geologically and tectonically active. Typically stated, tectonics need not rely on a geologically active interior though there is a fine line in this statement and is why I opted to say 'typically stated.' I apologize if this isn't entirely clear, it's early in the morning now and I'm quite tired. If you have more questions, perhaps I can clear them, and my own statements, up later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suspect both are concretions, though I am certain the lower one is certainly a concretion. Port Hardy region?

*Nodules (also called concretions) are localized
patches that show differential cementation
from that of the host sediment. They may
form at any time after deposition during
burial, but are mainly early diagenetic in
origin. The formation of pre- and postcompaction
nodules is illustrated in [Fig.3.25.](http://i.imgur.com/he38cAC.jpg)
They may be randomly dispersed, concentrated
along particular horizons (especially
bedding planes), or nucleated around local
inhomogeneities (e.g. fossils, roots, burrows,
and so on). Their size varies from a few mm to
several metres in diameter, and shape from
spherical to elongate to highly irregular.*

*Many fossils are
replaced by minerals other than the original
during diagenesis  calcite, dolomite, silica,
pyrite, and hematite are common occurrences.
Many more dissolve and disappear
completely, in some cases giving rise to concretion
formation and pervasive cementation.*

*The main types include:*

* Calcite nodules: one of the most
common types, especially in mudstones,
sandstones, and soils; all sizes up to
several metres (known as doggers); in
soils they are also known as calcrete or
cornstone nodules, and as rhizocretions
where they develop around roots.*

* Dolomite nodules: less common but
similar occurrence to calcite nodules.*

* Siderite nodules: typical of organic-rich,
non-marine or brackish-water mudstones.*

* Pyrite nodules: typical of organic-rich,
marine mudstones.*

* Phosphate (collophane) nodules: also
typical of organic-rich, marine mudstones.*

* Gypsumanhydrite nodules: typical of
mudstones and soils in evaporite successions.
Can be replaced by quartz/
celestite.*

* Quartz (chert/flint) nodules: one of the
most common types, especially in carbonate
rocks. Many of the flint nodules
in chalks are nucleated in burrow networks
of Thalassinoides.*

 * Septarian nodules: these have radial and
concentic cracks, formed by nodule contraction
and peripheral growth, and filled
with calcite or siderite crystals.*

* Geodes: these have hollow centres with
crystals of (mainly) quartz, calcite or
dolomite growing towards the centre.*

* Cone-in-cone nodules: these have fibrous
calcite crystals arranged in a zig-zag conelike
pattern at right-angles to bedding,
typical of some organic-rich mudrocks.*

<TEXT> Plate tectonics *is* an entirely different *process* from other tectonics. For one, water is required for plate tectonics, but not for other forms of tectonism, you need key mineral assemblages to undergo phase changes in order to drive plate tectonics (see slab pull), etc. - You don't need any of these for 'tectonics.' Currently, Earth is the only known body in our solar system to have plate tectonics, while Europa may have [a different type](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4285) of plate tectonics, nearly every other body in our solar system has tectonics. To highlight this further, think of extensional tectonics, think of their mechanisms... now compare and contrast that to compressional tectonics... sure they are both a class of tectonism but they are entirely different, requiring entirely different mechanism, and underlying processes. It's important to make distinctions.     

I'll reluctantly grant you that plate tectonics, based on technicalities, is a type of tectonism but note that they are far from being similar processes. You are equating a class or type with a process or mechanism, which is incorrect. Analogously, it's like the difference between microbial mats and complex, highly intelligent life. Sure they're both organisms, but that really undermines the key differences between them that make them unique.

"...absolutely no question water was involved. In this case, groundwater   burial... Mineral-rich water circulating through sedimentary rocks under high pressure; crystals formed in cracks in rocks."

I find it difficult to believe that the dark greenish / greyish host rock is sedimentary. This is essentially a stockwork of veins in what I would initially have assumed to be a brecciated basalt. However, we need to keep in mind that with this much fluid passing through the rocks we should expect to see some degree of alteration. This is why colour is never really a good idea to use as an identifier. Furthermore, the [location](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/whereistherovernow/) - Pahrump Hills, given the context, almost certainly dictates that these are, as Emily stated, sedimentary rocks.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, the giant impact hypothesis is still the currently most widely accepted lunar formation theory. The Moon was once thought to be solid throughout, supposedly being too small to retain the heat from its formation. This changed with the Apollo landings, as seismicity was detected (moon quakes). The seismicity was used to discern the internal structure of the moon, much like how it is done on Earth. This lead to the understanding that the moon has a solid inner core, surrounded by a fluid outer core, followed by a region or zone partial melt, then a rocky mantle and crust. So while the moon retained a relatively warm central interior it was still thought to be...dead, per say.  Later, it was discovered that volcanic activity was actually quite recent, geologically speaking, within the past ~10 million years and certainly less than 50 million years ago. Again, none of these discoveries refutes the formation model; however, they do provide further insight into the thermodynamics of the moon. There also seems to be some confusion ITT with regards to tectonic activity and plate tectonic, two uniquely distinct mechanisms. The moon, while it lacks plate tectonics, is still tectonically active:

- [Graben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68LOZvQTjB0)

<TEXT> Steno, I appreciate your earlier work and contributions to geology but your information presented here is off base. There is a distinct difference between tectonic activity (tectonism) and plate tectonics. The moon is most certainly still tectonically active:

- [Lobate Scarps](http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=10631)

- [Graben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68LOZvQTjB0)

The only reason we understand that the internal structure of the moon (solid inner core, fluid outer core, zone of partial melt, rocky mantle, and crust) is through seismic activity. Geologically speaking, the moon has seen episodes of [relatively young volcanism](http://news.sciencemag.org/space/2014/10/recent-volcanic-eruptions-moon). Furthermore, it is speculated that there could be lunar volcanism in the distant(?) future. 

 the mantle is also too cool to support the movement of hot material up from the core.

That's not how density difference operate. See [magmatic assimilation](http://bio-geo-terms.blogspot.ca/2007/12/assimilation.html)

Note that this doesn't refute the point that there is currently no lava in the tubes, or that the moon does not have plate tectonics, it merely clears up some misleading statements regarding tectonism on the moon. </TEXT>

In essence, besides the scientific and technological advances that would be driven by lunar missions, there are a bounty of resources to take advantage of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's really nothing wrong with two locations in which 'ice' would be jetting out from cryovolcanism. For simplistic argument we can classify glaciers into temperate or warm based glaciers and polar or cold based glaciers. Warm base glaciers are aptly named as the base of the glacier, where it contacts the surface / bedrock is below the melting point. Because of this, you achieve a mechanism that permits the glacier to move called basal slip. Cold based glaciers are above the melting point, and so they are frozen to the surface which doesn't permit basal sliding ([Figure I](http://www.acegeography.com/uploads/1/8/6/4/18647856/9088392_orig.png?451)). Cold based glaciers move far, far slower because of this and their movement is generally caused by internal deformation ([Figure II](http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Cold%20environs/Ice%20movement/Glacier%20movement.jpg)). The angle of the slope certainly assists in movement (at least when gravity is not negligible); however, the type of glacier must be considered first. I'm not 100% certain on the P-T conditions on Ceres but I would assume it would not permit melting of water into liquid to permit basal slip. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The top-down generation (from the top down towards the centre) of silica within those specified dimensions is extremely difficult to generate. On Earth silicate minerals are actively broken down over time by weathering processes. As they are transported they tend to become less angular and more spherical in shape. Note that this process of weathering and erosion on Earth is promoted by active plate tectonics, water and wind. These same processes; however, are unlikely to be either active (plate tectonics or a similar mechanism) or nearly present to the same degree that they are on Earth. 

On the other hand a bottom-up model (from the centre towards the surface) readily generates the silica in the nano meter dimensions. This means that the source for the water must be at great depths, and at temperatures at which the silica can enter solution and be carried up to the surface where it precipitates out of solution. Thus the conclusion is arrived at in which there are active hydrothermal circulation paths at depth, which is eventually bringing the silica up. Such an analog on Earth may be exemplified by the [Lost City Hydrothermal Vents](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_gLv0n3B4neg/SwuWFoZlLiI/AAAAAAAAIHc/pXlrn4EIp_w/s1600/Untitled-7.png):

Speculation has been offered that ancient versions of similar hydrothermal vents in the seas of a young Earth are the birthplace of all life, constituting the original abiogenesis. - [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_City_Hydrothermal_Field)     </TEXT>

*It definitely sends asteroids and comets our way and, in any given year, more than 90 percent of all objects crossing Earth's orbit are asteroids, so the protection Jupiter provides us from long period comets, or by eventually removing short period comets, is of lesser importance. Hence Jupiter is not the friend that it has been perceived to be.* - [Villain in Disguise: Jupiter's Role in Impacts on Earth](http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/villain-in-disguise-jupiters-role-in-impacts-on-earth/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been trying to wrap my head around what the pH values might imply

The water is less than 4 percent salinity, has a pH between 8.5 and 10.5...

The water is reasonably basic which suggests that there could be a good portion of alkali metals or alkaline oxides in solution. The question is what is the immediate source? Is it coming from the alteration of minerals alone, is it coming from potential components of microbial life as they break-down, is it a byproduct of microbial life...

The size of the silica particulate (nm) may help answer some of those questions, but it's important to note that Earth's silica based life are photosynthetic in their nature, something Enceladus would most likely lack all together. I'm unaware of any analogs on Earth that would be suggestively comparable (Chemosynthetic life forms, extremophiles, etc.)  </TEXT>

In water, absorption is [strong in the red and weak in the blue](http://www.lisalaserusa.com/wp-content/uploads/spektrum-revolix.jpg), thus red light is absorbed quickly in the ocean leaving blue.

Let's shed some light and see if we can't gain a deeper perspective as to why it's actually quite easy to think of Mars as essentially barren, except possibly, for its ocean(s) at that time in its history (were they [purple oceans?](http://www.astrobio.net/topic/solar-system/earth/biosphere/did-earth-have-purple-oceans/)). Using Earth as an analog:

The 1^st widely accepted fossil evidence of microbial (simple) life on Earth is dated to ~[3.5](http://phys.org/news/2013-01-earliest-evidence-life-billion-years.html)Ga (Ga = billion years ago). Nearly 1.067 billion years *after* the formation of the Earth.

It took another ~1.3 billion years until the 1^st stage of the [Great Oxidation Event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event) to occur (around 2.3Ga) and it would take an additional ~1.45 billion years for oxygen to begin to accumulate into the atmosphere after all the natural sinks had filled. We have now endured a total of 3.65 billion years since the formation of the Earth and all there are, are microbes in the ocean. 

The earliest complex life, the [Ediacara biota](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ediacaran_Biota), didn't arrive until ~635 million years ago. After many more millions of years of evolution the 1^st fossil evidence of land plants didn't occur until the [mid-Ordovician](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_history_of_plants#Colonization_of_land), ~470Ma (Ma = Million years ago), and the 1^st macroscopic fossil evidence doesn't arrive until ~[433](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooksonia)Ma.

Of course there are plenty of other mysteries around some points in the evolution of life on Earth... what triggered the Cambrian explosion of life? What role, if any, did [Snow Ball Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth) play as it came out of the Gaskiers glaciation? etc. Keep in mind that we also need to consider the evolution of the solar system and what stage it was at as well. For example, the sun [wasn't as luminous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_young_Sun_paradox) billions of years ago, what affect would that have on Mars?  

All that being said I hope the above is enough to highlight why it's not so hard to see Mars, in its earliest stages, as essentially barren noting that the terrestrial Earth was essentially rocky and barren until ~4.097 billion years after its formation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh yes, I'm well aware that it's a text book / ideal soil profile (the image I provided in my previous comment) and that not all horizons may be present, developed, and some may even repeat throughout the profile.

It is possible that this "soil" is just mainly composed of sand.

That's where my qualm comes in. "Sand, not soil' seems incorrect to say even if [this soil](http://i.imgur.com/bLjsalb.jpg) / horizon is simply primarily composed of sand. In my opinion it seems to fit the description of what a soil is:
Soil is the mixture of minerals, organic matter, gases, liquids, and myriad organisms that together support plant life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So soil, as far as I was aware, can be divided into distinct [horizons](https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/11/flashcards/99011/png/soil_horizon.png), of which each horizon has its own composition... sand is [one of the components](http://www.soilsensor.com/images/soiltriangle_large.jpg) of soil. Can you clarify then what you mean by "sand, not soil'?

Edit: For clarity, I used the 'text book' soil profile image *not* to say that all soils should exhibit this structure, but merely to describe that soils have horizons (however poorly or exceptionally well defined they may be, should they even be present to begin with).  </TEXT>

If you're interested; however, I would suggest reading [Earth as an Evolving System](http://www.lnu.edu.ua/faculty/geology/phis_geo/fourman/library-Earth/Earth%20as%20an%20Evolving%20Planetary%20System_0120883929.pdf) (pdf) that may help you explore your question further, specifically under Ch. 6 - The Atmosphere and Oceans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...life started 2 billion years ago...

Minor correction. Add an additional 1.5 billion years to that value for the 1^st preserved fossil evidence of life on Earth (i.e. ~3.5Ga). Life must have also had to evolve prior to the fossil evidence so you can extend the existence of life on Earth prior to 3.5Ga... but who knows how far back you can extend it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to your brief summary I'd like to add some insightful links for anyone interested in further details. There are a number of books available that provide great information, though admittedly they may not be very 'user friendly' to most lay persons. 

The 1^st book is fairly costly: [Comets: Nature, Dynamics, Origin, and their Cosmogonical Relevance](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/product/9781402034909-item.html?s_campaign=goo-PLATest mkwid=yevPjqFu_dc pcrid=44154474422 s_campaign=goo-Shopping_Books gclid=CK2DlubR6sMCFWfJtAodxGkA_g); however, if you're really keen   interested, it can be found online (pdf).

The 2^nd book is a compilation of scientific papers, and is currently still available for free in individual paper form (pdf): [Comets II](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/CometsII/download.html)

The 3^rd book is provided in the same format as Comets II, and you can compile the pdfs using Google's search engine, and the provided titles: [Asteroids III](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/AsteroidsIII/download.html) 

As with the 2^nd   3^rd books, the 4^th and final addition is also available for free as individual pdf's that can be compiled to construct the included chapters within the book: [Meteorites and the Early Solar System II](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/MESSII/download.html) </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The outcrop itself](http://i.imgur.com/jw68ktz.jpg), was on the road down to the Buckley Bay ferry terminal just south of the Trent River. I'm not overly familiar with each formation so I'm at a bit of a loss as to whether or not it was from the coal-bearing part of the section; however, I didn't notice any coal (although my short time at the outcrop was too limited to be certain of this). In the outcrop photo, the 'burrow' was located on the far side of the road (the right hand side), and I found a small fragment believed to be derived from an ammonite (though this could be incorrect) on the near side of the photo (left hand side). 

Are the Trent River Formation and the Pender Formation one and the same? Finding papers regarding the lithostratigraphy can be somewhat confusing :| Any idea as to what the current nomenclature is?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apologize for the lack of scale, it was situated too high up in outcrop for me to actually reach it (I had to take the photo with my camera at arms length above my head). That being said it's ~9cm in length, and ~2cm in diameter. 

As far as I'm aware these are marine sediments (there were small ammonite fragments found very nearby), though I am having some difficulty determining which formation it is. It's a member of the Naniamo Group Sediments, consisting of alternating predominantly mudstone / shale with interfingered siltstone. Overlying these there appeared to be bedded, fine grain sandstone. From what I can gather, I would assume that I was within what is known as the [Pender Formation](http://www.uvic.ca/science/seos/assets/docs/PenderFT13.pdf) (pdf) though there appears to be some contention regarding its provenance depending on the region of study ranging from coastal plain and deltaic deposits with marine tongues, to shelf/slope deposits and even deep marine deposits.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> During my degree I did a bit of research on the tectonics of Io - it's pretty interesting seeing as Io has the tiniest fraction of water (something quite common correlated to volcanism on Earth). In fact, Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, all of which, is due to tidal heating.  

What you're looking at is [one](http://www.windows2universe.org/jupiter/images/JPL_io_interior_gif_image.html) of Io's active volcanic regions known as Tvashtar Catena. This particular area has seen eruptions reaching ~ 385km in height and spreading over 700km! If that were on Earth, it would nearly cover the entire state of Alaska.    

This particular eruption:
An eruption on Tvashtar on February 26, 2007 was photographed by the New Horizons probe as it went past Jupiter en route to Pluto. The probe observed an enormous 330 kilometres (210 mi) high plume from the volcano, with an as-yet unexplained filamentary structure made clearly visible by the background light from the sun. - [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tvashtar_Paterae) </TEXT>

<TEXT> ~~It'll be interesting to read the paper for the finer details, but to state that asteroids (and especially meteoroids) had magnetic fields seems to highly misleading. Firstly there's the size - meteoroids are far too small to have their own magnetic field, and as for asteroids... it's a bit more complicated. Some asteroids are considered to be the building blocks of planets - remnants that never became planets (thus they would never have become large enough to form a proto-planet and differentiate which would allow for a self sustaining dynamo - which gives rise to a magnetic field), while others are the remains of proto-planet debris. The study looked at pallasites, of which there are two theories regarding their formation. The most common theory is that they represent a region that was undergoing differentiation within a proto-planet. The mixture of olivine within a nickel-iron matrix suggests that they are derived from [the core-mantle region](http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/asteroid-and-meteorite-types.jpg).~~ 

~~The semantics of it all can be tricky.~~

EDIT: Read the article, and it is entirely different process of magnetic field generation. I'll certainly have to read the actual paper. Thanks for sharing OP.

Actually, typically diamonds are brought to the surface by becoming entrained in kimberlite magmas at depth. It's [well documented](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027306000588) that these are the fastest ascending xenolith bearing magmas (typical xenolith bearing magmas ascend upwards of 18km/h) with ascent rates upwards of 108km/h and exit velocities upwards of 720km/h.

<TEXT> I did a quick calculation in another thread a while ago to show why the expected earthquake is to be so large, which is as follows:

For the sake of interest, the following calculation shows the potential magnitude of the expected mega-thrust EQ. 

The rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca plate and the North American plate at the Cascadia subduction is ~4cm/yr or 0.04m/yr ([40mm/yr](http://i.imgur.com/EtlFS8F.jpg)). The article records the last great EQ occurrence on Jan. 26, 1700. Given the time since the last great EQ (2015 -1700 = 315yrs) and a rate of convergence of 0.04m/yr we can quickly calculate the expected slip distance from the accumulated deformation. 315yrs*0.04m/yr = 12.6m

The locked portion of the thrust fault is roughly [1000km long and 100km in width](http://i.imgur.com/JBDR3u1.jpg) so the area is 100,000km^2 or 1x10^11 m^2 . Before we can calculate the [Mw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale#Definition) we need to know the [Mo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_moment), where Mo = ()(area)(slip distance).   is the shear modulus and is 4.5x10^10 N/m^2 . 

Thus Mo = (4.5x10^10 N/m^2 )(1x10^11 m^2 )(12.6m) = 5.67x10^22 Nm

Plugging Mo into the equation for the moment magnitude scale we get the following:

Mw = (2/3)(Log_10Mo)-6.0

<TEXT> The problem with using coal is that it appears at different times, in different locations. Similarly, any agricultural event will be localized. In paleobiology, the best fossils are the ones that appear quickly, are well preserved, have easily recognizable morphology, have a wide range (global), and disappear suddenly. The reason for this is such that it can be used as a very precise data point for chronological analysis. Many abrupt geological events define the boundaries within geological time and while coal, etc. would certainly be considered abrupt - a better choice is the 1st atomic bomb. It, much like the K-T extinction event, leaves a global signature that is easily recognizable occurring at the same time, everywhere.        </TEXT>

<TEXT> The detection of exo-planets typically depends on the presence of a star. Analyzing how that stars light dims as the planet transits its host star. Another common method is to watch for the star to wobble. If a star is wobbling it's because there is another object acting on it, ie. a planet. In the case of bodies beyond Pluto within the [Kuiper Belt / Oort Cloud](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6949/images/nature01725-f1.2.jpg) there is no star to watch for a wobble or dimming effect. We are left to watch the orbit of other bodies within our own solar system and how they interact with one another (much like [the discovery of Neptune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto#Discovery)).  </TEXT>

There is compelling evidence that at least some of those morphological sedimentary structures are extremely improbable to create (and last), especially given their temporal, and spatial correlations if they were to be abiogenic in nature. I'm not stating that these morphological sedimentary structures are biogenic in nature; however, I wouldn't brush it off with such apparent ease as a good majority of persons appear to be doing.

Actually, they can't *just as easily* be erosional features. I suggest you read the paper, in detail if you haven't already, in which Noffke provides very compelling evidence, and even includes good arguments as to why they most likely are not erosional features. 

Your comparison to the Allan Hills Meteorite is fallacious (apples to oranges) due to the differences (although there may be some similarities) in scale. Textural features may share similar morpholigcal structures at the nano and microscopic scales between biogenic and abiogenic factors; however, at the macroscopic level distinct differences can be discerned as the similarities between morphological structures of biogenic and abiogenic factors become more distant from one another. This is what allows for the classification of [ichnofacies](http://www.sepmstrata.org/CMS_Images/SeilacherControls.gif) in geology / paleobiology.     </TEXT>

As she states herself, "...the similarities in morphology, but also in distribution patterns with regards to MISS on Earth would be an extraordinary coincidence." 

TL; DR - There is a good chance this is exactly what she has concluded they are, fossil mircobial mats.

<TEXT> No, I'm going to have to disagree with you. The *scale* of Hubble images does not permit evidence of life. On the other hand, paleobiologists and geologists use [ichnofacies](http://www.sepmstrata.org/CMS_Images/SeilacherControls.gif) (morphological sedimentary structures) to discern paleoenvironments. In essence, these are potentially 'fossils'. The added spatial and temporal correlations adds further support to the claim. 

 That's science, deal with it.

Due to the difference between an EQ of Mw  4.9 and Mw  ~8.0 it is generally accepted that no matter the number of small EQs, they (light EQs) will not be able to produce a Great EQ. I'm curious to know to what extent such a statement can reach. For example, to what extent can a number of minor EQs trigger light, moderate, strong, major, or great EQs? How close does the relation between seismic moments need to be in order for one to trigger the other?

The first calculation I did was literally [distance = speed x time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/701b935ef4072b0f79c429a0d461a6cce437f1c2.gif). I would certainly hope most people understand that. 

The next calculation I did (which I also provided a hyperlink for people to click for clarity) was for Mo which is just multiplying three basic variables together: area (which is length x width), distance, and the [shear modulus](http://wikipremed.com/01physicscards600/156a.gif) (admittedly this variable may be a knew concept to some; however, a full understanding of it isn't really required as you'll see).

The final calculation was just as simple as the previous ones. I multiplied 2/3 by the log of Mo and then subtracted 6.0 to find Mw which is 9.2. And, again I provided a link for clarity to Mw.

It's also totally meaningless because of the number of variables.

No, the number of variables present in any set of equations have no bearing on 'meaning.'

I'm sure your calculations hold some meaning

It means that the expected EQ would measure 9.2Mw (or in non-Swahili, a M9.2 on the [Richter scale](http://i.imgur.com/kVsvEzf.jpg) which is a [logarithmic scale](http://www.sms-tsunami-warning.com/theme/tsunami/img/earthquakes/richter-scale/richter_scale_graphic_representation.gif))

Given the time since the last great EQ (2015 -1700 = 315yrs) and a rate of convergence of 0.04m/yr we can quickly calculate the expected slip distance from the accumulated deformation. 315yrs*0.04m/yr = 12.6m

The locked portion of the thrust fault is roughly [1000km long and 100km in width](http://i.imgur.com/JBDR3u1.jpg) so the area is 100,000km^2 or 1x10^11 m^2 . Before we can calculate the [Mw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale#Definition) we need to know the [Mo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_moment), where Mo = ()(area)(slip distance).   is the shear modulus and is 4.5x10^10 N/m^2 . 

Thus Mo = (4.5x10^10 N/m^2 )(1x10^11 m^2 )(12.6m) = 5.67x10^22 Nm

Plugging Mo into the equation for the moment magnitude scale we get the following:

Mw = (2/3)(Log_10Mo)-6.0

Mw = (2/3)(Log_10 5.67x10^22 Nm) - 6.0

Mw = 9.2

**TL; DR** - the potential magnitude of the expected mega-thrust EQ is M9.2 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hydroxyl (OH), in geology, is generally synonymous with water. For example, when estimating water content in lunar minerals they look at the hydroxyl content, whether it be in apatite, [anorthosite](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n3/full/ngeo1735.html) or otherwise. The following isn't a perfect example given the context, but it helps to show how H2O is locked away as a hydroxyl group and a hydrogen atom: http://imgur.com/jy716Bl  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in grade three our class was taking a trip to the local swimming pool. I can remember the day, and the general route we took. We were all singing kids songs and were all excited. I was the second last in the back of the line, and we were almost there. There was one cross-walk to go across, up the sidewalk, and we were there. Looking down for a moment I noticed my shoe was untied; however, so I stopped, and knelt down to tie my laces. I was now last in line and almost everyone had crossed the cross-walk. As quickly as I could, I finished tying my laces and stood back up. Everyone had cross the cross-walk by now and I wanted to catch up as to not be left behind. I ran towards the cross-walk, and looked to my right. I couldn't tell if there was a car coming because there was a van parked just off the side of the road but it looked clear from what I could tell. I quickly looked to my left and saw a white car. It was a fair distance away; however, and if I ran I could easily make it in time before it got to the cross-walk. 

I raised my head to gather my senses. I was on a bed of some sort, on my back. There was a rush around me, and all I could really see clearly was the glint of light on the scissors as they rushed to cut through my blood soaked clothing. I remember seeing tears in their faces and hearing crying before everything faded back to black.

In the end my skull had been cracked from ear-to-ear, and I was paralyzed from the waste down. I made a relatively quick recovery I suppose and the parallelization did not last. I can recall asking my father at a young age what it was like when you're dead. He said, "Do you remember what it was like before you were born?" And, that's what it was like for me. There was simply nothing. One instant I was there, and in the blink of an eye I was gone. 

I have had a few other close calls in my life, and only once did I ever see a tunnel. It wasn't when I was going out of consciousness; however, but rather when I came to.        </TEXT>

 What weve shown here is that a runaway greenhouse atmosphere that would sterilize the planet is actually possible for Earth, with the amount of sunlight it receives now, says Goldblatt. Fortunately, it would need 10 times more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to trigger this than burning all of Earths fossil fuels  every bit of coal, oil and gas that exists - would give. - Colin Goldblatt

<TEXT> [A number of possibilities exist](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19088); however, the most likely (imo) are serpentinization^1, and methane clathrate release^2 . 

1) Serpentinization: occurs on Earth all the time, creating a group of minerals called serpentine minerals (serpentinite). When basalt - oceanic crust - (composed primarily of pyroxene, and calcic plagioclase feldspar, and minor olivine) reacts with the ocean water it alters to serpentine minerals which are hydrous (containing H2O/OH). The process is exothermic and produces methane (CH4) in the process. An interesting region on Earth in which this reaction is the key support system of life in the deep ocean is known as [Lost City](http://www.lostcity.washington.edu/science/chemistry/serpentinization.html). The general formula for the reaction is as follows:

[Olivine + water + carbonic acid  serpentine + magnetite + methane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentinite#Serpentinite_reactions)

What I find interesting is the production of magnetite, and heat from the reaction. There may be detectable magnetic anomalies in regions that are undergoing serpentinization, and there should also be anomalous heat. Not only does this have implications for future research, but the magnetite could act as a food source for bacteria, the heat provides an energy source and there is liquid water - a microbes paradise. 

2) Methane clathrates: Ancient deposits of methane could be trapped in ice [methane clathrate](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/features/200409_methane/crystal.jpg) within the subsurface. During warming episodes, or anything that may cause an insatiability (tectonism, etc.) the clathrates could become unstable, and vent into the local atmosphere causing periodic spikes.

<TEXT> I can see how the D/H values imply that given the nature of the diagram but it's more specific than that. There are [different types of asteroids / meteoroids (ites)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite_classification#Traditional_classification_scheme), of which the oldest, most chemically primitive are the [CI - Carbonaceous chondrites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonaceous_chondrite#CI_group). The Earth's bulk silicate composition is also typically presented as chondritic in composition (Chondritic Earth Model; [CHUR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope_geochemistry) - the Chondritic Uniform Reservoir). Carbonaceous chondrites, were formed in the same swirl of dust, grit, ice and gasses that gave rise to the sun some 4.6 billion years ago, well before the planets were formed. The D/H values shown as asteroids don't necessarily mean that water came from the asteroid belt, but rather that the composition of the water in the asteroids within the asteroid belt have the same composition as the Earth's water.

<TEXT> In my opinion no, although there certainly are contrasting theories between geology and astronomy that often do tend to "butt heads" (Deccan Traps vs Impact, Asteroids + Volcansim vs. Comets, Volcanism and anoxiic conditions vs. Gamma Ray Bursts,Younger Dryas and abrupt climate vs. Comet, etc.). *Most* theories, with the exception of the K-T extinction are in favour of the geological evidence, and in my opinion this is no different given the evidence. Quite honestly, [no cometary D/H values match the Earth's reservoir values](http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2014/12/first_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio/15106937-1-eng-GB/First_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio.jpg) with the exception of one example with some uncertainties that take it outside of Earth's values. Meanwhile, there are plenty of asteroids that do as you can see in the hyperlink provided. Furthermore, the geological side has [some pretty darn good evidence](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater) not only from asteroids but from the Earth itself. It seems rather difficult to claim that [the large amount of water deep within the mantle](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25723-massive-ocean-discovered-towards-earths-core.html) was incorporated at a much later time rather than being within hydrous mineral phases themselves during accretion. Adding to Earth, we can add evidence to the argument by showing that [the moon was also relatively 'wet'](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n3/full/ngeo1735.html) during its formation as well. This implies that the source material must have also been 'wet'. 

Meanwhile, as far as I'm aware, the only evidence for a cometary origin for the majority of water on Earth comes from speculation that the Earth must have been too hot to retain water during accretion and immediately after accretion, insinuating a 'magma ocean.'  As well as during the lunar impact model, and the D/H values of comet Hartley 2 (which as noted above have a degree of uncertainty that takes it out of the range required to claim a match with Earth's D/H values). The aforementioned assumption that the Earth may have been a 'magma ocean' [have been seriously questioned](http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/09/early-earth-less-hellish/). This leaves the only *somewhat* reliable evidence then for a cometary origin of Earth's water from comet Hartley 2. All that being said, it appears that the evidence is strongly in favour of the more geological argument, and I find it troubling that given the rather weak counter argument, "...[many scientists... believe that comets probably brought much of the water of the Earths oceans](http://blog.eag.eu.com/the-origin-of-life-a-long-and-winding-road/dirty-snowballs-and-our-origins/)..."

If you're going to promote a theory and make bold claims those theories and claims require strong evidence, something the cometary argument, quite honestly, *currently* lacks to a large degree. I hope that helps provide some insight into the topic in question.  

EDIT: Actually, I forgot that there is another piece of evidence for a cometary origin of water, although it is rather suspect at best given a) the counter evidence, as mentioned above with lunar water from the lunar highlands, and other values b) logically it's suspect and c) their are criticisms of their methods (ie. using apatite to derive D/H values is a questionable choice of mineral). That being said [here it is](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n2/abs/ngeo1050.html). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'll have to excuse me on this one as (in my opinion) I have a lot to learn myself in this regard to comets and their formation; however, I will attempt to answer it.

To my understanding, I don't believe comets were able to form within the early inner solar system. The "[frost line / snow line](http://www.subarutelescope.org/Pressrelease/2009/02/17/fig01_e.jpg)" (--simplified) places constraints on their formation such that water ice can only form beyond it, and typically not within it; therefore, comets only formed in the outer regions of the Solar System.    

...Deuterium outgassed over plain hydrogen

This relates to kinetic fractionation, a process that is based on mass, and is the dominant mode of isotope fractionation in low-temperature environments (space). Deuterium is [an isotope of hydrogen](http://www.wwk.in/resources/content/imagesv4/chemistry/Inorganic+chemistry/himg2.jpg) and has more mass (ie. it's heavier). This means it requires more energy to raise their vibrational energies, which implies that hydrogen will always be preferentially lost over deuterium. As a rule, bonds between the lighter isotopes are broken more easily than equivalent bonds of heavier isotopes. Hence, the light isotopes react faster, causing the residual matter to become enriched in the heavy isotopes.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If there were any comets during formation their signature has yet to be found and is lost by the overwhelming signature from asteroids, and more specifically a specific class of asteroids known as [carbonaceous chondrites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonaceous_chondrite). CI carbonaceous chondrites are considered by many researchers to be the most pristine samples of original solar system material, and for the estimated composition of Earth, their values are all in close agreement (Chondritic Earth Model, used by geologists and geochemists to normalize REE values - known as chondrite normalized). This is the basis for the chondritic model, which holds that Earth (and presumably the other terrestrial planets) was essentially built up from bodies made of such meteoritic material. This idea is corroborated by isotopic studies of rocks derived from interior regions of Earth. Further research only adds to the currently accepted theory that the water on Earth originated during planetary formation ([see latest research](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater)) and the majority was not derived from cometary sources as is further [indicated by D/H ratios](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/10/23F39F8900000578-2869018-ESA_s_Rosetta_spacecraft_has_found_the_water_vapour_from_its_tar-m-9_1418245571472.jpg). </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's really not hard to get water from comets onto the Earth.

It's even easier if the water was already locked up in hydrous minerals during accretion from chondritic asteroids, and not from a late cometary source.

To sum up from another post:
To be honest, the cometary origins of water on Earth has always been ill-favoured and misrepresented as favourable in media, and by astronomers / astrophysicists / [theoretical physicists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R16cXQBndQ t=4m31s). The argument was shown in [ESAs promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H08tGjXNHO4 t=1m45s) for the Rosetta mission, and touted by many others which is unfortunate. The vast majority of evidence is [in favour of chondritic sources](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater) and degassing from volcanism, and always has been. To see it persistently claimed that comets are the source of Earth's water is misleading and upsetting to say the least.

EDIT: [Here's a nice info graphic](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/10/23F39F8900000578-2869018-ESA_s_Rosetta_spacecraft_has_found_the_water_vapour_from_its_tar-m-9_1418245571472.jpg), which includes 67P/C-G, depicting various D/H ratios and their relation to Earth's reservoirs.

<TEXT> It's an excellent question, and certainly the right train of thought. Although this is the 1st time we have physically landed on the comet it's not the 1st time we've sampled their D/H ratio. In fact, the measurement was made by the [ROSINA instrument](http://sci.esa.int/rosetta/35061-instruments/?fbodylongid=1650) located on Rosetta which is orbiting 67P, and not by the lander Philae. We have actually sampled a lot more than 2 comets. Although difficult and uncertainties are larger, we have made several observations from Earth as well. [This image](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/10/23F39F8900000578-2869018-ESA_s_Rosetta_spacecraft_has_found_the_water_vapour_from_its_tar-m-9_1418245571472.jpg) produced by ESA shows a number of asteroids and comets and other bodies with regards to their D/H ratio and Earth. I wouldn't say that we have ruled out comets as a source or even a contributor; however, I would say that the evidence is strongly in favour of an origin relating more so to asteroids than comets. What I'm stating above is that given the current evidence, it simply doesn't make sense to promote the weaker theory as is so often seen with regards to this topic. 

That being said, we can always use bigger sample sizes and higher resolution data to form a more definitive interpretation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, the cometary origins of water on Earth has always been ill-favoured and misrepresented as favourable in media, and by astronomers / astrophysicists / [theoretical physicists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R16cXQBndQ t=4m31s). The argument was shown in [ESAs promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H08tGjXNHO4 t=1m45s) for the Rosetta mission, and touted by many others which is unfortunate. The vast majority of evidence is [in favour of chondritic sources](http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/OriginEarthWater) and degassing from volcanism, and always has been. To see it persistently claimed that comets are the source of Earth's water is misleading and upsetting to say the least.

EDIT: [Here's a nice info graphic](http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2014/12/first_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio/15106937-1-eng-GB/First_measurements_of_comet_s_water_ratio.jpg), which includes 67P/C-G, depicting various D/H ratios and their relation to Earth's reservoirs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're absolutely correct to question /u/stupidankle's explanation, because it's incorrect. Clear ice has very little to do with currents and [much more to do with the rate of freezing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChuIiAuW5m8 t=40m50s). If the water is cooled too quickly it doesn't have enough time to reject any impurities as it crystallizes - those impurities are then held within the crystal lattice and distort the crystal lattice. Thus, if there are impurities such as trapped gases, organic material and other minerals or dissolved salts (an inhomogeneous mixture) the ice will appear optically translucent, or even opaque. However, if the water cools and freezes over a longer duration of time, it has time to reject these impurities as it crystallizes. This eventually gives rise to a more homogenous mixture and less defects in the crystal lattice which creates clear, transparent water ice.

<TEXT> I should emphasize my previous statement, *in my line of work* (mineral exploration), it's not uncommon for them to crash (at least 1 fatal helicopter crash per season, most commonly with a 206). Typically, if you do here of a crash it was because as you noted... it was the wrong tool for the job, pilot error, or something overlooked by the engineer. Personally, I feel the 206's get manhandled far too easily by the elements - hence my preference for the larger helicopters especially in mountainous terrain.

<TEXT> This study provides experimental evidence that the DNA's genetic information is essentially capable of surviving the extreme conditions of *space* and the re-entry into Earth's dense *atmosphere*.

Unless it states it elsewhere within the paper itself, this says nothing for DNA being able to survive the initial ejection created by an impact event itself or the subsequent temperatures and pressures associated with the impact of the of the object itself. Furthermore, are the temperatures associated with the re-entry of a space vehicle closely approximated by those of a meteor, typically at much higher speeds? I'd be hesitant to extrapolate the findings of this study to the bigger question(s).    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd have to call it a [phyllite](http://geologycafe.com/images/m26.jpg) with biotite poryphyroblasts. 


Phyllites are typically grey to black in colour with a silky lustre on their pervasive cleavage planes due to the alignment of mica minerals. Often phyllites exhibit a crenulation cleavage which can be seen as a crenulation on the cleavage surface.
Phyllites are formed by regional metamorphism of argillaceous sediments since their cleavage arose due to deviatoric stress. Phyllite is typical of greenschist grade metamorphism. With increasing metamorphic grade increases in mica grain-size transforms phyllite into schist. However, some phyllites have experienced an overprint by contact metamorphism resulting in the growth of biotite, andalusite or cordierite porphyroblasts, these are often randomly orientated and grow across foliation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my critiques of this short is the theory that water on Earth was derived from comets. Though this theory is interesting and there is still more data to be collected, currently it is not the leading theory for the origin of water on Earth. The notion that water on Earth is derived from cometary sources is based on 1 sample, comet [Hartley 2](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368/fig_tab/nature10519_F2.html) while many others [have been ruled out](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news008.html). On the other hand, the leading theory states that Earth's water is a result of volcanic degassing with strong support from multiple studies and a plethora of evidence. For example, the deep interior of the Earth (the mantle) still contains [a large reservoir of water](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25723-massive-ocean-discovered-towards-earths-core.html) (if collected from the minerals, it would contain ~3x the volume of all the water present in the Earth's ocean). Lunar water has been discovered [in large amounts](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n3/full/ngeo1735.html) native to the moon and not derived from comets, and a good portion of that water came from interstellar sources, [older than our sun](http://www.nature.com/news/earth-has-water-older-than-the-sun-1.16011). For the most part, [extraterrestrial sources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth#Extraterrestrial_sources) (ie. Comets) for the origin of water on Earth have been ruled out.

Prior to this, as can be inferred from the animation, seismicity within the region is relatively minimal. Seismicity due to geological factors should be somewhat benign given [the potential within the region](http://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/US-FAULT-LINES.jpg) due to the intraplate location. As increased density distribution and overpressures are becoming more common with fracking, one could predict an increase in seismicity - exactly what is observed within the time interval '08 - '14.    </TEXT>

These uranium deposits, **seventeen** of which have been

Conditions earlier on in the geological record were more favourable for natural fission reactors so there is a probability that that they occurred [in more than one cluster](http://www.space.com/13795-natural-nuclear-reactors-planets-spark-life.html); however, their preservation in the geological record is poor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Next to none - these are seamounts, the vast majority of which are inactive / extinct. 

A number of statements from the USGS:
On average, human activities put out in just three to five days, the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide that volcanoes produce globally each year.

Some actual numbers:
 Our studies show that globally, volcanoes on land and under the sea release a total of about 200 million tonnes of CO2 annually. 

As per the data provided by [the Global Carbon Budget Project](http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/14/hl-compact.htm), in 2013, total anthropogenic input of CO2 was 36Gt (Gigatonnes) and is estimated to be *2.5% more in 2014*.

A comparison in annual values:

Source | Tonnes CO2 | Scientific Notation | 
---|---|----
Volcanoes | 200,000,000 | 2.0x10^8
Fossil Fuels* | 36,000,000,000 | 3.6x10^10
  Tonnes| 35,800,000,000 | 3.5x10^10 | 

*Note: Fossil fuels value is for the annual output in 2013.

So what's that mean % wise? It means that the total contribution from volcanic CO2 makes up less than one percent (0.5%) of the total CO2 in our atmosphere relative to fossil fuel input. 

EDIT: I made a quick graph to help illustrate the difference in input from each source: [Volcanoes   Fossil Fuels](http://i.imgur.com/RLYmCxq.png) </TEXT>

Some researches state that the nanodiamonds were actually [misidentified graphene/graphane-oxide aggregates](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16043.abstract), while others note that, while there are nanodiamonds, [they are not the form found due shock-induced mechanisms and nor are the carbon spherules](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/1/40.full.pdf). Furthermore, the handling of the *evidence* by proponents of the YD impact hypothesis is appalling and [no one can duplicate their  findings](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/21/E2162).

I appreciate your staunch attitude towards the idea; however, if you read through the material I've provided in the links above, along with the ones within this submission, you'll find that [there simply is no evidence](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/43/18155.full) for an impact event and nor is one required to explain the Younger Dryas event. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was unable to see the flashes that you mention; however, volcanic lightening is certainly a possibility and is actually fairly common in volcanic plumes. It's a relatively new field of study so there are still many unanswered questions. That being said, the leading theory is that it forms as a result of electric charges building up in the ash-laden plume of an eruption. Ash particles are bits of pulverized volcanic rock less than 2 mm(or 1/12 of an inch) in diameter, and although they may look like smoke from a distance, the fact that theyre composed of rock means that they can, under the right conditions, conduct electricity. A significant portion of the gas escaping a volcano is composed of water vapor  we all know that wet things conduct electricity better  and some researchers think that ice crystals forming from water vapor in the column freezing at higher altitudes can also increase the electrical conductivity of the plume.

Cimarelli, C *et al*., successfully replicated at least one manner in which volcanic lightening is generated (video of experiment [**1**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QoiTcQcyTY)   [**2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2XHFtKgq5s)) and noted that there are ideal conditions for creating volcanic lighting. Cimarelli *et al*. found that electrical discharges only happened with specific size ranges of the ash, at certain points in the experimental process: finer ash produced a larger number of discharges concentrated in the turbulent shell around the larger particles in the core of the plume, and when the fines-rich turbulent portion went away, discharges stopped. When they repeated the decompression experiments with glass beads instead of volcanic ash, they were also able to suggest several mechanisms for building charges. In plumes with two different bead sizes, larger beads tended to become positively charged while smaller ones tended to negative charges, and provide a gradient for charges to want to cross; however, when the beads were all the same size in a turbulent plume, the authors suggest that there was a mix of charges, but that like charges tended to cluster and thus form the necessary gradients. The key similarity was that the plumes had to be fines-rich and turbulent; once the plume was mainly composed of larger particles, the lightning stopped.

<TEXT> this is what it must have been for pompeii and mount st-helens and for countless other

There are some key difference that make Pompeii and Mount. St. Helens different than what this looks like. In fact, Pompeii and Mount. St. Helens were likely far more terrifying. This video was of volcanic ash falling down, [suspected](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/news/20140927_32.html) to be from a [phreatomagmatic / phreatic eruption](http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Hydrovolcanic.html) due to the low temperature of the ash (though further analysis is needed). 

And while a [pyroclastic flow did occur on Mt. Ontake](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20140927/t10014927291000.html) this is not what the hikers experienced. It is, on the other hand, what the people of Pompeii and those close to Mount St. Helens experienced amongst subsequent higher temperature ash fall (burying them and cooking them in clouds of ash and toxic gases) and the initial force of the blast (which [shredded the forest](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg-Mendip-Hills/10MND-Mount-St-Helens-Tree.jpg)) and later lahar flows.

While this would still have been terrifying to experience, it's far removed from the likes of Pompeii and Mount St. Helens.

<TEXT> Vancouver BC is considered to be one the worlds, if not thee worlds, largest hubs for mining companies. I've been working for junior companies in mineral exploration for a number of years now, steadily - even with the swings in the market. If you put in the effort I'd have a hard time believing that you wouldn't find work in mineral exploration in Canada. 
For starters, head to major conventions for networking and other opportunities, preferably when the market is in good shape (though this isn't a direct relation it certainly helps). AME BC's [Roundup](http://www.amebc.ca/roundup-2015-home) convention is an excellent choice held in Vancouver as well as the worlds largest convention for mineral exploration and mining, [PDAC](http://www.pdac.ca/convention), held in Toronto.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're most welcome, I'm glad I was able to provide you with some new material. I'm not terribly surprised that the original paper (not this article) made it through peer-review. I would assume that the data and conclusions looked to be fairly well determined at the time. It wasn't until other scientists started looking at their work and trying to replicate their findings that they noticed the immense crock that was published. What I am surprised at is that, from my knowledge, the original paper was never retracted. Firestone *et al*. continue to publish and continue their bad science... just this year their results for another area of research were [found to be utter bunk](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1406/1406.5141.pdf).

#Here are a few responses I've compiled regarding this topic (the article linked by OP is unfortunately atrociously bias and extremely ignorant of the plethora of solid research that refutes this idea) 

Post One:
___
For any of the uninformed on the subject, specifically the YD ([Younger Dryas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas)) and the overwhelming problems surrounding the [impact hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_event#Criticism), I can provide a few links to previous discussions regarding it and the other well established views regarding the YD event at the bottom of my comment for anyone who's interested. Needless to say, this article references James Kennett who is well known for his work [with Firestone *et al*](http://imgur.com/a/OpUMC) - who are notoriously known within the scientific community for promoting bunk science and refusing to address key issues with their work and the criticisms of others. The credibility of Firestone consortium is not without serious questioning as [this article](http://www.psmag.com/science/comet-claim-comes-crashing-to-earth-31180/) brings to notice. 
#Links to previous discussions regarding the impact hypothesis

- Probably the most useful link with links to papers [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/19j1ly/comet_killed_clovis_culture_evidence_doesnt/c8omfvv)
- Spatiotemporal dynamics of the Clovis-Folsom transition (Collard et al., 2010) and criticisms of the methods and techniques used and claimed by Firestone *et al.* [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1a3mk9/ancient_americans_were_not_wiped_out_by_a_comet/c8uqkbb?context=3)  
- Although already posted in the 1st link, it's important to read to understand that even an air-burst event has been refuted by credible scientists. [here](http://beforeitsnews.com/science-and-technology/2013/01/clovis-comet-hypothesis-called-bogus-by-credible-scientist-2532500.html) 

___

Post Two:
___
The underlying event that is being referred to in this article is the  [Younger Dryas stadial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas). Several theories have been proposed and to date, the best theory is the [draining of Lake Agassiz](http://www.blc.arizona.edu/courses/schaffer/182h/Climate/Was%20the%20Younger%20Dryas%20Triggered%20by%20%20a%20Flood.pdf) proposed by Wallace S. Broecker. Note that in the paper by Broecker a flood path was not known - this was in 2006. In 2010 [the flood path was found](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7289/full/nature08954.html), confirming the draining of Lake Agassiz. However, Firestone et al. proposed that the cause was derived from an [extraterrestrial impact](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016.full.pdf). Firestone and his team are well known for trying to push this hypothesis over the years and even recently; however, it's *evidence* has been refuted [on more than one occasion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_hypothesis#Criticism). More to the roots of this article though, the end the prehistoric Clovis culture is a non-issue. In the words of [Mark Boslough](http://beforeitsnews.com/science-and-technology/2013/01/clovis-comet-hypothesis-called-bogus-by-credible-scientist-2532500.html): 
Just because a culture changed from Clovis to Folsom spear points didnt mean their civilization collapsed, he explained. They probably just used another technology. Its like saying the phonograph culture collapsed and was replaced by the iPod culture."

<TEXT> One could ask themselves a couple of questions regarding plate tectonics which may lead to an interesting view. Is plate tectonism identical under all conditions? Has plate tectonics on Earth evolved or changed over geologic time? Given the degree of variability within the known universe, let alone our own solar system, is constraining our definition of plate tectonics to the model we have constructed from our data on Earth perhaps somewhat limiting? 

Given the above, I wouldn't say that it's *not truly plate tectonics* but rather that the term *plate tectonics* is the umbrella term underneath which there exists a host of subtypes or classes. Rocky, Cryo, and otherwise. 

Here's an [image](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/14-241_0.jpg) with the following description:
Conceptual model for subduction. Recycling of surface area through the subduction of a cold, brittle, outer portion of the ice shell into its warmer interior, where it is ultimately subsumed. Potential cryolavas are forced to the surface through the overriding plate. The higher density of the subducting outer ice layer obviates buoyancy-induced topographic relief at the site of subduction. Plate collision results in contractional deformation in the overriding plate along the collisional margin, creating the tabular subsumption bands. -Nature Geoscience (2014) doi:10.1038/ngeo2245

<TEXT> This is immense. Currently Earth is the only known celestial object that is known to have active plate tectonics. If the evidence stands the test of time and it ends up holding true, it could enrich our understanding of plate tectonics - currently, the only type or class of plate tectonics that we have a relatively good grasp of is in regards to rocky material. The plates on Europa are made of ice and thus the dynamics will differ... but by how much?

Doesnt the core of a body need to be rather active to still have "moving" plates?

As I alluded to above, this is precisely my point. This would likely hold true(ish) if it they were rocky plates, but they're not. Perhaps they're driven by tidal forces or some other forces (phase changes?), etc.

<TEXT> Sure thing. 

Roughly 400Ma (400 million years ago) during the [Devonian](http://www.geosociety.org/science/timescale/timescl.pdf) North America was situated along the equator ([fig. 1](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/rcb7/namD385.jpg))([fig. 2](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/rcb7/400_Devonian_2globes.jpg)). At that time, British Columbia didn't exist as a part of North America and the [continental shelf](http://jjustinianomarinescience.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/0/9/17099444/511816488_orig.gif) was essentially located along where the Alberta border would later be defined in the south. 400Ma, the coast of North America was a warm, tropical, shallow water environment (see fig 1   2) and coral reefs were numerous - this is seen in the lower most Formations ([Fairholme   Palliser](http://paulzizkaphotography.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/rundlegeology.jpg)) as thick limestone deposits. Plate tectonics never ceased and North America was on the move - this time; however, the waters were getting deeper, colder, and with less oxygen. Thus deposits went from ancient reefs and shallow water deposits to deeper, finer sediments like silt and clays that would later form shale, forming the Banff / Exshaw Formation. This shale formation erodes more readily than the limestone formations, hence its appearance. The scene was about to change again - this time the seas were retreating and as North America continued its migration the environment was changing from deep water deposits back to shallow marine deposits. This leads to the top most formation known as the Rundle Formation. Millions of years would pass (~150) and North America would continue to shift - eventually around 80Ma to 90Ma North America would collide with a large land mass (termed the [Insular Terrane](http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/student/seigel1/tectonic_evolution/physio_belt_map.jpg)), unable to be subducted, which would provide the energy to deform, [folding and faulting](http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/geology/publications/state/tx/1968-7/images/fig26.jpg) the ancient deposits and thrusting the thick units atop one another. Millions more years worth of weathering and erosion have left [what you see today](http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/glac/3/images/fig3.jpg) (or an animation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZARSY4TMO6Y t=0m20s)). I hope that wasn't overly complicated and if you have any questions, I'd be happy to try and explain it either more clearly or in more detail.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rust coloured rocks are most likely from ARD (acid rock drainage) and need not be associated with mining activity (it can occur naturally by various means). The white colour is more perplexing though I would suspect that sources of the influx would share a common parent. You have stated that the area in which they were located were between Anaktuvuk and Wiseman which are in the area of the Brooks Mountain Range - an area that has geothermal activity ([Reed River hot springs](http://jlc-web.uaa.alaska.edu/client/en_US/testy/search/detailnonmodal;jsessionid=183CBD47D48FAFBA47D06B790127B8F2?qu=Special+report d=ent%3A%2F%2FSD_ILS%2F259%2FSD_ILS%3A259082~ILS~0~5722 ps=300), and others). My assumption is that there may be pulses of activity reaching the surface with elevated [iron, sulphur, and pyrite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_mine_drainage#Chemistry) leading to the colouration of the stream(s). The white is likely associated, though perhaps it's following a different pathway or simply originating from a different pulse of fluids (perhaps rich in colloidal silica, carbonate or another). Regardless, there is most certainly a change in pH and it could also be from bacterial activity (or at least in part) as well; however, my primary cause is some sort of influx via hydrothermal fluid input.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had never been to Saskatchewan before this summer and of course was filled with... we'll say, minimal excitement regarding the terrain. Of course I had succumb to the stereotype far too often portrayed... flat, with a lot of lakes. Now don't get me wrong, it certainly is flat relative to B.C. (where I grew up) and it certainly does have a lot of lakes, but there's a beauty to be seen even within such a simple landscape. It wasn't until a few weeks in, returning to camp from the field in the helicopter, that it all sank in. The image of the lodge pole pines poking out of the thick moss brought back particular memories: [lunch break](https://www.flickr.com/photos/luxlaboratories/14419704601/sizes/l). I'd like to go back and explore some of the areas you've shown - there's a lot of land mass and evidently, a lot to see. The rest of my shots from the Saskatchewan based property can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/luxlaboratories/sets/72157644764865100/) if you're interested.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> That mineral could only be produced under massive pressure and heat

In referring to Jadeite, this is incorrect. Jadeite is associated with blueschist facies mineral assemblages which are produced in subduction zones. Here, the pressures are high, however, the geothermal isobars are [suppressed](http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/structure/dynamicearth/subduction/thermalbig.gif) giving rise to low temperatures. In other words Jadeite is a High-P low-T mineral.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen it time and time again and it's an easy error to make, confusing tectonics with plate tectonics. I hope the explanation has cleared up any misconceptions around some requirements for plate tectonics. I should state that while there are some basic physical and chemical principles that must be applicable to all forms of plate tectonics, there may be other forms of plate tectonics that differ from how plate tectonics occurs on Earth. 

As per the downvote, I never downvote. Simply because someones understanding may be somewhat limited is no cause to downvote, in my opinion; It's an invitation to clear up any misconceptions or to discuss some details regarding a specific topic. If you have any other questions feel free to ask and hopefully I can shed some light or, in the very least, refer you to some information that can. Cheers.     </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I don't think we can rule out lunar plate tectonics quite yet

Actually we can. While the moon is still tectonically active it lacks a) lithospheric plates and b) it lacks a prime requirement for plate tectonics as we know it, water. 

- [The critical importance of water to plate tectonics](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm) 

While the moon certainly still has [regions of melt](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/508668main_lunar_core_lg.jpg) and may lead to volcanism in the [geological future](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/17/moon-volcanoes), the connection between a region of partial melt and plate tectonics is quite a far stretch. There are numerous bodies with active interiors, including Jupiter's moon Io; however, without water it also lacks plate tectonics, it's mountains generated through tectonism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes absolutely, they need not even form typical vertical columns either, rather they may form [fans, chevrons, rosettes, and basin patterns](http://www.glgarcs.net/images/columnar/joint_patterns.gif).  

- The fan pattern is formed when the lava flowed into a valley.

- The chevron pattern is formed when the lava has more than one cooling surface and joints propagate from each surface.

- The rosette pattern is formed when the lava spouted from a point has a domed cooling surface.

- The basin pattern is formed when isotherms curved attributed to the topography under the lava.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hot lava contracts as it cools and therefore it is widely accepted that the cooling process creates the vertical jointing. However, the exact mechanisms of this process is not well defined and depend on the location as well (different location = different variables). Under *ideal* conditions, lava will be of uniform composition and density, will have a flat surface, and so will cool evenly. When lava cools, it contracts, and therefore it would contract evenly. [This figure](http://www.glgarcs.net/images/columnar/columnar_model.gif) demonstrates how this contraction would cause regular fractures.  If physically uniform lava with the flat surface is static and cools evenly, the lava contracts equally with many centers of contraction across the surface. Each contraction area represents a circle due to physical uniformity. As it contracts, cracks, *ideally* hexagonal, are formed among the circles. These cracks extend into the lava, forming parallel hexagonal columns. However, since the lava may not cool evenly and other variables will change depending on composition and location, columns including five-sided and seven-sided columns are created as well as six-sided columns. Ideally, these fractures would be regularly spaced and organized in the shapes of regular hexagons, creating a tessellation of linked hexagons that could be seen from above. 

It forms polyhedrons due to efficiency of compaction and it must compact due to cooling (*generally*, matter becomes more dense as it cools and less dense as it heats up). Dessication cracks (mud cracks), though not due to cooling, must form as well due to the loss of water. If the surface material loses water it must contract to accommodate the loss - it contracts similarly to the figure above and polyhedrons are therefore the end result.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Primordial Asteroids in Trojan Orbits? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-03 03:56:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I understand that there exists asteroids ([trojans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_%28astronomy%29)) that typically are found at key points known as [Lagrangian points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point) (some more stable over time than others). Is it possible for a trojan / primordial asteroid to be within a planets orbit today that was present during the planets formation? 
For example, if one were to analyze [such a trojan](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23332-astrophile-mighty-trojan-found-marching-with-uranus.html) would it be representative of the overall geochemical characteristics of the planet it is in orbit with? Or, put another way - does it make sense to [look at the composition of trojan asteroids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_trojan_asteroid) and apply that to a planets overall geochemistry (as opposed, for example, to the [chondritic Earth model](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/114281/chondritic-model))?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking at three options, the [Adidas Ironworks III](http://www.dynamic-eleiko.com/products/IWIII08FRS.html), the [Pendlay Weightlifting Shoe](http://www.muscledriverusa.com/2013-Pendlay-Weightlifting-Shoes_c_715.html), or the [Rogue Do Win](http://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-weightlifting-shoes.php). I'm not a fan of ordering over the internet as it's untimely, and the fit may not be right, not only with shoe sizing but with the shoe design itself. Given the above, I'm looking for a place in Victoria that may carry any one of these shoes. Does anyone own a pair? If so, how did you acquire them? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Which one is reality? The State of Dreaming or Being Awake </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-10 10:07:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I would state that a possible solution lies within the finely tuned universe - When one is awake, they experience reality, when one is dreaming they experience a simulated version of reality. My reasoning is as follows: Within the state of being awake, physical reality follows specific *laws* as it must. Chemical, physical, and mathematical laws are all adhered to based on the '*tuning*' of our universe. When one is within the state of dreaming, the *laws* that have been set in place via the fine tuning of our universe are no longer strictly adhered to. This is to say that such laws as the Second law of thermodynamics (entropy always increases - probably the supreme of all natural laws) can be violated. Should such a law be able to be violated requires that the fine tuning of our universe be different such that the violation is permitted; however, as is noted with gravity, if the expansion of space had overwhelmed the pull of gravity in the newborn universe, stars, galaxies and humans would never have been able to form. If, on the other hand, gravity had been much stronger, stars and galaxies might have formed, but they would have quickly collapsed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the experience of dreaming must be a simulated reality as it exists within a state that must violate known laws from time to time. Such violations require a universe of a different tuning and if a different tuning were set, the universe would not exist such that it permitted our existence to begin with. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-09-12 08:13:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I came across a number of rocks around our main camp. The only conclusion I could come to was that the crystals were quartz pseudomorphs after [lamellar calcite](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2072/2251719483_2ab7091eac_z.jpg); however, I've never seen them quite like this, in such a cross cutting fashion, and I have no idea how this texture came about (I'm assuming it was lamellar calcite although it could have been something else). In an attempt to understand how lamellar calcite forms, I've yet to come across a paper that has it in any detail. Any ideas or knowledge?

<TEXT> This questions stems from a very weak grasp of the Higgs Boson (hb) and the Higgs Field (hf). Mass (in part) is derived from the interaction between the hf as particles 'feel' the field and others don't (photons).
 
[The Higgs particle, or Higgs boson, is the vestige of the simplest proposed model of what created the Higgs field in the first place.](http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/article2714897.ece)

But...

[The Higgs Boson is unstable - it lasts a fraction of a nanosecond before decaying into more stable particles](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/162362446.html?cmpid=15585797)

Given that it decays so fast (and I'm assuming that the generation of the hb is less common in the modern universe than it was in the early universe) is the hf weakening with time and as such, was the universe heavier during the earlier eras than it is today, and if so - do evolutionary models of the cosmos factor in this variable? </TEXT>

<TEXT> At a quick glance it looks like a typical hornblende, but I've never seen hornblende twin(s) before, or any other mafic mineral showing cyclic twinning producing pseudohexagonal crystals such as those formed in this specimen of [chrysoberyl](http://www.mineral-forum.com/message-board/files/folch_collection_chrysoberyl__brazil_200.jpg)...

<TITLE> Cr-Musc (Mariposite / Fuchsite) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-23 09:00:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> While doing some mineral exploration I was shown a rock (Listwanite) that contained a Cr-Muscovite, either mariposite or fuchsite. I've down some scouring on the internet and was able to read a number of older papers regarding the two but nothing definitive was said with regards on how to tell the two apart in hand sample, if it is possible. 
One of the papers stated that mariposite only occurs via hydrothermal activity and fuchsite can be both hydrothermal and metamorphic emplacement. Given this, it could be beneficial to be able to tell the difference between the two in hand sample...
Is there a way?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hyaloclastite vs Dallasite </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Is there a difference between the two? 
[Hyaloclastite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaloclastite) is a technical term that I've heard and used often, and am unconvinced that [Dallasite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallasite) is a technical term, although it does have it's own description in [mindat](http://www.mindat.org/min-27169.html) which appears to be extremely vague and...incorrect...
What's the deal with Dallasite?

<TITLE> Over rated, and over hyped - catastrophic impact event skepticism </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-03-26 03:36:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let me first start by stating that I do not doubt that impact events occur, they most certainly do; however, my skepticism is with regards to their effects. I always hear a lot of talk about [periodicity of impact events](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/08/02/new-study-finds-giant-impacts-arent-periodic/) and it really bothers me, either I haven't looked hard enough, or they are simply over rated and over hyped. To help get this across let me start by saying (to my knowledge) that there has yet to be one [definitive](http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/geoscientist/features/keller/page7669.html) impact event to cause a mass extinction. Impact events such as the Chicxulub are often quoted as occurring [every 100Ma](http://www.lakepowell.net/sciencecenter/impacts%20energy%20force.gif). If this is the case, where are the Ir layers every 0.1Ga, and the mass extinction events, and other tell tale signs? I don't see any. 
My question is this...if there is evidence that catastrophic impact events occur, other than the debated K-T boundary event, where is the evidence? Thanks for your help      </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've read a number of papers about the origin of water on the moon but one question that has persisted to evade an answer to through out, is how and why do does research get funded? What important implications does answering such a question, as to what is the origin of water on the moon, hold? Will it benefit humanity economically? Will it better constrain time frames, or conditions during the Hadean and if so why are those answers important? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pallasite preservation </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-02-11 23:19:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been wanting to add a pallasite sample to my rock collection and I've been looking into it for a bit now and noticed some on eBay that are relatively inexpensive; however, they are the "[rusters](http://www.arizonaskiesmeteorites.com/AZ_Skies_Links/Stony_Irons/index.html)" and are unstable. Looking at the stable pallasites is far out of my price range at the moment, and likely for some time so it got me wondering...
A) What is it about their composition that makes one stable vs. unstable?
B) Couldn't you just vacuum seal a "ruster" to prevent it from rusting and falling apart?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dust size (check), km size (check), intermediate size (?) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm curious to know if, and what, progress has been made with regard to planet formation. My current understanding is that we have a good idea as to how dust size particles can come together through the electrostatic force. Furthermore, we also have a decent understanding of how km size objects can impact each other and amalgamate (through gravitational attraction) into larger bodies. But, what about the intermediate sized objects? How do they come together to form the km sized bodies?
There would be no electrostatic force involved and I would assume their gravity would be too small to have any great effect within the time frame that we believe our solar system formed in... </TEXT>
