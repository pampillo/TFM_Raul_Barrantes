<TEXT> Shortly before my friends birthday i got a huge stache o different drugs to get us through a weekend. She didnt know yet and we had only done molly until then. She lives relatively far away from me so she came to me for a weekend to celebrate (Were 15-16 at the time). So we start the night of with a nice Glass of Rimus (nonalcoholic Whine) and then I Showed her what I got for the night. We both took 2 pills of high potent 120mg mdma ([I think it was these](https://www.ecstasydata.org/images/display/4000/4806_lg.jpg) and one 2cb pill. I crush and snort mine and we put on the movie Project X and wait. So it starts kicking in and we both have a pleasant evening with weird visuals. We awake the next morning and start the day with breakfast and a walk with my moms dogs. For Lunch I serve some pizza and Cider with 3 crushed up xanax in it. As soon as it kicks in we both just kinda lay on the bed, happy. Soon we fell asleep and as we wake up in the evening and I make a 5 star meal out of maccaroni and cheese. As my parents leave for a night out I show her a bag of shrooms I had previously bought (maybe 5-6g of really potent shrooms). We at first only eat two shrooms each because the dealer warned about how strong these ones were and about his experiences with them. We wait about half an hour and decide to go out a little. When we were outside for about an hour and a half we started to think the shrooms werent going to kick in so we went back to my house and she ate about three shrooms more and I ate what was left (so 4g in total for me). We went dowstairs and sat on a sofa with my two younger sisters who had no clue (By then our pupils were huge). We then went back upstairs as we were beginning to feel something and heard my fucking parents come back from the night out. It was about 10 p.m and we were both really paranoid and freaking out if we were to be caught, so we locked ourselfes in the bathroom. Right then the full effect hits us and we are both lying on the floor on a  [rug](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Fz5en%2BbrL._SL1200_.jpg) experiencing the most overwhelming waves of euphoria I have ever experienced. I looked at her and her facial features were changing positions on her face, like her eyes went onto her cheek and stuff like that and I laughed really hard. We silently moved back into my room and decided to watch fifty shades of grey (because she wanted and found it hilarious) but I couldnt log into my computer as everything was written in an alien language and moving constantly. We talked really long about who knows what and I cant everything we did afterwards, but I wandered out of my room and left her on the bed one time. I thought my house was overgrown by a magical forest and everywhere were ancient ruins and stonecarvings. One of my sisters usually sleeps with an open door and when I came by it I saw a cyan glow and whispering so I decided to check it out. I just stood in the doorway and looked in her room for a moment and was glad she wasnt awake. When I went back in my room and went out on the balcony with my friend, we felt like we were on a different planet and we could see alien trees growing rapidly. As we stared into the void of space above us, I felt like gravity could set out at any moment and I could fall forever into the void until I would hit another planet or star. 

TL;DR: Got a wide arrangement of drugs for my friends birthday. On friday we tripped on mdma and 2cb, on saturday we chilled on xanax and got the most intense trip off our lives from really strong shrooms. </TEXT>

It was an animated series about a boy and his dog and in one Episode he had a spaceship in wich they would travel to an alternate dimension, where reality was twisted and absurd. The boy loses his dog and finds him later on as he gets arrested for not being weird as all the other creatures, as an officer who should decide over his fate. The parents dont know anything about his space travels </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definetly our last day. We had a huge show, where the students off our school could show off their project to the teachers, wich we had done for the last half year. After the top 10 projects got announced (including mine :), we all got a check for 50 bucks and could go on stage and show off our Project to about 250 Parents. After that most off us (the students only) went to a little cottage that someone rented for the afterparty. Loud Music, Alcohol and snacks for everyone. Some had never drank alcohol before, without saying it was pretty funny. Some shy students got completly out off hand on the dance floor and did some stupid shit. It was a pretty great night and everyone got into drunk little conversations and maybe even found a new friend. I got home save with my friend at around 2:30.  </TEXT>
