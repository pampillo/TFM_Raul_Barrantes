<TITLE> I finally found the love of my life last night. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> People tend to neglect their true feelings, preferring to let them flutter about in their innards without any hope of ever seeing the light of day. You all know how it plays out: someone catches your eye, you fall in love, and you desperately want to tell them how you feel, but the anxiety shackles this feeling to your heart and slowly squeezes your ribcage until it suffocates. Im 26-years-old, and I long for the day when social anxiety disorder permanently loosens its ice-cold grip. Last night, however, I somehow managed to conjure up enough confidence while on a leisurely stroll.


I marveled at her beauty, which resurrected any hope I thought Id lost many years ago. I knew Id never love another woman as I do her. Our conversations were so fluid that there was never a dull moment. With blades of grass lightly poking through our clothing and into our skin, everything came to a silence as we enjoyed the night sky. It grew so silent that I dont recall her speaking another word that night. She seemed comfortable in my warm embrace, and I was elated beyond measure. 

We went to my apartment an hour or so later, shivering and exhausted. I laid her down by the fireplace in my living room and got a fire going. I gripped her hand tighter and tighter to confirm that shed never leave me. When the fire died, I took her upstairs to my bedroom. She was getting colder as I lied her down on the bed, so I pulled the covers over her and layered the bed with extra blankets to trap the heat. I knelt by her side and stared straight into her eyes. Her darkened iris was illuminated by the moonlight, sharing an intimate moment with me. With my left hand, I lightly grazed her cheek, which made her grin. I jumped into bed and aligned himself along her backside and wrapped my arm around her to bring her closer. My body heat alleviated the chill that had taken over her body.

I brushed her hair aside so that I could kiss her neck. I made my way to her ear and whispered, I love you. Dont ever leave me. We made love that night, further confirming that I found the beautiful woman I felt I deserved. I held her tighter so that the feeling would never subside. My heated breath massaged her back throughout the night to let her know that I was still there. The moon progressed across the sky, eventually disappearing from the sight of the bedroom window and stealing what little light we had. I could no longer see the characteristics responsible for her beauty as it had gotten too dark. I knew though, however, that she was right there with me and that Id get to see her again in the morning once the sun had risen.

Her name was Alice Brannon. Her obituary was so wonderfully written that I knew Id found the perfect woman to fill the void in my life. From the moment I dug her up, not once did I feel like I was being judged.

My sleeping beauty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a perfect example! I neglected to explain a crucial component of exposure therapy, which is a ranking system where you rank things that cause you anxiety on a scale of 0-100 (higher being more anxiety-provoking). 

You're supposed to start on the lower end and work your way up as you go. Going to that party was definitely up there. But yeah, keep at it, man. Be consistent, work your way up, and eventually you'll be unstoppable! 

Feel free to pm me if you want to talk about it more. I've been doing this for 4 years now and it's changed my life significantly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exposure therapy, which basically means putting yourself in anxiety-provoking situations. 

One time in college I went to a party where I knew absolutely no one. I didn't drink, smoke weed or anything that would've taken the edge off. As the night went on, I felt more comfortable and even started talking to some very nice people.

It's scary at first, but keep doing what scares you most and you'll make great progress. </TEXT>

I listen to Lori Harder's "Earn Your Happy" podcast and it really helps my anxiety/depression. There's a world of sources out there to help you, just keep digging! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Woah, dude. So sorry to hear about this. I went through a very similar thing when I was in grad school late last year. Everything went wrong at once, including my cat after I took him to the vet for a routine physical exam and the veterinarian determined he had multiple myeloma. I was desperate to save him and spent all my grad assistantship money on meds and treatments. He died 3 weeks later and I was a total wreck. This happened at the same time I learned grad school wasn't for me and dropped out, also when my girlfriend at the time didn't have the heart to break up with me in person so she sent an email without any explanation instead.

Feel free to PM me if you need to talk it over, buddy. I'm more than happy to provide a listening ear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a freelance Copywriter, I don't do many interviews in-person or over the phone. Usually just exchange some emails back and forth to get a feel for a project.

This one guy from a small tech company required some writing samples before we went ahead with his project. I accidentally attached a short screenplay I wrote that's extremely crude and violent. It was about a husband and wife who discuss how the husband potentially received a grisly wound on the side of his neck after a night of heavy drinking. It's revealed in the end that she tried to kill him while he was asleep, but she was too drunk herself to be accurate. She tossed the gun in the garbage thinking he was dead and figured she'd deal with it in the morning when she was sober. The next day, he realizes it was her after he goes to vomit in the trashcan where she left the gun. He pulls out the gun, encased in vomit, and shoots her in the head like 6 times.

The dude replied like an hour later saying he decided to pursue other candidates. Oh well, at least someone read my screenplay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Peep Show started dropping in quality in the last few series imo. It just didn't have the magic and constant laughs of the first 4 or 5 series. I do like that Mark and Jeremy end up at square one again. Still one of my favorite comedies of all time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am in need of a change of scenery as I've spent far too long (18 years) in Raleigh, NC. Minneapolis has been on my radar for the past 6 months, but I don't know exactly where I should live. Here are some details to help you guys help me:

- I am a 24, almost 25 year-old male.
- I'd like to be in a super walkable, bike-friendly area with easy access to public transit. I got in a car accident recently and decided I'm going to live car-free instead. I've heard it's easy to do depending on where in MPLS you live.
- I'd like to be as close to the action as I can within my budget. I like having a good nightlife scene, craft beer, restaurants, shopping, live music etc. within a walking distance, bike ride or short bus ride away.
- It has to be relatively safe (not everywhere is perfect, but I don't want to fear for my life on the regular)
- I currently work part time in retail and part time as a copywriter independent contractor. I'm looking for copywriting/creative writing work in general fulltime. Not sure if that really tells you anything as I'm sure these jobs are spread all throughout the city.
- I'm only looking for a studio apartment (min: $500, max: $850/month)

If there's any other information you need to inform your answer, I'd be more than happy to provide that. Thanks in advance!

<TEXT> There is nothing more haunting than the unknown. The thing about the unknown is that its not in your presence, you are in its presence. One October night, about 2 weeks before Halloween, I couldnt decide whether I was in the presence of the living and breathing, or the dead and silent.

I was in my living room relaxing in my favorite chair and watching television. Immediately to the right of my chair was a side table with a lamp jutting from the red oak finish. Beyond the table were a set of windows that decorated the entire wall. If you peeked through the glass, you would be looking at our small outdoor deck with a grill and a few steps that lead to the backyard grass. Despite my numerous protests since moving into that house, my parents insisted that we never closed the blinds, even at night. 

My parents were in a slumber upstairs while I watched television late at night. Even if I werent paying attention, I preferred to keep the T.V. on when its dark outside. I hate dead silence; If Nothing were a living being, I hated when it stroked my spine with its cold, jagged nails. I liked the house to be filled with some sort of noise that quelled the silent soundtrack orchestrated by Nothing.

While Ive always maintained that the light is a friend at nighttime, it betrays you when you cant see out of the windows. I kept the lamp on the table next to me lit as I got deeper into the movie. Before I flicked the light on, I knew what was beyond the window. The moon reminded me what Id see the next day: my deck, the grass, the naked trees, and the red leaves that peppered the lawn. When the lamp illuminated the living room, Its as if the light painted the windows black.

Nearing 4 in the morning, I decided that it was time to call it a night. I turned the T.V. off and took a minute to motivate myself to get out of my chair. I twisted the lamps switch to submerge the living room into darkness. Once again, the windows appeared transparent and showcased the world beyond the glass. However, the light of the moon revealed a new feature that disrupted my routine viewing. 

A pale, crooked face was staring right back at me.

Whoever or whatever it was, it stood there on the deck. Only a glass window with numerous hand prints on it separated us. The face had two black eyes that werent on level with each other. A crooked red smile ran its course almost diagonally; it looked like a drop of blood that followed a crack in the Earth that ran down hill. Its torso was as dark as my insides. The moonlight barely sketched the outline of the entity. If anything, the pale face was just hovering unassisted. Like a painting, the figure never moved.

If it were human, its breath wouldve clouded the window given how close it stood. Air never seemed to push its chests outwards, or pull it back in. The eyes remained black like a spooked horse; if it had blinked, its eyes would cease to be a mirror. No such thing happened. I shuffled to the left so I could bypass all of the furniture. Oddly enough, its eyes never followed me. I was in its peripheral and it did not twist its neck even slightly.

Given Halloween was only about 2 weeks away, this very easily couldve been someone showing off their costume way too early and trying to scare people. Hell, Ive done it. I bolted away from the living room, up the stairs, and into my parents bedroom. I woke them up to tell them that someone was on our porch. 

When the three of us returned, the figure was not there. 

In the following weeks, even on Halloween night, the figure had never returned. Ill never know if it was a person, an apparition, or some otherworldly visitor. All I know is my image reflected on the the eye of the visitor just like it did on the window. I see my image reflected in the window every day. I dont know if Ill ever see my image reflected in its eyes again, but it doesn't matter because it will always haunt my memory.

<TITLE> A Cure for the Itch </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-28 00:26:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Something is tickling my spine, and it has caused the bone to itch.It's the kind of itch that seemingly has no cure; it just travels to another area that's harder to reach. My arms struggle to snake all the way to the center of my back where the most vital organs reside. The knob of bone that divides my arm and shoulder cannot bend backwards any further without cracking it.

The blade of a knife adds a few extra inches to the furthest extent of my arm. It's capable of massaging the itch, but is still no cure. I cannot tell if my mind is just playing trick, teasing each inch of my anatomy.Maybe the itch migrated deeper into my flesh.My arm cannot stretch beyond its limits to use my fingernails to collect scraps of the epidermis and its neighboring layers. Instead, the knife plunges deeper into the flesh than my fingernails ever could.

I've dug deep enough so the point of the knife can scratch the bone with the antagonizing itch. I've scraped at it for a few minutes now and yet the itch proceeds to get worse. It's almost like a family of insects are trying to escape the permanent darkness that is my inner body. They've chewed through what they could and recuperated on the bay of the bone, digesting their meal. Maybe it's a snake slithering about my ribcage as if each rib bone was a tree branch. The knife has made contact with some kind of foreign presence.

I've had enough.

I suspend two ropes from the roof of the house and attach metal hooks to each of them at the ends. I place one hook on one side of my spine, then the other hook on the other side. The hooks securely grip the flesh surrounding my spinal cord. With everything in place, I jump off of the roof until the ropes have stretched as far as they could, pulling the hooks the opposite direction out of my back. Flesh braided with veins dangle from the hooks on the side of the house. A pair of black, jagged wings protrude from my new wounds and take advantage of the wind beneath them.

Flight has taken place.

The itch is cured.

<TITLE> The Silence Was Loud </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-26 16:43:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My bedroom, the adjacent bedroom, and the connecting bathroom were all accounted for. Each light was put to rest and each door was closed. I flirted with a peaceful slumber rather quickly. It felt like I could be unconscious any minute. The darkness orchestrated a peaceful silence.

A womans scream disrupted the silence. It was the kind of scream one would expel if they saw something or were experiencing something particularly frightening. It wasnt my mother  she was out of town that weekend visiting family  and there were no other females in the house. My body shot up, but I refused to leave the comfort of my own bed. 

Suddenly, my bathroom door thundered with a pulse of knocking. At first, it was steady and persistent, continuing for a solid minute or so. As time progressed, the knocking slowed and the volume of the sound decreased. Eventually, the knocking came to a stop. The room was back to its original silence, except there was nothing peaceful about it. I quivered in my bed as I was too scared to bolt out the room. 

The silence was disrupted yet again by what sounded like someone desperately gasping for air. The breathing seemed to belong to the same person who belted out that loud scream just minutes before. Akin to the knocking on the door, the breathing slowed until it came to a halt. The scene became dead silent again. I saw the knob of my bathroom door slowly twist. The door inched open to reveal the bathroom submerged in darkness. If something existed in there, it was staring me down while my eyes struggled to part the darkness.

A beam of light pierced through the darkness from underneath the bathroom door that lead into the adjacent bedroom. The light stretched several feet across the floor, barely illuminating the rest of the room. Directly in front of the door, a pool of maroon was revealed by the light. Falling droplets add to its size. My eyes followed upward to determine the source. The light outlined a pair of feet swaying back and forth. Drops of blood jumped from the toes into the puddle underneath. Like a dying animal finishing its last breath, the toes wiggled briefly before ceasing completely.

An unidentified woman hangs in my bathroom.

Because the light was unable to brighten the entire room, it only revealed up to her knees. The light would not allow me to get acquainted with whoever it was dangling in my bathroom. The body continued to swing gently until it faced the door with the light peaking through the crack. Once she faced the door, her body stopped swinging. After several moments, she started turning again. She did not swing like before, rather it seemed the rope did not assist whatsoever. Her body faced towards me. I was given one last moment of silence and my heart could no longer beat. 

The same scream from before erupts from the dangling woman.
