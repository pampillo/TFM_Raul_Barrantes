If you can pm me your paypal info I'll pay you right away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just to piggy back on this, you can even break it into bundles and stick a price w/ pics.  All x-men, all flash, etc.  I love to buy comics but with 3 kids in 5 total sports, im on the run constantly and im positive there's stuff here id buy but its presented in a manner i just cant sort through easily on mobile.  Maybe id offer you something for the whole lot but i need precise inventory and pics of keys to validate grading.  Just as said above, not being a jerky boy, want to help you sell those sweet sweet comics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are some nice items in there.  If you don't mind, subreddit rules on the right side require that anything you are selling have a price.

*You MUST provide a value you want for your books/goods. We are no longer accepting "make an offer" posts. This creates a blind auction-type and competitive environment and is against the spirit of this subreddit.*

<TEXT> There's a lot of excellent observations on here, especially about driving through town...my kids are all in activities and god forbid that those activities are anywhere near our house.  If I have to drive down O street...just shoot me.

Anyways, my point of posting was that recently it was mentioned in the newspaper that there is (was) only one person in charge of all the lights in Lincoln.  One, single, person.  They are now in the process of hiring more in anticipation of upgrading the traffic system in town over the next few years.  I want to say the article mentioned 30+ but I could be wrong.  This should correct most of the issues we've faced for the last...god forever it seems.  There have been a few articles on it, here are two I could find: 

* [Smarter intersections coming to Lincoln](http://journalstar.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/smarter-intersections-coming-to-lincoln/article_80ae18e5-5e97-57ac-bdb2-dd722f97c177.html)

* [City looking to smarter intersections, not wider streets in future](http://journalstar.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/city-looking-to-smarter-intersections-not-wider-streets-in-future/article_d6e28e89-e082-54aa-a151-47b285ba5be4.html)


I am not sure where we are on the time table but one article I read, which I cannot find now, said it would take a few years.  I've welcomed the introduction of the flashing yellow arrow which allows us a longer turn duration but I've also been behind folks that do not know what to do so they just sit there.  When I honk, I get the finger.  :(
  Anyways...for a long time resident who hates driving through town, I thought you would all enjoy what I hope brings us quicker commutes.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know I am late to the party.  I only wanted to try add to the excellent advice already provided.  At this moment in my life, I am primarily a "buyer" looking for a wide range of comics.   I am also a parent with 3 kids in 8 bajillion activities so I am almost always mobile and on the go.  These recommendations are based on things that have caused me some frustration and to move past a posting.

* 1.)  Clear and concise description of items.  What I mean by that is that simply putting "Spider-man #17" is confusing to me.  I would prefer:  "Amazing Spider-man Vol. 1 #17 (1964)".  This saves me time from having to look at the pic, on mobile, and know which of the dozens of "Spider-man #17" there are.  By the time I understand what is being offered, it may be gone or I've spent 10 minutes to learn it's not an item I care about.

* 2.)  Clear and concise description of condition.  I know most of us are not graders, I am not, but if there is a mark or a crease or a something we should note when looking at the provided pics, that is great.  If you were to say, there is an indent by the top staple, then I can pay close attention and see if its of concern for me.  If its a $1 comic, who cares, but if its a $150...please share.

* 3.)  Pictures; clear and provided at the time of posting.  A few times I've seen posts something like this:  "here are my comics...I'll post pics in a day or two b/c I am busy".     Why did you post then??  We are going to ask for pics anyway just wait and do it at once.  Those posts will usually fall back a page and I will forget about them unless its a super key issue.  Or if the pic is blurry, upside down, in a dark room on someones colorful bedsheet...blarg.  Good pics, clear and easy to see please.

* 4.)  Price reasonably.  I track prices on a lot of items or I will check on a few other sites.  Folks on here are savvy and do the same.  I would rather pay a little more for the security of Ebay or the google groups I am on then on Reddit.  With that said, I've spent around $700 on comics here.  I've gotten several of the keys I've wanted and its always been a very positive experience.  Folks on here rock!  :)

Looking forward to what you have to offer.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Certainly as a parent, if you feel this crossed a boundary then feel free to discuss it with your teacher and tell your child its ok to say no.

However, as you are asking for feedback, I think this is perfectly fine and normal.  Outside of a few exceptions, teachers are amazing and only care for the well being our children.  Perhaps she was worried your child would choke on it or maybe this was preventing them for eating lunch.  Would you want the teacher to let these things happen?   I would ask myself, what would I have the teacher do instead.  If you feel there are better options for your family, that is what you share with the teacher.

Teachers do all sorts of things, wipe poopy butts (it happens in kindergarten), wipe runny, snotty noses, scoop up puke and so on.  I would want the teacher to do what is, in their judgement, the best for our child in any of those situations.

If they gave a child a hair cut, I would think that is crazy.  Removing a dangling tooth, its happened to all of our children at least once. They even get a special little tooth shaped case to bring it home in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Came here to say the same.  Toys and games have pointed to DarkHawk being in GotG and comic speculators have started to snatch up the available copies of DarkHawk #1 in response.  Whether or not Stallone is this character...I am not sure, I am not very familiar with him.  Reading through Wikipedia, I can see where it could work, specially if there is a Richard Ryder - Nova.  It's at least worth adding this to the conversation.

EDIT

and now this morning I see that James Gunn said no DarkHawk.."and Adam Warlock  will not appear in GotGVol2". NOOO! </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP here...I hope no one minds me posting this story, even if its a little old.  When I was home visiting my folks for christmas, they gave my son a copy of the local paper with this story knowing how much he would enjoy it.  
 nbsp;

  A quick backstory...about a year ago, we had to move my Grandmother from IL to an assisted living facility near my folks in Nebraska.  She is struggling with Dementia but she is in a safe environment, well cared for and my mother gets to visit her everyday.  
 nbsp;

  Of course, our entire family are all huge Cub fans (Ages 6 - 98) and whenever any of us visit my grandmother we are always wearing something with that big beautiful Cubs logo on it.  
 nbsp;

  Anyways, we were there in the spring and a resident stopped my son (must have noticed his Cubs hat) and said, "Hey, my neighbor used to play for the Cubs, you should go by and visit him sometime"...he then walked on down the hall.  
 nbsp;

  Now remember, we are in an assisted living facility for folks with Dementia and just didn't know what to think.  They are all wonderful folks and we love to visit with them but figured this person may just be confused and simply proceeded with our day.  However, over the last year, my son would bring it up on occasion and we'd wonder if there was a long lost Cub player just down the hall from my Grandmother, a huge Cubs fan.  Apparently there is.  
 nbsp;

  My son and I will see if we can visit with him next time we are in town and take my Grandmother over there to meet him.  She'll be tickled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm definitely interested in New Mutants #1 @ $18 and possibly Marvel Premiere #47.  I typically just paypal b/c I'm a hoarder (lol) but I did just acquire a few items you might want.  Not suggesting a straight up trade but thought I'd see where we can end up at.


* Power Man   Iron Fist #125 (nm).
* MARVEL TEAM-UP ANNUAL #4 (nm).
* Defenders #18 (vf - think it could be pressed for a bump in grade, maybe).

I can get some pics later this afternoon if you think you might want those.    The two you have $18 + $60 = $78.  With my trades, how about $60 with shipping included?  I'd ship mine to you at my cost of course.

If you think you'd be interested, let me know.  Thanks!

<TEXT> It's one of the hottest comics right now, if not the #1 sought after and totally a sellers market.  I've been watching it in a few places and I think the price is a little inflated and can vary wildly from site to site.  The prices I am seeing folks pay for this comic are really surprising ($300 for a raw NM??).  It may calm down a bit until the movie comes out but for the same or less money, there may be a better comic to invest in that we know will continue to gain value.  I'll be interested to hear other peoples take or recommendation.  Like I said, I'm watching too and hopefully I'll find one in the wild for a fair price.  

I was going to try and pick up issue #10 but I just watched the prices jump up on that literally overnight.  Had it in my cart, got busy, came back this morning, tears.

Good luck and happy hunting </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just providing some details for others that may be interested.  I only posted this in case I was missing something that may make another deal more worth while.  You were quite certain the other place was cheaper so I thought I'd see if maybe I was overlooking something obvious.

I also don't see where you said shipping was free in your original post:

Still not as good a deal as ordering off instocktrades (if you're in the U.S.).... (is Barnes and Noble international?).

  If that's the case, that's good to know for future reference.

-edit.  You had asked if it was price from third party seller.  I am not sure, it doesn't indicate that it is.  Here is how it appears in my cart: http://imgur.com/jIxCbfq </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, maybe I'm missing something, but if I want to get the 3 GL Omnibus, BN has the best deal:

**BN:**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 1* - **79.08**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 2* - **64.46** *(Free b/c of promo)*

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 3* - **81.25**

**Total = 160.33 + $11.22 tax = $171.55** *plus free shipping for orders over $25.*

**InStockTrades.com:**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 1* - **68.75**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 2* - **54.99**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 3* - **68.75**

**Total = 192.49**  *(not sure on shipping)*

**Amazon:**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 1* - **78.12**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 2* - **63.20**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 3* - **67.54**

**Total = 208.86** *plus free 2 day shipping (prime member)*

  In my case, the B N deal is by far the better one.  $20.94 cheaper than the site you mentioned and even more if they charge for shipping.  Ultimately shop around and make sure you are getting the best deal no matter when you make your purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My daughter is 6 and plays t-ball on an all boys team.  I am always proud that she pays pretty close attention but its not uncommon for her to look at the clouds or draw something in the dirt, or any kid for that matter.  When she was at bat in her last game, the catcher from the other team kept saying, "I'm a Dog!" and rolling around in the dirt in full catcher gear.  She looked up at me with the "you got to be kidding me" face.

  There are usually 3 kids playing the in the dirt, one throwing their hat in the air, another crying for some reason and one chasing a butterfly.  It's sort of a giant cute parade of chaos.  You can only laugh and enjoy it.  Again, these kids are six and going into first grade.  Your child is only four and totally 100% normal and to be expected.  I bet if you look close, the other kids are no different.  There are kids in my sons games (he's nearly 13) that occasionally loses focus...hell even pros do.

  The most important thing, they make friends and have fun.  As they get older, that will evolve into a love of the game and desire to get better.  Or not, and that's totally ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's been a number of articles lately that mention him.  Here is one from the 10th.

[April 10th LJS](http://journalstar.com/sports/huskers/football/red-report-armstrong-says-teammates-were-his-backbone-after-iowa/article_f51af83c-1dce-5556-8ff1-26df31ef21a4.html):

The return to full strength won't be as quick for De'Mornay Pierson-El (fractured left leg), but Williams is encouraged on that front, too.

He expects Pierson-El to be back in the summer. "It won't be, like, August," the coach said. "It's how hard you would think it would be, it's tough. But you just keep on working. He's not going to feel good about it. But he understands it's a process. And in situations like that, you get small victories from feeling a little stronger every day."

  There was also one recently that said he should take a redshirt and sit the year:

[Athlon Sports Article](http://athlonsports.com/college-football/nebraskas-demornay-pierson-els-best-option-different-red-shirt-2016#sthash.n6Es4CNh.gbpl st_refDomain=www.facebook.com st_refQuery=/)

  If you search the LJS or OWH site for "De'Mornay Pierson-El" there are a few others articles.  Hopefully this gets you what you were looking/hoping for.  :) </TEXT>

As I am originally from Illinois, it was pretty funny (to me) that it was the Illinoise album that I first came across and got me hooked.  When I heard a few tracks I said, why am I only just discovering this now!?  I only have Illinoise on vinyl (gift from my thoughtful wife probably so I'd stop playing it in the car all the time) but I want to get the others as well.  Thanks for sharing more details on the albums and more back story on him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would suggest, perhaps, that you approach this in another way.  Instead of "forcing" you could instead encourage folks to volunteer.  For example, one of my former employers would donate $150 to a charity of my choice if I volunteered at least 10 hours per quarter.  This had to be tracked but it did encourage me to find ways to volunteer when I otherwise may not have.  I also then got to donate $600 a year to a local charity so it was a definitely a win-win.

Also, one of my former clients, a children's dental office, took a totally different approach.  Each year, they close their office for a week and spend that time in a village in Central or South America, doing free dental work for children.  The doctor would take care of all the expenses and paid the staff as she normally would, but they got to spend a week "volunteering" so to speak.  It was not only a wonderful, charitable act, but it was a great way for the staff to bond.

There is a whole volunteering subreddit that could offer other suggestions as well, I imagine.  Best of luck to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Will get buried but my very first job was when I was 14.  It is common for kids in the midwest to get jobs [detassling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detasseling).  I am the oldest kid in the family and was very naive.  My parents dropped me off where the bus was to pick us up.  I had a small cooler with my lunch and water.  Im standing there, all doey eyed, not sure what to expect.  Then here comes this jacked up blue ford pickup, tearing through the parking lot.  The truck roars to a stop, then backs up...into a light pole.  The door rips open and out pops the most fouled mouth woman I've ever met to this day.  *WHAT THE FUCK! GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKER!*  She then looks over at us like fresh meat.  She is what they call, a straw boss.  Someone who has done this for a number of years and is deemed worthy of having a leadership role.  *ANY OF YOU LITTLE FUCKERS FUCK WITH ME TODAY AND I'LL FIRE YOUR ASSES!*  So yeah, I was fucking scared.  I thought this was a job for kids, not the Marines.  

Anyways, they shuffle us onto an old yellow school bus and haul us out to a corn field where we were trained by this same lovely screaming mess pull these tassels out of the top of corn stalks.  I just didn't get it at first, which frustrated the foul mouthed beast, so she fired me.  I was there maybe two hours, fired.  I was told to go sit on the bus.  I made the long trip back where I met several other young-lings who also pissed her off one way or the other.  All fired.  I climb into the bus (boiling mid-July temperature mind you) to then find that my cooler (lunch, water, snack) had been raided by the other straw bosses.  All my food and water gone.  The same with most of the kids.  As I sat there the rest of the day, sweating my ass off, no food or drink, I watched as more and more kids made their way back.  She fired 11 kids in total that day.  I heard later she fired 8 more the next day and was then terminated herself.  

It worked out for the best.  I got a job a few days later walking beans (pulling weeds in bean fields) for a local farmer.  I got paid a bit more, the work was less grueling and the farmers wife made the best home cooked lunches for us.  I'll never forget how kind and nice they were. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm trying to be ambigious for a reason so I apologize for some generalizations.  My wife is friends with a teacher here in Lincoln.  She said that the Superintendent had visited their school recently and school expansion was discussed to some extent.  Specifically, due to the population boom on the NW side of town, Arnold is already over capacity (just opened 7 years ago) and they considering a number of approaches to address the boom including building an additional grade school out there.  They could be considering doing what some schools in larger cities have done, where that they split grade school into two halves, k-2 in one school and then 3-5 in another.  Maybe this is what mr guitarist means, i.e., they are considering some different ways to address the student population growth but nothing has been officially proposed, so to speak.  I certainly could have heard wrong but that's the word through the grape vine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw this comment and just wanted to take a moment and say thank you.  I've never seen or read your comic but there are countless "comic families" (as I like to call us) that need/want more of these types of titles.  My wife and I take our three kids to "cons" and we spend most of our time talking to independent writers/artists, especially those produce great works that we can share with our kids.  It is a family hobby and we actively seek out new books to read with our kids.

Second, thank you for doing something you enjoy and are passionate about.  That is sometimes hard to do so great job!  

I've liked your facebook page, hope to hear more about your work and maybe we will see you at a show down the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can appreciate the frustration.  Our youngest of 3 is five years old and these sort of battles will come up from time to time.  All grandparents are different and typically there is a change in parenting styles between your first child and your second or third, for example.  At least there was for my wife and I and many of our friends.  And the grandparents are at that point already plus, they forget the trouble and mayhem it can cause when they don't adhere to reasonable guidelines for food, bedtime and so forth.  It's the ole, we did "X" when we were parents and you survived.  Uggg, I hate that saying.  Anyways, the bottom line is they get to have all the fun and then you have to deal with the fallout.

I quite literally have the best father-in-law one could ever dream of.  He is amazing.  However, when our oldest, my son, was going to spend the weekend with him a few years ago, we warned and begged him not to fill him with fast food and ice cream.  My son has to have a well balanced diet or he will get sick and constipated.  He thought we were being a little over dramatic and didn't heed our warnings.  After a day which included three fast food visits and candy from a parade, he ended up with a kid who had a stomach ache all night long and through the entire next day.  It ruined their fun weekend and he felt terrible about it.  I guess he had to go through all of that before he remembered that parents sometimes know best.

Grandparents get wrapped up in creating moments and memories and they forget how hard it is at times when they don't have to deal with the after effects.  All you can do is be honest and say, I know you want to stay up late and have fun, but it will take me two weeks to get them back on schedule and that one night of fun will create two weeks of agony for me.  I'd appreciate if you can help me out by doing x, y and z.  Or, I know its fun to give them sweets but I've already been struggling to get them to eat their normal food, now it could be even harder.  If you can help me on this, I would appreciate it!

At the end of the day.  They are the grandparents and you want them to create those great memories but there's no harm in explaining why you don't want to do certain things.  I have even had to tell my Dad, I'm sorry you disagree with me on this but if my doctor says we should do this, I think I am going to side with her this one time (eye roll).

Just don't be over dramatic b/c they won't hear the message.  Just be honest and fair and things will probably work out fine.  If they don't...well...welcome to parenthood where everyone else knows better than you... :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great question.  Although I read some comics as a kid, I just couldn't afford them so now, as an adult, I am finally able to enjoy them.  It is pretty overwhelming to walk into a comic store and know where to start, and I even have this very question about Vision on my list.  What I have been doing is going to my local comic book store and saying, I am interested in such and such, where is a good place to start or what are some great reads with that character.  They usually give me a handful of recommendations and then I work my way through the list.  My wife and kids have even gotten into it too.  She spends more now than I ever have.

BTW, thanks to everyone who have made suggestions here, I will check them out as well.  You all rock! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree.  One of my favorite moments from the Justice League Unlimited series is when Superman fights Dark Seid and he talks about how he can finally let loose.

Superman:  "That man (Batman) won't quit as long as he can still draw a breath. None of my teammates will. Me? I've got a different problem. I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard. Always taking constant care not to break something. To break someone. Never allowing myself to lose control, even for a moment, or someone could die."
[Darkseid tries to attack, but Superman knocks him back]
Superman: "But you can take it, can't ya, big man? What we have here is a rare opportunity for me to cut loose, and show you just how powerful I really am!"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwU0QkcrNVQ

I think they missed a really interesting opportunity.  At the end of the day, and I am probably in the minority, but I wish they would have gone along those lines with the character.  There are a million ways to tell a story and this is their way, what ya gonna do?  shrug </TEXT>

<TEXT> They did something along these lines with their DC Showcase animated films.  It had Jonah Hex, The Spectre, Green Arrow, etc.  I loved them and thought they should stick a live action one in front of any future films.  Sort of like how Pixar/Disney does it, where you will typically see a short animated movie before the main attraction.  

I'd like to see them focus on characters you'd never likely see in a regular film.  I think it would be an amazing opportunity. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I'd probably have to say it was when I saw "Brad" at the Ranch Bowl in Omaha back in the late 90s.  I had been a huge fan for years and was incredibly excited to see them.  I had no idea what to expect.
  Myself and 4 other friends drove up there from Lincoln.  When we got to the show, we were shocked to only find about 5 other people there.  Funny thing was, they were there from Minneapolis (I think) to see the opening band and never heard of Brad before.  :)

  Just before Brad played, my buddy and I waited outside their bus and when Stone stepped out, we visited with him briefly, thanking him for all the years of great music.  He signed some green river and mother love bone stuff for my friend before dashing in for the show.  

  He and his band mates then treated us to probably the best show I've ever seen.  Since there were literally 5 of us there to see one of my favorite bands, it was like it was our own personal show.  One of my favorite moments was when the rest of the band took a smoke break, Shawn Smith played Benny and the Jets.  It was surreal.

  After the show, we drove down the street to Perkins for some food and to take a moment for it all to soak in.  We were dumbstruck with the experience we just had.  

  While waiting for our food we look up and here comes their tour bus...parking right outside.  Then, in strolls Stone Gossard and Shawn Smith and place some orders to go.  My friend and I got up the courage to go over and visit with them.

 We then sat and talked with them in the lobby of Perkins for about 15 minutes about god knows what b/c we were so star struck.  It was an incredible night and I'm so thankful I got the opportunity to say thanks to one of my favorite musicians and that I got to share that with some very close friends. </TEXT>

Looking on Huskermax, people seem pretty excited but I guess if we have fans that are already throwing in the towel, then that's pretty shitty.

Another kid chose Rutgers and you took that as a strike against Riley.  He was from New Jersey.

I just said I think he did a great job given the circumstances, provided data to substantiate that and said I think he will be a successful recruiter based on history and other coaches opinion.

You are welcome to your opinion obviously but if you are going to toss it on Reddit, you should expect it to be scrutinized. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wisconsin, although they went through a change too, hired a coach who was there before as a coordinator.  They had a handful of decommits and last I looked, were behind us in ranking.

I'm sure there is a site that has coach change/recruiting rank listed but I dont have the time to find or make one.  I do know we are one of the top ranked classes who have gone through this change.  

Mike Reilly was considered, by PAC 12 coaches, to be far and above the best evaluater of talent in that conference.  He is going to be successful but we can't blow a gasket when a teenager changes his mind.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has got to be one of the dumbest things I've ever read.  

Sykes misled everyone, including his HS coach who was handling his recruiting, what more do you want Riley to do when a kid says he's coming and even yesterday afternoon said he was all N.  Ask him to pinky swear?

And who chooses Rutgers over Nebraska?  How about a kid from New Jersey who said, now my family can watch me play every weekend.  Jesus H Christ.  

Riley beat Harbaugh on 2 out of 3.  The two that decommited before Sykes were already rumored to be on the fence before Pelini even left.  Hell Bussey just flipped AGAIN.  

Typically when there is a coach change, there is a hellava lot more turmoil.  He's kept the class intact, brought in some real gems and is doing better than a vast majority of the schools that had a coaching change.  Michigan, who most people feel had one of the best hires, is currently sitting at 55th in the recruiting rankings per 247.  We are at 30th, based on average star ranking [LINK](http://247sports.com/Season/2015-Football/CompositeTeamRankings).  Rivals has us at 33 and Michigan at 67 [LINK](http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/teamrank/2015/all/all).  Those numbers could change, but I think he did an amazing job given the situation.  

Plus he is already working on the next two classes.  He offered a kid for the 2017 class.  He is even going to have someone on staff that is dedicated to recruiting walk-ons.  I think he is going to surprise a lot of folks.  And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  I'm certainly not going to throw a public temper tantrum.

<TEXT> that is a bit of an outrageous statement.  I paid for a game that had a specified release timeline and nothing has been delivered.  The former community manager got admin rights to this subreddit then started banning people who asked legit questions which in turn made a lot of folks around here (like me) very angry and frustrated.

I gave Sauropod Studio money on July 29th, 2012 for a game for which the beta was to be delivered several months later.   This is now 2015 and I'd hardly call what we have today an alpha.  It's at best a tech demo.  So yeah, I am a bit peeved but look, like I've said a 1000000000 times on here and even to the Devs, we all make mistakes.  What has pissed me off is how they have handled every single one of those.  They treat the community poorly unless you kiss ass, the LACK of any substantial info/updates and the general 'meh' attitude.  I don't give two shits if they don't like it.  I am not a mindless ass-kisser.  I want to know what the fuck they are doing.  They said "we will give you a product if you give us money".  I held up my end of the bargain nearly 31 months ago.  And you can't call a flurry of "updates" through the month of December (to increase the total # of updates) anything resembling communication, but its certainly a start.

  You can feel free to defend these folks to the end of time, but dont you dare call me a baby b/c I paid for something and I'm asking for them to actually produce it.  Do you want to send me some money?  I'll give you what they gave me, a big turd of nothing but I won't waste 31 months producing it.  Next day delivery guaranteed, just give me 15 minutes to get it into a box.

  If their Kick Starter ad said, "Hey, we are Sauropod Studios...um we don't know a frigging thing about game development and will treat you like shit once we have your money" then I wouldn't have invested.  Instead, it looked promising and I'd much rather give money to a small dev to make a great little game then to buy BattleField 7, expansion pack 14.  Every other game I've backed has had delays, but they've always communicated, apologized and explained, but in the mean time we've had something to play.  They treated us right, like the investors we are, and understood the importance of a strong community behind you.

  I hope these chaps turn things around but this once a month "reddit shamming" by some Sauropod Studio white knight is getting old.  We have a right to be frustrated.

<TEXT> That's interesting as when they were released it did not support this.  When I read this comment I thought it, well my tv has does support HDMI 1.4 (I believe off the top of my head) and so I started digging, I am unable to find anything on the Google site that says it is supported and an article from Anantech, back when this product was released, clearly states it does not.

*In fact, the Chromecasts form factor is already a popular one for Android-powered HDMI dongles and Miracast sinks, as well as a variety of other small appliances. Ive confirmed with Google that MHL-HDMI is not in fact supported by the Chromecast, meaning it cant be powered by a TV that includes the spec (which can deliver up to 500 mA at 5 V),*

[LINK](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7186/google-chromecast-review-an-awesome-35-hdmi-dongle)

  [This](https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/3212934?hl=en ref_topic=3058948) Chromecast "setup" page doesn't mention it either.

  Please dont take this as me saying you are wrong, more...is there a new revision or can you point me to something that say it works.  I could just be wrong about my TV, just havent given it much thought as I just plug it into the USB port.  Just interested in reading more about it but maybe my Google-fu sucks balls today.

-edited to add some info I found but then found another post that debunked it so I removed it.  I'll wait to hear a response from someone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's what comes to mind most for me actually.  My grandfather passed away 3 years ago.  He was a great man and loved the Cubs.  At 96 years of age, he never lived during a time when the Cubs had won a world series.  When I spoke at his funeral I said my son and I would be there to see them win and we'd carry pictures of him so he won't miss out.

My grandmother will be 94 next year, her older sister 97 and her younger sister 92.  They are all Cub fans as well, I hope we can get a win for them before its too late.

We aren't there yet but it's always good to have something new to talk about back home.  :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> By comparison, when Tom Osborne was AD and had to fire our BB coach, Doc Sadler, they held a joint press conference and he got to discuss it and sort of say goodbye, which was nice.

http://vimeo.com/38254819

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYoJHmuy2hM

I am not saying that they could have done that with Bo but I think that was a classy way to handle a tough situation.  Doc was a great man, kind and admirable coach who just couldn't get the program where they felt it should be.  

I think in dealing with Bo, it could have and should have been handled much better.  I hope I get a chance to run into him here in town before he moves on so I can at least tell him thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was specifically referencing how to disable THP from that URL so I apologize if there is some confusion and you felt I meant the first paragraph. And again, I am not suggesting disabling THP will positively work, simply that I am aware that it has been known to cause issues similar to what has been described.  

I work for a software company and THP (transparent huge pages) causes issues with our application and it does with others as well.  Here is an article from Oracle:  https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/entry/performance_issues_with_transparent_huge .  The behavior is similar to a memory leak and over time the system becomes unresponsive.  Once disabled, the system acts normally.

I was merely offering a suggestion and disabling won't hurt anything, if it is something they wanted to test. </TEXT>

I would consider looking at disabling THP and reviewing ulimits settings.  I've seen THP in some scenarios cause memory leak like issues.  Here is an article on that:  http://blog.couchbase.com/often-overlooked-linux-os-tweaks .

Here is increasing open file limits for ulimit: (for Ubuntu but should be the same for Fedora):  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21515463/how-to-increase-maximum-file-open-limit-ulimit-in-ubuntu .

But lose the game, repeatedly post shit calling the other team cheaters, right?*
    
What does that have to do with what I said???  Did I SAY ANY OF THOSE THINGS??  Please help me understand.  I said both sides are over-reacting.  You sir are over-reacting.  You are calling people dumbasses.  Of all the people on this thread to attack, you picked me.  
    
So you know what, you win.  Enjoy your season. </TEXT>

<TEXT> so let me try and get this straight...b/c I am a dumbass as you mentioned, I want to be sure that I totally understand what your point is.  
   
I simply point out that both sides, that means both Nebraska and MSU, are making too much of this, specifically over-reacting and I mention that this thread seemed like overkill.  You then are kind enough to come in and prove my point by not only over-reacting, but then by calling me names.  
    
If you check my post history you will see that I have said that this is a non-issue and that we were taken to the woodshed by MSU.  I am on your side.  Our team looked like ass and MSU won fair and square.  I am not sure what I did to cause such a stink with you but I hope you realize you have become the worst kind of sports fan.  You are a terrible representation of a true MSU fan.
    
Now, lets hope this can be put to rest.  Or do you have some more thoughtful words to share? </TEXT>

<TEXT> its getting blown out of proportion by both sides.  It was directly asked of Bo and he didn't really say much other than he wanted it reviewed by the Big 10 officials.  The fans on both sides are really making too much of it.  The coach didn't whine or use it as an excuse.  It was a fair ask but for some reason we have to go on and on about it.  The thread yesterday should have been enough and I hope we dont have to hear about it again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I wish they would change to a leg kick or something else, I've been saying that for a long time.  If it was me (on the defense) and I was doing it intentionally then I'd save it for what could be key plays however after seeing more info and reading the interpretation of the rules from the big 10 officials, it seems to be allowed.  Obviously I am not on the team so I can't say why they wouldn't have adjusted.  My assumptions is they didn't realize there was an issue until they talked when watching film.  Like.."hey dumbass, why'd you hike the ball there"....and he was like, " DUDE, I heard you clap".  
    
I only played up to High School FB but I just dont recall seeing claps used for signals but I guess I stand corrected. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just don't know what to think.  I want a good solid game, both ways.  No questionable calls I have to hear about for 20 years.  It really feels like we could win by 21 or lose by 21.  
    
We have a very solid running game and our QB, Armstrong, can make some big time plays as well.  [HERE](https://gfycat.com/IncomparableShorttermHorseshoecrab) is a 4th and 22 last week where he went 25.  He is also excellent at the long ball, his short passes need a lot of work.  In the end, he could be a pretty special player.
    
Our defense isn't quite "there" yet.  We lost 3 expected starters before the season started and a few more have been dinged up.  They usually take a quarter to adjust and then play pretty solid ball.  The problem is we can't give away points to Michigan State b/c they don't make mistakes and we have to make them earn it all or we'll be chasing them all night.
    
Ultimately it will probably be a shoot out that will cause me to drink uncontrollably. </TEXT>

<TEXT> we won't really know how good we are until next week.  I just see too many question marks myself and I have rose tinted glasses.  If we can clean up somethings, improve how we start games defensively we have a good chance to win out.  That's a lot of ifs...but if any of our recent teams can do that, its this one.  Our depth on D is getting pretty thin though..agh, I'll need to stock up on some extra booze for the game.
    
On the flip side, I don't really think there is a true dominant OMG team this year.  It's fairly exciting season b/c I really think just about anyone can win in the right situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've wanted to state something similar the past few weeks.  I really feel for the Michigan fans.  We went through all this same shit.  We had a TERRIBLE AD (he who shall remain nameless) that fired a popular and well liked coach after a 9 win season, struggled to find a good replacement and went with a shitty NFL coach who dismantled our program and left it in ruin.  We are still seeing the effects of that "era" to this day.

I hope that things turn around for you fast and I know that although our teams will battle (on occasion) for the foreseeable future, I have immense respect for your school, your fans and your tradition.  I want you to return to your glory days so we can take pleasure in a good, well fought game by two well coached, formidable teams. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a fourth generation Cub fan.  It's all I've ever known.  I spent my summers watching Harry and Steve and even had a whole baseball card album devoted to Jody Davis.

My son was born in Oct 2003.  We all know what happened that fall.  Although disappointing, it is one of our favorite memories from our marriage, strange as it may seem.  Our child gestating while we scream and cheer for the Cubbies.

My son will soon be 11 and has been playing baseball for 6 years now.  This was the first year he really "got it" and started to love it.  We could sit together and cheer on the Cubs and watch these young men grow and develop.  We went to a AAA game and he got autographs from Bryant and Baez.  We went to a Cubs game and he got many more autographs, one of those being Russel's, just a few hours before he was traded.

This was my favorite year because I had my son to share it with.  I hope he has as much fun watching them succeed in the coming years as I had watching them come close.  Hello 5th generation Cubs fan! </TEXT>

We all went downtown afterwards and the streets were jammed packed, shoulder to shoulder, and everyone was going crazy.  It was a helleva way to kick off collegiate life.  In retrospect, I didn't realize the gravity of the thing at that point but I was glad I got to see it happen.

It was also exciting b/c Cory Schlesinger had gone to my high school and was obviously well known in our area. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is simply this, their PR/Community Manager/Whateverheiscalled can't take the slightest amount of criticism and has become an excuse machine.  I am as frustrated as the next person that we were essentially lied to during the Kickstarter campaign and instead of handling it correctly, that bozo became a mod for this subreddit and started banning people.  I wont rehash all of that, but that become a tipping point for me.  I went from slightly annoyed, never posting on this /r/ to angry and disappointed.  
    
People f-up, I f-up, its the way life is.  They f'd-up bad with this kickstarter.  There are always going to be critics, even of the most dedicated and honest among us.  But if you mess up, you own up to it, say your sorry and you then dedicate your energy to making it right.  Instead, they just continued to do the same crap, creating more problems and pissing off more people.  Personally I feel they lack any sort of ethics, integrity or common sense.  
    
If they are a great, organized, efficient, well managed company, then the community manager should be fired because he reflects something which is the complete opposite.
    
If the community manager was really good at his job he would have a found a way to make things right, to make folks, like myself, happy.  It's called, Making Lemonade.  You take a problem and turn it into something good.  "Hey, we really pooched this release bad.  Please forgive us.  To make up for it, here is a free copy of the game to give to a friend"...whatever, say your sorry a hundred times and give us a reason to cheer you on again!
    
I hope at the end of the day they produce a great solid product but they've done exactly ZERO to prove to me that this will happen.  At the end of the day, I'll never buy a product that any of those folks will ever produce again.  That is how much the community manager has angered me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry to hear of your loss and the passing of a great Cub fan.  2 1/2 years ago my grandfather passed away at 96, never having seen the Cubs win a world series.  Just let that sink in...  

  We were able to memorialize his and my grandmothers love of the team a few years before his passing by purchasing them an engraved brick that is now part of the paving outside of Wrigley.  We all spoke at his funeral in great depth of his love of the Cubs and I promised him that I would be carrying a picture of him when my son and I watched the Cubs finally win the series.  I then emphasized, "when...not if"!

May you pass on the same love and passion for our team as she has passed onto you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shortly after I backed this game on Kickstarter (July 29th, 2012) , one of the updates, [Kickstarter diary number four : Credit Island](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/902505202/castle-story/posts/291052) dated August 18th, 2012, mentions Credit Island.  [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K0DDysCC4Y) is the YouTube video posted on that update which goes into more detail.  I don't recall seeing anything further mentioned about that (but I could have missed it).  I was wondering if this was still planned to be included in the game as originally promoted? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was at the Iowa Cubs game tonight, just walked in the door with 3 sleepy kids.  My son got Bryant's and Baez's autograph.  We sat in the 2nd row right by the on deck circle and 10 seats or so from the dug out, so we got a close look at these guys we've read so much about.  

Tonight, the Cubs pitching was really shaky, starter Pimentel wasn't very good, he had some great help defensively to keep things from getting really out of hand.  I believe it was Kalsih that nearly climbed the center field wall to stop an easy double.  Vizcaino came in to relieve with a 14 something ERA and left at over 16. 

 I can see the concerns with Bryant's defense.  He fielded 4 challenging hits very well, unfortunately the first two were followed by bad throws to first, one way over Watkins head.  The last 2 were excellent and on the mark.  Of course his home run was amazing, it left the park, disappeared into the night.  Glad I have it on video.  

Baez looked sharp, at the plate and in the field.  Vitters and Jackson still the same...struggling at the plate...saw Wada standing in the dug out as well as Manny.  I'll post some pics tomorrow perhaps.  These guys were no more than 8 feet away from me, it was pretty cool.  

====
EDIT
====

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/jMl9F) is an album of some of the pics, mostly of Baez and Bryant.  I also tried and successfully made a terrible GIF of the Bryant home run.  Sadly the video isn't any better but it was a sight to behold.

<TEXT> this may seem like "no big deal" and certainly I can appreciate the frustration.  One thing to consider is who has to deal with that ultimately.  Having worked for a business downtown, public urination is a huge pain in the ass.  In my case, basically bar folks would wonder off the main drag into the alley and piss on the door/wall behind the business.  Not only did we have big puddles waiting for us in the morning, many times they would piss on the door handle, or in the door seams, I assume, trying to get piss inside.  Any time we had to walk in/our of the back door, we had to walk through and smell piss.  On top of that, it could at times make the back area of the business smell like a urinal.

So some of us, including the owner, had to take time out of our day, quite often, to hose off the back wall, door, etc.  It just really sucked and not something most will consider when squatting in the alley.  It got to the point that my boss installed cameras and started turning them all into the police.  These weren't homeless dudes, they were the college kids who, like me at the time, didn't consider the bigger picture.  We then would get the pleasure of watching them come down and clean up the mess they left.

So while I get there are "bigger fish to fry", if you ever own a business and some asshole pisses on your door every night or you have to take time out of your IT job to hose piss off the back door, you will go...ahhhh...I was being a douchebag. </TEXT>

I was speaking to some of the staff and they were telling me that you will regularly find older fans standing, watching the video and crying.  Not once in a while, nearly every day.  I thought that was very interesting but also a little strange.  It was a cool place to visit nonetheless.  :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> a thousand times this.  I bought a "lifetime license" back in 2009.  The article linked above does a good job of describing what happened shortly thereafter.  I simply won't give them another cent in the future.  I felt they were dishonest and underhanded.  I don't mind paying for a product, I just wasn't provide what I was told I was paying for...on top of that they disabled features that I had access to at the beginning. </TEXT>

Nothing has changed on my system or connection.  I thought this was a fairly well known issue at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used Kaseya for two years while working for a local IT company supporting small and medium sized businesses.  That was 5 years ago so things may have changed and I may have forgotten 90% of the features we used.


Personally, I loved it.  I believe at the time we were supporting approx 40 accounts with around 700 total users.  The product provided a centralized way to manage all of our client workstations and servers.  Remote access, vast assortment of alerting/monitoring that worked with our ticketing system, install/uninstall applications, windows update, wake on lan, etc.  If it didn't do something out the box, we would write scripts and execute them per a schedule or you could find something on their forums that was provided by other admins.  Kaseya also had a very good backup product and it also had integrated AVG what we used for some accounts.


Obviously, a very high level generic response but I do miss having it at my disposal and my experience was very positive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are good fans and bad fans and I have no doubt there were some assholes on our end that deserved some ribbing but I know of a 10 year old and a 14 year old that went with their family to the game and got beer dumped on them, spit on and cursed at.  If you feel that all those excuses you listed above made this justifiable then we have a different meaning of friendly rivalry.  

You wanted our opinion and I shared experiences that were related to me.  If you came into Lincoln and acted like a punk, I'd still be nice and treat you kindly, I guess I'm a bit different then some.  Best of luck in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had several, completely unrelated, groups of friends go to the football game in Madison.  Based upon their experiences, which is summed up pretty well by F.L.A.D. on here, I'd never go to a game in Madison...which should be of great concern to you, your fans and your school.  

I'm from VERY northern Illinois so I feel a connection to Wisconsin, spent a lot of time as a kid fishing up there, vacations, etc.  It's a beautiful state that I love traveling through.  However, I have been less than thrilled with the treatment that our fans received.  It wasn't one guy yelling, F-OFF, which will happen, it was an endless parade of assholes which is unfortunate.  Pretty miserable experience, basically chased out of town is how one friend described it.

Joining the Big 10, I was more concerned with visiting Columbus but I've heard nothing but good things and if the chance presents itself, that is an away destination I would choose.  Definitely not Madison which is unfortunate in my opinion.

I guess living in Lincoln for the last 20 years, I find we go out of our way to make a visiting fan feel welcome and comfortable.  I often purchase returned visiting team tickets (football) and have an awesome time with the visiting fans.  I want you to come back to Lincoln, I want you to be a rival but not an enemy.  I know it probably seems silly from the outside but I take pride in stopping and welcoming a fan to my city, buying them a beer, welcoming them to a tailgate.  I love Lincoln, its a great place.  

But that is all football, the vibe from basketball seems a little more friendly overall in the B1G...but in the end, ignore internet trolls.  Its one thing for a fan to call you names online, its another for fans to throw beer on you while you try and escape to your car after a game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure what all will be needed but I will give a quick run down of things I have done or have experience with.  I'm happy to help in any capacity, be it streaming, video editing, graphics, website/forum/tech help or PR.

* In the olden days, I was an early member of an indie game company (2001-2003).  I was a level designer but also did a lot of community management type stuff.  Moderated forums, did the posts to our website and sent out news items to various gaming news sites, etc.  Public relations type work.

* Also in those olden days, I wrote for a now defunct gaming news site and did a lot of the graphics, reviews, interviews, articles, etc.

*  I have experience with graphic editing and design.  I also originally wanted to work in TV/Film so I do have a lot of experience with video editing, albeit I'm a bit rusty it is something I was once quite good at.  I feel it is something I have a good eye for.

*  I am currently a systems engineer by trade.  I have a lot of various IT skills, knowledge and experience.  I've been doing that for approx 14 years now.

Anyways, let me know what you need a hand with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey PvtHopscotch.  I too live out on the NW corner of town.  I am a PC gamer as well and can think of just 2 other people I personally know that do as well so I am right there with ya.

I play just about anything but right now I'm spending a lot of time on CS:GO for some reason.  I have 195 games in my steam library so I do play quite a variety of games.  I am looking forward to Titanfall and I just joined up with the Reddit Titanfall clan.

I also have Starcraft 2, Diablo 2, blah blah blah.  I've been playing PC games for longer than I care to admit so chances are I own it or would be interested in owning it.

I also started collecting arcade machines recently.  I have a Double Dragon which works perfect, an outrun that needs some TLC and I built a 4 player mame machine last fall which is here in my home office.

In any event, if you want to add me to your Steam list I'd be interesting in playing something, anything with most folks.  My Steam name is FREAKHEAD. </TEXT>

I've traveled all over the place and things are "just right" here.  Not to say there aren't a dozen other wonderful places to live but you'll find it's a nice fit for most people.


You'll find a very wide variety of food, arts, music and many other events.  


Here are a few things I'd recommend checking out as a new resident.

* [First Friday Artwalk](http://downtownlincoln.org/firstfriday).
* [Our wonderful trails](http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/parks/parksfacilities/trails/).
* [The Farmers Market](http://lincolnhaymarket.org/events/farmers-market/) (Begins May 4th).

<TEXT> I was really lucky that my parents raised me on great classic comedy which included large doses of Laurel and Hardy.  I was the kid that went to school for Halloween as Harpo Marx and only my teachers knew who I was.

Anyways...I am a big Dick Van Dyke fan, due to the physicality of his humor and I remember seeing an interview about when me met Stan Laurel.  I was trying to find that video but couldn't.  Anyways, [HERE](http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/05/10/136145647/dick-van-dyke-talks-about-his-lucky-life-and-what-stan-laurel-left-him?ft=1 f=) is an NPR video where he talks a bit about his experience.  Also, [HERE](http://www.lettersfromstan.com/stan_eulogy.html) is the Eulogy that Dick Van Dyke read at Stan's funeral. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an original KS backer, I was pretty excited for this game.  I wasn't too bothered about the delays as it tends to happen with first time developers.  I was more annoyed they hadn't communicated it well enough but I never said anything.

Three months ago, I went from supporter to angered community member.  The newly hired "community manager" AKA someone who has the people skills of a tree stump, became the MOD over at /castlestory and then started banning people who expressed their frustration with the pace of development, lack of communication and the nonexistent merchandise some were to receive for backing them through KS. 

 
* [Response to BAN Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/1qb95g/on_the_topic_of_a_couple_recent_bans/)
* [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/CastleStory/comments/1qkh96/response_to_the_nightmare_weekend/) was a follow up of some sort, where I think they half apologized and but sounded like assholes.  They have removed the text so I am not sure what it was anymore.

They are no longer mods thankfully.  They still make smarmy response to critical posts but at least they can't ban people.  The community manager is just plan awful at handling criticism.  He took someone, like me, who was mostly indifferent to the delays and turned me into someone who can't recommend it.

If you are going to spend money on an Indie game, give it to a team that cares and may actually give you a product in the end.  If you think you'd want this game, at the very least wait until they learn how to make one.

edit...I accidentally a few words.

<TEXT> This is my favorite Cubs story and I do apologize if some of the facts are fuzzy, it was ages ago.

I had moved away from IL in 84, but spent a lot of time back there as I was growing up.  In June of 1990 I was staying with my Grandparents for a month and my Uncle got us tickets to see the Cubs.  They were playing the Mets at home.  I believe it was 6/12 b/c I feel confident that Gooden pitched but 23 years later, who knows, it could have been the day game on 6/13.  I have the ticket but its stored away and I haven't looked at it for a while.

We went really early so I could watch the players warm up and seeing some of the those legendary players up close (for both teams), it was incredible!

Strangely enough, we also saw Marlee Matlin too, who had just won an oscar a few years before.  She was dating a Mets player at the time.  I had no idea who she was, my uncle pointed her out.  

Shortly there after, my Uncle shouted to me and I turned around to see Harry Caray heading my way.  WGN was my life line after moving away and spent a ridiculous amount of time watching games during those first few summers away from "home".  I loved Harry!  I ran up to him and asked him for his autograph.  He seemed slightly annoyed and said he was really busy, but he'd give me one on the way back.  He then proceeded to head down to the dugout and disappear.  

If memory serves, I believe he was checking on the status of Mitch Williams.  I loved watching that man pitch as a kid and I think that was the point where he got injured and didn't pitch much again for the Cubs, if at all.  I just can't remember now...anyways...

So he later emerged from the dug out and I knew this was my chance.  As he came back past me I asked if I could get his autograph now...he again said he was just too busy, and I replied, "but Harry, you promised..."  Apparently my heartbroken look got to him, he smiled and took my ticket and signed it.  It said "Holy Cow, Harry Caray" and to a young kid who lived and breathed baseball (and idolized the Cubs), it was like winning the lottery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On one of post game threads, someone from TAM was arguing that T-Mart played in the game!  We had our 4 year starter and Georgia didn't.  LOL...

At least Georgia had their starter for nearly the whole season.  He is a really special QB who got overlooked too often.  T-Mart was controversial at times but deserved a better send off than he got.

In the end, you play with who you got.  Freshmen, injured, whatever...shoulda/coulda/woulda is a cop out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> just to add to this point he was indeed a big actor who was coming back from a very low point in his life.  He's been in a gazillion movies and was nominated for an Oscar for this performance in Chaplin in 1992.

Then, things spiraled out of control and to be honest, I assume he would die from a heroin over dose at some point.  Iron Man rescued his career and I'm glad b/c I enjoy watching him onscreen, no matter the role.

edit:  you can downvote me then I guess, but let's be realistic, there are folks much worse off than us.  I have a friend who just got a bonemarrow transplant a few days ago, fighting cancer since August.  My aunt is being released from the hospital today who has had pneumonia.  This has required that she stop chemo treatments she needs to fight cancer.

There are also families like [this one](http://journalstar.com/news/local/i-m-asking-for-my-mom-and-family/article_cbba4447-1ed3-5ac0-a8a0-070d451eb7c2.html) I just read about today.  

I said its ok to be disappointed but just remember that things could be worse.

<TEXT> Instead of having a pity party for ourselves, lets realize that ultimately, most of us are very lucky.  And certainly while disappointing, there are tens of millions of people, at least in here in the USA, who will feel they are having a wonderful Christmas/Holiday if they have a warm meal, a warm place to sleep or someone to spend the holiday with.  On top of that, there a untold millions fighting illness or overseas with the military.

This won't stop me from being in the Secret Santa at all.  I look forward to doing this every year, trying to get better at the "ultimate" gift, which to me isn't 29 PS3 games, although that sounds pretty sweet, but the exact gift they weren't looking for but now love.

If you are feeling frustrated, that's ok, but use that energy today to pass along a good deed and it will make you feel even better!  I also hope that each of you, if you wish, get rematched and that perfect gift finds its way to you.  

Happy Holidays! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our son was interested in joining the scouts a few years ago as well.  I was a cubscout/boyscout when I was a kid so I had many of the same feelings and see the value in many of things they teach.

At the time, I explained to my son my concerns and he agreed it was not fair that some people would be excluded based on sexual preference (although it has since changed to some degree as OP noted).

One thing I have been considering, as there is no alternative in our area, is to purchase a Boy Scout manual and then teach my son and daughters, many of those valuable skills on my own.  It would be a great way for us to spend time as a family and an opportunity for them to learn skills they don't get much exposure to.  

Best of luck! </TEXT>

Look, a lot of of us have been looking forward to this games release and put our money up to play it a long time ago but I haven't kept track of the developers favorite yogurt flavor or what time they drink their tea.  I saw a potentially great game and pledge my money to show my support.  I kept my eye on it at a distance but I wasn't glued to every detail and its silly to point out others who haven't.

Instead, lets celebrate the amount of admiration and excitement that this game is receiving and from what I've seen it is well deserved.  What great day, I'm looking forward to playing this weekend! </TEXT>

what determines the completion rate?  What if I push through the game but dont do any side quests?  It may only show 25% total progress but someone with OCD only gets to level 2 but shows 50% complete

I get what you are saying but its too subjective to work IMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this is just how shitty "fans" of anything are getting.  Game developers get death threats when they patch a game and it breaks something unintentionally.  

Attacking these student athletes who are playing a game is about as low as it gets.  I'm sure these same assholes are the ones going to little league games and screaming at the umpire.  

I went to THE University of Nebraska in the 90's when we won 3 national championships.  I know how incredible winning can be.  However, I don't have a meltdown and lock myself in my room when we have a bad game.  BUT I assure you, anytime a Husker fumbles (which is often), there are 10 assclowns tweeting that player and telling him he sucks.  We had a potentially great quarterback but he got ridiculed for 4 years for the way he threw the ball.  That kid busted his ass for our university and took hits that would make me shit my pants.  He played injured, hobbled and never complained.  He deserved our thanks but he was asked endlessly about this throwing motion, it was analyzed in slow mo video on ESPN and Big 10 network and then when he made mistakes, the freaks would come out of the wood work (myself excluded) and tweet to him or rant on message boards.  I don't know how these kids can do it.

Our coach had a mega meltdown on Friday and I would too.  The expectations should always be high but when you get a 24/7 media breathing down the neck of a 19 year old kid and anytime he makes the slightest mistake, you have a bunch of grumpy old codgers personally attacking them, I'd unleash the Kracken myself.

I'm so disgusted with "fans" this year....it may have always been like this but it seems worse this year, all around, for any team.

Good luck to this kid, he doesn't deserve any of this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's a good kid, did everything that was asked of him and beyond.  He was never in trouble, good student, lot of charity work.  He just wasn't hip enough for the media at times and he fell into that trap of trying to do too much when we fell behind and I think he just couldn't over come the injuries that have added up.  

The first half of his freshman season were pretty incredible.  Go back and watch some highlights, pretty awesome stuff.  Here are the highlights from the OK State game ( [LINK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPF2qDw45k4) ).  

Edit - Here is the K-State game, which was my favorite that year.  (  [LINK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVI64Yih2Ug).

I wish him the best! </TEXT>

It's like how they always wait for Bo to start yelling on the sidelines but when you watch any other football game, the other coaches are just as upset and animated but its brushed off.  Lazy "journalism".

* do parent only
* remove casino type games, can't remember what they were called (those whacky Japanese games).
* remove games that require controls you don't have on your cabinet

I just sort of narrowed it down like that, I'm sure there were more things to remove.  I even think there is a Video with recommendations on Don's site.

In addition to that, I purchased a sub to EmuMovies and then used that to get to my final list.  It took a number of hours but I was happy with the results. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have said...

I love our game and our company so much, that it allowed me to overreact to negative comments.  This was wrong and I am incredibly sorry.

Our company has made major mistakes and we are working to overcome those.  You all have every right to be mad and frustrated and we should  allow you to vent those frustrations, especially on a site such as Reddit.  

If you will allow me, I want to spend everyday moving forward trying to re-earn your respect.  I want to show you the exciting things we have in the pipeline and I want to prove to you that although we are very late on delivering this product, that it was well worth the time and your investment.

My job as a community manager is not to police our users, it is to represent our company in a positive light and give you a reason to be excited for Castle Story.  

I have failed to do that and for that I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies.

As you can see I am married so I've had to apologize a lot in my life. :) 

As stated before, I haven't posted on here or the forums.  I am disappointed at the delays and all the other drama going on but I haven't said a word.  I was in indie development at one point at the turn of the century.  I know how frustrating it can be.  Our team was doing it in our spare time with zero budget and no time line or schedule and we still had people riding our ass every day about updates for a game we hadn't even released or sold.  We had never done anything other than Map Packs for various games so we were also learning on the fly.  It became too much for some and they moved on to greater things.  This is why I'd never get after a dev for a delayed game.

I do get upset when people who are rightfully upset get banned on Reddit by the game devs.  This is the only reason I spoke up.  You took someone who wasn't mad and gave me a reason to be.  It was a dumb dumb move but its now over.    This is a defining moment, in my opinion.  Don't walk away with your head down or frustrated with the community.  Go ...*they are right, we need to make this fun and exciting again*... then set out a way to do that.

We all want you to succeed and I am certainly rooting you on.  Give us a reason to spread the word.  Remember, winning cures everything.

Best of luck to you and your team.

<TEXT> I am a kickstarter backer of this game and while I subscribed to this subreddit some time ago, I've never once posted.

I have certainly been disappointed in the progress of this project but as someone who was involved in Indie development ages ago, I can appreciate the challenges it can present.

However, this is a clear example of not only completely blowing it with the community that supported the project, it is also an example of how not to fix things when you screw up.  

The smarmy half apology is unfortunate and the little faith I had left in your company is now gone.

The only thing I would agree with is you screwed up.  I do it constantly, all the time, endlessly.  Honest screw ups should be expected but we are measured by how we respond to those screw ups.  Your "apology" or explanation or whatever it is, comes across as a defense for acting like a fool and your subsequent comments are smarmy and are not mending fences.  

You shouldn't consider, not being a jerk as "Unknown Territory".  This is really common sense but here are some big tips for you, since you need it.

* We are your investors.  Consider this first before you comment or react.  We believed in your company and gave you money to show just how much. 

* We are probably the best marketing tools at your disposal.  Treat us as such and give us a reason to want to share our experience with your game.

* If you don't have anything nice to say....DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

* This is our community, not Sauropod's.

As an example of HOW to do things, I purchased an indie game for $15 about 2 years ago.  It was in alpha and certainly not perfect.  That developer created a community that we wanted to support, that we cheered on and made me want to talk about all the time.  They treated their community with respect, responded to critics with respect and communicated often.

That game finally launched on Steam a few weeks back and after all this time, they have a great solid product, a large community that is growing and a game I still play all the time, 2 years later.

You can do that here.  This is that defining moment.  Say I am sorry, I really screwed up and there is no reason for it.  Remove yourself totally as a mod, of any kind, and work to rebuild these relationships and build a fun exciting community.  People were already mad and frustrated, rightfully so...your moderation made it much much worse.  

Don't make excuses.  Don't be defensive.  You screwed up...that is acceptable.  The response...could be better.  Don't be a white knight.

As long as I see SauropodBox listed as an admin, I have zero faith that things are salvageable.

Best of luck to you and your company.  I hope you are able to turn things around. </TEXT>

Fans are different.  I'm sure yours are like ours...1/3 think you will win by 20 points, 1/3 think it will be a close battle and it could go either way and the final 1/3 think your team will shit the bed.

<TEXT> You can measure angles in Sketchup.  For myself, I used a table saw to cut that angle but as stated by Button-Masher you can cut angles with  circular saws as well.  Even my jig-saw allows me to cut at an angle so there are options.

When the control panel meets the bezel, its another angle to cut to make it flush or you can use some sort of a metal bracket that could be bent to fit the angle.  it could be similar to what you will use for the marquee.

I went through all of this when I built mine too.  You may need consider what tools you have when you design your cabinet.  Don't design what you can't produce. </TEXT>

I kid I kid...I've used my pi as a nes/snes emulator for my kids and it worked great.  I utilized a powered usb hub and 2 xbox controllers that we had.

I would like to build a single player bartop with only a few select "classic" games for my father-in-law and I do want to test it as an option.  I think in that instance it would be viable.  If not, I have an old laptop that I could use.  

I would agree that if you want to use a Pi, to have reasonable expectations on what you will be able to play and some of the challenges it will present.  I would also agree that a desktop pc will give you more options and flexibility and is the better way to go.

Good post, always do a ton of research before spending any money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem was only when using *any* front end and when I changed the game selection and the new video preview played, it would flicker, like if you changed the channel, S-VIDEO would come up in giant green letters..  If there were no videos, no flicker.  My understanding is that it was a problem with refresh rate but no matter what third party app I used to adjust that, no change in behavior.  I had spent SO much time on configuring the front ends and the extra cost for emumovies, I just could t abandon that work to use a different front end or no videos.  I didn't really have a chance to think about your suggestion since I first read it.  Your recommendation had to do with mame and all the games work fine, looked glorious.

I certainly could have "lived with it" but I figure I can work out the bugs on the side and the family/friends still have something to enjoy until then.

I saw a few other AGP cards on various sites and ebay.  I think I might still have a few more hiding around here somewhere.  In a worst case scenario, I am going to be upgrading my main pc here in the next 3-4 months.  I thought about testing it with my current rig and if it resolves it, waiting until then and using that hardware.  

I appreciate you taking all this time to consider my issue and offer suggestions.  It means a lot that you would do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you the thumbs up on the design and great question.  The challenging part (to me) about building one of these was, you will find STRONG varied opinions on every single thing.  With regards to this, ultimately, my Double Dragon has glass and I like that i can pull that out and clean it and it looks new.  On a few cabs I've seen around, with the plexi, it has tiny scratches and doesn't look quite as good. That doesn't mean that would be the case here, but it was what I considered when weighing options.  

I have 3 kids who will touch the "screen" so I thought it would be the best way to go.  For the cost, it's only about $15, I think the plexi was comparable so if I decide I don't like it, I can change it.  I was also on the fence about tinting.  I decide against it b/c some felt it diminished the colors and I will rarely play "in the dark".  Again, for the price, I can get that later as well.  The nice thing about these is nothing is set in stone, I can always change some aspects if I don't like it later on.  It's a learning process with 200 miles of wiggle room. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did it to save space on each side and the back.  The back was 8" deeper with the case, 12" total for the sides and I believe about 6" on the top.  I couldn't meet my size requirements otherwise.

I would have also been able to build my own bezel to clean up the look...the case was silver...I was also hoping to rewire the power/input button as well.

You don't have to do that and I have seen many folks just set it in there and build with it in mind, or paint the existing bezel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would consider myself a novice as well.  I had never built one and I'm sure if I did another it would turn out better, of course, but there is so much to know and learn, it's what makes it attractive.

I'll try to answer your questions the best I can.

* MDF is the type of wood I used, 3/4".  It is extremely dusty.  It basically turns into a very fine powder and will get everywhere.  Cut as much as you can outside.  

* the paint wasn't too much of a problem.  I applied a 50/50 mixture of glue and water to the cabinet first, as my sealer and sanded it a ton.  I painted it with a roller, then sanded anything that I had concerns about. Then painted again.  The side art material can bring out the flaws more than paint so keep that in mind. 

* Screws, I dont remember.  I believe they were 1 1/4" in length, wood screws.  The biggest mistake I made here is I put the screws in from the outside.  At the time it made sense, I was worried about them screws coming through the other side.  In reality that wouldn't have happened and I had to fill in and sand dozens up dozens of holes.

* I believe this is the light I used [LINK](http://www.menards.com/main/lighting-fans/indoor-lights/accent-lights/fluorescent-20-white-undercabinet-bar/p-1779157-c-6349.htm).  I think it looks great, very similar to my original arcades.

* I did not countersink the joysticks.  I mounted them underneath and they are just like my Double Dragon ones.

Tips??

*  Plan, plan and then plan.  Buy some cardboard and build the design to make sure you will like it and it will fit. 

*  Think forward....future proof the system as much as you can.  Make it easy to add/remove components down the line.

*  Don't order the T-Molding until you are nearly complete.  I underestimated and had a strip that wasn't quite long enough, so I had to order more.  The min order was 20ft so I have two strips of left over I can't use.

* The one question I always wanted to ask on Reddit before my build (but I didnt) was, what was one thing you wish you knew before you started?  Now that I am done and can answer that.  The build will be harder and take longer than you expect.  Assume you will go over budget and plan for it.  Realize there is so much to know that you will overlook something and/or make a mistake...that is ok and part of the fun. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Arcadium: Completed my first Mame cabinet from scratch. /x Post from Mame. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-01 21:41:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I built a Mame cabinet from scratch for my son's 10th Birthday.  We had the party last Saturday and it was a big hit.

* Here is a small imgur album:  [LINK](https://imgur.com/a/DQ9Zl).
* I wrote small blog on the project if you want to see more images: [LINK](http://myarcadium.blogspot.com/).

A few items to note.  I originally started out with a 27" tv and it looked great!!  However, late in the process I ran into problems with it.  With little time left, I used a 4:3 LCD I had but that's something that can be upgraded later.  Second, I purchased a pane of glass to cover the bezel. It is too snug of a fit so I will need to get a little bit trimmed off before I can properly install it.  It felt as if the paint was going to get scratched OR the glass might crack.  Not worth it obviously.

I wanted to post this here as well b/c this is the subreddit where I rekindled my love and appreciation for the original arcade machines.  I had no idea I could buy them for a reasonable price until I stumbled upon this place.  I now have an awesome Double Dragon that works perfect and an Outrun I'm still restoring.  I plan to continue purchasing and restoring original cabinets but I thought this was a great way to expose my kids to some incredible games we simply don't see around our parts.  They think an Arcade is a place to win tickets to trade for plastic toys.

Thank you all! </TEXT>

<TEXT> with my j-pac, I had several buttons with the same keycode.  It took me a bit to understand the reprogramming but once I "got it" it was easy.  I am not sure if the i-pac is the same as a j-pac but here is what I did.

* connect the ps/2 keyboard into the passthrough port on the j-pac
* note what keys share the same keycode and any others you want to change. Also note what is available to use as replacement keys
* open notepad, press cntrl/alt/p (this will be where the built in progamming "displays" its text)
* press a button, then press the replacement keyboard button
* once done, press e (I think)

This took me a bit to figure out, I don't feel the instructions were clear but I am also a slow, small brained moron.  :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, to add one final thing.  Another thing you can do is use Sketchup.  They have a free version of their 3D program and if you google "sketchup insert favorite cab name model" you will likely find a free available 3d model that you can use to help with your final design.  I based mine off of a Double Dragon cabinet but when it changed to a 4 player cab, I expanded my existing design and then looked at the TMNT cabinet for some good control panel dimensions.

---edit

I was curious if I had misread the Diabetes thing but here is something from a recent [article](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/09/tom-hanks-type-2-diabetes):

"The actor  who lost 13kg (two stone) for Philadelphia and 25kg for Castaway, and gained 13kg for A League of Their Own  said that "may have had something to do" with his having type 2 diabetes, "because you eat so much bad food and you don't get any exercise when you're heavy".

But Hanks said he had had the symptoms for 20 years. "I think I was genetically inclined to get it and I think it goes back to a lifestyle I've been leading since I was probably seven, as opposed to 36."" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched a big chunk of the game and the only thing I was left wondering, why did they take out Kain when they got to the red zone...he'd get them there and then ole Passy McPasserson would come in and the defense would just full out blitz him.  I think some of the offense calls were questionable but what do I know.

Overall I was really impressed with Northwestern.  On TV, they often looked half the size of their counterparts but I could tell they wanted to win more than the other team and no one was going to get in their way.  They looked prepared, they were mentally and physically tough and they are going to be a very hard team for the rest of us in this division to beat.

They'll bounce back and play great....just need to get those Alums to show up to the games and support a great program.

I think I used it for SNES too, but can't remember now.  I used Don's renamer for the others.

I'm nearly done with my software side of this project and I'm on step 987 out of 1000 so its hard to remember exactly but I want to say I renamed all my roms before I was able to or before I tried to use Don's list generator.

<TEXT> Welcome to Lincoln, I'm originally from Rockford.  Moved to Nebraska when I was a kid but spent most my summers back there.  Grew up watching WGN all summer long, it was the only thing that made me feel at home out here  I moved to Chicago after college but then came back to Lincoln to help with my friends project, met my wife, bam, 11 years later I'm still here.

  I really love Lincoln, but every time I get to Chicago it reminds me how much I miss it.  If you need anything, shoot me a message! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That game and the company behind it changed so many people's lives. 

I just graduated from college in 1999, a degree in Theatre.  I took a summer job at "Software Etc" (now Gamestop) while trying to decide where to go next.  The job offered more than my position at local cable company working with Cable Access, and heck, I owned a nintendo and a playstation so I thought, what the hell.  

I spent a lot of time looking at the damn HL box which featured information about Team Fortress Classic on the back.  "Coincidentally" I needed a computer so I could perform some video editing at home and so I used some of my savings to build my very first computer from scratch, mind you I have an arts degree essentially.  Building a computer was incredibly interesting, challenging (at the time) and it was fun.

  I then started playing HL and Team Fortress Classic....then several mods including Day of Defeat.  Then I discovered that I could make maps myself so I put my Set/Scene/Lighting/Sound design skills to work trying to make maps for Day of Defeat and I also start working on various mods (even had a pics of one my maps in PC Gamer UK).  

  I then start working with a mapping design team focusing on Day of Defeat only and many of those maps my team made were in DOD 1.3 and eventually were in the retail version.

  Our team then started to work on our own independent game but things sort of fell apart from there.  However, many of those guys went on to work for big time studios and are still working for them.  Some worked for Valve for a while too.

Right as things started to take off, my wife and I started our family so I focused instead on my "day job", which had become and still is in I.T.  Today I have an incredible job in a field I love but I never would have discovered without HL.

  Think of all those mods and how many of those folks went on to do amazing things in the gaming industry.  I am not one of them but I am truly thankful that HL gave me an excuse to build a PC and gave me an excuse to discover and learn more.

TLDR:  HL made me want to build a computer and now I'm in I.T.

<TEXT> I have purchased more indie games from developers than from Steam and although your 99% is pulled out of the air and you have no statistics to point to, I agree if I had a choice as a dev, I would want my game on Steam b/c it will get a lot of exposure.  However, I have yet to hear of a game that was amazing and I didn't buy it or hear about it b/c it wasn't on steam. I didn't say, "oh man, I would have bought that if it was on Steam".  Now, I have said that about "Console Exclusives".

But ultimately it is a store...They have tried to offer a solution, a pathway, for indie developers who do not have a publisher and its not perfect, but its going in the right direction.  It sounds like it will be pretty incredible once they get there.

But Valve is in no way the only gateway to the kingdom.  If I want my game on Xbox, you better believe I have to go through Microsoft.  If I want to publish on PC, I want to be on Steam I suppose, but I wouldn't have a big hissy fit if they won't publish my game.  I guess to me it seems that Valve just can't win.

I was in indie game development ages ago.  Many of my former peers are in the game industry today.  There are so many avenues for indie devs now, it's wonderful and amazing and I wish this was all around 14 years ago.  If you make a great game, you will sell it, with or without Steam.  I have 100% zero doubt.  If you have a so-so or niche game, then yeah, you will help your sales by being in the biggest store.

<TEXT> b/c Valve is a store, not a platform.  If you want to be on Xbox, you must go through Microsoft, if you want to be on PS3, you have to go through Sony.  If you want to be on WII U, you have to go through Nintendo, etc.

If you want to be on PC, you can go through a number of distribution channels or set up a website, post on Reddit and say, buy my stuff.

If they dont like how Valve does things, then why bitch, use something different.  There are lots of choices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To me it sounds like Valve understands there are issues and are working towards a solution.  I'm not sure its worth getting all up in arms whenever some indie developer whines.  What would so many of these indie developer have done years ago when there was no digital distribution.  

  Valve is a store, not a platform, and they are trying to provide a way for someone from a small team/company to market and sell their game without having to beg a publisher to help them, and all they get is shit from folks.  

They have stated it's not perfect and they are working towards a solution that sounds like a win/win for everyone.  You can't make dramatic changes over-night and this "me now" attitude needs to be readjusted.

Indie developers didn't have that sort of avenue at one point and everyone said, "hey Valve, you should look at this".  They then offer it and all I hear is "OMG I bought a shitty game from a STORE b/c I am too lazy to Google the title and learn more about it".  "It's Valve's fault for not playing it".  

I totally agree it's not perfect but don't be an impulse buyer, do some reading FFS and don't blame others b/c you didn't.  There are many AAA games that are AWFUL, should Valve not sell those either? </TEXT>

I'd be happy to help /r/cade with its wiki and so forth.  I even asked one time if someone could help me understand how to make changes to the wiki.  I can't seem to make any edits or it's not obvious to my tiny brain where to do that at.  I was going to make one on my own but figured it would be better time spent if I could improve the one on here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Sandberg and I grew up watching him, Grace, Dunston, Dawson, etc.  Those are my boys.

I read a really great article before Sveum was chosen, talking about if they should give Ryne a shot.  He did everything the old regime asked and but they made a lot of great points about why he wouldn't be a great manager, several which have been mentioned in this thread.  

I think the most interesting one, though, was that we all love him because of what a great person and player he was for the Cubs.  He was an idol for so many of us.  If he failed, and failed spectacularly, it would affect his legacy and what we think of him.

How long did it take Bill Buckner before he could come back to Fenway.  He was a great player whose entire career is now a flash in our minds of a simple error.  

What if Ryne botched a call that cost the Cubs a World Series shot, he'd never be able to survive that.  Not that it would affect how I thought of him but it was an interesting point, one I never considered.

I wish him a great deal of luck and success.  I'm sorry to see that he has to start out like this but sometimes opportunity knocks and you have to step up and answer. </TEXT>

Curt likes to blame the governor constantly, but who is at fault for the years of poor decision making, throwing money around and completely missing deadlines.  You can't blame any investor for saying, I'm going to tap out here.

I wanted them to succeed but this is on Curt and those he hired to help him run the company.

<TEXT> Rule 1 of Arcade Club...Arcade Machines Are Heavy as HELL!
Rule 2 of Arcade Club...Arcade Machines Are Heavy as HELL!

I've moved 3 of these buggers so far.  One in the back of my truck...had to lay down b/c it was heavy as HELL.  the second in the back of our mini-van b/c it was raining and the third, my fellow /r/cade redditor down the street hauled one in his SUV.

They are manageable with 2 people but a few more is advisable.  The two I have are in my garage until I can complete their restores, the third my fellow redditor wanted in his basement and it wasn't terrible getting it down the stairs, but certainly the weight was a challenge.

With two people, you typically lay a blanket down in the back of the truck, get it close to the tail gate and then tip into the back.  When unloading, same deal, slide it out until you can use gravity to safely lower it to the ground.  Most units have wheels on the back so you can tip it and drag it around.
  When I purchased my Out Run, which needs a lot of work, I strapped a 4 wheel dolly to the bottom so I could wheel it around to work on.  
  If you want to move into a basement, I know John from John's Arcade recommended a Hand Truck/Cart with wheels on the back.  I think that was a great idea.

Just be careful and congrats on your purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you search this reddit, you should see some unique designs.  One thing you could do, which I did, is to use Google Sketchup.  It is a free 3d modeling application.  Then google for "sketchup arcade cabinet" and you can play around with existing designs if you wish.


--edit--

Also I did a quck google search and found dozens of "new/modern/different" designs.  Here is a forum link with quite a few:

<TEXT> We have a similar rotation where I work.  

1.  Primary on-call page

if no acknowledgement within 15 minutes...

2.  Secondary on-call page

if no acknowledgement within 15 minutes...

3.  Manager Page

Basically...you don't want to be a dick to your buddies/coworkers/peers and you definitely don't want your manager to get a page...so your goal is to never roll a page to the next guy and if you need to be out of pocket for a bit, the secondary will cover for you.

Once you complete your primary on-call rotation, you move to secondary on-call.  

It's about respecting those you work with and for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome from Chicago.  I'm originally from Rockford and also lived in Chicago for a few years after college (UNL Grad).  

There are games that air occasionally on the weekends that can be blocked out, even on MLB.TV (Cub fan here).  In my experience those have been ESPN weekend night games, but there could be others.  It is only a few games a season.

If you feel it is must see, you may just want to slowly sip a beer at a local bar who is airing the game.  There are a number of sports bars that you can call ahead and they can put the game on for you during that time frame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> prices can vary but certainly 4k is crazy unless it's "brand new".  Typically I see them anywhere from 250 to 900 but there are so many versions and quality can vary so price is always hard to know.  Also I dont know the first thing about those units, not really my thing.

Just set yourself a budget and stick to it.  Find a good Craigs List app for our phone and configure it for "arcade" in your area and when you see one pop up, respond right away, check it out and don't be afraid to walk away if it is in poor shape.  

I drove 250 miles to get my Double Dragon for $200 so there are bargains to be had, just have to be super patient. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see one of those units on Craig's List more often than any other.  If I were you, and there is no time constraints, then I'd watch there for a few weeks or months until you find exactly what you need.

If you live in a more rural area, maybe look at Ebay and search within a specific range, like 200 miles.  

Additionally, you can look on the "arcade museum" site and their forums:   [LINK](http://www.arcade-museum.com/) .  On the main page, you can "search" for specific machines, click on the one you want and I believe it will indicate how many or their users have one for sale.  OR you can go to their forums and look under Video Game sales.  You do have to donate a few dollars to the site for use of their forums but is worth it. </TEXT>

Here is the relevant section:

* Firstly, for existing paid members, nothing much will change except youll be part of a larger community. You wont have to repurchase a licence, be forced to use steam, or anything like that. Youll still be able to log in with non steam credentials.

* For existing free members, your access will be limited to classic KAG only. You will have to pay for the game through one of the many available means to access the full version.

* For server hosts, youll still be able to host servers with the normal methods, but may have extra options for steam specific things, like filtering players out via VAC.

* For people whod like to buy but cant due to payment method issues, youll have access to all the payment options of a large, well supported platform like Steam!

* More money for us, which will mean were less stressed about being able to pay rent, food and bills and able to focus more on finalising KAG and working on other games! </TEXT>

Also, the "beta" is out, which is quite a bit different then the classic "alpha" version but is also loads of fun.  You can download that from the forums if you own a copy of the game.

They are coming to Steam at some point as well and Steam keys will be provided if you have already purchased it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got my DD about a month ago.  I got a manual with mine but really it didn't have enough to guide me if I would of had to take it completely apart.  Thankfully mine was in really good shape on the interior and just needed a new buttons, cleaned up and some exterior work (still in progress).

*IF* I had to take it apart, I would label every connection so that reassembly would go smooth.  As mentioned by Zomza, get some Simple Green or "Mean Green" at the dollar store (which is what I use) and clean the exterior surfaces.  I'd then take off the control panel.  That is where the joystick and buttons are.  On DD there are clampy things on the inside you have to unfasten.  Once that is off, this will allow you to remove the plexi protecting the monitor.  Remove that and the bezel and clean the monitor   plexi with glass cleaner.  THIS alone made a huge difference for me.  I thought I was going to have to recap my monitor but removing 26 years of grime made it look almost new (tear).  

I'd also consider replacing your buttons   microswitches, at the very least, so that they match and it will def. play a bit better.  I bought 6 new buttons and micro-switches and with shipping it was around $11/$12.  [http://groovygamegear.com/webstore/](http://groovygamegear.com/webstore/)

Then from there it depends on how far you want to clean it up.  You can buy new control panel art pretty easily but I'm having some problems locating side art but I'm sure I'll track something down or will have it made.  Once I confirm I can get new side art I will move forward with the complete cabinet restore.

Good Luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's difficult to say.  Location, sellers knowledge, demand in the market, condition of the machine all play a factor.  I'd set a spending limit, which you have, but keep that to yourself.  I'd set up an e-bay alert as well as a Craig's List one specifically for "arcade".

I'd also spend the $2 and sign up for the KLOV/VAPS forum.  I watch the "For Sale" subforum like a hawk.  There is a Qbert on there now someone is selling for $900.

[KLOV - QBert](http://forums.arcade-museum.com/showthread.php?t=280330_)  If you don't live near that seller then at least use them as a gauge for price.  In that example, if you lived near them, say, "hey, I'll give you $700 and I'll pick it up tomorrow and get it out of your way".  Don't be afraid to haggle a little and don't over pay just to have it.

You can also setup a profile on their main-site and you can configure your profile to list any Arcade Machine you are looking for.  I wanted to get a Double Dragon and I was contacted by a seller through that site.  He offered it for a fair price but then one popped up on Craig's List for $100 cheaper so ultimately I found what I wanted by being patient and keeping my eyes open.

Best of luck and I hope you find what you are looking for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just to emphasize how much of a difference cleaning the monitor can make, on my double dragon I recently got, I thought there was an issue with red objects on the screen.  I was trying to determine if it was a problem with the monitor or the board but nothing helped.  Finally had time to take it apart to clean and to assess what I needed to buy for my restore.  I cleaned the monitor and the plexi and magically my red came back and my monitor looks amazing.  

I was shocked how much those 24 years of dust affected the screen.  I wish I would have thought to take pictures.

Thanks again for another great video John.  I'm learning a lot...as a new hobbyist, you are certainly making me feel more comfortable around these machines. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was lucky enough to catch Brad in concert once.  There were literally 7 people there, and 4 of them were with me.

It is still one of the best show's I've ever seen.  I got to visit with Stone after the concert and he was incredibly nice, signed our Green River cassette (welp) and asked us how we liked the show.

Afterwards, we were eating at Perkins up the street and their tour bus pulled up in front.  They ordered some food to go and were just sitting there in the lobby.  My friends and I couldn't resist so we sat with Stone and Shawn Smith and geeked out a bit.  I'm certain I asked a bunch of dumb-ass questions and if I could go back, I have so many things I'd want to talk about.    According to google, this was in October of 97...yikes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's been said on here a few times, but I have no issue with Mame cabinets at all.  I plan to build on myself at some point soon, but from scratch.

The true problem, in my eyes, is that when I see an old cabinet come up on Craig's List.  There are several of us in my area that want to buy and restore these iconic cabinets but there are an equal number of "flippers" that will beat us to them. 

  They take these great old cabinets, gut them, put mame or a 60-1 in them and then resell them a week later for $500-$1500 more.  It must be a great business model b/c they sell quick but why ruin a classic unit.  

Just last week there as a table top Donkey Kong about 2 1/2 hours away for $150.  Needed a little TLC and it'd be as good as new.  I didn't feel like driving that far but I should have b/c a few days later, back on craigs list, with a 60 in 1 in it and for $550.

I certainly can't blame them, obviously they are making good money on them and it's better than seeing them get tossed into a dump.  It's kind of a travesty to me but it's just how it goes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I picked up my "holy grail" machine last night.  I know it's not as thrilling as some others out there but when I was a kid, my best friend and I used to spend a lot of time and money on this machine.  I am so excited to have it in my garage.

[Double Dragon Album](http://imgur.com/a/FbbUo).

Redditor [/u/yatzr/](http://www.reddit.com/user/yatzr) deserves a huge thanks and some sort of medal for enduring the 5 hour round trip with me, through some pretty nasty thunderstorms, to secure this machine.  

We unloaded it around midnight last night, discovered all the manuals inside the cab and Yatzr used his Arcade Kungfu to determine 2 stuck microswitches were causing some control issues.  The cab is actually in great shape.  There are some scratches and a damaged corner at the bottom but other than that, its pretty good.

The guy I bought it from also had a non-working Robocop in a bit of a generic cabinet.  He also had a nintendo cabinet that had been converted to a NEO GEO with Metal Slug X.  Due to the bad weather, I had to take our van so I couldn't make it fit.  The monitor was a little flakey but I'd taken it if I had my truck.

Overall, I'm really excited.  Going to order all new microswitches and buttons today, just because and spend fathers day kicking ass with my kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The frustrating part is that there are true gamers out there that WONT be able to buy this unit that would normally want to.

My father for example, is retired and has trouble getting around.  He is a pretty antsy fellow and his XBOX 360 gives him something to occupy his time.  I realize a 60 year old man isn't their demo, but that dude buys more games than I do and I'm in my 30's with 3 kids.

My dad cant do "always on" simply b/c they dont need internet for anything else and spending the additonal monthly fee for broadband plus the xbox gold (or whatever) is a huge add-on.  When he has to update his 360, he's bring it to my house.  He also buys and sells used games.  Not always, but often.  

My Dad was really excited about the new XBOX but when I explained to him this may not work for him, he was bummed.

Yes he can keep using his 360 but the point is, Microsoft lost a new console sale b/c they somehow believe this is a reasonable long term strategy.  And seeing how the console is around for about 8-10 years, that's a lot of dollars he may have spent over that time period.  Some of their philosophies from their software side are now showing up in their gaming division.

I've had pretty much all of the consoles, Atari, NES, SNES, Genesis, Playstation, Dreamcast, PS2, Wii, PS3, XBox 360.  I don't have a loyalty, I go where I feel I will get the most value and return on my investment.  The Original Xbox seemed to play off the, "we don't play by the console rules" sort of rebel vibe.  Now they've grown old and adopted policies they would have rejected back then (Hippy turned Yuppie).   </TEXT>

<TITLE> I finally found my first cab, Sega Out Run! </TITLE>

[Manual](http://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/O/Outrun%20Upright%20Parts%20Manual.pdf)

I've been hunting for a cab (or two) to do a restore on and teach myself more about these great icons from my childhood.  I've been searching for several months and just came across this Sega Out Run for $80.

I picked it up last night, and with the help of fellow redditor [Yatzer](http://www.reddit.com/user/yatzr) who I recently learned lived just 2 blocks down the street from me, we unloaded and started to try and resurrect this gem.

The previous owner said it was working fine and recently when he was playing the screen shut off and it started to hum.

The outside is pretty rough but nothing too serious.  Will need to be sanded and painted, and new side art applied.  The gas petal is pretty rusty but the Marque looks perfect and when I saw it light up, I got pretty giddy.

The cab powers on but it hums (I believe from the speakers) and you can hear some very faint squiggly voices on the speakers but it's just jibberish.  The marque and one of the coin slots lights up and there is a red light on the PCB that lights up as well.  

There is no video nor does the monitor appear to "power on".  The previous owner removed the original monitor b/c it didn't work right and sold that a while back on Craig's List for a $1 :( .  He replaced it with a smaller monitor that we are still trying to learn more about it.  It's a Mitsubishi something or another, I'll need to look closer this weekend.  I believe the original though was a 19" Hantarex display.

We tried the test buttons but nothing happened.  We also dropped a few quarters in the coin slot but alas, no results.

Looking over the PCB it appears to be in good shape. I removed then reattached all the connectors and that didn't improve things. 

The bottom of the inside is a bit dirty and we thought perhaps the first item that needs attention is the power supply.  The manual for this cab (listed at the top) does a great job of detailing the somewhat intimidating layout of that area.  I'd like to go through this whole area and clean it up, maybe that will help or lead to more answers.

I've only had a few brief hours with it and just started my cursory hunt for more information.  It'd be great if there was an easy way for me to test these components but I may just need to get dirty and try and figure it all out.

I appreciate you all letting me share my excitement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I too am in Lincoln/Omaha area and I too scan CL every single day.  I am sad that I have to compete with a fellow /cade person for so few items.  I'm looking for my very first arcade to restore with my son who just turned 9.  I've been looking for several months and I'm just going to be patient b/c I think most of the folks around here are wanting an inflated price and obviously are getting it in some cases.

I responded to that $75 Street Fighter 2 as soon as it was posted and my heart was crushed when I didn't get a response.  I then saw that same machine as a 60-1 and I was puzzled.  You are right, flippers are beating us to this.

I've also seen a lot of ads where they have 8 machines, 2 work, but they will only sell them as a bundle for some ridiculous price.  The 2 that work are usually two I'd never want so I couldn't justify even if I wanted to consider them.

Yatzr, I wish you the best of luck.  I'm really new at this and I'm excited   to get my first box.  I've also been watching E-Bay a lot and between the two I hope to have success. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it as 1999, I was just about to graduate college with a BA in Theatre production.  I also worked in TV and Film production but always relied on equipment provided by my school or employer for editing.  I was now going to need my own rig to do all that and anything on the market from the PC manufacturers cost a bundle.

I did a lot of research and then I took money I was gifted at graduation and built my very first computer.  I found the passion for something I had no idea I would love.  Never owned a computer, never really used them much except to write papers.  There I stood in front of a heap of wires and I loved it.  (Celeron 466, 128 Mb of RAM, 3dFX 3500 with tv in/out, 20 Gb HD).

Flash forward 14 years and I find myself in my 12th year of I.T. work and in an advanced specialization supporting fortune 500 companies.  I love *most* days, but it is I.T. after all. :)

It all started with that first computer I built, it changed my life. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I work from home and it's the best work experience I've ever had.  

  I'm employed by a very large company, specifically in the IT services division.  When I started with the company I went to the office 99% of the time but was given the flexibility to work from home if I wasn't feeling well or if we had bad weather/a delivery/a plumber coming, etc and needed to be home.
  I was recently promoted to a more specialized position in our overall team and the others I work with directly are all 100% remote, even though they are U.S. based and physically near the office.  It's just how they've always functioned and after 15 years and a good track record they just leave them alone.  It was then a perk that I took advantage of when I joined that team, with the blessing of my manager.

I used to get up 6:00 am, do my thing, pack up my gear and get out the door by 7:15 am to fight traffic and get to my office/desk by 7:45 am.  At the office I was interrupted a lot by normal office banter, people coming and going, bathroom/lunch, etc.  I'd then leave at 5:00 pm and get home by 5:30 pm...then setup my laptop just in case I was needed for an emergency or if I was on-call.  Then start all over again the next day.

I now roll out of bed at 6:45 am, turn on the coffee, take a shower, sit down at my desk by 7:15 am and start working.  The bathroom is 8 steps away instead of 200.  The "lunch room" is 20 steps away instead of 250.  I can listen to my music as loud as I want and no one is going to interrupt me while I'm trying to focus on an important task.  I'm much more productive and the time I used to waste commuting, chit-chatting, going to and from lunch/coffee/bathroom is now time used for work.  I save a ton of money on gas and vehicle maintenance and I get to see my kids before they head off to school and as they get home.  If something comes up and I have to "work late", I can run up the kitchen, grab some food, and my mind isn't distracted by hunger or my wife calling asking how late I'm going to be.

I still go into the office from time to time to see my friends and we go out for lunch but I can tell you it has been wonderful.  It's not for everyone and you must be self disciplined but for the right folks, it can be an incredible opportunity.  If you run an organization and you hire the right folks, give them this as an option.  With a multitude of instant messaging options, voip, vpns, I'm really puzzled that a company would waste money on real estate and heating/cooling an office when this could work for a portion of their staff. 

 I've been doing this nearly a year and it has made me a better employee (productivity wise), it has made me a happier employee and it has given me more of a home life than I've ever had during my 12 years in I.T.  This is even when my responsibilities and workload are at the highest in my career.

edit;  TLDR - I work from home and it rules. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been looking to build a mame and/or refurbish an arcade machine for some time.  I have a 9 year old and as we are about to move into a much larger space, I have the room finally to begin this long promised project.  Something fun for the two of us to work on together.

I've been watching Craig's list for some old shells and I also designed one to build from scratch.

Suddenly an After Burner Deluxe Cockpit style pops up on Craig's List for $75.  He even offered to deliver all 900lbs to my place. Here are the pics.

[Image 1](http://i.imgur.com/4iXtDqf.jpg)

[Image 2](http://i.imgur.com/zwTm8pH.jpg)

He said it's been rewired and everything works, "just needs a motherboard".

I think this could be fun but it could also be that thing using up a third stall in my garage.  Does anyone have any experience with these, is it worth the hassle or should I pass?

I appreciate your time and thank you in advanced for your comments.

<TEXT> Wow, love Mr. Bungle!  I can finally tell my sorta neat Mr. Bungle story.

When I was a sophomore in college (95/96) my friends and I met a really cool guy who was older than us but was in the same bachelors program.  It came up at some party that we really loved Mr. Bungle and he said, "oh yeah, I used to live with Mike Patton in San Francisco".  He went on to say that they used to drop acid and finger paint on the walls...the rest of the details are fuzzy and I could have the city wrong but that's how I remember it, but he went on to say, that he had an original Mr. Bungle demo tape and he'd let us have it, or borrow it or whatever.

We sort of thought he was full of it but sure enough, he showed up to class with this Maxwell cassette tape for an old 8 track mixer or whatever they are called and it had a crazy photocopied cover.  We about creamed our pants.  We used to listen to it all the time but the tape disappeared at some point that year and the only thing I can remember from it was that Mike Patton started out the recording with something like...this is "MR. BUNGLE, DEMO number (whatever) bringing you 8 tracks of mother fucking" ...something...hell I can't remember, it was about 20 years ago.

in any event, being a college kid, 19/20 years old in the Midwest, that was really cool, to get sort of a peak into the past of Mr. Bungle.  Ah the good ole days before youtube lol.

/not very exciting to anyone but me I suppose.

<TEXT> Oh its not that bad and obviously if the place was going to fall down and the city wouldn't let them do anything, then ok, I can understand.  Most articles of late are how they should tear down Wrigley to increase revenue and I think they've lost sight of what baseball is to a lot of us.  I've been to many modern ball parks and I hate them.  Loud blaring music, giant jumbo-tron with guess which hat the baseball is under, etc.  I love Wrigley and the atmosphere and I think it's incredibly important to who the Cubs are.  It's my opinion and stated from the start I'm probably in the minority. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you!  If they tear down Wrigley or move the Cubs, I'm done.  My grandparents took me to games there, I took my kids to games there.  My family going back to my great grandfather have a lot of memories in the place and is why I'm still a fan despite the decades of pain.  Yes I want them to win, a new stadium, at least in my eyes, is the least of their concerns.  However I do support the upgrading of the facilities and so forth and I hope they can find the right solution that does't impact the beauty of the park.

I realize some people don't care and perhaps I'm in the minority but there are some things in baseball that need to stay and I hope Wrigley is still there for my grand kids to enjoy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was an available lot we liked for building our new home.  We saw it a few times and decided to have the builder come look at it.  He liked it as well so we began discussing some potential ideas just when the neighbors adjacent to the property let their giant barking dog out to go to the bathroom.  We all smiled and climbed in our cars and left.

Basically, as some probably have said, visit the home/site several times during different time periods morning/noon/evening/later at night.  Sit in your car with the windows down for a while.  Look at traffic, listen for dogs, maybe there is a loud church/school bell or distant train horn that will disturb your sleep or be bothersome.  Maybe the neighbor gets off work and likes to jam with his death metal band or his daughter is learning the saxophone and never stops playing.  Anything you can think of that may be bothersome over time or will affect your ability to sell the house later on.

When we bought our first home it was about 15 miles from a fairly small airport.  We were not on the flight path and never heard a single commercial flight coming in or out of the airport and trust me, we tried.  We later found out after purchasing our home that one weekend a month, the local Airforce reserve practiced their take offs/landings and fly circles over the airport.  This brought them directly over our home, for 48 hours in a row, once a month...loud refueling planes.

We got used to it but it wasn't something we anticipated.  Best of luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I ran into this as a seller 3 months ago.  Our neighbors fence encroached by 1 1/4" but only starting at the last 1/3 of the fence.  So only 1/3 encroached and at its most extreme was 1 1/4".

http://imgur.com/y5kVFPO

That is the survey marker and the fence post.  The potential buyer wouldn't purchase without a clean survey and this was our first offer after nearly a year on the market.  Even the survey guy was in shock that they cared such a slight encroachment.  

I discussed it with my neighbor and offered to pay for any supplies and I'd even do the work myself.  In the end it cost me a case of beer and a $50 gift card to a nice restaurant as a thank you.  He did all the work and it took him about 6 hours to move 4 fence posts.  He only moved it just enough and it was so close I think the survey guy let it slide.

I tried to be a good neighbor and hopefully I was.  If I was in his same shoes I'd hope to respond in a similar fashion.

Ultimately these are going to be people you have to live with so either choose to handle this in a way to keep peace or I'd look elsewhere.  If you are going to look out your window every day and think about that fence, it's not worth it or if you think it will affect the potential sale of your home, then move on.  Best of luck, it's a challenging situation and I don't understand why people wouldn't get a survey (cheap I guess) and second wouldn't build with at least 2 feet buffer to avoid crazy issues like this.

...just realized after typing this all out that your post is a month old...anyway, I hope everything worked out for you. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yesterday was my 37th Birthday.  July 19th will be my TEN year wedding anniversary.  I am originally from near Chicago, even lived there for a while after college.  Grew up a huge Cubs fan and when I go to Wrigley it's almost a religious experience for me.  It's my connection to family who have passed on and all the fans who came long before me.  I felt the stars may have been aligned and I would get the rare opportunity to see my favorite band play at my favorite venue for a once in a life time experience.   I'm grateful that some of you were lucky to get tickets and sort of kicking myself for not being in the TEN Club.  With three kids and mortgage, it's hard to justify the expense when it comes down to it. Every penny counts you know.

Pearl Jam has been "my band" since I was 15/16 years old.  Living in the Midwest, I've only been able to see them one time and even then I had to travel 10 hours.  I got to see Brad once at the Ranch Bowl (RIP) in Omaha.  There were 7 of us at that show, total, and it was an amazing experience that will live with me forever.  I got to hang out with Stone at Perkins while the band waited for their food.  I sat there for a while and asked awkward questions because I was too star struck to hardly speak.

I have every cassette, cd, vinyl.  I have posters and bootlegs and t-shirts.  The band saved me during difficult times and opened me up to a world of music, friends, ideas that helped shaped who I am today.  I am a die hard fan in every sense of the word and to the extent I could afford over the years.

What frustrates me is that there are thousands of fans just like me who would do about anything to be at this show.  I've busted my ass the last 10 years to be a good husband and father and we are finally at a point where opportunities like this are an option for us.  To celebrate our anniversary, watching the band that changed my life, with the woman who changed my life, would have meant so much to me.

Yesterday, I try all i can to get tickets as do my friends spread across the country.  Swapping texts of encouragement, holding our breath after each agonizing, 30 second countdown completes.  I know one person whose a friend of someone who got 4 tickets, all spoken for.  I had tears in my eyes when "this event is sold out" appeared on my screen.

I go online today, hundreds and hundreds of tickets for up to $2300 on several ticket broker sites.  Literally breaks my heart.

There is no one at fault, no one to blame, its just the way of the world today.  It's just sad that so many people who truly deserve to be there, probably even more than me, won't get to.  Its disappointing that despite their best effort, "my band" couldn't protect us from the scourge of ticket brokers (lets call them scalpers, that's what they really are).

It's not the end of the world, life will go on.  I've been very fortunate and have an incredible family.  Just had to vent a little this morning after spending weeeeeeks dreaming of the opportunity to go.  As I explained to my wife when the concert was first announced, this was my dream concert, One of those far fetched, what-if scenerios discussed on a long road trip in college, I'd never had imagine would actually take place.

If you were able to get tickets, congrats and I hope you have an incredible time.  I'm probably still heading to Chicago and you'll probably see me standing outside enjoying the tunes anyway.

tl;dr, I'm a big whiny baby who didn't get tickets but hope that many of you did.  :)  Thank you for letting me vent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this was so long ago, I was just saying I enjoyed the multiplayer and I remember, as the OP said, them patching it and it then wasn't fun.  Outside that, its pretty foggy, since then I've gotten married, had 3 kids, etc, I just remember it being fun.  I wasn't hardcore or anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if you played it, it doesn't sound like it is the case. The point of capture the flag was to obviously capture the flag and at the start of each round, you could choose 2 force skills from a whole list of them and if used properly, no matter which combination, you could gain an advantage.  That was the point.  Running across a bridge, seeing another coming towards you, blocking their saber toss, then choke and toss them off the edge.  Or power jump over them and saber toss into their back, etc.  It was a lot of fun to play at the time and I think somehow you have misunderstood how the game was played.  I guess I don't get the point you are making about playing a game and not using all tools at your disposal.  I had fond, fun memories playing and I can assure you that's how everyone played the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this!  With enough practice you could dominate with force choke then force push.  It was incredibly fun if you put the effort in...then they patched it to oblivion and I haven't played it since.  Completely forgot about how much fun that was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a very close friend who is the complete opposite of myself and we rarely discuss politics/religion/etc because its not worth it.  We had a similar conversation when the new health care bill was being debated.  

  One of our co-workers brought it up out of curiosity, she is from India and was commenting on how she couldn't believe how much it costs to go to the doctor here in the US.  In India, even someone who is poor and living on the street can see a doctor for free.  My friend remarked that in America, we shouldn't be responsible for others NOT being responsible.  

  I asked if it was someone who had always been responsible, always paid their taxes, good citizen, etc. lost their job and had to choose between paying for Cobra and paying rent/mortgage and chose to let their insurance lapse to survive...then had a life threatening situation like cancer, should they be denied coverage and have to pay the full amount of their care?  Shouldn't we find a way to help them?

His response was, "well, he should of had insurance and it's not our fault he did not."

I asked, "so, not under any circumstance, would you allow him to get healthcare coverage?"

He said, "he should have been better prepared."

I asked, "so is that how you will explain it to Jesus when you get to heaven?"

He said, "Jesus taught people to be responsible for themselves."

ah ok, thanks for clearing that up.

I'm always trying to understand how many "religious" people don't see the huge conflict between their political and religious "beliefs".  

Anyway, sorry to ramble thanks for sharing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suffer from these, for over thirty years now, contracted as a child in the hospital from some awesome person who didn't wash their hands.  My first outbreak covered the entire left side of my face when I was in second grade.  

I used to get a "normal" outbreak a dozen times a year, always in the same area.  I've had two additional outbreaks that were large and covered big sections of my face.  As I've gotten older, I seem to have outbreaks less often, maybe once or twice a year now.

I completely sympathize with how it makes you feel.  I truly hate it, especially that tingling I get when I know its about to surface.  I just feel crummy altogether...its indescribable.

I used Abreva when it first came on the market and for me, it made it spread.  The small outbreaks used to only occur on the corner of my mouth.  Once I used Abreva it spread to to the corner and the side of one nostril.  I'll get it there on occasion now.  That may not be the case for everyone but it was for me and I'm too afraid to try it again.

Funny enough I use Carmex and if I begin to apply it right as I feel the tingle, it will either not show up or be rather small and only last a week at the most.  I keep it within reach at the house, in my desk drawer and in my backpack. Any trip away from home I have it with me, usually several containers to be safe.  It's probably just a placebo affect but I'm pleased with the results.

I've been prescribed meds, both oral and topical, previously but they didn't make a difference for me.  That was some time ago so I may revisit that in the future.

I'm most nervous that when I get old and crust, my kids will ship me off to an old folks home and then I'll have an outbreak and it won't be treated properly...how sad is that.  :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> We "cut the cord" years ago and if you still want to have cable internet service you can use Internet Nebraska.  If you use them you will also get "ESPN3" (or whatever its called now) so you can catch the ESPN broadcasts online.  If you have a Xbox 360 you can use the ESPN channel on there with that too.

We use an antenna for over the air, netflix, hulu, I subscribe to MLB TV for my baseball fix (can watch baseball on my roku or xbox in HD) and use ESPN3 for anything else.  If I have to I can hit the bar of a friends house for a Husker game airing on any other station.
It took us about 6 months to get used to but then you seriously won't want to go back.  My wife through a fit when we did this change and recently I asked if we should consider going back and she said "no way, never"! </TEXT>

<TEXT> What Dell was saying in your article is they are shifting their focus to enterprise, not only focusing on the existing PC market.  Here is a quote from Dell in the article you are citing: "Anderson said that the company would continue to invest in PCs, citing the success of its premium XPS line of consumer laptops and desktops."

HP specifically stated they were considering spinning off or selling their PC business.

"HP today announced that its board of directors has authorized the evaluation of strategic alternatives for its Personal Systems Group (PSG), including the exploration of the separation of its PC business into a separate company through a spin-off or other transaction."

http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/110818xb.html

======

What Dell was getting at is they are going to focus on enterprise solutions to offer with their hardware solutions.  If you look at their acquisitions over the last 3 years you will understand they have focused on that strategy and want to be thought of as more than a PC maker but a solutions provider.

Key Acquistions:

* Perot Systems (now Dell Services)
* Secureworks
* SonicWall
* Wyse
* AppAssure
* Quest migration software
* Force 10
* Compellent
* many more...

They've used one of those acquisitions to build Dell Cloud Services as well.  This is why they are trying to emphasize the focus on more than PCs...not that they are leaving the PC business. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nebraska leads the nation in Academic All-Americans:  [link] (http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205821488 DB_OEM_ID=100).

College Football as ranked by academics: [link](http://higheredwatch.newamerica.net/blogposts/2012/the_2012_academic_bowl_championship_series-75177).

The only reason we were removed from the AAU is because our Medical Center is under a different administrative umbrella so it's research dollars do not count towards the AAU requirements and a large portion of our grants go towards Ag and so a large chunk of that amount also does not count towards the grant dollars total.  We are a small school and it wasn't academic based, it was research dollar totals based upon some crazy requirements.

Just a silly uniformed statement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am just as mad/sad/angry/pissed/depressed/etc as the rest of the fans.  As an Alumni and a citizen of Lincoln I want our team to be great on and off the field.  I don't measure great by number of wins as much as I do the quality of the student athletes and how they look on the field of play.

Coach Bo has succeeded at the off the field and in the classroom aspect.  I also think he is a kind and loyal friend.

In order to take things to the next level, he needs a new O Line coach and a new D coordinator.  Just my opinion, and I could certainly be wrong.  I also think our offensive coordinator has bad games but I believe he will improve.  (Offense can control the tempo and they failed to do that at all on Saturday...everyone knows the weakness of the Wisconsin offense but we often tried to run it up the middle instead or three quick throws...terrible play calling at critical times.)

We also need to evaluate our special teams coaching and reinforce ball security as a major focal point this off season.

I don't want Bo to leave, as far as I know he's a good coach, good person and a good leader.  He just needs to realize this isn't Coaching U, and although the staff is a great bunch of folks, we just aren't improving as would be expected.  We don't have time for a 34 year old to learn on the job.  

I don't mind losing...by 3 or 7...this is football, it happens all over the country, every week...but losing by 40...just inexcusable...when that happens, something has to change, somewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our two biggest challenges with families and holidays are:

-They serve "the meal" at odd times, like at 7 or 8 pm.  This may be fine when you are just dinning with adults but children, especially small ones, don't adapt well and it causes them to get fussy and act up when they may not normally.  If you give them a snack to tied them over, then they may not eat at the meal...which elicits comments.

-They like to give the kids a lot of junk food, soda pop and ask us to let them stay up, all because they don't get to see them often, then comment on how they are misbehaving the next day, all directly related to these factors.

but you roll with the punches because life's too short. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a Husker fan I did want to tell the Penn State fans that holy crap, your team looked great, disciplined and I think you have a really special coach.  I have a good friend who is a Penn State Alum and I know many folks were not happy about O'Brien at first, but, he's going to do great things.  

I'd rather not have any "controversial" calls or injured star players because then "your team really didn't win"....but teams can only play with those around them and we certainly don't have any influence on the refs, especially when Bo is screaming at them most of the time.

A lot of Husker fans point to the 1 second put back on against Texas in the Big 12 Championship in 2009 and scream conspiracy but they often forget that the drive started with a kick off out of bounds and if memory serves, a penalty at some point.  Remove those two things and they aren't in field goal range and the 1 second may become meaningless and Nebraska wins...or Texas could have scored on a hail mary...who knows.  It's part of what makes any sport exciting and frustrating and I'm sorry that it didn't go your way.  I think it was a TD as do all fans I have discussed it with...there was 8 minutes left so who knows what would have happened...it wasn't a TD with 1 second left sort of situation.

In any event, before this game, I think on a league and national level the Nebraska vs Penn State "rivalry" seemed forced and now it has a purpose and will be a fun to watch for years to come.  

Best of luck on the rest of your season. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a superb question but it came out in 2003...and to be honest I don't remember enough to answer that thoroughly.  What I remember was a great story and I loved managing the squad.  It was one of those games that really stood out to me and like a great book, I was sad to see it come to an end.  

I've been playing games since the early 80's when my dad bought an Atari at Sears and there will be certain games that will stand out in my mind as something special, and to me, this was one of those.  I'm about to move in a week and perhaps I'll come across it.  If I do, I fire it up and see how it stands 9 years later. </TEXT>

-Portal/Portal 2...if they are smart and like to solve puzzles, they both love this game and they think it's funny.
-Sam   Max games...good adventure games and you can catch them on steam sales all the time
-Angry Birds...I think you can still get that free through the Chrome web browser store...kids are crazy for this game, I guess everyone was at some point.
-King Arthur's Gold.  Its like Terraria, sorta...its more online, red vs blue, building and defending.  My son loves it and it's also prob my favorite game right now and has been for the last 6 mo or more...and im playing XCOM, Dishonored, NS2, GW2 and PS2.

That's what my 9 year old likes right now...if you asked me to pick 1 single game, I'd recommend Portal 2 b/c they can build new levels which can be incredibly rewarding for them as well.  If I think of something else, I'll update here.

<TEXT> ....Valve...*tear drops*...I love Valve...congrats on that, that's great.  I used to do mod work back in HL 1 days.  Our little group of level designers ended up creating quite a few official DOD maps. A few from our group went on and did some work for Valve as well as my buddy "Waldo".   I also did stuff for countless other mods, released and unreleased.  

There used to be another level designer from Lincoln who did stuff for the NS1 mod and did some work for 4D rulers when they were still around, not sure if that's you or you knew him...I think he went by Squirrel something...something...can't remember anymore...not important.

I credit Valve for my current career path.  I wanted to play Team Fortress Classic so bad so I built my first computer which led to a tech bench job.  12 years later and a ton of hard work and I'm in a high skill IT job.  I wouldn't have discovered my passion for this field if it wasn't for starring at the back of the HL box and wanting to play TFC.  That journey began just after receiving my arts degree from UNL so quite a shift.

I believe the business model created by Gabe and Co and the ultimate results were monumental to the gaming world.  How they cultivated and supported the mod community, often gave them work later on...and don't forget Steam which has changed gaming forever.

If any event, if you see Gabe, tell him big thanks for me.  Also, a strange request.  I have been trying to put together a (sort of) sleeve for a tattoo and was actually going to write Gabe about this.  I saw in some pictures in the Valve lobby that there is a glass wall with lots of tiny icons/logos/symbols or whatever and was wondering if they had close up pictures of that.  I thought it would be neat concept to incorporate into some of the items I already want to use.  

Ok...well...I've gone on long enough.  Maybe next time I come to Seattle you can help me apply for an official tour.  :)  Take care! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did find it interesting and surprising that they endorsed Obama, as they had endorsed McCain 4 years ago.  What was more surprising was all the outrage and threats to cancel a paper subscription because of this.  What is the point of reading/listening/watching only sources of information you agree with.  All along, these readers spent money supporting the paper and must have agreed with most of what they said up to this point.  Now that the editors have come to a consensus on who the believe would be the best choice of the two candidates, which some readers do not agree with, they get all butt hurt?  If it was the other way around, they'd be sharing it on Facebook and high five-ing correct?  I guess I don't understand why the one conclusion is given more weight then another.  It's really just a few people's opinions.  Take from it what you can and move on, right?

Additional endorsements that caught my attention and likely caused a little backlash:

Winstom-Salem Journal endorses Obama, first Democrat since 1964.
