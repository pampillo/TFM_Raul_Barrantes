<TEXT> The "XD" screens at Cinemark by Fayette Mall are pretty good... Bigger and louder than the standard screens there. That is also one of the newer/busier theaters in town so if anyone dresses up they'd probably go there. Just make sure you buy your ticket for one of the "XD" showings  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a tiny playground on the corner of Francis and Burley Ave behind the Rally's on Broadway. They've been tearing down old buildings back there and putting in cheap student housing. It has a basketball court and a few play structures... I cut through there to avoid traffic sometimes and have never seen anyone but college kids playing basketball.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Boot's Auto Body has done lots of work for my family over the years. My parents don't even bother getting estimates anywhere else, as they insurance and have been very pleased with the work done there. 

Most car guys in town will say that The Lab on Versailles Rd does the absolute best work, but you pay for it. I took a motorcycle there for a paint estimate once and it was double what I expected. The shop was full of classic muscle cars and high end imports, so I guess that says something.

<TEXT> I stumbled across this film while browsing my parents' "premium" channels when I was in middle school, and have been searching for it ever since. I remember it being a fairly hokey 90's-ish drama. The main character was a writer who is a witness in some sort of criminal court case.

I remember a specific scene where he is on the stand giving testimony about a crime he witnessed, and describes the defendant. The defense attorney scoffs at him, suggesting that no one's memory is that good. In an attempt discredit the him, the attorney turns around then asks him what color shirt and tie he has on. The main character proceeds to describe, Sherlock Holmes-style, the attorney's entire outfit, even commenting on the style of tie knot. He then smugly says that he can do this because he is a writer, or something dumb. He was kind of a douche.

Anyway he has sex with his wife and also has an affair and these were the most memorable/exquisite four boobs of my young life and they have eluded me for nearly two decades.

<TEXT> You are most likely seeing these. You can tell by a little white band on each antennae. I was told by an exterminator that they are invasive and new in town; supposedly they are trying to get into your walls before it gets cold, then kind of stumble into your place throughout the winter. I only had to flush about one a week last year. Not terrible. </TEXT>
