<TEXT> I had a pretty dark addiction to alcohol in my 20's and 30's, didn't stop for good until 41. I'm 43, 2 years off the bottle, and thank the good Lord AA and a good diet helped me.

Do I still think about a beer every now and then? Absolutely. However, I know one leads to 30, which is when my thoughts click off.

I am all about reform, I just don't think putting hypodermic needles in a Coke machine is the solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> FYI, if we're speaking semantically, Google was essentially a cheaply funded college project. WE (the ones in dire need of a search engine solution) helped it grow into a multi-billion dollar dynasty by virtue of interest, usage and advertising revenue.

But again, whatever.

*" The wage gap is due to the fact that women tend to gravitate towards careers that pay lower than the careers that men gravitate towards"* - I can't believe I just read something so shallow.

Please, oh please, show me an example of how MORE WOMEN (knowing that men outnumber women in the workforce) gravitate towards McDonalds, Subway, call centers and other similarly low-paying jobs.

Please, do tell me how women gravitate towards $10-$14 CNA jobs while men do the $8-13 maintenance/laundry jobs in THE SAME FACILITY.

Show us how many male strippers make $1000's a week.
Or, better yet, show me an example where sex appeal has gotten men a raise...perhaps that's the end of the steak we should be cutting from, since you seem to think that women pleading with their employer for equal pay is 'sexist mythos'.

Geesh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed.

I think today's breed of journalists produce what I'd like to call 'vitriolic pablum'. Unverified, bland 'pap'. It's a race to see who can get their mega-blog to the top of Google, reap the most Adsense dollars, and fundamentally establish themselves in a social sphere that seems to love 'regurgitated literature'.

A few months ago, I approached Forbes with several wonderful pieces that would add an interesting dynamic to their entrepreneurial audience. Wouldn't you know it - I found the *very idea they rejected* on some staff writer's Forbes blog.

And they wonder why Arianna Huffington got out of the game... </TEXT>

That's what gets me about Slate. They want you to support their snarky, heavily opinionated (yet invalidated) journalism by paying for articles behind their S+ paywall, yet have yet to prove the work they're 'selling' is worth a piss. It's mainly conjecture mixed with comedic overtones.

For a second there, I actually read what you said and thought, 'man, this person knows Politico'. And for a full minute, I actually gave two fucks.

The glory is gone. As is the notion Politico is any more or less fulfilling than any other click bait political site. Breitbart may be unconventional in its own right, but whatever. It's a site. I support neither site fully. I support free journalism which means anyone with an idea should be allowed to share it, even if that means breaking molds or having people contest their viewpoints.

So take your exaggerations, pedantic ruses and whatever else you're trying to get out of this discussion and click on over to something else - maybe /r/nottheonion is more your speed since it appears you've mastered irrelevant commentary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right you are.

One thing I'd like to add is the fact that dreams will vary by definition. For example, I wanted a simple house (got it) paid in full before I'm 50 (almost there), and to own a Bentley GTZ (nowhere close yet). The next person, however, would envision an American dream being somewhat simpler - home, kids, husband, dog. 

Any dream, whether it's Icelandic, Swiss or American, is each person's to *own*. No government can take that from you, unless your dream involves necessary freedoms that are being infringed or taken away completely. </TEXT>

See my point here?

Your point would have been valid, umm, never. The earth's populace doesn't just stop creating sexist people - changes in belief systems alter sexist beliefs, not a sudden shortage of old white folks (which, consequently, get replaced with younger white dudes with the same mentality). </TEXT>

However, maybe it's time the good people in Mexico grab bats, knives, guns, rocks or whatever they have and take their country back. A good 'ol purging. </TEXT>

Will it keep individuals from coming into America? For awhile, until Trump figures out he's pretty fucking lame for forgetting the fact people can take a boat and either enter through California, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama or wherever there's no wall.

Do I believe the undocumented workers trying to better themselves should be banished? No, I do believe they should be given 'x' amount of time to take a citizenship test and obtain papers, however...that's fair.

Do I believe undocumented residents who are committing felonies and flooding our jails/communities with drugs should be banished? Absolutely - they are not contributing anything to our society.

Trump doesn't know politics, but knows business. He will eventually meld the two together and make his four-year term work for everyone involved. </TEXT>

The Mexican stock market will probably hit some lows before rallying, my friend. Consider everything going on right now:

--threats regarding trade
--a fictitious wall
--immigration (which could flood Mexico with more mouths to feed than jobs to feed them)
--cartels (who, although are roughnecks, do take care of their communities) getting broken up

These all add both mitigating and aggravating factors to the peso's stability. </TEXT>

With that in mind, Marine decided to Tweet pictures of horrific acts related to a very real worldwide struggle. Do I think she should be charged criminally? Abso-fucking-lutely. That's like giving a ISIS car bomber the keys to a fucking Ferrari and begging them to blow up an embassy. </TEXT>

You can, in fact, be prosecuted for posting offensively online, albeit civilly. 

You can own a gun provided you have no violent crimes, (even if those crimes aren't gun-related) and are deemed mentally sound enough to use it responsibly.

Freedom of speech? To a point. Telling cops 'fuck you' was only recently decriminalized.

<TEXT> I condemn any religious activity, present-day eschatological psychobabble or bullshit speech that takes away from what religion is designed for.

World news and astrological viewpoints seem to fall parallel on many news outlets (if you read them). So fucking what. 

Religion and recruiting forces have been bedfellows since Napoleon fucking Bonaparte. And they'll be buttfucking each other long after our existences. 

It's fucking news. It's entertainment. Call it what you want, or don't call it anything. </TEXT>
