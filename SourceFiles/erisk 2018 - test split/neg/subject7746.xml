<TEXT> I figured as much. Because the tactical voting as your example indicates may happen but without knowing how much disillusionment you can't put it into a model. Also, a lot of behaviors those voting are recursive.

By that I mean you are a die hard (or even probably just agree with his sentiment) Bernie voter, for example.

So many possibilities exist to bucket this person in that it's just too much work really. You could make an argument that he - who would vote for D - may vote for A, B, or C.

However, A (Trump) or B (Hillary) both represent something completely different from what you want, and C (third party) is dangerous. Tactical voting may be more powerful but at what cost? You can put them in as many as 4 buckets. Then what? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What exactly is honest voting defined as?

Also...


Let's say you have a spectrum of 100 people (for now without party affiliation) - on one end low income, low education, and on the other high income, post-graduate education. Is there a model that would account for the voting patterns of this group? And maybe repeat it 500,000 times to model a general election?


Then you would add a variable to include party affiliation, same 100 people but every so often randomize all 100 to be either Democrat or Republican.


Finally, assume you're in different states where you have a variety of demographic factors. So the spectrum skews low or high occasionally.


What do you think would happen? Would these findings be valuable? </TEXT>

<TITLE> MCOC is really turning into WoW </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-03 17:08:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Due to challenger rating I wrote this up:

tl;dr - MCOC is now WoW in terms of design philosophy.

I'm guessing they are going to WoW raid/dungeon boss route.

Usually you capped at 60/70/80/etc depending on expansion, end game dungeon bosses were +2 levels higher and raid bosses were +3 levels, compared to cap.

You had to gear for them, you needed 8-10% additional hit chance to never miss special attacks on dungeon bosses, but you never needed to always hit.

But raid bosses required about 15% additional hit chance to never miss with abilities, including things like Taunt for tanking. And for entry level raiders, this was impossible without sacrificing some other stats. However, in OVERGEARED (4\* 5/50+or  5\* 3/45+ in MCOC) content meaning using gear from later raids, doing these encounters became trivial as your stats were so much better compared to what was needed to survive and do consistent damage. Or at least that's the intention.

Dungeon/questing can be described as this:

Beginner/Normal is like early game content in WoW. Simple and easy to learn the fights without them being overly aggressive.

Heroic is a bit more challenging and like higher level dungeons, without too many additional mechanics. You need some level of gear in WoW to do high level dungeons, but you can get away with reasonably high gear near cap level.

Master mode is like Heroic Dungeons in WoW - first time difficult, but eventually manageable and supposed to introduce/tease you to Raid level difficulties. Some of the MCOC fights, especially Road to Labyrinth, train you on length of fights or avoiding damage.

RoL and LoL are meant to be equivalent to Heroic and higher Raid difficulty - with bosses potentially instakilling you unless you had the strats down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember the days when I played WoW.

We had gear that added % additive to crit.

After the first expansion, it was changed to adding to flat values (ratings), but based on level.

Example:
14 crit rating for 1% additional crit chance at level 60.

Turned into 22 crit rating required for 1% crit chance at level 70.

I just hope that the crit rating for crit % stays constant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't want to continue this, but as an Asian American growing up in the 90s, I've felt massive amounts of racism. That said, I've grown thick skin and now relish a time where there's considerably more inclusion than when I was most vulnerable in my childhood. I will never forget it though.

However, back to the point, I'll buy whatever I want to buy. There's too much interconnectivity in the world not to indirectly support something I can't do on principle. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-29 18:14:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking - assuming it's Infinity Thanos - he would start with a high amount of health, like 1.5m.

From full health to 90% health remaining, he would do his Act 3 move set with more damage.

At 90% he would gain additional effects to his move set (like degen, poison, or power burn) as well as gain random status effects like Venom in addition to ones that cycle like DS.

At 30% remaining he can use Sp1 without any energy cost, but Sp2 would still use 2 bars energy. Also, he stops gaining status effects except the one he had at that point in time.

Finally, a killing blow puts Thanos in an undying mode like Punisher for 30 seconds, but he gains lifesteal like DS where he heals for a % of damage done as well as unstoppable like Juggs. It's possible for him to heal too much to kill in one final attempt without technical skill and parry precision.

There's a unique strategy in each phase. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's interesting you posted that article and not this one: www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2017/01/23/dispelling-the-myth-of-underemployed-college-graduates/#4976028c4084

Now I read the article and I think the author has the wrong view. Also, he's still using unemployment - which is the most gameable stat out there.

Also, I think we moved too much out of labor and production into service industries in the past several decades. It has been said more workers of all kinds are needed to support those labor and production activities. </TEXT>

Edit: a big theme in Born to Run is diet. Especially as the author slimmed down and as he examined early human anthropology.


Before you start running longer distances, change your diet to slim down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recreational runner here, in case he doesn't answer.

I got into running because I was looking for a cheap exercise activity - mainly cardio. I read several books about the mechanics and philosophy of running but at the end of the day, I just ran. I joined several different running groups and events and it just went uphill and downhill from there.

Highly recommend Born to Run by Christopher McDougall. It basically tells why running is inherently "interesting" to us as a species. </TEXT>

He is now the skill version of SW/SL.

When using abilities his arrows have a chance (increased by sig level) to cause effects based on opponent class:

- Mutant: power drain

- Science: bleed/degen

- Skill: weakness

- Tech: armor break

- Cosmic: Iron fist style remove 1 precision/cruelty/fury effect

Instead of increasing your own power gain or decreasing opponent's, increase your own damage or decrease damage taken.

<TEXT> I guess you don't know much about comic Doom?

If you're like many other MCU viewers, Doom is this weird bad guy that's shown up in all of the F4 movies. But his story is poorly written and contrived in those films. Marvel has had that issue with one-off bad guys it seems.

This would be a great intro to Doom as he is, initially comparing him to a real life target but slowly developing him to his real comic roots. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Crazy Idea for MCU </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-14 17:04:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To provide satire and commentary on latest US (and other populist) elections, MCU could get away with having Doom as a rising leader of Sokovia.

Edit: it seems people are misunderstanding. I don't intend to fully project Trump on Doom. I mean to use his election or selection as leader in the same way. He promises change and recovery and personally vows to fight the Avengers and other powers who've abused Sokovia. This would be a good intro without much exposition.

He would be an anti-villain, a lawful evil type that wants nothing but good for Sokovia and would ally with Zemo, who is not part of Hydra per se in MCU. Doom would be isolationist and protectionist while fighting the Avengers only when they encroach on Sokovia or allied lands.


Also,

"Stark, do you not remember what your faceless machines of death did to my people and lands? Instead, my guardians will share in my likeness!"

Currently driving a WRX, but going to commute in city/state route roads.

Need a fuel efficient, snow driving capable car.

**Bonus:**

Maybe mid to late 90s for upfront cost savings, with expectation that repair costs aren't massive. Pref not an SUV, but will consider a wagon or hatch. FWD, AWD preferred.

Auto transmission is better, mostly because I don't know manual. (Want to learn one day) </TEXT>

Honestly, I would prefer two other bankers:

- Christopher Flowers, organizer of Bear Stearns's emergency funding; smart dude, very calculating, also no visible relationship with Clintons </TEXT>

<TEXT> This makes sense though - without a foothold in the US, a foreign investment bank would need to acquire a US bank.

Usually, they acquire the cheapest names and rebrand them as their own. They acquired Bankers Trust, which had some issues with derivatives in the 90s, to expand US operations.

One notable example against this was Credit Suisse and First Boston. First Boston was a relative powerhouse in the 80s, so it made sense to acquire them. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Halloween Contests are Overrated (Halloween 2016) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-26 22:00:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You know the ones Im talking about. A bunch of people meet up somewhere like a library or a mansion, and they coo and fawn over each others costumes. Then one guy  totally impartial, by the way  judges everyone. Someone wins a gift certificate at a restaurant or some free souvenirs with the sponsors name on it. Yea, those contests 

Well, they suck and Im going to show them how bad they are by winning with the worlds worst costume.

First things first, people think awesome costumes take the longest to make and prepare, but it really takes a lot of planning to make the worlds worst costume. I went down the list of possibilities: bad puns (Malware-wolf, portrait-geist), ridiculously unsexy costumes (fat, balding dude in a cheerleader costume), horribly mashed up costumes, etc. Eventually, I had a great idea and I was going to go with it.

I found an ad for a secret party on the outskirts of town. The best part is the prize was cash ($1,000)  this was clearly some rich dude trying give away free money. So I put on my costume, which surprisingly took a while, and headed off to this house in the woods.

The area was spooky enough and the mansion was *huge*. I hadnt really come out here before, and this place amazed me to no end just how spacious the grounds were. The butler  at least, I think he was  let us in and showed us the way to the ballroom (*just a really open space with weird art and ornate walls*). 

Once in the ballroom, the other guests and I had a chance to meet and mingle. The costumes were all generic or uninspired: I saw 2 people as vampires, half a dozen people were zombies of varying stages in decomposition, one guy was a some generic-looking slasher movie character (I call myself the Springville Slayer *brandishes scythe* Me: *sigh*). My plan worked, though  people couldnt comprehend nor understand my costume; I heard a lot of whispering and mumbling about me.

The host arrived, entering on the second story landing of the room. Oddly, there were no stairs inside the room leading up, as you would see in the movies.

Welcome to my party  I see everyone dressed up in their own magnificent (*What?*) ideas and imagination.

Guests murmured.

Unfortunately, there will be no winners. Nyarlathotep shugg ngathg nnnehye shugg, lloig h'fm'latgh naflebunma. Good luck, and let the games begin.

*Great, we have an Old God nutter.* He's going to sacrifice everyone to the Old ones.

I watched as the entire room descended into madness, as people became their costumes. The vampire and one of the zombies began wrestling, trying to consume one another. One of the killer clowns was stabbing a sexy nurse, who was garroting a werewolf with her stethoscope. The Springville Slayer was slaying the horde of zombies with his scythe.

Me, on the other hand I was going to make America great again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bet you someone at Marvel thought of this. Thematically and logically it is very confusing to audiences: is TAO an alien or a God figure? Is there one or many? Then you ask: who is going to be inside the costume? How will audiences relate to him/her?

Then from a money standpoint, what's least expensive? Well, this might cost less from a personnel standpoint, but then postproduction it adds a layer of cost with tons of dubbing and VAs.

Also, to the average audience, a RP British accent sounds regal and wise and imposing. Which is why the many voices idea wouldn't work. You don't want a skater bro type voicing TAO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am Asian btw.

And I think it should be a raceless, faceless being to be honest. To be more specific, I think they shouldn't say who they cast and put a costume on this person the entire time and have many people voice him.

That said, I will look at your suggestions in detail later. </TEXT>

Edit: to be fair, they could've used Keanu Reeves. This is in line with a joke of having Keanu as Doctor Strange (from his AMA).

Edit 2: didn't see it in his AMA, but someone mentioned it on Reddit.

The 5 Speedsters:

- Wally
- E-3 Jay Garrick/Flash
- Jesse
- Eobard (hates not being the one to destroy the world/Flash)
- Savitar (actually [Spoiler](#s Julian, since he hates Barry for not sharing the Speedforce with others like he does))

They go on the beat back ~~Beerus~~ Alchemy enough that he runs away to his home dimension or cannot take physical form. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on the school... My grad school's career services had companies come during peak recruiting cycle of Sep to Dec, for events and talks. It's a top tier school in a major city.

My undergrad was a small public college near same city; the career services was more limited in terms of industries recruiting, but alums would come to hire. I did not take advantage of that, and kicked myself into a MS in something I have not really maximized use of. 

However, the name brand and alum recognition got me into the door at several places, so I am glad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just pointing out one source of Ito's inspirations.

There are different types of horror manga. Most of which are short anthology horror (Fuan no Tane and Fuan no Tane Plus, and the Sky High series). None of the anthology style ones are grotesque, weird and foreboding... they can be a combination of two, but not all three.

then you have action horror like Highschool of the Dead or Apocalypse no Toride or Mahou Shoujo of the End, where the future is bleak but you know the source of the evil (zombies, demons, etc).

You also get minor horror mystery like Another, Tasogare no Otome, or Homunculus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> App Name: WeCam

Developer Name: Acme Inc.

Launched: June 2016



**--- November 2nd, 2016 06:00 ---**

Press Release:

Due to user complaints and related incidents, we have decided to discontinue the app and have refunded users who bought after the promotional period, as incidents have continued to occur, even after removing the problematic filter; the correct number to dial in those instances is (202) 541-3000. Please do not dial customer service  we are still sorting some issues out.

We thank you for your patronage since our launch. We would also like to apologize for the undue emotional distress on our users from any of the tragic occurrences from the use of our app.



**--- November 1st, 2016 01:56 ---**

v1.4.3

Users noted that prolonged usage of the app caused intensity of occurrences and that connecting the app to social media caused the problem to disseminate through the users address book even to users without the app. We have removed the apps ability to connect to other apps, such as Photos and Email, and to PCs and other devices.

Any on-going issues should be reported to the following phone number: (202) 541-3000.



**---October 31st, 2016 22:54---**

v.1.4.2

\*Hotfix\*: We tried to tone down the problematic filter; however, it was not an optimal fix. Testing revealed that the filter still caused the same issue even if settings were dramatically lowered. So we have removed the problematic filter. Any users who cannot download the fix must disconnect their SIM cards as soon as possible.

Our direct line for customer service is (978) 555-0616. Our paranormal experts will help in any way possible.




**---October 31st, 2016 20:43 ---**

v1.4.1

We have received complaints about unusual activities when using our filter. While some were mild in nature, users who visited the sites of violent crimes would report entities being attracted to the device and cause injury and  in some cases - death. For users safety, we recommend that you do not visit these sites.

In addition, weve deployed automatic geotagging so that authorities can find you in case you are lost or something happens to you.



**---October 30th, 2016 18:00 ---**

v1.4.0

OooOooOOohhhh, ready for Halloween? Our latest update has a GhostCam filter. Our paranormal scientists here at Acme Inc. have created a filter using special settings on your cameras lens to find ghostly entities! You can take pictures of spooky and creepy apparitions with your friends while Trick-or-Treating, clubbing, or even watching movies at home! Upload them to Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media app and see how scared your friends and family are.


We have also included other bug fixes and improved the app stability for more smartphone models, so you and more of your friends can join in on the ghostly fun.

<TITLE> [DBZ] which training method would have been effective from more time dilation: Gravity training (1000x and above) or Room of Spirit and Time/Hyperbolic Time Chamber? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-07 18:44:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After the Frieza saga, the Vegeta uses a special gravity chamber that had the ability to go up to 1000x Earth's gravity. Just once though, and train for the Androids.

However, in subsequent trainings to fight Cell and Buu, they use the Hyperbolic Time Chamber in which 1 Earth day on the outside equals 1 Earth year on the inside.


Which method, given that the Saiyans were able to achieve SSJ 2 and above, and thus able to handle 1000x+ earth's gravity, would actually be more impactful at higher levels of gravity in the gravity chamber vs a time chamber?



EDIT: at what point would gravity cause a 365x time dilation?

Edit 2: conceptually this is the perfect /r/asksciencefiction question... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is there a way to keep records of friend messages? Or at least report the ones that are in question?

Hypothetically, someone adds me to call me things like "retarded". For no reason. I calmly defended my position but he resorts to name calling.

Can we implement a "Challenge" system like reporting for out of game messages? By challenge I mean like in NFL. We get 3 chances to challenge (per account). If the message is deemed harassment or name calling, we don't use up a chance. If it is, they get a karma penalty or queue penalty. You use up a challenge, when you report and waste the admin's time. </TEXT>

When I was a kid, my neighbor had a playground with swing set combo. One of the swings was a pogo stick like swing and it had a metal spring inside to help it bounce. I hated the sound... Then I realized I hated reverberation sounds like from plucking a rubber band.

<TITLE> TIFU by pooping at an amusement park </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-22 00:27:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm writing this story because I was gilded earlier this week for this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2w54su/tifu_by_trying_to_get_a_piggyback_ride/conwt6r


A shout out to /u/obscure_renegade for the gold.


Anyway, ten years ago I fucked up.


Some background: my parents are from Taiwan, and they're proud Taiwanese. In the summer of my freshman year at college, I had the opportunity to attend a cultural study tour of the country. This also doubled as a hookup trip - sponsored by the Taiwanese government, no less - since it was all horny Taiwanese American college students. This gave it its nickname: "Love Boat". Now, I want to preface my fuck up by saying every time I go to Taiwan something bad happens. (One time I had an allergic reaction to mosquito bites. Another, I had food poisoning.) I was hoping this trip would not have similar issues.


This trip was 20 days in the capital Taipei and 10 days going around the island. It was a great trip overall. Except for one particular day.


The day in question was the first day outside of Taipei. Our first stop was an amusement park then called Small World Kingdom, now called Window on China in rural Taoyuan county. It's filled with miniature to-scale models of various global landmarks (Leaning Tower of Pisa, Kremlin, Mount Rushmore, etc.). It also has some rides, in the back of the park, accessible only by tram.


And it so happens that I ate something that disagreed with me prior to this park visit. It hit like a world ending asteroid when I was on the tram.


As soon as the tram stopped, a poop dam burst. The levees couldn't hold it back anymore. So, when everyone was headed excitedly to the rides, I ran into the wooded area right next to tram. I hoped I was out of sight as I unloaded on some tropical bush. It took what seemed like an eternity... and I didn't want to take too long as another tram would be coming soon. I grabbed a leaf and wiped.


Of course, it doesn't end there, because shitty water kept trying to come out. So I had to run whilst pulling up my pants to create a vacuum of sorts, as shitty water sprayed out. I made it to an actual restroom where I unloaded even more.


By this time, I was so dehydrated I was woozy. Nevertheless, I had the presence of mind to wash my undies in the bowl after I was done. But to prevent seepage of sorts, I resorted to using toilet paper to create my own makeshift diaper.


It had taken me long enough to evacuate everything that the chaperones of this trip decided that it was time to pack up and head to the next town. Cue my penguin walk of shame to the exit - I hope no one noticed any smell. At the exit, I felt something fall out of my shorts.


I surreptitiously turned back to see a brown, watery toilet paper chunk on the ground being stepped on by dozens of my peers.


tl;dr - I fertilized Taoyuan Valley in Taiwan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are in the process of certifying a finished basement, and we had an electrical inspector come and take a look.


He gave us a list of repairs to be made including 2 outlets above baseboard heaters. Unfortunately, he didn't specify which receptacles to repair. An electrician came to do the repairs, to whom we gave the inspector's findings. 2 receptacles were removed and replaced with blanks.


We found a receptacle that seems suspiciously like it wouldn't be allowed, but we aren't sure. And since the inspector didn't actually specify the offending receptacles, we are worried that he's going to tell us to repair after he inspects again.


I've included 2 images: [one of a relatively safe receptacle](http://imgur.com/TKik38h) near the heater, and [one of the questionable receptacle](http://imgur.com/VqpqOgD). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wasn't sure where to post this and I posted it in/r/talesfromretail, but I feel someone needs to put this out there.


My mom ordered some sneakers from Nike.com on December 29th and Nike sent us an email confirming shipment on January 7th.


My mom did online chat with Nike when the shoes didn't arrive by January 17th. The customer service rep told her that he'd look into it and get back within 3 business days.


The next day my mom received an email saying we had called on January 12th saying that the shoes were wrong size and that we were returning them. WTF? We never got the shoes in the first place. And conveniently, no records exist of the original shipment because the tracking number is invalid.


I've included screenshots of this embarrassment.

<TEXT> Slowly but surely, we are seeing a long game between the two. Sure in this one game there was an outcome...

I pose a thought:
Samaritan is interested in acquiring people, and so is The Machine. But the way the two are doing it is different. So far, we've seen Samaritan find people in a mechanical and calculating way looking for skills they already have.

Meanwhile, I feel the Machine has been a motherly figure nurturing and doing its best to keep everyone alive and grow them beyond their bounds. So I wonder if the Machine has been running simulations on everything beyond today. </TEXT>

2, 350, 90, 65


3, 500, 100, 60



Strategy/Playstyle:


Argellios is a melee warrior who thrives in hand to hand, 1 on 1 duels. He is a force to reckon with in the jungle. He provides little utility in ganking and roaming, however, as his main job is to be a nightmare for the enemy in his own jungle.


His passive Fear the Reaver allows him to shred his enemy's defenses so he and his team do more damage the longer he fights his current target.


His main spell Deathly Skewer is a targeted attack on his current target. The damage increases the weaker the target is. Argellios is therefore good at picking off people who have not returned to base after clearing their jungle or people who are fighting mines.


His second spell Merciless Combo provides filler damage in between basic attacks and Deathly Skewers. It's a small conal area in front of Argellios that hits just like Joule's Thunder Strike, except it provides a mini stun.


Thunderous Roar provides Argellios some utility and once he gets to level 6, avoid invading and/or face checking bushes. He can easily decimate one or two targets -especially if there is a teammate nearby.


Matchups:


Argellios is a particularly painful hero for assassin type champions to deal with. Their lack of durability means that Argellios can destroy them easily. Even other warrior types find him troublesome at first.


Argellios has a hump shaped power curve: he gains power as he levels his Deathly Skewer until 8. At that point he's at his strongest. But as the game progresses, his damage falls off since his damage doesn't scale well into late game. Should focus on building pure tank.


Tanks counter Argellios after they complete some armor and health items. Ranged carries beat him late game as well, due to kiting potential.

Comparable to Pantheon and Darius from LoL. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Krul- A high sustain, attack speed bruiser who can just build tank and be unkillable and do massive damage. Not to mention a strong initiate and catch potential. Only weakness is early game when damage and stacking is slower as well as no cc.

The. I thought basically all melee champions can build tank and still be useful. The meta is undeveloped, or rather underdeveloped, as there isn't much variety yet. No one does %health damage yet (aside from Saw) or have cc prevention or reduction.

Example 2: Glaive if built tank then provides initiation and catch with his Afterburn spell. His damage on his ultimate Bloodsong and Twisted Stroke provide a lot of free damage and sustain as long as he stays alive.


It makes more sense to build tank on Glaive, Krul, Joule, and Catherine at the moment since they have decent base damage and tons of utility in teamfights. </TEXT>

Anyone got tips to prevent this? I mean I play LoL and even then it's hard, and that's with a huge map with many camps. So you can farm somewhat safely away from winning lanes or jungler. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was looking into AAP - and its competitor ORLY - and I noticed a strange pattern in the earnings.


AAP has the reverse cyclicality of ORLY, even though they're in the same sector. AAP tends to have its peak earnings in Q1, which is followed by decreasing NI throughout the year (until the next Q1). Meanwhile, ORLY has steadily increasing NI from Q4 to a peak of NI in Q3 the following year. AZO is similar.


Can anyone explain to me why AAP is reverse to other auto parts suppliers? I thought in general auto parts sellers would follow together. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Home Theater set up suggestions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-11 16:39:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, first time here.


Just a little background: 8 years ago, we had a builder renovate our basement; the plans included a home theater. The alcove is about 20' by 25' and is not entirely enclosed (hence alcove). We got a Bose HTIB installed (Lifestyle 28, series II - if anyone's curious). About 2 years ago, the home theater fell into disuse because of a lack of HD capability from the Bose system. We had been using a WD TV Live starting around the time the home theater started being less useful.


What we need: 


- we have a Sony projector (8 years old) with HDMI, component video, and VGA ports.


- we have a bar which has an old (~4 years old) LCD tv using a coaxial connection with the satellite box. The wire goes through the wall and was put there by the builder.


- we recently got a tv for a treadmill. We use a 35 feet HDMI cable to connect the satellite box directly to the tv.


Other considerations:


- the front left, right, and center cube speakers from the Bose system sit on a AV cabinet/stand about 2' high. meanwhile, the rear left and right cube speakers are mounted on a wall.


tl;dr: We want an AV receiver that can connect our satellite box, dvd player, Wii, and WD TV Live (as well as any other HDMI capable device) to our projector, treadmill tv, and bar tv. Also, we need to find a sound system that is versatile to fit an irregular-shaped room.


Any recommendations? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just recently graduated from a University with a Masters degree. I met said girl last year at a school career center presentation. We both have graduated but she found a job first. (FYI: Her job is currently in the American southwest and I am in the American northeast.) We communicate through Facebook mostly.


I am interested in her and we share many common interests. Our discussions are usually about said common interests and I often link articles of interest to her. I think from our discussions she knows I am interested in her, yet I feel directly asking should come with a follow-up plan. I would like to broach the subject of a relationship (which is potentially LDR), but I am uncertain how to proceed. 


I have 2 main points I need help with:


1) Best way to gauge interest in LDR.


2) Best plan to maintain relationship.


Wild Card: I have several interviews for jobs in different areas of the country. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need help with iPhone 5 battery replacement - what can we do? </TITLE>

<TEXT> My main concern is that the iPhone is not used heavily, especially during my dad's work. He spends most of his time on a computer terminal on the job, only using the phone to read texts or email from family. Bluetooth was on regularly to connect to a fitbit until recently (when I appropriated fitbit for myself). The wifi is turned on, but not connected to any wifi except the one at home. None of these should explain the need to charge every several hours, at least to me.


Earlier this afternoon, we went to Apple store in response to a previous post about certain iPhones being at risk for premature battery failure. The iPhone in question falls under the serial number range stated by Apple.


While spending over half an hour attempting to communicate our desire to replace the battery, the genius said that the battery is within normal limits of use and drain. Meanwhile, since we had arrived at the Apple store, the battery drained from 100% to 88% right in front of the genius's eyes. The only thing the genius told us to do was to change the settings of autobrightness and wifi and Bluetooth.
