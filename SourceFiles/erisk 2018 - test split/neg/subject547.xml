<TEXT> in the scene that the boys are fighting while the plane blows up for the second time does it make sense for the explosion of the plane to burst all the windows at the terminal? It seems a bit excessive and not plausible and i was wondering if that is accurate. Any thoughts or actuall knowledge on how accurate that and the plane's disfunction was in the first place? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, sorry. I'm trying to say that kapkan's traps kill and frost's down so there shouldn't be any reason to change kapkan's speed when the reason (at least i feel) is that frost is faster is because her traps don't kill people instantly and she needs to run to them as someone get's downed by one{unless you're using a tactic and cav is there} if kapkan is 2-2, that just adds another op operator with amazing traps to walk around like mute and strafe. He will become the new main for almost every team. Maybe that's not a bad thing. I guess i'm just too used to him being an aromord operator and i like it too much for the extra bullet he takes compared to frost or mute. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Somehow accidentaly jerry and purposly rick. They explain this throughout the episode. How many times have you watched it? Have you read the subtitles the first time?
Sorry i'm in a little rush, i didnt answer. They wanted the concentrated dark matter formula, that's how rick blew them up. He faked the recipe for it and it made them all die and he was like. Yeah jerry. They were sooo smart back there </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty sure that "compromised" does NOT mean broken. If this is the case, in which it is. The portal gun was still in rick's presence on gazorazorp thus resulting in it needing to be fixed, not taken by the council of ricks like in the premire. Only rick is the supreeme being and deserves the rigjt and benifet of the doubt to use such a device. So they only want it broken or confiscated if a simpleton has it. Like bob your friend with absolute average capabilities </TEXT>

defense just stay in the room unless you hear thump thump thump unless the obj is going down.
Do this untill you figuire out exactly what you're doing and only play casual untill you really memorized the maps and camera locations(espesially on the outside of the map).

<TEXT> I agree, but i also think that it has to do with the way that you are raised as well. I like the opisite sex for reasons..but i don't think that it seems gross to like the same gender, i can tell when someone of the same sex is attractive because i find them attractive but i still think that there's just something about where i fit in that tells me that i do much prefer the opisite sex from myself. Maybe the fact of who you like or identify as has to do with the level of pasionate intentions comimg from your brain and sending to your heart </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah, but the whole point of this game is  not to suck so bad that you never get kills due to un awareness, this game just takes time managment, patience and awarness and you don't need teamates on casual unless they're a team of 5 that went on to casual to have fun by "beating noobs" but like i said this game is easy if you treat it more like every action that you do matters (not judging but you've probably never played vegas 1or2 and therefore have no idea what to do in the defend phaseor for that matter the action phase) </TEXT>
