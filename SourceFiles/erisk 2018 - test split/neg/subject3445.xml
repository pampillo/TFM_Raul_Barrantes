<TEXT> This underground movement aimed to uphold the "Blue Code of Silence" allows officers to get away with crimes for which other citizens have to pay fines and do time. The article links out to a New York Times article reporting how officers showed up to the [arraignment of 16 officers](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/nyregion/officers-unleash-anger-at-ticket-fixing-arraignments-in-the-bronx.html) charged with extending this professional courtesy. Although the headline read the officers were being arraigned for ticket-fixing, one "was accused of two dozen crimes, including attempted robbery, attempted grand larceny, transporting what he thought was heroin for drug dealers and revealing the identity of a confidential informant." 

Is this the same culture that makes some officers think they're justified in irresponsibly shooting people without justification? Love to hear your feelings.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It didn't even occur to me about the shipping applications of this technology. I could see a whole line of new companies rising to disrupt the shipping industry's modus operandi. It will also probably eliminate all the regulatory and technological challenges that drone delivery is encountering. It is going to be interesting to see both modes of transport go head to head; however, this model sounds a lot better. Even regarding safety, statistically speaking flying is the safest way to travel. However, Reuters reported that although trains get into more accidents than planes, [plane accidents kill more people](http://blogs.reuters.com/data-dive/2015/02/04/trains-have-more-accidents-but-plane-crashes-kill-more-people/). In 2014, the Aviation Safety Network recorded "21 fatal airliner accidents," that killed 990 people. The Federal Railroad Office of Safety Analysis recorded only six passenger deaths on 2,096 railroad accidents.

Edit: I know these aren't trains, but I surmise operating underground, like some trains are conducted, organizations can better account for more variables, which compromise safety, than what airlines can do in the air. I also know that pilots are very rigorously trained. Most come from a military background and have had to been flying for several thousand hours, if I'm not mistaken, to fly commercially. Perhaps if train or tube operators would be required to undergo the same level of rigorous training as airline pilots, you could significantly lower the number of train or potential tube accidents, making this a much safer way to travel and ship cargo.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much, professor! I am so honored to be considered especially by you, for you taught me so much through your contributions. I really dig deep into a couple of the studies you submit. And although there is still a lot I have to learn, I have gained a better understanding of the peer-review system reading your collections; the information has also shaped some of my decision-making towards performing a few actions that produce the most favorable results based on some findings. 

I would love to help r/futurology explore what the vast future holds. It is so incredible what is being done to repair the human body through stem cell repair. I am excited about experiencing all the developments towards interplanetary travel; hope we finally discover how to fly through a wormhole and make light year travel possible :) But even the more viable breakthroughs that are to be made towards a manned flight to Mars really make me proud of what humans are accomplishing right now. AI development, technology with applications for sustainable energy, and everything that is so close to coming to fruition really needs every chance it can get to be communicated and supported. I would utterly be honored to help move the conversation forward through a more involved contribution to this sub.

I am very grateful for your contribution and that of the rest of the mods on Reddit, for you give your most valuable resource: your time. I see your activity flooded with actions in order to maintain the content quality and keep making Reddit, what I think, is the best content and news site on the planet. Thank you again! I greatly appreciate all you have done for us.

Please enjoy the rest of your weekend!

<TEXT> This paper has examined three massifs in the southernmost Heritage Range in order to help date the Ellsworth glacial trimline, a feature representing a significant thickening and expansion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Coupling detailed geomorphological analysis with an intensive campaign of cosmogenic nuclide exposure age dating, we show that glacial erosion of surfaces associated with the trimline is not of LGM or indeed Pleistocene age. The lower parts were covered by ice during the LGM, but the effect, in common with all Pleistocene fluctuations, was to add and redistribute blue-ice morainic debris onto an already eroded bedrock surface. Exposure age dating demonstrates that the surfaces adjacent to the trimline were sculpted more than two million years ago. Landforms indicating the presence of warm-based ice and meltwater at the edge of a large ice sheet require a climate similar to present-day Greenland where surface melting occurs at least seasonally. We argue that in Antarctica this last occurred in the mid-Miocene 14 million years ago. During the middle Miocene and subsequently, glacial erosion has lowered the glaciers in relation to the mountains by deepening surrounding troughs.

Would not expect anybody to feel that way, but I thank you so much for sharing your feelings on Yoda's transcendence. I could totally see how he could be just an isolated power source through which the strongest part of the force is channelled. 

Nonetheless, with all due respect, I can't get enough of watching Yoda kick ass :) But that's what makes us great as humans. We can all possess diverse opinions and feelings of what is grand and majestic. And each opinion opens up our mind to other possibilities and thought patterns. 

Thanks for sharing that note. Have a great day! </TEXT>

<TEXT> They can probably make up for it in TLJ, but that snatches the ability of TFA standing on its own. One of the elements of Episode I to III that kept me engaged was the improved fighting skill with which the Jedi and Sith wielded the lightsabers. The flips and strikes were more frequent and faster. If they would have used special effects to show the skills worthy of a Jedi grandmaster into which Luke had evolved, like when Yoda first fought Dooku and then the Sith Lord, I think the crowd would have been cheering and not complaining that they only got to see Luke for a couple of minutes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have to watch it again, but, based on what I can immediately recall (do correct me if I"m wrong), I don't think it would have taken away much from Rey's story. In fact it would have probably been more plausible to emphasize how Ren was really much stronger than Rey, as he probably had more formal training. 

And in terms of Luke's part, I am at least 98 percent sure that people in the  audience would be cheering, like when Yoda first started flipping and showed off the best of his lightsaber skills against Dooku, in the theatre at which I saw it; people went nuts. At the end of TFA, nonetheless, I heard at least 4 to 5 people complaining that you only got to see Luke for two minutes. One guy stood up and said he got ripped off. 

With such an anticipated return, with special effects they could have done a lot better with Luke's entrance.  </TEXT>

However, I liked Luke's entrance; I surmise it would have been more positively impactful if something with an equal level of drama and action would have been instituted in the original film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We find that EGUs in the Eastern U.S. region from 2007 to 2012 exhibited a 3.87%  0.41% increase in electricity generation per C increase during summer months. This is associated with a 3.35%/C  0.50%/C increase in SO2 emissions, a 3.60%/C  0.49%/C increase in NOX emissions, and a 3.32%/C  0.36%/C increase in CO2 emissions. Sensitivities vary by year and by pollutant, with SO2 both the highest sensitivity (5.04% in 2012) and lowest sensitivity (2.19% in 2007) in terms of a regional average. Texas displays 20072012 sensitivities of 2.34%/C  0.28%/C for generation, 0.91%/C  0.25%/C for SO2 emissions, 2.15%/C  0.29%/C for NOX emissions, and 1.78%/C  0.22%/C for CO2 emissions. These results suggest demand-side and supply side technological improvements and fuel choice could play an important role in cost-effective reduction of carbon emissions and air pollution.

<TEXT> What stood out to me the most was that younger men are carrying on the same antiquated attitudes as the older generation before them:

Most young men in the Middle East and North Africa still hold traditional attitudes similar to their fathers toward women's role in society

 In Palestine, Egypt, and Morocco, there was little difference
between younger and older men on gender attitudes

In other words, in Morocco, Palestine, and Egypt, younger mens
views on gender equality do not differ substantially from those of older men.

<TEXT> I'm basing my assumptions on the following part of the study:

i) Josh is on the way to the airport to catch a flight for a hunting safari in Africa. He leaves with plenty of time to make it there, but his car breaks down on the highway. Now Josh is sitting in his car near a busy intersection and knows he needs to get to airport soon if he is going to catch his flight.

ii) Is it possible or impossible for Josh to [(a)] hail a taxi at the intersection, [(b)] fix his car by banging on it, [(c)] teleport himself to the airport, [(d)] sneak onto public transportation, or [(e)] sell his car for a ride to the airport?

Feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but it appears [(d)] is rated as immoral and improbable. Some one with a criminal background may not see any of these actions as immoral or, much less, improbable. Just to give you an example, in New York City it was a common practice to not pay subway fare by evading the turnstiles by simply walking through the exit door. Even people who wouldn't commit more serious crimes and held nine-to-five jobs did it. When a transit police unit was put in force and people started to get frisked, ticketed, and arrested for not paying subway fares, then the police discovered that many fare dodgers were armed with guns and knives and were on their way to mug people and perform more violent crimes in the subways. However, there were a few that were simply used to not paying the subway fare, and they were released with a summons. 

With the added security at train stations I guess it would be harder to test a sample of people who would think dodging a subway fare is acceptable. I still know some younger people who do it though. 

EDIT: One last thing: I do notice that older people who have had criminal backgrounds are more cynical and see criminal activity as the daily norm; they're not surprised when they see people get mugged, raped, shot, or bombed on the news. Hence some one like that may see a criminal act as immoral (just to be politically correct or not perceived to be stupid, perhaps) but such a person would not see the same act as improbable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing that screams out to me the most is that the [study's participants'](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/04/17/1619717114.full) were all hired from mechanical turk; keyword probably being *hired.* I don't know the exact demo on mechanical turks, but I am sure most share the idiosyncrasies of people who would widely be classified as moral: people who want to to get paid for performing legal tasks or work that for the most part may be considered to be moral. 

For some of these scenarios, I think the results would have been dramatically different if participants with a criminal background or even prison inmates reported their opinions. Having grown up with many people with criminal backgrounds, I know their classification of what is moral to be totally different than that of some one who would never commit a crime because such a person would simply would not need to. 

I knew a lot of people who sold crack cocaine back in the late eighties and early nineties because they simply didn't know of any other way to financially support themselves. They didn't know how to write a resume, cover letter, or present themselves professionally, and many were unable to land even a job paying minimum wage. 

Such people look at morality in a totally different light. They may not think selling drugs is immoral because otherwise, in their mind, how would they survive and perhaps feed themselves and, and in some cases, their children? Even some one who told police officers about a crime would be considered immoral because you are supposed to resolve your own conflicts. Police officers were and are considered to be an enemy in people who live in inner cities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The capacity for representing and reasoning over sets of possibilities, or modal cognition, supports diverse kinds of high-level judgments: causal reasoning, moral judgment, language comprehension, and more. Prior research on modal cognition asks how humans explicitly and deliberatively reason about what is possible but has not investigated whether or how people have a default, implicit representation of which events are possible. We present three studies that characterize the role of implicit representations of possibility in cognition. Collectively, these studies differentiate explicit reasoning about possibilities from default implicit representations, demonstrate that human adults often default to treating immoral and irrational events as impossible, and provide a case study of high-level cognitive judgments relying on default implicit representations of possibility rather than explicit deliberation.

<TEXT> Common chimps and bonobos are our closest living relatives but almost nothing is known about bonobo internal anatomy. We present the first phylogenetic analysis to include musculoskeletal data obtained from a recent dissection of bonobos. Notably, chimpanzees, and in particular bonobos, provide a remarkable case of evolutionary stasis for since the chimpanzee-human split c.8 Ma among 120 head-neck (HN) and forelimb (FL) muscles there were only four minor changes in the chimpanzee clade, and all were reversions to the ancestral condition. Moreover, since the common chimpanzee-bonobo split c.2 Ma there have been no changes in bonobos, so with respect to HN-FL musculature bonobos are the better model for the last common ancestor (LCA) of chimpanzees/bonobos and humans. Moreover, in the hindlimb there are only two muscle absence/presence differences between common chimpanzees and bonobos. Puzzlingly, there is an evolutionary mosaicism between each of these species and humans. We discuss these data in the context of available genomic information and debates on whether the common chimpanzee-bonobo divergence is linked to heterochrony.

<TEXT> Background: Adolescent bullying may be a key driver of interest in cosmetic surgery. This study examined the extent of such interest and whether any effect was sex-specific, and examined psychological functioning as a potential mechanism through which bullying involvement may lead to a wish for cosmetic surgery.

Methods: A two-stage design was used. In the first stage, 2782 adolescents (aged 11 to 16 years) were screened for bullying involvement using self-reports and peer nominations. In the second stage, 752 adolescents who were bullies, victims, bully-victims, or uninvolved in bullying reported their desire for cosmetic surgery. Psychological functioning was constructed as a composite of self-esteem and emotional problems (assessed at stage 1) and body-esteem scores (assessed at stage 2).

Results: Adolescents involved in bullying in any role were significantly more interested in cosmetic surgery than uninvolved adolescents. Desire for cosmetic surgery was greatest in adolescents who were bullied (victims and bully-victims) and girls. Desire for cosmetic surgery was highest in girls, but sex did not interact with bullying role. Being victimized by peers resulted in poor psychological functioning, which increased desire for cosmetic surgery. In contrast, desire for cosmetic surgery in bullies was not related to psychological functioning, which was in the normal range.

Conclusions: Bullying victimization is related to poor psychological functioning, and both are related to a greater desire for cosmetic surgery in adolescents. Cosmetic surgeons should screen candidates for psychological vulnerability and may want to include a short screening questionnaire for a history of peer victimization.

In Washington D.C., recent legislation authorizes citizens to test if products are properly represented and, if they are not, to bring a lawsuit for the benefit of the general public. Recent studies revealing the widespread phenomenon of seafood substitution across the United States make it a fertile area for consumer protection testing. DNA barcoding provides an accurate and cost-effective way to perform these tests, especially when tissue alone is available making species identification based on morphology impossible. In this study, we sequenced the 5 barcoding region of the Cytochrome Oxidase I gene for 12 samples of vertebrate and invertebrate food items across six restaurants in Washington, D.C. and used multiple analytical methods to make identifications. These samples included several ambiguous menu listings, sequences with little genetic variation among closely related species and one sequence with no available reference sequence. Despite these challenges, we were able to make identifications for all samples and found that 33% were potentially mislabeled. While we found a high degree of mislabeling, the errors involved closely related species and we did not identify egregious substitutions as have been found in other cities. This study highlights the efficacy of DNA barcoding and robust analyses in identifying seafood items for consumer protection.

<TEXT> According to the journal article the students and the teachers reported to sleep better:

Most teaching staff (n = 60, 95.2%) appreciated the adjustment of the new SST. They reported that their students displayed improved concentration (74.1%), reduced dozing off (68.9%), and reduced the tardiness rate (69.5%). In addition, 85% of teachers reported their own improvement in the teaching and daily schedule, and 63% of them reported improvement of their own sleep.

Our results demonstrated that adolescents gained more sleep after a modest delay in SST from 7:45 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., either compared to a comparison school or by self-comparison. The increase in total time in bed was due mainly to later wake-up time. To the best of our knowledge, the delay of 15 min is the shortest delay intervention that has been reported in the existing literature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like your line of thinking. Probably the same way we should approach drug abuse. 

One of the hardest problems I encounter when trying to eat clean, dramatically limiting to completely erasing my consumption of sugar, high density carbs, junk food, etc., is that there aren't many options for me to eat right outdoors in most neighborhoods, malls, and other places. Even a place like Panera, has great salads, but they only go great with the delicious breads, pastries, and lattes they serve. So you negate a lot of the benefits of the salad. To top it off, my favorite soup there is the turkey chili, and they take it off the menu every summer.

I can travel to Manhattan where there are a lot of options for me to go to a place like Chop't and pick up a hearty salad with low-fat grilled chicken; and drink a unsweetened green tea; but it's always a headache to get parking out there and everything is also more expensive. 

How about creating tax incentives, government subsidies, grants etc. to start restaurants that focus on eating whole non-processed foods? Perhaps that could get places like Chop't opening locations in the suburbs and maybe the inner-city and road trip stops. 

I know eating home is the best option, and I have no problem with cooking from Monday to Friday. But I don't want to cook, nor does my wife on the weekends, and that's where we struggle to keep a good diet. And we are in fairly good shape with probably more will power than a lot of other people. Yet we still love our cheat days; that said, I know there are people whose struggle with sugar addiction is far worse.

<TEXT> Firstly, that lady is new. I shop at that Rite Aid regularly and know the pharmacists well. I fill my children's prescriptions in that store. It's also located in one of the better suburbish neighborhoods of Queens - Howard Beach; we're mostly all homeowners, and, in comparison to the rest of the city, you don't get a lot of crime in our area. 

Secondly, by her accent, I could tell she is from a non-Hispanic Caribbean island (I grew up with a lot of them). And even if I am wrong, and she is Hispanic that doesn't mean she can't be racist against her own ethnic group. I know a lot of Latinos, blacks, and whites who are racist among each other. 

Thirdly, I am not the victim in this case. She is. She is probably underpaid hence undertrained and has to resort to preconceived notions that she has to follow some one because of his her ethnicity like it's 1970. As a business owner, if she really thought I was suspicious, she could simply watch me through the surveillance cameras; she could proactively prevent me from coming back with a better plan to really shoplift something - potentially when she's not around. This company's headquarters has also contacted me to correct the situation; and as a loyal customer, I doubt this will end favorably for her. 

Sincerely, I wish her the best, and I hope she doesn't get fired, but better trained. As a society, it is truly sad that racism has to reduce our workforce to behave so unproductively. We are a lot better than this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was 30 F outside; I had a cold; hence the hoodie. You could see everybody else had coats in the store. My wife and I were the only dark-skinned people.

Thanks for watching, but take note: Trayvon Martin was identified by his killer as being suspicious, describing him in a hoodie.

EDIT: Being a business owner, I would have preferred she focused on watching me in through the surveillance cameras if I looked suspicious. If I was really shoplifting, I would not do it with her on my back. I would just come back when she's not hawking me. Her racist preconceptions turn her into an inefficient security guard. She is very under trained.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to kung-fu movies that I would watch after Saturday morning cartoons, the television networks used to also broadcast a Clint Eastwood or other type of western-type movie that I would watch when it was too cold to go outside. I had no problem watching these before-my-time yet great movies. The casting, storyline, videography and other elements broken down in this analysis make movies like these timeless. 

And Clint Eastwood is still kicking ass. Million Dollar Baby, American Sniper; both classics in their own rights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure whether this is an authentic claim; but if its fake, its sad that he would attempt to secure fame at the expense of the memory of one of America's worst tragedies. I am from New York City, and although I didn't know anybody personally who died in the towers, I know people who knew people that died. 

It was a direct attack on our city and country. Although I was not allowed to enter Ground Zero, I never felt more compelled to help out in the rescue efforts as an utterly selfless act than I did on that day, and when I returned a couple of days later. 

My uncle is a firefighter that was assigned to Ground Zero, and he told me he saw body parts; he told me it was the worst thing he had ever seen when I interviewed him for a school writing assignment a couple of years later. There are still first responders who are suffering from severe ailments. 

Thousands of peoples of lives were lost and irreparably damaged as a result. And it was not in retaliation to something that they directly did to anybody. Innocent lives were lost, and it's disgusting if any one should ever seek to fraudulently profit from this mass murder. </TEXT>

Collecting personal data is every tech giant and government's evil master plan. If they don't get you one way, they'll figure out another way. It's great we have outlets like this, so we could all collaborate to maintain privacy.  

Sadly enough, (I may be wrong) I think that our never-ending quest to get the most out of apps, the web, tech for the lowest cost possible has opened the competitive landscape so much that companies are not forced but have been steered into exploring data collection as a monetization play. The human mind is capable of so much, however, so I am sure there are other ways that companies and the government can be sustainable without knowing the width of every ridge along the ring of our buttholes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not too sure, for he showed past defenders were unable to deflect a shot when the shooter pump faked, after being challenged by the left hand, and went up the middle. But he could probably be illustrating how even on offense "old school" players performed more effectively. I think his intended outcome was to highlight the mistake that the defender could easily correct by mirroring the ball with his left hand. Hence not a negative critique of today's total defensive approach, but just a recommendation on how that one deficiency can be easily corrected.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly; dozens as in multiples of 12. We had our 100 call days; but there was no robodialer or pre-recorded intro; we dialed the numbers ourselves; and we weren't allowed to hang up. I think we had to get approval for a follow-up call. Moreover, the calls that we felt had potential would last long; sometimes more than 20 minutes. 

I have been more effective allowing for follow-up calls and without hammering a lead until he hangs up; so the strategy did suck; but we were basically just burger flippers lifting the spatula the pre-determined amount of times.

Edit: these days were non-stop 7 to 7 shifts. You will be convinced that I worked hard and the job sucked :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote dozens because it wasn't hundreds of calls. You did spend some time with some people on the line on a few calls if you felt you could sell him; so you could only physically call the amount of people for which you had time. We weren't supposed to hang up on anybody, unless they hung up on us first. And we worked 7 to 7 nonstop. I would say the range was from 60 to 100 calls. 

Edit: No robo dialer or pre-recorded intro; this was like 95. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually worked in one of these chop shops about 20 years ago, selling stock for the Stratosphere in Vegas. The owner of the place didn't have to put on a big speech to get us to sign on, for making $200 a week didn't sound that bad living between a room and taking ladies to my aunt's unfinished basement at 19. Only two of us worked under some dude who said he was the Vice President of the firm. 

We would say we were him over the phone. 

We had to memorize a few pages full of rebuttals that we kept pinned on the fabric wall. I made dozens of calls daily. Everybody said no, hung the phone up on me, or gave me the run around. I learned how to talk really fast, and there were a few times that I was almost close enough to sell somebody, but they either stopped picking up the phone or said no on a follow up call.

After 4 weeks I made my first sale of 150 shares; however, I closed him myself; they never told me to refer the call to my boss. He simply called the client back and got him to buy more shares. My boss cut off my tie, and pinned it against the wall next to my rebuttals. After a couple of days, I was given $20 because I was supposed to have split it with my co-worker because he was behind me while I was on the phone. My commission was supposed to be a couple of hundred bucks. 

I was also supposed to get back pay for the weeks that I worked; I never got paid. I went to complain to the owner, and he left me waiting at his door. 

After that I was told I was going to be laid off. I asked my boss for my money; he said that the firm didn't have any funds. 

I spilled coffee over all the phones in our cubicle and walked out. 

Anyway, based on all the sales encounters I have experienced, Boiler Room is not too realistic. Not a lot of people will bite when you give them easy ways to exit the sales transaction like what they do in Boiler Room. 

Wolf of Wall Street, although may exaggerate somewhat, is more realistic. I would like to see what these guys do for Belfort. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is so terrible; my heart goes out to the family of this man. But it's important for people to know, so they can be alert and very careful when dealing with snow. 

This accident is unlike it, but I got into a car accident years ago in the snow that could have killed me and my cousin. And the only thing that caused the accident is that he was driving at around the speed limit. The car skid on an uneven patch of snow and spun, knocked down highway light pole, and stopped after crashing into a tree. I had my foot on the windshield, so I wouldn't fly out of it when the car crashed.

Be very careful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the advice; it is a little Buddhist monk exercise. I get it from Wim Hof (he's my hero). I have read that tolerating cold temperatures holds a number of health benefits. You develop something called [Brown Adipose Tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue) that helps you stay fit and strengthens your immune system. First hand, cold showers always take any aches I may have when I work out too strenuously. I started by taking cold showers about 13 years ago. Now I could tolerate single-digit weather for a couple of hours before I start shaking.  </TEXT>

Sessions, nonetheless, appears he will do what he has to do to keep his job. Hence if Trump says to legalize or don't interfere, I don't think Sessions will move against his boss's orders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My condolences, man. I have a good idea of what it must have been like.

My grandfather had it too. He got lost in the neighborhood a couple of times. He eventually forgot every one. He once smashed the sink into pieces with a hammer. He ultimately even forgot how to eat. When he was being fed through a tube, some of the food got into his lungs, and that was it. 

Before dementia, my grandfather was like the father to me that his son wasn't. He used to take me to work with him. He bought me my first computer, a Commodore 64. I wish he would have been able to see me now as a responsible adult, for I gave him a lot of headaches being a knucklehead when I was in high school. 

He was the kind of guy who visited as many members of his family that he could. He helped his daughters buy their first house. A great guy that got along with everybody. 

Take care; thanks for sharing.  </TEXT>

As you noted, he has no power to determine what is legal. Further, with most states having legalized marijuana in some form, and the billions of dollars and over 100K jobs that the marijuana industry is pumping into the economy, he *is* indeed powerless. Regardless of how he feels about marijuana, he understands he is unable to stand adamantly in opposition to popular opinion and the citizenry's liberty if he wants to lead a successful career working in government.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you did not; marijuana is already legal in some form in most states. The industry employs more than 100K people, and is set to make a $40 to $50 billion impact to the economy in less than 10 years. Regardless of Sessions's personal opinions on marijuana, all the political and economic pressure applied from a thriving industry will not allow him to stop a moving bullet train. The tree has blossomed!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, if he is going to do what the President tells him, Trump has said he supports [medical marijuana](https://youtu.be/LqofXgLAI04?t=9s) and that he would leave the decision to [legalize marijuana up to the states.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWIQhDbs1g8) He is basically doubling down on Trump's comments by saying that if illegal marijuana is undesired in the states, Congress should legalize cannabis.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes; looking at it that way, I probably judged too soon. Having been in a flood, I know how quick you may have to react if you don't want to end up waving rags on top of your roof so the rescue choppers could see you. 

I probably just reflected on the fact that although I love dogs (I was raised with one), I do not own one because my kids already consume so much of my free time.  Hence I prefer not to own one for I wouldn't have the time to walk it and play with it as much I should. That said I figured that if you can't care enough to save a dog that you should treat as part of the family, then you should not own one.

However, as you wrote, there are situations where human life must be prioritized at a moment's notice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My older boy, 9, especially, is like that, and my 6-year-old is following suit. They're heavy into games and web stuff. The older one has always been narrowly focused on vehicles, mainly cars. He looks at them real closely and analyzes every feature of his Hot Wheels and Cars Movie characters. If he saw a phone or a car-shaped object, he would lean pennies against it to make it look like a car. 

Until now, people are very impressed with both of my boys' knowledge of cars and topics in which they're are really interested. They can articulate topics that I only know a little bit about. Perhaps your toddler is going be the same way. 

The bad side is that they don't want to go outside. I want them to also be at least partially athletic, so they can be healthy humans. But with the information that they consume on how bad food and sedentary habits hurt humans, I think they'll eventually come around to being more active. I made them watch Super Size Me yesterday, and my older one wants to eat salad.

As long as your toddler is safe in his room, I would let him focus on what he wants. You'll be amazed at what he will come up with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The photographing and mirror tip resonates with me. I just came back from a trip overseas where I was taking video selfies each time I ate something. I typically eat whatever I want when on vacation, for my meals mainly consist of meat, fruit, and veggies for health issues. I got more concerned with looking at myself to ensure that I didn't have food in my teeth when I smiled and filming the next shot, nonetheless, that I didn't eat as much as I do when I go off of my regular diet. 

I don't think the red plate tactic works for me though. My wife typically serves my food on a red plate that is mostly reserved for me, and I still feel hungry sometimes when I empty it. I do work out though and am generally an active person, so that probably explains my increased appetite.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a little ["internet battle scenario"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJbeHslFiKk). I am sure these lions have seen this happen more than a few times. I am unable to find the video; but I did see where some zoologists were scolding the tribes people for killing off too many lions. 

Humans are the most lethal creature on the planet because of our use of tools. If you're like me from a city, we may not be much of a match for these lions; however, these hunter gatherers are accustomed to having to deal with these animals like people in New York City have to kill mice. If they have to work at it every day for decades, they're going to be pretty efficient lion hunters, and the lions must know that. Why else would they go in armed if it was solely walking upright that made them jet? 

Edit: Further if they have been convinced that killing lions does not benefit the overall environment (perhaps to prevent over population of animals that are prey), they probably just steal food non-violently to avoid killing them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Carbon-14 measurements on 231 elephant ivory specimens from 14 large ivory seizures (0.5 ton) made between 2002 and 2014 show that most ivory (ca. 90%) was derived from animals that had died less than 3 y before ivory was confiscated. This indicates that the assumption of recent elephant death for mortality estimates of African elephants is correct: Very little old ivory is included in large ivory shipments from Africa. We found only one specimen of the 231 analyzed to have a lag time longer than 6 y. Patterns of trade differ by regions: East African ivory, based on genetic assignments of geographic origin, has a much higher fraction of rapid transit than ivory originating in the Tridom region of CameroonGabonCongo. Carbon-14 is an important tool in understanding patterns of movement of illegal wildlife products.

The second half, nonetheless, gets a couple of days at least, and it tastes a lot better; it does go in the freezer though; so it may not be a couple of days really; just the time it takes to defrost in the fridge. I use regular white vinegar; but squeezing two lemons on about 2 1/2 lbs. of salmon is what gives it the taste I like.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The growing use and legalization of cannabis are leading to increased exposures across all age groups, including in adolescence. The touting of its medicinal values stems from anecdotal reports related to treatment of a broad range of illnesses including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscle spasms, arthritis, obesity, cancer, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, post-traumatic stress, inflammatory bowel disease, and anxiety. However, it is critical that societal passions not obscure objective assessments of any potential and realized short- and long-term adverse effects of cannabis, particularly with respect to age of onset and chronicity of exposure. This critical review focuses on evidence-based research designed to assess both therapeutic benefits and harmful effects of cannabis exposure, and is combined with an illustration of the neuropathological findings in a fatal case of cannabis-induced psychosis. The literature and reported case provide strong evidence that chronic cannabis abuse causes cognitive impairment and damages the brain, particularly white matter, where cannabinoid 1 receptors abound. Contrary to popular perception, there is little objective data supporting preferential use of cannabis over conventional therapy for restoration of central nervous system structure and function in disease states such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, or schizophrenia. Additional research is needed to determine if sub-sets of individuals with various neurological and psychiatric diseases derive therapeutic benefits from cannabis.

I also partially wish my dad was around to teach me something productive. When I got to know him better as an adult, one of the few things he *tried* to teach me was how to cheat people by using a pencil when you draft an agreement for them. Then all you have to do is erase the old agreement, write a new one on the same paper, and lie to the person. **It was terrible advice that I would never tell my children or any one else to follow.**

That said, and in light of other things I have witnessed from him, it's probably better I didn't grow up with him. 

It is never too late to seek positive enlightenment and encouragement from people who know how to be successful at anything you want to do, my friend. Take care! And do anything you want with your life. All the best!

We may not have all the advantages that we had as children, but we could carve out small amount of times and work towards our objectives regardless, I think. Thanks for taking a look. All the best to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He actually hits the rim on most of his attempts behind the free-throw line which amounted to 52 in total. Once I see he can hit the rim regularly from a particular distance, I am very confident that he is be able to make the basket, under an hour, with a little more power when he shoots; that's why I pushed him until he made it. When he was throwing too many air balls from that final distance, I would have him stand closer to the basket. Half a year ago he was shooting air from only a couple of feet from the basket. 

I also watched some coaching videos on shooting with proper form. Teaching him how to shoot the ball from the padding on his fingers, keeping his elbows pointed at the basket, while extending his arm fully (like reaching for a cooking jar) helped him propel the ball a lot farther. I only played basketball on the street; so I am learning it formally to make him as good as he wants to be. 

Thanks for sharing your experience. I actually have my six-year old practicing his shooting with a smaller ball. He can't hit the rim yet shooting with good form, but we're working.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most definitely! My six-year-old was surprised to see that my nine-year old made the basket after taking a break and complaining that it was taking long to make it. And you're right, it gave me a big confidence boost and totally made my week! We've been working toward this for half a year, and it felt great to get it done. Thanks for taking a look! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My six-year old was surprised that after a break, my nine-year old made the basket after complaining that it was taking long to make the shot. However, I think the habit of him having to make a shot before we always go home lead him to the free-throw line, where he shot it as hard as he could and landed it. Thanks for taking a look!  </TEXT>

Get him one of those toy hoops and start the baby early. That's the one thing I would do if I have another baby. I think they learn to love it a lot more if they could do it well early. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words. I'm definitely trying to celebrate his failed attempts as best he can, so he could love the work and get through  frustration. What I like about these exercises is that it boosts his self esteem. He discovers that there are activities he can accomplish that he thought were insurmountable. And this confidence helps him behave and score better grades in school. </TEXT>

It still makes up a small portion of his day; yesterday we spent a little under a hour on his shot until he made it. The rest of the day he wants to game and watch videos on gaming. Trying hard to diversify and make his days more productive with sports, reading, and writing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only advantage imo is the space you get and potential autonomy with that space. But you could rent a house and get just as much space. The problem finance-wise is that a home is really a liability if you're just living in it. In this market, some people can't sell the home and pull a profit. The home hasn't appreciated enough, or their lines of credit against past-earned equity aren't paid off. Further, if you include maintenance costs, interest, insurance, etc. you're going to spend more than what you would in rent in a lot of situations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's great to hear how your son is progressing. I'm sure he's getting smarter too, as I see kids are more alert as they learn how to play sports better. And I know the feeling of having him get a shot in. My son hasn't done so in a game, but in practice it cheers us up real nice every time he makes it from a new distance.

I'm planning on getting my son into a local league too when the season starts in the fall. That's why I'm pushing him to get his shots and his dribbling down better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's definitely not a natural athlete, but he's into it enough that he'll stick with the practice and do the drills. What's cool is that he gets into such a good mood after he makes one of these farther from the basket. We didn't go on Tuesday, and he as bit aggravated we didn't go. I've also got him into soccer twice a week, so he could get his legs worked out. Trying to get him off of the video game hook as much as possible :)

Thanks for taking a look and for the advice. And best of wishes for your son and daughter.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is his reward. I actually motivate him by letting him play. I'm instilling discipline by teaching him how to play sports and having him do writing assignments (at which he needs some work). 

Most kids I know just get caught up with video games and don't want to do anything else. Even when Super Mario was released in like '86, I believe, I remember I played it until I had calluses on my thumbs. Once I beat Mario, it wasn't as easy to get other games like it is now. You had to pay like $40 for one, if I remember correctly. And I lived with a single mother who couldn't afford to get another game once I beat the old one. So I started going outside again. Until I got Zelda :) But I would typically get to play new games after I conquered the old one months or years later. 

Now games are a lot more involved and better at keeping kids hooked, IMHO. And if they do get bored of one, another is just a click of an app store away.

Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow! That's a great story! Maybe he'll become a hot automotive engineer, race car driver, or the next Elon Musk. I used to envy my mechanic friend's skills when we were like 16; he taught me how to perform a few fixes on my own cars that have helped me out of more than a few tough spots back when I rolled with the hoopties all the time. If your godson has a knack to tinker with machinery, that's a great calling, with unlimited opportunity! Wish him all the best! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the obvious solution is have governments invest more on education and access to education. However, I think whatever added investment has to ensure that the direction of revamped curriculums aim to encourage children to enjoy or at least tolerate to be educated. Humans, for the most part, avoid education. And you could see it manifest itself at an early age. The opening of more disciplines a child can master, I believe can get more people educated and free of these issues that are plaguing people globally.  </TEXT>

The higher exposure to fast food near more disadvantaged schools may reflect lower commercial land cost in low-SES areas, potentially creating more financially desirable investments for fast-food developers.

Given anecdotal reports of domestic pets alerting owners to blood glucose changes, especially hypoglycemia (1), we hypothesized that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath might change at low glucose.

<TEXT> Placebo effects pose problems for some intervention studies, particularly those with no clearly identified mechanism. Cognitive training falls into that category, and yet the role of placebos in cognitive interventions has not yet been critically evaluated. Here, we show clear evidence of placebo effects after a brief cognitive training routine that led to significant fluid intelligence gains. Our goal is to emphasize the importance of ruling out alternative explanations before attributing the effect to interventions. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers account for placebo effects before claiming treatment effects.

<TEXT> Recent accounts suggest that accountability pressures have trickled down into the early elementary grades and that kindergarten today is characterized by a heightened focus on academic skills and a reduction in opportunities for play. This paper compares public school kindergarten classrooms between 1998 and 2010 using two large, nationally representative data sets. We show substantial changes in each of the five dimensions considered: kindergarten teachers beliefs about school readiness, time spent on academic and nonacademic content, classroom organization, pedagogical approach, and use of standardized assessments. Kindergarten teachers in the later period held far higher academic expectations for children both prior to kindergarten entry and during the kindergarten year. They devoted more time to advanced literacy and math content, teacher-directed instruction, and assessment and substantially less time to art, music, science, and child-selected activities.

In your source slang is defined as informal and playful http://www.dictionary.com/browse/slang?s=t 
So if there is a slight variation to the term that is also widely used there's no credible body of the English language that is going to say which is the correct way.

<TEXT> Abstract

Polyethylene (PE) is the largest-volume synthetic polymer, and its chemical inertness makes its degradation by low-energy processes a challenging problem. We report a tandem catalytic cross alkane metathesis method for highly efficient degradation of polyethylenes under mild conditions. With the use of widely available, low-value, short alkanes (for example, petroleum ethers) as cross metathesis partners, different types of polyethylenes with various molecular weights undergo complete conversion into useful liquid fuels and waxes. This method shows excellent selectivity for linear alkane formation, and the degradation product distribution (liquid fuels versus waxes) can be controlled by the catalyst structure and reaction time. In addition, the catalysts are compatible with various polyolefin additives; therefore, common plastic wastes, such as postconsumer polyethylene bottles, bags, and films could be converted into valuable chemical feedstocks without any pretreatment.

<TEXT> Abstract

OBJECTIVE: The incidence of sports- and recreation-related concussions (SRRCs) in the United States is unknown. More than 44 million youth participate in sports annually, thus understanding the frequency of SRRCs in children is important on a population level. Our objective was to determine the number of SRRCs occurring annually among US youth 18 years old.

METHODS: We identified SRRCs using 3 national databases: MarketScan, National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, and National High School Sports Related Injury Surveillance System, Reporting Injury Online. We determined the number of SRRCs seen in health care settings (outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department) and SRRCs reported to certified high school athletic trainers (ATCs). We used these data and findings in recently published literature to generate a national estimate of SRRCs.

RESULTS: We estimate that between 1.1 and 1.9 million SRRCs occur annually in US children aged 18 years. Most children with SRRCs, 511590 to 1240972, were not seen in health care settings. Of children with SRRCs seen in health care settings, most were seen as outpatients with 377978 visits, compared with between 115479 and 166929 ED visits, and between 2886 and 4936 hospitalizations.

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the most accurate and precise estimate to date of the number of concussions among US children annually. SRRCs are a common injury in children. Providers in all health care settings need to be trained in concussion care. There is a need for better surveillance to enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of concussions in youth.

<TEXT> Totally feel you on this. I could take baby steps towards the completion of several things, but then those babies never grow up when I don't take the next step in raising it into something sustainable (the goal). A big issue comes if I aim towards completing a goal so much and give less attention to an already established source of income; then I have to stop my "passion project," and I forget about it until I get my main source of income on track again. By then I'm typically frustrated with the main source of income again, and have to start anew with my passion project. You start a little rusty, and it feels almost like you're starting from scratch. 

This is where rules like keeping your expenses down work real well. Which why I think it's easier at times for kids to really master whatever they want to do before worrying about paying bills with it. Kids can spend practically all their time mastering something if they live with parents who cover housing, clothing, food expenses, etc. But as an adult, as long as you can cover your expenses, you could still accomplish goals that you like working towards. So they key is keeping them down as much as possible and / or learning how to make money to cover your expenses with a very little resource and time requirement. 

The other thing is to also figure out a way to generate revenue from something you like even if you haven't mastered it yet to completely do it like you want to do it. Perhaps by helping other people do what you want to do by teaching them what you know. You'll always find people who know less than you about a certain subject. Teaching is also a great way for you to master your craft, for it helps you learn it quicker.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Background:

Little is known of the association between nut consumption, and prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and survivorship.

Methods:

We conducted an incidence analysis and a case-only survival analysis in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study on the associations of nut consumption (updated every 4 years) with PCa diagnosis, and PCa-specific and overall mortality.

Results:

In 26 years, 6810 incident PCa cases were identified from 47299 men. There was no association between nut consumption and being diagnosed with PCa or PCa-specific mortality. However, patients who consumed nuts five or more times per week after diagnosis had a significant 34% lower rate of overall mortality than those who consumed nuts less than once per month (HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.520.83, P-trend=0.0005).

Conclusions:

There were no statistically significant associations between nut consumption, and PCa incidence or PCa-specific mortality. Frequent nut consumption after diagnosis was associated with significantly reduced overall mortality.

<TEXT> Totally understand your concern. I would never let him solely game day in and day out, for he'll probably be gaming in my house until he's 50 if I let that happen.

He's "always" gaming during his free time (that's time he gets after homework, chores, exercise, shooting practice, and trick shots are done). If all of the above doesn't get done, then no gaming is allowed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for viewing. I totally get it, man. Our lesson from this was to try to identify what way of shooting the ball almost worked and make adjustments on power and throwing angles. So for anything in life, I think if you analyze what almost worked, and make a slight adjustment on your next try, you get closer to reaching your objective. I also had him mentally visualize getting the ball in the hoop. I really think that clear focus on the goal also gave him different ideas on how to get it done.

Edit: Just want to say, keep seeing the end result, and you'll get there! Forward! And thanks again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abstract

BackgroundCurrent findings on associations between whole grain (WG) intake and mortality are inconsistent and have not been summarized by meta-analysis.

Methods and ResultsWe searched for prospective cohort studies reporting associations between WG intake and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer through February 2016 in Medline, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov, and we further included unpublished results from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and NHANES 1999 to 2004. Fourteen studies were eligible for analysis, which included 786 076 participants, 97 867 total deaths, 23 957 CVD deaths, and 37 492 cancer deaths. Pooled relative risks comparing extreme WG categories (high versus low) were 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.800.88; P0.001; I2=74%; Pheterogeneity0.001) for total mortality, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.790.85; P0.001; I2=0%; Pheterogeneity=0.53) for CVD mortality, and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.830.94; P0.001; I2=54%; Pheterogeneity=0.02) for cancer mortality. Intakes of WG ingredients in dry weight were estimated among studies reporting relative risks for 3 quantitative WG categories, and they were 50 g/d among most study populations. The 2-stage dose-response random-effects meta-analysis showed monotonic associations between WG intake and mortality (Pnonlinearity0.05). For each 16-g/d increase in WG (1 serving per d), relative risks of total, CVD, and cancer mortality were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.920.94; P0.001), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.900.93; P0.001), and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.940.96; P0.001), respectively.

ConclusionsOur meta-analysis demonstrated inverse associations of WG intake with total and cause-specific mortality, and findings were particularly strong and robust for CVD mortality. These findings further support current Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which recommends at least 3 servings per day of WG intake.

<TEXT> Results

E-cigarette users and never users were similar on matching factors (gender, ethnicity, grade) and parental education. In adjusted models males were more likely to initiate cigarette use (OR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.043.26; Table 1). Adolescents who were classified as susceptible to cigarette use were more likely to report e-cigarette use at initial evaluation (OR = 2.48; 95% CI: 1.444.27) and to report cigarette use at follow-up (OR = 3.03; 95% CI: 1.715.39). Having one or more friends who smoked combustible tobacco products also increased the likelihood of e-cigarette use at initial evaluation (OR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.355.06) and cigarette use at follow-up (OR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.305.09); having friends who were friendly to cigarette use was associated with e-cigarette use at initial evaluation (OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.243.65) but not with cigarette use at follow-up. The median age of participants at initial evaluation was 17.4 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 16.817.9); median age at follow-up was 18.6 years (IQR: 18.319.0 years); median time from initial evaluation to follow-up was 15.6 months (IQR: 12.618.2 months).

TABLE 1
Demographic Characteristics of Participants by E-Cigarette Use at Initial Assessment and by Cigarette Use at Follow-up, N = 298

To assess the potential for selection bias, we compared sociodemographic characteristics of study participants for whom follow-up data were obtained with those lost to follow-up. Participants from whom follow-up data were collected were more likely to have a parent with at least a college education (Supplemental Table 5). No notable differences in gender, ethnicity, grade, or susceptibility to cigarette use were observed between retained participants and those lost to follow up.

Among never e-cigarette users at initial evaluation, 16 (10.5%) reported use of cigarettes at follow-up; among ever e-cigarette users at the initial evaluation, 59 (40.4%) reported use of cigarettes at follow-up (Table 2). The adjusted OR for the association of e-cigarette use with subsequent smoking of combustible cigarettes was 6.17 (95% CI: 3.3011.6). After further adjustment for cigar, pipe, or hookah use at initial evaluation, the association of e-cigarette use with subsequent smoking was slightly attenuated but still statistically significant (OR = 5.48; 95% CI: 2.6911.2). Results did not differ appreciably after additional adjustment for social environment characteristics at initial evaluation (whether others in the home smoked, number of friends who smoked, friends attitudes toward smoking), age at initial evaluation, age at follow-up, or time in months from initial evaluation to follow-up (results not shown). E-cigarette users had 5.49 times (95% CI: 2.6811.2) the odds of initiating cigarette smoking but not having smoked in the past 30 days, and 7.50 times (95% CI: 2.4123.4) the odds of reporting use of cigarettes in the past 30 days at follow-up compared with never e-cigarette users. Estimates were based on 39 (27.1%) initiators and 18 (12.5%) past 30-day cigarette users among e-cigarette users at baseline, compared with 12 (7.9%) initiators and 4 (2.6%) past 30-day cigarette users among never e-cigarette users at baseline; 2 participants reported initiation of smoking but did not report the number of days smoked in the past 30 days (results not tabulated).


Association Between E-Cigarette Use at Initial Assessment in 2014 and Subsequent Cigarette Use at Follow-up in 2015

Among adolescents who were not classified as susceptible to cigarette use at initial evaluation, 36.2% (n = 34) of e-cigarette users and 5.7% (n = 7) of never e-cigarette users reported initiation of cigarettes at follow up (ORnot susceptible = 9.69; 95% CI: 4.0223.4; Table 3). In contrast, among those who were classified as susceptible to smoking at initial evaluation, e-cigarette users were only slightly more likely to initiate cigarette use at follow-up (47.1% v. 32.1%; ORsusceptible = 2.12; 95% CI: 0.79, 5.74; interaction P = .03). We also examined interactions of e-cigarette use at initial evaluation with gender, ethnicity, grade level, time from initial contact to completion of follow-up questionnaire, and use of hookah at initial evaluation. The risk of initiation of cigarette use associated with e-cigarettes did not differ by these characteristics.

Association Between E-Cigarette Use at Initial Assessment in 2014 and Subsequent Cigarette Use at Follow-up in 2015 by Indication of Susceptibility to Smoking at Initial Evaluation

In an analysis restricted to those who reported no use of any combustible tobacco product at initial evaluation, e-cigarette users were also more likely to initiate use of any combustible tobacco product at follow-up (OR = 4.98; 95% CI: 2.3710.4; Table 4) and to initiate use of cigarettes (OR = 4.29; 95% CI: 1.8410.0), hookah (OR = 2.86; 95% CI: 1.216.78), cigars (OR = 4.39; 95% CI: 1.7211.2), and pipes (OR = 8.21; 95% CI: 1.2056.2).

<TEXT> Summary
Background
Major depressive disorder is one of the most common mental disorders in children and adolescents. However, whether to use pharmacological interventions in this population and which drug should be preferred are still matters of controversy. Consequently, we aimed to compare and rank antidepressants and placebo for major depressive disorder in young people.

Methods
We did a network meta-analysis to identify both direct and indirect evidence from relevant trials. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LiLACS, regulatory agencies' websites, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind randomised controlled trials up to May 31, 2015, for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder in children and adolescents. We included trials of amitriptyline, citalopram, clomipramine, desipramine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, imipramine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Trials recruiting participants with treatment-resistant depression, treatment duration of less than 4 weeks, or an overall sample size of less than ten patients were excluded. We extracted the relevant information from the published reports with a predefined data extraction sheet, and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcomes were efficacy (change in depressive symptoms) and tolerability (discontinuations due to adverse events). We did pair-wise meta-analyses using the random-effects model and then did a random-effects network meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework. We assessed the quality of evidence contributing to each network estimate using the GRADE framework. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015016023.

Findings
We deemed 34 trials eligible, including 5260 participants and 14 antidepressant treatments. The quality of evidence was rated as very low in most comparisons. For efficacy, only fluoxetine was statistically significantly more effective than placebo (standardised mean difference 051, 95% credible interval [CrI] 099 to 003). In terms of tolerability, fluoxetine was also better than duloxetine (odds ratio [OR] 031, 95% CrI 013 to 095) and imipramine (023, 004 to 078). Patients given imipramine, venlafaxine, and duloxetine had more discontinuations due to adverse events than did those given placebo (549, 196 to 2086; 319, 101 to 1870; and 280, 120 to 942, respectively). In terms of heterogeneity, the global I2 values were 3321% for efficacy and 0% for tolerability.

Interpretation
When considering the riskbenefit profile of antidepressants in the acute treatment of major depressive disorder, these drugs do not seem to offer a clear advantage for children and adolescents. Fluoxetine is probably the best option to consider when a pharmacological treatment is indicated.

Funding
National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program).

<TEXT> Abstract

BACKGROUND: Food and beverage marketing has been associated with childhood obesity. We quantified the number and type of food or beverage brands promoted by music celebrities, assessed the nutritional quality of the products, and examined Teen Choice Award data to assess the celebrities popularity among adolescents.

METHODS: This was a descriptive study. A list of music celebrities associated with the 2013 and 2014 Billboard Hot 100 Chart, which ranks songs according to sales and radio impressions, was compiled. Data on celebrity endorsements were gathered from official company Web sites, YouTube commercials, an advertising database, and media reports. Nutritional quality of foods was assessed according to the Nutrient Profile Index, whereas nonalcoholic beverages were evaluated based on calories from added sugar. Teen Choice Award nominations were used to measure the celebrities popularity among adolescents.

RESULTS: Of the 590 endorsements made by the 163 celebrities in the sample, consumer goods (eg, fragrances, makeup) represented the largest endorsement category (26%), followed by food and beverage (18%) and retail (11%). Sixty-five celebrities were collectively associated with 57 different food and beverage brands owned by 38 parent companies. Of these 65 celebrities, 53 (81.5%) had 1 Teen Choice Award nomination. Forty-nine (71%) of the 69 nonalcoholic beverage references promoted sugar-sweetened beverages. Twenty-one (80.8%) of the 26 endorsed foods were energy dense and nutrient poor. Baauer, will.i.am, Justin Timberlake, Maroon 5, and Britney Spears had the most food and beverage endorsements.

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that music celebrities who are popular among adolescents endorse energy-dense, nutrient-poor products.

<TEXT> Importance  After major policy changes in the United States, policymakers, health care professionals, and the general public seek information about whether recreational cannabis use is associated with physical health problems later in life.

Objective  To test associations between cannabis use over 20 years and a variety of physical health indexes at early midlife.

Design, Setting, and Participants  Participants belonged to a representative birth cohort of 1037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972 and 1973 and followed to age 38 years, with 95% retention (the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study). We tested whether cannabis use from ages 18 to 38 years was associated with physical health at age 38, even after controlling for tobacco use, childhood health, and childhood socioeconomic status. We also tested whether cannabis use from ages 26 to 38 years was associated with within-individual health decline using the same measures of health at both ages.

Exposures  We assessed frequency of cannabis use and cannabis dependence at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures  We obtained laboratory measures of physical health (periodontal health, lung function, systemic inflammation, and metabolic health), as well as self-reported physical health, at ages 26 and 38 years.

Results  The 1037 study participants were 51.6% male (n = 535). Of these, 484 had ever used tobacco daily and 675 had ever used cannabis. Cannabis use was associated with poorer periodontal health at age 38 years and within-individual decline in periodontal health from ages 26 to 38 years. For example, cannabis joint-years from ages 18 to 38 years was associated with poorer periodontal health at age 38 years, even after controlling for tobacco pack-years ( = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05-0.18; P .001). Additionally, cannabis joint-years from ages 26 to 38 years was associated with poorer periodontal health at age 38 years, even after accounting for periodontal health at age 26 years and tobacco pack-years ( = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05-0.16; P .001) However, cannabis use was unrelated to other physical health problems. Unlike cannabis use, tobacco use was associated with worse lung function, systemic inflammation, and metabolic health at age 38 years, as well as within-individual decline in health from ages 26 to 38 years.

Conclusions and Relevance  Cannabis use for up to 20 years is associated with periodontal disease but is not associated with other physical health problems in early midlife.

<TEXT> Importance  Late-term gestation (defined as the 41st week of pregnancy) is associated with increased risk of perinatal health complications. It is not known to what extent late-term gestation is associated with long-term cognitive and physical outcomes. Information about long-term outcomes may influence physician and patient decisions regarding optimal pregnancy length.

Objective  To compare the cognitive and physical outcomes of school-aged children who were born full term or late term.

Design, Setting, and Participants  We analyzed Florida birth certificates from 1994 to 2002 linked to Florida public school records from 1998 to 2013 and found 1 442 590 singleton births with 37 to 41 weeks gestation in the Florida Bureau of Vital Statistics. Of these, 1 153 716 children (80.0%) were subsequently located in Florida public schools. Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association of gestational age with cognitive and physical outcomes at school age. Data analysis took place between April 2013 and January 2016.

Exposures  Late-term (born at 41 weeks) vs full-term (born at 39 or 40 weeks) gestation.

Main Outcomes and Measures  There were a number of measures used, including the average Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test mathematics and reading scores at ages 8 through 15 years; whether a child was classified as gifted, defined as a student with superior intellectual development and capable of high performance; poor cognitive outcome, defined as a child scoring in the fifth percentile of test takers or having a disability that exempted him or her from taking the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test; and Exceptional Student Education placement owing to orthopedic, speech, or sensory impairment or being hospitalbound or homebound.

Results  Of 1 536 482 children born in Florida from singleton births from 1994 to 2002 with complete demographic information, 787 105 (51.2%) were male; 338 894 (22.1%) of mothers were black and 999 684 (65.1%) were married at time of birth, and the mean (SD) age for mothers at time of birth was 27.2 (6.2) years. Late-term infants had 0.7% of an SD (95% CI, 0.001-0.013; P = .02) higher average test scores in elementary and middle school, 2.8% (95% CI, 0.4-5.2; P = .02) higher probability of being gifted, and 3.1% (95% CI, 0.0-6.1; P = .05) reduced probability of poor cognitive outcomes compared with full-term infants. These cognitive benefits appeared strongest for children with disadvantaged family background characteristics. Late-term infants were also 2.1% (95% CI, 0.3 to 4.5; P = .08) more likely to be physically impaired.

Conclusions and Relevance  There appears to be a tradeoff between cognitive and physical outcomes associated with late-term gestation. Children born late-term performed better on 3 measures of school-based cognitive functioning but worse on 1 measure of physical functioning relative to children born full term. Our findings provide longer-run information for expectant parents and physicians who are considering delivery at full term vs late term. These findings are most relevant to uncomplicated, low-risk pregnancies.

<TEXT>  Increasing evidence from laboratory and epidemiologic studies indicates that insufficient sleep may be a risk factor for obesity. Sleep curtailment results in stimulation of hunger and food intake that exceeds the energy cost of extended wakefulness, suggesting the involvement of reward mechanisms. The current study tested the hypothesis that sleep restriction is associated with activation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system, a key component of hedonic pathways involved in modulating appetite and food intake.

<TEXT> Thanks for the remarks. I could see how that may help some children; however, my son loves being on video. We're actually developing a series of his toy unboxings and game plays. 

That said, without the camera up, he didn't even want to shoot the ball. I filmed his first attempts, and noticed he got a little more motivated, but he was still failing, so I thought he might do better without it. I turned it off. As soon as I dropped the phone, he stopped shooting and the first thing he said was, "Is the camera rolling?"

"It is now," I said, as I lifted it and cut it back on. Then he started to try again, and the footage to which I link here is what we got. 

Further, on this other video, I actually got him to do good in school by telling him that I would be filming him when [he got out of school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny3gRqIxNgk).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand where you are coming from. I saw a documentary on Netflix that actually highlighted parents who were obsessed that their children did well at sports. They were verbally and physically abusive with the kids when they didn't perform well. And they forced them to practice like full-time jobs. That said, I'm trying to be real careful to not be like that. Further, I work a lot of hours, so I may not even have the time to be like that. 

My ultimate objective is not that my sons become the next Michael Jordans, I just want them to be more active because as human beings, I think we have to be active to stay healthy. I would be satisfied that they get good enough to like to play basketball or another sport enough that he stays fit. If they get good and go on to play at a collegiate, pro or other good formal level, then I'll support them. 

For instance, I work out 6 days a week myself. My uncle would force me to workout a few times a week when I was nine years old with small weights. I didn't utterly love it at first, for I was lazy. But I have had a love/hate relationship for workouts since that I've rarely lived years of my life without some type of daily workout or sports involvement. And not to brag (which means I'm about to brag), at 40 I am literally stronger than I was at 18, aside from the minor knee pain and muscle pulls that I didn't suffer at that age. Overall, I strongly think that push to get involved with weights at age nine gave me the drive to eat better and be a overall healthy guy for my age. Otherwise, I would have stuck to playing G.I.Joe and Super Mario until the calluses on my thumbs bled (had the calluses but never bled :). 

Thanks for the remarks. Further, I think we're off to a good start, for after this, he told me that being a basketball player was among the other things he wanted to be when he grows up (foot surgeon, military medic, a few others I forgot). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great story. Sounds like your mom loved you so much she didn't want you to get hurt. My mother was overprotective too, who also stopped me from doing more slightly "risky" activities. Great job on overcoming all the chaos around you to still do your thing.

We've also played with smaller balls in the pool where's he's made some shots. But your story reminds me of something Vince Carter said before about using bigger basketballs. If I recall correctly, he said he practiced with a bigger ball than the regulation ball to get better at shooting and dribbling. I may explore trying that to see what it helps produce. Thanks for the thought! </TEXT>

<TEXT> An analysis of return on investment can help policy makers support, optimize, and advocate for the expansion of immunization programs in the worlds poorest countries. We assessed the return on investment associated with achieving projected coverage levels for vaccinations to prevent diseases related to ten antigens in ninety-four low- and middle-income countries during 201120, the Decade of Vaccines. We derived these estimates by using costs of vaccines, supply chains, and service delivery and their associated economic benefits. Based on the costs of illnesses averted, we estimated that projected immunizations will yield a net return about 16 times greater than costs over the decade (uncertainty range: 1025). Using a full-income approach, which quantifies the value that people place on living longer and healthier lives, we found that net returns amounted to 44 times the costs (uncertainty range: 2767). Across all antigens, net returns were greater than costs. But to realize the substantial positive return on investment from immunization programs, it is essential that governments and donors provide the requisite investments.

And movies that I saw which I wouldn't mind leaving on in the background while I'm doing something else, like the Bourne flicks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Though common sense suggests that positive thinking shelters people from depression, the four studies reported here showed that this intuition needs to be qualified: Positive thinking in the form of fantasies about the future did indeed relate to decreased symptoms of depression when measured concurrently; however, positive fantasies predicted more depressive symptoms when measured longitudinally. The pattern of results was observed for different indicators of fantasies and depression, in adults and in schoolchildren, and for periods of up to 7 months (Studies 14). In college students, low academic success partially mediated the predictive relation between positive fantasies and symptoms of depression (Study 4). Results add to existing research on the problematic effects of positive fantasies on performance by suggesting that indulging in positive fantasies predicts problems in mental health.

<TEXT> Endurance athletes commonly ingest caffeine as a means to enhance training intensity and competitive performance. A widely-used source of caffeine is coffee, however conflicting evidence exists regarding the efficacy of coffee in improving endurance performance. In this context, the aims of this evidence-based review were three-fold: 1) to evaluate the effects of pre-exercise coffee on endurance performance, 2) to evaluate the effects of coffee on perceived exertion during endurance performance, and 3) to translate the research into usable information for athletes to make an informed decision regarding the intake of caffeine via coffee as a potential ergogenic aid. Searches of three major databases were performed using terms caffeine, and coffee, or coffee-caffeine, and endurance, or aerobic. Included studies (n=9) evaluated the effects of caffeinated coffee on human subjects, provided the caffeine dose administered, administered caffeine 45 minutes before testing, and included a measure of endurance performance (e.g., time trial). Significant improvements in endurance performance were observed in five of nine studies, which were on average 24.2% over controls for time to exhaustion trials, and 3.1% for time to completion trials. Three of six studies found that coffee reduced perceived exertion during performance measures significantly more than control conditions (p0.05). Based on the reviewed studies there is moderate evidence supporting the use of coffee as an ergogenic aid to improve performance in endurance cycling and running. Coffee providing 3-8.1mg/kg (1.36-3.68mg/lb) of caffeine may be used as a safe alternative to anhydrous caffeine to improve endurance performance.

<TEXT> Background Premature cardiac contractions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Though experts associate premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with caffeine, there are no data to support this relationship in the general population. As certain caffeinated products may have cardiovascular benefits, recommendations against them may be detrimental.

Even if you're performing an exercise incorrectly, it's good to film yourself, so you could see how you're messing up your form, and apply the appropriate corrections.

<TEXT> With all due respect, Meepster23, I have not fabricated anything I've written. I told you, I have at times deleted my submissions to edit a title; and reposted it afterwards. However, I have never done it to circumvent your systems or for any other reasons that violate the r/videos or Reddit guidelines. 

And again, the only reason I created a new channel was because I want to start uploading my videos about my fictitious character that I've had in my hard drive and thought was funny. You could clearly see, the video is fictitious story about a guy who hogs up the TV and gets beat down by his kids for 18 months. I even titled the channel Couch Potato. Nothing in my original channel is fictitious; where do you see any reference to a couch potato in my original channel? I didn't do it to bypass any system; otherwise, I would have uploaded today's video to this other channel which didn't get removed. 

This is the first time a mod told me that my channel was not being accepted or "spammed," which I believe is incorrect because submissions to my channel constitute a very small proportion of the entire body of my Reddit submission history. So what's the motive behind me creating a channel to bypass the system?

The bottom line is that submissions to any of my channels (cross posted or not) constitute far less than 10 percent of my submissions to Reddit.com. So how am I not participating "beyond what is necessary?" Further, why is the gap so relevant? I have been very busy the past few years with work and have finally found time to do some of the things I like such as contributing to Reddit with content from all corners of the web, and sometimes uploading a video I do with the wife and kids. Look at how much time I have spent on Reddit submitting content from a WIDE variety of sources. I feel so satisfied that I am able to serve the people of Reddit with information that truly matters to our lives and the planet's progress; not only created by me but by the every other content creator I could find.

Again, I sincerely appreciate your responsiveness with this issue, Meepster23. Thank you for checking it out.

<TEXT> Thank you for taking the time to review this issue, Meepster23.

I created that channel because there is a different theme to it. It was a crazy idea that I had about featuring the adventures of a couch potato. I didn't see it as being relevant to my primary channel (a channel I primarily use for the real adventures I go through with my family - Couch Potato is a fictitious character), which is why I published it on Couch Potato; I have more videos with that theme, I just haven't had time to upload them all. How am I gaming the system? Is it illegal or against the terms of service to have another YouTube channel? Further, I cross post multiple links most of which are not my own; and so do many Redditors. 

I have deleted submissions in the past because Reddit doesn't allow me to edit my titles; but I always repost the content with a corrected title. I even originally deleted this one because my title was grammatically incorrect, and I didn't want attention to be directed to that unimportant detail. Is deleting a submission such a crime or is it against the terms of service? If I am not allowed to delete submissions, why do we even get that option as users? Am I only supposed to delete a submission with moderator approval?

Thank you again for your time.

<TEXT> I've heard of people going through that, but I'm not sure it would work for everybody. My brother-n-law and I went to this slide that explicitly required participants to be strong swimmers, for you would be diving into about 20 feet of water. My brother-n-law couldn't swim, and he told me he wasn't going. I told him to wait for me by the exit. I slide down, swim to the edge. 

As I'm walking to the exit, I hear whistles blowing and lifeguards diving into the water. My brother-n-law, probably feeling challenged that (a guy who's like 16 years older), got in the slide after he said he wouldn't. After frantically crashing his arms on the water and unable to get afloat, the lifeguards had to pull him out half-passed out. You could see his arms straightened and stiff as they draped his right armpit on a life preserver. He took a knee for a few minutes, spitting and blowing out water from his nostrils and mouth. Not sure if he would have made it, if they would have left him in there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> DNA sense-and-respond protein modules for mammalian cells

We generated synthetic protein components that can detect specific DNA sequences and subsequently trigger a desired intracellular response. These modular sensors exploit the programmability of zinc-finger DNA recognition to drive the intein-mediated splicing of an artificial trans-activator that signals to a genetic circuit containing a given reporter or response gene. We used the sensors to mediate sequence recognitioninduced apoptosis as well as to detect and report a viral infection. This work establishes a synthetic biology framework for endowing mammalian cells with sentinel capabilities, which provides a programmable means to cull infected cells. It may also be used to identify positively transduced or transfected cells, isolate recipients of intentional genomic edits and increase the repertoire of inducible parts in synthetic biology.

Other YouTubers have gone mainstream with some success, nonetheless; I know a guy who just got his own VH1 show and was getting brand sponsorships for $60K a piece when he was doing YouTube vids for an audience of about 1 million. He worked with an agency, nonetheless, that brokered his deals effectively; he told me. So you just have to patient and carefully read anything in which your involving yourself; and definitely don't give the rooster the keys to the hen house. Hope all goes well for her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This day I had taken a job delivering produce in Long Island, and I saw the news broadcasting the smoke rising out of the hole in the first building that was hit in a pizza shop as I was delivering tomatoes. I told the pizza shop worker that it was probably an accident, and that it would be fixed right away. He told me that the reporters were already speculating that it was terrorism. 

Once I returned to the warehouse, the radio broadcaster said that the World Trade Center is no more, and that a plane crashed in the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. The owner of the warehouse lent us a delivery van to drive back to Queens, for the train service was shut down, and I didn't bring my car. It took me and two or three fellow employees several hours to get to Queens (a ride which typically takes only 20 minutes or so). There was traffic on practically every street we drove on. People were driving up the opposite way out of the entrance ramp to exit the highway. Squad cars and ambulances struggled to make their way through bumper to bumper stuck traffic. 

Once I returned to Queens, I spoke to a few people in my old neighborhood on Jamaica, and traffic was just as bad. I walked home, about a mile away, showered and picked up my friends in my Mitsubishi. We drove straight to Brooklyn. We wanted to walk over the bridge to see what happened, but it was blocked. People were only allowed to exit. 

So from Dumbo, Brooklyn here are the images I managed to capture on the afternoon of September 11, 2001. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prions are proteins that assume alternate shapes that become self-propagating, and while some prions perform normal physiological functions, others cause disease. Prions were discovered while studying the cause of rare neurodegenerative diseases of animals and humans called scrapie and CreutzfeldtJakob disease, respectively. We report here the discovery of -synuclein prions that cause a more common neurodegenerative disease in humans called multiple system atrophy (MSA). In contrast to MSA, brain extracts from Parkinsons disease (PD) patients were not transmissible to genetically engineered cells or mice, although much evidence argues that PD is also caused by -synuclein, suggesting that this strain (or variant) is different from those that cause MSA.

<TEXT> Four years ago, Seitz and his then teammates at Real Salt Lake -- along with hundreds of others in the tightly-knit MLS family -- registered to become bone marrow donors. It was a show of solidarity for Salt Lake midfielder Andy Williams' wife, Marcia, who was battling a rare form of leukemia.

In the years since, Seitz would receive a monthly newsletter from DKMS, the bone marrow center where he registered, and would delete it. But this email was different. This email involved a total stranger who needed help.

The email had come from DKMS, the largest bone marrow donor center in the world.

The email explained that Seitz's name had appeared in the center's database as a potential match for a dying patient. It asked him to contact them as soon as possible if he wanted to help. 

In 2008, Seitz had been in his second year with Real Salt Lake when he watched the wife of popular teammate Andy Williams struggle with her own leukemia fight. The disease is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Marcia was the reason Seitz had agreed to have one of his cheeks swabbed to join the registry. She was the reason he had once worn a faded green "Soccer Unites Utah" wristband.

Now he found himself on the phone with a DKMS representative, listening to the woman explain that, if he was interested, he might have the opportunity to help save someone like Uncle John or Marcia.

DKMS told Seitz that because of the type of cancer his recipient had, the less invasive donation procedure his dad went through wasn't an option. Instead, Seitz would require surgery in which doctors would poke two holes in his lower back, then fish 32 needles through each of those holes to remove fresh marrow from the core of Seitz's bones. Doctors would then inject that marrow into the recipient.

For an average 25-year-old, the procedure might mean a few days of discomfort and a week or two of decreased activity. For a professional goalkeeper, who makes a living diving on the exact bones where the marrow would be extracted, the situation was far more precarious.

As Seitz sat in recovery eating crushed ice and sipping apple juice, his nurses explained that everything had gone according to plan. The doctors had successfully poked the 64 holes in the bones in his lower back and harvested ample amounts of bone marrow to give to his recipient. Although the two incisions looked no larger than the tip of a pen cap, his body was exhausted. It was a struggle to move himself from the stretcher to a permanent hospital bed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By the summer of 1885 the Statue of Liberty was in New York in pieces, awaiting assembly.

Designed by French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and paid for by the government of France, the statue was a diplomatic gift to the US. However, the US had been unable to raise $250,000 for a granite plinth for the statue - around $6.3m (4.1m) at today's prices.

A group called the American Committee of the Statue of Liberty was tasked with raising the money but fell short by more than a third.

New York Governor Grover Cleveland rejected the use of city funds to pay for 
it, and Congress could not agree on a funding package.

Amid the uncertainty, Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco and Philadelphia offered to pay for the pedestal in return for the statue's relocation.

It seemed as though New York had run out of options when renowned publisher Joseph Pulitzer decided to launch a fundraising campaign in his newspaper The New York World.

Image of the Statue of Liberty printed in The New York World newspaper
The campaign was given front-page treatment in The World

The campaign eventually raised money from more than 160,000 donors, including young children, businessmen, street cleaners and politicians, with more than three-quarters of the donations amounting to less than a dollar.

It was a triumphant rescue effort: in just five months The World raised $101,091 - enough to cover the last $100,000 to complete the pedestal and have money leftover for a gift for the sculptor

A successful crowdfunding campaign before the term was coined.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  My uncle and I built a kite on which Reddit's Snoo finally flew. Here's the story. When I was about 7 or 8 years old, my mother bought me a kite from a supermarket for a couple of bucks. I didn't know how to fly it that well, and it got caught up with something and ripped. My grandfather had just immigrated from Colombia, where building and flying kites is like learning to ride a bike: everybody does it. He patched up the kite, and flew it so high that I could barely see it; he used up all of the line to which it was attached. 

His son, my uncle, and I built a few kites almost 20 years ago; the last one we built was shaped into a Mickey Mouse. It was too heavy and did not fly. We took it apart and pasted Mickey flat on the kite. That one flew. This year we built one with Reddit's Snoo pasted on it and got a license from Reddit to use it. We ran into some issues making it fly, but we finally got it up. </TEXT>

 But with the fix appearing to be in, contest organizers eventually removed Horace Mann from consideration.

While Taylor Swift wont be playing a concert there, the singer has offered to personally donate $10,000 to the school  a donation which was quickly matched by contest sponsors Papa Johns and Chegg, a textbook company. American Greetings and Cover Girl got in on the act, upping the schools windfall to $50,000; VH1s Save the Music program added an additional $10,000 worth of instruments.

For those students disappointed they wont get a Swift concert at their campus, Taylor has offered free tickets to any Horace Mann student for her next Boston concert. </TEXT>

 Dashrath Manjhi carved a path 360-foot-long (110 m) through-cut, 25-foot-deep (7.6 m) in places and 30-foot-wide (9.1 m) to form a road[6] through the rocks in the Gehlour hill.

<TEXT>  The first alternator to produce alternating current was a dynamo electric generator based on Michael Faraday's principles constructed by the French instrument maker Hippolyte Pixii in 1832.[4] Pixii later added a commutator to his device to produce the (then) more commonly used direct current.

 In 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional AC motor, something these systems had lacked up till then. The design, an induction motor, was independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla (with Tesla's design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  However, in most instances, the machines appeared to have been able to distinguish the fake bills from the real ones, and separate them. A Chase bank official said that the canisters designed to snare bogus bills for this purpose in the A.T.M.s were full of them.

Shouldn't the ATM's shut themselves down when they are unable to identify any more fake bills? Good thing these were bad counterfeits. 

 The bills were made from ordinary paper stock and were blank on one side.

Otherwise, they may have walked away with the fakes and put them into circulation or encountered problems trying to change the money for real bills.

It's funny, sometimes I question whether to count my money before I leave an ATM. What makes me do it, nonetheless, is that I used to work at a bank, and every once in a while people would step to the teller complaining that the ATM dispensed the wrong amount of money.

<TEXT> It's a sarcastic statement, deeming the act of releasing their medical records unnecessary. 

 Along with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryans tax returns, the Romney campaign released letters from both mens physicians this afternoon that reveal more than probably anyone ever wanted to know about the Republican presidential candidate and his running mate. These medical records include information on how much Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan weigh, their exercise routines and what drugs they are on. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The threat to the country is in NOT changing the platform, which is what he was saying, which is what I said he was saying...

Where in the video does he say that "NOT changing the (Republican) platform" is a threat to the country? Can you read the transcript with me?


Here's what the audience member asked prior to Romney giving that response:
 Years and years ago, I called George Bush Sr., and he had helped me in my campaign in Massachusetts when I ran for Senate. I told him that there's a guy named Clinton who's running for the following reasons. And he laughed. Right now, I'm very concernedWomen would not want to be involved for you. Hispanics, majority of them do not want to vote for you.


Wasn't this audience member questioning the idea of supporting Romney because women and Hispanics don't support him? Wouldn't the audience member or any practical business person for that matter think that a Romney contribution be a bad investment if this was so? Read on...


Romney's remarks after the response in the article:
 We have some greatwe have some great Hispanic leaders in our party who will help communicate what our party stands for, and what I think, frankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars...


Isn't Romney trying to convince the audience members that he is aligned with Hispanic GOP leaders who will better identify with Hispanics and communicate the *existing* GOP platform? He wants money by any means. Where does he allude to lack of change to the platform as the national threat? 


Further, why do the leaders have to be Hispanic? Shouldn't the GOP platform stand on it's own merits without having be be communicated by a member of the Hispanic community to cater to Hispanics? Doesn't this logic show that he theorizes that he can get the Hispanic vote by showing off his "Hispanic leaders?" Does he think that that the audience members share his belief that the reason that Blacks and Hispanics don't identify with him is because he is white? He doesn't give one specific reason why Hispanics or blacks should support him other than saying he'll get their vote by showing off his ethnic allies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If 85%+ Hispanics vote for Democrats, wouldn't that persuade the GOP to structure their platform in a way that better addresses this community's needs and the country's as a whole? If the GOP restructure their platform to cater to what is the fastest growing population in the country, then wouldn't the Democrats also be forced to do a better job campaigning and running this country? How would this outcome be a threat to the nation? 

It's kind of like saying, if Usain Bolt keeps beating our runners in the Olympics, that's a threat to the nation. No! It forces United States runners to get faster, and beat or get closer to beating him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How is it bad for the country if certain communities vote for the party and candidate that addresses their issues? This is a free democracy. The whole point of voting is to support positions for which you stand. The idea is to elect leadership that will institute policy that can *help* solve your problems. If members of your community voted for the GOP because they clearly addressed the issues of your community, and you shared your community's views, would you vote for Democrats just so you could give the other candidate an unmerited chance of winning? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many African Americans and Hispanics are committed to the Democrats because Democrats address the issues involving those communities, like Obama's support of the Dream Act. Romney clearly stated that he would veto the Dream Act if he were president, while stating that he would offer the same provisions, such as permanent residency to illegal immigrants who honorably served in the military. Would Romney veto the Dream Act just because the Democratic nominee supports it?

How is it a threat to a nation if minority communities are voting for the party that addresses their issues? Would you vote for somebody if they stand against what you believe, just so you could give the other guy an unmerited chance? 

Democratic leadership is not uncontested. Obama didn't win and will not win 100% of the vote. He won and will win because a majority of the country thinks that he is the best man for the job. Romney and the GOP have brought this on themselves.  </TEXT>

Even if you were to add the 844,000 people that are not actively looking for work, and classified as discouraged workers who are not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them, you only get a total of 13,344,000. And if you add the total 2.6 million people who have not searched for work in the 4 weeks before the U.S. Labor Department count, but searched for work during the preceding 12 months, you only get a number of 15.1 million.* </TEXT>

When you get the list, you find out that you need a composition book. Or if you buy a college ruled composition book, there were times when you needed a wide-ruled composition book, so the teacher didn't have to strain his eyes. There are countless more examples that I could cite.

As noted previously, your best bet is not to guess what supplies you need. Grab a small note pad and a pencil for your first day; then either write down what you need or wait for a list of required supplies or syllabus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'm not sure if that has to do with matriarchal vs. patriarchal business models; however, what I can write is that Latin American countries, in some cases provide more off days than the U.S. Some employees get a few days off for festivities during carnivals. There is also a holy week that allows for days off or early dismissals for some. For instance, in the Colombian city of Barranquilla, the day after the city's soccer team won the national championship, they declared the day a citywide holiday, and many people were given the day off. Almost the same level of leave was afforded when one of their biggest singers died last year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> indeed; however, I'm not sure Batman could actually win that match; at least not in a hand-to-hand engagement. Captain America was injected with Super Serum, which made him a baby Hulk. Batman would have had to pull some serious strength debilitating biological warfare out of his utility belt to counteract the serum. Unless that's was the filmmaker's intent when Batman let loose that plume of smoke.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Limited down to both of your choices, I think the hatred of losing is more powerful. The desire to overcome fear, nonetheless, is a powerful driving force. You can say that I don't want fear to conquer me; and that's another way of avoiding a loss; so I still agree with you. And you're right; sometimes a win is like "woo hoo," without the exclamation; and we're out on the hunt for the next win. 

But it does feel good to win! My eyes well up with tears sometimes when a win is hard fought or a long time in the making. So it's hard to say.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> maybe it was the time when that Brazilian stripper i picked up (no, i didn't pay her) in miami was undulating her torso and grinding her vagina against my groin while my penis was in her. I could typically hold my ejaculation well when a woman rode me. however, she was better than any body with whom I had been. She reached behind her butt and gently massaged my scrotum as she rode. That did it for me. I got that quick ticklish feeling rise up my penis prior to ejac, and, at age 21 or 22, I didn't know every one of my holding tricks I know now, so I splashed. I've had a few more nice ones; like this girl that made me shake performing oral on her futon; and another who bought me a sausage and pepper hero and went down on me in the bathroom before many reps of behind the back standing thrusting in the shower. I think I enjoyed a few favorites.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the verdict I found an online parenting magazine:

"a study conducted by the University of New York in Albany reported that semen acts as a natural antidepressant (for both men and women). The semen acts like an injection of antidepressant that gets absorbed by the vaginal tissue and goes directly into the bloodstream, thus reducing depression. Semen may also lower blood pressure in women."
