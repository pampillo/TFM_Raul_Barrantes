[About REEL Science](https://www.cmnh.org/reelscience)

**Cinema science vs. the facts**

Hollywood is known as the dream factorythe place where the best and brightest creative minds produce films that entertain, inspire and yeseven educate. But what happens when movie magic is made at the expense of scientific fact? Well watch films that tackle science on the silver screenfrom stoically serious blockbusters to outrageously campy cult classicsand hear from Museum experts as they put these movies under the microscope to determine what the filmmakers got right... and what is better classified as creative license. Join us on this sometimes shocking, often hilarious and always illuminating journey into Reel Science!

Reel Science takes place the first Wednesday of the month, from September through May, at a Cleveland Cinemas location.

<TEXT> Fun brings people in from out side temporarily, and brings young people here for college or even shorter periods of time, then they leave, this is not how a city is built unless of course you're Vegas ;). We are not...


A study from the Manhattan Institute says otherwise.

See this article: http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2015/08/manhattan_institute_study_laud.html


"Brain Gain in America's Shrinking Cities," a new report by Aaron Renn, released today by the institute, lists Cleveland as one of 28 metro areas that experienced a double-digit percentage increase in residents with a bachelor's degree or higher between 2000 and 2013.


One reason for the solid performance by the Cleveland metro area is an increase in young, highly educated workers. Renn found that between 2000 and 2013, Cleveland-Elyria gained 7,650 adults between the ages of 25 and 34 with college degrees or higher, an 8.9 percent increase.


Cleveland is not only keeping young people with college degrees; it is gaining them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Industrial runoff, agricultural runoff, iron in the water. Sewers emptied into the river pretty much unchecked in places. In the 1870's the mayor of Cleveland is quoted as saying the Cuyahoga was an open sewer flowing through the middle of the city. Today, thanks to the Clean Water Act, EPA, and Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, and countless unsung activists and concerned citizens, the Cuyahoga is cleaner than it has been in nearly two centuries. It is full of many pollution-sensitive species that would not have survived in the river of this photo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ice crystals are indeed a mineral. They have a classified crystal system based on the water molecule, and a characteristic chemical formula: H2O. Look it up on any mineral website or mineralogy textbook and you will see that ice is a mineral just as surely as quartz, copper, iron, plagioclase, hornblende, muscovite, or enstatite. Snowflakes *are* euhedral mineral crystals. I'm not making this up.


See:

http://www.minerals.net/mineral/ice.aspx

http://academic.emporia.edu/abersusa/go336/merhoff/


In geology, sediments are accumulations of individual rock and mineral particles. Sedimentation, the process of sediment accumulation, involves the transport of rock and mineral fragments in a fluid, followed by their subsequent deposition. Those fluids include liquid water and atmospheric gases, or air.


Sediments are sorted and classified first by particle *size*, then by particle *composition*. Sand is a sediment type defined as rock and mineral grains larger than silt and smaller than gravel. More precisely, particles having a diameter between 1/16 of a millimeter up to 2.0 millimeters. Geologists use a standardized scale, called the Phi Scale, to classify particles into a sediment group.

See:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_size

http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/charts/wentworth-1922-grain-size.html



Putting all this together: Ice crystals are deposited in large accumulations during sedimentation events controlled by planetary atmospheric conditions. Ice crystals are mineral grains. As minerals they fall under the regime of geologic nomenclature. Ice crystals fall into the 'sand' and 'granule' particle size range of the Phi Scale.


Science has nothing to do with it. You're saying: 1. Snow is minerals. 2. Sand is minerals. 3. Therefore, snow is sand. That is a logical fallacy.


It's all about science. I'm saying: 1. Ice crystals (snow) are indeed mineral crystals. 2. Sand is a size classification for rock and mineral particles. 3. Ice crystals fall under the sand and granule size range. That is a demonstrable scientific fact.


Sand is just a word that describes a particle size for rocks and minerals. Sand isn't just quartz grains at the beach. Look up garnet sand. Or shell sand. Or basalt sand. Calcium carbonate sand. Oolitic sand. Coral sand. Gypsum sand. Glass sand. Volcanic ash, etc., etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also featured on [WKYC's 6 things to do this weekend in Cleveland](http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/six-things-to-do-this-weekend-in-northeast-ohio-nov-12-13/350869022), Dinofest takes place at the [Cleveland Museum of Natural History](https://www.cmnh.org/).


This year, an amazing roster of dinosaur experts will be speaking on topics like reproductive behavior in the raptor-like dinosaur *Troodon formosus*, recreating cretaceous ecosystems using paleoecology, how *T. rex* grew up and transformed from a fleet-footed rebel to a titanic, 40-foot predator, and how artists reconstruct extinct animals and bring them to life in paintings. There will also be a workshop where you can learn to draw dinosaurs with famed paleoartist [Dr. Julius Csotonyi](http://csotonyi.com/).


The museum will also have special fossils on display for you to see and touch, and lots of family-friendly activities set up around the museum- like fossil casting, and fossil dig activities.

The speaker roster includes:

Dr. David Varricchio from Montana State University

Dr. Holly Woodward-Ballard from Oklahoma State University

Dr. Jordan Mallon from the Canadian Museum of Nature

Dr. Julius Csotonyi, paleo artist extraordinaire


This is all included in the cost of admission for the museum, so check it out! </TEXT>
