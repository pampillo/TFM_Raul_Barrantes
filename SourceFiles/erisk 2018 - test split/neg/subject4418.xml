Businesses need to compete price-wise, which is why Trump uses foreign workers and imported steel.

<TEXT> $90 million is an expensive now now. Assad couldn't care less about an airport. The airport was in use the following day. All Syrian aircraft were moved to a Russian airbase in Syria. It was useless without a followup plan. 

The Pakistan attack was also useless as it's a one time deal. At least it only cost $16 million. ISIS is all over the world. People who butcher others fear no one. Least of all Trump. They would love nothing more than a fight to the death.

Trump said he would be everyone's President. He should certainly listen to what scientists have to say. Do you consider coal dust in your water a good thing? How about pesticides being approved that cause autism and brain damage in children? Do you believe global warming is a hoax? 

Trump only is not listening, he's working to destroy all records scientists have collected. What's he afraid of, things like clean coal is a hoax?

Our kids future is at stake here, he better damn well listen.

These are not all scientists anymore than the woman's march was all women. </TEXT>

So far I have not seen a coherent position. He said he knew more than the generals then turned the decisions over to them. He said he had a great healthcare plan then turned that over to Ryan and the republican Congress. Sooner or later you'll see the BS artist that he is.

Defense funding was cut by the Republican sequester.

Now he says the largest tax cut in US history. LOL  His budget is DOA in Congress.

I agree it's early and he surely will fuck up a lot more. He's illiterate on most every subject.  How many Presidents have you seen scientists protest? ROFLMFAO </TEXT>

You understand that Trump was never going to put Clinton is prison, right? That was just a ploy to get his morons to vote for him. So was most all of his rhetoric. He never had a healthcare plan for all. He never had a plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days. He didn't know more than the Generals. Just how many lies are Trump supporters willing to buy?

He'll get crushed on tax reform because the jackass has no idea of the cost. Healthcare will fail again. It should be an interesting week. I'm certain you'll buy all his excuses for these failures. </TEXT>

No, the left Judges fucked up nothing. Trump fucked it up. Then after having a couple weeks to revise it he fucked it up again. He doesn't understand how things work. You can say it's a Muslim ban for years and then claim it isn't. This time around 2 judges squashed it. How long are you going to go around making excuses for this bozo? Trump said he had a secret plan to defeat iSIS in 30 days. He lied, and what Obama did has no relevance. Other than deporting a few people, he hasn't filled any campaign promises.

The cops wore what was given to them. </TEXT>

It was about healthcare, education and many many more things. You need to come to the realization Trump is hated.

So far he's fucked up healthcare, a travel ban and defeating ISIS. He said he had a secret plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days. He's just a billionaire full of hot air. He said he would deport only bad people then turned around and deported a father of 6 who owned a business for 20 years. </TEXT>

Obviously he didn't release them in total or we could have seen where the income came from.  If he released recent returns we could have seen he lied about how much he gave vets. Eventually a complete tax form will be leaked.

The attempt was to defect from his Russian scandal, which we haven't forgotten. Nice try though. </TEXT>

If he wants to reach out release them.

<TEXT> Most do not have insurance through their employer. That's becoming rare these days. He said healthcare for everyone, he's not even close.

Nothing about Flynn being a foreign agent was fake news. Trump's tweet about Obama was fake news. Trump ties to a Russian bank are not fake news. At one time Russian banks were the only banks who would lend him money.

 I'll have to see 6 months of Trump numbers before I give him credit. He did not inherit a mess as he has claimed.

His potential to ruin the economy lies with his tariffs, a subject he has not yet acted on.

He can't go a day without telling a lie his followers suck right up.

Sessions is in serious trouble.

5 states are suing over the travel ban. Protests take place everyday and will continue to until this clown resigns.  </TEXT>

Obama is out enjoying himself, something he well deserves.

Many felt Trump would not do what he said when they voted for him are now upset. The Protests are real.

Her crime was trying to see her grand-kids for the 1st time since the Iraq war. Reality is we prevented people for Iraq who aided in our war efforts, sending them home where they are endangered for helping the US military.

And we did all this for a ban the courts overruled because it was haplessly prepared and poorly thought out. </TEXT>

He will be impeached and it will come from his own party. They just need to get enough on him to be sure he can't come back at them. He's a vindictive little bastard who can't stand being wrong.

You seem to have a real problem with black folks.

Trump will be hit with protests everyday of his life, many from Republicans who have got the shits of him as well. 

Can't wait for him to fuck up our healthcare system. Even the cops are starting to turn on him as he does not represent them. </TEXT>

Yes, people would starve to death as amateur farmers. China could be joined by many countries. Again we are the second largest exporter in the world. Exports are critical to our country. Poor old Donald had to ask how a strong dollar affects them.

Our corporations will be hurt by the best minds going elsewhere. American workers are inferior. They lack a work ethic employers look for. There biggest worry is is it break time yet. You will be disappoint by the manufacturing jobs he brings, if any.

If anyone does return to the US they will bring the best workers in the highest paying jobs with them.

Be careful how many Mexicans you piss off, they pick your food off the vine. That next strawberry could be tainted and Trumps is cutting inspections. 

Fortunately, Trump will go down with Flynn and the Russians. This is something even the republicans care about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm familiar with the fact that Trump has greatly scaled back his tax cuts when confronted by advisers who explained economics to the man. Your cut won't even touch the inflation this man will cause.

Best thing he could do to change that is quit making his shit overseas. His plans will cripple US corporations if other countries retaliate.  Without exports our corporations won't survive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope, the number of strikes has decreased everywhere under Trump. They will decrease even further because Trump has caused their government to stop them without getting permission. That means no surprise strikes. By the time we get permission the target will be gone. That's what happens when you kill 30 innocent women and children during your strike.

Two courts have now ruled against him. Only 1 was from Seattle. Trump should read the Constitution sometime and learn what he can and cannot do. He is not our Dictator. He should stop acting like he his.

Truth be told a ban will not keep real terrorists out of the country. They will find a way to come here. Terrorists are not concerned about any law.

Personally the little Christian boy next door, who's Mom owns a gun and shuffles him off to church every Sunday worries me more. Then one day he rebels, takes her gun and kills a bunch of first graders. </TEXT>
