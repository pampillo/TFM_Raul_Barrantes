<TEXT>  Shit, if someone handed me $2 million, I'd use it to future-proof my life. Universal basic income, for me only.

Yeah me too. I'm financially savvy enough to know that it's not enough to just spend and spend, but it would provide me with a comfortable life. It's approximately 1.55m, I'd spend around 300k - 500k on a nice house in the countryside, maybe 30k on the car I've dreamed of for a while. Then invest the rest of it. I currently spend less than 12k a year, so even a 1% return would cover my living expenses for life. So I would quit my job and do things I actually enjoy doing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> CO2 would do it too, as would any pure gas other than oxygen. Gaseous exchange in the lungs works by diffusion, diffusion works by concentration gradients. So the higher the difference in concentration, the higher the rate of diffusion. So if you inhale gas with 0% oxygen, then it will actually cause oxygen to diffuse out of your blood in to the gas in your lungs very quickly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Took me a while to work out how to work out the probability of this, but here goes.

There are 4! ways of arranging answers in each question.  
There are 4!^20 ways of arranging 4 answers in each of 20 questions.  
There are 20! ways of arranging 20 questions in each topic.  
There are 20!^5 ways of arranging 20 questions in each of 5 topics.  
There is 1 way of arranging the topics in the exam.  
There are 4!^20 x 20!^5 x 1 ways of arranging 4 answers in 20 questions in 5 topics.  

4!^20 x 20!^5 x 1 = **3.42*10^119 different possible exam permutations. This is more than the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe.** I wouldn't bother asking about changing the order of the topics.

<TEXT> Total cunt. She used torrents and I asked her to limit seeding to off-peak times, so we didn't get our connection throttled (read: major lag on any online games). She agreed to that and I helped change the settings so that her torrent client wouldn't seed on weekday evenings. I didn't realise that peak times included weekend daytimes as well, so I asked her again to change the settings and she blew up on me. Something about trying to control her. I just explained that seeding can be done at any time, and doing it outside hours which will affect me (e.g. weekdays and nights) would be the decent thing to do. She refused, so I blocked her MAC address on the router (the internet was in my name). She went and unplugged the router, so I called her a bitch and ended up moving out shortly after.

<TEXT> Although you are technically correct, I think there is some confusion. Although the average life expectancy was much lower in the past, it doesn't mean that few people lived past reproduction age. [The infant mortality was very high, so this massively skewed the average life expectancy data.](http://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/did-people-in-past-really-only-live-to-be-30.htm)  
For example, if you have 3 people, 2 of which die at age 1, and one who dies at 70, then their average life expectancy is 24.  
Average life expectancy doesn't always paint an accurate picture.In the past, if you survived the first few years of childhood, you stood a good chance of reaching a relatively old age. </TEXT>

Lots of people have the attitude that 'being British means we're better than everyone else' despite most people being mostly unremarkable.

<TEXT>  What is delusional is that the people voting remain are either students, metropolitan employees, already rich pop figures, or people with a vested interest in existing European/UK trade/grants.  

This isn't delusional thinking.  

 Because we don't have anything more to lose.  

I'm not doing great, so I'll drag the country down with me. Great attitude.  

 It's a clusterfuck, and the EU has not helped this case.  

Please elaborate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There have been an estimated [107 billion humans](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16870579) who have ever lived. The average person walks [110,000 miles in a http://snowbrains.com/brain-post-how-far-does-the-average-human-walk-in-a-lifetime/).  

107 billion x 110,000 = 11,770 trillion miles  

Since 1970 the total number of miles travelled by vehicles in the USA was approximately [106 trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M12MTVUSM227NFWA). The USA is approximately 5% of the world's population. Assuming the whole world travels the same number of miles by vehicle per person as Americans (this is a high estimate) then then the total miles travelled by land vehicles since 1970 is:  

106 trillion x 20 = 2,120 trillion miles by land vehicles, which doesn't come close to the distance travelled by humans.  

There is a lot of room for error in these figures, but it seems highly unlikely we have travelled more miles in land vehicles than on foot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone with chemical engineering education here. Yes, sarin does thermally decompose when exposed to relatively low temperatures [(source)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sarin#section=Stability). It does not mean that all of it will decompose immediately at elevated temperatures. Also, sarin is 5x denser than air, so any release would stay low to the ground. I'm not saying the Russians' story is true, but it is plausible.  

**Edit:** [This](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24142-how-the-us-may-try-to-destroy-syrias-chemical-weapons/) article from new scientist backs up my assertion. **'[The destruction of the chemical weapons] could not be comprehensive and explosions could release intact lethal gas with fatal results, even if done with sufficient heat.'** </TEXT>

r/place was this years April Fools' Day social experiment that Reddit launches yearly. To sum it up, it was basically a giant collaborative online drawing that everyone could see in live action, where each user could place a single pixel anywhere and in any color on a digital "canvas", before being given a 5-10 minute cool down before they could place another one. The general idea was that everyone could work together to make artwork (or just vandalize the place). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you. I think that comparing this way of thinking to Hitler is a poor argument. This is completely different. A baby which has just been born has no self-awareness and will not even know that it is going to be killed. As long as it is done humanely then I think it is often for the greater good. A severely disabled child is a drain on society and the family it is born in to. I also find it morally reprehensible to sentence some children to a lifetime of suffering (those born with [epidermolysis bullosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermolysis_bullosa), for example). We put injured animals out of their suffering, but we won't do it to our own. </TEXT>

If a vote is held to decide what will be had for meals, then sweets and chocolate would win every time. This is because the children lack the knowledge about how their decision will affect them in the long-term. Good parents would listen to their requests for these bad foods, but ultimately prevent them from damaging themselves. </TEXT>

I have come to the same conclusion. When they realise that immigration will hardly change, they pretend that they voted for something else, such as 'taking back control'. All they will accomplish is to hand power to the ruthless Conservatives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The minimum velocity to reach low earth orbit is 9.4 km/s or 9400 m/s. So your velocity upon release from the trebuchet should be at least this amount (in reality it would need to be greater because you will lose some velocity due to drag). Assuming the trebuchet would accelerate you to this velocity in 50 m (this is probably an over estimation) then the acceleration you would experience would be 9400^2 / (2 * 50) = 883600 m/s or 90,160 G which would tear you to pieces (assuming the trebuchet was made of materials which could withstand such forces). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I think Pythagoras should be taught the way that HE taught it: to inspire people. It's not really about triangles, it's about the meaning of life, and how to be happy.
 Pythagoras was the first and greatest of all philosophers. Thousands of years before theoretical physics was proven, Pythagoras worked out that everything is made of mathematics. And whereas amateurs like Plato has armchair ideas about fascist philosopher dictatorships, Pythagoras actually created his ideal society in the real world. based on fairness and respect.
 Pythagoras was first and foremost a utopian thinker. He loved math only because it frees the mind: suddenly the world really can make sense and it's beautiful. What a powerful concept! In a world of superstition and violence, Pythagoras brought enlightenment.
 The triangle thing is just a small illustration. For thousands of years people had been building houses, and that involves square things, and that means diagonals across them (for roofs and stuff). People would guess, and houses sometimes fell down. Not nice if its your house. But Pythagoras showed how to get perfect answers. No more houses that fall down! No more measuring! If you know one thing (e.g. the sides of your house) then you already know the diagonal without measuring it.
 The triangle principle, and others like it, describe the entire universe! By knowing a simple thing you can know far more. You can comprehend the entire universe, and have the power to build, to invent, to bend reality to your will! Pythagoras isn't about triangles, he's about life, the universe and everything!
 It makes me sad when Pythagoras is taught in math class: as if anybody cares about triangles. Nobody cares about triangles! We care about the future, about making sense of the world, about building stuff that actually works. The triangle theorem (which was probably not even invented by him) is just a symbol of a much bigger principle.

What a fantastic quotation!

<TEXT> You probably are intelligent enough, it might be a confidence problem. Learning maths is a little bit like constructing a building, you need solid foundations and you must build each floor in turn. If you don't have the basics down, the more advanced topics will be a mystery. For example to be able to use Pythagoras properly you need to understand algebra, arithmetic, exponents, roots. If you don't understand these, you will struggle with Pythagoras. If you do understand them, then it's only a small step up. </TEXT>

Sending out emails en masse requires little effort, but actually grooming someone to transfer money takes considerable effort.

<TEXT> Mayonnaise is an interesting fluid. It's what is known as a [Bingham plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_plastic), so it behaves as a solid under low stress, but behaves like a viscous fluid at high stress. ELI5: when increasing force is applied to it, it behaves as a solid until a certain point where it will start to flow. This means that the mayonnaise won't simply flow out of you, it will all have to be pushed hard.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is an interesting video demonstrating the behaviour of Bingham plastics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Q = M.C.T  
Q = heat transferred  
M = mass of water  
C = heat capacity of water  
T = change in temperature  
Q will be the same for hot and cold so we can equate them.  
Mc = mass of cold water  
Mh = mass of hot water  
Tc = temperature change of cold water  
Th = temperature change of hot water  
Mc x Tc = Mh x Th  
Mc/Mh = Th/Tc  
Mc/Mh = (100-43)/(43-9)  
Mc/Mh = **1.68 parts cold water to hot water**  
This basically means for every 100 ml of hot water you need to add 168 ml of cold water. But this assumes no heat losses. There will be some inevitable heat losses during pouring so I would use 160 ml of cold water for every 100 ml of hot water.

<TEXT> From [this](http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Water/temp.html) image it can be seen that the sea temperature varies, but the bulk of the water (below 500 m) is approximately 5 C. So the temperature will need to be raised to 15 C. Certain assumptions must be made.  
1) There is no evaporation.  
2) The average temperature of the sea is 5 C.  
3) There is no energy transfer out of the system.  
4) The system reaches thermal equilibrium (in reality the oceans are so large that there will always be pockets of warmer and colder fluid).  
The equation being used will be  
Q = m.c.T  
where  
Q = heat transferred  
m = mass  
c = heat capacity  
T = change in temperature  

The heat transferred will be the same for copper and water. So we can equate both sides.  
m(copper).c(copper).T(copper) = m(water).c(water).T(water)  
Rearranging to make m(copper) the subject.  
m(copper) = m(water).c(water).T(water)/(c(copper).T(copper))  
m(water) = 1.386x10^18 tonne  
c(water) = 4.184 J/(g.C)  
T(water) = (15-5)C = 10C
c(copper) = 0.385 J/(g.C)  
T(copper) = (50-15)C = 35C  
m(copper) = 1.386x10^18 x 4.184 x 10 / (0.385 x 35)  
m(copper) = 4.304x10^18 tonnes  

The density of copper is 8.96 tonnes per m^3 so the volume of copper is as follows.  
V(copper) =  4.304x10^18 / 8.96 = **4.803x10^17 m^3**  

**This is 35% of the volume of water in the oceans.**

EDIT: During my calculations I mixed up the delta t for copper and water and so my answer was slight wrong.

<TEXT> Being the pedant I am, I must point out that as the event has happened then the probability of it happening is 1.  

Pedantry aside, assuming childhood you picked a colour at random to colour in your car and it was one of these [basic colours](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/56vvdAmAogY/maxresdefault.jpg) then the chance of it being yellow is 1/11. The percentage of yellow cars in the USA (which is where I assume you're from) is [3%](http://www.cars.com/go/advice/Story.jsp?section=top subject=colors).  
1/11 x 0.03 = 0.00273 or **1 in 367** so your friend is an idiot. It is worth noting that this is just the chance of a random car you received being the same as a randomly coloured-in car. Specifying the time period between them and the other events would make it even more unlikely, and almost impossible to calculate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know. I forgot to mention that. It would also cause unconsciousness within a few breaths because the low partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs would produce a concentration gradient in favour of oxygen diffusion out of the blood. Another point worth mentioning is that the world's estimated helium reserves are estimated at only 4x10^10 m^3 so we would only be able to acquire just under half of what we need. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Using your for dimensions I got a very different answer.  
First calculate the volume of the dot modelling it as a cylinder.  
V =  x r^2 x h  
V = 3.14 x (5x10^-4 m)^2 x 10^-9 m  
V = 7.85x10^-16 m^3  
Next calculate the mass of the dot based on the density of graphite.  
M =  x V  
M = 2266 kg/m^3 x 7.85x10^-16 m^3  
M = 1.78x10^-12 kg  
Then calculate the number of moles by dividing by molecular weight and using conversion factors.   
kmols = M/Mr  
kmols = 1.78x10^-12 kg / 12 kg/kmol  
kmols = 1.48x10^-13 kmol  
mols = 1.48x10^-13 kmol x 1000 mol/kmol  
mols = 1.48x10^-10 mol  
Finally use Avagadro's number to calculate the number of atoms.  
No. atoms = mols x Av  
No. atoms = 1.48x10^-10 mol x 6.02x10^23 atoms/mol  
No. atoms = **89,300,000,000,000** </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the helium was contained by a weightless boundary which covered the bottom of the dome then it would actually be buoyant (assuming it doesn't structurally fail from the forces involved.  
Force(up) = Vo x (air) x g  
Force(up) = 9.802x10^10 m^3 x 1.29 kg/m^3 x 9.81 m/s^2  
Force(up) = 1.240x10^12 N  
Mass(dome) = 7.684x10^10 kg  
Mass(He) = Vi x (He)  
Mass(He) = 9.799x10^10 m^3 x 0.164 kg/m^3 = 1.607x10^10 kg
Mass(dome + He) = 7.684x10^10 kg + 1.607x10^10 kg = 9.291x10^10 kg  
Force(down) = Mass(dome + He) x g  
Force(down) = 9.291x10^10 x 9.81 m/s^2 = 9.115x10^11 N  
Force(net) = Force(up) - Force(down)  
Force(net) = 1.240x10^12 N - 9.115x10^11 N = 3.289x10^11 N  
Acceleration = Mass(dome+He)/Force(net)  
Acceleration = 9.291x10^10 kg / 3.289x10^11 N = **3.5 m/s^2 upward**  

So the dome would float upward until the air density reduces enough to prevent the buoyancy overcoming the weight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used reasonable assumptions. Yeah I considered the fact it may break under its own weight, but I'm unsure of the calculations for this. Compressive stress at the base is just total weight/area (I think). I calculated it to be 92 MPa. Some types have glass have compressive strengths around 500 MPa. The tensile strength would let it down while being moved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They definitely won't be the same temperature. If you add the colder water first then the temperature of the whole vessel is lower so it will lose heat at a slower rate according to Newton's law of cooling.

<TEXT> Natural light consists of all of the colours of the spectrum. The colour of an object is just the colours of light which are reflected by the object, the rest are absorbed. Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of light, so for and object which is black, the molecules it is made of will absorb almost all wavelengths of light, so very little is reflected back to your eyes. Anyway, the UV light in the sun can changes the structure of the molecules in cotton so that they absorb a different wavelength of light and so the colour of the cotton changes because it it now reflective different wavelengths of light. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly we need to calculate the  size of the dome. Springfield is based on the real town of Springfield, Oregon. The size of this town will be used to estimate the size of the dome. The area of Springfield, Oregon is [40.79 km^2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Oregon). Assuming the Simpson's Springfield is a circle of the same area then the radius of the circle can be calculated.  
r = sqrt(40.79/) = 3.603 km = 3603 m  

The thickness of the dome must also be estimated. [This](http://m.imgur.com/KXxpuOn) picture shows that the dome's thickness is approximately two times the diameter of Prof. Frink's head. The average circumference of an adult male's head is [56.9 cm](http://www.smf.org/docs/articles/pdf/chingtechbrief.pdf). Assuming Frink has a circular shaped head of average circumference then the diameter of his head can be calculated.  
56.9 cm /  = 18.1 cm   
This value is doubled to calculate the dome's thickness.  
18.1 cm x 2 = 36.2 cm = 0.362 m  

To calculate the dome's volume we calculate the volume of the outer layer of the dome and then take away the volume of the inner dome.  
Volume of outer dome (Vo)  
Vo = 2/3 x  x (3603 m + 0.362 m)^3 = 9.802x10^10 m^3  
Volume of inner dome (Vi)  
Vi = 2/3 x  x 3603 m^3 = 9.799x10^10 m^3  
Volume of glass in dome (Vg)  
Vg = Vo - Vi = 2.955x10^7 m^3  

The density of glass is [2.6 t/m^3](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/density-solids-d_1265.html). This can be used to calculate the mass of glass.  
2.955x10^7 m^3 x 2.6 t/m^3 = **76.8 million tonnes**  

The Bell-Boeing Osprey is a VTOL aircraft of similar appearance to the ones in the film. It has an external cargo carrying capacity of [6.8 tonnes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey).  
76.8x10^6 t / 6.8 t/aircraft = **11.3 million aircraft** so the answer is: **NO**  

**Edit: Thanks to /u/ElliotJW for pointing out that I used an incorrect Springfield and here is my reply to him.**

You're perfectly fine to question my sources, I welcome constructive criticism. After viewing my source again and looking at other sources it turns out that my source was a mis-interpretation of some of Matt Groening's comments and the real world location (if it exists) of Springfield remains ambiguous. Don't believe everything you read on the Internet, kids.  

**Edit 2: So many times on this sub I have seen incorrect calculations which are just blindly believed. A similar thing happens on social media and in the news/newspapers. People just believe what they read without questioning. Sometimes genuine mistakes are made and sometimes there is an agenda behind misleading information. Please, please, please keep a healthy skepticism and don't be afraid to question things which don't seem correct or which you're unsure about. I would rather be wrong and everybody knows, rather than wrong and everyone believes I'm right** </TEXT>

<TEXT> You figured right. It is much larger.  

0.02 g/cm^3 = 20 kg/m^3  
1 tonne = 1000 kg   

So divide the mass by the density  
1000 kg / 20 kg/m^3 = **50 m^3**  

This is the volume he should have calculated based on his density data.  

I found the density of feathers to be 0.0025 g/cm^3 or 2.5 kg/m^3 ([source](http://www.visionlearning.com/en/library/General-Science/3/Density/37)).

1000 kg / 2.5 kg/m^3 = 400 m^3

Based on this value the volume is **400 m^3 !** </TEXT>

<TEXT> The volume of Earth's water is 1.386x10^9 km^3.  
This is equal to 1.386x10^18 m^3.  
An Olympic pool is 50 m long, 25 m wide, and between 2 and 3 m deep. So the smallest possible pool is:  
50 m x 25 m x 2 m = 2,500 m^3  
The largest possible pool is:  
50 m x 25 m x 3 m = 3,750 m^3  
The distance to the moon is 384,400 km (3.844x10^8 m).  

**For the smallest possible pool**
Calculate the number of pools
1.386x10^18 m^3 / 2,500 m^3 = 5.544x10^14 pools  
Calculate the total distance covered by the pools
5.544x10^14 x 50 m = 2.772x10^16 m
Calculate the number of times to the moon
2.772x10^16 m / 3.844x10^8 m = 72,112,382
Calculate the number of times to the moon and back
72,112,382 / 2 = 36,056,191

**For the largest possible pool**
Calculate the number of pools
1.386x10^18 m^3 / 3,750 m^3 = 3.696x10^14 pools  
Calculate the total distance covered by the pools
3.696x10^14 x 50 m = 1.848x10^16 m
Calculate the number of times to the moon
1.848x10^16 m / 3.844x10^8 m = 48,074,922
Calculate the number of times to the moon and back
48,074,922 / 2 = 24,037,461  

So depending on the size of the pools they could **reach the moon and back between 24.04 million and 36.06 million times!**

<TEXT> An Olympic pool is 0.0000025 km^3.  

1 km^3 = 1,000,000,000 m^3  

To visualise it imagine a huge cube with sides length 1 km.  
This is 1 km x 1 km x 1 km = 1 km^3  
or  
1000 m x 1000 m x  1000 m = 1,000,000,000 m^3.

So if you multiply your final answer by 1 million you get the actual answer. </TEXT>
