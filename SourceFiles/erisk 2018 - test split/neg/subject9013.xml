Eifert is high risk, but high reward with his red zone targets. 

I'm leaning toward Kelce just for the guaranteed PPR points, but it'll probably backfire when Eifert scores two TDs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you ask someone to rank their five sense by importance, smell is probably near the bottom. Sure, it's great to avoid odors that are unpleasant, but this quote from the article shows how much smell can impact someone's life in unexpected ways:
I joke I cant smell my daughters diaper. But I cant smell my daughter. She was up at 4 oclock this morning. I was holding her, we were laying in bed. I know what my son smelt like as a little baby, as a young kid. Sometimes not so good, but he still had that great little kid smell to him. With her, Ive never experienced that. </TEXT>

This study is interesting because it first shows that smells are not always perceived as one whole object  they can be broken down into their pieces, he added. This is perhaps not a surprise  there are in fact coffee or wine specialists that can detect faint whiffs of particular elements within the complex mixture of flavors in each coffee or wine. But by doing these studies in mice, we can now get a better understanding of how the brain does this.

Were demonstrating that these birds are sentient creatures, she said. In terms of conservation, people love to conserve animals that share qualities with humans, so if we can show that these birds  which are an endangered species  are really as smart as a 5- or 6-year-old child, that can help with conservation efforts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome to the world of whiskey! I joined the craze with Old Fashioneds a while back (thanks Mad Men), then worked my way down to ryes, and now I mostly drink bourbon. I'd experiment and host a tasting night with friends. As for the burn, try diluting with water instead of ice. Once you work up to being more comfortable with the burn, just order your whiskey neat with a glass of ice on the side. That way, if it's too strong, you can decide how much you want to drop in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome to /r/Boston and Boston! I was a transplant from outside Philly about a decade ago. Some thoughts...

- Almost everyone living near the city uses the "T" (our subway). In other cities, people resist public transportation, but in Boston, it's the best way to get around. The T stops running just before 1am, so be prepared to take a cab if you're out late. Developers have build some great apps for the T, check them out here: http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/apps/Default.asp

- Good idea looking for a place outside the city. Some towns to consider are: Somerville, Medford, Brookline, Malden, ~~Jamaica Plain~~. In general, north and west of the city has more transportation options (driving up to Boston from south of the city is a nightmare). The closer you are to T stops, the more expensive the rent. So, if you have your own car, keep that in mind.

- Fun thing to do: Walk the freedom trail. It's a great way to see downtown, get familiar with local culture, and you can just walk it yourself and avoid crowds. Here's a map: http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/maps/pdfs/boston-nps-map.pdf

- If you enjoy good beer or bourbon (shout to /r/bourbon), Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville have so many great places. Go explore and avoid the chain restaurants.

Best of luck!

Edit: JP is a neighborhood of Boston. Maps and stuff. </TEXT>

McManus is writing his dissertation on how Ciceronian Latin rhetoric was the pedagogical lodestar of humanistic learning from the Middle Ages onward, how it was exported to the disparate cultures of the European colonies, and how it changed in those new contexts. His research in colonial-era archives throughout the world involves looking for anything written in Latin, basically, he said.

If a submitter did become an issue, I'd work with the other mods to find the best way to reach out through PM, explain the goals of the community, and hope for a resolution that benefits both sides.

<TEXT> Hi [/r/highereducation](http://www.reddit.com/r/highereducation/) friends,

Hope you consider me as a Mod. A little about my background...

I'm currently a digital content strategist for a university in the Boston area. I've been a higher education professional for over 6 years, working in Admissions, Enrollment, and Web/Digital Strategy. I've created some sites for the highered community as well, including [FollowEDU.com](http://followedu.com/) (a Twitter directory for Higher Education) and [EDUtweetups](http://www.insidehighered.com/calendar/twitter) (a calendar of Higher Ed hashtags, conferences, and chats - acquired by InsideHigherEd.com in 2011). I share #highered articles/news/content on Twitter at [@subject9013](http://www.twitter.com/subject9013).

I've been an active redditor for over 2 years, participating in subreddits like /r/science, /r/technology, /r/listentothis (I'm a drummer), and most recently /r/bourbon.

I've been doing front-end web design for several years, so I'd be completely comfortable doing a CSS overhaul for /r/highereducation. I love when Mods customize the look and feel ([/r/thewalkingdead](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/), etc.).

To the current Mods - congrats on the continued growth and engagement here! Thanks for opening up a thread for us to volunteer, and once again, I'd love to join the team.

<TEXT> I hosted a bourbon tasting party with my wife (our first) in September. Just a few tips:

* Bought some [whiskey glasses](http://www.amazon.com/Stolzle-Glencairn-Whiskey-Glass-Boxed/dp/B003TMCNI8/) before the tasting event - they were totally worth it.

* For snacks, we had an assortment of cheeses, grapes, pretzels, nuts, and dark chocolate

* Also made some [gougres](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja ved=0CEAQFjAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.davidlebovitz.com%2F2009%2F01%2Fgougeres-french-cheese-puffs%2F ei=cZihUJiAEqrC0AGHg4GIBg usg=AFQjCNF1nWLSaN4FX_RIhsFp1OQxi99xaA sig2=q5FGTDfUTwb77lfUWhWOzQ) (French cheese puffs) - they were delicious and helped fill up guests between tastings

* Read a quick description of each bourbon before each tasting. I thought it would be cheesy, but the guests really enjoyed it.

* We tasted 6 bourbons over the course of about 2.5 hours. No one was liquored up. Bottles of water at the table helped.

* Print sheets (or send a follow-up email) to the group with the names/years of each bourbon. 

Enjoy your tasting night - hope it goes well! </TEXT>

As the planet shifts on its axis, stress on the tectonic plates that make up Earths crust increases, Mitrovica explained.

<TEXT> I'd suggest a cichlid tank. It's freshwater so it'll be cheaper than saltwater. Dedicate your time into getting the right setup (substrate, rocks / providing territories for your fish, # of fish to buy, etc). Stick to one lake if you buy African cichlids (Malawi, Tanganyika) or get 2-3 American cichlids. Go with fishless cycling if you can, or get some giant danios as dither fish and to aid in cycling.  </TEXT>
