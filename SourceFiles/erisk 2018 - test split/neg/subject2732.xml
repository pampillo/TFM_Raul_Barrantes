<TITLE> Claustrophobic, Dark and Haunting Instrumentals: Similarity Between Exulcerare [Miserere Luminis] And Onyx [Alcest] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 08:38:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Both these instrumental tracks create a menacing atmosphere that conveys melancholy. And it looks like Alcest's track which came later shows high similarity to Miserere Luminis' one (Neige said the song was a studio accident where they distorted the first riff of their song "Je Suis D'ailleurs"). Thoughts?

The whole cast is talented as hell. Love their voices. Josie's hair looks awesome in this.
Wouldn't it be awkward for Archie and Valerie to sing together after their breakup, haha. Hope they continue to be friends in the future tho. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I think it might be part of the OST composed for that episode. Because there are only [4 songs](https://www.tunefind.com/show/riverdale/season-1/47100) by featured artists listed under episode 12, and those does not include that scene. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Archie. It's sad to see the hate he's been getting over his confused love life. Every Riverdale video on YouTube has lots of people commenting about how he's a fuckboy and is the worst character in the show. I think his character in the show is a great portrayal of the comic book character.
Loved how he was there for Jughead and Veronica in their times of need. Also hope that we'll get more Archie and Betty moments in the future. They kind of dried out after ArchieRonnie and Bughead happened. :( 
Looking forward to more character development for Archie in the future seasons. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think so too. Someone earlier pointed out that one of Lee Toland Krieger's Instagram posts gave it away. The post said that KJ and Mads are the ones who got the worst of shooting on a frozen lake.

Hoping against hope that Archie's valiant attempt to save Cheryl does not go in vain. We need Cheryl to last for the future seasons. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jaime had some good lines in ASOS:
"The world was simpler in those days, Jaime thought, and men as well as swords were made of finer steel. Or was it only that he had been fifteen? They were all in their graves now, the Sword of the Morning and the Smiling Knight, the White Bull and Prince Lewyn, Ser Oswell Whent with his black humor, earnest Jon Darry, Simon Toyne and his Kingswood Brotherhood, bluff old Sumner Crakehall. And me, that boy I was  when did he die, I wonder? When I donned the white cloak? When I opened Aeryss throat? That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had become the Smiling Knight instead."

<TEXT> My favorite book out of the five currently released is ADWD. I agree that some parts were boring. But it contained some interesting stuff (Bran's POV chapters were my favorite parts of the book) AFFC was somewhat dragged out and uninteresting because we only got to see POVs of a limited number of characters. But Martin gave a lot of in detailed insight into the minds of some characters( Jaime and Cersei) I thought that was very well done.
But I'm hyped for TWOW and ADOS nevertheless. I'm sure they'll be interesting due to the fact that we'll get to finally see how the story plays out in Essos with Dany and Euron and then ultimately in Westeros with Ice and Fire. </TEXT>
