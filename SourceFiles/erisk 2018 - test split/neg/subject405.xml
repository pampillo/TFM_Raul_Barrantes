<TEXT>  You do not have to believe in god or in divine providence to be stoic.

That's certainly right and I completely agree to that.

However, if one wants to be a Stoic, things are far more complicated (see, for example, /u/cleomedes' [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/6aa0ho/can_i_actually_be_a_stoic_if_i_do_not_believe_in/dhd0xlj/)), because the ancient Stoics saw their philosophy as a unity and based their ethics also on physics and we are discussing things which are not unimportant, according to the Stoic texts we have. For example, the Stoic acceptance of wherever fate leads to would be more or less nonsensical without accepting these things. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What can a non-theist replace "god(s)" with to still get the benefits of his message?

The Stoics (and the Epicureans) were the materialists of their time and therefore one really should not mistaken the Stoic god with the Christian one. The Stoic god is very similar to Spinoza's god: the Stoics were basically pantheists. According to Diogenes Laertius, *The substance of God is declared by Zeno to be the whole world and the heaven, as well as by Chrysippus in his first book Of the Gods, and by Posidonius in his first book with the same title.* The Stoics also identified god with the inherent rationality of the cosmos, which they called *logos*. You may also read the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_do_stoics_believe_in_god.2C_or_gods.3F).

*Living according to nature* may be the shortest summary of Stoicism. However, the word 'nature' has to be explained to understand what that means. Others have summarized that far better than I am able to do, you may read again the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_what_does_it_mean_to_live_in_accordance_with_nature.3F) or Gregory B.

**Bullying and Being Bullied in Childhood Are Associated With Different Psychosocial Risk Factors for Poor Physical Health in Men**

Karen A. Matthews, J. Richard Jennings, Laisze Lee, Dustin A. Pardini

*Psychological Science*

First published date: April-28-2017

[10.1177/0956797617697700](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797617697700)

 **Abstract**

 Bullying and being bullied in childhood are both linked with later adjustment problems. The impact of childhood bullying on risk for poor physical health in adulthood is understudied. Black and White men (*n* = 305; mean age = 32.3 years) enrolled in the Pittsburgh Youth Study since the first grade underwent a comprehensive assessment of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological risk factors for poor health. Indices of bullying and being bullied were created by averaging annual ratings collected from participants and their caregivers when the participants were 10 to 12 years old. Results showed that being a bully in childhood was associated with greater stress and aggression and poorer health behaviors in adulthood, whereas being a victim of bullies in childhood was associated with lower socioeconomic resources, less optimism, and greater unfair treatment in adulthood. Unexpectedly, neither bullying nor being bullied in childhood was related to inflammation or metabolic syndrome. Bullying and being bullied in childhood were associated with distinct domains of psychosocial risk in adulthood that may later lead to poor physical health. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am no hedonist and think that hedonism is wrong because I don't regard pleasure as the highest good, not because shame follows pleasure (which is not necessarily true in a more general sense). But that was not my point.

I think that *hedonism without virtue* is wrong even *to the standards of hedonism*. Epicureanism, for example, is right in that it says that virtue is necessary for a happy life. If you act viciously or shamefully in pursuit of pleasure, this won't contribute to a happy life (because you will feel the shame and guilt or because you cannot be sure of not being caught).  </TEXT>

I am not so sure that a formal and complicated debate would work anyway. There are not a lot of participants to be expected (/u/B260 doesn't even want to be in the pyramid themselves) and it is doubtful that the few participants' breath is long enough. And who should decide at the end whose arguments are better (that is: who wins the debate)? Who would organize such a complicated debate? </TEXT>

I am not against these debates (I even participated in one some weeks ago in this great subreddit and enjoyed it), I just want to say what may happen to be prepared. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's certainly situational like everything else. I think that mutual openness and respect is best for both parties. Being able to talk openly about one's religion within a family certainly is very desirable in that regard. I don't think that one's religion is comparable to one's movie preferences, religion goes much deeper and has major consequences on daily life.

If coming out is no option, for example, because one is an adolescent depending on particularly difficult parents in religious regards, one may eventually be forced to lie and simulate for quite a long time. Some parents inflict a lot of stress and suffering on their children up to withdrawal of their parental responsibilities in such cases. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  SVF I, 214

For those who want to know what /u/Chrysippean is writing about:

SVF I, 214 is a passage from *M. Tullius Cicero, For Lucius Murena*:

 [61] And since we are not to address this speech either to an ignorant multitude, or to any assembly of rustics, I will speak a little boldly about the pursuits of educated men, which are both well known and agreeable to you, O judges, and to me. Learn then, O judges, that all these good qualities, divine and splendid as they are, which we behold in Marcus Cato, are his own peculiar attributes. The qualities which we sometimes wish for in him, are not all those which are implanted in a man by nature, but some of them are such as are derived from education. For there was once a man of the greatest genius, whose name was Zeno, the imitators of whose example are called Stoics. His opinions and precepts are of this sort: that a wise man is never influenced by interest; never pardons any man's fault; that no one is merciful except a fool and a trifler; that it is not the part of a man to be moved or pacified by entreaties; that wise men, let them be ever so deformed, are the only beautiful men; if they be ever such beggars, they are the only rich men; if they be in slavery, they are kings. And as for all of us who are not wise men, they call away slaves, exiles, enemies, lunatics. They say that all offenses are equal; that every sin is an unpardonable crime; and that he does not commit a less crime who kills a cock if there was no need to do so, than the man who strangles his father. They say that a wise man never feels uncertain on any point never repents of anything, is never deceived in anything, and never alters his opinion.

    Wherever your decrees have fixed my station."
    Cleanthes

    "I follow cheerfully; and, did I not,
    Wicked and wretched, I must follow still
    Whoever yields properly to Fate, is deemed
    Wise among men, and knows the laws of heaven."

<TEXT> You are not the only one. The Stoics saw Stoicism as a unity and it's wise to keep that in mind. All parts fit together and need each other, even though some parts may be more important than others. One may choose whatever one likes from a buffet, but not from a philosophy.

That being said, there is a history of philosophy and science of about 2000 years between the ancient Stoics and us. So some changes here and there may be necessary indeed, but that has to be done in a reasonable way. If Chrysippus lived today, he certainly would not write exactly the same word for word either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All things are interdependent, absolutely nothing exists alone for itself. Compare different human beings with parts of the same body. One cannot awaken without compassion.

 From my current understanding it is not a necessity and someone who is a psychopath for example could just as well become awakened, as long as he realizes his flow of karma and puts an end to rebirth.

The path to the end of suffering does not consist of realizing the flow of karma alone. The path to the liberation from samsara is the [Noble Eightfold Path](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html). The path includes eliminating ignorance, craving and the like and cultivating a certain practice and state of mind which, of course, includes compassion (*karuna*) being a basic part of *right intentions*. </TEXT>

Simply sitting down and writing a literary masterpiece out of nothing is not the normal case.

So you may just follow the usual route and choose a day job wisely, such that you can follow your passion. And write whenever you can.

<TEXT>  By the way, there was a disciple of Zeno of Citium (the founder of Stoicism), called Dionysus of Heraclea also called Dionysus the Renegade, that had a terrible illness in the eyes. He was not sure that the pain was indifferent and after years of Stoicism learning he determined to leave Stoicism and converted to Epicureanism.

Thanks for the opportunity for me to learn something new! However, [according to Diogenes Lartius](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_VII#Dionysius) he did not convert to the Epicureans:

 When he fell away from Zeno, he went over to the Cyrenaics, and used to frequent houses of ill fame and indulge in all other excesses without disguise. After living till he was nearly eighty years of age, he committed suicide by starving himself.

Although both schools are regarded as hedonists, the Cyrenaics were quite different to the Epicureans in that they did not define pleasure as the absence of pain and distress as the Epicureans did, but as something reaching beyond that. They valued all pleasures as good, but classified bodily pleasures as somehow superior, while it's tranquility the Epicureans were after. Epicureans typically live modestly and limit their desires, which is not exactly what Cyrenaics are famous for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generalization like yours are most often wrong. Different people are different and behave differently and deal with strong pain differently. What you are writing is not true for everyone on the planet.

It is also an invalid generalization to say, that not liking pain is the whole reason for people to kill themselves, just because some commit suicide because of that. But people simply do not kill themselves only because of that. For example, some are sacrificing themselves to save the lives of their offsprings, family members, friends or even strangers. And there are a lot of more reasons as well.

<TEXT>  your assertion that modern interpretations of a philosophy are "distortions" or not evolvements.

That's not what I wrote - or at least not what I meant. These particular distortions are not evolvements, they are not even interpretations. Some of these distortions are even defamations of opponents.

That does not mean that valid modern interpretations cannot exist (I even think it would be stupid to say so). However, at a given point an evolvement becomes something new, but that does not concern these particular distortions either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Philosophy evolves and should evolve indeed. However, in this case it's not about official vs. evolvements, because these distortions simply are not evolvements of the original philosophies. They are not even similar to each other. Epicureans are neither uncontrolled hedonists nor gluttons and Stoics are neither statues nor wannabe entrepreneurs doing videos for other wannabe entrepreneurs.

Moreover, the ancient philosophies cannot change anymore, because they ceased to exist long ago. They are part of history now. We can (and should) study them thoroughly and our knowledge certainly will improve by doing that, but the objects of our study just stay what they were. There is also so much lost, such that we cannot even be sure about what they really taught in detail.

When we study them today we are doing best to learn most precisely what they were alike within their context. Then we may apply that knowledge to our own time, but it's highly questionable to call the result the same as the ancient philosophies, since human knowledge has changed so much. Epicurean and Stoic ethics were based on certain understandings of physics. Both Epicurean and Stoic physics are necessarily completely different to modern science, which has consequences on ethics, too.

There is an additional problem which is easy to forget: philosophies and religions consist of more than a literary tradition, which is the only thing we have from Epicureanism and Stoicism. There is also the cultural tradition, which we have lost completely. These can be quite different to each other. Reading Joseph Ratzinger's "Introduction to Christianity", for example, does not give one much clue of what children are taught in Catholic religion classes or what popular devotion is alike. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regarding the ancient philosophy called Stoicism, I disagree. However, quite a lot of people say *Stoicism*, but actually mean the small lettered *stoicism*. If you are refering to *stoicism*, I agree.

I think, we all should be aware of the fact that Epicureanism is misunderstood by a lot of people and that the same is true for Stoicism. Both ancient philosophies have virtually nothing to do with their distortions. Either ancient philosophy is a lot more nuanced than the distortion of the other philosophy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks a lot for engaging with me, too, I enjoy our conversation a lot.

I am interested in both philosophies and I agree that these different philosophies can complement each other to some degree what practical living is concerned. I am not as much convinced that this is true in a more general sense. Providence, for example, was an essential part of Stoicism and providence certainly is not anything Epicureans can agree to. The Stoics divided philosophy in ethics, logic and physics, but saw their philosophy as a unity nevertheless. Not everything of Stoic ethics makes sense without assuming providence, for example.

Providence is something I am not sure I can agree to. But then, I think it is better to [keep one's identity small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) anyway. I have been studying Stoicism quite a bit for a while now and have benefitting from it a lot, but I may have gone to far by stating that I have found my way to Stoicism or that I switched to Stoicism in one of my previous comments in the sense I'd call myself a Stoic now. It's more correct to say that I am an eclectic^* who is most attracted to Stoicism, Epicureanism and (much more loosely) to Buddhist philosophy.

Hellenism may be similar to our time in that there was quite a bit of uncertainty people felt. Both Stoicism and Epicureanism grew on that ground. Pulling oneself back from society to live a solitary life together with good friends certainly helps dealing with uncertain times. Stoicism offers a more active way within society. The teachings of Epicureanism and Stoicism are quite different and they saw themselves as opponent schools with good reasons. But both were what we call a philosophy of life today.

^* Eclecticism is not about believing whatever one likes, but about doing one's best to believe what is true using one's own best judgement. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The Enchiridion, for example, was required reading in schools somewhere (can't remember where).

It was even christianized by rewriting some parts concerning sexuality, exchanging 'Socrates' with 'St. Paul' and the like.

 Even after the end of the philosophical schools, a lot of people undertook the project of integrating Stoicism with their Christian belief.

You may be refering to the so-called Neo-Stoicism which some great people like Lipsius are known for. At the end they failed. Stoicism is by far not as compatible with Christianity as it may seem at first glance.

And it's really a pity that there are not more original sources of Epicureanism left. This is also true for the early and middle Stoa, but at least there are a lot of texts of the late Stoa. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But pleasure is not the highest good in Epicureanism.

Epicurus used two words: *hedone* and *ataraxia*. That is, there are passages where he used *hedone* and others where he used *ataraxia*. The word *hedone* is usually translated as *pleasure*.

However, I agree that *Hedonism* as it is commonly understood today is quite misleading. If we use words like *pleasure* while discussing Epicureanism, we may keep in mind that we are using technical terms whose meanings are much more nuanced than (and often quite different to) those in ordinary language.

 Existing in a state free of pain is not the same thing as "pleasure being the highest good".

I fully agree with you, because I am no Epicurean, but unfortunately that's what Epicurus wrote. He even wrote that freedom of pain is the highest pleasure. One may vary the quality of pleasure, but freedom of pain is the limit and pleasure doesn't get higher than that.

The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy offers a good [article about Epicurus](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/) and there we read:

 Because of this, Epicurus denies that there is any intermediate state between pleasure and pain. When one has unfulfilled desires, this is painful, and when one no longer has unfulfilled desires, this steady state is the most pleasurable of all, not merely some intermediate state between pleasure and pain. ([Source](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/#SH5b))

You may also have a look at the original sources like Principal Doctrines No. III, for example.

 I don't need the extremism of [Apatheia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheia), which Stoics seem to strive for.

Although I don't consider Wikipedia a good source for anything, even this article gets it right enough to wonder why you call *apatheia* an extremism. Its meaning is very different to the meaning of the English word *apathy*. You may also read the article ["Apatheia vs Ataraxia: whats the difference?"](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/apatheia-vs-ataraxia-whats-the-difference/) by Massimo Pigliucci, a well respected philosopher.

  I'm fine with some healthy equanimity, mindfulness, and moderation. Works for me. :)

Now I am wondering even more, because *equanimity* is the best translation of *apatheia*, according to the article you linked. Equanimity (*apatheia*), mindfulness (*prosoche*) and moderation are fully compatible with Stoicism and even belong to the core concepts. Works for me, too. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both philosophies have much in common, but they differ a lot, too. One has to look at what characterizes a philosophy in comparison to others and then they differ a lot. For example, virtue being the highest good and pleasure being the highest good is a huge difference, no matter how similar they are in other regards. I have always been an eclectic to some degree and still value Epicureanism highly, but I don't agree to some basics anymore and it's not a matter of taste as far I am concerned.

I like your approach about extroverts and introverts. If that's true, I am an exception, since I am an introvert and have been one my whole life. Stoic principles have helped me a lot until now and I have begun applying them when I still was an Epicurean. That's no surprise, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for example, is based on Stoicism as its founder states and belongs to the most effective therapies regarding anxiety, depression and the like.

<TEXT> We certainly don't know for sure indeed, but I am going to take that with much more grain of salt hereafter.

At first sight their birth and death dates are not really suspicious:

[Antisthenes (c. 446366 B.C.E.)](http://www.iep.utm.edu/antisthe/)

[Diogenes of Sinope (c. 404323 B.C.E.)](http://www.iep.utm.edu/diogsino/)

However, the article about Diogenes is interesting and supports your version:

 Diogenes Laertius reports that Diogenes of Sinope fell in with Antisthenes who, though not in the habit of taking students, was worn out by Diogenes persistence (*Lives of Eminent Philosophers*, Book 6, Chapter 22). Although this account has been met with suspicion, especially given the likely dates of Diogenes arrival in Athens and Antisthenes death, it supports the perception that the foundation of Diogenes philosophical practice rests with Antisthenes.

So thanks for your answer, this was interesting to learn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A Stoic (with capitalized 'S') acts as a rational and social animal in a socially responsible manner to the benefit of society, or at least aims to act that way. That is, a Stoic is not (or at least should not be) egoistical. *What is good for the hive, is also good for the bee* (loosely based on Marcus Aurelius).

However, this may not be true for a stoic (lower case), which Stoicism is being confused with quite often and maybe also not typical for at least some blogs and videos of certain wannabe entrepreneurs for other wannabe entrepreneurs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seneca cites some verses being attributed to Cleanthes in his [107^th letter to Lucilius](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_107):

    Lead me, O Master of the lofty heavens,
    My Father, whithersoever thou shalt wish.
    I shall not falter, but obey with speed.
    And though I would not, I shall go, and suffer,
    In sin and sorrow what I might have done
    In noble virtue. Aye, the willing soul
    Fate leads, but the unwilling drags along.

One also reads *"Fate leads the willing and drags along the reluctant."* being attributed to Seneca quite often, which appears to be a very free version of the quote from the 107^th letter to Lucilius. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the term *stoic* has not so much to do with *Stoicism* as people not knowing a lot about Stoicism may realize. Stoicism being understood as the ancient philosophy Stoicism is very diametrical to modern pop culture. I think, virtue being the only good, vice the only bad and everything else being indifferents, forming a completely different category than good and bad, differs from pop culture as much as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cannot offer a comprehensive explanation, but as someone who has been interested in Epicureism (and still is), but basically found his way to Stoicism I may not ignore your question.

It was not obvious for me that I may eventually switch to Stoicism some years ago. Today I am sorry that I have found to Stoicism so late. I still value Epicureanism very highly and won't stop reading papers on it, although I disagree with it in very important questions.

I don't agree, for example, that pleasure is the highest good and virtue is just a means to increase pleasure. I think that virtue is the only good. It is necessary and sufficient for *eudaimonia*. I prefer pleasure to distress, of course, but at the end pleasure is an indifferent. The more I learn about Stoicism and the more consequently I follow it, the more freedom from externals I gain. I feel much more content than before. Stoicism works.

What is virtue? After so many years of Christianity being dominant we necessarily understand virtue differently to the ancient Greek. The Greek word is *arete* and means *excellence*. That means, as far as human beings are concerned, I am basically talking about *excellence of character*.

This leads to the question what Stoicism is about. [A while ago I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/5jxl1v/how_would_you_describe_stoicism_to_someone_new_to/dbjstxx/):

 As a Stoic your goal is excellence of character, living up to your full potential as rational and social animal. Be a good person and make your decisions based on wisdom, justice, courage and moderation as a socially responsible member of society. This is basically what we Stoics mean by being virtuous.

 Don't fight your emotions, but don't let them corrupt your judgement either. Let your decisions and judgements be consistent with your goal, virtue is the only good after all.

 Accept whatever happens to you, unless it is your character flaw. Being a good person is what counts. Although prosperity is preferred to hardships, both are opportunities for personal heroism, albeit no one may know it.

In my opinion, it is not self-evident that the cosmos can be explained rationally and that working mathematical models of the cosmos can be developed. It's like there is an inherent rationality of the cosmos, which is something the ancients called *logos*. That's a reason for why I accept reason as the main characteristic of human beings, which gets one on the eudaimonic track.

I agree to the Stoic teachings on the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. And that all human beings are of equal value and meant to be born free. Cosmopolitanism, which was an important part of Stoicism from the beginning, is based on that ideas, too. The influence Stoicism has been having in regards to that cannot be underestimated. It is really fascinating who in the history of philosophy, literature and culture has been lead by their study of Stoicism. Petrarca, Lipsius, Grotius, Montaigne, Spinoza, Kant, Goethe, the authors of the first declaration of human rights in the age of enlightenment - just to name a few.

Since you mention self-help books and blogs, many of them are more about stoicism than about the ancient philosophy Stoicism, although they are refering to some ancient Stoics. I am not interested in those blogs and videos of wannabe entrepreneurs for wannabe entrepreneurs. Moreover, I doubt that just taking some Stoic principles is sufficient to call oneself a Stoic. The ancient Stoics saw Stoicism as a unity and as such it is to be understood, as far as I am concerned.

There are more reasons than that, I am talking just about myself here, but it may be sufficient to give you some idea.

<TEXT> I agree. The Stoics divided Stoicism into physics, logic and ethics, but certainly saw their philosophy as a unity and I think that Stoic ethics does not make much sense otherwise.

* Why accept reason as the main characteristic of human beings, which gets us on the eudaimonic track, if the  universe isn't organized according to rational principles?

* How can one reject providence and willingly and joyfully accept fate and wherever it leads to?

* The fundamental interconnectedness of all things has important consequences on Stoic ethics. Marcus Aurelius, for example, writes a lot about that in his *Meditations* and concluded what to do from that. Cosmopolitanism, which was an important part of Stoicism from the beginning, is based on that, too.

I think, by ignoring physics and logic, one basically looses the justification of ethics and the ability to know right and wrong. Picking and choosing from Stoic ethics may eventually be helpful indeed, but it certainly can cause serious problems, too, because Stoic ethics can be misunderstood so easily then. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is true in the sense that Stoic philosophy is very much about not compromising one's character which may eventually include accepting physical harm in situations which confront one with the choice of either be harmed physically or compromise one's character. That might be interpreted as self destructive from a non-Stoic point of view. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Epictetus is outstanding and quite humorous in his discourses. Chrysippus liked to laugh and make jokes and even died laughing at one of his own jokes, which in a way is outstanding, too.

I think, studying Epictetus in how he uses humor in his lectures may be interesting and maybe enough for a paper. If it's enough for a whole thesis is another question indeed. </TEXT>

It's more about the really bad situation which either forces people to look for extreme solutions in order to do completely normal things like studying at university or prevents them doing these things completely.

There is no reason why housing costs, for example, need to be that high, such that mostly rich people can afford studying at university. Hannah's admirable solution to the problem should not lead to the impression that there is no problem at all and the recognition that a problem exists should not make Hannah's solution less admirable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assuming that your intention is sincere, the answer to your question can be found in the major misrepresentation of Epicureanism by its enemies who try to make Epicureanism look like basically uncontrolled hedonism.

However, given the common understanding of hedonism, Epicureism is quite far away from it. In Epicureanism it's not about maximizing one's pleasures, but about happiness resulting from absence of physical pain and mental disturbance.

Eating good meals certainly is a good thing to do, but that's not what Epicureanism is about. </TEXT>

    [The Buddha admonished me:]
    Gutta, devote yourself to the goal
    for which you went forth,
    having discarded [hope]
    for a dear son of your own.
        Don't fall under the sway
        of the mind.

    Hoodwinked by mind,
    beings in love with Mara's realm,
        roam
    through the many-birth wandering-on,
         unknowing.

    Abandoning these lower fetters, nun 
        sensual desire, ill will,
        self-identity views,
        grasping at precepts   practices,
        and uncertainty as the fifth 
            you won't come
            to this again.

    Forsaking   passion, conceit,
        ignorance,   restlessness
        cutting through [all] the fetters 
        you will make an end
        of suffering   stress.

    Discarding birth   wandering-on,
    comprehending further becoming,
        free from hunger
    in the right-here- -now
    you will go about
        totally calmed. </TEXT>

Seneca is the least popular Stoic philosopher to some modern Stoics, but maybe the Roman Stoic with the biggest influence on later generations. Especially in the Renaissance, when Stoicism was studied by people like Francesco Petrarca, Hugo Grotius and Justus Lipsius to the point that it was intended to be revived in a Christianized version, it was Seneca who was studied thoroughly. </TEXT>

Removing oneself from society does not make sense. A Stoic socializes with women, drinks cocktails, enjoys nice meals and the like, but in a socially responsible manner. And a Stoic may not be as attached to these things as some other people.

Stoics are not expected to behave like statues. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is a moment when you need not to be stoic.

Stoicism certainly does not imply that one has to bear everything and always shut up. It is completely fine to make one's opinions abundantly clear, if necessary, it just has to be done virtuously. Giving assent to anger arising after an insult isn't very virtuous.

That being said, I am quite sure that my first reaction to an insult like that would be anger and similar in its wording, if put in words. However, I think, if I gave assent to that, my judgement would be misguided. Putting the same content in less aggressive words may certainly work much better, for them and for me. </TEXT>

Sure, it is a question, but a very helpful one.

Epictetus himself writes in chapter 52 of [The Enchiridion](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html):

    Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand:

    "Conduct me, Jove, and you, O Destiny,
    Wherever your decrees have fixed my station."
    Cleanthes

    "I follow cheerfully; and, did I not,
    Wicked and wretched, I must follow still
    Whoever yields properly to Fate, is deemed
    Wise among men, and knows the laws of heaven."
    Euripides, Frag. 965

    And this third:

Getting drunk, however, has high potential to affect virtue in a negative way, which makes it a problem indeed.

A lot of people underestimate the dangers of regular alcohol consumation, because drinking alcohol is a very accepted and often expected behavior in society. Loosing one's control is easy and the consequences can be disastrous. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  pleasure is a vice so it cannot be subordinated

Pleasure is an indifferent. According to [Donald Robertson's article](http://donaldrobertson.name/what-seneca-really-said-about-epicureanism/), the Stoics subordinated pleasure to reason. The Epicureans reversed that by making reason subordinate to pleasure.

 All equally indifferent, simple classification preferred and dispreferred.

Because of the classification it cannot be the case that everything is equally indifferent.

 Virtue can only be achieved through adversity.

Why?

 So anyone can tell me, if they found Any similarities between Epicureanism and Stoicism?

For example, both Epicureans and Stoics were materialists. </TEXT>

In this particular case the external is Trump, but he actually is just a placeholder here since the external could be anything else without invalidating the article. It also does not matter much if the judgement concerning Trump is justified or not. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is an interesting lecture on Epictetus, Boethius and Admiral James Stockdale by Professor Tamar Szab Gendler from Yale: [Flourishing and Detachment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EN8gs7D4tY)

 Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature ([PHIL 181](http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-181))

 Professor Gendler begins with a discussion of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, who argued that once we recognize that some things are up to us and other things are not up to us, we can see that happiness requires detaching ourselves from our desires and focusing instead on our attitudes and interpretations. Three pieces of advice from Epictetus about how to cultivate such detachment are provided, along with contemporary examples. A similar theme from Boethius is discussed, followed by a practical example of the benefits of detachment from Admiral James Stockdale's experiences as a prisoner of war.

<TEXT> In ancient times a philosopher was expected to live as a philosopher to be acknowledged as philosopher. Living philosophically is the hard part, theory is the easy part and makes practice easier. Epictetus taught theory as well, because it is necessary to know theory to live according to one's philosophy. I think it's no surprise that Marcus Aurelius contemplates over theory in his *Meditations* a lot.

There are many authors indeed, but no one is expected to read all of them. Reading is not futile though. It's better to concentrate on fewer, but good authors and to study them well than reading many authors only superficially. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are certainly right that there are features Leica M shares with other camera, but the rangefinder is its unique feature. This is not the same as the viewfinders of Fujifilm (which are certainly excellent viewfinders, but no rangefinders). Not everybody needs a rangefinder and it's certainly not the best option for all applications, but it is the best option for what Leica M is particularly good at.

And yes, Leica is expensive. But the lenses hold their value or get even more expensive, such that you may be able to sell them for more than you've paid for. This is certainly not always the case, but it happens. There is some luxury, too, like all those special editions, but apart from that you mostly get what you pay for. The manufactoring process is more expensive in Germany than in China and each lens is tested and much less lenses can be produced. Lenses of other brands of the same quality cost about the same (Zeiss Otus, for example), by the way.

More quality costs money and the price growth is not linear. The best Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Fuji... lenses are excellent tools, too, but further improvement can be very expensive. You need more expensive materials, improved precision, a better quality control and the like. The last 10% of quality may account for 90% of the price you have to pay.

Do you really need a Leica to take excellent photographs? Certainly not. But shooting with a Leica can be tremendously joyful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Both *Enchiridion* and *Meditations* are collections of brief advice.

Your answer is really good, I just want to add that it helped me to know that *Meditations* are Marcus Aurelius' private notebook and all its advices are directed to himself. It's the result of his personal spiritual practice as it is described by Epictetus, whose teachings had a huge impact on Marcus Aurelius.

When reading the *Enchiridion* it may also help to keep in mind that it was meant to have the basics at hand. Several tough passages which may be irritating to some at first are much easier to understand after reading Epictetus' discourses.

While starting with these two books is excellent advice, I'd like to add that it makes much sense to read a good introduction in addition to the sources. Our FAQ certainly is a very good starting point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this article is wrong from the beginning what Stoicism is concerned and that in a remarkable way. It starts with a straw man and it goes on like that. For example, the Stoic metapher about the dog following the cart which the dog is being tied to is actually being described the other way round in the article as it is originally intended according to Stoicism.

Although I have not read Ryan Holiday's article she is quoting, I assume she gets him wrong, too. But even if she understands him correctly, how can an opinion of a single person, any person, expressed in a short internet article refute a philosophy which was one of the major philosophies for about 500 years 2000 years ago? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that indecisiveness comes from worrying too much about what is outside our control. For example, other people's opinions, the outcomes of our actions and the like are outside our control. Within our control are our opinions, judgements and the like. This is what we should direct our attention to.

As rational and social animals we should try to be the best person we can be and act to our best knowledge as socially responsible humans without caring too much about what we cannot control anyway. Failure should not bother us much, unless it relates to weaknesses of our character.

It certainly takes time to internalize that, but at least I have become much more decisive because of insights like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stoicism is not about *"suffer and do not care about it"*, it's really all about virtue and justice is one of the main virtues. However, don't care only about justice towards yourself, since justice should be our concern in a much broader sense.

Try to be the best person you can be, do what you can do as good as possible and be indifferent about the outcome. Endurance can certainly be what is to be done in certain situations, but in general just enduring injustice is not the best thing one can do, since there are most often other (more virtuous) options which usually require courage, another of the main virtues. </TEXT>

I don't deny anybody to find their own way to happiness and I assume /u/bytor99 agrees to that as well, but since I am convinced that Stoicism is basically true, I consequently think that Stoicism must be universally true.

That being said, I really think that it is not possible to really know the truth. This may not be the traditional Stoic view, but I cannot ignore all good arguments of philosophers from other schools. We know only so little and are very prone to errors. We can only follow reason to where it leads us and this is certainly true for other people holding different views as well. Thus, it's not reasonable to expect other people to share our own views indeed. </TEXT>

Be a good person and make your decisions based on wisdom, justice, courage and moderation as a socially responsible member of society. This is basically what we Stoics mean by being virtuous.

Don't fight your emotions, but don't let them corrupt your judgement either. Let your decisions and judgements be consistent with your goal, virtue is the only good after all.

<TEXT> This is by far one of the worst articles about ethics I have ever seen. This article is so fundamentally flawed that it is hard to know where to begin with. Here is a [good article about ethics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/) and let's quote just the beginning:

 The field of ethics (or moral philosophy) involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. Philosophers today usually divide ethical theories into three general subject areas: metaethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics. Metaethics investigates where our ethical principles come from, and what they mean. Are they merely social inventions? Do they involve more than expressions of our individual emotions? Metaethical answers to these questions focus on the issues of universal truths, the will of God, the role of reason in ethical judgments, and the meaning of ethical terms themselves. Normative ethics takes on a more practical task, which is to arrive at moral standards that regulate right and wrong conduct. This may involve articulating the good habits that we should acquire, the duties that we should follow, or the consequences of our behavior on others. Finally, applied ethics involves examining specific controversial issues, such as abortion, infanticide, animal rights, environmental concerns, homosexuality, capital punishment, or nuclear war.

Most relevant for Stoicism is [virtue ethics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/virtue/) ([another article](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/)) which Stoic ethics is one of the best examples of. Virtue ethics, for example, is no set of rules at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mostly agree with you. I don't run into those folks too often, either. There is value in Stoic concepts outside of Stoicism, which is shown by the efficiency of CBT, for example. I don't see any reason for keeping back Stoic concepts from people just because they are not being applied within the original context.

That being said, I am opposed to calling the life hack "Stoicism" as if that were what the ancient philosophy called Stoicism was about. That's not honest, in my opinion. </TEXT>

On the other hand, there are other great Stoics, too, who belong to my favorites: Chrysippus, for example. I would love to read his works so much, but unfortunately they are lost. </TEXT>

[**M1 muscarinic allosteric modulators slow prion neurodegeneration and restore memory loss**](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/87526)

by Sophie J. Bradley, Julie-Myrtille Bourgognon, Helen E. Sanger, Nicholas Verity, Adrian J. Mogg, David J. White, Adrian J. Butcher, Julie A. Moreno, Colin Molloy, Timothy Macedo-Hatch, Jennifer M. Edwards, Jurgen Wess, Robert Pawlak, David J. Read, Patrick M. Sexton, Lisa M. Broad, Joern R. Steinert, Giovanna R. Mallucci, Arthur Christopoulos, Christian C. Felder, Andrew B. Tobin.

 **Abstract**

 The current frontline symptomatic treatment for Alzheimers disease (AD) is whole-body upregulation of cholinergic transmission via inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. This approach leads to profound dose-related adverse effects. An alternative strategy is to selectively target muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, particularly the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1 mAChR), which was previously shown to have procognitive activity. However, developing M1 mAChRselective orthosteric ligands has proven challenging. Here, we have shown that mouse prion disease shows many of the hallmarks of human AD, including progressive terminal neurodegeneration and memory deficits due to a disruption of hippocampal cholinergic innervation. The fact that we also show that muscarinic signaling is maintained in both AD and mouse prion disease points to the latter as an excellent model for testing the efficacy of muscarinic pharmacological entities. The memory deficits we observed in mouse prion disease were completely restored by treatment with benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) and benzoquinazoline-12 (BQZ-12), two highly selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of M1 mAChRs. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to BQCA markedly extended the lifespan of diseased mice. Thus, enhancing hippocampal muscarinic signaling using M1 mAChR PAMs restored memory loss and slowed the progression of mouse prion disease, indicating that this ligand type may have clinical benefit in diseases showing defective cholinergic transmission, such as AD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fullheartedly agree that Stoic principles can be very helpful even outside of Stoicism. However, if one wants to see how Christianity and Stoicism fit together, one should not concentrate on what can be applied within both Christianity and Stoicism, but at the core teachings which define Christianity and Stoicism. There were several highly gifted people who tried very hard to combine Christianity and Stoicism (Neostoicism)  and failed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I suppose the closest conception I hold true is that there is a natural ordering to the universe and everything in it. That is, there are iterative patterns and laws that bear the traces of design. Humankind is very much a part of the natural world and are equally subject to a certain natural ordering.

In other words, if I understand you correctly, you may agree to the view that there is some kind of rationality being inherent in nature (or cosmos, respectively) which humans share some part of? This may even come close to the Stoic *logos* to a certain degree, which the Stoics identified with god.

It may be discussed, however, if it is still correct to call that 'god'. The Stoics identified *logos* with god, but today we just cannot prevent people misunderstanding that with a theist god like the Christian god. Personally, I don't want to grant theists having a kind of monopoly on the word 'god'. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why not?

You may find part of the answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/5jbuey/any_good_buddhist_novels/dbfde7y/). Buddha and Siddharta share some similarities, but Siddharta rejected Buddha's teachings when he met Buddha. If you want to call a novel Buddhist because Buddha appears in it, then you may call it a Buddhist novel. However, I think that a book with a protagonist rejecting Buddha's teachings and finding a very different way to salvation can hardly be called Buddhist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not necessarily saying you are wrong, because there are some elements which made me initially suspicious, too. And, by the way, I am certainly not among those downvoting you. I know such claims by Christian apologists and I am highly annoyed about them (the claims and the apologists).

However, although I suspect some Christian influence (for example, because of the identification of the god mentioned in Stoic literature and the capitalized God and [his answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/5jd4ho/do_you_believe_in_god/dbf6ji4/) How does that fit in with your Stoicism? to someone who confesses being an atheist), the evidence that Marzilli is just a Christian who wants to confess here does not seem to be unambiguous enough to exclude other explanations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes indeed. Buddhism certainly inspired Hesse, but so did Hinduism, the Upanishads and the like. Buddha even plays a role in the book, but Siddharta does not agree with him and therefore does not follow him and finally finds his own way. People seem to misunderstand the kind of Buddhism's influence on the book quite often, but I think this misunderstang is not really based on the book. </TEXT>

 Unlike mainstream Cyrenaics, the Annicereans deny that friendship is chosen only because of its usefulness. Instead, the wise person cares for her friend and endures pains for him because of her goodwill and love. Nonetheless, the Annicereans maintain that your own pleasure is the telos and that a friends happiness isnt intrinsically choiceworthy. Their position appears internally inconsistent or to attribute doublethink to the wise person. But we can avoid these problems. We have good textual grounds to attribute to the Annicereans a doctrine of non-hedonic habits, which allows them to abandon psychological hedonism while still maintaining hedonism regarding well-being. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is correct that the launch dates are in reverse order. However, the numbering of the spacecrafts was not thought to be in the order of the launch dates. It's also interesting, that Voyager 2 was thought as a possible backup for Voyager 1 at a certain point.

 *Voyager 2* was launched on August 20, 1977, followed by *Voyager 1* on September 5, 1977. The decision to reverse the order of launch had to do with keeping open the possibility of carrying out the Grand Tour mission to Uranus, Neptune, and beyond. *Voyager 2*, if boosted by the maximum performance from the Titan-Centaur, could just barely catch the old Grand Tour trajectory and encounter Uranus. Two weeks later, *Voyager 1* would leave on an easier and much faster trajectory, visiting Jupiter and Saturn only. *Voyager 1* would arrive at Jupiter four months ahead of *Voyager 2*, then arrive at Saturn nine months earlier. Hence, the second spacecraft launched was *Voyager 1*, not *Voyager 2*. The two Voyagers would arrive at Saturn nine months apart, so that if *Voyager 1* failed to achieve its Saturn objectives, for whatever reason, *Voyager 2* still could be retargeted to achieve them, though at the expense of any subsequent Uranus or Neptune encounter.

I basically agree with your comment, but I am not sure you are right here.

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlatan), *A charlatan (also called swindler or mountebank) is a person practising quackery or some similar confidence trick in order to obtain money, fame or other advantages via some form of pretense or deception.* This would mean that *charlatan* and *con man* are not mutually exclusive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been contributing to /r/Epicureanism for more than two years now and have never tried shoving religion into here. I have never been religious and certainly never will. However, I also study other traditions and like to do comparisons, which helps with not becoming too ignorant. Your comment is furthermore close enough to my submission to have reasonable doubts that you actually read the linked academic article. So what's the point? </TEXT>

 Comparisons between western and eastern philosophies are uncommon and this, among other things, hinders global philosophical discourse. Thus, in this essay I want to compare the philosophies of the Buddha and Epicurus for similarities, particularly in regard to what I call negative happiness, or the belief that happiness is intimately connected with non-suffering. Ultimately, I will maintain that while this understanding of happiness is helpful, it remains inadequate. </TEXT>

(translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu)

 In every case where a family cannot hold onto its great wealth for long, it is for one or another of these four reasons. Which four? They don't look for things that are lost. They don't repair things that have gotten old. They are immoderate in consuming food and drink. They place a woman or man of no virtue or principles in the position of authority. In every case where a family cannot hold onto its great wealth for long, it is for one or another of these four reasons.

<TEXT> [**Thag 14.2: Godatta**](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/thag/thag.14.02.than.html)

(translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu)

    Just as a fine, well-bred bull
        yoked to a load,
        enduring his load,
                crushed
        by the heavy burden,
            doesn't throw down his yoke;
    so, too, those who are filled with discernment
         as the ocean, with water 
            don't look down on others.
    This is nobility among beings.

    Having fallen in time
        under the sway of time,
    having come under the sway
        from becoming   non-,
    people fall subject to pain
              they grieve.

    Elated by the causes of pleasure,
      cast down by causes of pain,
    fools are destroyed by both,
    not seeing them for what they are.
    While those who, in the midst of
        pleasure   pain
    have gone past the seamstress of craving,
    stand firm
        like a boundary pillar,
        neither elated nor cast down.

    Not to gain or loss
    not to status or honor,
    not to praise or blame,
    not to pleasure or pain:
        everywhere
    they do not adhere 
        like a water bead
        on a lotus.
        Everywhere
    they are happy, the enlightened,
        everywhere
            un-
        defeated.

    No matter what
        the unrighteous gain
        or the righteous loss,
    righteous loss is better
        than if there were unrighteous gain.
    No matter what
        the status of the unaware
        or the lowliness of those who know,
    the lowliness of those who know
                is better,
        not the status of those
        unaware.
    No matter what
        the praise from fools
        or the censure from those who know,
    the censure from those who know
                is better
        than if there were praise
        from fools.
    And as for the pleasure
        from sensuality
    and the pain from seclusion,
        the pain from seclusion
                is better
        than if there were pleasure
        from sensuality.
    And as for living through unrighteousness
    and dying for righteousness,
        dying for righteousness
                is better,
        than if one were to live
        through unrighteousness.

    Those who've abandoned
        sensuality   anger,
        whose minds are calmed
        from becoming   non-,
    go through the world
                unattached.
    For them there is nothing
            dear or undear.
    Developing
        the factors for Awakening,
        faculties,
          strengths,
    attaining the foremost peace,
    without fermentation, they
        are entirely
        Unbound. </TEXT>

    The Dhamma protects
    those who live by the Dhamma.
    The Dhamma well-practiced
        brings bliss.
    This  the reward
    when the Dhamma's well-practiced:
    one who lives by the Dhamma
    doesn't go to a bad destination.

    For Dhamma and non-
    don't bear equal results.
    Non-Dhamma leads you to hell;
    Dhamma, to a good destination.

    So you should engender desire
    for acts of Dhamma,
    rejoicing
    in the One  Well-gone,
    the one     who is Such.
    Standing firm in the Dhamma,
    of the foremost
    One Well-gone,
    his disciples are guided
     enlightened 
    to the foremost
    refuge supreme.

    Burst       is the root of the boil;
    the net of craving  uprooted.
    He, having ended his wandering-on,
    has no stain 
    like the moon
    on a clear full-moon night. </TEXT>

    Rain soddens what's covered
      doesn't sodden what's exposed.
    So open up what's covered up,
    so that it won't get soddened by the rain.

    Attacked by death
        is the world,
    surrounded by aging,
    beset by the arrow of craving,
    always obscured by desire.

    Attacked by death
        is the world,
      encircled by aging,
    constantly beaten, with no shelter,
        like a thief
    sentenced to punishment.

    They encroach like masses of flame,
        these three:
        death, aging,   illness.
    There's no strength to confront them,
    no speed to run away.

    Make the day not-in-vain,
        a little or a lot.
    However much
    the day passes,
    that's how much less
        is life.
    Your last day approaches.
        This isn't your time

(translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu)

    Overwhelmed with grief for my son 
        naked, demented,
        my hair dishevelled
        my mind deranged 
    I went about here   there,
    living along the side of the road,
    in cemeteries   heaps of trash,
        for three full years,
    afflicted with hunger   thirst.

    Then I saw
    the One Well-gone,
    gone to the city of Mithila:
        tamer of those untamed,
        Self-Awakened,
        with nothing to fear
        from anything, anywhere.

    Regaining my mind,
    paying him homage,
        I sat myself down.
    He, Gotama, from sympathy
    taught me the Dhamma.
    Hearing his Dhamma,
    I went forth into homelessness.
    Applying myself to the Teacher's words,
    I realized the state of auspicious bliss.

    All griefs have been cut off,
        abandoned,
        brought to this end,
    for I've comprehended
    the grounds from which griefs
    come into play. </TEXT>

 Although arising in different cultural contexts, Stoicism and the Daoism of the Daodejing characterize the life of their wise man, or Sage, in surprisingly similar ways. Both see persons as integral parts of the world, who fulfill their natures as individuals by harmonizing their experiences, thoughts, and actions with the natural or cosmic context in which they are embedded.

(translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu)


    Twenty five years since my going forth,
    and no peace of awareness
     not a finger-snap's worth 
        attained.
    Having gained no oneness of mind,
    I was wracked with lust.
    Wailing, with my arms upheld,
    I ran amok from my dwelling 
    "Or... or shall I take the knife?
    What's the use of life to me?
    If I were to renounce the training,
    what sort of death would I have?"

    So, taking a razor,
    I sat down on a bed.
    And there was the razor,
    placed ready to cut my own vein,
        when apt attention arose in me,
    the drawbacks appeared,
        disenchantment stood
        at an even keel:

    With that, my heart was released.
    See the Dhamma's true rightness!
    The three knowledges
    have been attained;
    the Awakened One's bidding,
            done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Epictetus was a great teacher and his lectures, as far as they have survived, belong to the most fascinating texts ever. The *Enchiridion* is a collection of short passages taken from his lectures and for someone knowing the lectures a great tool for bringing Epictetus' teaching into memory.

That being said, many people enjoy the *Enchiridion* for itself. Although there is nothing wrong with that, knowledge of the lectures makes it more valuable and more understandable. A lot of critiques and misunderstandings comes from not knowing or ignoring the broader context of Epictetus' lectures. </TEXT>

        tamed, calmed, living in tune,
        released through right gnosis,
        Such?

    You make things worse
    when you flare up
    at someone who's angry.
    Whoever doesn't flare up
    at someone who's angry
        wins a battle
        hard to win.

    You live for the good of both
         your own, the other's 
    when, knowing the other's provoked,
        you mindfully grow calm.

    When you work the cure of both
         your own, the other's 
    those who think you a fool
    know nothing of Dhamma.

    If anger arises,
    reflect on the saw simile. [See MN 21] 
    If craving for savor,
    remember the son's-flesh simile. [See SN 12.63] 

    If your mind runs loose
    after sensual pleasures
      states of becoming,
    quickly restrain it with mindfulness
    as you would a bad ox
    eating grain. [See MN 19] </TEXT>

<TEXT> Laughter is not foreign to Stoics. Chrysippus, about whom the ancient said But for Chrysippus, there had been no Porch, literally laughed so heartily that he died:

 Another account is that his death was caused by a violent fit of laughter; for after an ass had eaten up his figs, he cried out to the old woman, Now give the ass a drink of pure wine to wash down the figs. And thereupon he laughed so heartily that he died.

<TEXT> I am very sorry for your chronic illness and it's great that you have found something which helps you to live with it and wish you the best. I did not intend to offend anyone and certainly none who cannot become a monk due to illness. That being said, I am no monk either and, as far as I can tell, I won't ever become one. If I sounded too judgemental too lay people, I am one of the targets myself.

My comment was thought as response to the mentioned urgency and the luck of becoming human as it is described in the [Chiggala Sutta](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.048.than.html) which I read shortly before (it was linked in this subreddit recently, if my memory is right).

<TEXT>  The article doesn't mention it, but he was a very committed Buddhist who lived at the Mt. Baldy Zen Zen Center for several years.

The article mentions it:

 Mr. Cohen, raised Jewish and observant throughout his life, became interested in Zen Buddhism in the late 1970s and often visited the Mount Baldy monastery, east of Los Angeles. Around 1994, he abandoned his music career altogether and moved to the monastery, where he was ordained a Buddhist monk and became the personal assistant of Joshu Sasaki, the Rinzai Zen master who led the center, who died in 2014. He took the name Jikan, which means silence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it must not remain unmentioned that I actually like your post and appreciate it. It's just that your definition is not the Stoic's definition, according to my understanding. This does not need to be bad at all. The Stoic understanding of virtue was criticized a lot in ancient times.

There is also a reason why there are different types of ethics (consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics) and discussing and comparing them is interesting. My personal preference, however, has become virtue ethics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am with /u/skip_hunter, this understanding of virtue actually opposes Stoicism. The Stoics defined virtue very differently to your definition and also to those other ancient philosophic schools. I think that /u/MinotaurWarrior defined quite well in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/5agbgf/what_is_virtue_to_you/d9gcjr6/) how we may understand virtue without sacrificing too much:

 Living in accord with nature. Meaning, living at peace with the universe, and living according to the high ideals of the writ deep within yourself.

 This manifests itself in courage (the acceptance of all things that come), temperance (the acceptance of all things that do not come), justice (the recognition of ones' place in relation to others, and the associated duties), and wisdom (awareness of what all of the above mean)

In fact, it's even more complicated, since one is either virtuous or not without anything in between. Only the Stoic sage is virtuous and it is virtually impossible to become a Stoic sage. However, there are differences in how advanced prokoptons are. It's a life-long journey. For more info, you may read Julia Annas' article [Is Stoic Virtue as Off-Putting as it Seems?](http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/stoicismtoday/2016/11/05/is-stoic-virtue-as-off-putting-as-it-seems-by-julia-annas/) I have posted here recently. </TEXT>

It seems that my comment was too unclear (I'm no native speaker). Speed and efficiency being the most important parts of Buddhism certainly is not what I believe (and wanted to communicate). I answered to /u/Meditativo's comment

 Do not waste this rare and fortunate opportunity! Remember to have a sense of seriousness and urgency in your practice too, you never know how much longer this opportunity will be available to you...

which is not the first time I have read something like that. If this argument is to be taken dead seriously, then it is reasonable to do what makes one attain nirvana the most promising way, which seems to include becoming a monk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even in Buddha's time lay people rarely attained nirvana and becoming a monk was significantly more efficient than staying lay people. I don't think that this has changed much.

Since you are right, according to Buddhist teachings (as far as I have understood them), one may take the fortunate opportunity, become a monk, and practice Buddhism as sincerely as possible. It's certainly much easier as monk.

I know there are a lot of sincere lay people and don't say it's wrong not to become a monk. But in a way this may be seen as inconsistency. So why not become a monk? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  **Abstract:**

 The idea of gratitude () appears, both explicitly and by implication, in many Epicurean texts.  I propose that Epicureans think of gratitude as an important virtue of character, directed at no particular benefactor, but distinguishing the best kind of human life. In particular, it represents the proper disposition or mental stance toward the goods in ones life.  As a virtue, it is a state one must cultivate, through daily habits of reflection. With this virtue, one is able to maintain the proper attitude toward the objects of ones desires, thus avoiding unnatural, empty desires that make a life of  impossible. </TEXT>

        I was
    drunk with the intoxication

    Drunk with the intoxication
    of my body's build, coloring,   form,
    I wandered about,
    regarding no one
    as my equal or better,
        foolish, arrogant, haughty,
        my banner held high.
    I  disrespectful, arrogant, proud 
    bowed down to no one,
    not even mother,
            father,
    or those commonly held
    in respect.

    Then  seeing the ultimate leader,
    supreme, foremost of charioteers,
        like a blazing sun,
    arrayed with a squadron of monks 
    casting away pride   intoxication
    through an awareness serene   clear,
        I bowed down
        my
        head
    to him, supreme
    among all living beings.

    Haughtiness   contempt
        have been abandoned
         rooted out 
    the conceit "I am" is extracted,

<TEXT> Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations* was not intended as systematic introduction to Stoicism for the 21st century. It is the personal philosophical notebook of an ancient Stoic containing reflections, affirmations and the like. It's the result of someone's personal spiritual practice.

Personal reflections are of a different nature than lectures, essays and letters. Therefore, the *Meditations* is certainly not of the same kind as Epictetus lectures or Senecas essays and letters which were directed to other people than only the author himself.

I don't agree that Epictetus and Seneca wrote better material. They wrote different material. If one is looking for more systematic texts, Epictetus and Seneca are the authors to be preferred indeed, but that's simply due to the nature of personal reflections. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The alleged violation of Occam's razor is not the only detail which puzzled me, it's also his reference to being a scientist which makes him reject pantheism and panpsychism. Curiously, some of the best scientists (Albert Einstein, for example) believed in the god of Spinoza. I am currently reading an excellent book by the biologist Stuart A. Kauffman who is a further example of someone not sharing Pigliucci's opinion.

<TEXT> [**Abstract:**](https://www.academia.edu/26340894/N%C4%81g%C4%81rjunas_Pa%C3%B1cako%E1%B9%ADi_Agrippas_Trilemma_and_the_Uses_of_Skepticism)

 While the contemporary problem of the criterion raises similar epistemological issues as Agrippas Trilemma in ancient Pyrrhonian skepticism, the consideration of such epistemological questions has served two different purposes. On one hand, there is the purely practical purpose of Pyrrhonism, in which such questions are a means to reach suspension of judgment, and on the other hand, there is the theoretical purpose of contemporary epistemologists, in which these issues raise theoretical problems that drive the search for theoretical resolution. In classical India, similar issues arise in Ngrjunas Vigrahavyvartan, but it is not entirely clear what Ngrjunas purpose is. Contrary to the theoretical interpretations of several recent scholars such as Jan Westerhoff according to which Ngrjuna is proffering a contextualist epistemological theory, I argue that Ngrjuna as well as the later Madhyamaka Candrakrti, much like Pyrrhonian skeptics, employed concerns about epistemic criteria in service of purely practical purposes. There is no positive epistemological theory to be found in Ngrjunas Vigrahavyvartan and Candrakrtis Prasannapad; furthermore a putative thesis of universal emptiness is self-undermining, a conclusion which itself can be seen as part of a therapeutic program. Nonetheless, the historical persistence of these epistemological issues shows that they ought to continue to be areas of theoretical inquiry for epistemologists today. I end with reflections on the wider relevance of my conclusions, particularly with regard to demonstrating the value of philosophy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Most don't believe in Zeus.

You are certainly right that modern Stoics dismiss much of ancient Stoicism, too, which makes calling oneself a Stoic somehow problematic, because all divisions of Stoic philosophy (physics, logic, ethics) were regarded as unity by the ancient Stoics (which makes sense). However, Stoic theology did not require literally believing in a deity called Zeus. The god of the Stoics may be described best as pantheistic.  </TEXT>

I fully agree to your comment. That makes me feel suspicious, too, and that the three 'superior' philosophies which Buddhism 'can't hold a candle to' are so strongly different from each other makes me feel even more suspicious. The philosophies being involved in the comparison also seem to be a bit arbitrary. Most often such people have not studied any of the involved philosophies thoroughly (or are just trolling). </TEXT>

Do you like more academic books? *Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life* by Anthony A. Long and *The Inner Citadel* by Pierre Hadot certainly belong to the best books about Stoicism. Robertson is an easier read. Long and Hadot, however, go deeper into Stoic philosophy. </TEXT>

I fully agree that using Stoic concepts for gaining success in externals cannot be called Stoicism anymore. Stoicism, however, is not even about happiness, it is really all about virtue. The Stoics say that by living according to virtue one may eventually be happy, but that's not the goal either. The point is, that as soon as virtue is not the sole good, something is not Stoicism. </TEXT>

At the end it depends on which kind of ethics one subscribes to. An utilitarian may say that this kind of research helps so many people such that the positives outweigh the negatives by far, even if that involves killing of animals.

Buddhist ethics, however, is no utilitarian ethics, it is an example of virtue ethics. Researching ways of healing cancer and the like certainly is a very good intention indeed, but killing animals is still vicious. Inasmuch good intentions can outweigh the viciousness of killing animals may be debatable. However, as soon as one doubts doing the right thing, it is certainly better to not do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I know, Commodus is not being seen in a positive light today either (and that's not what I claimed anyway). However, more is known about the bias and unreliability of the few existing sources than two centuries ago, for example. This and the research of more than two centuries in general cause historians see things more differentiatedly in many areas.

Today I have begun reading Anthony R. Birley's biography of Marcus Aurelius and he discusses exactly that problem at the beginning of the book. I want to give a very short summary of the discussion of those sources which are the same as regarding Commodus.

Cassius Dio, for example, was the main source for Gibbon's extremely bad picture of Commodus. According to Birley, Cassius Dio (like others) loved Marcus and hated Commodus. Although he does not appear to distort facts unduly, he was very biased in favor of Marcus and against Commodus. (I remember reading elsewhere, that the wickedness of Commodus was tendentially being exaggerated in order to let Marcus appear even greater, but I unfortunately forgot the historian's name who wrote that, so please take that with a grain of salt.)

Another well-known source is the *Augustan History* portraying the emperors from Hadrianus to Carinus. We know that the alleged authors did not even exist and that a lot of citations of documents are bogus and the work of the (unknown) authors of the *Augustan History*.

The historical works of Marius Maximus, Herodian and few others contain some useable material about the major emperors like Marcus, but are completely fictional elsewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cato was a famous role model for the ancient Stoics and certainly worth being studied. Therefore, I was quite delighted to see that Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni wrote a biography of Cato  *Rome's Last Citizen: The Life and Legacy of Cato, Mortal Enemy of Caesar*. I ordered the book soon after reading this [interview with Jimmy Soni](http://dailystoic.com/jimmy-soni-interview/), which was how I became aware of the book.

Fortunately, Massimo Pigliucci published a series of articles about the book on his blog which is quite interesting for those who want to learn more about Cato:

I have read two of Donald Robertson's books (*The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy* and *Teach Yourself Stoicism and the art of Happiness*), which I like and usually recommend as modern introductions to Stoicism. I also liked the previous handbooks and expect the new one to be at least as good. But I think that calling it perfect may not be the most virtuous thing to do (though I noticed the question mark).

Personally, I think that Epictetus' *Enchiridion* and *Discourses*, Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, and Seneca's *Essays* and *Letters to Lucilius* are a lot nearer to perfection than all modern introductions. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I was leaning toward virtue ethics before I took a serious look at Stoicism anyway, because I am convinced that philosophy ought to be practiced, it cannot just be an exercise in logic chopping. And Stoicism offers a beautifully constructed, yet sufficiently flexible, system of thought that can guide ones life day by day.

Very well said! Thanks for posting the interesting interview.

 We may use iPhones rather than parchment to take our notes on, but it seems like human nature hasnt changed that much, for better or for worse. Thats why Stoicism (and its Eastern equivalent, as Ive come to think of it, Buddhism) is still very much relevant today.

Buddhist ethics is certainly another example of virtue ethics and Buddhism may share some teachings with Stoicism indeed. But one should not forget about the context of the similarities within each tradition and about what sets Buddhism and Stoicism apart from other religions and philosophies and, of course, from each other.

That being said, I have some some doubts about Buddhism and Stoicism being equivalents, but I would be very interested in Massimo Pigliucci's reasons for coming to think of Buddhism that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stoicism has basically ceased to exist as school with the death of Marcus Aurelius. It has been studied and adapted from then until today though. Unfortunately, we don't know exactly how it was lived and how it was taught, apart from transcripts of some lectures of Epictetus. There is a difference between how a philosophy or religion is actually lived and what we would expect from studying its theory. /u/cleomedes has written an [excellent comment about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/555lbv/the_dark_side_of_buddhism/d89j9qk).

The purest form of Stoicism may be found in the original works which have survived. Generally, I prefer reading Seneca, Epictetes and Marcus Aurelius and some other ancient works to modernizations. I also like reading more academic works like Anthony A. Long's *Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life* and Pierre Hadot's *The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Simple living can be described as being satisfied with what one has for different reasons like having more time for one's family or increasing the quality of one's life, for example. This may include self-sufficiency, minimalism or asceticism, but that does not need to be necessarily the case. That is, one can have a perfectly simple life without minimalism. Minimalism can even be a trap, especially if it is being done obsessively. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is a great comment and an enlightening point. Many thanks!

In this context it may be interesting to study the reception history as described, for example, in Donald S. Lopez's books [*From Stone to Flesh: A Short History of the Buddha*](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo5904832.html) and especially in [*The Scientific Buddha: His Short and Happy Life*](http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300159127/scientific-buddha) ([here](http://info-buddhism.com/Scientific_Buddha_Lopez.html) is a short article by the author). In this case it is about a living tradition. Stoicism, however, ceased to exist as active philosophy long ago. The more relevant is your skepsis:

 This is part of why I am a bit skeptical of how well modern reconstructions of Stoic practice in daily life actually match historical Stoicism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are so many problems, I am going to concentrate on only three. I asked if you read the article, because they are so obvious.

It begins with Buddhism being nihilistic. That's not true, Buddhism was thought to be nihilistic by some very early interpreters like Nietzsche when not much was known about Buddhism, but it is not nihilistic and Buddha rejected nihilism (and eternalism).

He gives a disturbing anecdote which may have happened like that or not (maybe it was only a bad joke by a monk). But anecdotes are just anecdotes and do not tell that much as he wants his readers to believe. The way he uses the anecdote is not sound. And why is he talking about the soul and the reincarnation of a soul all the time? One of the most known teachings of Buddhism is that there is nothing like what we typically understand as soul. He himself criticizes exactly that later in the article. The Buddhist understanding of karma is also completely different to his more New Age-like understanding.

Among all other problems it is also disturbing how he quotes the Dalai Lama and interpretes the (shortened) quote as malignly as possible. He is completely wrong that one has to take exactly one meditation posture precisely, since there are many different meditation postures in the Buddhist countries and virtually no one makes his claims.


That being said, there are some superficial similarities and teachings Buddhism and Stoicism have in common. Buddhist and Stoic ethics are both examples of virtue ethics. There are also some interesting articles like *Roman Buddha* by William Ferraiolo which compare Buddhism and Stoicism more broadly than I am able to.

I don't think that Buddhism and Stoicism are related. Buddhism may have had some influence on Pyrrhonism, but even that is speculative. The similarities have to be seen in relation to their position and function within both traditions, which is not being done most often. </TEXT>

Why should there be a weekly thread for that? This is the regular content of this subreddit and posting the content, which is being posted in one thread for each topic now, in a single weekly thread instead does not add anything but chaos. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are not doing that weekly, because we are doing that all the time: What you describe is already the regular content and it is the major part of this subreddit. Collecting the regular content in one weekly thread would be extremely confusing and chaotic. There is a good reason for creating single threads.

These weekly threads are almost always actions of moderators to collect recurring posts of the same type into one single thread, such that they don't annoy people by being posted separatedly. I don't think that the mentioned kind of discussions are annoying, they are simply the regular content of this subreddit.

There are also not so many posts by people advertizing their own blogs. Actually, I know of only one person advertizing for Stoic Week who does just that and not much more than that. Most of us (like me) share articles they find interesting. That's what reddit is for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are more reasons for contemplating death, but one reason is time and how to get the most out of life.

 Every moment that I am alive, I know that my life will continue into the next moment.

I am surprised to read that, because I don't know how much of my time is left and I am quite sure you don't know when you are going to die either.

Contrarily to common belief, death is of concern to us every moment of our lives:

 What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands. ([Seneca](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_1))

Time is ours and it is precious and we don't know how much of it we have. Therefore, we shall use it carefully and be greedy with it. A large portion of our life passes while we are spoiling our precious time.

According to Seneca, learning to live is learning to die.

 There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living: there is nothing that is harder to learn. Of the other arts there are many teachers everywhere; some of them we have seen that mere boys have mastered so thoroughly that they could even play the master. It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, andwhat will perhaps make you wonder moreit takes the whole of life to learn how to die. ([Seneca](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/seneca_younger/brev_e.html))

Contemplation of death is not about death, it is about getting the most out of our lives. I highly recommend studying Seneca's [On the Shortness of Life](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/seneca_younger/brev_e.html) in that regard.

 So it isthe life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it. Just as great and princely wealth is scattered in a moment when it comes into the hands of a bad owner, while wealth however limited, if it is entrusted to a good guardian, increases by use, so our life is amply long for him who orders it properly. ([Seneca](http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/seneca_younger/brev_e.html))

Another reasons are [the terrors of death](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_4) and [how to despise death](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_24). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I think it's not only interesting what Massimo Pigliucci likes about them, but also what you like about them.

Shortly after submitting my post I had to leave to attend an interesting event, which prevented me from being the (supposed) first to answer my question. I am going to catch up now.

It was quite interesting to read Massimo Pigliucci's preferences. Personally, I like Seneca for nearly the same reasons and I can only repeat most of the article in this regard.

Epictetus' *Enchiridion* is excellent, but I prefer his discourses so much. Reading them feels like actually listening to a really great teacher. I love his approach to philosophy, his humor, his Socratic style of teaching and I wished I could attend his lectures. I am so grateful for being able to experience his lectures at least this way.

Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations* is the book I carry with me most of the time when I am on the way. It may not be as polished as Seneca's works and it is also so different to Epictetus' discourses. It is the philosophical diary of an experienced Stoic with so many philosophical thoughts and struggles. My fascination is growing the more I am studying this book. I learn so much from him. It is also somehow comforting that even an experienced Stoic like Marcus Aurelius writes [a passage like this](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Thoughts_of_the_Emperor_Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus/Book_IV):

 Thou wilt soon die, and thou art not yet simple, nor free from perturbations, nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things, nor kindly disposed towards all; nor dost thou yet place wisdom only in acting justly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/loversclub quoted Epictetus:

 Don't explain your philosophy. Embody it.

And that's certainly the best advice. Making other people change is not within your control. Better concentrate on what is within your control, your judgements, opinions, thoughts, knowledge of Stoicism. You are also wrong in thinking that diplomas in education are stupid. They are not. Not using them virtuously is stupid.

Explaining your philosophy may make things even worse. You may have misunderstood something and therefore explain parts of Stoicism fatally wrong. Your actions may be perceived contrarily to your explanations by others, too. However, even if that is not the case at all, for clueless people Stoicism may be a little bit strange at first. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  [**Cynicism**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p003k9js)

 Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Cynics, the performance artists of philosophy. Eating live octopus with fresh lupins, performing intimate acts in public places and shouting at passers by from inside a barrel is behaviour not normally associated with philosophy. But the Cynics were different. They were determined to expose the meaninglessness of civilised life by action as well as by word. They slept rough, ate simply and gave their lectures in the market place. Perhaps surprisingly, their ideas and attitudes were immensely popular in the ancient world. But how coherent was cynicism as a philosophy? What was its influence on literature and politics and is there any truth to the contention that Jesus himself was influenced by the Cynics? With Angie Hobbs, Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Warwick; Miriam Griffin, Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford; John Moles, Professor of Latin, University of Newcastle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/28366049/Epicurus_Father_of_the_Enlightenment)

 Epicurus (341-270 BC) was, with Plato and Aristotle, one of the three great philosophers of the ancient world. He developed an integrated system of ethics and natural philosophy that, he claimed and many accepted, showed everyone the way to a life of the greatest happiness. The school that he founded remained open for 798 years after his death. While it lost place during the last 200 of these years, his philosophy held until then a wide and often decisive hold on the ancient mind.

 The revival of Epicureanism in the 17th century coincided with the growth of scientific rationalism and classical liberalism. There can be no doubt these facts are connected. It may, indeed, be argued that the first was a leading cause of the second two, and that we are now living in a world shaped, in every worthwhile sense, by the ideas of Epicurus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the original article: R Zhang, M Asai, C E Mahoney, M Joachim, Y Shen, G Gunner, J A Majzoub. **Loss of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone markedly reduces anxiety behaviors in mice.** *Molecular Psychiatry*, 2016; [DOI: 10.1038/mp.2016.136](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp2016136a.html)

 **Abstract**

 A long-standing paradigm posits that hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) regulates neuroendocrine functions such as adrenal glucocorticoid release, whereas extra-hypothalamic CRH has a key role in stressor-triggered behaviors. Here we report that hypothalamus-specific Crh knockout mice (Sim1CrhKO mice, created by crossing Crhflox with Sim1Cre mice) have absent Crh mRNA and peptide mainly in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) but preserved Crh expression in other brain regions including amygdala and cerebral cortex. As expected, Sim1CrhKO mice exhibit adrenal atrophy as well as decreased basal, diurnal and stressor-stimulated plasma corticosterone secretion and basal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, but surprisingly, have a profound anxiolytic phenotype when evaluated using multiple stressors including open-field, elevated plus maze, holeboard, lightdark box and novel object recognition task. Restoring plasma corticosterone did not reverse the anxiolytic phenotype of Sim1CrhKO mice. Crh-Cre driver mice revealed that PVHCrh fibers project abundantly to cingulate cortex and the nucleus accumbens shell, and moderately to medial amygdala, locus coeruleus and solitary tract, consistent with the existence of PVHCrh-dependent behavioral pathways. Although previous, nonselective attenuation of CRH production or action, genetically in mice and pharmacologically in humans, respectively, has not produced the anticipated anxiolytic effects, our data show that targeted interference specifically with hypothalamic Crh expression results in anxiolysis. Our data identify neurons that express both Sim1 and Crh as a cellular entry point into the study of CRH-mediated, anxiety-like behaviors and their therapeutic attenuation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  it should not really be of concern given that it is indifferent?

"indifferent" is not the same as "bad". I cannot add much to /u/cleomedes' comment, but I want to mention that the classification of pleasure may be a little bit more complicated, [according to Jan Edward Garrett](http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/stoa/stovals.htm#indif) (I have highlighted the passage bold which I am referring to):

 The Greek word "*hedone*" is ambiguous. On the one hand, it represents a class of passions or emotions and falls under the class of evil things. There I have translated it "delight." On the other hand, it represents physical pleasure. **Some ancient reporters regarding Stoicism place physical pleasure among the preferred indifferents; others say that it has some positive value but not enough to be included even among the preferred indifferents.** Cicero is aware of the distinction between these two meanings of "*hedone*," translating it as "*laetitia*" (delight) when he means the emotion, as "*voluptas*" (pleasure) when he means physical pleasure. </TEXT>

There may be a limit indeed which is reached when too many other important things are left undone otherwise. Pleasure per se is no reason for a limit. It is wise to use indifferents in a way that they contribute to virtue. Pleasure which contributes to virtue is fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://epicurussite.wordpress.com/2016/08/26/science-meaning-spirituality/)

 PP theorists frequently cite the virtue ethics of Aristotle; for example,  Wong (2011) explicitly references him in the context of a proposed PP 2.0 model in which moral psychology will figure prominently. But Aristotle is not the only Ancient Greek to have created an ethical-therapeutic system. Epicurus of Samos (341-270 BCE) grounded his own therapeutic moral psychology on a secure knowledge of the natural world, for only by banishing fear of the gods and of death was the Epicurean able to attain tranquillity (ataraxia). Taking a modern neo-Epicurean perspective reminds us that the findings of the natural sciences ought to form the foundation of PP 2.0 moral-psychological theories. Specifically, the purposeless universe described by modern physics must be taken seriously by positive psychologists when using ambiguous and potenially ontologically-loaded terms such as meaning and spirituality. The resulting worldview, in which science and spirituality are carefully distinguished but nonetheless compatible, still offers scope for experiencing Wongs Chaironic happiness.

<TEXT> You do not have to behave like a statue, because you are no statue. You are allowed to be happy and to experience emotions in general as long as it does not interfer with virtue.

For someone who usually is a pretty reserved person, the contrast between an enthusiastic state of mind and the normal state seems high. Others, however, may not percieve your enthusiastic state of mind (or what they see of it from the outside, respectively) as extreme as you do. It may not be as bad as you think.

In the case it is really as bad as you think, you may remind yourself of the impermanency of all things and of enthusiastic states of mind in particular and try to enjoy them more quietly without making too many promisses. You may take your enthusiasm as an impulse for doing good to other people, though. But do not promise anything, do something! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stoicism does not free us from responsibility and it does not prevent us from standing up and continuing afterwards. Quite the opposite is the case! Stoicism is very much about taking responsibility. Feeling responsible for something which is not under our control can paralize us and prevent us from taking resposibility for what we actually are responsible for. Stoicism is very helpful indeed in that regard! </TEXT>

 When one is immersed into a particular philosophy or point of view it is always a good idea to hear some vigorous critique of it. This will help us maintain a critical attitude toward our own beliefs, and as a bonus it will allow us to practice the virtue of temperance, since people are apt to get seriously irritated when their positions are critiqued by others!

<TEXT>  Except that there has been a lot of advancement in philosophy since then, and Stoics seemed to consider themselves philosophers, first and foremost.

A philosopher has to be ready to question everything, also his own tradition. If that leads to rejecting too many Stoic core doctrines to call oneself a Stoic, then one will have to stop calling oneself a Stoic. That's a matter of intellectual honesty.

 IMO the main component that defines a Stoic is the values

No. Several non-Stoic philosophies share its core values, even opposing schools like Epicureanism. One has to look at what sets a philosophy apart from other philosophies, at what really defines a philosophy. In Stoicism that's virtue being the sole good, for example. </TEXT>

I have read that book, too, and do not remember any CBT aspect which I would call 'hardcore'. While I think that starting with the original texts is better than reading polular introductions, "Stoicism and the art of happiness" actually is quite a good popular introduction.

That being said, nothing can replace original texts. </TEXT>

I think it does, because it is simply not true what he claims in that regard. This is also no minor detail, because this concerns the message of what the whole book is about. I really wonder about Epicureanism's worth, when I see that its followers need falsehoods to promote it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ancient philosophy called *Stoicism* is the only real thing. There is no head of the school anymore, there is not even a school which could define the pure doctrine. Thus we have to either take Stoicism as it is or adopt it and develop it further in a reasonable manner. We know much more about science and philosophy has not ended with the death of Marcus Aurelius after all.

However, I think that Stoicism is still basically right. Its underlying science needs a major upgrade, of course, but otherwise we are basically talking about refinements.

<TEXT> The secularized Western version of Buddhism is very different to what Buddhists have been practicing for about 2500 years now and what scholars of Buddhism are writing about. It is this so-called secular Buddhism which is particularly similar to Stoicism in some ways.

But it is also right that different traditions from all over the world often have important parts in common and can complement each other to some degree. Studying different traditions thoroughly can be very rewarding, but be aware of generalizing too much after doing only superficial comparisons.

I think that participating in practices from other traditions is not wrong per se as long as they are not vicious and help being virtuous. We must, however, keep the balance right. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It is a comforting thought indeed. But it is also untrue.

We are talking about an ancient philosophy and our opinions cannot change the content of past philosophies. They had a certain knowledge of the world and they taught providence, which was an important part of their philosophy. There may be good reasons for not believing in certain interpretations of providence today indeed, but the truth is that the Stoics did believe in providence and that we are talking about an ancient philosophy.

 Bringing truth to the mind is a cental part of Stoicism - or at least that is my assumption.

Nobody is forcing one to call oneself a Stoic. One may add and remove parts from Stoicism and integrate parts of other philosophies for one own's worldview, but there is a certain point where we are not talking about Stoicism anymore. There is nothing wrong with eclecticism, giving something a wrong label is wrong. Just don't call yourself a Stoic - it's better to [keep one's identity small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) anyway.

 So modern Stoics should adopt scientific worldview, not false beliefs about creator God(s) or external meaning.

Ancient Stoics did not believe in creator God(s). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Things like unnecessary idle time distract us from living to our nature and thus are not virtuous.

You are certainly right, but I'm afraid, this can be misunderstood too easily... Human beings need idle time to work well. Seneca writes about that explicitely, but at the moment I cannot remember where. Inasmuch idle time helps us in being virtuous, it is a good thing. There can be too much idle time, but also not enough.

I just wanted to add that comment, because there are people who seem to think that idle time, pleasure and other indifferents like that were bad. However, considering indifferents as bad per se is not wiser than considering indifferents as good per se. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks. I have been thinking about that increasingly these days. Together with the Epicureans, the Stoics were the materialists of their age, and they identified *logos* with god nevertheless. I don't want to call it that way because of the obvious connotations, but it's still very important to me: not only does it belong to the logical basis of Stoicism, it is the reason why the Stoics believed in the principal equality of all humans. The reception history of Stoicism is fascinating in that regard, too. </TEXT>

I may add to the idea that writing down one's philosophy may be a good starting point for a philosophic journal like Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*.

Maybe you could have been a little bit more specific about *logos*. In my opinion, it is not self-evident that the cosmos can be explained rationally and that working mathematical models of the cosmos can be developed. It's like there is an inherent rationality of the cosmos, which is something the ancients called *logos*. Does that meet your understanding of *logos*? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have found this on the blog of Massimo Pigliucci and according to my understanding there is no trichotomy of control, I think it should be in fact a dichotomy, at least according to Epictetus.

On the other hand, we would do virtually nothing, if we did only what is under our control. This would not be in agreement with the teachings of Epictetus, who uses an example of an athlete who has to train much for a competition, if the athlete wants to win, although the result of the competition is outside of the athlete's control. The athlete has to pay a price to get a prize. Another one of Epictetus' examples is that of a politician.

A diagram like that has to simplify the Stoic teachings in some way, but it certainly should not be wrong, and in this case the diagram may be at least misleading in that regard, if I have understood it correctly. How, do you think, could it be improved? </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**

 This study explores the concern in Epicureanism to create brief renderings of its philosophical tenets. It is argued that although the Epicureans were characteristically apprehensive about simplifying their philosophy so that it would appeal to a broad audience, they utilized literary formats such as epitomes to allow new students and well-disposed outsiders to gain an overview of the philosophy. From around 15050 BCE evidence though emerges that some Epicureans produced heavily abridged and simplistic texts in order to promote the philosophy widely and to ease the induction of new recruits into the school. This study allows the character and intentions of this largely forgotten movement to emerge, and the potential this has for aiding our understanding of the dissemination of philosophy and intellectual ideas in antiquity to be highlighted. </TEXT>

Other people are busy because they chase after something which can be interpreted as illusion and forget to live. Near the end of a life full of being busy many realize what they have not experienced and complain about the shortness of life. But most often life is not too short, we are just wasting too much of it. Getting one's priorities straight can be hard indeed.

<TEXT> I agree that this particular difference is being overstressed quite often indeed, although it is not wrong.

 I believe it's often the Stoics who embraced a rather conservative outlook on society, since the actions of others and the whole social order are in Stoic terms not "up to us".

One has to distinguish between Stoics and those who are interested in Stoicism as a reservoir of self-help strategies. When I write "Stoicism", I mean the ancient philosophy and do not refer to the self-help industry at all. What you attribute to Stoicism may be true to the self-help people, but contradicts ancient Stoicism quite clearly, since we are social animals and have our duties towards society, according to Stoicism. Marcus Aurelius, for example, compares us to limbs of a single body which is humanity. We are just not responsible for other people's actions, but only for our own actions.

 Its interesting that, for example, the Roman Stoic Musonius Rufus claimed that not only men but women too should be educated in philosophy, but (correct me if I'm wrong) no female Stoic is recorded in antiquity.

There are not many sources at all for whole periods of ancient times and there is no surprise that we have no Roman sources in that regard, given the situation of Roman women. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it completely depends on how you use social media in particular and the internet in general.

However, don't fall into the trap of posting at reddit.com or elsewhere in order to collect karma.

According to my opinion, it is preferable to reduce one's online activity and be active in only as few sites as it is still possiple to use them virtuously.

<TEXT> A stone in a shoe is morally indifferent and therefore neither good nor bad, according to Stoicism. Therefore, leaving a stone in the shoe is neither virtous nor vicious. Since not having a stone in the shoe is preferable to having a stone in the shoe, a Stoic will eventually solve the problem, too, although it may be right to say that a stone in the shoe is a lesser problem to a Stoic than to an Epicurean.

On the other hand, a Stoic may use hardships like that for character training (cold showers are more typical than stones in shoes, though). But that does not mean that not solving problems is anything a Stoic subscribes to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my favorite German translation "compulsion" ("Zwang") is used instead of "necessity", which makes the passage more understandable to me. I guess it's a play of words of which we cannot be completely sure what it means, though.

It may mean that you are not forced to endure compulsions, because it's usually possible to avoid many compulsions by retracting oneself from a major part of social life or even to escape them completely by committing suicide. At least there are coping mechanisms for not having to live with compulsions.

I don't know for sure, if I'm right, but that's how I understand the quote. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Meditations makes a good entry point,  as does Epictetus's Enchiridion.

I second your recommendations, but I'm not convinced that Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations* is good as entry point; at least what I am concerned, my enjoyment of studying it has been increasing along with my growing knowledge of Stoicism. Learning the basics of Stoicism before reading Marcus Aurelius certainly makes sence, according to my own experience. I'd read Epictetus' *Enchiridion* (and maybe some of Seneca's works) first. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Anyone comparing payed labor to slavery is laughably ignorant of the truth of the horrors of slavery.

If you are refering to slavery in the south of the USA, you are completely right. In Ancient Rome the situation was much more complex: there were a lot of slaves living and working under extremely horrible circumstances like in mines, but there were also other slaves which can be compared to labor as we know it today indeed. It just depends on what Bukowski is thinking of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**

 In the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Trojan legend was one of the most popular myths in the European courts, and in the Burgundian court in particular. Thelegend was depicted in numerous tapestries and illuminated manuscripts. This article examines the image of Troy in Franco-Flemish illumination of the fifteenth century. I explore and interpret the iconography of Troy as a mental and semiotic construct linked to such real cities as Jerusalem, Rome, and Constantinople. I will examine images of the real cities and the ways in which they influenced the formation of Troys iconography, a connection overlooked in current scholarship. The research will therefore focus on the permanent architectural and landscape elements borrowed from real cities, which were mythologized and sacralized in the European tradition. Emphasis will be placed on the citys visual representation in the miniatures as influenced by literary materials (i.e. medieval manuscripts containing stories of Troy). My particular interest lies in how the image of Troy evolved simultaneously through a religious and political perspective. That is to say, I will pay particular attention to the cultural codes, the sacred topography and the contexts creating images of the nonexistent city. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think, this makes your position much clearer. I've to admit that I misunderstood your previous comment, too, but now I see your point and agree. Discussing with irrational people in a rational way can be very difficult and exhausting and rarely improves the situation indeed. This is also what I've experienced.

Nevertheless, there are some rare moments when irrational and close-minded people are more open than usual. Carefully and emotionally worded, but otherwise rational remarks (maybe even being placed apparently at random) may eventually show some positive effect. Trying to understand the reason for their irrational believes may help a lot, too. In the case of a close relative or friend there is some chance to help this way with a lot of patience (I've already seen the success of such a strategy). </TEXT>

[**New online ecology of adversarial aggregates: ISIS and beyond**](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6292/1459)

by N. F. Johnson, M. Zheng, Y. Vorobyeva, A. Gabriel, H. Qi, N. Velasquez, P. Manrique, D. Johnson, E. Restrepo, C. Song, S. Wuchty

 **Abstract**

 Support for an extremist entity such as Islamic State (ISIS) somehow manages to survive globally online despite considerable external pressure and may ultimately inspire acts by individuals having no history of extremism, membership in a terrorist faction, or direct links to leadership. Examining longitudinal records of online activity, we uncovered an ecology evolving on a daily time scale that drives online support, and we provide a mathematical theory that describes it. The ecology features self-organized aggregates (ad hoc groups formed via linkage to a Facebook page or analog) that proliferate preceding the onset of recent real-world campaigns and adopt novel adaptive mechanisms to enhance their survival. One of the predictions is that development of large, potentially potent pro-ISIS aggregates can be thwarted by targeting smaller ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cicero was an eclectic, but quite interesting for Stoics nevertheless.

One of Cicero's teachers was Philo of Larissa, the head of Plato's Academy. Consequently, Academic skepticism was also a philosophy Cicero subscribed to. However, he integrated Stoicism in his philosophical views and writings quite substantially and he was influenced by the Peripatetic philosophy as well.

*De Officiis*, which is one of Cicero's most famous and influential works, is said to be based on a book by the Stoic Panaetius. Cicero's work is also quite important, since he is one of our main sources for the philosophy of many Stoics whose works are lost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fully agree with /u/SigmaX about Seneca's *Letters to Lucilius* and have nothing to add. And I love the Socratic style of Epictetus' *Discourses*. These two books and Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations* don't leave many desires unfulfilled.

The *Enchiridion* is great, of course, and certainly the kind of text you may carry with you to have a text about the Stoic core teachings ready all the time. However, I personally think one should at least have read Seneca's *Letters* or *Essays* or Epictetus' *Discourses* first to get the most out of it. The same is true for Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*. It's one of my favorite books ever, but it's better to already know the basics of Stoicism before reading it for the first time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Marcus Aurelius compares us humans with being different body parts and together we form a whole body. Obviously, I fully agree with you that terroristic acts and other human catastrophes are of our concern indeed. Stoicism cannot be an excuse (or even a justification) for being ignorant, inactive and egocentric. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I've read that meditation is large part of applying Stoicism to your life

There is no broad consensus on how far something we know as meditation today is part of Stoic practice, but it's certainly no large part. Stoics are no Buddhist monks after all. I'd say that mindfulness meditation may fit best. Mindfulness is important to Stoics indeed and mindfulness meditation may strengthen that skill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Among the people I admire there are Christians and also people of other faiths or of no faith at all. I don't admire anyone because of one's faith (or lack of it), I admire good people.

I admire much of Christian art - paintings and sculptures and music like Haendel's oratories and Bach's cantatas -, however, not because of their Christian content (but also not despite it). I am fascinated by old cathedrals. The same could be said about the equivalents of other religions, but I am living in a Christian cultural area and therefore that's what I am familiar with.

The bible is interesting, too. I have read Genesis very often in several translations and that is also true for other parts of the bible. It's more a piece of literature to me than a religious text being the base of my faith, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the Renaissance there were a lot of humanists being influenced by Stoicism heavily. Among them were Lipsius and Grotius (I have linked an article by John Sellars about that some weeks ago). Stoicism also had a significant impact in the age of enlightment when a declaration of human rights were written by authors influenced by Stoicism.

Stoicism has influenced a lot of politicians and even kings like Frederick the Great, who is very well known in that regard (I have posted an article about him some while ago). According to his own statements, the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has studied Marcus Aurelius his whole life. I also remember that Obama named Marcus Aurelius as one of his most favorite books. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I found it interesting that monotheism was embraced by a divine Emporer

You are wrong in virtually all your statements about Stoicism and that's also the case here. Marcus Aurelius did not believe in a monotheistic god, but in a pantheistic one. In that regard he did not differ from all other ancient Stoics we know: all of them did not believe in a monotheistic god.

If you are seriously interested what we are discussing here, you may read a good introduction like [this one](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/) or [this one](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/) (both articles are entries of encyclopedias with high reputation). </TEXT>

However, they may eventually ask explicitly for what one stands for or what philosophy or religion one subscribes to.

This isn't only true for Stoicism, but for other philosophies and religions as well. It may be most obvious for Eastern philosophies, where there are some extreme examples in which some Western versions are virtually complete fictions. The wrong labels are highly problematic indeed.

 I am an eclectic who agrees with the Stoics on some important points, and enjoys studying and discussing even aspects I disagree with.

<TEXT>  Like anything else, watering down stoicism to make it palatable means you are not actually living like a stoic, you're living like you want to.

That is very well said!

 A counter argument is that even if everyone is practicing only half-assed stoicism, that's better than people not practicing it at all.

Usually people pick and choose some methods and teachings from Stoicism, but ignore the rest. I am not against ecclecticism and I agree that applying Stoic methods outside Stoicism can be very helpful indeed (there are even efficient psychotherapies which are based on that). But I see a problem in labelling the result of one's ecclecticism as Stoicism. In my opinion one really should not do that!

 Also practical stoicism is a journey.

I don't think that ancient Stoics would use exactly your words, but the concept is not foreign to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading Stoic texts regularly has become very important to me, I personally love Marcus Aurelius. His *Meditations* are the result of exactly the spiritual practice which is highly important for a Stoic. This kind of self-reflection helps a lot and we should practice it. Asking oneself what Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus would do can be helpful, too.

We are no Stoic sages, though. We lose focus more often than we should and when we regain focus, we should not be discouraged. Just returning to the path and analyzing the reasons for losing focus rationally helps a lot more than angering about one's failure.

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/9577317/The_Cyrenaics_on_Pleasure_Happiness_and_Future-Concern)

 The Cyrenaics assert that (1) particular pleasure is the highest good, and happiness is valued not for its own sake, but only for the sake of the particular pleasures that compose it; (2) we should not forego present pleasures for the sake of obtaining greater pleasure in the future. Their anti-eudaimonism and lack of future-concern do not follow from their hedonism, nor from their maximizing model of rationality (*contra* Annas), since the natural position to adopt if one has a maximizing hedonism is Socrates prudent hedonism, as described in the *Protagoras*. So why do they assert (1) and (2)? After reviewing and criticizing the proposals put forward by Irwin and Tsouna, I offer two possible reconstructions. In the first, I explain claim (1) as follows: happiness has no value above and beyond the value of the particular pleasures that compose it. Also, there is no structure to happiness. The Cyrenaics are targeting the thesis that happiness involves having the activities of ones life forming an organized whole, the value of which cannot be reduced to the value of the experiences within that life. I explain claim (2) as follows: a maximally pleasant life is valuable, but the best way to achieve it is to concentrate heedlessly on the present. In the second reconstruction, the good is radically relativized to ones present preferences. The Cyrenaics assert that we desire some *particular* pleasure, *e.g.*, the pleasure that results from having this drink now. Thus, our *telos*which is based upon our desiresis this *particular*  pleasure, not (generic) pleasure or the maximization of pleasure over our lifetime. As our desires change, so does our *telos*. I conclude that the scanty texts we have do not allow us to decide conclusively between these reconstructions, but I give some reasons to support the second over the first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apart from the study of the reception history of something, I don't value such compilations highly. They say more about the persons creating compilations than about the subject. Thus, the Jefferson Bible is interesting regarding the study of Jefferson and his understanding of Jesus, but not regarding the study of Jesus.

Jefferson may have seen something in Jesus indeed, but he had to pick and choose heavily. Concerning Jesus, I think that there may be some proximity to Cynism, but less so to Epicureanism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/25627889/Philodemus_and_Epicurean_Philosophy_Changing_Perceptions)

 This paper focuses on the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara (c. 110 BCE to c. 40 or 35 BCE), who lived and worked in Italy during the late Roman Republic. It examines the impact of his works, which were preserved by the first pyroclastic surge of Mount Vesuvius, on our understanding of Epicurean philosophy. Prior to their discovery in the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum in the 18th century, knowledge of Epicurean philosophy came from a very small number of extant Epicurean texts or from overtly hostile sources such as Cicero and Plutarch. Extant Epicurean sources, which included the account of Epicurus in Diogenes Laertius Lives of the Philosophers and Lucretius De rerum nature, did not provide a full picture of Epicurean doctrines, while hostile sources actively misrepresented the schools views. Owing to their fragmentary state, many of Philodemus works were little studied until the 1970s when Marcello Gigante began the Centro internazionale per lo studio dei papiri ercolanesi (C.I.S.P.E.). Since then, new editions and new technologies have made these difficult texts more accessible. Material from Philodemus, who wrote on a wide range of topics including death, rhetoric, music, poetry, logic, theology, epistemology, the history of philosophy and ethics, has thus changed perceptions of Epicurean philosophy. They have also provided insight into how Epicureans dealt with the competing claims of philosophy and a Roman context. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  some even referred to it as a "third baptism"

From the [Wikipedia article about Anabaptists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptists#Persecutions_and_migrations):

 Roman Catholics and Protestants alike persecuted the Anabaptists, resorting to torture and execution in attempts to curb the growth of the movement. The Protestants under Zwingli were the first to persecute the Anabaptists, with Felix Manz becoming the first martyr in 1527. On May 20, 1527, Roman Catholic authorities executed Michael Sattler. King Ferdinand declared drowning (called the *third baptism*) "the best antidote to Anabaptism". The Tudor regime, even the Protestant monarchs (Edward VI of England and Elizabeth I of England), persecuted Anabaptists as they were deemed too radical and therefore a danger to religious stability. The persecution of Anabaptists was condoned by ancient laws of Theodosius I and Justinian I that were passed against the Donatists, which decreed the death penalty for any who practiced rebaptism. Martyrs Mirror, by Thieleman J. van Braght, describes the persecution and execution of thousands of Anabaptists in various parts of Europe between 1525 and 1660. Continuing persecution in Europe was largely responsible for the mass emigrations to North America by Amish, Hutterites, and Mennonites. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The teachings of Epicureanism were rather stable during ancient times. There were not as many Epicurean philosophers than, for example, Stoic philosophers who refined and expanded the philosophy significantly.

There were some Epicurean poets like Lucretius and Horatius, though, but I am not sure whether calling them philosophers is correct. If these poets count as answer to your question, I will choose both of them. </TEXT>

[**Early Neanderthal constructions deep in Bruniquel Cave in southwestern France**](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7605/full/nature18291.html)

While those that do remain include red and black pigments and burial sites, these indications of modernity are extremely sparse and few have been precisely dated, thus greatly limiting our knowledge of these predecessors of modern humans. Here we report the dating of annular constructions made of broken stalagmites found deep in Bruniquel Cave in southwest France. The regular geometry of the stalagmite circles, the arrangement of broken stalagmites and several traces of fire demonstrate the anthropogenic origin of these constructions. Uranium-series dating of stalagmite regrowths on the structures and on burnt bone, combined with the dating of stalagmite tips in the structures, give a reliable and replicated age of 176.5 thousand years (2.1 thousand years), making these edifices among the oldest known well-dated constructions made by humans. Their presence at 336 metres from the entrance of the cave indicates that humans from this period had already mastered the underground environment, which can be considered a major step in human modernity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I'd start with our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq). It is not only a very recommendable introduction to Stoicism, it also offers good information about books, translations etc.

That being said, there is an excellent video introduction by Massimo Pigliucci: [Stoicism 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLLJP3H1FU). I also enjoy [Gregory B. Sadler's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/gbisadler) which contains a lot of interesting videos about Stoicism. Jan Edward Garrett's [The Stoic Place](http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/stoa/) offers a lot of good material, too. [Stoicism Today](http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/stoicismtoday/) is a good blog with some free courses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/11301216/Epicurus_on_Pleasure)

 The paper deals with the question of the attribution to Epicurus of the classication of pleasures into kinetic and static. This classication, usually regarded as authentic, confronts us with a number of problems and contradictions. Besides, it is only mentioned in a few sources that are not the most reliable. Following Gosling and Taylor, I believe that the authenticity of the classication may be called in question.

 The analysis of the ancient evidence concerning Epicurus concept of pleasure is made according to the following principle: rst, I consider the sources that do not mention the distinction between kinetic and static pleasures, and only then do I compare them with the other group of texts which comprises reports by Cicero, Diogenes Laertius and Athenaeus. From the former group of texts there emerges a concept of pleasure as a single and not twofold notion, while such terms as motion and state describe not two different phenomena but only two characteristics of the same phenomenon. On the other hand, the reports comprising the latter group appear to derive from one and the same doxographical tradition, and to be connected with the classication of ethical docrines put forward by the Middle Academy and known as the *divisio Carneadea*. In conclusion, I argue that the idea of Epicurus classication of pleasures is based on a misinterpretation of Epicurus concept in Academic doxography, which tended to contrapose it to doctrines of other schools, above all to the Cyrenaics views. </TEXT>

CBT is based on Stoicism and has proven effective. One may try techniques from CBT for oneself, but in your case I think I'd consider consulting a therapist. All of us need help sometimes and suicidal thoughts are a good sign that we need help indeed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the [article](https://www.academia.edu/1038463/Stoic_Practical_Philosophy_in_the_Imperial_Period):

 In what follows what I hope to do is to show the way in which the idea of a *philosophical exercise* played an important role in the understanding of philosophy in late Stoicism. I should stress that my reconstruction  drawing on material from a range of sources  is inevitably somewhat speculative. I should also note that although what I have to say will on the surface look quite similar to what Pierre Hadot has said about *spiritual exercises* in ancient philosophy, there are some important differences between his account and mine. Finally, I should make clear at the outset that the significance of the account I am about to give about philosophical exercises in late Stoicism is due to the way in which it enables us to approach certain late Stoic texts  in particular Epictetus *Handbook* and Marcus Aurelius *Meditations*  in a new light and consequently to re-assess their philosophical significance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**

 This paper is a plea for hedonism to be taken more seriously. It begins by charting hedonism's decline, and suggests that this is a result of two major objections: the claim that hedonism is the philosophy of swine, reducing all value to a single common denominator, and Nozick's experience machine objection. There follows some elucidation of the nature of hedonism, and of enjoyment in particular. Two types of theory of enjoyment are outlinedinternalism, according to which enjoyment has some special feeling tone, and externalism, according to which enjoyment is any kind of experience to which we take some special attitude, such as that of desire. Internalismthe traditional viewis defended against current externalist orthodoxy. The paper ends with responses to the philosophy of swine and the experience machine objections. </TEXT>

[Metaphysics of the Tea Ceremony: A Randomized Trial Investigating the Roles of Intention and Belief on Mood While Drinking Tea](http://library.noetic.org/library/publication-scholarly-papers/metaphysics-tea-ceremony)

By Dean Radin, PhD, and Yung-Jong Shiah, PhD

 **Abstract**

 Why does mother's homemade soup seem to taste better than what is nominally the same soup extracted out of a tin can? Besides the use of fresher and perhaps more nutritious ingredients, homemade soup offers a component that is absent from commercial soupsmother's nurturing intentions. Do such intentions matter? A previously reported study investigated this question by exposing samples of chocolate, a natural mood enhancer, to focused beneficial intentions, and then testing under double-blind conditions whether people eating the intentionally treated chocolate would report better mood as compared to people eating untreated chocolate from the same source. The study's outcome supported the intention-enhancement hypothesis.

<TEXT> I enjoyed your video very much!

That part was certainly meant as joke, but Austrians by far do not eat only Wiener Schnitzel, although it's one of the Austrian's favorite dishes indeed. It is usually eaten with potatoes and rice (some like to eat it with French fries), but never with spaghetti as shown in your excellent video. The traditional Austrian cuisine offers quite a wide range of dishes, many of them have their origin from all over the former monarchy (with goulash being one of the most important examples).

There are also many sweet dishes, for example all kinds of strudel (Apfelstrudel, Topfenstrudel, Marillenstrudel, Heidelbeerstrudel, Zwetschkenstrudel, Nussstrudel, Mohnstrudel etc.) which can be eaten as main dishes or as desserts, warm or cold, optional with vanilla sauce or whipped cream.

I know I have to stop now, your video is about music after all. </TEXT>

It's not about autonomy, which, by the way, is not taken away from someone at all just because assistance is not offered too easily. Assistance involves other people and therefore it cannot be only about the autonomy of the person being assisted.

That being said, the fact that someone wants to die does not make assistence automatically right. The question in which cases assistence is right is a tremendously difficult one raising many ethical and legal problems.

<TEXT>  I guess I just expected more *substance*.

I think that discussions within a group just about being against something are less interesting than such within groups about being for something. That's a sufficient reason why I do not participate in any of the atheism subreddits. And although there are good books about atheism and its arguments like *The Miracle of Theism* by John Leslie Mackie, most books being discussed in such subreddits are not what I'd call good literature. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Stoics argued that Virtue was defined by God.

The Stoic version of god is no theistic one as your description suggests. It is pantheistic and somehow similar (but not equal) to Spinoza's god. The Stoics were materialists and identified god with *logos* being one of the two first principles of the cosmos. For the Stoics *logos* was something like *universal reason* being immanent in nature and we humans share an especially big part of *logos*. Thus, being rational animals is our nature and that's why we shall cultivate wisdom. The other virtues are being derived in a similar manner.

It should be mentioned further, that the word *virtue* is the usual translation of the Greek word *arete*. However, *excellence of character* is a much better translation in the context of Stoicism. We know that technical terms like that are usually explained, but mostly left untranslated in academic literature, because there rarely exists a translation covering the whole semantic range of the original. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm asserting that people are motivated to seek pleasure and avoid pain and that the happiness promised by Stoicism is simply a higher form of pleasure (negative hedonism).

Stoic methods can be highly efficient for dealing with difficulties and challenges for non-Stoics, too. By applying teachings of Stoicism to one's life with the motivation to seek pleasure, however, one actually leaves Stoicism. That's hedonism and not even far away from Epicureanism indeed, but it certainly isn't what Stoicism is about.

 What motivates people to seek virtue if it is not a form of pleasure?

It's about *eudaimonia*, which is mostly translated as *human flourishing* or *happiness*. This is not a form of *hedone*, pleasure. These are distinct words with distinct meanings and neither of them is a form of the other.

Also don't forget, that these technical terms are mostly left untranslated in academic literature, because there is very rarely a translation covering the whole semantic range of the original. A sloppy usage of words leads to confusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  My question is whether Stoicism subscribes to the negative hedonism

This is quite trivial: Stoicism does not subscribe to any form of hedonism. According to Stoics, pleasure is a preferred indifferent and as such far from being *the* goal. Being a preferred indifferent, pleasure is allowed as long as it does not interfer with virtue, though, but, as I said, it cannot be the goal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ancient Stoics most probably didn't practice insight meditation as we know it from Buddhism. There were contacts between ancient Greece and India during Alexander the Great's military campaign, but I don't believe the ancient Stoics even knew Buddhist insight meditation nevertheless. We cannot know what they would have thought about it, if they knew it.

That being said, we are no ancient Stoics. There has been so much new philosophic and scientific insight since then, it's like living in a different world (although I don't think that human nature has changed much). What would Epictetus say, if he lived today? Unfortunately, we cannot know for sure. It is our task to bring Stoicism to life again while staying true to Stoic tradition.

According to my opinion, if insight meditation helps you with being virtuous, you may be well adviced to practice it. You may have to find the right balance, though. It certainly should not be a withdrawal from real life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The [original passage](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Thoughts_of_the_Emperor_Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus/Book_V) including its context is:

 Thou sayest, Men cannot admire the sharpness of thy wits.Be it so: but there are many other things of which thou canst not say, I am not formed from them by nature. Show those qualities then which are altogether in thy power, sincerity, gravity, endurance of labor, aversion to pleasure, contentment with thy portion and with few things, benevolence, frankness, no love of superfluity, **freedom from trifling, magnanimity**. Dost thou not see how many qualities thou art immediately able to exhibit, in which there is no excuse of natural incapacity and unfitness, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the mark? or art thou compelled through being defectively furnished by nature to murmur, and to be stingy, and to flatter, and to find fault with thy poor body, and to try to please men, and to make great display, and to be so restless in thy mind? No, by the gods; but thou mightest have been delivered from these things long ago. Only if in truth thou canst be charged with being rather slow and dull of comprehension, thou must exert thyself about this also, not neglecting it nor yet taking pleasure in thy dullness.

There is just a comma missing in your quote and this missing comma changes the meaning of that part tremendously.

<TEXT>  I personally disagree on the opinion, that without god there is no meaning and morality.

We know that opinion from theists and I am not convinced by that, either, at least not as long as 'god' is to be understood as usual.

The concept of god of the ancient Stoics, however, is not exactly that of a theistic god. The Stoics were materialists and identified god with *logos* which was one of the two first principles of the cosmos to them. For the Stoics *logos* was something like *universal reason* being immanent in nature and we humans share an especially big part of *logos*.

 I think humens can set their own rules of living a good life.

That's fine, but we are in a forum about Stoicism and therefore we usually discuss and favor the Stoic understanding of a good life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tattoos can be quite risky, [as we have seen lately](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/4ids3m/i_just_got_a_tattoo_of_what_i_thought_was/).

*Eudaimonia* is the goal in many ancient Greek philosophies, but they differ in how to achieve it. The Stoics thought that virtue (*arete*) was necessary and sufficient for *eudaimonia* and that all externals like health and wealth were indifferents. Aristotle did not agree that virtue was sufficient and considered what the Stoics called preferred indifferents as important for *eudaimonia*. 

It is very often translated as *happiness*, which comes close in a way, but also misses something of the original semantic range. It's difficult and maybe impossible to translate *eudaimonia* preserving its whole semantic range. In Academic literature it is therefore explained, but mostly left untranslated.

I think, [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) is quite good and is also linked to in our FAQ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stoicism is certainly compatible with Humanism and had a huge impact on Humanism in the Renaissance. Studying the history of Stoicism and its influence until today is quite interesting in that regard. When you read the Ancient Stoics' writings, you should know, however, that the Stoics' god is a pantheistic god, since they refer to god quite often. Their god is very similar to Spinoza's god and therefore not really incompatible even with Secular Humanism.

<TEXT> You are doing so many jumps that it feels like nailing a pudding on the wall. I am afraid we have to agree to disagree for now, if possible.

 What are your views on this subject? Epicurean, Buddhist, or Stoic?

After studying these three world views (and Christianity, since I am living where this is the most common religion), I have finally arrived at Stoicism lately. I value Epicurus highly and agree to many of his teachings, but I disagree that pleasure is the highest good. I don't share the rather bad opinion of some Stoics about pleasure, which is a preferred indifferent anyway and as such *per definitionem* not bad (as some seem to think). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I never said money leads to happiness.

[really](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/4ht86d/what_is_your_opinion_on_epicureanism/d2tjlmj)?

 I know it's a great paradox, but think about it for a second. Even if you're not actively pursuing happiness, you're still subconsciously doing so. Let's say you work at a tech company. You want to work harder to be promoted? Why? To be promoted. Why? Because..um...more money? **Money will lead to happiness.** Not the kind Epicurus described, but a kind nonetheless.

(The highlighting is mine.)

 The first part is of differing psychological viewpoints, not philosophy.

It isn't about different viewpoints. If someone says something and it turns out badly, just saying *"but we are doing it subconsciously"* is not sufficient for a rational response, especially if the original claim was about doing something actively. Even if the 'subconsciously' part were true indeed, that would still have to be shown. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the Greeks actually believed in rebirth though

In this general wording, this is not true. The ancient Greeks called the concept of rebirth/reincarnation *metempsychosis*, which was part of the Orphic religion and Pythagoreanism, for example. Some say that Plato believed in *metempsychosis*, which is disputed, but certainly the cause for overestimating the belief of the ancient Greeks in *metempsychosis*. There may be more religious movements sharing the belief in *metempsychosis*, but it wasn't that wide spread as some people claim.

According to the specialized literature about ancient Greece I have consulted for this reply to be on the safe side, the ancient Greeks of the archaic period basically believed in what we know as Hades (as far as it is possible to say something about their concept of afterlife at all). In later times there were several mystery religions (like the mentioned Orphic religion), but these had no single concept of afterlife in common. And there were Epicureans, Stoics and Skeptics who did not believe in any afterlife at all and certainly not in *metempsychosis*. </TEXT>

A lot of the responsible people do not only fail to *recognize a basic difference in ability between people* and therefore fail to offer children a sufficient range of educational environments and support according to their needs and abilities. They also seem to confuse the equality of people concerning their worth as human beings (this kind of equality is true) with the individual equality of their abilities (this kind of equality is certainly false). At the end, the individual abilities of children are levelled down to the lowest common denominator. </TEXT>

This is certainly not the case and by the way a really bad argumentation. Claiming that one's assertion which has turned out badly is true nevertheless because it is true subconsciously is an example of bad psychology.

I don't agree that money necessarily leads to happiness, either. Have you ever heard of the so-called hedonic treadmill? Typically, these people are never satisfied, since it is always possible to have even more money. Well, that should be clear to an Epicurean anyway, since Epicurus writes about that quite clearly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not the place to discuss Buddhism in detail, but I highly recommend articles like ["10 Misconceptions about Buddhism"](http://tricycle.org/magazine/10-misconceptions-about-buddhism/) by two of the most renowned scholars of Buddhism (unfortunately, this highly interesting article is not free any more - there is even one longer article for each of the ten points).

For example:

 Buddhism is nontheistic, it sees God as irrelevant.

Buddhism has been full of gods from the very beginning. Buddha himself is no god, not because god is too high, but because god is too low. Buddha is above all gods and *devatideva*, which is one of Buddha's many titles, literally means 'god above the gods'. Praying to Buddha is an essential part of Buddhist practice in virtually all traditions. The Christian scriptures are not clear about Jesus being god and therefore this was discussed for some centuries, but in Buddha's case this is part of the earliest Buddhist scriptures. Fortunately, this article is still free: [God or Human?](http://tricycle.org/trikedaily/god-or-human/)

There are some similarities compared with the Western imagination of Buddhism, which is quite young (basically, it was invented by Eugne Burnouf in the 19th century). Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with Buddism as it has been practiced by Asian Buddhists for nearly 2500 years and taught by Buddhist scholars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you ever investigated Buddhism? (That's only a rhetorical question.)

Buddhism and Epicureanism are nearly opposites of each other. In Buddhism the goal is becoming free from *samsara* and ending the circle of rebirths, in Epicureanism the goal is pleasure within *samsara*. In Buddhism that's not only not the goal, according to Buddhism everything is *dukkha* (suffering, anxiety, stress) and seeking pleasure strictly opposes its goal.

There also aren't just *some metaphysical discrepancies*, these discrepancies are tremendously huge. Buddhist cosmology with all it's realms from hell to the sphere of gods is completely different to Epicureanism. I cannot mention even one similarity and I have studied both world views quite a bit. </TEXT>

What exactly are the unacceptable philosophical consequences and how do you define 'pleasure'?

According to Epicurus, the highest pleasure is the absence of pain/distress and this is impossible without virtue. Epicureanism is about as far away from the common understanding of hedonism as Stoicism. I don't regard pleasure as the highest good, though.

 Gandhi: I like your Epicurus very much. Your Epicureans, not so much.

Epicurus is misunderstood quite often, especially his understanding of *hedone*. I am not even sure that people calling themselves Epicureans typically agree with Epicurus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't even think it is an exact Epictetus quote, at least it seems to be tremendously simplified. Well, I was not sure what you really meant, but you are right that the picture shows Epicurus. These images are not being created by people being familiar with philosophy. I suppose these people just take a template and put a wise sounding saying on it. Ignoring this kind of pictures is the best thing to do.

By the way, even Gregory Sadler uses the wrong picture in [this article](http://gbsadler.blogspot.co.at/2011/02/epictetus-on-anger-part-1-of-2.html).

As far as I know, there does not even exist a statue of Epictetus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It happens quite often that people mix up Epictetes and Epicurus. Unfortunately, you are one of them. This is a quotation of Epictetes who was a Stoic. It may not be a precise quotation, but the [Dichotomy of Control](http://www.traditionalstoicism.com/2016/04/19/dichotomy-of-control/) is one of the most famous Stoic principles of Epictetes, who was one of the most famous Stoics. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  For instance, I see someone else who sees the goal of Stoicism as attaining tranquility.

According to my understanding, *tranquility* is a common translation of *ataraxia* and highly valuable. It's more a consequence of pursuing virtue than an end to be pursued, though.

 But isn't the goal, as in the thought that the Stoic strives to pursue, actually eudaemonia?

Basically, no translation of *eudaimonia* satisfies the whole range of its meanings and therefore *eudaimonia* is often left untranslated, but it is also an emotional state. You are certainly right that *eudaimonia* is the goal.

 To me seeking out an internal emotional state is a kind of hedonism.

I think that equating seeking out an emotional state with hedonism is wrong. While seeking out specific emotional states may be part of hedonism indeed, it is essential which emotional states are to be seeked out and seeking out emotional states is far from sufficient for hedonism anyway.

 But the same page also sees kindness and equality as subvirtues of justice, which doesn't make sense to me.

Why not? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The outcome of an exam is an external and is not under our control.

It is *not completely* under our control, because there are things influencing the result which we certainly cannot control. But how good we prepare ourselves for exams is under our control. A better preparation usually leads to better results (although not necessarily).

 the result of the exam is based on chance [...]

That's a typical lame excuse of lazy students. There is no doubt that also chance influences the result of an exam, but that does not mean that it is exclusively based on chance. The dichotomy of control is not meant as excuse for being lazy.

 [...] whether we got good sleep the night before, whether we chose to study the things which end up being on the exam, whether our brains are able to recall the correct information correctly, etc.

Although there is some chance involved, it's not completely so. We can go to bed early enough and drink less coffee or do some sports the day before the exam, we can inform ourselves about the kind of things which have been asked in the past, recalling the learned information can be trained...

By the way, the best possible preparation and indifference towards the results of exams together can have very positive effects on all points you attribute to chance and usually contribute to better results, too.

 Those things which are up to us are fully under our control (our thoughts, choices, etc.) Everything else is not up to us, not within our control, and subject to hindrance from outside forces.

Things not being fully under our control aren't necessarily completely outside our control. There is not just black and white, there are also many shades of grey. Things being fully under our control is the exception. </TEXT>

[**What Predicts Childrens Fixed and Growth Intelligence Mind-Sets? Not Their Parents Views of Intelligence but Their Parents Views of Failure**](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/04/23/0956797616639727)

by Kyla Haimovitz and Carol S. Dweck, Department of Psychology, Stanford University

 **Abstract**

 Childrens *intelligence mind-sets* (i.e., their beliefs about whether intelligence is fixed or malleable) robustly influence their motivation and learning. Yet, surprisingly, research has not linked parents intelligence mind-sets to their childrens. We tested the hypothesis that a different belief of parentstheir *failure mind-sets*may be more visible to children and therefore more prominent in shaping their beliefs. In Study 1, we found that parents can view failure as debilitating or enhancing, and that these failure mind-sets predict parenting practices and, in turn, childrens intelligence mind-sets. Study 2 probed more deeply into how parents display failure mind-sets. In Study 3a, we found that children can indeed accurately perceive their parents failure mind-sets but not their parents intelligence mind-sets. Study 3b showed that childrens perceptions of their parents failure mind-sets also predicted their own intelligence mind-sets. Finally, Study 4 showed a causal effect of parents failure mind-sets on their responses to their childrens hypothetical failure. Overall, parents who see failure as debilitating focus on their childrens performance and ability rather than on their childrens learning, and their children, in turn, tend to believe that intelligence is fixed rather than malleable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But part of Stoicism is not worrying, fearing, avoiding the difficult.

I agree to your comment, but want to mention that Stoics do have feelings like fear or worry, Stoics are no statues after all, but we differ in how we deal with them. For example, we transform *fear* into *caution* and *pleasure* into *joy* to name two examples.

 While you worry about being too young, I'm sure there are 30,40,50,60,70,80, 90, 100 year olds worrying about being too old.

Some days ago I cited Marcus Aurelius at /r/Epicureanism, so let me cite Epicurus here (from the [Letter to Menoeceus](http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html)):

 Let no one be slow to seek wisdom when he is young nor weary in the search of it when he has grown old. For no age is too early or too late for the health of the soul. And to say that the season for studying philosophy has not yet come, or that it is past and gone, is like saying that the season for happiness is not yet or that it is now no more. Therefore, both old and young alike ought to seek wisdom, the former in order that, as age comes over him, he may be young in good things because of the grace of what has been, and the latter in order that, while he is young, he may at the same time be old, because he has no fear of the things which are to come. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Health is an example of what Stoics call a preferred indifferent and Stoics certainly prefer being treated by a physician, if necessary, as long as there is no strong reason against it. Also don't forget that Marcus Aurelius' personal physician was the most famous physician of ancient Rome, Galen, whom Marcus Aurelius sent out at the outbreak of the so-called [Antonine Plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonine_Plague). I am quite sure that Marcus Aurelius doesn't want to say that diseases should not be treated, although the text is not unambiguous in this respect.

I think that Marcus Aurelius basically wants to say that we should not allow sickness to prevent us from doing what we are supposed to do. In other words, sickness should not hinder us from staying true to our philosophy. The higher goods of Stoicism and Epicureism differ from each other, but Stoicism and Epicureism agree about the importance of living philosophically even under difficult circumstances. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Epictetus was still a slave, [his master broke his leg](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epictetu/):

 There is a story told by the author Celsus (probably a younger contemporary of Epictetus)  quoted by the early Christian Origen (c.185254) at Contra Celsum 7.53  that when still a slave, Epictetus was tortured by his master who twisted his leg. Enduring the pain with complete composure, Epictetus warned Epaphroditus that his leg would break, and when it did break, he said, 'There, did I not tell you that it would break?' And from that time Epictetus was lame.

And I agree with /u/EsquilaxHortensis that this comic is unfair. The Discourses, the lecture notes written by one of his student, give a completely different picture of his lectures. I'd enjoy attending Epictetus' lectures. </TEXT>

I appreciate and agree to your excellent comment, but I think that calling Steiner a philosopher gives him way too much respect. He wrote a dissertation about Fichte's concept of the ego, for which he received a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Rostock, but did not contribute anything significant to philosophy otherwise. His dissertation, of which I read about a third, is something like a philosophical basis for his esoteric construct, the anthroposophy, and I doubt that it is ineresting in any other respect than for a better understanding of anthroposophy. </TEXT>

 Despite international advancements in gender equality across a variety of societal domains, the underrepresentation of girls and women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) related fields persists. In this study, we explored the possibility that the sex difference in mathematics anxiety contributes to this disparity. More specifically, we tested a number of predictions from the prominent gender stratification model, which is the leading psychological theory of cross-national patterns of sex differences in mathematics anxiety and performance. To this end, we analyzed data from 761,655 15-year old students across 68 nations who participated in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Most importantly and contra predictions, we showed that economically developed and more gender equal countries have a lower overall level of mathematics anxiety, and yet a larger national sex difference in mathematics anxiety relative to less developed countries. Further, although relatively more mothers work in STEM fields in more developed countries, these parents valued, on average, mathematical competence more in their sons than their daughters. The proportion of mothers working in STEM was unrelated to sex differences in mathematics anxiety or performance. We propose that the gender stratification model fails to account for these national patterns and that an alternative model is needed. In the discussion, we suggest how an interaction between socio-cultural values and sex-specific psychological traits can better explain these patterns. We also discuss implications for policies aiming to increase girls STEM participation.

[**The relationship between transformational leadership and follower sickness absence: the role of presenteeism**](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02678373.2016.1170736)

by Karina Nielsen, Kevin Daniels

 **Abstract**

 The impact of transformational leaders on employee health and well-being has received much attention. Less research has focused on the relationships between transformational leaders and followers sickness absenteeism. Transformational leaders promote a group climate that may lead to absenteeism, especially among vulnerable employees (those with high levels of presenteeism). In the present study we examined the relationships between presenteeism, group-level transformational leadership and sickness absence rates in a three-year longitudinal study of postal workers and their leaders in Denmark (N=155). Group-level transformational leadership in year 1 predicted sickness absenteeism in year 2, but not in year 3. In examining conditions under which transformational leadership may be linked to higher levels of sickness absenteeism, we found that presenteeism in year 1 moderated the link between transformational leadership in year 1 and sickness absenteeism in year 3, such that followers working in groups with a transformational leader and who were high in presenteeism reported higher levels of sickness absenteeism.

[**Wrong place to get help: A field experiment on luxury stores and helping behavior**](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510.2016.1160839)

by Lubomir Lamy, Nicolas Guguen, Jacques Fischer-Lokou   Jrme Guegan

 **Abstract**

 Three experiments were conducted in field settings. It was hypothesized that luxury stores may act as environmental reminders of materialism and that helpfulness would vary according to the presence or absence of such cues. Study 1 (N = 80) indicated that consumers coming out of famous brand stores displayed less helpfulness, as compared to mere passersby. Study 2 (N = 112) showed passersby were less helpful near a luxury brand store than in an ordinary street with no shops. In Study 3 (N = 360), passersby were less helpful when walking down a street lined with highly exclusive stores, as compared to streets with ordinary stores or no stores. Results, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There were certain agreements, but Stoics and Epicureans still saw themselves as opposing schools and certainly not without good reasons. At least the later Stoics Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius discussed Epicureanism quite soberly, though. Marcus Aurelius even [established four Chairs of Philosophy in Athens, one for each of the principal philosophical traditions (Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, and Epicurean)](http://www.iep.utm.edu/marcus/). That is, one of the best known and certainly mightiest Stoics helped the Epicureans.

I want to finish my comment with a quote from Marcus Aurelius ([Meditations, Book IX](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.9.nine.html)):

 Epicurus says, In my sickness my conversation was not about my bodily sufferings, nor, says he, did I talk on such subjects to those who visited me; but I continued to discourse on the nature of things as before, keeping to this main point, how the mind, while participating in such movements as go on in the poor flesh, shall be free from perturbations and maintain its proper good. Nor did I, he says, give the physicians an opportunity of putting on solemn looks, as if they were doing something great, but my life went on well and happily. Do, then, the same that he did both in sickness, if thou art sick, and in any other circumstances; for never to desert philosophy in any events that may befall us, nor to hold trifling talk either with an ignorant man or with one unacquainted with nature, is a principle of all schools of philosophy; but to be intent only on that which thou art now doing and on the instrument by which thou doest it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who is born and lives in a country where a huge part of classical music is from, I may have experienced that to a much lesser degree than people somewhere else. But this might not even be the case, if I were born about twenty years later. Today many people living in the country where Mozart is from don't know more composers than Mozart, Beethoven and Johann Strau, according to a recent poll.

That being said, as a listener to classical music I have always belonged to a very small minority and I have also been looked at funny for hearing classical music *exclusively*. Today I prefer to say that I *primarily* listen to classical music (which is not completely false anyway). </TEXT>

[B. Alan Wallace - A Buddhist View of Free Will. Beyond Determinism and Indeterminism](http://www.alanwallace.org/buddhistviewoffreewill.pdf)

 **Abstract:** While the question of free will does not figure as prominently in Buddhist writings as it does in western theology, philosophy, and psychology, it is a topic that was addressed in the earliest Buddhist writings. According to these accounts, for pragmatic and ethical reasons, the Buddha rejected both determinism and indeterminism as understood at that time. Rather than asking the metaphysical question of whether already humans have free will, Buddhist tradition takes a more pragmatic approach, exploring ways in which we can acquire greater freedom to make wise choices that are truly conducive to our own and others genuine well-being. One key to achieving such freedom is the cultivation of attentional skills so that one can deliberately focus ones attention with continuity and clarity on ones chosen object. A second theme is the cultivation of insight into the manner in which our own attitudes shape experience, allowing for the possibility of altering not only the way we experience events in the present, but also how we are influenced by our memories of the past. Finally, the Great Perfection school of Tibetan Buddhism emphasizes the realization of the deepest dimension of consciousness  pristine awareness  which transcends the nexus of causality. This is regarded as the ultimate source of freedom and the ultimate nature of human identity.

The [**Journal of Buddhist Ethics**](http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/) has published a four-article series about Buddhism and free will:

 Humans strive for some kind of happiness in a world that is not conducive to it. As each human life is a collection of random thoughts, choices, experiences, memories, and their interpretations, a permanent state of vague happiness does not exist, since everything is temporary. The pursuit of happiness, or the pursuit of anything in life, does not lead to a permanent state or thing. One can only experience moments of contentment in life. Some measure of temporary sense of perceived happiness is achieved not by pursuing it but by recognizing meaningful moments that could be missed during the pursuit itself.  </TEXT>

 Article compares some aspects of current interdisciplinary discourse critical of religion with Lucretius poem De rerum natura. In the first part, I try to show how a brief review of modern scientific literature can assist to resolve one of the much discussed problems in Lucretian scholarship, namely the attitude of Lucretius towards traditional Graeco-Roman religion and the question of (in)coherence of his thought. In the second part, I change the perspective in order to show that, in some key aspects, Lucretius can be viewed as the precursor of contemporary critique of religion. </TEXT>

The concept of translation-as-Enlightenment in relation to the affective multitude of existence is explained in relation to ideas about causality, compassion, translation, aesthetics, epistemology and politics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Stoic position is quite complicated and much discussed, since they also believe in free will. This is quite surprising, since Stoic cosmology is not only deterministic, but also cyclic and each cycle is completely identical to all other cycles:

 The world-process is circular. God changes the fiery substance of himself first into air, then water, then earth. So the world arises. But it will be ended by a conflagration in which all things will return into the primal fire. Thereafter, at a pre-ordained time, God will again transmute himself into a world. It follows from the law of necessity that the course taken by this second, and every subsequent, world, will be identical in every way with the course taken by the first world. The process goes on for ever, and nothing new ever happens. The history of each successive world is the same as that of all the others down to the minutest details. ([IEP](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/#H3))

How can free will be compatible with a cosmology like that? </TEXT>

Izhaarbir Singh has written a [short comment about Epictetus](http://izhaarbir.com/phil/university-of-houston-undergraduate-%E2%80%93-senior/epictetus-reaction/), which he refers to in the article. Stoicism is being misunderstood quite often, in particular the Stoic's understanding of emotions, which on the other hand is quite a complex subject. I also think that Epictetus' handbook is easier to understand after reading Epictetus' lectures.

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/23387065/Madhyamaka_Ethics)

 There are two main loci of contemporary debate about the nature of Madhyamaka ethics. The first investigates the general issue of whether the Madhyamaka philosophy of emptiness (*nyavda*) is consistent with a commitment to systematic ethical distinctions. The second queries whether the metaphysical analysis of no-self presented by ntideva in his *Bodhicaryvatra* entails the impartial benevolence of a bodhisattva. This article will critically examine these debates and demonstrate the ways in which they are shaped by competing understandings of Madhyamaka conventional truth or reality (*savtisatya*) and the forms of reasoning admissible for differentiating conventional truth from falsity and good from bad. </TEXT>

I have read a good biography and therefore I knew it mostly, but I had to use Google to get the name with all titles right and I was not sure about his exact birth name.

 He was adopted as an adult?!

Hadrian adopted Lucius Aelius Caesar who should have been Hadrian's successor. Lucius Aelius Caesar, however, died before Hadrian. Then Hadrian made Antoninus Pius his successor, but Antoninus had to adopt Lucius Aelius' son Lucius Verus and Marcus.  That is, Hadrian wanted him to adopt Lucius Verus, while the adoption of Marcus may have been Antoninus' suggestion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are not useless without accepting Stoic theology and metaphysics, they actually work very well (and with some adaptions for Epicureans as well). But it affects the theoretical foundation of Stoic ethics. If Stoicism is to be more than (efficient) self-help or a way of life, it will have to be founded differently. The question is, how far one can go without leaving Stoicism.

When I wrote

 I see much value in Stoic ethics and the therapeutic framework. We shall not forget that the most effective psychotherapy is based on Stoicism and it is also the most scientifically validated one.

I referred to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). If you are interested in the effectiveness of Stoic teachings, you may have a look at *The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Stoic Philosophy as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy* by Donald Robertson, which I liked very much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Happiness**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p005489g)

 Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss whether 'happiness' means living a life of pleasure, or of virtue. It is an old question, and the Roman poet Horace attempted to answer it when he wrote; 'Not the owner of many possessions will you be right to call happy: he more rightly deserves the name of happy who knows how to use the gods's gifts wisely and to put up with rough poverty, and who fears dishonour more than death'. It seems a noble sentiment but for the Greek Sophist Thrasymachus this sort of attitude was the epitome of moral weakness: For him poverty was miserable, and happiness flowed from wealth and power over men, an idea so persuasive that Plato wrote The Republic in response to its challenge. What have our philosophers made of the compulsion to be happy? And how much does this ancient debate still define what it means to be happy today? Are we entitled to health, wealth and the pursuit of pleasure or is true contentment something else entirely?

 With Angie Hobbs, Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Warwick; Simon Blackburn, Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge University; Anthony Grayling, Reader in Philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a lot of misconceptions indeed and I am quite certain to share some of them, too.

Stoics believe that *logos* is immanent in everything, *logos* is one of two first principles and identified with god by the Stoics, thus they essentially believe in the god of Spinoza. According to the Stoics, human have an extraordinarily big part of *logos*. Because this god is perfect, we are exactly where we are supposed to be, no matter how miserable our living environment is. We are to fulfill the role which we are intended for by perfecting our own essential nature: As rational and social beings we shall therefore excel in wisdom, justice, courage and self-discipline. That is, being a good person is necessary and sufficient for happiness.

Stoicism offers a therapeutic framework (this is also true for Ancient Stoicism). We cannot control external things, for example that we are living in a miserable living environment, but we can always control ourselves, our opinions, our value judgements, everything we need to be virtuous, which is the one and only good. Therefore, we can be completely free and happy even under the worst circumstances. The Stoic sage is happy even while being tortured the worst possible way.

I am no Stoic. I don't believe in divine providence and Stoic theology and metaphysics. And I don't think that virtue is the sole good. As an Epicurean I agree that being virtuous is necessary for being happy, but disagree that it is also sufficient. However, I see much value in Stoic ethics and the therapeutic framework. We shall not forget that the most effective psychotherapy is based on Stoicism and it is also the most scientifically validated one. I am also very fine with Stoic cosmopolitanism. Stoicism was one of the most important philosophies for 500 years and there were some excellent Stoic philosophers. One of the two most important Ancient logicians was a Stoic. I think that studying Stoicism is rewarding even for Epicureans.

That being said, I think that many people of /r/Stoicism don't believe in Stoic theology and metaphysics, either. Divine providence is nothing we read much about there. I consider this as a very important part of Stoicism, since everything else follows from that in some way. Most people are interested in Stoic ethics and techniques, which are efficient indeed. </TEXT>

Your words appear sarcastic, because they are a very bad caricature of Stoics concerning pleasure (and maybe not even that). The most hardcore Stoics treated pleasure more differentiated than that. Read, for example, the excellent FAQ of /r/Stoicism, especially the section: [Is enjoyment of life's pleasures a goal advocated in Stoicism?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_is_enjoyment_of_life.27s_pleasures_a_goal_advocated_in_stoicism.3F) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And all forms of criticism or opinion others have of me, I do not let it get to me.

Stoics are expected to be self-critical and to reflect on oneselves daily. We have a whole book by a Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, which consists to a major part of self-reflection. Not listening to other people's opinions and criticisms at all is really bad advice, because constructive feedback of other people is a very valuable source for critical self-reflection and self-improvement. You are certainly not supposed to automatically accept all criticisms, but rational people at least reflect on them before accepting or rejecting them.

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/mirabilia/mirabilia_a2014m1-6n18/mirabilia_a2014m1-6n18p6.pdf)

 Epicureanism was seen by its opponents, both pagan and Christian, as the philosophy of pleasure and atheism. From the theological point of view, the accusation of atheism was incorrect, since Epicurus and the Epicureans admitted of the existence of deities, and posited them as models of moral perfection, while denying their interest in human affairs, i.e. providence. This denial aimed at guaranteeing their imperturbability (*ataraxia*). From the ethical point of view, the ideal of pleasure (*hdon*), on which I shall concentrate here, was grossly misunderstood or distorted by the opponents of Epicureanism, who generally did not take into consideration the moderation, equilibrium, and serenity that the superior catastematic pleasure (Epicuruss real ideal of pleasure) involved. I shall analyse the attitude of late-antique sources, especially Christian, toward Epicureanism and its ethics. A great many of Useners and Arrighettis fragments of Epicurus indeed come from Christian late-antique authors, such as Clement, Origen, Eusebius, Lactantius, and Augustine, but other patristic authors should be added, such as Basil and Gregory of Nyssa. Even if patristic interest in Epicureanism is often critical, and sometimes imprecise or distorted, nevertheless it is tangible. I shall focus on the authors who make the most interesting use of Epicurean sources, particularly with respect to the ethical doctrine: Origen, Dionysius of Alexandria, Lactantius, Ambrose, Jerome and Augustine, Gregory Nyssen, and Nazianzen, the only one who really understood and praised Epicuruss notion of *hdon*. I shall also argue that the fading away of the availability and use of good sources on Epicureanism, along with the disappearance of the Epicurean school itself, brought about an impoverishment in the understanding of, and hostility to, Epicurus and Epicureanism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Getting rid of emotions is nothing a Stoic is aiming for indeed, Stoics are no statues after all. I think you are quite right, although the word *meditation* may be a little bit misleading for people identifying *meditation* with the Buddhist meditation.

You may be interested in a passage of the book *Reforming the Art of Living* by Rico Vitz, which I found when I searched for *eupathe* with Google. You can read it [here](https://books.google.at/books?id=LrbkBAAAQBAJ pg=PA43#v=onepage q f=false). This is very closely related to your question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your quote is actually about providence, which was a very basic part of ancient Stoicism indeed. I am not saying you should believe in providence, but the question what one can take from a philosophy without arriving at a different philosophy is a rather common problem.

That being said, I don't believe in gods, either. However, after centuries of Christianity the word "god" has a different meaning to us than to ancient Stoics. The Stoic god is a pantheistic god and therefore not even similar to a deity like the Christian god. The Stoics identified god with *logos* which is one of the two first principles pervading the Universe. </TEXT>

It is obvious that Donald Trump is financially successful, which is exactly what many (if not most) people understand under being successful. However, since we are in a Stoic discussion forum, it's reasonable to look at somebody's success from a Stoic point of view.

Being successful in something indifferent is not virtuous, it is indifferent. He can be virtuous in what he does with his financial success, though. Unfortunately, I don't see his statements of the last months as particularly virtuous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I am concerned, I appreciate your ideas very much. A dictionary like that can help a lot indeed, but more for being able to refer to it than for maintaining the illusion that people would read it before asking their questions. I have no doubt that people will continue asking the same questions based on the same misconceptions again and again. We already have an excellent FAQ. If you read the FAQ and the other wiki pages, you will know a lot about Stoicism.

I also think that using the original terms can be helpful indeed, although I'd prefer to add them in parenthesis following the English words (eventually with links to the dictionary), if that makes sense within the given context. This would make it clear that Stoics often don't use common words in their common sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**

 Epicurus is one of the first social contract theorists, holding that justice is an agreement neither to harm nor be harmed. He also says that living justly is necessary and sufficient for living pleasantly, which is the Epicurean goal. Some say that there are two accounts of justice in Epicurusone as a personal virtue, the other as a virtue of institutions. I argue that the personal virtue derives from compliance with just social institutions, and so we need to attribute only one account of justice to Epicurus. I show how this interpretation makes sense of claims about justice by Epicurus and his followers, including Hermarchus, Lucretius, and Diogenes of Oinoanda. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**

 Epicurus argued that death is no misfortune, because when a person dies, he no longer has sensation, and sensation is a necessary condition of value for a person. This argument, however, faces a powerful objection. Contemporary philosophers argue that death is bad precisely because it deprives one of good experiences one would have had, had one not died. I analyze and evaluate the Epicurean response to this objection, showing how, according to Epicurus, this objection reflects mistaken and unhealthy ideas about how lives should be evaluated. Uncovering and addressing these modes of evaluation constitutes a central aim of Epicurean therapy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It's so easy to get into theory-crafting philosophy and not get around to putting it into practice.

Being a philosophy, theory is certainly an essential part of Stoicism and therefore it shouldn't be neglected. However, it's totally wrong to stop there indeed. </TEXT>

 **POINT:** Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable menI can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together.

 **COUNTERPOINT:** Honestly, fuck you.

I think, Marcus Aurelius is perfectly right here and this "rebuttal" just proves his point (I'd add "stupid" to the list). </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](http://www.faculty.umb.edu/adam_beresford/courses/phil_381_08/1_lucretius_death.pdf)

 This paper identifies two possible versions of the Epicurean 'Symmetry argument', both of which claim that *post mortem* non-existence is relevantly like prenatal non-existence and that therefore our attitude to the former should be the same as that towards the latter. One version addresses the fear of the state of being dead by making it equivalent to the state of not yet being born; the other addresses the prospective fear of dying by relating it to our present retrospective attitude to the time before birth. I argue that only the first of these is present in the relevant sections of Lucretius (DRN 3.832-42, 972-5). Therefore, this argument is not aimed at a prospective fear of death, or a fear of 'mortality'. That particular fear is instead addressed by the Epicureans through the additional premise (found in the *Letter to Menoeceus* 125) that it is irrational to fear in prospect an event which is known to be painless when present. This still leaves unaddressed the related fear of 'premature death', which is to be removed through the acceptance of Epicurean hedonism. </TEXT>

 This paper reconstructs Gilles Deleuzes interpretation of Epicurean atomism, and explicates his claim that it represents a problematic idea, similar to the idea exemplified in early, barbaric accounts of the differential calculus. Deleuzian problematic ideas are characterized by a mechanism through whose activity the components of the idea become determinate in relating reciprocally to one another, rather than in being determined exclusively in relation to an extrinsic paradigm or framework. In Epicurean atomism, as Deleuze reads it, such a mechanism of determination can be found in the famous atomic swerve. It is necessary to bear this interpretation of Epicurean atomism in mind when understanding Deleuze and Guattaris promulgation of a new image of thought in *What is Philosophy?*, which has an explicitly Epicurean inspiration. The paper argues that this inspiration is particularly evident to the extent that Deleuze and Guattari identify the sub-representative feature that lies at the heart of their new image of thought with chaos, defined as infinite speed. I claim that infinite speed, this otherwise puzzling feature of *What is Philosophy?*, ought to be understood in the light of Deleuzes interpretation of Epicurus. Moreover, the Epicurean distinctions between different speeds must be read together with Deleuzes appropriation of the metaphysics of the ancient Stoics, who, although widely recognized as Deleuzes Hellenistic counterparts, lack important theoretical resources that the Epicureans provide for Deleuze. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/9994555/Is_Epicurean_Friendship_Altruistic)

 Epicurus is strongly committed to psychological and ethical egoism and hedonism. However, these commitments do not square easily with many of the claims made by Epicureans about friendship: for instance, that the wise man will sometimes die for his friend, that the wise man will love his friend as much as himself, feel exactly the same toward his friend as toward himself, and exert himself as much for his friend's pleasure as for his own, and that every friendship is worth choosing for its own sake. These claims have led some scholars to assert that Epicurus inconsistently affirms that friendship has an altruistic element. I argue that the Epicurean claims about friendship can be reconciled with egoism and hedonism in psychology and ethics. Friendship is valuable because having friends provides one with security more effectively than any other means, and having confidence that one will be secure in the future either is identical to ataraxia, or the grounds on which one has it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276152459_The_Benefits_of_Behaving_Badly_on_Occasion_Successful_Regulation_by_Planned_Hedonic_Deviations)

 This research tests the idea that goal-pursuit that requires extended inhibition of desires, such as weight loss and financial saving, can benefit from including planned hedonic deviations in the goal-striving plan. Two controlled experiments (simulated and real dieting) demonstrate that including planned goal deviations during extended goal striving, compared with following a straight and rigid goal striving process, (1) helps regain self-regulatory resources, (2) helps maintain consumers' motivation to pursue with regulatory tasks, and (3) has a positive impact on affect experienced, which all contribute to facilitate long-term goal-adherence. A third study, conducted with current goal-strivers provides further evidence of the benefits of planned hedonic deviations for goal pursuit across a variety of goals. This reveals that it may be beneficial for long-term goal-success to occasionally be bad, as long it is planned. </TEXT>

 Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism are three main classic Chinese philosophy schools, which all deal with the question of how one should live. In this paper, we first review these ancient recommendations and next consider whether they promise a happy life in present-day society. Recommended behaviours found in the ancient texts are compared with conditions for happiness as observed in present-day empirical investigations. Classic Confucianism appears to offer the most apt advice for finding happiness in present-day society, in particular because it recommends that one should be involved in real life. Classic Taoist advice is second best: its strong point is that it advises us against too much social conformism and bookishness. The advice given by classic Buddhists is better not followed in modern society. </TEXT>

 Epicurus was a philosopher who lived in Greece in the 3rd century B.C. Like his contemporaries, he was much concerned with the question of how to live a good life. In his view the Chief Good is to decrease pain and increase pleasure. Though Epicurus is reputed for advocating the pursuit of refined sensorial pleasures, he recognized the need for deferring gratification or enduring pain. He advised his followers to lead a modest and contemplative life in friendly communities. His advice can be characterized as serene hedonism. This paper explains that position and considers its applicability for the present day. It concludes that Epicureanism was quite accurate in describing the conditions of happiness and that he offered valuable guidelines in dealing with hardship and difficult emotional content. His ideas that happiness is the same as the absence of pain and that one should withdraw from society are less fortunate. It made him assume that happiness automatically follows if one is in the right state of mind, and that there is no need to actively seek interaction with the environment for the betterment of the circumstances of life. However, Epicurus advice might have been a good option for his contemporaries given the societal turmoil in his times. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Lots of high quality subreddits do similar things, e.g., /r/askhistorians.

Are we talking about personal messages or public replies? /r/AskHistorians does not do the latter which I assumed to be what /u/sleeps_with_crazy suggested and that's what I'd consider annoying. I am ok with personal messages.

However, I don't think personal messages are the reason for the quality of /r/AskHistorians anyway. The moderation of that sub does an excellent job and I don't see any other way than that to ensure quality. Thus, we have arrived at:

 you can't force absent moderators to moderate.

There may be people who like being active moderators instead or in addition to inactive members of the current team.

 Accounts should have to be at least a few months old with activity elsewhere on the site.

I think this is way too long. I'd suggest two weeks to be allowed to post replies and a reasonable number of comments and a certain amount of comment karma in this sub to be allowed to post submissions. And one should need a verified email. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Things not belonging to this sub will continue to be posted here with and without that automatic reply by the AutoMod. The really big change is that people posting good content would be annoyed by the AutoMod, too.

A better solution may be a more active moderation which deletes such submissions with a comment similar to the text of the sidebar:

 Homework problems, practice problems, and similar questions should be directed to /r/learnmath, /r/homeworkhelp or /r/cheatatmathhomework. Do not **ask or answer** this type of question in /r/math.

And it may be helpful to simply not answer these kind of questions more consequently than it is the case now.

A sub can be configured such that submissions from brand new accounts are impossible. This may be helpful, too. </TEXT>

 Jerry Z. Muller argues that the recent economic malaise, our first epistemologically-driven depression, is due to the unconscious incompetence of those entrusted with the global economy. Recognizing that conceptual errors (viparyasa/viparyaya) prevent clear insight into the working of reality, Buddhist philosophers emphasize the importance of epistemology as a means of transformation by overturning (paravrtti) our cognitive confusion. Accordingly Buddhist philosophy has developed tools to deconstruct our dysfunctional economic delusions and expose the dysfunctional assumptions that have spawned them. This essay examines 1) philosophical flaws in the reigning economic models; 2) the psychology of economics, now penetrating the digital world with its virtual economic reality; and 3) a Buddhist epistemology (anitya, shunyata/pratityasamutpada, an-atman) that resonates with paradigm changes in post-modern science, including functional counter-models from micro-lending to Bhutans GNH (Gross National Happiness) index and the movement of Engaged Buddhism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Summary by the author**

 The cornerstone of Epicurus physics is atomism: Epicurus follows Democritus in maintaining that our world is ultimately composed of atoms and the void. It is, then, somewhat surprising that the demonstration of the atomist thesis is apparently conned to three sentences in the *Letter to Herodotus*, our main source on Epicurus physics. These are the three sentences that I shall focus on in this paper. First, I shall argue that the standard interpretation, which takes the argument to be based on the impossibility of sizeless parts, is not the correct one. Then, I shall examine the alternative reconstruction of the atomist argument that focuses on the body void distinction. Finally, I shall try to show that Epicurus defence of atomism is based on the unalterability of the atoms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**

 Epicurus (341-270 BC) was, with Plato and Aristotle, one of the three great philosophers of the ancient world. He developed an integrated system of ethics and natural philosophy that, he claimed and many accepted, showed everyone the way to a life of the greatest happiness. The school that he founded remained open for 798 years after his death. While it lost place during the last 200 of these years, his philosophy held until then a wide and often decisive hold on the ancient mind.

 The revival of Epicureanism in the 17^th century coincided with the growth of scientific rationalism and classical liberalism. There can be no doubt these facts are connected. It may, indeed, be argued that the first was a leading cause of the second two, and that we are now living in a world shaped, in every worthwhile sense, by the ideas of Epicurus. </TEXT>

 Hafiz and Horace are both among the greatest poets of the world. Despite the differences and dissimilarities in their motifs, concepts, and notion infrastructures, they are somehow similar in their Epicurean notions. Both agree about notions on carpe diem, death acceptance, greed absence, drinking, and being happy leading the readers to perceptiveness and new horizons. It is attempted here to study the Epicurean notions of Hafiz as the presenter of Iranian thinking, and Horace as a versifier of ancient Rome. The following question will be answered in this study: What are the Epicurean notions? Which basic notions of Hafiz and Horace are common in Epicurean domain? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I don't think the term Meaningful has any meaning at all.

I see what you mean and I mostly agree. But let's look at it in a different way: we cannot control all circumstances, but we can control ourselves to a degree, that is, the way we react to and deal with the circumstances. We are quite a bit into Stoicism here, but even as an Epicurean I think that there are Stoic teachings and techniques which can be quite helpful indeed.

Victor Frankl's book *Man's Search for Meaning* is certainly a book everybody should read at least once, but one certainly should not forget that suffering in a concentration camp was a tremendously extreme situation which different people deal with completely differently. I feel that using the word *meaning* in the context of concentration camps is rather obscene, too. However, in this case it is a survivor using it. Other survivors differ in what they have written about their suffering, many survivors feel ashamed or even guilty. These are personal stories of survivors and we who have never been in extreme situations like that (and hopefully never will) shall take them as such respectfully. [edit: But I think we shouldn't overinterpret them.] </TEXT>

 This essay looks at Nietzsche in relation to the Epicurean tradition. It focuses on his middle period writings of 1878-82  texts such as *Human, all too Human, Dawn*, and *The Gay Science*  and seeks to show that an ethos of Epicurean enlightenment pervades these texts, with Epicurus celebrated for his teaching of modest pleasures and cultivation of philosophical serenity. For Nietzsche, Epicurus is one of the greatest human beings to have ever graced the earth and the inventor of heroic-idyllic philosophizing. At the same time, Nietzsche claims to understand Epicurus differently to everybody else. The essay explores the main figurations of Epicurus we find in his middle period and concludes by taking a critical look at his later and more ambivalent reception of Epicurus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my humble opinion, Epicurus' [Letter to Menoeceus](http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html) is one of the best summaries of Epicureanism and it isn't very long.

Buddhism teaches that we should learn to have a state of mind in which we are not being driven to and fro by our desires. This state of mind (or at least a similar one) is being aimed at in Epicureanism, too. We call that state of mind *ataraxia* or imperturbability which is the essence of Epicurean happiness. It is the state in which we are free of pain and anxiety and unnecessary desires (Epicurus distinguishes between necessary and unnecessary desires). According to Epicurus, reaching *ataraxia* is the goal of philosophy in the same way as health is the goal of medicine. In order to reach it we need prudence and modesty and resistance to any superstitions like aspirations of immortality.

 Epicurus (341-270 B.C.) is an ancient Greek philosopher, who holds that we should prudently take into account of all the consequences of an action in order to secure the greatest possible amount of pleasure in the whole course of life. Since such an important age-old thought of Epicurus is not visible enough in contemporary discussions of normative ethics, we here like to shed some light on his ethical thought in the hope to rescue him from oblivion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Summary**

The author of this paper describes different kinds of hedonism, Aristippus and Epicurus being the most prominent examples. He further explains Crvka ethics which may be called hedonism in Indian philosophy. Siddhartha Sadhu concludes his paper comparing Crvka ethics with the hedonistic systems of Aristippus and Epicurus.

Interesting: Siddhartha Sadhu calls Vtsyana, the author of the Kma-Sutra, a culture Crvka who, in the second chapter of the Kma-Sutra, is rather close to Epicurus in a way. Both advocate a refined hedonism. According to the author, the traditional Crvka view hardly resembles Epicurus' hedonism though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Epicureans use a very idiosyncratic definition of *hedone* indeed which has lead to major misunderstandings from the beginning of Epicureanism. According to Epicureism *hedone* is the highest good and therefore I completely agree that Epicureanism is hedonism. But I also understand that people who don't know much more about Epicureanism than the mainstream may have completely wrong ideas about Epicureanism, if it is called hedonism, since the absence of pain is certainly not the common definition of hedonism. </TEXT>

People certainly take different approaches to their religion, some prefer a more rational approach and others a more emotional one. If a certain approach helps improving his relationship with his mother and staying true to himself, he may consider choosing it. I think that [your comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/3w08kw/my_cousin_13_is_being_discriminated_by_his_own/cxsu573) is helpful and points to the right direction, although I don't fully agree with the part about Buddhism being a philosophy. Concentrating on Buddhist ethics and showing reference for the historical Siddhartha Gautama may help not to be confrontational without being self-denying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/19310135/Early_Buddhist_Teaching_as_Proto-sunyavada)

 This article argues that the search for a metaphysical foundation to early Buddhist thought is futile. For if the world of experience is a cognitive construction, as implied in a number of early discourses, it follows that thought cannot transcend its limits, and cannot attain an objective picture of reality. Despite this sceptical anti-realism, the Buddhas focus on the causes of suffering also suggests that phenomena  although constructed and ultimately unreal  follow a regular order, and so are in some sense objectively real. Two orientations to the Buddhas Dhamma can thus be identified, anti-realism and constructed realism, which are roughly equivalent to what the canonical teachings term no view and correct view. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The buddha was a mere man who pointed the way, kind of like a really good personal trainer. Worshipping him and treating him as some sort of divine being and praying to him accordingly goes against everything he taught.

One of Buddha's epithets is even *devatideva* which literally means "god above the gods".

 On the other hand, in western countries those who discover Buddhism later in life are much more likely to follow it as it was intended.

Thus all Asian Buddhists have got it wrong for about 2500 years and all scholars of Buddhism have got it wrong, too.

<TEXT> Epictetus' words about the death of loved ones are extreme indeed, but don't forget that the Enchiridion is just a short compilation of Epictetus' sayings. I prefer the Discourses of Epictetus because there is significantly more context and he sounds much more like a human there. Epictetus says that these strong emotions are part of human nature and thus it is competely normal to experience them. We are no statues after all! However, it is expected from a Stoic to reflect on one's strong emotions at some point and deal with them accordingly. Stoicism is not as much about not experiencing strong emotions as about how to deal with them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that there are really a lot of subscribers. Even if we consider that only a small part of that is actively posting here, it may be rather naive to think that these are mostly trained mathematicians. I think that popular science articles certainly should have some place due to the different levels of our members, but they are often irrelevant to advanced mathematicians and belong to the kind of submissions we usually see many complaints about. Introducing flairs and the possibility of filtering posts certainly is helpful and may make this sub more interesting to a lot of users. </TEXT>

  I have taught the Dhamma compared to a raft, for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto. Understanding the Dhamma as taught compared to a raft, you should let go even of Dhammas, to say nothing of non-Dhammas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are more suttas containing a parable about crossing a river with a raft. The interpretations are different. You are right about the Asivisa Sutta, but not about other versions of the parable in other suttas. In the [Alagaddupama Sutta](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html) we read:

 "And what should the man do in order to be doing what should be done with the raft? There is the case where the man, having crossed over, would think, 'How useful this raft has been to me! For it was in dependence on this raft that, making an effort with my hands   feet, I have crossed over to safety on the further shore. Why don't I, having dragged it on dry land or sinking it in the water, go wherever I like?' In doing this, he would be doing what should be done with the raft. In the same way, monks, I have taught the Dhamma compared to a raft, for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto. Understanding the Dhamma as taught compared to a raft, you should let go even of Dhammas, to say nothing of non-Dhammas."

Just scroll down to the section with the heading *"The Raft Simile"*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the [Vatican Sayings](http://www.epicurus.net/en/vatican.html) there is a passage (#51) about sexual passion which is certainly applicable to drug consumption, too:

 [addressing a young man] I understand from you that your natural disposition is too much inclined toward sexual passion. Follow your inclination as you will, provided only that you neither violate the laws, disturb well-established customs, harm any one of your neighbors, injure your own body, nor waste your possessions. That you be not checked by one or more of these provisos is impossible; for a man never gets any good from sexual passion, and he is fortunate if he does not receive harm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is an interesting citation of Martha Nussbaum at /r/AskPhilosophy:

[Martha Nussbaum describes Nietzsche, the Stoics and Kant as part of an "anti-compassion" tradition. Who would be part of the "pro-compassion" tradition?](https://np.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/3ufmam/martha_nussbaum_describes_nietzsche_the_stoics/)

 Marcus Aurelius says, if someone is upset, and you know they have wrong values, you can treat them the way an adult treats a child  you can console the child, while understanding that the child is upset over nothing. Thats the Stoic view. In other words, you have to be consistent. You cant say Im going to get rid of anger, jealousy, hatred, but Im going to keep compassion, because its so nice. No, what they say is, the best thing to do is get rid of your unwise attachments to externals, so you wont feel compassion, but you also wont want to hurt people, or to retaliate against them. You will be detached. So Seneca writes to the young emperor Nero on mercy, saying you should be gentle and merciful, but in the middle of the letter is an attack on compassion. Compassion is this soft thing where you care too much about whats out there. And they think in that is the seeds of anger, jealously and ultimately cruelty.

I think she has a point (a big one indeed). Stoicism is often compared to Buddhism and Christianity. Compassion is an essential part of both religious traditions which sets them apart from Stoicism. I feel that the Stoic treatment of suffering people who are not capable in dealing with their pain and grief well enough in the eyes of the Stoic as childlike people being upset over nothing as cold and pretentious.

According to Martha Nussbaum, compassion is not only not part of Stoicism, for a Stoic it is even best to get rid of it completely. How do you reconcile the Stoic position on compassion with Christianity? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The debate on free will is an old one and it's better not to be too hasty. The Stoics were compatibilists and therefore believed that free will is compatible with determinism.

The article [Free Will](http://www.iep.utm.edu/freewill/) by Kevin Timpe gives a good summary on free will and the arguments for compatibilism and incompatibilism.

Last year we had a discussion on free will: [Stoicism and Free Will](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/2hp388/stoicism_and_free_will/). Read, for example, the excellent comments by /u/cleomedes.

<TEXT> Neostoicism is quite interesting indeed. I remember that Michel de Montaigne mentioned Lipsius in his essays in a very positive way. 

 emphasis on mercy and forgiveness

Philanthropy was an essential part of later Stoicism, too, and we shall also not forget that the Stoics thought that people are doing evil things because of ignorance and blindness, which should result in clemency. Thus I think, that mercy and forgiveness are basically compatible with Stoicism. However, there isn't that big emphasis indeed.

Although early Christianity was influenced by Stoicism in some way, the Stoic school was closed by the Emperor Justinian I, because of being at odds with Christianity. The same happened to all other pagan philosophy schools. Which parts of Stoicism, do you think, are particular incompatible with Christianity (regarding moral questions)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There may be more in between in the English speaking world, but at least in the German speaking world I see two opposing trends: on the one side there is Homer as the Everest of literature and on the other side there are popularizations which deviate from Homer strongly.

If you visit a book shop in Germany or Austria, you will find Homer most probably in a very old translation by Voss, of which even Goethe said that it is difficult to read (and he lived at the same time as Voss). This is a big hurdle to most people indeed. There are some other translations, but one has to know that and many of them are not being available as new anymore. </TEXT>

Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another.

([translated by Samuel Butler](http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.1.i.html))

I adore Homer for his characterization of Hector, but he certainly isn't *the* main character of the Iliad. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The transition is [intentional](http://tolkien.slimy.com/tlfaq/TolkienME.html#Tone).

The transition certainly is intentional, however I doubt that the linked explanation is complete.

The article describes the creation context of the book as it can be seen in earlier versions of the story contained in HoME. Tolkien reworked that earier parts completely and although the lighthearted atmosphere and language of the beginning is certainly intentional, it isn't due to Tolkien's earlier intent of writing a sequel for children.

The world of the Hobbits, the Shire, is an idyll full of joy and lightheartedness. That's where the story starts. The language reflects that. But finally, darkness creeps in. Frodo and some other Hobbits leave this idyll and slowly enter an archaic world full of myth and artifacts from ancient times. The language changes accordingly and becomes much more archaic and darker during the transition from the lighthearted idyll to the archaic world. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Frances Collins led the project to map the human genome and also denied evolution

I doubt that. Francis Collins founded [The BioLogos Foundation](https://biologos.org/) which advocates that Christianity can be reconciled [with acceptance of evolution and science](https://biologos.org/about-us/):

 We believe that the diversity and interrelation of all life on earth are best explained by the God-ordained process of evolution with common descent. Thus, evolution is not in opposition to God, but a means by which God providentially achieves his purposes. Therefore, we reject ideologies that claim that evolution is a purposeless process or that evolution replaces God.

As the founder Francis Collins certainly does not deny evolution, unless he changed his opinion since then. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The pyramids contain some narrow corridors and one or more burial chambers, but apart from that they consist of stone. There simply is not enough space for storing much grain. Building the pyramids was so tremendously difficult that building them would be a challenge even today, if we wanted to build pyramids like those in Gizeh. And the form of pyramids is very inefficient for storing grain anyway. The walls of the burial chambers are full of hieroglyphs leaving no room for doubt that pyramids were tombs.

There is a lot of evidence for pyramids being tombs, but none for pyramids being grain stores. The idea that pyramids were built as grain stores is extraordinarily ridiculous. Ben Carson has been one of the best, most respectable and most famous brain surgeons during his active career as physician. As brain surgeon he deserves the greatest admiration. It is really sad that someone like Ben Carson, who certainly is not stupid, says stupid things like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  i think its important to point out that liking what some people said or did doesnt mean liking their *school*.

That's certainly right, but that's not exactly what I wanted to convey. Well, we seem to be in broad agreement anyway. And thanks for your note about epistle 92.

Seneca, however, seems to be somehow a special case. While others like Marcus Aurelius just liked some of Epicurus' sayings, Seneca generally was very willing to adopt parts of other philosophies like Epicureanism, Platonism and other schools, such that Seneca can be seen as an ecclectic to some degree, although he clearly refers to himself as an Stoic. Seneca quoted Epicurus regularly, more often than it is expected for a Stoic, [his references](http://newepicurean.com/suggested-reading/senecas-references-to-epicurus/) sound surprisingly often like refering to an authority.

But then, all that should not blind us to the fact, that Seneca was a Stoic, that Stoicism and Epicureanism were (and are) opposed philosophies (although they seem to be much more similar to us today than to the ancient philosophers).

By the way, there is an earlier discussion about [Seneca's Letters and Epicurus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/29m0q3/senecas_letters_and_epicurus/). </TEXT>

This is *the* most common misconception of Epicurus until today indeed. In fact Epicurus lived a rather ascetic life and represented a very considerate hedonism. Virtue plays a huge role, too, the main difference to the Stoics is that according to Epicurus virtue is necessary (but not sufficient) for a happy life, while for the Stoics virtue is sufficient. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  it was what the stoics themselves said and others as well about the epicureans.

You are not wrong, but at least for some of the later Stoics we have to differenciate more carefully. Seneca, for example, generally did not write about Epicurus badly: [Seneca's references to Epicurus](http://newepicurean.com/suggested-reading/senecas-references-to-epicurus/).

Marcus Aurelius also mentions Epicurus positively several times in his Meditations and [according to *The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy*](http://www.iep.utm.edu/marcus/) he

 did find time to establish four Chairs of Philosophy in Athens, one for each of the principal philosophical traditions (Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, and Epicurean).

Epictetus on the other hand argues against Epicurus and other philosophical schools, although not viciously like earlier Stoics unfortunately did. </TEXT>

These are only some examples which spring to my mind:

* Karl Popper, Hans Albert and generally proponents of critical rationalism have written very influental and comprehensible books.

* On do not have to share all of their opinions, but there have been several Marxist philosophers who had a big impact on some parts of society.

* Existentialism is basically dead now, but its influence on Western culture in the 20th century was huge.

* Bertrand Russell is certainly a very good example, too, or Michel Foucault, who has been linked here some weeks ago by /u/parolang.

* Although I generally do not share all of his opinions, I read Peter Singer's *"How are we to live?"* several years ago and found it a very interesting read (it doesn't contain the controversial issues Singer is famous for).

<TEXT>  But first, why isn't Stoicism a religion?

I don't think that Stoicism is a religion and looking at the history of Stoicism, especially at its founders, makes this rather clear. This was a complete philosophical system of physics, logics and ethics. Stoicism is philosophy and certainly not just a philosophy of life, at least as long as it was a living tradition. In ancient days philosophy generally was not just for an ivory tower (which the best of today's philosophy isn't for, either).

However, there are certainly some religious characteristics, as we would call them today, especially in late Stoicism: look, for example, how Marcus Aurelius talks about what is *Allnatur* in German translations (I think George Long translates it as *nature of the universal*). These religious characteristics were rather unexpected by me, when I first read Marcus Aurelius (which was before I engaged myself in studying Stoicism). </TEXT>

<TEXT> **About the paper**

Lucretius tells us that the key to happiness lies in recognizing the indifference of the gods and the mortality of the soul. Vergil's Aneid shows us a world in which these principles are overturned. In the Aneid religion wins.

In the Dido episode, which Julia Hejduk discusses in her paper, Vergil employs Lucretian language and imaginary to contradict Lucretian doctrine. Dido's shifting relationship to Epicureanism is an important aspect of her character. Vergil portrays Dido's fall partly as a clash between Epicureanism and the supernatural imaginary found in the Aneid. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You should always be in control of yourself, and even if you feel powerful impulses, they should still be under the dictates of your reason.

This *always* is something which may have a strong deterrent effect to people not familiar with the details of Stoicism, because it is very virtually impossible for a human to be *always* in control of oneself. According to Epictetus it is quite normal to be affected by strong emotions, passions, at first indeed. We are no statues after all. However, a Stoic should reflect upon the situation soon after the strong emotional state has calmed down, obtain control again and act rationally. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  good passions

What is a *good passion* (apart from being an oxymoron)? You most probably wanted to write *emotions* which are divided into *feelings* and *passions*. The latter are always bad because they interfere with ones ability to make rational decisions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the mistake isn't that it is the wrong word, which it isn't (at least *compassion* is what the word in the original languages means), but that it isn't clear enough that it is only unwanted as long it is a passion. It can also be a feeling, though, in which case compassion is virtuous. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Compassion to be an unwanted passion

The term *unwanted passion* implies that there is something like a *wanted passion* which is not the case at all. The problem is not compassion, the problem is passion. As a matter of fact, as long as compassion is not a passion but a feeling, it is virtuous like wisdom, justice, bravery, temperance and generosity. So let's have a look at [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_stoicism.2C_considered_as_a_philosophy_of_life_in_modern_times.3F):

 * Passions are emotions caused or reinforced by a belief that something not up to us is either good or bad; they are symptoms of mistaken beliefs about good and bad.

 * Feelings, emotions not accompanied by such a belief, may be pleasant or unpleasant, but not strong enough to affect ones quality of life, or interfere with ones ability to make rational decisions.

 * An impeccable character (Sage) has feelings, but no passions.

And especially

 * As social beings (such as humans) mature, their natural impulses expand from helping themselves alone to their families, cities, nations, the community of all rational beings, and the universe itself.

The point is, that passions interfere with ones ability to make rational decisions which is a really, really bad thing for a Stoic. Compassion is an emotion which can either be a feeling or a passion. While the latter interferes with the Stoic's capacity to help, the former motivates a Stoic to help. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  proof that the camera was inspected

I guess that's the obvious reason, but not precisely my point. A seller may be honest and sell a a camera meeting his description. In this case it is completely understandable that the seller wants to prevent invalid claims by the buyer. However, the seller may also be dishonest and eventually make the invalid claim that the camera was OK when it was sold by showing the video. If a damage is very obvious, but overlooked by the buyer, the latter may eventually work.

The question is, how common the video taping is in the buyer's country. I am fine with a seller accompanied by a second person, but I have never seen or heard that someone was video taping a potential buyer before (apart from cameras in shops). If the video taping is as unusual as it is here where I live, this shall make the potential buyer suspicious indeed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fully agree that Epicureans and Stoics certainly should not be enemies any more and I am interested in both philosophies myself. I further agree that one may take what one likes from both, but at the end one may be neither Epicurean nor Stoic, in which case one should at least be honest and not call oneself Epicurean or Stoic.

Looking closer, Epicureanism and Stoicism have more in common than ancient rivalry may suggest, but in a way they are necessarily opposed, though. For Epicureans pleasure is the highest good, while for Stoics it is virtue being the highest good. No matter how much Epicureanism and Stoicism have in common, pleasure and virtue cannot be the highest good at the same time.

By the way, even ancient rivalry was not unambiguous. Seneca and Marcus Aurelius mentioned Epicurus positively. I remember reading somewhere that Marcus even reopened the Epicurean school in Athens, but I have forgotten the source, so take this with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being familiar with Stoicism, we know that in reality it's mostly our imaginations, our emotions, and our thoughts we are anxious about. Unfortunately, we cannot just decide to be Stoic sages having everything under control, but we can learn how to improve our control step by step. We may not be able to stop struggling completely, but we can improve. Don't be angry with yourself or sorry about your struggles.

Thinking about what a Stoic sage would do has shown to be helpful. Most times the biggest problem is just to do what I am anxious about. But as soon as I simply do it and focus at the moment and what is virtuous to do, things are not nearly as bad as imagined and nothing to be anxious about. Start with simple things, reflect on your day in the evening, maybe imagine what a Stoic sage may say. Again, don't be angry with yourself or sorry about your struggles.

 Has anyone else had to overcome similar troubles?

You have just become familiar with someone struggling with Stoic thought and practice: Marcus Aurelius. He wrote many of his strong affirmations because of his struggles and failures! I think that keeping a philosophical diary like Marcus' Meditations helps a lot and you may do the same. </TEXT>

 In an effort to distance himself from the Democritan conception of the atomic particle, Epicurus posited three essential characteristics to explain the movement of atoms in the void - mass, velocity and something that has puzzled ancient and modern thinkers, called the klinamen. This occurrence was an hypothesized shift in the linear trajectory of an atom at an entirely unexpected and random point in time, and explains how compounds came to be formed in the Epicurean universe, where atoms fall unhindered in parallel to one another. I argue that the klinamen is not an entirely random occurrence but is instead a phenomenon predicated upon the laws of modern physics, the Newtonian laws of motion and gravitation in particular. I further posit that the klinamen is an entirely necessary aspect of the development of the universe from its initial origins of atoms and void (Epicur. Phys. 1.13,14; Ep. Hdt. 39). </TEXT>

 In this article, the monistic ontology of the Eleatic school of ancient Greece is examined in juxtaposition with the nondualistic Advaita Vedanta philosophy of India. The Eleatic ontology is studied through the texts of, firstly, Melissus of Samos, and, secondly, Parmenides of Elea. The characteristic features of Advaita doctrine are gathered from Upanishadic texts and the writings of Sankara. This comparative treatment demonstrates that Being, as described in the Eleatic fragments, is practically identical to the Self (or atman) which lies at the heart of Advaita doctrine. So close is this identity that the two ontologies, the Western and the Eastern, can for all practical purposes be treated as one. In the absence of convincing historical evidence to show that the one ontology exerted a direct influence upon the other, the ineluctable conclusion is that knowledge of the One Being or Self, the immortal essence and true common identity of every creature, was attained independently if not indeed contemporaneously by sages in archaic Greece and in ancient India. This conclusion, moreover, has vital practical significance at the present time: the Eleatic-Vedantic ontology is arguably the key to healing many ills which beset our age. </TEXT>

His conclusion:

 Killing "in the name of conservation" or "in the name of education" or "in the name of whatever" simply needs to stop. It is wrong and sets a horrific precedent for future research and for children. Imagine what a youngster would think if he or she heard something like, "I met a rare and gorgeous bird today ... and I killed him." Even if this handsome male were a member of a common species, there was no reason to kill him. It sickens me that this practice continues and I hope more people will work hard to put an end to it right now, before more fascinating animals are killed. </TEXT>

The *Letter to Menoeceus* is a short and very understandable introduction to the ethical part of Epicurus' philosophy and you may want to read it soon. The *Principal Doctrines* are a great read, the *Letter to Menoeceus*, however, is a little bit more systematic.

In your case I'd finish reading the *Principal Doctrines* (I second /u/ErraticVole's advice) and continue with the letter, unless you are still having a hard time, in which case I'd interupt to read the letter before finishing the *Principal Doctrines*. </TEXT>

[**Individual Aesthetic Preferences for Faces Are Shaped Mostly by Environments, Not Genes**](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2815%2901019-2)

by Laura Germine, Richard Russell, P. Matthew Bronstad, Gabrilla A.M. Blokland, Jordan W. Smoller, Holum Kwok, Samuel E. Anthony, Ken Nakayama, Gillian Rhodes, Jeremy B. Wilmer

 **Summary**

 Although certain characteristics of human faces are broadly considered more attractive (e.g., symmetry, averageness), people also routinely disagree with each other on the relative attractiveness of faces. That is, to some significant degree, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Here, we investigate the origins of these individual differences in face preferences using a twin design, allowing us to estimate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental variation to individual face attractiveness judgments or face preferences. We first show that individual face preferences (IP) can be reliably measured and are readily dissociable from other types of attractiveness judgments (e.g., judgments of scenes, objects). Next, we show that individual face preferences result primarily from environments that are unique to each individual. This is in striking contrast to individual differences in face identity recognition, which result primarily from variations in genes. We thus complete an etiological double dissociation between two core domains of social perception (judgments of identity versus attractiveness) within the same visual stimulus (the face). At the same time, we provide an example, rare in behavioral genetics, of a reliably and objectively measured behavioral characteristic where variations are shaped mostly by the environment. The large impact of experience on individual face preferences provides a novel window into the evolution and architecture of the social brain, while lending new empirical support to the long-standing claim that environments shape individual notions of what is attractive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Tolkien was Anglican.

Most Christians in England are Anglican indeed. However, [Tolkien was a devout Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien#Religion). The Wikipedia article cites his grandson Simon Tolkien:

 I vividly remember going to church with him in Bournemouth. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English. My grandfather obviously didn't agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.

<TEXT> For us outsiders that's hard to understand indeed, but looking at the details reveals some significant differences, though. Two conflicting doctrines cannot both be true. The bible contains several books by different authors who lived at different places and at different times. There is no single right way to interpret texts like that.

Denominations also differ in how important tradition is: in Catholicism tradition is very important which is even part of their doctrine, while protestants acknowledge only the bible as source of authority and tend to deny that tradition should play such a big role (although that's far from what is true in practice).

At the end of the day, there is no objective way to decide who is right. Fundamentalists, however, cannot accept that and think they know the whole truth and consequently all others have to be wrong.

 Along the same lines, aren't Jew's very much the same kind of Christian?

Judaism is a very different religion than Christianity, although there are some common doctrines, though (Christians and Jews share the same god, for example). Also don't forget the long history of antisemitism and persecution of the Jews by Christians. Jews may acknowledge Jesus being a Jew, but he wasn't the messiah. </TEXT>

Julian Porteous is being accused by one person who does not like Porteous' opinion. This is a campaign by Rodney Croome, who is spokesman for Tasmania's Gay and Lesbian Rights Group and National Convenor of Australian Marriage Equality, which unfortunately has found huge media attention.

I assume that it is possible for everyone to accuse anybody of violating the Anti-Discrimination Act. That does not mean that one is automatically guilty or that the state wants to punish one as soon as one is accused by someone.

That being said, this is crazy nevertheless. </TEXT>

Hammond and according to them, Tolkien was familiar with Finnish to some degree, but apparently not enough to translate it. Tolkien wrote some papers about the Kalevala, but he certainly *retold* the story. They also cite a letter from 1955 to Auden in which Tolkien writes:

 I never learned Finnish well enough to do more than plod through a bit of the original. </TEXT>

[**Enceladuss measured physical libration requires a global subsurface ocean**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103515003899)

by P.C. Thomas, R. Tajeddine, M.S. Tiscareno, J.A. Burns, J. Joseph, T.J. Loredo, P. Helfenstein, C. Porco

 **Abstract**

 Several planetary satellites apparently have subsurface seas that are of great interest for, among other reasons, their possible habitability. The geologically diverse Saturnian satellite Enceladus vigorously vents liquid water and vapor from fractures within a south polar depression and thus must have a liquid reservoir or active melting. However, the extent and location of any subsurface liquid region is not directly observable. We use measurements of control points across the surface of Enceladus accumulated over seven years of spacecraft observations to determine the satellites precise rotation state, finding a forced physical libration of 0.120  0.014 (2). This value is too large to be consistent with Enceladuss core being rigidly connected to its surface, and thus implies the presence of a global ocean rather than a localized polar sea. The maintenance of a global ocean within Enceladus is problematic according to many thermal models and so may constrain satellite properties or require a surprisingly dissipative Saturn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are right, there is a major error indeed!

 The article also incorrectly calls the mayapple a Himalayan plant when it's an American plant native to eastern North America.

Let's have a look at the [original paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6253/1224) and the relevant part of the abstract:

 We used transcriptome mining in *Podophyllum hexandrum* (mayapple) to identify biosynthetic genes in the podophyllotoxin pathway.

*Podophyllum hexandrum* is the Himalayan mayapple. Thus, the phys.org article has got the photo wrong, but is right about the plant being Himalayan.

edit: according to the [original paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6253/1224) tobacco plants were used. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](http://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/443/690)

 In this essay I explore the nature of Deleuzes commitment to an affirmative naturalism that is based on certain Epicurean principles and insights. The essay is divided into two main parts. In the first part I bring to light some of the key features of Lucretiuss great poem on the nature of things, and I do so with the aid of Bergson and his reading of the teaching as fundamentally melancholic. In the second part I switch my attention to Deleuze and show how he links together physics and ethics as a way of providing an emancipatory and affirmative philosophy of life and one that aims to defeat sadness. In the conclusion I return to the question of melancholy and indicate how the problem might be best negotiated.

<TEXT> John Sellars starts his article with

 A recurring theme in popular discussions of Stoicism is a perceived affinity between Stoicism and mindfulness techniques adapted from Buddhism.

and then

 I want to suggest that the Stoics did have their own version of mindfulness but that it was quite different from the modern version adapted from Buddhism.

I have no clue why you write

 I appears to me that an attempt is being made to brand stoicism as a western buddhism.

in regard to this article because that has nothing to do with this article. Have you read it? </TEXT>

[**Abstract**](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6252/1106)

 Growing up on a dairy farm protects children from allergy, hay fever, and asthma. A mechanism linking exposure to this endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide)rich environment with protection has remained elusive. Here we show that chronic exposure to low-dose endotoxin or farm dust protects mice from developing house dust mite (HDM)induced asthma. Endotoxin reduced epithelial cell cytokines that activate dendritic cells (DCs), thus suppressing type 2 immunity to HDMs. Loss of the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 in lung epithelium abolished the protective effect. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding A20 was associated with allergy and asthma risk in children growing up on farms. Thus, the farming environment protects from allergy by modifying the communication between barrier epithelial cells and DCs through A20 induction. </TEXT>

 In this essay I examine the relationship between Sartre's phenomenological description of the "self" as expressed in his early work (especially *Being and Nothingness*) and elements to be found in some approaches to Buddhism. The vast enormity of this task will be obvious to anyone who is aware of the numerous schools and traditions through which the religion of Buddhism has manifested itself. In order to be brief, I have decided to select specific aspects of what is commonly called the Theravadin tradition as being representative of Buddhist philosophy. By choosing to look primarily at the Theravadin tradition, I am by necessity ignoring a vast number of other Buddhist approaches. However, in my view, the Theravadin sect presents a consistent Buddhist philosophy which is representative of many of the major trends within Buddhism. </TEXT>

 The Blessed One said, "When touched with a feeling of pain, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person sorrows, grieves,   laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. So he feels two pains, physical   mental. Just as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and, right afterward, were to shoot him with another one, so that he would feel the pains of two arrows; in the same way, when touched with a feeling of pain, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person sorrows, grieves,   laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. So he feels two pains, physical   mental.

As zoom lens you may prefer the 18-105mm to the 18-55mm, if you can, because the 18-105mm is significantly better and offers a very nice zoom range. A used 16-85mm may be within your budget, too. Add the Nikon 1.8/35mm DX and you have everything you need. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](http://www.sorenkierkegaard.nl/artikelen/Engels/019.%20Human%20insufficiency%20in%20Shinran%20and%20Kierkegaard.pdf)

 Shinran (1173-1263), the founder of the Jodoshinshu of Japanese Pure Land Buddhism, and Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), the Danish father of Christian existentialism, belong to very different eras, cultures, and religious traditions. Yet there are striking similarities between their religious philosophies, especially in how both offer theistic views emphasising faith and grace that see the person as radically insufficient to attain complete self-transformation. Both claim that the human person is so radically insufficient that no one can attain Buddhist enlightenment or Christian salvation through his or her own power, but only through divine power. I will argue against some commentators that although the Deity accepts and transforms this insufficiency, even the power of the Deity does not eradicate human insufficiency in this life for the person of faith. I will also argue that Shinran and Kierkegaard differ significantly about the role of human freedom in faith, and that this difference expresses the central difference between Mahayana Buddhism and Christianity regarding the relationship between the person and the Deity. </TEXT>

There are subs about spirituality, there are subs about debating religion, asking questions about religion and many more.

There are not a lot of people who actively engage in interfaith discussions apart from debating.

When this sub was founded, people had concerns about a sub just for pointing out how stupid people are. These concerns were answered by explaining that this sub is for educational purposes. The reality is, that this sub has turned out to be about circle jerking for being better than those arrogant Westerners who believe to know everything better than all Asians and scholars. These arrogant Westerners exist and their crap should be pointed out indeed, but if this sub was meant to be for educational purposes, this circle jerking subverts the original porpose of this sub completely. </TEXT>

At least some of the presupposition are certainly flawed, but asking a question is still completely legitimate and entirely different to stating crap with utter conviction. Why should posting a link to the question be prefered to answering the question and pointing out the misconceptions? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Okay, so it's a century old but don't knock it because of that. A century isn't long ago at all.

I would never decide not to read a book because it is old and agree with what you have written about human progress above and with what you have written about reading and writing below. These old philosophical and literary texts certainly could not be as relevant today, if the differences between the ancient world and the modern one were as significant as many people seem to believe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's so sad, but unfortunately also much too common.

I still remember the time when there wasn't anything like mobiles. We had a very good time then. I have refused using a mobile for a long time, but finally I bought one about three years ago. It isn't a smartphone, though. It's just a tough mobile which is shock- and waterproof, since I love hiking and being in nature.

I am very concerned about many people around me being absorbed by their smartphone while walking and even driving. That's very dangerous for them, but unfortunately also for other people. A world without mobiles seems to be completely incomprehensible for a lot of people. I often see a couple sitting in a caf or restaurant and both of them are absorbed by their smartphones.

There does not seem to be a world without smartphones for more and more people. Life seems to run away from them without being noticed and they do not consciously miss anything. Many of these people are like zombies. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I have heard that Buddhism influenced Greek philosophy or vice-versa: this may be a spurious claim though.

There were some philosophers who accompanied Alexander the Great to India. Two of these were Anaxarchos, after whom I chose my user name, and Pyrrho of Elis, who was the founder of the school of skepticism which is called *Pyrrhonian skepticism*. They certainly had contact with philosophers and Buddhists and were influenced by them.

It is said that Pyrrhonian skepticism was significantly influenced by Buddhism, there is even a book about this (*Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism* by Adrian Kuzminski) and several papers and other sources which are mentioned [here](http://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=102 t=7969) at Dharma Wheel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This video, at least the three minutes you are pointing to, is horrible. Not only does he fail to understand Stoicism, his position is a rather ideologic, religious one. Scientism is an ideology and has never been a rational position. The ancient people had nothing, he says, Marcus Aurelius did not even have a play station. What is this guy smoking?

He thinks that science is going to solve all problems, he even talks about changing one's neurons in our brains to solve problems... What he seems to wish is very similar to some dystopic scenarios we know from science fiction films where the evil guys argue exactly like this one in the video.

 Okay, I have to agree that Stoicism was in fact a method of coping with a shitty existence in ancient times.

I do not agree. Stoicism has never been a method. Stoicism is a philosophy. Stoicism is certainly a philosophy which also offers methods for coping with the bad sides of the human condition, but it is first and foremost a philosophy. </TEXT>

[Navigable networks as Nash equilibria of navigation games](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150703/ncomms8651/full/ncomms8651.html)

by Andrs Gulys, Jzsef J. Br, Attila Krsi, Gbor Rtvri and Dmitri Krioukov

 **Abstract**

 Common sense suggests that networks are not random mazes of purposeless connections, but that these connections are organized so that networks can perform their functions well. One function common to many networks is targeted transport or navigation. Here, using game theory, we show that minimalistic networks designed to maximize the navigation efficiency at minimal cost share basic structural properties with real networks. These idealistic networks are Nash equilibria of a network construction game whose purpose is to find an optimal trade-off between the network cost and navigability. We show that these skeletons are present in the Internet, metabolic, English word, US airport, Hungarian road networks, and in a structural network of the human brain. The knowledge of these skeletons allows one to identify the minimal number of edges, by altering which one can efficiently improve or paralyse navigation in the network. </TEXT>

Sometimes I take my 14-150mm instead which fits in the same bag as well (without a second lens, though). This fits in a very small camera bag which I either carry over my shoulder or in my backbag.

I still have to find a photography backbag which has a compact enough section for camera gear and a large enough section for everything else. On the other hand, my solution fits my needs perfectly fine. </TEXT>

However, this subreddit is a very civil and fine community. So we should not understand the announcement of the new group as enticement of users, as an invitation to move, but as an addition instead.

That being said, when I joined Snapzu, I got three invitation codes which are still unused. Everybody can read and take openly published codes and that's why I removed the codes after posting them here yesterday. If you want an invitation code, please feel free to send me a PM: if you are an active member of this group, you will get one as long as I have one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My answer to the first part of your comment concerning the banned subreddits is:

I didn't frequent them either, but at least I looked into one of them because a discussion in /r/Stoicism. As far as I know about the banned subreddits, if banning them meant the end of reddit, the end of reddit would be well-deserved. That does not mean that everything is ok with reddit, but one has to look more closely who complains loudly concerning freedom of speech and why. Sometimes it's not because freedom of speech at all. </TEXT>

Although I grant that there could be questions not to be asked for legal reasons, dismissioning moderators and banning users because of hard questions seems to be a rather vicious act to me. Being able to cope with critical voices virtuously would be so much better than reacting like that, but it seems that it's more trendy to disallow everything which could interfere with what I'd call a narcissistically oriented self-image. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The impact of Luther's translation is huge indeed. I want to add that Luther was the first who published the protestant New Testament, but the first complete protestant bible was the *Zrcher Bibel* of 1531. Huldrych Zwingli was one of its translators.

Revisions of both bible translations are still in use. While the Luther bible has been revised carefully to keep Luther's language as much as possible, the Zrcher bible has been retranslated several times (the last time in 2007) and is both more precise and easier to understand than the Luther bible.

<TEXT>  Today, there is a big general incentive towards healthier lifestyles (among first-worlders). Gluten-free diet, veganism, you name it.

The claims of these people are mostly not supported by scientific research at all. Many of these "healthier" lifestyles are actually rather unhealthy.

 This alone turns me off. At this point, there are very few people on earth who follow a gluten-free diet that I might take seriously. It's like a religion, they want you to join their side so much. I say this because I know it is a turnoff for many other people.

You are right with your comparison with religion. This is turning off a lot of serious people indeed.

 Meditation is real. It's not a belief.

Yes, and that's why it is good to see scientific research being done which shows exactly that meditation is a real thing. On the other hand, opposing scientific research or showing its results, respectively, is exactly what fits better with bullshit. I wouldn't expect that from someone who calls himself *a very no-bullshit person*.

Posting links to every wishy-washy article about positive effects of meditation is certainly contraproductive, but posting links to articles being based on sound scientific research should be perfectly fine. I think, opposing that is contraproductive, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  "Epicureanism" *The History of Evil*, Volume 1: *The History of Evil in Antiquity (2000BCE-450CE)*, edited by Tom Angier. Routledge. Forthcoming.

 Epicurus did not discuss evil as theological problem. He was interested in the practical problem of living well, and his discussion of goods and evils is part of his solution to this problem. It is in this connection that Epicurus makes a lasting contribution to understanding evil and its causes. He rejected the dominate line of thought from the classical tradition of Plato and Aristotle. Epicurus seems to have been an empiricist, not a rationalist. From within this perspective, he developed a new understanding of the good life.

I agree. This trend is stupid. As far as I am concerned, I have never decided not to buy a recording because it is available on YouTube anyway, but I know that I would not have bought several recordings, if I had not heard them (or parts of them) on YouTube before. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  **Abstract**

 This essay proposes to share with the readers some of the experiences of using commentaries on Sanskrit texts, particularly philosophical texts. No Sanskrit work can be understood properly or adequately without the help of commentaries yet the commentators were not and could not be omniscient. After providing an overview of how ancient texts in India were taught by the gurus and how in course of time commentary writing side by side oral instruction came into being, it is shown that all commentaries cannot be reliable on all occasions. The time lag between the base text and the commentaries thereon often disables the commentators to be certain about the collocation of the words, especially technical words in the base text. Secondly, lack of historical sense often makes the commentators opt for untenable significations of certain terms occurring in the base text. Thirdly, the personal philosophical affiliation of the commentators often misleads them to interpret the text in a way inconsistent with the intention of the original author. All this has been shown with examples selected from various texts, philosophical and otherwise, and their commentaries. The essay concludes that commentaries are doubtless necessary and helpful and should be made use of wherever available; nevertheless it must be kept in mind that ancient commentators were no less, if not more, fallible than we are and their works should be treated with caution, not regarding them as the last word, as some students and scholars still do. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The reason why the Stoics could remain calm and equitable, and why they thought that was a good thing to be, and how they went about attaining that state, was because they believed in divine providence

This is what I can agree to, as long as *divine* is not meant in any theistic sense. From that on, I think, you are mixing Stoicism and Christianity up which unnecessarily invalidates your point to a large extent. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  So the fact that their philosophical system included the gods (plural) was unremarkable.

Did it include the gods? Actually, it did not. That's the point you miss. Their theology was not polytheistic, which was the given in ancient Rome and Greece, their God is pantheistic and rather similar to Spinoza's God. Basically, one can use *God* and *Nature* interchangeably. Take that and providence away and you leave Stoicism. The point is: what you claim as fact is not the case at all.

 in our modern world atheism is a given.

In our modern world secularism, the separation of state and religion, is a given (at least in Western democracies). Atheism is still the minor position.

 The essence of the Stoic life is self-reliance, the capacity to remain calm and equable in the face of whatever life throws at you.

The essence of Stoicism is that *arete* (excellence of character, virtue) is necessary and sufficient for *eudaimonia* (human flourishing, happiness in life).

 That attitude is totally antithetical to reliance on the grace of a superior being, which is the hallmark of Christianity.

It's true that Stoicism is *antithetical to reliance on the grace of a superior being*. But I cannot fully agree otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fear of pain is something I think Epicurus' argumentation may not be as helpful for as his argumentation concerning the fear of the gods and the fear of death. According to Epicurus, strong pain only lasts for a short while and long lasting pain is not strong. In ancient Greece that may have been the case, since most problems which lead to strong pain most probably lead to death soon in ancient times. That certainly isn't true anymore (if it ever was true), because illnesses and injuries which once lead to imminent death can be cured today. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  As for your other point, could you point to any text supporting your position on a single god in Stoicism?

Read, for example, the Chapter *4. Stoic physics* from John Sellars' [*Stoicism*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources isbn=0520249089), beginning at page 91 (*God and Nature*). According to Sellars the Stoic God was a philosophical god and can be seen as *the providential ruling force in Nature*. The Stoics can be seen as pantheists identifying God with Nature. It was also common among Stoics to see Nature as a living being. Sellars points to the theological discussions in Cicero's *On the Nature of the Gods*, Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus and Diogenes Laertius.

 Stoicism was Greek and Roman, and by no stretch of the imagination was Graeco-Roman religion monotheistic.

In ancient Rome they had to follow the usual ritualistic acts and this they certainly did. However, Stoic theology was rather different to Roman polytheism. On the other hand, I would not call their theology *monotheistic* because that refers to a personal god. /u/paniniconqueso basically describes the Stoic God as monotheistic god which is certainly not true. The Stoic God was a pantheistic God, the Stoics identified God with Nature.

 Saying that their many gods represented a single entity is again a Christian reinterpretation of their beliefs.

The monotheistic interpretation of the Stoic God certainly is a Christian reinterpretation and is wrong. On the other hand, the Stoics were no polytheists, either. </TEXT>

I really like Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, but I am not comfortable with recommending it as a general introduction to Stoicism, since it is the result of Marcus Aurelius' Stoic practice which was never thought to be read by anyone else than Marcus Aurelius himself. For someone knowing what it is, it is highly valuable concerning Stoic practice, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But there is a difference between suggesting a hypothesis because you think it might be supported and having results that actually support the hypothesis, right?

In my opinion you are splitting hairs. It's not a theory, it's just a hypothesis.

 an idea or theory that is not proven but that leads to further study or discussion

[And what did they write](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129118)?

 Mothers, fathers and other family members talk and even sing to the fetus throughout pregnancy with communicative intent. Many report changes in the fetal behaviour as a response to such communication. And although we used the term touch, the condition however was not direct skin-to-skin contact but an indirect stimulation of the fetus via stroking the abdomen applying slight pressure. Similarly to talking to the fetus, most mothers and even fathers attempt to communicate with and regulate the behaviour of the fetus via stroking of the mothers abdomen as a response to the kicking or positional movements of the fetus. Even the expecting mothers mood is affected by massaging the abdomen resulting in reduced depression [[36](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129118#pone.0129118.ref036)].

<TEXT>  **Abstract**

 Despite the increasing attention that has been paid by contemporary scholarship to the place of philosophy within elite Roman society, this article argues that the extent of Epicurean affiliation during the Late-Republic has failed to be adequately recognized or narrated. This study assembles numerous literary and epigraphical sources, of both Epicurean and non-Epicurean provenance, to help refine our understanding of the diffusion of the philosophy during this period. Recent papyri finds from Herculaneum are also integrated into the discussion, allowing the notable influence that Epicurean teachers on the Italian peninsula enjoyed to be demonstrated. </TEXT>

The Buddha did not deny a self indeed, but he definitely denied a permanent self. This teaching is known as *anatta* which is one of the most central Buddhist teachings. According to Buddha there is no permanence at all and that is certainly true for the self.

The self the Buddha did not deny can be seen as what we may describe as an emergent phenomenon of several processes today. Traditionally these are called the *khandhas* (in Pali) or *aggregates* (in English): matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  **Abstract**

 This Masters thesis examines two conflicting images that can be presented in contemporary scholarship on the classical Epicurean movement: that they are either a reclusive and isolated group, or that they had a missionary dynamic/purpose akin to that seen in the later Christian missionary movement. Sources for the first generation of the school are examined, and it is suggested that the Epicurean movement held an open-closed dynamic with regards to mission: incorporating features that both expedite, but also restrict the inclusion of outsiders into the group. Epicurean doctrine is also probed to find features that would either broaden or limited any missionary concept in the school. The closed dynamic is found to have come under pressure in subsequent generations, particularly from Epicurean adherents on Roman soil; where popularisers, in conflict with earlier generations of the school, sought to overtly proselytize their message. Lucretius intention as missionary to the educated elite of Roman is explored, and a chapter examining the extent of Epicurean influence on the Roman elite is also provided. </TEXT>

[Universal decoherence due to gravitational time dilation](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphys3366.html)

by Igor Pikovski, Magdalena Zych, Fabio Costa and aslav Brukner

 **Abstract**

 The physics of low-energy quantum systems is usually studied without explicit consideration of the background spacetime. Phenomena inherent to quantum theory in curved spacetime, such as Hawking radiation, are typically assumed to be relevant only for extreme physical conditions: at high energies and in strong gravitational fields. Here we consider low-energy quantum mechanics in the presence of gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads to the decoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation induces a universal coupling between the internal degrees of freedom and the centre of mass of a composite particle. The resulting correlations lead to decoherence in the particle position, even without any external environment. We also show that the weak time dilation on Earth is already sufficient to affect micrometre-scale objects. Gravity can therefore account for the emergence of classicality and this effect could in principle be tested in future matter-wave experiments. </TEXT>

by Thomas Dietz, Kenneth A. Frank, Cameron T. Whitley, Jennifer Kelly, and Rachel Kelly

 **Abstract**

 Starting at least in the 1970s, empirical work suggested that demographic (population) and economic (affluence) forces are the key drivers of anthropogenic stress on the environment. We evaluate the extent to which politics attenuates the effects of economic and demographic factors on environmental outcomes by examining variation in CO2 emissions across US states and within states over time. We find that demographic and economic forces can in part be offset by politics supportive of the environmentincreases in emissions over time are lower in states that elect legislators with strong environmental records. </TEXT>

[Having a Lot of a Good Thing: Multiple Important Group Memberships as a Source of Self-Esteem](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124609)

by Jolanda Jetten, Nyla R. Branscombe, S. Alexander Haslam, Catherine Haslam, Tegan Cruwys, Janelle M. Jones, Lijuan Cui, Genevieve Dingle, James Liu, Sean Murphy, Anh Thai, Zoe Walter, Airong Zhang

 **Abstract**

 Membership in important social groups can promote a positive identity. We propose and test an identity resource model in which personal self-esteem is boosted by membership in additional important social groups. Belonging to multiple important group memberships predicts personal self-esteem in children (Study 1a), older adults (Study 1b), and former residents of a homeless shelter (Study 1c). Study 2 shows that the effects of multiple important group memberships on personal self-esteem are not reducible to number of interpersonal ties. Studies 3a and 3b provide longitudinal evidence that multiple important group memberships predict personal self-esteem over time. Studies 4 and 5 show that collective self-esteem mediates this effect, suggesting that membership in multiple important groups boosts personal self-esteem because people take pride in, and derive meaning from, important group memberships. Discussion focuses on when and why important group memberships act as a social resource that fuels personal self-esteem. </TEXT>

You are right that Sony has done a significantly better job with the new FE system than they did before and I certainly missed to acknowledge that. However, I had not especially the new FE System in mind, but also NEX where they did by far not the same good job concerning lenses. </TEXT>

When Sony released the NEX system, the 16mm sucked, and their newer 16-50mm is certainly underdesigned. Several Sony Alpha lenses are still old Minolta designs and some of them do not meet today's standards, but that's not much different with some of Canon's and Nikon's older designs. Thus I think that you did not describe the quality of Sony's lenses well by saying that Sony glass sucks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While it is true that Sony has some really excellent lenses and only very few that suck (and as far as I know none of these are native FE), lenses are Sony's weakness nevertheless, however not in the sense as said above. Sony is by far not as quick in releasing lenses as in releasing bodies and although it is hard to catch up with old and complete systems like Canon and Nikon, Sony certainly could do better. Fuji, for example, has been much better in that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We'll have to agree to disagree on the first point. I think "meditation" as a concept has been tainted beyond recovery.

If I do, I use the word *meditation* in context with Stoicism exclusively within groups of people I assume to know more about meditation than the broad public. If I have any reason to assume that people just know the stereotyped understanding of meditation, I will completely abstain from using the word *meditation* in context with Stoicism.

 It's almost inconceivable that the Stoics were unaware of Buddhism and Asian religious traditions considering that the Greek philosophical community was so tight-knit and that philosophers often traveled with men of power.

I may have been much too imprecise by writing that *the ancient Stoics did not know Buddhism and Asian religious traditions*, since we do not know what exactly they knew about other cultures. But we know that, if they had substantial knowledge, at least the Stoics were excellent in hiding that knowledge. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There's too much baggage to continue using the word like we are.

A part of what the Christian tradition used to call *contemplation* is what we call *meditation* today and some of the Stoic's practices were what we call *a kind of meditation* today. It's obvious that you do not like the word *meditation*, but that's no reason not to use the word anymore. There are a lot of meditation techniques and what most people associate it with is just a small part of what is called meditation. The ignorance of most people of a given field should not forbid the usage of some words within that given field.

  ancient Stoics did not know Buddhism and Asian religious traditions

 I'm curious where you got this. Hellenistic philosophy absolutely was in direct contact with Buddhist traditions as a result of Alexander's conquests.

Actually, I consciously call myself *subject405* after one of the philosophers who joined Alexander the Great on his trip to Asia. He was no Stoic, though. The influence of Asian philosophy on Greek philosophy is widely overstressed and although it can be argued in favor of an influence on Pyrrhonian skepticism, a direct and substantial influence on Stoicism is far fetched and widely not assumed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The only reason the modern idea of meditation seems to be associated with Stoicism is the title of Marcus Aurelius' Stoic masterwork.

This is not even cheap polemic...

Of course, in Stoicism there is no meditation tradition which is as rich as in Buddhism, but it is totally wrong to say that there is no meditation and mindfulness tradition at all. It is further wrong to say that the meditation rechniques practiced by Buddhists are the only meditation techniques, although it is correct that (apart from mindfulness) the Buddhist meditation techniques are typically not what Stoics practiced.

However, what Stoics practiced is what we call *mindfulness* today. In Stoicism this is called *prosoch* and is described in [Prosoch: Illuminating the Path of the Prokoptn (PDF)](http://collegeofstoicphilosophers.org/show_book/PDF/ChrisFisher-Prosoche-IlluminatingthePathoftheProkopton) to mention one example of literature. There are Stoic practices which can perfectly legitimate and undoubtedly be called *meditation*, although the ancient Stoics did not know Buddhism and Asian religious traditions and there are significant differences concerning the techniques and the meaning and status within the teachings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one of the most cited and misunderstood Suttas and is mostly cited in order to justify free inquiry, strip teachings like rebirth from Buddhism and secularize Buddhism. [Bhikkhu Bodhi writes](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_09.html):

 Though the discourse certainly does counter the decrees of dogmatism and blind faith with a vigorous call for free investigation, it is problematic whether the sutta can support all the positions that have been ascribed to it. On the basis of a single passage, quoted out of context, the Buddha has been made out to be a pragmatic empiricist who dismisses all doctrine and faith, and whose Dhamma is simply a freethinkers kit to truth which invites each one to accept and reject whatever he likes.

 But does the Kalama Sutta really justify such views? Or do we meet in these claims just another set of variations on that egregious old tendency to interpret the Dhamma according to whatever notions are congenial to oneself  or to those to whom one is preaching? </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/9209364/The_Buddhas_skill_in_means_and_the_genesis_of_the_five_aggregate_teaching)

The problem tackled in this article is ambitious. Through examination of how certain fundamental teachings of the Buddha originated  the author argues that those teachings must indeed go back to the Buddha himself. Thus the author builds a chain of argument which creates hypothetical links rather than declaring a priori that links and connection cannot be established.

This article argues that the Alagaddupama Sutta, an important early Buddhist text, portrays the Buddha in the process of formulating his thoughts. If so it contradicts the myth that the Buddha awakened to the entire Buddhist Dharma on one occasion, and should be dated to the fourth century BCE. Such an antiquity, and peculiar didactic structure suggests that the text contains authentic teachings of  the Buddha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The most basic and fundamental teaching of Buddha, *anatta*, that what we experience as self is no permanent and independent substance, but an emergent phenomenon of diverse processes instead, is widely compatible with science and does not need faith anymore. The rest is essentially a consequence of that insight and can mostly be argued for in a very rational way, although there are exceptions like the teaching of rebirth which is difficult to be argued for at least from the standpoint of Western philosophy. </TEXT>

Exactly. That's why I wrote in [my reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/38pyoz/rbuddhism_can_we_tone_down_the_dogma_a_bit/cry8upo)

 Basically, that's what Buddhism is about and what Buddha taught regarding suffering. Withholding what Buddhism offers for the suffering of those seeking advice may even be evil and in my opinion it is evil indeed.

and

 If one is ill and comes to a physician, one is supposed to hear medical advice and to get a medical treatment. Nobody would expect the physician to refrain from dense ramblings about the nature and cure of the illness. This is exactly what the physician is supposed to do and that is true regarding the advice on suffering in /r/Buddhism as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If a lay cultural Buddhist comes here asking for advice to help deal with the sorrow of a recent break up, is it really wise to beat them over the head with dense ramblings about the unreality of the self or universal nature of suffering from attachment?

Basically, that's what Buddhism is about and what Buddha taught regarding suffering. Withholding what Buddhism offers for the suffering of those seeking advice may even be evil and in my opinion it is evil indeed. It surely makes a difference how one talks to each other in such cases, but at the end of the day that's what someone coming here for advice on suffering is supposed to hear. If one comes to /r/Buddhism, one is supposed to read about Buddhism and what Buddhism has to say about one's matter instead of just some psychological phrases for self-help (that's what /r/selfhelp is for).

EDIT: If one is ill and comes to a physician, one is supposed to hear medical advice and to get a medical treatment. Nobody would expect the physician to refrain from *dense ramblings about the nature and cure of the illness*. This is exactly what the physician is supposed to do and that is true regarding the advice on suffering in /r/Buddhism as well. </TEXT>

That's so right. That's one of the reason why I like Damien Keown's highly recommendable book *Buddhism, A Very Short Introduction* so much. It is a short and very clear introduction, but he even manages to explain such relatively unknown facts like Buddhist hells and heaven. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only few people are trained in critical thinking, most pick up all sort of things and believe they know something. Unfortunately, a lot of people call themselves Buddhists and don't have a clue. There are even introductionary books about Buddhism written by people not having a clue at all.

There are people who seem to believe that Hermann Hesse's *Siddhartha* is an introduction to Buddhism and Robert M. Pirsig's *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* is about Zen and Benjamin Hoff's *The Tao of Pooh* is about Taoism. *The Tao of Pooh*, for example, is often recommended by people calling themselves Taoists and someone who does not have a clue may think that these people knew what they are talking (or writing) about.

I think, if one doesn't have a clue and listen to people who call themselves *secular Buddhists* or to those who are basically esoterics calling themselves Buddhists, it may be extremely easy to adopt false views about Buddhism. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I get upset when they don't acknoweldge it after an explanation and just get mad

You expect too much because there are only few people who acknowledge their errors in internet forums. Especially irrational people do not respond to rational arguments well.

The best thing is to explain their errors in a sober way and not to expect anything from them. As long as they react in an acceptable manner one can go on discussing the matter with them, but that may not always happen.

By the way, you do not know how many other people read and learn from your comments, so giving expanations may not necessarily be in vain even in the case the people you are answering to react in a negative way. It can still be frustrating, though. </TEXT>

This talk would fit in a list of recommended talks about Buddhism and its teachings, but it is neither bad Eastern philosophy nor is it about bad Eastern philosophy. It is more about Buddhism than philosophy anyway. If there is a list of recommended Buddhist talks at /r/badEasternPhilosophy, this talk may be a good candidate. However, at the moment there does not seem to be such a list (although there used to be one). </TEXT>

<TEXT> He defines exposure as the amount of light falling on the sensor which does not depend on ISO indeed: by raising ISO there won't fall more light on the sensor.

 So why, according to him, would you ever change set the ISO above lowest setting?

That's more tricky. In theory, if we have sensors which are called "ISO-less", raising ISO in the camera and using the slider in Lightroom won't make any difference at all. However, although we can partly do that with Sony sensors of the newest generation as long as we stay below five stops, we are not there yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**

Epicurus (341-270 BC) was, with Plato and Aristotle, one of the three great philosophers of the ancient world. He developed an integrated system of ethics and natural philosophy that, he claimed and many accepted, showed everyone the way to a life of the greatest happiness. The school that he founded remained open for 798 years after his death. While it lost place during the last 200 of these years, his philosophy held until then a wide and often decisive hold on the ancient mind.

The revival of Epicureanism in the 17th century coincided with the growth of scientific rationalism and classical liberalism. There can be no doubt these facts are connected. It may, indeed, be argued that the first was a leading cause of the second two, and that we are now living in a world shaped, in every worthwhile sense, by the ideas of Epicurus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ludwig von Mises writes in *Human Action*:

 The historical role of the theory of the division of labor as elaborated by British political economy from Hume to Ricardo consisted in the complete demolition of all metaphysical doctrines concerning the origin and the operation of social cooperation. It consummated the spiritual, moral and intellectual emancipation of mankind inaugurated by the philosophy of Epicureanism.

The presentation, which was delivered at the Austrian Scholars Conference organized by the Ludwig von Mises Institute in 2005, explains the reasons for this rather strong statement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Description**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05pqsk4)

Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Greek poet Sappho. Born in the late seventh century BC, Sappho spent much of her life on the island of Lesbos. In antiquity she was famed as one of the greatest lyric poets, but owing to a series of accidents the bulk of her work was lost to posterity. The fragments that do survive, however, give a tantalising glimpse of a unique voice of Greek literature. Her work has lived on in other languages, too, translated by such major poets as Ovid, Christina Rossetti and Baudelaire.

<TEXT>  The ultimate worldliness is political activism. We cannot serve two masters. If your trying to take over the world, your in worldliness.

Political activism does not equate with trying to take over the world. Political activism can be a trap indeed, but it can also mean standing up for the poor, the ill, the disadvantaged. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As far as I can say, /r/Buddhism seems to be truer to Buddhism as /r/taoism is to Taoism. Buddhism, Taoism, Stoicism and other ancient religions and philosophies have been popularized and adapted and that's visible in the subreddits, too. The Western popularizations and adaptations reflect the Western lifestyle. Wellness and self-fulfilment surely play a big part.

On the other hand, these traditions have been transformed during their expansion in earlier times, too, and we should not be surprised by the fact that adaptations are being done today. In many cases ancient philosophy are untenable without adaptations anyway. At some point, however, Buddhism being adapted that way ends being true to Buddhism and may better be called differently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fighting ignorance in a subreddit often does not make much sense. Posting relevant links may be more effective because one can reach those who want to learn more easily, since it's not just an opinion of a strange redditor anymore. There are always those who want to stay ignorant, but also those who don't know about their ignorance and want to change that as soon as they realize that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are similarities, of course, especially as long as one does not look too closely. However, the existence of some similarities is not sufficient for common roots and in this case the similarities are rather superficial. As far as I know there is no reason to assume that the Stoics were influenced by Eastern philosophy in any significant way.

There are also similarities between Pyrrhonian skepticism and Buddhism. Pyrrho of Elis, the founder of Pyrrhonian skepticism, travelled to India with Alexander the Great and was influenced by Eastern philosophy that way. By the way, Anaxarchus (Greek:  *Anaxarchos* - after which I chose my user name) accompanied Alexander the Great to India, too.

That being said, one shouldn't stress the inluence of Eastern philosophy on Pyrrhonian skepticism too much, either, although at least there is some influence worth being mentioned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Taoism is probably the most misunderstood religion in the West, even worse than Buddhism. The [Taoism of the Western imagination](https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/kirkland/sites/faculty.franklin.uga.edu.kirkland/files/TENN97.pdf) differs a lot from the original. Imagine storytellers who sit around campfires and tell stories. The so-called Taoism is more or less identified with *Tao of Pooh*. And, of course, the Chinese have got Taoism wrong since everything else than Laozi, Zhuangzi and Liezi is not true Taoism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would start with reading the FAQ carefully. There is a lot of interesting information and you may also follow the links. A good passage about virtue is: [What is Stoicism, considered as a philosophy of life in modern times?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_stoicism.2C_considered_as_a_philosophy_of_life_in_modern_times.3F)

You may also read an [article of William O. Stephens about Stoic ethics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/). If you want to read an ancient work, you may read Cicero's *De Officiis* (On Duties), which is said to be highly influenced by the principal work [*On Duties*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panaetius#On_Duties) of the Stoic Panaetius. Cicero's *De Officiis* is the most comprehensive work about that topic I know of. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  My personal take on Stoicism is that one must always be content, not happy, as happiness is a fleeting feeling like all the rest of ones feelings.

Stoicism is not about being a statue. Stoicism is about *eudaimonia* and the way how to accomplish it. *Eudaimonia* is the Greek word for *happiness*. Stoicism is about happiness. That's the goal and end of life according to Stoicism.

The Stoic conception of *eudaimonia*, which is the life of moral virtue, differs from the conception of other schools defining *eudaimonia* as goal of life. For example, the Epicureans' conception of *eudaimonia* is the life of pleasures. For Epicureans virtue is highly important, too, because it is necessary for *eudaimonia*. It is not sufficient, though, which distinguish them from the Stoics.

Based on your remarks I interpret your understanding of happiness as being more similar to the Epicurean than to the Stoic conception of happiness. One may apply Stoic techniques to cope with difficulties of life successfully, however, one is no Stoic unless one identifies *happiness* with a *live of moral virtue*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [**Description**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00547bk)

Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Humanism. On the 3rd January 106 BC Marcus Tullius Cicero, lawyer, politician, Roman philosopher and the founding father of Humanism was born. His academy, the Studia Humanitas taught the art of living well and blessedly through learning and instruction in the fine arts, his version of humanitas put man not God at the centre of the world.Centuries later, Ciceros teachings had been metamorphosed into Classical Humanism, a faith in the soft arts of the Greek world. But how did Ciceros ideas become Renaissance ideals? How did a small Greek curriculum later become a world philosophy? The human centred creed is credited with giving us human rights and democracy but has also been blamed for the most unspeakable horrors of the modern age. Have his ideas been distorted through the centuries for political ends? And why do some contemporary thinkers think the Humanist tradition is responsible for Elitism, Sexism and even Nazism?

**With**

Tony Davies, Professor and Head of the Department of English, University of Birmingham and author of Humanism

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness  all of them due to the offenders ignorance of what is good or evil. But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility, the nature of evil and its meanness, and also the nature of the culprit himself, who is my brother (not in the physical sense, but as a fellow creature similarly endowed with reason and a share of the divine); therefore none of those things can injure me, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading. Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together, like a mans two hands, feet or eyelids, or the upper and lower rows of his teeth. To obstruct each other is against Natures law  and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction.

<TEXT>     The end of the world cannot be reached by traveling.
    Yet, without coming to the end of the world,
    there's no release from unpleasantness.
    Therefore be wise, know the nature of the world.
    Lead the holy life to the end of the world.
    The appeased, know the end of the world.
    And do not wish for, this or the other world.
