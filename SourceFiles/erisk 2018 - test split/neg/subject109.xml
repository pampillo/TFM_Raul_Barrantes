<TEXT> It's called flex time.  Some people take no time off and you have to basically tell them to.  Some people abuse it but they get bad raises or no bonus.  For most normal people, it works out fine.  I would say on average people take less time then when they had a fixed amount every year.  Keep in mind that 5 weeks is typical for someone in their 40s and younger folks get about two to start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure but it is from memory but I am sure someone will correct my mistakes.  Let's see....the earth is 160 million meters in diameter.  Let's assume he keeps a constant velocity  so we can ignore acceleration.

His velocity is distance over time so 160 million meters divided by 2 seconds.  So his velocity is 80 million m/s.

His kinetic energy is 0.5mv^2 and we'll assume he is 100 kg so his kenetic energy is 320,000, 000 Gigajoules.

That's  roughly 78 megatons of TNT or 5200 Hiroshima nukes per punch.  I think they underestimated the collateral damage of each of those punches. </TEXT>
