<TITLE> Get the fuck out of my house </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-01 05:48:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, a little backstory first. My sister in law and her son moved into my house last July, because her husband decided he didn't want to be married. I offered her to move in because living with her parents would be incredibly toxic for her and her son. Her new boyfriend recently moved in because he was going to rent a room from someone and they want to move out together. (There's more to it, but doesn't really matter)he's already here all the time, so I figured "meh, just move in here". We can at least make some money off of his presence. He works swing shift (3pm-1230am) so he's not ever really home when I am anyway. 

This rant is mostly about my sister in law. I'll start off by saying she is my best friend, but a huge pain in my ass. First off, I was gone for 6 months on deployment. The whole time I hear nothing but how my husband is a slob, he's lazy..blah blah. It's not entirely false, but she also tried to blame everything wrong with the house on him. I get home a few weeks ago and my house is outwardly clean. 

I open the fridge, and take absolutely covered in all kinds of random shit. My microwave is filthy. I have the refold and reorganize my linen closet because she "doesn't like to fold blankets". There's stains all over my carpet from her kid. There's a pile of dryer lint next to the dryer that she was too lazy to walk 5 feet to the trash can. The washer was covered in dirt and laundry detergent. My dog no longer eats any of her dog food because she's so accustomed to getting fed by my 2 1/2 year old nephew. 

My expensive knives and pots and pans were put in the dishwasher, even though I specifically asked for them to be hand washed. The motor in my carpet cleaner burned out because she hasn't figured out that you're supposed to vacuum before you use it. (I posted a pic on /r/wtf if you wanna see just how bad it was). 

Basically the only thing she gives her kid is milk. Constantly. He asks for milk and he gets it. He gets milk when he goes to bed, chugs it, screams for more, and gets it. This goes on several times throughout the night. I bought three gallons of milk last week and they didn't even last 5 days. She's moderately good at disciplining him, but doesn't do it over things I really think she should. I can't tell her how to raise her kid, so that's kind of a moot point. She always asks my husband or me to watch her son when she goes to the store because "he'll see a toy and then scream until he gets it". Hmm, maybe if you didn't give in so often it wouldn't be an issue. There are so many things that she complains her kid does when a majority of it is because she never put a stop to it. 

Her boyfriends shit takes up half my garage, but that's basically it. He does sometimes notice that my husband isn't doing something right( project wise) but runs to one of us to tell us instead of telling him directly. "It's a man thing"

She is so terrible at keeping house. Maybe I'm a clean freak and a control freak, but Jesus Christ. I've been back for 2 weeks after being gone for 6 months and I've hardly sat down since I've been home! I do not want them to rush into finding a place (they're looking, just not much in their price range. Yay California) but they need to get the fuck out. My husband and I want to start a family and that's definitely not possible while they're here. Get out and ruin your own things. 

Also, don't fucking complain about getting fat if you're going to eat fast food 3 times a day. Don't fucking tell me my method of dieting (keto) doesn't work when I lost 20lbs.

<TITLE> The mysterious disappearing lip ring... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-24 23:07:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey there! 

I've had my lip pierced for just under a year. Just about an hour ago, after I finished eating, my lip ring fell out. I managed the find the ball between my legs in my chair, but the post is no where to be found. I'm pretty sure I swallowed it...so I guess I could TECHNICALLY get it back..but ya know...gross.

Anyway, I'm currently in the Middle East on deployment and will be home in the states in about 2 weeks. I'm more than positive shipping a lip ring out here would not get here before I leave. I do not have anything that I can place in as a retainer. 

What are the possibilities of this closing in 2 weeks? Can I slow the process by sticking a clean earring/nose ring in it every couple hours? If it does close, are there any issues with repiercing the same spot? Not really freaking out, just love my lip piercing :/ 

Thanks in advance for the answers :D </TEXT>

<TITLE> SoCal Discount ID question </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there!

I recently purchased 4 SoCal $149 3-day one park per day tickets. My friend will be purchasing 2, one for his sister, one for himself.

According to the Disneyland Website, a person May purchase up to 5 tickets per person per day with valid ID. I am curious if my ID will be good enough for the 4 tickets I purchased, and my friend's ID will be good for his 2 tickets. 3 of the 4 people in my group have SoCal ID's, but one does not (even though we all live there, so she could bring a bill or something). My friend is a SoCal Resident, but his sister is coming in from out of state. 

I would really appreciate some insight here. Just in case it wasn't clear, I used my credit card and address for the 4 tickets. My friend will be using his as well for his 2.

Thanks in advance!

<TITLE> Almost 2 month plateau </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-09 01:18:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey There~

I'll start out with my stats: 23 F SW:190 CW:178 GW:160. I have been consistently working out for 4 months, 6 days a week. I stick to a Keto-ish diet (I do like potatoes every once in a while, ha!). I do not track my food any more, because I'm deployed and I have no clue what is in my food, at all. (i.e meatloaf in sauce that's probably made of nothing but sugar). I do my best to have small portions (successfully), and avoid carbs. I may be +/- on my calories, but I'm definitely burning a good bit in the gym. I don't touch soda, even when I'm not dieting, and I typically don't like sugar anyway. Because of my work shift and the available meal times, I eat at 1130pm and 730am. So I've got quite a bit of fasting going on in there.

Having worked out for 4 months (lifting and cardio), I have only lost 12 pounds. I lost those 12 pounds in the first 2 months, and I have been stalled since then. I have of course been increasing my weights for my lifting, as much as I can. This in itself is a struggle because I do not have a wide variety of dumbbells available. They start at 5kg, then move to 10kg so on and so forth. It makes it difficult to actually change my weight since the next step up is often too heavy. I typically do more reps with the light weight, or do as many reps as I can with the heavy weight, then finish the set with the other weight. 

I don't know if this helps any, but I carry almost all my weight in my stomach. Throughout my work out program, my legs and arms have toned up significantly. My problem area is the belly! My weight trends in the past few years have stayed pretty consistent. I usually hang out between 175-185. 190 is my highest. I have been on the birth control pill for many of those years. Is it possible my birth control is hindering my weight loss? What can I do? HALP ! </TEXT>

I know it seems silly, but I feel down for a day or so after watching it. Not even because of the "plot twist" at the ending, but the amount of emotion conveyed throughout the whole movie. Definitely a chick flick, but so goood!

<TITLE> Can I claim my sister in law on my taxes? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-07 03:13:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, PF!

I'm getting a jump start on my taxes with Turbo-Tax. It is asking if I have a child or support someone else. In it's help window, it defines support:

"Whether it's a child, a friend or a relative you support, the term 'support' is generally defined as what you spend on a person to provide the basic necessities of life. While the specifics may be debatable in certain circles, here's what the IRS considers typical for the purposes of a tax return. 

Support includes:
 *  Food 
 *  Lodging (even if your mortgage is paid off)  
 *  Clothing
 *  Education (including the GI bill)
 *  Medical and dental care (including insurance and supplementary Medicare premiums)
 *  Recreation
 *  Transportation and similar necessities"

I am technically doing almost all of this for my husband's sister and her son. While the simple answer should probably be yes, I've hit a bit of a wall. She is still married to her husband (soon to be ex, if he ever files). Can I still add her as someone I support if she's married? I'm curious if I do add her, if it will cause some issues with their taxes. She didn't start her job until Nov. 1 which is kind of irrelevant, since she only makes about $1000 a month.

Could really appreciate some insight here!
thanks :)

<TEXT> I've been doing keto for almost 5 weeks. I'm struggling a lot. Not so much with not eating particular things, but with the options I have. I'm deployed overseas to a relatively new location, so we don't get a lot of options for chow. I grab what I assume doesn't have a lot of carbs, and then find out it has waaaaay more than I'd like. I can barely meet my calorie goals because of so few choices. 

I'm working out 6 days a week. I've lost 5lbs since I started all this. I'm going to assume I'm not losing because I'm gaining muscle in the process. I'm feeling very discouraged, like I should stop keto until I get home and can actually choose my food. I've felt so great since I stopped eating so many carbs, but I know as soon as I just "watch" my carbs, I'll be eating the whole dessert table. </TEXT>

I don't have access to coconut oil, and ordering it would probably get it here by the time I leave,lol. We done have actual butter here, just shitty margarine, I think, haven't actually looked. No avacados. We have nuts that are unbearably salty, but I could rinse them, I guess. I think just adding an oz of nuts would get my cal count up </TEXT>

<TITLE> Keto thus far </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-11 21:03:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello!

I've been doing keto for about 3 weeks now. I think I've lost 2lbs. I'm working out (lifting) a little as well, so maybe that's why I'm not losing.  My husband says my stomach looks smaller(pics). I'm currently deployed, so keto is actually pretty easy with the limited choices. I've stopped tracking my food, since I'm typically eating the same things everyday.

I find that I'm not hungry nearly as often as i used to be. I also find that when I do eat, it makes me kind of nauseous. It quickly goes away, but it's odd. I am coming concerned that I'm not eating enough. When I last tracked my food, it had me at only 900cals. I should be eating 1200 to lose. My issue is that I'm just not hungry! 

I've also noticed that when I have to pee, there isn't much warning, I just realize "shit, I need to pee". I definitely have the keto pee stank. It's harder and harder for me to stay hydrated. Keto also managed to start my period. Which totally sucks, because I'm on BC and just had my period a week and a half ago. 

Overall, I feel alright, a little discouraged due to almost no weight loss, not even the large amount of water weight most people lose. I plan to stick with it a little longer, but shit, I want a waffle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a problem! I find that being aggressive doesn't really accomplish anything.

I get your thinking on the taxes thing. However, if you consider that a majority of low income individuals can't afford BC, it is also fair to say that those same low income individuals are going to end up on government assistance. Even if they choose to give the child up for adoption, that child is stilling going to be living off the system. It's a vicious cycle that doesn't have any true solution. Free BC would help alot of women, like myself, who have conditions that require oral contraceptive to balance hormones and such. Also, there are many men and women who know for a fact, without a doubt, that they do not want children. The obvious answer is for them to get sterilized, but most doctors will not do sterilization procedures until certain things have been met. Age and mental state are a huge factor in this. I feel there are more positive reasons to have free BC than there are negatives.

<TEXT> I believe that gestation limits need to change. While 20 weeks is technically a decent amount of time, it doesn't account for error. Typically, a woman can find out at her 20 week ultrasound whether or not her fetus is viable. But, the 20 week ultrasound doesn't always happen at 20 weeks. So, if I go at 21 weeks and find out my baby isn't going to survive, most laws say that it would be illegal for me to terminate. That being said, some insurance companies will list that abortion as "elective surgery", even though it could be life or death for the mother.

Along with that, waiting periods and counseling. Enforcing a waiting period to get an abortion makes it that much harder to get one. Who  has 3-5 days to take care of a 30 minute procedure? Enforcing Counseling prior to the procedure could actually be very traumatizing. It could sway a woman to not go through with the abortion, which might be considered a good thing, until she regrets having that child. Which would then lead to possible child abuse and neglect.

The government shouldn't have as much rule over this as they do. What I do with my body should be none of their business. While I understand that most people view abortion as murder, I view child abuse and neglect just as bad, if not worse. The general consensus is " You don't want to get pregnant? Don't have sex". But there are so many reasons why that is completely off base. I am a married woman, who is on birth control, and my husband pulls out. It is quite obvious that I am not wanting to get pregnant. Sure, we could NOT have sex, but as humans, we are biologically wired to crave intimacy. Plus, not consumating can be detrimental to a marriage. Should I be forced to have that child? I don't think so. I shouldn't be foreced to carry that child to term, just to give it up for adoption either. My stepsister gave her daughter up for adoption, and I see the pain she endures everyday. 

In my opinion, birth control should be 100% free, no questions asked. You should be able to walk into a clinic at anytime, talk with a doctor, discuss BC options, and walk out with a prescription/IUD/shot, that day. Women's healthcare (gynecological care) and  men's healthcare (prostate, reproductive issues) should all be free. 

I could go on and on all day long. I've already gone far beyond what you've asked, but this is just the gist lol. </TEXT>

My senior year, I was in what was technically Alegebra 3. I almost failed the first semester, due to just not understanding a fucking thing. I ended up getting moved into "Liberal Arts Math". This class was literally ESSENTIAL to my financial success. We spent 9 weeks just on FINANCIAL PLANNING. I am 23, a homeowner, and I have minimal debt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My husband and I dated for 9 months during Senior year. We broke up for 3 years, reconnected and got married 2 months later. Been married 2.5 years now.

On the flip side, my sister in law(23) and her (soon to be ex) husband have been together since they were 16 or so. In the past few months, he's decided he doesn't want to be married anymore, because he feels too tied down.

My sister and her husband have been together since they were 15, and are now 35, I believe. That's not to say they haven't had their issues, but they seem pretty stable. </TEXT>

First ACTUAL fight:
I was 14 I think. This girl had been teasing and making fun of me ALL day. I went to a teacher and was told to ignore it. There's only so much ignoring one can do. Finally, it was the end of the day and I was walking to my bus. This girl and her friends were standing by the door pointing and laughing at me. At that point, I had had it. I walk up to her, punch her square in the mouth. I back up to get another shot and trip over my friend who is right behind me. 

I'd say I won, since she never actually touched me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there pf!

I'm writing today because I'm in a bit of a pickle. I live in California, and about a month ago, I purchased a 2002 PT Cruiser from a coworker for $1400.Runs like a champ! The only issue is that she had to file for a lost title, because her house was broken into a few months back, and that was one of the stolen items.

I've been driving it for the past month with no registration, since I have a month to register. I still do not have a title. I contacted coworker and she still has not heard anything, after being told initially it would only take 3 weeks. I will be heading overseas in about 3 weeks. The car is in my name. If I do not register it before I leave, I'll have a $1400 paperweight in my driveway. Is there anyway my husband can register the car in my name? Does power of attorney give him the right to do so?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I told my SIL if she was going to wear a skirt, she needs to wear pantyhose. She wore a skirt with no hose. Told her that flats aren't typically professional, so she should wear pumps. She wore flats.

Its a good thing she's only going for minimum wage jobs, because she's definitely not dressing for the job she wants. </TEXT>

My SIL went to a job fair last week. I printed out 10 copies of her resume for her to take and pass out. She took ONE. Fortunately, the one she took ended up with her getting an interview for later this week. But I believe she really could have gotten more opportunities had she actually passed out more.

<TEXT> I'm considering this for my sister in law. She needs quite a bit of work, after not having gone to the dentist since 16 (she's 23). She needs her wisdom teeth removed, as they are cracking her molars, a root canal and crown on one of said molars, many small cavities filled, and some stain removal. She recently had 3 crowns done and that maxed out her insurance and cost me $1600 in copays </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, my dentist told me that most of the work the Air Force did for me is probably going to have to be redone at some point. I don't think he's trying to make money off of me, since he's not really pushing the issue at the moment.

If you get married and get your spouse the dental insurance,  good luck with that one. The current plan only covers $1300 of work and the copays are astronimical. My husband maxed his coverage out in 2 visits for 5 cavities, with about $400 in copays. Sister in law maxed it out in one visit for 3 crowns, with $1600 copay. 

When I got my wisdom teeth out, I had to get them surgically removed, so I got sent to a specialist. Many people I know have lasting issues from the military stealing their wisdom teeth, so I lucked out on that one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long story short, my sister in law has been a stay at home for a while (mostly due to a jealous and controlling husband), and is now looking to start working again. It was quite obvious that she didn't know how to write a resume. I cringed when I looked over it, honestly. I did my best to re-write her resume and cover letter. 

I was wondering if you guys could take a look and give me some criticism. My resume skills are sub-par, so be gentle. The jobs she is applying for is a food service position at my company, so I'm hoping I'll be able to pull some strings any way. Thanks in advance!

There have been several instances where he should have gotten in trouble , and did not. Also, I've heard that basically every married guy in that unit is cheating on their spouse. I'm tempted to tell her to try anyway </TEXT>

<TEXT> She was planning on going to JAG tomorrow for some advice. We are also aware of the cheating being illegal. She initially had no desire to get him in trouble with the military, because that would be taking things from her son. From what I've heard, his unit won't do anything about it anyway. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [KY] Husband refusing money to his wife (Military) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-14 20:04:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there! Quick backstory here. My sister in law, Jo, recently came to CA to live with me and her brother, along with her son. Her husband Don, is stationed in Ft. Campbell, KY. Jo left  (more like he kicked her and son out) Don a little over a month ago, due to his cheating and unwillingness to work towards a fix. 

Jo has not yet found a job, due to unavailable jobs and her vehicle being broken. But, she has started college through the military spouse assistance. In the past month, Don has been paid twice and has easily sent her $400 each time. Fast forward to this past paycheck, (Friday-ish) Don does not pay Jo. Jo doesn't want to ask him because she is not speaking to him due to his nasty attitude. 

Jo still has access to the joint account, so she went in and transferred the money herself. She sent Don a courtesy text, saying that she transferred the money because she needs money to provide for their son. He comes back with shit like "I'm the one providing, you're just buying him shit." or "that's not your money to take". 

I understand Don's perspective, but since they are still married, does he have any right to tell her she can't feed her son? This morning Jo woke up to a text that Don was going to remove her access to all the bank accounts, because she used money from another account. My question is, can he do that? Especially with him being military, can he refuse her money/access to the bank accounts?

Just remembered that he is threatening to kick her off the car insurance as well. Wouldn't be surprised if he's threatened the medical as well. 

This whole situation is a cluster fuck, and there are a million more questions I have, but this is just the most pressing item at the time.

Thanks for any advice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi /r/legaladvice!

Bit of an odd situation right now. My Sister in Law just left her DBH(douchebag husband) and moved to California with her brother and I. When I say she left, he more or less kicked her out.

DBH is in the Army, stationed at Fort Campbell, KY/TN.  SIL just moved to Palmdale, CA. They were married for almost 4 years (Florida license). 

DBH cheated several times over the past few years. Ranging from simple conversation to sex. SIL has been very clear that she wants to work on the marriage. DBH has made it very clear that he is done with her and she is not welcome to her home (base housing at Ft Campbell). SIL wanted to make arrangements to stay because she also has his almost 2 year old son. (something like him stay in the barracks and she can stay in the house) But he did not want that. She wanted to file for legal separation so he would still have to provide for her while she got back on her feet. He did not want to do that either.

So now she is in Cali with me and her brother along with her son. DBH says he will be filing for divorce in a matter of days. He says he will be filing no fault or something to close it. He insists that she agrees to all his terms and does not get a lawyer. Well, we aren't that dumb.

What we need advice on is how and where and who to file with. If we manage to beat him to filing, is it possible to file out of state? We know she can't file in Cali because she hasn't been living her long enough. She wants to nail his ass to the wall. Child support alimony, etc. She can't really report him to his chain of command about the situation because they already know its happening and are only on his side. Plus, getting him in trouble will take money away from their son. Does anyone have an idea of where to find a good, cheap, lawyer in High desert area? We want this to be quick and painless.  If you need more details, I will add them as they are asked for. Thanks in advance!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there /r/ Trucks!

I apologize if this isn't a good place to post. Please direct me to the right place if its not. :)

I was wondering if there are any rental truck companies that will allow you to tow a trailer with their truck. I need to move my sister in law from Kentucky to California. A U-Haul moving truck is not an option because she has her son. We do not think her Jeep will make the trip, so we are exploring other options. Our current plan is to use the Jeep to haul a trailer with her things. If we can't get her Jeep into a driveable condition, I was wanting to rent a truck.

Do you guys know of any place that will allow this? Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The argument that I've heard about this (which I do not agree with AT ALL), is  "Why should your employer have to pay you because you decided to have a baby? Why is that their responsibility?" 

People want to sit here and complain about California taxes, but part of that is FMLA. If a family member gets sick, I can take time off and still get paid. If I adpot a child, I can take time off and still get paid. I can give birth, take time off and still get paid.

I also find it odd that in order to LEGALLY sell a puppy/kitten, it has to be at least 8 weeks old. US law doesn't require 8 weeks of maternity leave for a human mother and child. Ain't life grand? </TEXT>

But that would still leave her vehicle across the country, unless they tow it. She's also afraid to fly (she never has) and she's worried she won't be able to handle that with her son. I've considered taking some time off work to fly out there and help. I think when I moved across the country, a 10ft truck with a tow was about $1600, so that might be the best option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, I'll try and keep this short and sweet. My sister in law is going to be leaving her husband. Their current home is in Fort Campbell, KY. She will be moving into my home with her 1 1/2 year old son. We live in Palmdale,CA. 

We are trying to figure out how to get her stuff from point A to point B. I've looked at a few companies and it looks as though its going to be extremely expensive. This is for pack and ship companies.

The next option is for her to drive with her son and mom, while her dad drives a Uhaul. This might be the most cost effective option, but her current vehicle isn't in the best shape, so we aren't sure it could make the trek out here. Towing isn't really an option because of her son.

Do you guys have any advice as to what our options are? She's going through a rough time and we are trying to make it as painless as possible. Please and thank you :) </TEXT>

Sure as shit,  I come home from work today and my husband informs me that she was infact pregnant and had babies today! We were slightly unprepared for this lol.

Is there anything we should look out for? We have the two females in the same cage. ...Do I have to worry about her eating her babies? Are there any things we should get to make them all more comfortable?
Thanks in advance :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did this the other day with lemon/lime juice. I freeze the juice in ice trays and add a few cubes to my water, instead of having to cut up another fruit. I find that it does dull the flavor a tad bit, but I just use it for flavoring water, so it's not that big of a deal to me. If I actually need juice for a recipe, I'll just juice a fresh one :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That its fucking retarded to have a $35k wedding. Starting your marriage with a slice of debt like that is not smart. Buy a car. Down payment on a house. Even if a side of the family will be paying, don't do it. They'll always have something to hold over your head. 

Wait a few years before you have kids. A lot of people don't seem to understand that when you get married, things do change. It takes a few years to fully notice these things. 

Divorce is not the worst thing in the world. If you don't Iove each other anymore, don't stay together. Be civil and go your separate ways. Move on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *puts on tinfoil hat* 

okay, so, as it's been said before, trump has been friends with th clintons for a loooong time. Word in the street is that he had a very long phone call with Bill Clinton about a month before he announced he was running. My theory is that try came up with "make the GOP look as crazy as possible. Shake the system. Make them vote for you. Tell them what they want to hear. When it comes to the general and you're up against hillary, drop out. Secure the White House for her." This also plays into trump identifying as a democrat most of his life. 

It might be a stretch, but it seems plausible at the same time. I don't think they thought people would get behind him in the way that they are. I don't think they counted in Bernie either lol </TEXT>

EDIT: Yes, you all have a right to protest. There's a difference between standing across the street with signs and actually being inside. Even if you don't support Trump, his supporters have every right to be there to here them speak.

I fully understand what Black Lives Matter is portraying. I'm also getting tired of hearing about them interrupting rallies, charging stages, and getting violent. That, to me, is feeding into the problem.  Go ahead, downvote me for having a different opinion.

<TEXT> I think I would go Trump.

He scares me sometimes, but I'm pretty convinced he is just saying what people want to hear, and honestly, what other people wish they could say out loud. I've also been told he's been a democrat his whole life, and then decided to run Republican? Hmm..

Right now I think people are voting for him as a JOKE, because he is saying these things. Hopefully they wise up and realize he isn't the best choice.

Also, the voting process itself is pretty stupid. The whole open/closed/semi-closed thing is confusing, especially to people who have never voted. I find it ridiculous that there is a timeline for affiliation as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are a Facebook user or user of any other social media, please, for the love of Bernie, CALL PEOPLE OUT FOR POSTING FALSE/MISLEADING INFORMATION!!

I have seen a lot of my Facebook friends share things about presidential candidates that aren't necessarily true. Please correct them. Nicely, of course. Provide a link disproving their information. 

I'm tired of Bernie supporters getting called stupid. Don't be the reason. 

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mostly because I associate butt holes with shit, naturally. I shouldn't have to do any kind of preparation for sex. I shouldn't have to take a laxative, or an enema. 

When I see it in porn, it doesn't look right. It doesn't look comfortable. Unnatural, might be the right word. 

Plus, there was something at the top of /r/wtf about a week ago that didn't really ease my fears lol.

<TITLE> [anal] Husband wants anal and I don't </TITLE>

<TEXT> Title stays it all. 

I have absolutely no desire to have anything in my ass. Not fingers. Not toys. Not dicks. If I'm watching porn and anal pops up, I immediately close that video and find another one. It actually makes me cringe. 

My husband really wants to do anal with me. He says he'll be gentle and slow, work his way up... I don't fucking care! He brings it up all the time and I constantly tell him no. 

I've talked to a few people about it and they say(as well as my husband) "if you've never tried it, how do you know you won't like it?" Does the fact that it makes me shiver and want to gag not mean a thing?

I'm kind of just ranting here, but I don't know how to handle this anymore. We've been married for 2 years and this has been the subject of many of our fights. I don't know how many other ways to say no.

TL:DR husband wants anal and I don't.  </TEXT>

I lived in the Bible Belt in Georgia when I was a teenager and they actually gave a pretty good sex Ed class. They thought about contraception, abstinence, condoms, horrible std pictures. They called it "life choices" or something. Either way, it was good and it gave my enough information to want to look up more.  Didn't get pregnant in high school.

<TEXT> I agree with what you listed as relatively harmless. As far as the other drugs, I agree they're harmful. I think they should still be legalized. 

I've heard in Amsterdam, you have a daily allowance of marijuana you're allowed. They monitor it by inputting you in a system. Apparently this list is accessible by potential employers with background checks. It would make sense to do the same thing with the harder drugs. People are going to do it regardless. If it was monitored somehow, it could be regulated better. Employers wouldn't end up hiring an addict and then be surprised one day when they don't show up or lose their shit. 

I don't know if the Amsterdam thing is true or not. I feel like I've heard it before but idk lol </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-02-08 11:28:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys!

I'm making this post because a lot of conversations have come up recently, and I can't get them out of my mind. I'm a hard core Bernie supporter, so naturally I like to discuss him with people.

Anyway, first things first. I had a coworker who is very antigovernment mention that, technically, because Bernie is calling this a "political revolution" he is basically condoning communism. I can't personally see that, based in the research I've done. Dude says he wishes he could vote for Bernie because he believes in a lot of his policies, but the "communist" thing prevents him from that. Could things be going differently had he not used the word "socialist"? Would we look at him differently?

There was another coworker who was very pro-death penalty. I personally don't care. I did mention that it costs more for a death penalty inmate than it does for a life sentence inmate. However, this is based on court cases and appeals. His response to cases was "they need to stop the court cases then, just kill the bastard". I explained that that is in place because of our constitutional right to fair trial, due process, and all that jazz. The subject of how we identify came up. I said I don't identify with either of the parties. I just do what feels right. He said " I consider myself a constitutionalist" my response? "You mean you believe in a country for the people, by the people?" He answered yes. Did he not just contradict himself based on his death penalty statement?

I've run my own numbers with www.bernietax.com and would probably save like $4k a year. I've also been spreading this around Facebook so people who are scared of taxes understand.  Anyway, I firmly believe in healthcare for all. What I'm curious about is how this would be implemented. Basically, we wake up one day and be able to go to the doctor? Would all private insurance go away? I have to go to the doctor/dentist periodically for work and if I have to wait a long time to get in, that would be very inconvenient.

I've heard a lot of propaganda regarding Bernies plans that say we would be put into deeper debt. Have we actually had a non biased source run his numbers? Would his proposed plans ACTUALLY pay for themselves? Do any of his plans show a decrease in the national debt?

I've tried to do a lot of my own research to keep people informed. I can't phone bank or canvas right now, so I've taken to social media to convince people. Pretty good result right now, so long as I message them directly and ease into the conversation. 

Guys, my mind is completely overrun with politics to the point where I can't sleep because I'm thinking about it so much. I get emotional when I see Bernie videos. I have more passion about Bernie than I've ever had about anything in my life. If I'm not actively working, I'm trying to find out more about Bernie. I get upset when I hear people don't like him because he wants to help other people. My heart aches when someone tells me they want to vote for hillary.

That's the biggest thing I hear. "Do you really want the government in charge of something like this?"
"Look at Canada and how long their wait times are."
"I shouldn't have to pay for something i might not ever use." "He's a socialist."

<TEXT> I'm actually surprised to hear this. I've been with them for almost a year now and haven't had any issues. I didn't really have a choice but to go with then since AT T offered 3 Mbps for $50. (lulz). Time warner was like $60 for the 100mbps. 

Theyve been great and haven't given me any reason to not like them. Sorry for your luck op  </TEXT>

A huge trend I have noticed is that people really have NO idea how taxes work. Please share this to educate people.

It would be silly for people to be against Bernie because they think they're going to get taxed out the wazoo :)

<TEXT> This is where I think he fell really short and it kind of set the tone for the remainder of the debate for me. He knows his views, but because he almost *NEVER* talks about them. This is actually a huge deal for a lot of people.

While the war on banks and Wallstreet is important, it is not the most pressing issue at this time. ISIS is a massive threat. ISIS isn't just pulling shit in the States, ISIS is pulling shit in the countries of our ALLIES. Something needs to be done, and something needs to be done soon.

I agree with what he wants, 100%. These other countries that we've helped over the years should be the ones to lead this. We should be there for support. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys. 

I was basically attacked on a Facebook group that supports BERNIE~ I joined it yesterday and have been very active about posting information on voting, livestreams for dem hall, dem debate...etc. 

During the debate, I pointed out that he was a little weak on his delivery for FP. Holy shit did I get attacked. I was accused of being a troll! I don't understand how pointing out a weakness is trolling. If it were on an open group, maybe that could be seen as bad, but this was a group of supporters.

I countered them with something that  basically shut them up. I actually think this should be a lesson for ALL of us.

I told them that we can't sit here and bash Hillary supporters because they don't see what wrong with her, if we arent even willing to acknowledge an issue with our OWN candidate. I'm not saying be a bunch of negative nancies, but we can't sit here in delusion thinking the sun shines out of his ass.

We need to be able to identify an issue so that we can fight it ourselves! I do not support Bernie any less than I did before. So please guys, don't call people trolls for simply(and respectfully)  pointing out an issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've listened to many perspectives on this and they're all pretty similar. Personally, I can't speak to "innocent" civilians. Yes, there are some situations where there is collateral damage. Someone might get taken out. And yes there are "guilty by association". 

What needs to be realized is that even if we used just HUMINT sources, we could still end up with unnecessary casualties. The way I see it, and maybe I'm bias because this is my job, is that because of this program, manned assets don't have to fly in hostile areas. We can actually get good ISR data before sending dudes in there.  Getting a "drone" out there is significantly cheaper, safer, and productive. 

I hate that there is unnecessary death, but it is a product of evil and war. I think of the lives we do save by utilizing this program.  </TEXT>

Personal view: if debt free college is what I think it is, (i.e affordable) i think that would sit better with people over FREE college. Honestly, when that gets brought up in discussions, that's a huge complaint. 

I understand where the money will be coming from and it doesn't bother ME, but I find people getting upset because they see it as being taxed/punished for being wealthy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I first moved into my new house, I invited my neighbors across the street over for a bbq. They were around mine and my husbands age, so we figured why not. 

I told them 2 weeks in advance, and asked if they were coming 3 days prior. Both answers were yes. Day of I was walking the dog and spotted dude outside. Asked him if he was coming, and he was like "yeah, yeah! Well be there later!" 

Eventually it was like, 430pm and we hadn't seen them, so I popped back over there for this clown to tell me his wife made other plans.

I feel like they didn't want to go in the first place, which is 100% fine, but no is a better answer than dancing around the subject. I was more pissed that we had waited so long for an answer. That by the time we got the ribs on the grill, it was dark as fuck.

<TITLE> My experience with the patches </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-27 10:01:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! I just wanted to share my experience with nicotine patches!

For starters, I'm not even counting the days, because I feel like it will impede my process a little bit. I started with the 21mg patch probably a week ago. I think I'm about halfway through my first box. 

When I first put it on, that first day, I allowed myself to smoke whenever I wanted. I smoked 3. I was like, okay, tomorrow I'm going to smoke one less. So, the next day I smoked 2, next day 1, and then down to none.

After I got to not smoking at all, I would put the patch on as soon as I finished breakfast, which was my normal first cigarette of the day. After 2 days of doing that, I started trying to put the patch on  later and later each day, so I would be getting less nicotine throughout the day. Also, I take the patch off at night, since I don't usually get in during sleep time anyway. (the first couple of nights I left it on and it caused me to constantly wake up through the night).

Like I said, I'm not exactly sure what day I'm on at this point, but when I put a patch on now, I actually get a slight nicotine buzz. I know that I'm supposed to stay on the 21 mg for like, 6 weeks, but I feel that because I'm doing so well with them now, I would skip straight to the 14mg, doing the same thing I am now, and then eventually to the 7mg, down to none.

I really feel like this is going to work. My husband is also working on quitting. (I'm deployed right now, so he's doing his own thing at this point). I'm actually trying to convince my dad to try quitting as well! 

If anyone has an input on my plan, or can share their own stories, that'll be awesome!! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why am I sleeping so much? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-12 17:48:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys!

I have been deployed for about 2 1/2 weeks now. Since then, whenever I got to take a "nap" for around 30-45 minutes, I sleep for HOURS.  For example, toady, around 4pm I set an alarm for 4:45 and didn't wake up until 7:00pm. I know it doesn't seem like much, but I go to bed around 8:30 or 930 and wake up at 430 am. I struggle to wake up. Whenever I finally get out of bed I'm fine. We'll go to breakfast and then go to work. 

By the time I get to work,  it takes about 20 minutes for me to be completely exhausted again. Sometimes I'm able to sneak in a nap, and i feel pretty good for a few hours, but by the time I get back to my room, around 1 or 2 pm, I'm completely exhausted again!

I've been making slight changes to my diet and lifestyle, but I don't feel like any of them are drastic enough for this much sleeping. I have begun working out, but not too hard I don't think. A little sore the next day, but nothing like what I've felt before.

Food wise, breakfast is almost always the same, an omelet with hash browns, side of fruit. I don't often get to eat lunch and lately I've been sleeping through dinner and my workout! But when I do eat, I try to keep it small and simple, salad with chicken side of veggies. The chow hall here is kinda crappy, so that's basically all I can eat.

I've also started the attempt to quit smoking. I'm wearing the patch. However, I feel this is irrelevant since my sleeping was an issue before.

Just wanted to get some input guys!

<TEXT> Hey guys!

After watching a few MMA fights, I have to say, I'm really interested in AT LEAST learning how to fight. It looks like an incredible work out, and it gives me a chance to learn how to whoop some ass, should I need it.

I would very much like to start MMA-style training. I'm about to deploy for 3 months, so I'll have access to a great gym. However, I probably won't have access to any martial arts classes.

What are the best workouts to condition myself to get into kickboxing? I'm currently 5'5 and about 190lbs, so I'm overweight to say the least. (I don't look it, thank goodness)

In the midst of this conditioning, I'm also wanting to cut about 30 or so pounds. I'm already aware of dieting, and I'll be able to stick to it on deployment since chicken and vegetables is probably the only safe thing lol

I appreciate any input! Don't hate on me for being a fatty ;_; </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pay off debts or save it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-15 18:35:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey PF!

I recently withdrew my Roth TSP that I had through the military. I separated, so I am no longer able to add to it. I have an IRA through my job now, so I still have something.

The withdrawal handed me about $2300. I know that doesn't seem like much, but I feel like it is in my situation. I understand that early withdrawal gets you taxed ~20%...I'm assuming that gets applied at the end of the year, since I got the full amount deposited into my account.

I'm curious if I should put this into savings or pay off my debt. Here's a break down of my debts:

Car Payment: $109.43 per month 3.1% int. debt total:$ 3651.02

Capitol One Quicksilver: Balance:$1650.90 0% int until Dec. After that, 22% APR

Sears Credit Card: Balance: $1215.38 0% int. until April 2016 ( no idea what it will be after that)

I also have a mortgage, but first payment isn't due until December.

I make ~$1600 every 2 weeks (~$3200 per month). You should also know that I will be deploying with my company in the next month or so. From what I have been told, my pay will basically double each month. So, realistically, my debts will be paid off in the next few months no matter what.

Any advice for me PF? thanks in advance :D  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Balance Transfer on Credit Card </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-12 16:31:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey PF!

I currently have a Capitol One Quicksilver credit card that offers 1% cash back on every purchase. 22% APR (can someone explain APR? is that broken up throughout the year?) I initially signed up for it back in April and have no interest until December. The current balance is $1,377.39 credit limit is $5000. My balance is about to increase by approximately $300 for company travel. (they reimburse me,but it takes about a month or so to get it back)

Since December is fast approaching, I was talking to a coworker about it and he suggested I find a credit card that has a no-interest-introductory period, the perks I want, along with a balance transfer. Does anyone know of any credit cards like this? I like the cash back perks because I get advances from my company and I can reap some free money.

I have an alright credit score. 689 I think. (I also have a Sears credit card (no interest) with a balance) My score WAS 727 back in April, but I got the credit card for a move across the country, acquired a balance, got a ton of credit checks for my rental home and utilities. It took quite the hit, lol.

I also just purchased a house this past Friday (woot woot!) so my score might have changed again.

Just trying to figure out what I should do. Thanks in advance :)

<TEXT> I get a whole bunch of shit about the fact my husband doesn't work. I make enough money for us to live comfortably. I constantly hear the term "suga-momma". My husband does his part in other ways. He takes care of the house. He wakes up with me every morning at 3am to make my coffee and pack my lunch. If it were the other way around, it would be looked at as normal for me to stay at home. 

To be clear, my husband is going to start job hunting once we save up enough to get another car. We live 30-45 minutes away from everything, so sharing a car is just too many ch of a hassle at this point. I know all I have to do is tell people to shut up and mind their own, but damn. Do we really live in a society where it's not okay for the man to stay at home?

<TEXT> Hi, TwoX~

I've heard about menstrual cups the past few years. DivaCup,MoonCup, etc. I would be interested in trying one, but I don't know much about it!

I know you just pop it in and forget it, depending on your flow, then just rinse it out when it's full. Well, what if I'm in a public restroom without a private sink? How would I rinse it out? I feel like that would gross people out if I just did it out in the open like that, lol.

Anyway, you guys got any insight for me? Best brand? Do you pee with it in, like a tampon? Can it like...fall out? How is it with leakage? I already wear a pad with a tampon anyway, so I'm fine with wearing a pad. Just trying to educated guys :3 </TEXT>

<TITLE> Starting a VA Claim </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-21 17:37:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys! Thanks for your service!

Anywho, I separated about a year ago (Sept 29, 2014). In March of '14, while I was deployed, I started having issues with my left wrist, namely while doing pushups.(Felt like my wrist was going to give out under me, pains shooting up my arm). I couldn't even prop my head up on my left hand for long because it would start to hurt.

I went to the on-site flight doctor there, and they took an X-Ray, but said they couldn't see a problem and chocked it up to being carpal tunnel...doesn't make sense since I hardly ever use my left wrist...They gave my a wrist brace and some Naproxen.

When I got  back to the states, I went to the doctor and he did some movement assessments and said he didn't see any issues. Gave me Mobic and that was that. When I was beginning my separation process in June of '14, my supervisor suggested I file a claim (for anything, and everything). Personally, that didn't feel right to me, since I was technically fine, so I never filed.

Now, all of a sudden, I'm having flare-ups in my wrist. Usually it would only hurt if I put pressure on it, but lately just moving it, it kinda hurts.

What I want to know, is if I should go to my normal provider, bring it up with them, get X-rays, and whatever they suggest, and then start things with the VA? I want to make this as painless as possible (literally and figuratively). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there! posted this in /r/personalfinance and was told to come here!

I'm trying to find a real estate agent to help me appraise my house. I have NO idea how to go about finding an agent.

My landlord WANTS 185k for the house (his agent already told him that's not gonna happen. He thinks it's worth 154k) He showed us houses in the area, and that number doesn't quite sit with me. All the houses are going in the 130's range and are larger than mine, with more usable land.

I'm using my VA loan, so I know it will get appraised by them, but I want to have a 3rd number to go off of. I know I need an agent as well, who is going to fight for me. What is the BEST way to judge someone when searching? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Possibility of buying my house...should I? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-04 21:54:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got a phone call a few minutes ago from my landlord's real estate rep. He said that my LL is interested in selling the house.

 I met him last week after he came out to assess the house. I mentioned to him that I would be interested in buying this house, should it become available. 

From my research, my LL bought the house at 55k and it's worth 120kish. ( this is from zillow). I currently pay $1000 a month for rent. It's a 3 bed,  2 bath, big backyard and front yard. I will say it's not in the best area, but that doesn't concern hubby and I too much. If we buy and get a 15year loan, that would put our payments around $800 a month, right?

I am a veteran, so I am eligible for the VA loan.  I know with the VA loan that you do not have to put a down payment, but you pay closing costs. Can you bundle the closing costs with the actual loan?

I currently make $3200 a month. I have a Sears credit card with $1800 balance ( no interest right now) $1000 balance on my Capitol one ( no interest until Dec.) I owe $3800 on my car. Right now our saving is... Nonexistent. (We moved across the country less than 6 months ago, slowly recovering lol)
 
On top of that, I deploy for my job, which significantly increases my income while I'm there's. I will be deploying around mid-October and returning late February- early March. So I know my debt will be going up, but I can pay it off relatively fast.

If we don't buy, we have to move again and will still have no money and no house to call our own.

My questions are: is this something we should pursue?  

Edit: I want to include that the house was built in 1988 and is very structurally sound. We've not had an issues since we've lived here </TEXT>

The only common denominator at this point is the nicotine, but I'm fine with smoking cigarettes.  I've tried adjusting the watts and all the other doodads on my build, but I always end up with a closed throat. It also makes me have a productive cough for a few minutes after a hit. I'm trying to cut down on cigarettes and eventually quit. 

I forgot to add that I tried vaping about 2 years ago and I didn't have any reactions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I currently hate my vagina/reproductive system. I recently had a root canal and was given antibiotics to fend off infection. 

My tooth isn't infected, so that's good. My vagina on the other hand fucking hurts. I have a raging yeast infection. I've done my best to not touch it, but christ almighty it itches, inside and out. I knew when I finished my week-long dosage of Doxycycline that this could happen, but this might be the worst YI I've ever had. Symptoms started showing Friday afternoon-ish. I've taken 5 baking soda baths and drank some nasty ass apple cider vinegar. 

As great as antibiotics are because they can wreck the evil inside, sometimes it feels like they're doing more harm than good. It even renders my birth control useless-ish? Oddly enough, while I was actively taking the AB, my vagina was feeling awesome. I didn't have my normal lady odor and that was great lol. But as soon as I stopped taking 'em, it feels like death.

Okay, I'm done ranting. I do plan on calling my doctor today to try and get an appointment because this shit HURTS!! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Issues with Mom </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-19 02:00:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey TwoX! This is gonna be long, so prepare yourself lol

Just wanted to come here to get a little advice as to what I should do about the relationship with my mother. Don't get me wrong, we get along just fine, but I feel like my mom is the most self-centered and selfish person.

I lived with my dad and grandma for most of my life. When I turned 13 I lived with my mom until I moved out at 18 and joined the military. I've always been able to tell my mom everything and anything. However, during the majority of my teen years, my mom was married to a total crackhead. He was a nice enough person, but obviously the drugs caused all kinds of problems.

I was never allowed to be alone with my mom because he got jealous and worried that we were talking shit about him. Which, to be fair we were, but we had every reason to. He was verbally abusive to both of us and put a huge strain on our relationship. A couple of years ago, she finally divorced him. Yay, go mom. All that aside, I really think her marriage set the tone for the entire basis of OUR relationship.

I can pretty much gather from my sisters that my mom has always been kind of selfish, but I really feel like it's reached an all time high. From 2011-2014, I lived on the otherside of the country. She never once offered to visit me. I always had to go see her. I moved back to the East Coast in September of 2014 with my husband. ( I got out of the military) We lived with my in-laws until April. My mom lived 45 minutes away and didn't work. She didn't once come to see me. I always had to go see her. I always did because I didn't want to cause problems where they weren't necessary.

Adding into the whole "45 minutes away thing", I got married in May of 2014 while I was on leave. Our wedding was really last minute. WE wanted to get married at the pond where we had our first date. My mom basically said she wouldn't come because she would have to drive 45 minutes. So we had our wedding closer to her house. To be fair, my wedding turned out great, but the point is she tried to make it all about her. My husband's family had to drive 45 minutes. To add even more insult to injury, my in-laws invited her and her new husband over to their house SEVERAL times, and she made up and excuse not to come EVERY time.

Currently, I live in California, so I'm across the country again for my new job. My mom and her husband flew into Vegas today. My mom keeps going on and on about me going to see her. She's about 3 hours away. I want her to come see ME. I want her to see where I live. She got all upset that I couldn't take a day off to come see her, but I took off 2 days when my husband's parents were here earlier in the week. They flew out here SPECIFICALLY to see us. Why would I not take time off?

My biggest question here is, WHAT DO I DO? How do I tell my mom that I'm not coming to see her because she's never put forth the effort to see me? Should I just cut ties with my mom, in the sense of visiting? Maybe I'm just ranting, but I'm really at a breaking point, and so is my husband. </TEXT>

<TITLE> For those going to Cannon AFB </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-16 16:40:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've seen a few posts of people going to Cannon, and asking what there is to do. I've decided to compile a list of what I recommend. I left Cannon in September of 2014, so if anything has popped up since then, I probably don't know about it.

If you like to drink, you'll like CAFB. If you like cheap drinks, go to the Drop Zone. Even better if you live in the dorms, just stumble your ass home. If you don't like to drink/underage, and you have a car, sign up to do AADD. Something to do, and drunk people are hilarious.

Ned Houk Park is on the outskirts and it's really nice. Good hiking trails, good for biking. AND THERE'S GRASS!! I've only been there once, and I enjoyed it, as did my dog.

I'm pretty sure the base has a dog park now, so take the pup for a trip. The Chapel and Outdoor Rec offer a lot of trips like snowboarding, couple's retreats, and nice events for single airmen. Most take you to Taos, Ruidoso, Albuquerque...I never took any trips through them. Even if you decide to venture off on your own. Outdoor Rec will rent you equipment for cheap. 

If you live in the dorms, dorm management throws a BBQ every once in a while... and they have free beer!

I was on a Roller Derby Team while I was there. (Not sure if they're still up and running, but if anyone is interested in this, I can contact someone). This is good for the guys and the gals! They always need referees and non-skating officials. Even if the Clovis team isn't around anymore, Amarillo and Lubbock also have teams.

I haven't explored Amarillo much, but I heard the shopping is good. (Hour and a half away)

Lubbock was a place my friends and I frequented often (Hour and a half away). There's a couple of clubs out there ( I recommend HEAVEN, it's a gay club, but it was tons of fun) They have a decent mall and some good restraunts. For those of you who don't know any better, don't eat off shore seafood. Lubbock also has an airport. Tickets are a little bit more expensive than Albuquerque, but it's easier to find someone willing to drive you to LBB than it is ABQ.

Speaking of Albuquerque (3.5- 4 hours away). I've been there approximately 6 times. Each time was to take someone to the airport/pick them up. My husband and I drove through there on the way to California, and I have to say, it's beautiful.  I'm sure there are great places to hike. There's a few casinos, and a Hard Rock Cafe. 

I'm not sure if the base theatre is still running, but definitely do that. Super cheap for a movie. That place is good for more than just an all-call.  /u/FerTheDiddly said that it is free entry and they sell beer.

Another thing, if you like to bang chicks..wear a condom. Cannon is a fucking cess-pool. Everybody is having sex with each other and most people there have had an STD at least once. Especially the dorm rats.

Check out Hillcrest Park. It's dinky, but it's green. EDIT: They have a zoo. Second biggest in the state. And it's a good place for your dog to run. Thanks /u/FerTheDiddly

I think there is a place called Yute Lake where you can camp and fish. Pretty sure you can rent a boat from Outdoor Rec as well.

One of the surrounding towns is Portales. I know they have a brewery. I never really went out there because I was too lazy to explore. Nice houses out there too.

Add in from Comments: Buy a gun and take up some shooting. I believe they just opened an indoor range right off base. There's also Patriot Outdoors. Thanks /u/TheCorvus303

Add in from Comments: Sign up for OPFOR. You got out on the range (Melrose) and help train the SOF dudes. One of my friends got to do this and he said he had a blast. Thanks /u/FerTheDiddly

This is about all I can come up with now, but I will add more as I think of it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! I was there for 2 1/2 years and managed to survive.

Edit: Welcome to Af-Can-istan. Clovi-Dishu. Make the most of it. Make friends. 

Men: You're going to have to find your women elsewhere... unless you go after a military chick, the women in Clovis are sketchy.

<TEXT> My husband and I will be moving from Florida to California in a few weeks.

I am here to ask about the best way to move our pets. We have a cat and a dog. We will be getting a U-Haul with a trailer to tow our car (full tow).
 My plan is to the animals in the towed car, put a plastic sheet on my back seats for the dog (she gets car sick), and to place my cat in the front seat in a carrier. Is it safe to have my animals in the car, vs the U-Haul? Is it legal? Am I allowed to think about our comfort in this situation. 

We will be stopping every 3-4 hours for fuel, so we can let the dog out to potty, and put the cat's litter box in the car. I don't want my cat roaming the car while we aren't in it, since he has claws and likes to claw everything, lol..

Please let me know whether or not this is a good plan. If it is not, please provide me with some alternatives. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Received job offer and accepted, HR won't respond. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-02 22:14:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted something similar a few weeks ago, but now the situation is a little different.

I interviewed with my company on March 3rd. I was also given an offer and I accepted. They did not give me a start date because they still needed to complete the background check.

I was prior military, so I think it shouldn't take that long. I joined at 18 and got out at 21. Also, I have a security clearance. 

Anywho, I heard from the company who is responsible for background checks, a few days after my acceptance. I sent them the paper work they needed and haven't heard about it since.

I have emailed HR with questions about a start date and for an explanation of my moving benefits. This was 2 weeks ago. I didn't hear from her for a week, so I emailed the recruiter who I have never had an issue getting in contact with. 

I emailed her last Wednesday, and she responded almost immediately. She told me she would forward my email to the HR lady and I would hear from her by close of business on Thursday. Never heard anything. Their offices are closed every other Friday, so didn't hear anything then either.

I waited it out on Monday, to give her a chance to get to my email. Didn't hear anything. I emailed her again on Tuesday and still haven't heard anything.

I'm not trying to hound them, but I can't wait much longer. This job will require me to move from my home in Florida to California. I'm afraid this is going to turn into a "you-have-two-weeks-to-get-here" kinda thing.

My question is, should I try to email HR again? Should I email the reliable recruiter again, and let her know I never heard from HR? Should I just suck it up and wait?

Update: I emailed the recruiter again because I'm impatient. 5She  minutes later, HR lady called me. I apologized off the bat for bombarding them with emails and she said that realistically, that's the best way to get anything done. I now have a start date  of April 27 and information on my moving benefits (they pay for everything and give me temporary housing, fuck yeah) But really, I only have 2 weeks to move, lol. At least in my head. I would like to get out there prior to the start date to ensure I can actually go look at houses and such. Thanks for the input guys ;D </TEXT>

Our original plan was to rent a 10ft Uhual and tow our car. Due to our finances, we are looking into towing a 4 X 8 trailer with our 2010 Honda Civic (4 door 2wd). 

Based on what I saw on the Uhual website, as long as we have a tow hitch rated for 2000lbs, we'll be able to town a maximum of 1,150 lbs.

My question is, how bad will this hurt my car? Is it worth the wear and tear? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Offered employment with no start date and have to move across the country (Advice) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-20 00:52:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted this in r/jobs, but I figured I could get more help here. 

On March 3rd, I interviewed with my company and received and signed an offer letter immediately after. I knew going in that they wanted me because of my experience.

I believe my background check started on March 5th. I was in the military for 3 years, and this is my first job, besides that. I've been unemployed since September and I'm getting worried because the money is running out.

I currently live in Florida, and will have to relocate to California. Because I have no start date, I can't really get any quotes on moving trucks (price changes based on dates), I haven't really TRIED to lock down a home rental, because I'm afraid of getting my heart set on a particular home and then being beat out by someone else.

I will be making relatively good money, and receiving a lump sum for moving expenses in my first paycheck. At this point in time, my husband and I have enough money to pay for a truck (based on a quote we got for a specific date) pay deposits on a home (at the lowest end of our price range), electric, etc, if we pick up and move right now. But obviously, that's not a good idea without ACTUALLY being employed. The longer I have to wait for a start date, the less money we are going to have. We live with my in laws, so we don't have any bills outside of our car/insurance/cell phones... aside from a few medical bills.

The point of this post is to ask what I should do. We are planning on getting a loan, but we don't know how much is appropriate. But, I spoke to my sister in law, who is a loan officer, and she basically said that my offer letter means nothing to banks, that until I have a start date that won't give me anything. She also said that my best option, if I get denied a personal loan, would be to refinance my car. ( I have no idea what this means)

 In California, it is not required for a landlord to give you a fridge, but my inlaws are giving us a mini fridge, so that's not really a problem. We will need a washer and dryer (washer first and foremost, I'll hang my shit outside, lol).

If anyone has any advice please comment away! </TEXT>

<TEXT> On March 3rd, I interviewed with my company and received and signed an offer letter immediately after. I knew going in that they  wanted me because of my experience.

I believe my background check started on March 5th. I was in the military for 3 years, and this is my first job, besides that. I've been unemployed since September and I'm getting worried because the money is running out.

I currently live in Florida, and will have to relocate to California. 
Because I have no start date, I can't really get any quotes on moving trucks (price changes based on dates), I haven't really TRIED to lock down a home rental, because I'm afraid of getting my heart set on a particular home and then being beat out by someone else.

I will be making relatively good money, and receiving a lump sum  for moving expenses in my first paycheck. At this point in time, my husband and I have enough money to pay for a truck (based on a quote we got for a specific date) pay deposits on a home (at the lowest end of our price range), electric, etc. The problem is, we are going to be FLAT broke until I get paid, which could take some time to stabilize.

<TEXT> I currently live with my mother and father-in-law. I was in the military and separated, so this is our best option until we find employment. Let me just say, I'm very appreciative of what they are doing for us, but I just gotta rant about them.

Nice people, don't really have an issues with them. They drive me up the fucking wall, though. I'm accused of being lazy and not doing anything all day. Yeah, I sleep until 1pm sometimes, but I still do everything I'm supposed to.

I ensure the house is clean every day when they get home from work, I feed their dog and chickens. I told my MIL if she would tell me what to make for dinner, I would make it and she wouldn't have to do a thing. I STILL GET BITCHED AT. 

These people are so dirty. I spend at least an hour a day on the kitchen, and it just gets SO BAD. Everytime they use the stove, I have to scrub the fuck out of it. They could use just ONE burner (gas stove) and the entire stove needs to be cleaned again.  That's just the tip of the iceberg right there.

What really set me off is what happened over the past few days. On Christmas day,  I went over to my sister's house and didn't get home until around 5pm. I usually feed the dogs around 3pm, so I asked MIL, "have the dogs been fed?" she replies, "MY dog is." REALLY? I FEED YOUR DOG EVERY FUCKING DAY AND YOU CAN'T FEED MINE JUST ONCE???? GAH!

Yesterday, around 3pm, I walked outside to smoke. I let their dog in the house so I could let mine out. (They stay in the yard when they are let out individually, but when they are out together, they tend to run off.) Anyway I went outside and smoked, and 8 minutes later I call for my dog and she isn't coming. So I go inside and what do I see? The back door is fucking open and nobody told me. Wow. The dogs ran off because once I had let their dog inside, she darted out the back door.

Now at this point, everyone is blaming me for this happening. My FIL is already upset because a few days ago, their other dog died. (He had heartworm and we knew it was coming) My dog came back around 7pm (4hrs later). So now everyone is mad at me because I'm happy my dog came back. (Last time they ran off, my hubby and I would drive around the nearby neighborhoods every few hours to look for both dogs. Whenever my MIL would go outside to call, she would only call for her dog.) Now, around 930pm their dog still isn't back, so me, hubby, SIL and her hubbs, go look in the woods. It's dark as shit, its swampy, and full of ticks. No sign of her. We drive around looking, no sign of her.

Around 5 am, I was outside smoking and scrolling through the lost pets page for our area. (I had been all night, everytime I smoked, but didn't see it on my newsfeed) Anyway, I saw that someone had seen two dogs, described as our dogs, get hit by a car. I run inside and tell hubby, and we all get in the car (excluding MIL/FIL) and go to the last known area. (It was posted at 9pm, so chances were slim)

We drive up and down the streets, calling for her, to no avail. Our husbands get out of the car and are searching the ditches and everything. We can't find her, so we head home. Every hour or so we would check outside for her. (I stayed up til 8am) MIL finally decided to look for her own damn dog, and found her in a neighbor's yard.

I came out in the living room, and she says " She's so sick, she got hit by a car..blah blah blah." At some point it evolved into, "we're not blaming you, we're blaming Honey." (my dog).  what the everliving fuck. You're seriously blaming a dog for doing what dogs do... and running? WHAT THE FUCK. And then somehow, this conversation gets turned on me being lazy. Dear freaking god.

TL:DR: I fucking hate people. </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by collecting firewood. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-11 04:26:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This happened a few hours ago.

There is supposed to be a "freeze" tonight where I live. My husband decided he was going to start a fire, so he asked me to go outside and help him collect wood. My husband took the wood from out large stock pile in the front yard, tapped out the wood and placed it in my arms. I was able to carry about 6 or 7 pieces.

I go inside and drop the wood in front of the fire place. The very first piece that my husband had placed in my arms had a giant fucking spider on it. This piece of wood had been in my arms for a good 3 minutes. I have a crazy fear of spiders so I started crying and ran into the kitchen.

This thing was about the size of a silver dollar. We didn't have any bug spray, so we tried to kill it with oven cleaner. The spider was absolutely drenched and drowning in this shit and it wouldn't fucking die. My husband doesn't like spiders either so it was up to my mother-in-law to smack the shit out of it with a dust pan and then throw it out the door.

I'm never getting firewood again.

TL:DR: Got fire wood, had a spider, cried like a bitch. </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by visiting my dad. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-08 14:59:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Note: This is long.

Backstory: My dad is a truck driver and was going to be close by this weekend. I live in a part of Florida that he doesn't get to very often, so my husband and I decided to drive the brief 4 1/2 hours to get there for a weekend of fun!

The Story: My husband and I leave our house around 1pm(Friday). Other than being extremely hungover from the night before, I was happily driving and nom nom noming on my McDonalds. About 1 hour down the road, I realize something.  I FORGOT MY FUCKING BIRTH CONTROL. Now, anyone who knows anything about the pill knows you don't miss pills, you just don't.

So, I turn around and head back home. We arrive at the house, let the dog out of the car for a few minutes, and I grab my pills. It is now around 3pm. About 2 hours behind schedule. Oh well, just a few more hours, no big deal.

Fast forward another hour, all is going well when my dog decides to puke the most massive, stinky puke ever. I had a sheet down, and thankfully towels underneath, so nothing got on my seat. We pull over and shake out the sheet.  Problem solved, on our way again.

We finally arrive around 8pm. We eat some linguine with clams, dick around, and go to bed. We wake up around 8am, chill in the hotel room with my dad and stepmom.

That night (Saturday), we go to the bar with my parents and a few of their trucker friends. We're all having a good time, getting a little faded, eating some chicken wings and dancing to the juke box. My dad went to the bar around 2pm, so needless to say, he was pretty drunk around 9pm when he decided to go back to the room. One of his friends decides to go to the room and beg my dad to sing. My dad doesn't want to, warns the dude to leave him alone, and he just won't let it go. This leads to my parents fighting. An all-out, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you, kind of fight.

Around 11pm, I was sick of trying to mediate, so I went back to the bar for a few more drinks. My husband shows up and sits with me, then my dad shows up. Some completely plastered black guy decides to poke my dad in the ribs. This dude was around 6'3 (according to my dad he was at least 28 feet tall, lol). Anyway, my dad turns and looks at him and is giving this stare like, "I'm going to kick your fucking ass". I run in between them and say to the guy, "Please apologize to him, he's in a bad mood, and I don't want any problems. I'll buy you a beer if you want." I give him a quick bro hug (the handshake, backtap kind). He tells me to give him a kiss on the cheek, to which I respond "I'm married, that's inappropriate". My husband doesn't like this, so he says, "Are you trying to put the moves on my wife?" Black guy walks over, husband says, "get the fuck out of here". Dad gives hubby mad props, black guy walks off, we go outside to smoke.

While we're outside smoking, black guy shows up again. We play it off cool like nothing happened, he gets an attitude and calls us racist. He walks inside. Another dude who was out there says, "I bet he has a fucking gun." Oh, great. We walk back over to our room while we have the chance. A few minutes go by and my husband and I go walk the dogs. Now, my dog doesn't bark unless there is trouble, so when she starts barking and I look up, WHO DO I FUCKING SEE? Black guy from the bar. You've got to be fucking kidding me. This guy looks like he's ready for trouble. He walks by us, and doesn't even look at us. Phew.

THEN BAM! Cops roll up. We ask who they're looking for, and they say a black male in all red. We tell him he went "that way". They stop him and then come back in tell us that he didn't actually have a gun. I guess he pissed off more people when he went back into the bar, so they called the cops. Okay, problem solved, let's go to bed.

Next Morning (Sunday), I wake up with quite the hangover, which is weird because I didn't even get drunk the night before and I was actually drinking water. FML. Anyway, my dad runs over to the nearest fast food place to pick up breakfast for everyone. Who do we see walk up through the parking lot? Black guy from the bar. WTF. He walks up to our door, (which was open, as it was nice out) and stands there for a second. My step-mom, nicely asks how he's doing. And let me tell you, this dude can't even fucking talk he's so drunk. We don't think he slept from the night before. AND he's carrying around a bottle of Ciroc. Well, then he decides to step INTO our room. I say, "Please don't walk in our room, get out." He comes in closer, so my husband ushers him out the door, and shuts the door in his face. Dude walks over to the window and starts pounding on the window. Husband closes curtains. Dad walks up, see dude trying to peek in the window. Guy clenches his fist, dad gets pissed, tells me to call the cops.

As soon as he heard that we were calling the cops, he walked off. I called the cops and they show up about 5-10 minutes later. We explain that there was an altercation the night before with this guy, and they take off to look for him. Since they had stopped him the night before, they were able to pick him up. They drove back by to let us know that they threw him in jail for the day. Cool. I feel a dick, but he was an asshat. 

Later that day, I was going through some pictures my parents had gotten out of storage for me. I found some pictures of my mom, my nana... OH MY FUCKING GOD ITS MY DAD'S ASSHOLE. I see pictures of my dad's asshole, my mom sucking his dick, my step mom sucking his dick, him giving it to my step mom. LIKE REALLY? I'm scarred for fucking life. /r/Eyebleach Anyway, I enjoy the rest of my day, eat some steaks and go to bed.

Now, my parents have left and I'm sitting in the hotel typing this. We survived the weekend. Which is honestly a miracle every time we hang out with my parents, lol. We should be should be leaving in about an hour to head back home. Which reminds me, my dog has barely eaten this whole trip and she hasn't pooped. I really hope she doesn't shit in the car.

TLDR; Hungover, Forgot BC pills, turned around. Dog pukes. Go to bar, everyone gets drunk, fight ensues. Black guy trolls us at bar, cops show up. Next day black guy shows up, get him thrown in jail. Look at old pics, see dad's dick. Scarred. Dog won't shit.

<TITLE> TIFU by feeding my dogs turkey grease </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-29 10:04:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I actually fucked up the Friday before Thanksgiving. My mother-in-law, who I live with, is a school teacher and at her school, the Friday before Turkey Day, they have their own little feast. That being said, she made a turkey on Thursday for school.

Since I am unemployed, I maintain the household as far as cleaning goes. So, Friday morning I was cleaning the kitchen and I got the idea to use the turkey grease to coat the dog food. Not alot, just a quick splash to give the food a nice coating. The dogs happily chowed down on their food and gave me lots of kisses to show their appreciation. Look at me! Being a good mom to my fur babies!

A little back ground on the dogs, there are three. Chester is a 9 year old black lab, who we are pretty sure is close to dying due to his heartworm. His asshole leaks as it is, but he's pretty good at controlling his bowels.

Then there is Nyla, a beautiful 2 year old German Shepherd. Total sweetheart. She isn't very good at letting people know she needs to go to the bathroom, but don't usually have any issues with her.

Last but certainly not least, my darling 2 year old Black Lab/Hound mix, Honey. Best dog ever, I swear. She never barks, never shits in the house, she cuddles. 

Now for the real fuck up. My in laws went on vacation for Thanksgiving, so my husband and I had the house to ourselves. Nyla usually sleeps in their room. We put her in the hallway near our room, so if she barked or anything, we would be able to hear her. We let Honey out there with her so she wouldn't get lonely. Nyla kept whining for hours. I let her out at least twice while this was going on.

It's about 4 in the morning when hubby and I decided to hit the hay. We open the door to go to the bathroom to brush our teeth...what we see and smell is awful. Starting from our bedroom door, going 8 feet into the bathroom and then back out to the hallway, ANOTHER 8 feet, is the nastiest, greenest, foulest smelling shit I've ever seen.

All I could do was stare in awe at how she managed to shit so much, it trailed for a good 16 feet. After a quick bitch session, we began to clean it up. I went to the laundry room (this is where Chester sleeps) to fetch the mop. LOW AND BEHOLD ANOTHER MASSIVE FUCKING SHIT. This shit pile was bigger than a dinner plate. And it was runny, smelly, and green.

By the time this was all cleaned up, it was about 5 in the morning. I thought to my self, wow, Honey is such a good girl! Didn't even shit like the rest of them! We ended up putting Nyla on the back porch in case she shit again.

Next morning: I wake up to let the dogs out. What do I find? Shit. Chester had shit in the laundry room again. This time it was all over the washing machine and dryer. Nyla also shit all over the back porch. She even shit on her bed. By this time, I'm absolutely fed up! But I thought, hey, what can you do? Nyla slept on the back porch again, Chester in the laundry room, and Honey in bed with us.

Next day: I get out of bed and prepare my self for the literal shit show I'm about to see. YAY! There isn't any shit! There is a god!

Later that day: I'm sitting in bed eating some General Tso's Chicken (NOM NOM NOM). I say to my husband, "Babe, I've cleaned up so much shit these past two days, I can still smell it" He gets up and moves our recliner and says " Well, Honey shit too." SO ONCE AGAIN, I get to clean up shit. Shit that had been sitting there for 2 days and was dry around the sides, wet in the middle.

Needless to say, I will never again feed my mammals turkey grease.

TL:DR Tried to be a loving owner and fed my 3 dogs turkey grease. Two day shit-fest ensues.

<TITLE> My dog got bit by something... can anyone possibly identify? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-29 00:08:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Species: Dog

Age: 9 years

Sex/Neuter status: Male/ Not Neutered

Breed: Black Lab

Body weight: 60lbs+

History: Never got treated for heartworm, so he's very swollen as it is. (we believe he's about to die.. slowed down a lot in the past few months) 
   
Clinical signs: I went to bring him inside today and noticed his left leg was swollen at the joint, but his opposite leg was not. Upon further inspection, I saw a quarter sized wound on the outside of his paw. Managed to snap a picture of that [Here](http://imgur.com/rQaWjbv). Adjacent to that on the bottom of his paw where the pad is, there is another dime sized wound. On the opposite side of the large wound, there is a smaller oval shaped wound. He doesn't seem to be in any pain, other than not walking on it. There is no visual bleeding. I flushed it out with peroxide and wrapped it in gauze. I talked to a vet tech friend of mine and she said it looks like a snake bite, which is odd since snakes aren't usually out around this time of the year.


Duration: Had to have happened in the early after noon today.

Your general location: Jacksonville, Florida </TEXT>
