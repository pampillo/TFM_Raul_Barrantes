<TEXT> Its junk science just because you said so?  You also said it was hotter in the 40s then it is now which is clearly not true.  Sorry im not moving my stance i have done and seen plenty of research and global warming is still clearly real.  For example during the university level geology courses i have taken have have been vastly helpful in understanding the history of our planet including carbon and temperature data, which of course makes it clear that we are in a completely unseen level of raising temperature due to human activity.  While these were not classes directly focusing on global warming they did talk about things like glaciers which are clearly in retreat today and how we can date rocks to a time period and that is a useful record for climates.  Learning things about rocks that formed years before any records would be kept and before people existed are one of the single most crucial things in learning about the climates of the past.  That is actually just the tip of the iceberg as to classes or research i have done.  None it made me come to the conclusion that global warming was fake in fact it only strengthened my belief in man made global warming and its evidence.  

As to the rest of your post

"Even if you were to come up with save the environment, what energy source will you use? How will prevent monopolies from existing?"

Even nuclear power is way more safe then coal and fossil fuels, yes its not perfect but they do produce an absolutely crazy amount of energy.   All you need to do is ensure its secure and safe.  The mining and pollution from fossil fuels kills and makes people unhealthy.  We have numerous ways to make nuclear power safe.  To add to this it gives us plenty of time to boost our renewable energy sources wind, solar while dropping our reliance on fossil fuels.

Im not a fan of hydro electric as it causes fights over water rights among states and countries and can cause problems for wildlife in the rivers they are built on.  Your of course free to say its kind of like nuclear power in that it has its problems and is still better the fossil fuels, and i would not disagree with that.  Im not super opposed to hydro electric i just don't think its the best source of energy.


the second part about how will prevent monopolies from existing?  Assuming your talking about corporate monopolies like standard oil or us steel.  We already have anti trust laws in the united states and other countries if an energy company gets too big or totally integrates to the point of monopoly then it will get broken up.  if your talking about an over reliance on a single source i would say that only matters if said source has dangerous elements to it, fossil nuclear etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you have posted is total bullshit all of it.  Your post also suggests you clearly did not even read my post.  I  suggest reading my post again.  None of it is junk science its rather well cited in fact.  Just because you refuse to accept it does not make it not true.  Also your continued refusal to accept facts has been noted once again.

Either you glossed over or did not read the post.


"We also need not worry about environmental calamities even if the current natural warming trend continues. The Earth has been much warmer during the past 3,000 years without catastrophic effects."

Yes do continue to ignore that Earth atmospheric CO2 levels has never been above 300ppm. Also continue to ignore the completely unprecedented rise in temperatures.


"Mankind is moving the carbon in coal, oil, and natural gas from be low ground to the atmosphere, where it is available for con - version into living things."  

My god you don't even understand the carbon cycle properly.



"The whole point of global warming is to sway unacademic idiots like yourself and to put an end to capitalism, gain control of the economy through subversive means, fund the green party/environmentalists, profiteering through a frivolous tax and etc."


Blatant and pathetic strawman.


"As coal, oil, and natural gas are used to feed and lift from poverty vast numbers of people across the globe, more CO2 will be released into the atmosphere. This will help to maintain and improve the health, longevity, prosperity, and profuctivity of all people."

Complete bullshit fossil fuels will make people more healthy?  Why surely a few black lung providing coal jobs is just what people need.  You also must have missed the current massive poverty worldwide in countries that have plenty of fossil fuels.

You are an infantile troglodyte who is still wrong and still unable to provide any valid sources.

Please continue to cry about how i am "disrespectful".  A quick run through of your comment history is more then enough for anyone with half a brain to see that you are extremely disrespectful troll yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your fucking wrong deal with it!


In the last 650k years, Earth has gone through 7 periods of glacial advance and retreat. The last was 7k years ago, marking the end of the Ice Age.

CO2 was demonstrated to trap heat in the mid 19th century. In the course of the last 650k years, Earth atmospheric CO2 levels has never been above 300ppm, and we know that through mineral deposits, fossils, and arctic ice leaving telltale predictable signs of how much CO2 must have been in the air at the time. Today, CO2 is over 400ppm. Not only have we kept fantastic records pre-industrial revolution, especially the Swedes for centuries, but arctic ice has acted as a more recent history of the last several dozen centuries. CO2 levels has been growing at unprecedented rates and achieving levels higher than we've ever known to occur that wasn't in the wake of planetary disaster and mass extinction. It follows that if CO2 traps heat, and there's more CO2 in the atmosphere than ever before, it's going to trap more heat than ever before.

Sea levels are rising. 17cm over the last century. The last decade alone has seen twice the rise of the previous century. So not only are the oceans rising, but the rate of rise is increasing exponentially.

The Earth's average temperature has increased since 1880, most of that has been in the last 35 years. 15 of the 16 hottest years have been since 2001. We're in a period of solar decline, where the output of the sun cycles every 11 or so years. Despite the sun putting out less energy, the average continues to rise and in 2015 the Earth's average was 1C hotter on average than in 1890. That doesn't sound like much, but if we go some 0.7C hotter, we'll match the age of the dinosaurs when the whole planet was a tropical jungle. That's not a good thing.

The ice caps are losing mass. While we've seen cycles of recession and growth, you have to consider ice is more than area, it's also thickness and density. Yes, we've seen big sheets of ice form, but A) they didn't stay, and B) how thick were they? Greenland has lost 60 cubic miles of ice and Antarctica has lost at least 30 cubic miles, both in the last decade. Greenland is not denying global warming, they're feverishly building ports to poise themselves as one of the most valuable ocean trading hubs in the world as the northern pass is opening, and it's projected you'll be able to sail across the north pole, a place you can currently stand, year-round.

Glacier ice is retreating all over the world, in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.

The number of unprecedented intense weather events has been increasing since 1950 in the US. The number of record highs has been increasing, and record lows decreasing.

The ocean absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere. CO2 and water makes carbonic acid, - seltzer water! The oceans are 30% more acidic since the industrial revolution. 93% of The Great Barrier Reef has been bleeched and 22% and rising is dead as a consequence. The ocean currently absorbs 9.3 billion tons of CO2 a year and is currently absorbing an additional 2 billion tons annually. Not because the ocean is suddenly getting better at it, but because there's more saturation in the atmosphere.

In the 1860s, physicist John Tyndall recognized the Earth's natural greenhouse effect and suggested that slight changes in the atmospheric composition could bring about climatic variations. In 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first predicted that changes in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.

<TEXT> While this person was not a total stranger it was still someone i had only known for a week.  It also seems like r/thathappened material.



I was in high school and was being bullied by someone i knew from middle school.  This kid was harmless basically and not very big just annoying.  This happened in my electronics class and i sat at the same table every time.  This kid was a decently large senior who i generally talked to since it was a mourning class.  He witnessed this for a few days and on the second week when the kid who bullied me started up again like normal he did the following.  He stood up and told the kid too shut the fuck and sit down or he would beat the shit outta him "Right now" and he said if he ever even heard you were bothering him i will beat the shit out of you.  That kid would not even look at me funny for fear of this kid beating the ever loving shit out of him.

He had no real reason to stand up for me and while threatening violence is certainly not the answer it did work in that instance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> pathologically lie about everything constantly.  The worst was he lied and said his aunt owned an apartment and no one else had bought any of the apartments in her building, The apartments were all sold out pretty quickly as it was a pretty wealthy area.  It was always really pointless things to lie about, usually for no reason just for attention.

I actually felt bad for the kid so i was nice too him and did not really call him out, i know that was probably not really gonna help him in the long run though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember one time a red wings player got injured in an untelevised preseason game.  Someone said fuck milan lucic and blamed him.  Someone responded how can you blame lucic when the game is not aired. 

He was at -150 for having suggesting not blaming a bruin for an injury no one saw.  I stick to the game threads in the bruins subs and other boston subs because of this toxic bs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really crazy so much as really fucking funny.  One day when the teacher left the room we ended up looking inside a cup on his desk to find that the trouble maker of the class/basically the whole school had a fucking laminated hall pass with his name on it to the office.  I guess he got tired of writing hall passes to send him to the office.

This was in his homeroom btw.

"Those comments though. Woke as fuck/s"

Why would you respond Goyum to that comment?  Hmm could it be that you are angry because you consider attacking the nazi and racial comments to be an attack on you and your beliefs because they are identical to those who made those comments.

The answer is clearly yes and your not fooling anyone.  </TEXT>

Trust me pats fans are committed to making sure evil wins even when the pats get eliminated (which will happen at some point)

i would vote evil even if the giants were the last/only evil team left trust me. </TEXT>

I scrolled down to the comments and they were filled with exactly what your describing.

<TEXT> According to the description after years of mining deep into the Earths crust, layers of a carnallite now line the tunnels with a spectacular mix of coloured rock. Used in the process of plant fertilisation, the mineral can appear in a variety of colours including white, red, yellow and blue. Although a small part of the mine is still in use, miles of tunnels now lay abandoned   are only accessible with a special government permit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know i started out not hating black lives matter protesters. Because after all i think police brutality is a bit out of control.  That said everything they have done since has been embarrassing to see.  Blocking roads, Pushing reporters, faking death threats, Threatening to kill people, interupting politicians at rallys and bullying students in a library who were just trying to study etc.

A real conversation about police brutality in America is sorely needed.  But your hurting the anti police violence movement by acting like this.  Furthermore all this does is hurt race relations on both sides.

<TEXT> I am not a lawyer. But didn't they rule in Brandenburg v. Ohio that the government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, imminent lawless action.  I feel this guys a scumbag but probably didn't cross the line to the point were he flat out tells people to do it.  On the other hand its not entirely unreasonable for this to be interpreted as inciting violence.
Idk can someone with better knowledge on this shed some light on this?

<TEXT> I have not watched the video because it appears to have been removed and i am not a lawyer.  But didn't they rule in Brandenburg v. Ohio that the government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, imminent lawless action.  So i guess it depends on what he said.

Idk can someone with better knowledge on this shed some light on this?

EDIT:  I watched a mirror and it appears he does not straight up say anything that would be punishable.  Still hes a fucking scumbag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly im kind of suprised this did not end with suicide.  Seems like a lot of these guys end it before being caught.

Edit:Sounds like an officer was killed in the line of duty.  I looked around and found a fundraiser for his family https://www.youcaring.com/the-family-of-officer-swasey-rachel-swasey-and-children-477034

Not sure if its legit could someone help verify?  Oh and if this is against the rules i will edit my comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eh the only time i would consider it ok to sell an account is in regards to shared steam accounts that you want to pay back one person for what they spent on the account making it yours 100%.

Anything outside of that is just straight asking for trouble.  Its also against the rules to sell steam accounts on this sub i believe.

By shared i mean like two brothers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With winter approaching its a good time to make sure you know how to drive for the conditions. Go well below the speed limit.  Things like ice, heavy snow, traffic and poor visibility will require longer following and stopping distances.  People need to allow at least 8 to 10 seconds for stopping.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of people probably wont think this is that big a deal but i recently lost 50 pounds and anything that used to be difficult like running in the mourning is now a lot easier and exciting.  

Just waking up and going for a run is exciting because i could hardly do it before. </TEXT>
