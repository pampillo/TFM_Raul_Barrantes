<TITLE> Dawn </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 19:25:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Dawn is my little sister. When I was 11 and she was just a tiny baby, I hurt her really badly. I didnt know what I did was going to cause so much trouble. I just wanted to do something nice. Something that would make us happy. 

My parents made me go away for a long time. I didnt understand why everyone was so angry. I missed my sister terribly. Even worse, I felt betrayed by the people Id expected to understand me. 

After six years of hospitalization, I got to see her again. My parents had passed away in a car accident while I was gone and I went to live with my aunt and uncle. Both were psychologists. Both understood the problem I apparently had. Still, they believed Id learned to cope with it over the course of my rehabilitation. And they were right. I would never hurt anyone again. The mere thought of it was abhorrent.

Dawn had no memory of me. Under the watchful eyes of my aunt and uncle, I was reintroduced to her life and I got to discover the wonderful person shed become. She was even more perfect than Id remembered. As I stared at her, I wondered if I would have the same inclination to hurt her thatd gotten me in so much trouble six years ago. 

I studied her body: her small feet; her narrow shoulders; the way her thin arms terminated at her hands. God, her hands. But I didnt feel anything other than happiness. No, I wouldnt hurt Dawn. Not again. My aunt and uncle beamed when I kissed those little hands.

The first morning I was back, I woke up and went downstairs. My aunt was cleaning mud off the floor. Muddy footprints had covered the hallway and kitchen and had gone halfway up the stairs. Dawn, whod gotten up before me, was getting a stern talking-to. Despite her protestations and claims of innocence, my aunt was having none of it. Dawn wasnt to go outside before the rest of the house had gotten up. It was dangerous and, well, we could see it was messy. So no more. Dawn just looked sad. I didnt know what to say. I felt a little flicker of hope.

Over the next two weeks, those muddy footprints showed up three more times. The first two times Dawn was yelled at. The third time was met with a spanking. I cried out to my uncle and begged him not to hurt her. I said it wasnt her fault. In response, my uncle just carried Dawn to one of the footprints, put her foot next to it, and showed me. It was the exact same thing. My flicker of hope became a bonfire.

That night, I heard giggling outside the door to my bedroom. High-pitched, girlish giggles. My heart pounded in my chest. I closed my eyes and listened while I thought about tiny muddy footprints and my lips pressing against Dawns hands. Those silly, kissable little hands.

In the morning, Dawn was getting spanked again. There was more mud on the floor. This time there were handprints, too. While my uncle disciplined her, I began screaming at him those arent Dawns handprints! Look at them! Theyre not! Theyre not! In a haze of desperation and sadness about the unfair treatment of my sister, I burst out of the house and ran. 

I ran for what felt like hours; arms pumping, lungs burning, feet slapping the wet forest soil. Finally, I got to where I wanted to be: about a mile away from our old house - the house Id been taken from six years ago. Beneath the cluster of oak trees thatd grown even taller since the last time Id been shaded by them, were ten, gaping holes in the dirt. The bonfire of hope Id been stoking erupted into pyroclastic explosion of joy.

It had worked.

The forest blurred around me as I ran back to my aunt and uncles house. As I grew near, I thought I heard yelling. With each stride closing the distance, the yelling gave way to quiet. My last few steps were in silence.

I opened the backdoor and tried to take it all in. The beaten, mangled bodies of my aunt and uncle were in the corner of the kitchen. The floor was covered in mud and blood and decorated with countless footprints. Dawn was in the middle of the room, beaming. And the others were there, too.

When Dawn was born, I loved her so much it hurt. I wanted to be around her all the time. I would hover as my mom would bathe her and help as my dad would change her diapers. I refused to sleep in my own room. Even if she had to go for a checkup, Id beg my parents to let me go with them. I couldnt bear to have her out of my sight.

After a while, my parents had to have a talk with me. They felt my connection to my sister was unhealthy. They were happy that I cared for her so much, but they worried Id grown codependent. I wasnt allowed to be with her 24/7.

I was devastated.

One afternoon, when Mom was in the shower and Dad was at work, I was watching Dawn in her crib. She smiled and gurgled and waved her tiny hands at me. I kissed them. I kissed each little finger. Right then, I knew I could solve the problem of not seeing her as often as I wanted.

Dawn screamed as I bit off each of her perfect fingers. It didnt take long. I felt terrible as I did it, but I knew it would be worthwhile in the end. I ran as fast as I could into the forest and buried them. They were never found.

Six years later, as I stood in the kitchen of my deceased aunt and uncle, I studied Dawns young face. She seemed confused by what was going on, but she was happy to see me. A safe, familiar face. She reached out to hug me, her fingerless hands clutching my back. Everyone else smiled. Ten Dawns, seeded from her little fingers so many years ago, joined in the embrace. My plan had worked. It took six years of my life, but it was worth it in the end. I would never have to be away from my [sister again.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> HI GUYS ITS YA GIRL MADISON! AND GUESS WHAT?! I HAD MY BABYYYYYYYY! AND SHE DIIIIIIIIIED! Well, I think she did. Not really sure yet. Maybe you can help me!! (Probs not though because almost all of you are like r-word tarded haha)

So remember my [dumb sister Gina](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4ho869/um_can_any_of_you_guys_tell_me_whats_wrong_with/?st=ivbamqdh sh=d65e3411) and then [my gross brother](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5c2xzz/ok_now_my_brother_is_all_messed_up_and_gross_lol/?st=j2gdwat0 sh=d1bc1025) and my [sad story about not finding a boyfriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5i4e1h/omg_guys_why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_a_boyfriend/?st=j2gdwond sh=bc301b6e) and then [learning Im not a virgin anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5myi34/haha_guys_my_parents_think_im_a_virgin_but_im/?st=ixqad0ed sh=2e1a5ff7) and then [why I was sad](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5qiij8/guuuuuuuuuuuuuys_im_saaaaaaaaaaaaad/?st=j2gdxlgy sh=d74eddb8)? Wow thats a lot to know! But you should know it if you dont because Im like awesome lol. MADISON!

Yeeeeeeah so like I was having headaches and I mind-told Gaykev back at home and he was like uuuuuuuuuuuugggflflflflf so I regular-told the school nurse and she had me go home. Mom picked me up and then had to go back to work, so she left me there alone. Then, like, I started to bleed out my eyes lol it was hilarious kinda like I was crying blood but I wasnt crying because I was watching the nice black man on TV with all the funny answers to questions but yeahhhh blood! Out my eyes!

I thought it was a little weird if I do say so myself (I love saying if I do say so myself it makes me sound so sophisticated if I do say so myself lol) so I called the Hierophant and he came over like RIGHT AWAY and made it seem like a BIG DEAL. I dont see what the big deal was. I love Katniss but if she died it wouldnt be that big a deal I guess babies die all the time. Especially around me lololol shhhhhhh.

Annnnnywayyyyyyyy the Hierophant had me lie down and he said stuff like chanting about bodies in bodies and bodies of bodies and Black God and all that then everything got SUPER BLURRY I swear it was like Gaykev was drooling in my eyes again but he was chained up out back so I know it couldnt have been him but like it was still warm and drooly but like DROOLY ENERGY you know? I bet you know.

I felt a ton of pressure behind my eyes like Katniss was kicking again but then it started to itch a LOT and the Hierophant reached down and took his finger and like pushed my eye allllllllll the way to the side and it hurt a lot but then there was this sucking noise and with my other eye I saw him pulling something that looked like clumps of fettuccine out. Guys guys guys guys guys. I gotta tell you something: I LOVE FETTUCCINE.

So like you have to expect when I love something as much as I love fettuccine Im gonna talk about it when I see it so when the Hierophant was pulling out the fettuccine I kept telling him how much I love fettuccine and that fettucine is my favorite and asking him if hed share the fettuccine with Katniss while hes in there and whether or not he was interested in eating the fettuccine with me and can you believe it? He told me to be quiet! I was so super surprised because he never told me anything like that before and I was just trying to communicate - like communication is GOOD for people but no he thought his work was more important so he just kept pulling and pulling the stuff out.

I guess I went to sleep because when I woke up he was still there and still pulling and he was like Im almost done Madison and I was like good because I cant wait to eat fettuccine and then he finally said Madison that isnt fettuccine and I was like what are you talking about it looks like fettuccine and he said shh so I did but I still thought about fettuccine.

Like AN HOUR LATER he was all done and he let me sit up. On the floor near the couch was a big ol pile of stuff that looked a h*ck of a lot like fettuccine but I guess I could tell it wasnt even though I still wanted some. It was really clumpy and stringy and smelled pretty bad and I was like did Katniss make that and the Hierophant just said Madison that is Katniss.

GUYS I WAS SO SHOCKED. Like, Id expected a baby-baby. Not a weird wormy fettuccine baby. It took me a second and I stared at the Hierophant thinking he was making some kind of joke but he just kept chanting stuff over the pile of not-fettuccine and it hit me. Guys. IT WAS KATNISS! My little girl! 

Well I got off the couch and hugged the pile of Katniss fettuccine and it kinda like wriggled and sighed and right then I felt what all new moms must feel when they hold their baby for the first time, like oh my God.

So like we snuggled for a little while and Katniss crawled around in my hair and stuff and I tried to like stick my boob in her a couple times in case she was hungry but she didnt seem interested which was fine because like I thought it was weird to have my boob out in the living room lol. But yeah the Hierophant said one last then then Katniss STOPPED MOVING GUYS.

I was freaking out like oh my god Katniss are you okay but the Hierophant just said shes dead Madison and I was just like oh, okay but like shes still my baby and stuff and we can do things with her now that she isnt stuck to life anymore right and the Hierophant was like yeah thats what weve been waiting all this time for.

So AWESOME, right? I had my baby, my baby died, and now all the great stuff can finally start. The Hierophant is leading Gaykev into the living room and starting to stuff pieces of Katniss back into his dumb brainless head lol I love ya Gaykev and you know I think hes actually getting smarter as more Katniss gets stuffed in there?

Right before he left, the Hierophant chained Gaykev up again and took some Katniss and swallowed her. Bodies in bodies, he said to me as he left. Bodies of bodies!! I yelled back. Lol I dont know what any of it means but it sounds cool and I think a lot of fun stuff is gonna happen. I sure hope its fettuccine [if I do say so myself.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TITLE> A Warning To Women With IUDs </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-05 19:24:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im a doctor working in Hong Kong. I dont want to cause any undue alarm, but after what Ive seen here, I think its important to say something. From what we can tell, contaminated IUDs, manufactured in India, have been shipped overseas. Most went to India and China, but a few thousand ended up in the US and Europe as well.

To begin with, these IUDs have a very high failure rate. They were cheaply manufactured and the copper core is easily fragmented. This means the devices effectiveness drops from above 99% to as low as 60%, depending on the level of damage.

For those who dont know, becoming pregnant while an IUD is still inserted is highly dangerous to both the fetus and the mother. If you believe youve become pregnant while implanted with an IUD, see your doctor immediately. Your life may be at stake.

Theres something else about these IUDs, too. Something I wouldnt have believed if I hadnt seen it with my own eyes.

A few nights ago, there were two pregnant women from the same village brought to the hospital. They were experiencing severe pain and bloating. The initial exams showed they had both been fitted with IUDs and were in their early first trimesters. What shocked us was what we saw on the sonograms.

The fetuses were dramatically larger than they should have been at the first trimester. They were also hideously deformed. It was hard to make out details, but the heads appeared to be hydrocephalic and the hands and legs were equally swollen. Further, they moved swiftly and abruptly, causing enormous pain for the poor mothers.

It took some time to get the medical records for both women, but when we did, it turned out they had the same type of IUDs. Someone on our team worked on contacting the manufacturer while the rest of us tended to the women.

One was worse off than the other. Shortly after being admitted, she began producing a foamy, yellow discharge that was quite noxious and corrosive both to her skin and the bedding. In normal circumstances, such complications would lead to an automatic D C, but considering the size of the fetus, a Cesarean was performed.

I was not on the team who performed the Cesarean, but I saw the aftermath. I heard it.

I still hear it.

The mother died during the procedure. It turned out the discharge was the amniotic fluid mixed the corrosive residue of the IUD as it decayed. In any other situation, this would have killed the fetus as well. But this is not an ordinary fetus.

Right now, as I type this, the second woman has been sedated. I think its for the best. When she began hearing the hideous, keening howls which as of this moment still echo throughout the hallways of this hospital, she realized immediately she had something similar inside her. She was stopped before she could throw herself down the stairs.

The deformed infant, which grows larger by the day inside the now-otherwise-vacant NICU, confounded every expert in both our hospital, as well as the specialists who have been brought in to see it. Confounded, that was, until today. 

Today we received information about the manufacturers of the IUDs. Then it all made terrible, terrible sense.

To the women who are reading this, if your IUD was manufactured between 2010 and 2016, seek help. If youve experienced an inordinate amount of bleeding immediately after the insertion of your IUD, seek help. If youve experienced any unusual discharge at any time following the insertion of your IUD, seek help. All these may be signs that you have one of the contaminated devices. The earliest ones are just beginning to break down. Its all starting.

After Lin got off the phone with someone who knew about the manufacturer, she told me what shed learned. All I could do was stare in disbelief.

The manufacturer of those IUDs was shut down late last year by the Indian government for environmental contamination. When their medical device business had slowed, they began accepting raw materials from unregulated, uninspected, and unlicensed sources. Sources that disposed of chemical waste. Sources that disposed of nuclear waste. Yes, you heard me right. 

These IUDs contain recycled heavy metals and nuclear isotopes. 

I can still hear the mutated fetus screaming with such intense power that I fear our windows will shatter. Even now, I see the belly of the other woman seething with something terrible inside. It wants to get out. And I know these arent the only two.

Please, if you feel you may have been affected, seek help. As I said, this is only[ just starting.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TITLE> Heather's Phases </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-04 19:24:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For as long as Id known Heather, she was into her beauty treatments. Manicures, pedicures, makeovers, all that stuff. I dont even know the words for half of them. Whatever they were, they helped her feel better. Shed always had body issues.

When we first started dating, I noticed she wore an inordinate amount of makeup. It wasnt really my thing, but hell, if it made her happy then who was I to judge? She wasnt a big fan of eating, either. Whenever we went out, shed get a salad or a small piece of chicken or fish. Never anything good like burgers or steaks. It was obvious she didnt want to put any weight on.

We dated for a few years, then I proposed. She said yes. Our wedding was gorgeous, and afterward, we settled into marital bliss.

For a while.

As Heather got older, she grew even more concerned about her appearance. She was 40 when I convinced her to see a therapist. I knew she was depressed; I hoped a professional would provide her with the help she needed. 

Heather saw him for a while, tried a couple medications, then gave it all up. She said nothing worked. That whole time, she barely ate and painted herself with all sorts of expensive products to try and regain the glow shed had when she was younger.

She began looking at alternative medicine online. Stuff on websites that were barely written in English, let alone containing coherent, informative sentences. The online beauty communities raved about certain treatments: some for hair, some for nails, some for skin, some for teeth. Heather ordered it all. And it was expensive. We felt the strain on our budget as she poured more and more of our savings into these products.

I was at a loss. I knew Heather was sick. Id spoken with her mom about it, but there wasnt much she was willing to do. Im pretty sure Heather got a lot of her body issues from her, anyway. All I could do was sit back and watch, even though I did everything I could to comfort her and assure her that she was beautiful.

She was truly beautiful. Of course shed grown older. We both had. Everyone does. But she still could turn heads, and did quite often. Still, she wasnt convinced. It wasnt enough.

One Sunday in April, Heather came to bed crying about the little pouch of fat on her belly. Old lady skin, she called it. I studied her stomach. There was indeed a small amount of fat there. But nothing abnormal. It was something pretty much all women have. Knowing I couldnt tell her otherwise, I just suggested that she use the cucumber skin-tightening lotion she liked so much and that maybe shed feel better in the morning. Heather took my suggestion as a tacit acknowledgement that she looked awful. She screamed and wept and left me in the bedroom.

It wasnt the first time such a scenario had happened. I let her go.

When I came downstairs in the morning, it looked like Heather had been on the computer all night. She was calm, though, which I took as a good sign. I kissed her good morning and went to make some breakfast. 

She joined me in the kitchen and we chatted and even laughed over coffee and cereal before I had to leave for work.

When I came home, Heather was still in a good mood. I asked her how her day had gone, and she told me shed spent it reading and cleaning the house. I looked around. The house really did look great.

We ate dinner and talked. She told me she had some new stuff coming in the mail. Stuff thatd be there the next day. I nodded and didnt ask what. I knew it had to be more makeup or lotion. It always was.

Sure enough, the next day, Heather received a package with some weird writing on it. Definitely not English. Not Chinese or Japanese, either. Maybe Thai? Arabic? Didnt really matter. Id checked the credit card account online and saw it was $150. I wasnt too happy.

After dinner and a movie, Heather took a shower and spent quite a while in the bathroom. She came out eventually, stark naked, and covered from head to toe in a sheen of oily film.

Another new moisturizer,? I asked.

Actually no, she replied. This is for weight loss.

I got worried. Heather was always taking diet pills and fat burners and all that crap, but Id never heard of a weight loss product that you smeared on yourself like a lotion.

Is it safe,? I wondered aloud.

Of course, Heather answered. I dont think theyd be selling it online if it wasnt.

I started to say something and stopped myself. There was no point. At least the stuff smelled good.

Days went by and Heather religiously slathered herself with the product every night. Whatever it was, it didnt seem to be doing her any harm. Her mood was good and it might have been my imagination, but her appetite had actually increased. She even split a rack of ribs with me one night. I gotta tell you, nothings sexier than a woman eating a rack of ribs.

When we got home that night, Heather performed her usual shower, shave, and slather ritual. It did look like shed lost weight. Not a lot - not an unhealthy amount - but still some. She still looked gorgeous. I noticed the lotion smelled different that night. I asked about it.

Its a three-phase product, Heather replied. You use the first one for a week, the second one for five days, and the third one for one night. I just started the second one.

Okay, I answered. I supposed I couldve asked more about it, but her mood had been so high for the last week that I didnt want to discourage her. Besides, I was scheduled to go on a business trip in the morning and wouldnt be back for six days. I had a lot on my mind.

The next day, I kissed Heather goodbye and headed to the airport. It was a long, turbulent flight to London, and once I texted Heather that Id arrived safely, I took a taxi to the hotel and slept for 12 hours. Next on the schedule was meeting after meeting after meeting. It sucked, to be honest. 

I skyped with Heather a few times while I was gone, and every time I did, it seemed like shed be eating something. One day it was a burger. Another time it was a bowl of fettucine alfredo. Later it was a bag of chips. All stuff she wouldve *never* gone for before starting that weight loss plan.

On the last day I was in London, as we skyped and Heather ate out of a Ben and Jerrys container, I asked how the weight loss was going.

Its amazing!, she squealed, and lifted her shirt. I was dumbfounded. It looked like shed lost 20 pounds since Id left. Heather was never fat, but she always carried a little extra weight around her middle. Nothing any doctor would consider excessive and something pretty much any guy would prefer, just to be able to hold onto. But it was all gone. 

Are you sure you want to go through with that third phase of the lotion?, I asked. You look amazing as it is.

A cloud of disappointment crossed Heathers face. Just one more day, she said. I want to see it through. Besides, Ive been so damn hungry lately that Im worried Ill balloon up if I stop. 

I didnt have anything to say to that. If Id been eating like she apparently had, I wouldve put on ten pounds in the first day or two.

We said our goodbyes and I went to sleep. 

I arrived back home very late the following night. Heather was asleep, so I undressed in the dark and crept into bed. I could smell the new lotion on her. 

About twenty minutes after Id passed out, I felt Heathers hands on me. Rubbing. Groping. Id been quite a while since wed had anything even *resembling* sex, so I was ready right away. We rolled around for a little while, the slipperiness of her lotion adding a delicious, frictionless element to the mix.

She pulled herself on top of me and I felt her biting my lips and neck and ears before she whispered, I need to taste you and crawled down the bed. The ravenousness shed exhibited on our skype chats was nothing compared to the voraciousness she showed in the following minutes. I was helpless to do anything other than run my hands over her slippery back and thighs, and I marvelled at how thin shed gotten since the last time Id felt her.

Before long, I knew I had to stop her, so I pulled her up and kissed her mouth. She rode me as I felt the smooth slickness of her back and chest and butt; so much oily wetness and heat and hunger - I couldnt help myself. I lost myself in the moment.

When I finally regained a semblance of wherewithal, Heather was still on top of me. Still riding. I knew shed orgasmed at least twice, but she wouldnt let up. I was starting to get uncomfortable. Her silhouette in the dark room was so much slighter than it had been over the years wed been together. She looked like a new person. She felt like a new person. 

As she ground against me and mewled with mindless pleasure, I stared at her shape. In the dark, I couldnt make out details. But gradually, a cloud that had been occluding the moon moved away and I could see more. Just enough to realize something was very, very wrong.

I wrenched my arm backward and slapped the light switch near the nightstand. I screamed.

Heather still sat on top of me, grinding back and forth. Her skin was bright red and streaked with veins. 

No. It wasnt her skin. It was what had been behind her skin. The flesh was melting off her body. We were in a pool of it; greasy and pink and so terribly warm. Heather was sucking her thumb as she writhed against me, and I watched in horror as she pulled her finger from her mouth, peeled back the thumbnail, and dragged her front teeth across the meat on its underside. 

Im so hungry, she gasped. It feels so good to eat again.

Heather, stop!, I shouted, and went to push her off.

My hand passed right through the meat of her shoulder and I felt the bones dislocate. Rather than scream with pain, Heather groaned with hideous pleasure. She took her free hand and pinched her left nipple. It came off between her thumb and forefinger.

Panic overtook my desire to save my wife. I bucked my hips to get Heather away from me. It worked. I was able to get off the bed. Heather fell forward. As I scrambled for the phone to call 911, she turned on her side toward me. She was bleeding badly from her thighs; my push appeared to have caused major damage.

The dispatcher answered and I babbled while Heather studied me, her eyelids drooping before falling onto the bed like fleshy moths wings.

The 911 operator was saying something, but I couldnt hear what it was. Heather was talking to me. Her voice was weak.

Did...did I do a bad job Max? Do you not want me anymore? Am I ugl --

The word was cut off when her lower jaw fell from her face. Her tongue lolled before also dropping onto the sheets. Her eyes darted back and forth a few times, and then she was still.

I stared at the remains of Heather on our bed. Sirens pulsed in the distance. 

Youre not ugly, sweetheart, I whispered to her, tears cascading down my cheeks. Youll never be [ugly to me.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> As I sit here and hold my baby, I cant help but think back about how difficult my life was before she was in it. But things are so much better now. She was worth everything. Every little bit.

When youre expecting, the hardest part is the wait. You cant tell anyone for the first few months, just in case something terrible happens. Thats a lot to worry about, you know? After 12 weeks, you can break the news. In my case, though, I didnt. I was worried what people would think.

I wasnt married. I didnt have a job. I knew people would say that a baby would be irresponsible. But I wanted a baby. I needed one. The companionship would be so important - especially after Bobby left. The bastard.

A while earlier, I learned that the one friend I had, Katrina, was pregnant. She was overjoyed and glowing. Her life was perfect; a husband, a house, a career. Why she wanted to be my friend didnt make much sense to me, but I guess having grown up together really meant something to her. She told me about her baby the day she found out. Bad luck if youre superstitious. She wasnt, though. I was so happy for her.

Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months. Katrina was huge at eight months and wore clothing to show it off. I didnt want to show off anything. I wore baggy clothes and didnt like going out in public. I told a few family members Id be having a baby and the reaction was what Id feared: anger, disappointment, contempt. I never told Katrina. In fact, I made myself scarce. She hardly noticed. Must have been nice to have so much positivity in your life that you can forget your best friend.

I called Katrina a few weeks later and asked if she wanted to meet me for lunch. I was delighted when she told me she did. I prepared sandwiches and iced tea and waited for her to arrive. An hour later, she did. We sat and ate and talked about baby things. She told me shed just had a checkup and everything was going great. I expressed my happiness for her. And then, finally, did I let her in on my secret: I was going to have a baby of my own.

To say Katrina was surprised was an understatement. 

Oh my God, Julie, thats incredible! Our kids can grow up together and be best friends just like us! When are you due?

I grinned back and just said, any moment now.

A look of confusion flashed across Katrinas face, but her smile remained. But youre so tiny! How is that pos--

The smile was still there when I lunged.

A few minutes later, I was freeing my baby from where Katrina had kept her. She was so warm and perfect. In my excitement, Id sliced Katrina too deeply and my baby had a bad cut on her neck. It was fine as long as I kept a hand on the top of her head to stop her from looking up at the ceiling all the time. No worries. She was still there and she was mine. Finally mine. And even more beautiful than Id [expected.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> **April 2nd, 2017**
 
Either Im going to kill my husband for lying or whatevers growing in his mouth will do it for me. God only knows what that slut gave him on the night he didnt come home, but Ill be damned if Ill let him go to the doctor for it. The last thing our family needs is the nurses down at that clinic talking about how Jerrys been fucking around on me again. Ive got leftover penicillin from the infection he gave me two years ago. He can have that.

Listen, I know I sound cruel, but Jerrys on thin ice. Two weeks ago, he claimed he was coming home from the bar and all of a sudden he woke up in the woods 15 hours later. His truck was in a ditch on the side of the road. I called bullshit immediately. Heres what I know had to have happened: he was drunk, he picked up some chick at The Rooster, and they went into the woods to fuck. And now he caught something. Again.

Last time this happened - when he swore itd never happen again, mind you - it took a good long time for me to forgive him. He begged for another chance, so I gave it to him. But now Im fed up. Im not going to divorce him, but this is the last straw. He can sleep on the couch for the next 30 years for all I care.

And thats where hes been. On the couch.

Heres the issue: he does have something wrong with his mouth. That little slut he was with mustve given him something awful because the glands under his tongue are swollen pretty badly. He doesnt seem to be in much pain, but he slurs when he talks.

Im thinking I might cave and let him go to the clinic the next county over, but hes only been taking the penicillin for a few days. I think that stuff can take weeks to finally kick in, so hell have to suck it up. A little penance for thinking with his dick.

**April 6th, 2017**

Jerrys mouth is nasty. The swelling started to go down but the color under his tongue looks bad. Its bright red and the veins are really prominent. His breath could kill a horse, too. The guys at his job are making fun of him for catching something; he doesnt even try to defend himself about it anymore.

I almost feel bad for him when I hear all the tossing and turning on the couch while Im trying to sleep. Hes had some terrible nightmares since that night. Must be all the guilt. Well, he should feel guilty. God knows he wouldve given me what he got if I didnt realize hed been gone all night. He wouldve just rolled on top of me like everything was alright and wed both be in the same situation. No thank you!

**April 9th, 2017**

Something popped under Jerrys tongue overnight and theres yellow slime all over our pretty couch. He said hes very sorry and spent the morning trying to clean it off, but something tells me well be getting a new sofa before the year is out. 

The left side under his tongue isnt swollen anymore and Jerrys thinking about lancing the other side tonight, but now all he does is complain that the roof of his mouth is starting to hurt. I dont even want to think about what he did with that girl that night.

**April 10th, 2017**

I woke up to the sound of Jerry screaming. I ran downstairs and found him, stark naked, staring out the sliding glass doors that lead to the backyard. There was a terrible mess all over the floor and couch. The other area of swelling under his tongue mustve popped either by itself or with help from him, because there was that yellow stuff everywhere and it was mixed with blood. 

Ill admit, this was the first time I was actually worried about him. It wasnt the blood or the goo, but it was how he kept screaming even after I turned the light on and how he just stared out that door. To make matters worse, hed fingerpainted these things all over the glass. They looked like they could have been people, but the proportions were all off. I dont think Id ever been scared of a stick figure until right then.

I went over and unlocked the liquor cabinet and poured him a big drink. He took it from me and started to calm down after a few sips. It was the first drink I let him have since that night he didnt come home. I think he mustve had a beer or two after work in between now and then, but I havent seen him even buzzed. Hes been trying to be a good boy. Its gonna take more than that.
  
**April 12th, 2017**

I guess the penicillin did the job because the swelling in his mouth is all gone but he still says the roof hurts. Hes talking normally now and after that little scare last night, he slept like a baby. Good thing hes off work today - he got to sleep in.

We even watched a movie together after dinner. I could see his mouth moving as he poked his tongue around inside. Yuck.


**April 24th, 2017**  

Something really terrifying happened last night. Im trying to convince myself it was a nightmare but now Im here in the hospital waiting to hear whether or not my husband will be okay. I was sleeping and this super bright light started shining outside. Jerry started hollering right away and I jumped out of bed, but everything felt slow, like I was still asleep and trying to walk through deep water. Jerry screamed and screamed. As hard as I tried to move, everything took forever. By the time I got to the top of the stairs, I thought I saw shadows moving along the walls. Weird shapes and figures that reminded me of those things Jerry drew on the window that morning. None of it made sense.

Jerrys screams got drowned out by a loud, low humming that made the windows rattle. I got really dizzy and felt like I was going to fall, but when I tried to steady myself I realized I couldnt move at all. I was pinned in a standing position at the top of the steps. 

The low sound stopped and Jerrys shrieking filled my ears again. It sounded different this time. Muffled. The lights stopped and I regained control of my body. I stumbled down the stairs toward my husband, took one look at him, and called 911.

Ever since I arrived at the hospital with him, Ive been trembling. Whenever I blink, I still see it moving in his mouth. Writhing. Trying to get out.

[Will be continued.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Growing up, I was convinced Id be abducted by aliens. I lived in constant, sleep-deprived fear as every strange shadow and every reflection of light on the wall signified the beginning of what I knew would be my end. 

Logic told me the shadows were just piles of dirty clothes or my coat rack; that the reflections were just from passing cars on the street below. But logic fails in the face of terror. If it werent for my older brother, Jason, with whom I shared the bedroom, there was a very real chance I wouldve lost my mind.

I remember my 13th birthday with the same detached sense of helpless violation as a victim of sexual assault. The day itself had been fine. Pleasant, even. My parents, who were always caring and supportive, did their best to make sure my birthday was enjoyable. They knew I was stressed. They knew I was anxious. Id never told them why, though. Only Jason knew, and he promised to keep it a secret.

After the festivities, I went up to my room to play video games. I had two hours to play before lights-out. Jason sat on his immaculately-made bed, which was in stark contrast to my messy one, and watched, offering pointers as I died over and over.

Two hours went by quickly, and Dad came in to say it was time to go to sleep. He sat next to Jason on the bed and let me know he was proud of me; how Id been brave despite having a hard time and that things would get better. He wished me a happy birthday and kissed me goodnight, switching off the light on his way out of the room.

For a little while, I felt pretty good. Like I said, I never told my parents exactly what had been bothering me. Theyd ask every so often, but they wouldnt pry. They could tell I was struggling. I heard them cleaning up downstairs, comforted by the fact they were still awake and alert. With a sense of security I hadnt felt in a long time, I drifted off to sleep.

After a couple hours, I woke up and glanced at the clock. 11:26. I closed my eyes again. Before I could drift off to sleep, though, I noticed something. The room smelled bad. It wasnt a scent I could identify in the slightest - it was heavy and medicinal, but organic, too. Strange. Alien.

My eyelids lifted to the sight something shuffling toward my bed. I tried to shout and bolt away, but nothing worked. No movement, no sound. Only my eyes could receive my commands, and they stared, bulging out of my skull, as thing stood over my supine body.

I knew itd finally come to me; this was the day Id anticipated and dreaded for years. I tried to make out the features on its face. All I could pick up on was hideousness. Deformity. A head with its upper-left quadrant missing. A mouth with no lower mandible and a shriveled tongue lolling down to its skinny neck.

Robbie, it gurgled.

It knew my name. It had been studying me and it knew my name.

No more me, Robbie. No more me. Time to grow up.

Its head came down and touched my forehead with the remains of its upper lip. As it tilted, maggots tumbled out of the cratered skull and landed on my face. They squirmed and tumbled onto my pillow. I felt them writhing against my ears and the sides of my neck.

Ill miss you.

It turned and walked toward Jasons bed. I tried over and over to scream as panic suffused the entirety of my being; the dark world around me blurred and I knew I was going to pass out. I knew I was going to fail my brother and not be able to warn him before the creature reached him. Before I lost consciousness - before I passed into a dreamless morass of black - I hated myself for being so useless. For being so weak.

My mothers shrill, panicked shriek catapulted me back into reality. The room was bright. It was morning. Mom stood over Jasons bed wailing and sobbing and I heard Dad thundering across the hall from their bedroom. He burst into the room and immediately saw what Mom did. I watched his knees tremble, as if he were about to fall.

I didnt move. Everything from the night was coming back and I knew - I was certain - Jason was dead. My big brother was gone. The certainty was overwhelming and searing tears of leaked down my cheeks onto the pillow. Something wriggled against my neck. I gasped and leapt to my feet.

Everything went slowly for the next few minutes.

I turned and saw the ring of maggots around my head print on the pillow. Dad was crossing the room to take me in his arms when he saw the bugs on my pillow and in my hair and whispered, oh my God. He picked me up. He hadnt done that in years.

I rode out of the room in his strong arms. Dont look at your brothers bed, he ordered. I couldnt help myself. I looked as we exited. One glance was all I needed.

Jasons body was on the bed. He was wearing a stained and dirt-encrusted blue suit. Oh no, I thought to myself, as I took in his injuries: the torn lower mandible. The caved-in skull. The desiccated, green-gray skin that was mostly gone.

Moms wracking sobs had escalated to hysterical screaming. As Dad and I rounded the corner and headed downstairs, we heard her shouting, how did you come back? Why are you here? Who did this?

Dad whispered in my ear as we walked. Its okay sweetheart. Its okay. We dont know who did it, but its going to be all right. Its not your brother anymore. Its just the body he doesnt need. Hes still in heaven, okay? Hes still in heaven.

I started to shake and Dads voice cracked with emotion as he spoke those last words. Hes in heaven. It sounded horribly, horribly familiar. I closed my eyes and saw a coffin. I saw my parents standing next to it, sobbing. I saw a large, framed picture of Jason and a room full of friends and family.

But I also saw the toys I was playing with. And I saw Jason sitting next to me. We played while everyone else cried. He grinned and said, Dont be upset, Robbie. Ill be here to help while you grow up. You dont have to feel sad.

My aunt, Lindsay, came up to me and stood in the exact same spot where Jason was sitting. I remember thinking it was strange she could do that, and then she knelt down and said, hes in heaven before walking back to my cousins and uncle. Jason winked at my confused face, then we kept playing with our toys.

Jason died, I whispered to Dad.

He nodded and I watched as he eyed the muddy footprints from the back door which led up the down the hall and up the stairs to my room.

You were probably too young to remember, but he loved you so, so much.

I thought back to all the fun wed had in our room over the years, all leading up to the video games on my 13th birthday the night before.

Youre the same age he was now, Dad said, and tears freely flowed down into his beard. Youre all grown up.

Something from the previous night buzzed in my ear. No more me, Robbie. No more me. Time to grow up.

And then it clicked. And my screams joined those of my mother in a [terrible, dissonant chorus.](http://unsettlingstories.com) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm telling you, you haven't gotten jerked off until you've had your hog tugged by someone with triphalangeal thumb syndrome. I knew this chick named Betsy who had hilarious thumbs like this; even if you were blindfolded, you would know right away if those were her hands on your cock.

She'd go up and down and it'd feel so good. I swear, it'd take all my concentration not to dump a load on those long-ass thumbs right away. But I'd keep my composure and she'd keep going - up and down and around and around. She'd spit, she'd change direction, and she'd even talk dirty. She was one filthy girl.

At the end of it all, when she was looking for a Dunkin Donuts napkin to wipe herself off, I'd make small talk. I'd talk about the weather, the stock market, and even politics. She didn't want to say much. She was always concerned about getting a ride home. Apparently it's really hard to hitchhike when people driving by think you're just pointing in the same direction they're going. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Jan and I got there seconds after it happened. People were still shouting with surprise and dismay. The body lay in tatters on the tracks.

Oh God, Jan whispered. That poor man.

What happened? I asked the guy next to me.

Suicide, the guy said. He hopped off the platform right when the train was coming by.

Christ, I muttered. I wondered what our options were. Thered obviously be a delay while the police and paramedics attended to the scene. From the looks of it, Jan and I were going to be late for our friends wedding in New York that evening; people were already scooping up the remaining taxis to take to their destinations. It looked like wed be stuck there for a while.

There was a Dunkin Donuts on the platform and I suggested to Jan that we go in and wait until everything was cleaned up. She agreed.

I sipped coffee while Jan picked at a bagel without eating it. The police had just arrived. They draped the mans torso and head with a cloth, but his legs were still uncovered. They were about 10 and 15 feet from the torso, respectively. Whatever blood there was had been soaked up by the gravel between the tracks. Still, there were spatters on the platform and nearby structures, including the window of the Dunkin Donuts. An employee went out a couple minutes later and wiped it off.

I watched the cleanup on the tracks and Jan texted our other wedding-bound friends. She mumbled something about not being in the mood to see a bunch of happy people after having to look at a dead body. I wasnt paying much attention to her, though. I was staring at the cloth covering the dead mans torso.

It had moved.

At first, I thought it was just the wind. It wasnt. It obviously wasnt. Just one small location on the cloth was jutting upward and then pulling back. From the looks of it, no one else had noticed.

Then a cop did. 

Hey, he shouted to one of the guys from the coroners office, who was working on collecting one of the legs.

Jan, look at the cloth covering the guy, I instructed. She looked up.

The coroner glanced at the cop, who was pointing at the cloth. The coroner frowned.

The cloth jerked up hard and the coroner placed the leg back down on the tracks. I watched his mouth form the words, what the fuck?

He walked to the cloth and pulled it off. He was standing between me and the torso, but he backed away quickly after and I saw what he did. What the fuck?, I mimicked.

A thin, wiry thing was flopping back and forth out of a hole in the dead mans back. Someone who looked like a boss yelled to get away, and everyone on the tracks hopped back onto the platform. 

The thing flapped and writhed against the mans bloody back. Jan was pleading with me to leave, but I couldnt tear my eyes away. More and more of it poured out of the mans body. Three feet. Five feet. Ten. Twenty. It slapped against the tracks and gravel as if it were being electrocuted; more and more and more ejected itself from the corpse until it was free.

Two of the cops had their guns pointed at it, but their boss was yelling at them not to fire. A guy from Dunkin Donuts was recording the whole thing was his phone. Jan was green and huffing and puffing the way she does right when shes about to throw up.

The creature on the tracks looked like it was trying to move away from the body, but it almost seemed to be tangled up in itself. It writhed for another minute, then jerked three or four times, then lay still.

Tentatively, one of the cops approached it, gun drawn. The thing didnt move much. It twitched a little, but if my guess was any good, I wouldve said it was dead. The boss on the platform said something to the cop, who got closer. He kicked the worm. It flopped flaccidly against the tip of his shoe. In the glare of the setting sun, I watched a wet patch appear on his shoe. It might have just been the light, but i couldve sworn I saw that wet patch crawl up to his sock.

The coroner came over with a much bigger cloth, which he threw over the thing. Another order from the boss, then the cops began to clear everyone from the platform. We were asked to leave the Dunkin Donuts.

Jan pestered me to have an Uber bring us from New Brunswick to the wedding in New York, and $200 later, we were at the wedding. And that was that.

I didnt read anything about the creature on the tracks in the paper, although I did see something about the suicide. Just a normal guy named Juan Cordero, apparently. Nothing remarkable.

The one thing I did find remarkable, though, was what I read in the paper a few months later. Its why Im writing this in the first place. When I was going through the paper last week, I saw a story about a police officer whod committed suicide on the steps of the police station a couple days earlier. Apparently thered been a pretty big disturbance after, but the paper didnt give any details. 

I didnt recognize the cops name, but the picture was familiar. It was the same one whod kicked the worm thing and had gotten the stuff on his shoe. As for the disturbance after, I can only guess. But itd be a [pretty good guess.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TITLE> A Weekend of Red Clouds and Hazmat Suits </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-06 00:50:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last weekend, we werent allowed to leave our home. Hazmat-suited men were everywhere and kept insisting it was for our own safety. They wouldnt give us a hint about what was going on.

Being right across the street, I stayed glued to my front window. It was fascinating at first. Then interesting. Then tedious. Still, I felt like I had to keep watching. There was something going on in there and I needed to know what. Nothing on television gave any indication something was wrong. Our cell phones had no service. It was as if the signals were being blocked.

Toward the end of the first day, Id started to feel a surprising amount of apprehension. My wife, too. It felt as if we were about to receive terrible news, despite not having any reason to.

Another hour passed as we moped around the front room, frequently glancing toward the window at the commotion across the street.

Around 8pm, the sound started. It was low but intense. We felt it in our stomachs and teeth. Everything in the house rattled. A portrait of Lucy and me on our wedding day fell off the wall, shattering the glass frame. Our dog, Pupper, yelped from his hiding place under the sofa.

Outside, hazmat-suited people poured from the neighbors house. They huddled behind the trucks parked alongside the property line and waited. 

The sound intensified. I could feel my teeth throbbing in their sockets and Pupper ran around in circles, barking and panicking. A vile smell filled the room. It had not been produced by any of us.

A red, miasmal cloud seeped from the doors and windows of the house across the street. I felt panic rising in my chest and instinctively brought my shirt up to cover my nose and mouth. My wife did the same. I picked up Pupper and carried him into the upstairs bathroom and placed him in the tub. It was his favorite place whenever he was scared, but I also hoped hed be safer. The house shook like it had been hit by a truck. More objets fell from walls and cabinets.

Back downstairs, Lucy yelled, you have to see this! I galloped down the steps and pressed my face against the window.

A massive crack had formed in my neighbors front yard. I couldnt tell how deep it was from where I was standing, but from the way the hazmat guys approached it, I got the impression it was very deep indeed.

Beside me, Lucy slumped over. Before any concern or alarm could register, everything went dark.

Hours passed without either of us seeing or feeling anything.

Lucy was the first to wake up and the sound of her throwing up roused me soon after. I felt okay before opening my eyes, but the moment I did I felt overwhelming nausea. My head spun. The room spun. Everything spun. I slammed my hands over my eyes and the dizziness went away.

Close your eyes, I yelled to Lucy. Upstairs, I heard Pupper retching and whimpering. 

Lucy sobbed and stumbled around blindly as I narrowed my eyes into slits and tried to see what lay behind the front window. There were shapes I recognized. The orange, hazmat-suited men walked around the crevasse and in and out of the neighbors house.

The red mist that had poured from the windows and doors appeared to have congealed and fallen on the lawn and bushes and street. The men walked through it with some difficulty, as if it were tacky. The smell was still there, but less powerful. 

All this was glimpsed through narrowed, bleary eyes. Nothing was sharp. Nothing was focused. Any attempt to properly resolve anything beyond the distance of my nose resulted in another bout of acute nausea. Behind my confusion - behind my churning stomach and roiling bowels - lurked a profound, primal fear. It was a feeling that there was something outside our home that didnt want to be seen. 

Pupper cried from the room above us and Lucy crawled on her hands and knees up the stairs to try to comfort him. Outside, I heard shouting. Without thinking, I widened my eyes and tried to look. An astonishing wave of sickness swept through me and I collapsed to the ground, cradling my knees to my chest, as my stomach contents drooled from my mouth.

The shouts became frantic, but I was too weak to move. Colors shimmered before my eyelid-cloaked eyes and I yelled to Lucy and Pupper to stay upstairs. Lucy said okay. The floor vibrated as men outside screamed. The nausea returned even with my eyes shut and I gasped at the ferocity of it. A hideous, droning buzz filled the air. Again, my consciousness left me.

When I woke up, it was still light out. I shouted up to Lucy, and she muttered something. I heard her and Pupper starting to move around in the bathroom. With a great deal of trepidation, I opened my eyes. Nothing happened. I felt fine.

I lifted myself to my feet and looked around. The house was a mess - it looked as if there had been an earthquake. Books and magazines and dishes and glasses were strewn everywhere. Cold air poured out of the broken front window.

I looked outside and didnt quite understand what I was seeing at first. The gash in the ground had closed and now resembled an ugly scar. But my neighbors house was gone. Simply gone. The street and yard were still covered in the unidentifiable, red substance.

Not a single person in a hazmat suit could be seen.

I checked my phone. For the first time all weekend, it had service. To my disbelief, it was already Monday. Whatever had happened on Sunday morning had knocked us out for 24 hours. I dialed 911. The operator told me, very pleasantly, that they had received calls from my neighbors and emergency services were on their way.

That part was true. The police, fire department, and ambulances arrived shortly after my call.

We were told on Tuesday that there had been a chemical spill. That a truck had taken a detour down our street and had, inexplicably, leaked. The substance reacted with something the house and exploded and thankfully Mr. Davidson wasnt home or else he would have been killed. I knew it was bullshit. All of us did. But we had no evidence to prove it was anything else.

The spill had been all but cleaned up by Wednesday. Lucy and I did our best to clean the house up and repair the damages. We still feel lingering effects of whatever had made us so sick. That smell still sits in the air as a reminder of what happened, whatever it was. We want to forget it all.

Its not easy, though.

Its not just the smell. Its the memories. Its the missing house. Its our poor Pupper, who hasnt been the same since. Its lots of things.

But most of all, its the people whove showed up at night. People Ive never seen before. People who, until theyre physically threatened with violence by one of the neighbors, wont get out of the road or lawn across the street. People who congregate in circles and chant and yelp in dim candlelight. People who spend the hours dragging their tongues across the areas thatd been covered in the [red slime](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> I think everyone knows by now that the easiest way to get a huntsman spider to stop coming in your house is to flip it over and suck its dick. 

Hear me out.

Carry a spatula around and when you see one, flip it onto its back. They're surprisingly docile once they're in that position. Then, all you need to do is gently press on its abdomen to retract its penis. It will be small; approximately the size of a thin pencil eraser. Use the tip of your tongue to manipulate it to full erection, then suck with your lips until it ejaculates; usually 30-45 minutes later. If you don't feel the rush of semen, you will know by its legs scratching playfully at your face when it gets oversensitive afterwards.

The main trick is not to swallow the spider semen. Trust me, I know it will be tempting. But no, pick up the spider and let him outside, then drool its ejaculate material near the entrances to your house. Spiders are highly promiscuous, and its semen mixed with your saliva will signal him to move on to another house. Spiders do NOT like to get their dick sucked by the same person twice.

<TEXT> Those ridges are the best! All you need to do is find someone to hook their top front teeth under one of the ridges and pull back! Just have them apply some pressure from the bottom with their tongue and the whooooole thing will just slough off, no problem. 

If you look right where the nail meets the toe, there's some discoloration. That's where the flavor pocket is hidden. After the nail's off, get them to suck the juice out of that pocket. If you're lucky and they're not super selfish, they'll kiss you while it's still in their mouth. There's really nothing like a sticky toenail juice kiss. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know a lot of people think this is a joke because it's fake, but there is a culture in South America that cultivates blemishes like this for certain culinary purposes.

One of the tricks is to keep the area well oiled; adolescents will collect their facial oils using specific, spongy leaves and then squeeze the oil into a communal jug. Nightly, that oil will be applied to the facial area of the person who will be contributing their blemish.

Once the blemish, usually a pimple or abscess, is grown, a village elder will perform a ceremonial squeezing onto a slab of maize bread. That bread will be consumed by pregnant women to, according to tribal lore, increase the likelihood of them birthing a male child.

If there aren't any pregnant women, the squeezing product will be distributed among the men of the tribe by the elder, who sucks the product from the blemish and drools it into the mouths of the virile tribesmen.

I love cultural anthropology.

*Edit: guys, just because it's a cultural practice you disagree with doesn't mean you have a right to downvote it. That's intolerance.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only thing worse than that is how they used to cure it in the old days. Human saliva is remarkably potent as a disinfectant, so they'd have someone, usually someone from a lower class, drag his top teeth around the edges of the wound to collect whatever is growing there. 

From that point, the chosen person would keep what he collected in his mouth, milk his salivary glands, and mix together the pus and skin and saliva until a paste was formed. Once the consistency was right, he'd carefully drool the mix around the wound and allow it to sit and disinfect. 

They'd repeat the process between 12 and 30 times an hour until the wound was free of infection. I've gone to numerous hospitals to volunteer, since I know old remedies like leeches and stuff are coming back. They haven't been interested in my methods, though. They're never interested :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always wanted to suck one of those like it was a dick. Not in a dirty or inappropriate way, mind you. More like an act of love or compassion. I'd know I was doing a good job when those little feelers scraped against my tonsils, almost like they were begging me to go on. I'd run my hand over its length and stroke as my tongue worked up a sheen of saliva over its surface.

After a little while, I'd feel it start to squirm and twitch. It's mouth would open against the back of my throat and all the feelers would get vibrate really quickly, then stiffen, as if it were orgasming.

Of course, it wouldn't be, because it had just died from not being in the water for the length of the blowjob. But I still think, somewhere deep inside, it was happy that's how it all had to end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dated a woman who would do that. Thankfully, she was often willing to share. I swear to God, there's nothing better than being forced to lay supine as she wiggles her toes over your face, forcing you lift your head and back off the ground in an attempt to get her foot in your mouth.

It's worth the effort, though. If you're lucky, you'll catch her big toe between your teeth and bite, gently of course, but hard enough so she knows you mean business. You can suck the toe into your mouth, manipulate it with your tongue, and trace its nail along your gum line.

This woman I mentioned knew I was fond of what she grew between her toes and at the bottom of her foot. It wasn't a crust, but more of a flaky, fungal colony. It took some time to scrape it off, but my efforts were rewarded when the mycological gift settled on my tongue and dissolved in my saliva. In a two hour session, she could fill my mouth entirely.

On my birthday, she let me kiss her while it was still stuffed between my cheeks and gums. She sucked it out, then we snowballed the contents back and forth for a good ten minutes while she pinched the head of my penis with a ferocity I never knew she had in her, but I enjoyed it immensely. But yeah, this reminded me of that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Sprouts </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My sunflower seeds started talking to me last month. I couldnt believe it; Id been lonely for such a long time. It felt good to have friends. I bet it was my mom who asked them to keep me company. I miss her terribly.

The clearest memory I have of Mom was when she told me that all the beauty in the world grows from something small. I was helping her in the garden, and wed just planted sunflowers. My favorite. A couple days later, she showed me the tiny, burgeoning sprouts that would eventually become the towering, yellow flowers I loved so much. She repeated what she told me about beauty. I remember being amazed. Id wake up every morning and head outside and check their progress. Each time, they were a little bit bigger.

Then there was an accident. A bad one.

After that, I didnt have a mom anymore.

Dad and I scattered her ashes in the garden right when the sunflowers were at their most radiant.

It took years for me to realize how much Moms death had affected me. I just thought I was a sad person in general, since Id known the feeling for so long. It didnt cross my mind that Id been traumatized and might need help beyond basic counseling. By the time I considered it, I was pretty far gone.

The sunflower seeds started talking at an important time for me. Id lost all hope of being happy again. Dad and I didnt speak. I had no friends. I spent all my time alone in my bedroom, wishing I was anywhere else. Anyone else.

Id developed a bad habit of using a pushpin to make small cuts and punctures in my arms and legs. They made me feel just a little bit better, but I still cried whenever I did it. On that special day, after a particularly painful cut, I heard the chorus of small voices coming from the table:

Dont be sad.

I jumped. I was alone in the house. Dad was working his first shift and still had another one to go. He wouldnt be home for another 14 hours. Again:

Dont be sad. Its a beautiful day outside!

A small package of sunflower seeds sat on the surface of my desk. They were a snack Id bought on the last day of school. Id eaten a handful that afternoon and forgotten about them. Theyd been sitting there for a week.

I wiped my eyes and stood over the desk. Inside the plastic, I could see all the sunflower seeds standing up.

Hi Rachel!

I jumped again. The seeds wiggled in their bag, almost like they were waving. Confused curiosity overcame my alarm. I assumed I was going crazy. Sunflower seeds dont talk to sane people. But they were talking to me. There was something comforting about them, too. Something familiar. I felt a wave of bittersweet nostalgia.

The sting of the cut on my upper arm brought me back to reality. It was about as deep as the pushpin was long. A thin rivulet of blood drooled down to my elbow. It was so ugly.

Almost on cue with the thought, the sunflower seeds began to comfort me.

Oh Rachel, its not ugly. It was just a mistake!

Dont worry - it will heal and youll forget all about it!

Their kind words were in stark contrast to the wound. Its edges were puffy and red, making it look angry. And it hurt. A lot. I didnt know how something so small could be so hideous. From the desk below, the seeds continued their praise and support.

Amid the voices and my own considerable confusion and discomfort, an old memory resurfaced - one Id kept below the surface for over ten years.

All the beauty in the world grows from something small.

The sentence echoed within my mind, bouncing and twirling and floating, as I considered its meaning and implications . The sunflower seeds watched my contemplation in silence. A minute later, I knew. I reached to pick one up as the rest of them burst into cheers of joy. I inspected the seed for a moment, then pushed it into the puncture as far as it would go.

A sensation of blissful contentment unlike anything Id ever experienced suffused through me. My eyes closed. Behind my eyelids, I was four years old again. Mom stood in front of me, beautiful and tall in her shorts and tank top and gardening gloves. Her smile shone down as she spoke her poignant, memorable words, and pointed her gloved fingers at the barely-visible sprouts pushing out of nourishing soil.

I lifted my eyelids to the sight of a plain, gray seed poking from the raised edges of my puncture wound like an engorged tick. Before I could tell myself how ugly it was, I stopped. I remembered what Mom said. The seeds on the desk cheered louder.

Two long, summer days went by. I spoke to the seeds and they spoke back. We made plans together. We talked about the future. Id covered the one in my arm with a piece of gauze. On the morning of the third day, the seeds asked me to take off the bandage. I did with trepidation, which turned out to be entirely misplaced. Inside the swollen, wrinkled edges of the puncture, a tiny, fragile sprout lay curled. When the light from the room hit the sprout, it slowly stood. It was indescribably beautiful.

Feeling better than Id ever felt, I stabbed the pin into myself over and over and over. Arms, legs, belly, shoulders. The only tears I shed were ones of happiness. I planted each seed with diligence and care. Days went by.

The hundred-or-so holes in me grew wider as the seeds sprouted and grew. I sat on my bed in front of the window to make sure they got enough sun. I heard Dad come and go from his jobs, leaving food for me without ever knocking or saying hello. I was grateful; I didnt want to be bothered.

Seed-sized holes became fingertip-sized holes. Fingertip-sized holes became quarter-sized holes. They all leaked, and none smelled particularly good. I remembered how Mom had used fertilizer in the garden that smelled terrible. It was always worth it.

I stopped keeping track of the days and only concentrated on the sprouts. They were all healthy and growing. All but one near my navel. It had turned brown and was wilting. The other sprouts told me it couldnt be saved. Id have to remove it or else theyd all get sick.

I started the process of pulling the foot-long plant out of my abdomen. I felt and heard ripping sounds as the roots were torn from within. The pain was immense. When it was all done, there was a shallow hole in my belly the size of my palm. It was streaked with white and yellow paste that smelled terrible. I spent some time wiping it away. Afterward, all the sprouts thanked me.

Another long period passed by. Maybe a month. I woke up today to the first blossom on one of the sprouts. It was the tallest of them all, sticking out almost three feet from my shoulder. All the days leading up to this, I felt excitement. Today, though, Im too weak to feel anything.

It took almost an hour for me to get out of bed. I looked at myself in the mirror. I was home to nearly 80 healthy plants, all between one and three feet tall. Root systems under my skin ran in complex patterns, bringing nourishment to the heavy, healthy sunflower stalks. We had a long conversation as I sat, barely able to eat the breakfast Dad had left for me. We came to an agreement.

Im using the last bit of energy I have to write this. When Im done, Ive agreed to go out and sleep in the garden. I cant believe I spent years feeling sad. Feeling ugly. Feeling like I didnt have a purpose. Even though Mom died when I was young, shed told me all I needed to know in one, perfect sentence.

Now Im going to go out and sleep in the same soil she used to bring beauty in the world. The soil where shes slept for the last ten years. I get to be with her again, and the world gets a new crop of sunflowers. Beautiful things that grow from something small. Just like [me](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> My buddy learned that the hard way. The hooker's name was Marissa; we should've known it'd be trouble just from spelling her name backward. Well, my buddy's really into oral sex so he started licking in and around, fairly confident in Marissa's cleanliness. One thing led to another and he told her to sit on his face. He was going to town and lickin' and lappin'. Everyone was having a great time.

Until he wasn't. Marissa was brought to orgasm. When an orgasm happens, there's a lot of muscle contraction and relaxation in the pelvic area. It turned out Marissa had been with a bunch guys earlier in the day and they'd, well, finished up in the other spot. One particularly strong muscle spasm later and he was cleaning the leavings of nine guys and the detritus from last night's taco salad from his forehead.

Anyway, yeah.

That said, if I had to fuck a duck, I would absolutely choose to fuck a Mandarin duck. They're so beautiful and pure. I bet they would be gentle, kind lovers who cared more about my pleasure than their own. It's honestly vulgar to call what we'd do "fucking," because it sounds too raw. Too primal. No, we would make love. Our act would be one of beauty and sweetness; enjoying one another in silence broken only by gentle sighs and whispered, joy-filled quacks.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just learned the horrible, impossible truth about a drug called adrenochrome. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-03 18:21:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Please help.

Someone close to me may be connected to the disappearance and murder of countless children; most of them refugees or otherwise disadvantaged - all untraceable. All forgettable. And now, all dead. 

He told me about a drug called adrenochrome that could produce a high beyond any other. And unlike those other drugs, there are no ill effects. Quite the contrary; there are substantial benefits from consuming it: greater health, increased vivacity, and a host of other, smaller effects. Combine those with an intense sense of euphoria and you have a substantial demand.

The issue is this: it is a derivative of the chemicals produced by the human body when it is under intense, immeasurable fear.

My former friend, who confessed his involvement during a fleeting crisis of conscience, insisted this was true and cited a number of dubious-looking studies and fake news sites. But then there were the photos.

He didnt allow me to make copies for fear of implicating himself personally, but hed been to a farm, he called it, in one of the Baltic states. There were photos of countless people, all seemingly under the age of 15. They were naked and chained to tables and walls and floors in a windowless room the size of a football stadium. I couldnt estimate how many there were.

As he scrolled through the photographs and I debated killing him, I saw masked men hovering over the victims and torturing them. As they were being tortured, their blood was being drained into containers.

Other photos showed the production facilities - enormous rooms that looked like chemistry labs where the blood was filtered and the compounds were extracted.

The worst, though, were the mass graves.

Men stood around them and laughed as they unloaded truckloads of carcasses into pits. They used pitchforks to gather up anyone who had been left behind. 

I asked him why he was allowed to take these pictures. He said no one would believe it was happening. And hes been right.

Rumors about facilities like this have been around for decades. Journalists have tried to report on it, only to be laughed out of their editors offices. One journalist, a Swede, came the closest to bringing it into the mainstream. He died, along with his family, in a hideous house fire.

Listen to me: the pictures I saw were not faked. They were not staged. They were, without any doubt, real.

And theres one more thing. One more picture. Believe it if you want, I dont care. I need to get this off my chest.

There was an image of adrenochrome users. 

I dont know what I expected. Well, I guess I do: strung out, gaunt, miserable-looking addicts with despair and desperation in their eyes. Its what weve all associated with drug users thanks to heroin and crack and whatnot.

This was different.

The image was of a lavish conference room in a skyscraper. Where, I could not determine. Syringes of the drug were sitting on gilded plates on a thick table of polished wood. 

I recognized the faces sitting around that table.

World leaders. Entertainers. Religious icons. All grinning. All happy. All ready for their injection.

Seeing those familiar faces was the initial shock. It wasnt the final one.

On the far side of the table, almost too small to be seen but still unmistakable, was an iconic head of state. A recent one. He was laughing as he reached for his syringe, but there was something unusual about his hand. It wasnt its normal, small, pink self. It was green. 

It was webbed.

It was clawed.

<TEXT> So, um, remember when [I told you about the baby Im gonna have](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5myi34/haha_guys_my_parents_think_im_a_virgin_but_im/?st=iyg3pogo sh=e228bfcc)? Me too, lol. Its gonna be so great. Oh but yeah thats not why Im sad.

You know how my parents arent really ever around and stuff? Yeah, it turns out they like...stopped living? Like a while ago? And Ive been living with foster parents for like a year? 

Haha no jk theyre fine but theyre on vacation lol. Its cool they know how mature I am and let me be alone and watch [my stupid brother](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5c2xzz/ok_now_my_brother_is_all_messed_up_and_gross_lol/?st=ixqaar4v sh=33e9ea48) even though [my dumb sister](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4ho869/um_can_any_of_you_guys_tell_me_whats_wrong_with/?st=ivbamqdh sh=d65e3411) got all dead and stuff. But yeah heres why Im sad. And no, its not [poor gay Kevin](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5i4e1h/omg_guys_why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_a_boyfriend/?st=ixqab4ot sh=30c286c6) (I call him Gaykev now.)

I promised my parents Id go to church on Wednesday night and I did thank you very much. I walked all the way over there and went down all those flights of stairs and sat at mass for five hours until the Gift stopped bleeding. And breathing lol. 

I told some of the other people at church about the baby but it seemed like they already knew about the baby and I was like um okay so why are you asking how Im doing when you know Im awesome because Im having a baby that you already know about for some reason. Yuck. The Hierophant was nice and he gave me a hug once he washed all the Gifts blood off his hands haha I said I didnt mind but he wanted to be polite because I have really pretty hair.

Anyway yesterday I went to talk to Gaykev about the baby and see if he wants to make out or something just to practice because boys have mouths not too different from girls. Not as pretty as mine though lol. Dont send me more messages pervs.

So Gaykevs brain is getting a little better so he drooled pretty intelligently for someone with a lot of missing brain and said something like ummmmmmmmmmfffff when I asked about being a daddy so I took that as a yes and started kissing him. Did you know that drool tastes like a mouth? I guess it kinda makes sense but I never really thought about it but yeah drool is all mouthy.

But guys heres why Im sad: I think Gaykev stayed gay because he didnt really get into it except to drool a lot more. He didnt say ANYTHING about wanting to be Katnisss daddy. I didnt want anyone to think I got rejected so I just pushed him away and said not to touch me anymore. No one noticed. It was nice.

But Im still sad. I dont want Katniss to grow up without a daddy in her life. Sure, that gray man who put Katniss up me is technically her dad and theres always Black God and even my dumb aunt is all about this Bill Lemarie or something guy but its not the same. 

Gaykev is such daddy material. Unf.

Btw my aunt is REALLY annoying. I get it - my uncle was sad and had to go out on a boat and die all slow and stuff. But h*ck, Aunt Lisa, why do you have to be all dramatic about it? Like, we have Gaykevs for that type of thing. Theres really nothing artsy about what you do so how about like you just stop being so drama llamay and just move on lol. Its so not attractive, like, youll never get another uncle for me that way.


Yeah Katniss is kinda pushing at the inside of my eyes now which is kinda cute but tickles a lot and makes stuff blurry for a little while. Its like looking into a glass thats filled with corn syrup or Gaykev drool or something not that I ever collected it and drank it haha.

So yeah one more interesting thing that youre gonna read because you think Im sweet and adorbs. The Hierophant was at my doorstep first thing this morning when I went out to go to school OMG HOLD ON

Guys I totally realized while I was writing this that I hadnt fed Tommy since my parents left and, like, UGH WHY IS IT SO EASY TO ACCIDENTALLY KILL LITTLE KIDS SO ANNOYING.

So the Hierophant was there and he touched my forehead in front of where little Katniss was sleeping and then asked me to take a bite out of something that was kinda cold and meaty and had veins in it. But I felt pretty good after.

Ok I have to go do something about Tommy or else Im going to get in a lot of trouble. But Im not sad anymore now that I got all this out. Ill ttyl losers haha no youre not really losers except for[ all of you](http://unsettlingstories.com) who totally are.

<TEXT> *Under every scrap of confining skin is the potential for escape. When life grows from your husk, you, in turn, may be reborn.* -William James Lemaire: Seeding the Verdant World

It had been so, so long since my soulmate had felt anything resembling escape. 

We sat and talked about the process that would surely end his life. Our Benefactor, William, had proposed this journey to us at our final meeting. William, whod given so much of his time and energy to the wretched around him, was generous in imparting his wisdom. He believed my soulmate could be saved - but only if he gave his life to the Verdant World. I remember looking at the swaying trees and long grass around us - trees and grass seeded by the numberless Saved. It was a defining moment.

*Grow what we love in whom you love.* -William James Lemaire: Seeding the Verdant World

I kissed the lips of my soulmate before removing them. He didnt move. Tears sprouted from the corners of his closed eyes. The sweet taste of his kiss lingered as I poured honey in and around his new mouth. The honey was from bees which had pollinated the flowers grown from other Saved. The cycle was continuing with us. We whirl the wheel.

The tranquility of the pond was a gift from the Benefactors before William. Birds sang, bees buzzed, crickets chirped, my soulmate bled.

Before each cut, he nodded his assent. I needed to know this was what he wanted. It was. This was the most important moment of his short life - a chance for redemption. A chance to prove he loved the world which birthed him. A chance, finally, to show appreciation after a lifetime of inescapable sadness.

To be sad was to mock the gifts of the Benefactors.

*Float as one, return to shore as many.* -William James Lemaire: Seeding the Verdant World

With my soulmate open and honeyed, I set him adrift on the small raft in the tranquil pond. Birds sang, bees buzzed, crickets chirped, and all lit upon the wounds of my love.

For weeks, I stayed with him on the muddy edge of the pond. Once each morning, I would pull the rope on his raft to bring him to shore. I fed him milk and honey as I inspected his wounds.

His mouth and nostrils bore new life.

His open chest bore new life.

His pierced belly bore new life.

His split thighs bore new life.

During our morning times of closeness, I urged him to speak. His refusals came in the form of a soft gurgling and a shake of his head. Not too hard a shake; he didnt want to disturb that which developed inside him. 

He was growing larger by the day - purple streaks stained his sun-charred skin which now stretched and wept. It wouldnt be much longer.

*On the day of escape, let there be great joy as the air and the water and the soil are rejuvenated. Venerate the husk as you would a flower, for it contains the Seeds of Ignition.* -William James Lemarie: Seeding the Verdant World

My soulmate burst and passed away on the 16th day of his journey. From his body came new life. Eyes that once stared at a world he believed to be bereft of joy now bore sunflowers: proof of the good we had done.

I left him, open to the Verdant World, and went on. 

New birds sang to Black God, new bees buzzed to Black God, new crickets chirped to Black God. 

The wheel remains [whirling](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> Bodies in bodies.

Bodies of bodies.

True knowledge requires self destruction. Id always preached it, but Id never practiced it. Never, until this morning, when the red wire slipped into the black module and I moved while going nowhere. My consciousness - my essence - erupted from my body and left me standing in that busy room of machines and batteries and magic.

(Magic is nothing without machines and batteries.) 

I left my body without looking back. The air was smoky and shimmering. The walls were porous. No sound met my earless nothingness. There was only sight. My third eye; my soul; my angel: my guide. My everything. 

I traversed the room and slipped through the wall. 

I hung over a city street of hideousness and chaos. To see the universe as it truly is, as hideousness and chaos, was to experience great validation. Goodness and order are fleeting aberrations. Chaos overpowers, seething and miasmatic.

A gaping grin gashed the sky above. Through it, shapes poured. 

To travel is to understand shapes that would be invisible and incomprehensible when shackled within a body. Shapes of countless dimensions. Shapes of colors so far beyond natural spectra that they registered as flavors on the tongue Id left behind. Shapes are the devils of our nature.

I floated down to street level. The ground was translucent and fragile. Shapes twisted and writhed through foundational pores, paying no mind to the matter I once believed to be solid. I followed one, a pinched, non-Euclidian phantasm of impossible proportions, into my home.

Inside, my wife sat reading her book. She saw nothing of me. She saw nothing of the shape. A smile of contentment rested on her face as she studied the words on the pages before her. The shape probed her.

She shifted in her chair, as if suddenly uncomfortable. The probing ceased. The shape left her. In its place were three, infinitesimal spots on her right ovary. I traveled forward, into her. The spots began a slow, inexorable metastasis.

Chaos overpowers.

I left her and the room and returned to the street. Shapes swirled in and out of buildings and homes and people. I rose up, over it all, until the city sprawled beneath me like a mirage. The pores of the universe contracted and drooled and gaped as the world I knew continued around it all with contented obliviousness. 

The area near the hospital was packed with ghostly, indescribable things. I traveled toward it and watched as the shapes poured in and out, down and through, up and around. Shapes merged the free-floating bacteria with healthy workers and visitors. Bacterial bodies in human bodies. I passed through the walls and gazed upon the shapes connecting the dead and dying to the newborn and preborn. Newborn bodies of dead bodies.

Bodies in bodies.

Bodies of bodies.

I felt myself being drawn back through the walls and toward my home. I tried to move on my own, but was unable. I passed through the homes of countless people as they went about their lives, entirely oblivious to the forces around them. 

I slipped back into my skull and opened my eyes. Everything was as Id left it. The batteries of my machine no longer contained a charge. I walked downstairs and my wife greeted me with a smile of honest affection. I stared, blankly, at her abdomen, and wept.

Bodies in bodies.

I know this is going to mean almost nothing to you. There are concepts and systems mentioned in here that will be entirely alien. But theyll all be revealed soon. 

There are two kinds of [tunnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4kuldv/far_too_little_courage/?st=iy5zi13m sh=e98cf76c): high-level tunnels (HLT) and low-level tunnels (LLT). HLT are what we used to instantaneously transport physical matter from one point to another, like hemoengineered blood to [blood banks and hospitals](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4iqn1a/far_too_much_blood/?st=iy5zip4w sh=66db7853). Theyre stable and long-lived, they use less energy than one might think, and they leave no traces that anyone without our technological sophistication can detect. All one needs is to do is set location data into the systems, define which points are to be linked, and activate them.

LLT are different. They originate here, but they terminate somewhere else. Their overall properties are unknown at this point. Aida is the only one with the ability to create and use them, and she is not forthcoming with the details of their operation. She did, however, leave one open. I think she did it to tease us. And that scares me.

We couldnt leave it alone - we had to investigate. Wed never seen one before; just glimpses of the residue from ones thatd slammed shut right after theyd been detected. 

[Bill over at SIGINT](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4j7oz8/far_too_much_distortion/?st=iy5zkt30 sh=450dddeb) said to send a drone in, which seems to be his answer to everything, but I couldnt think of a compelling reason to go with anything manned. Even the [respirocyte](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4k36fu/far_too_little_air/?st=iy5zjdha sh=22842f0a) volunteers could wait until the drone did some tests.

Around noon, we sent the drone in. Right away, we got back video.

I dont know why we thought it would be space. Whenever someone mentioned the tunnels, I thought about a wormhole like in the movies with distorted space and stars and energy and all that. 

This couldnt have been more different.

The drone moved through a cavernous, fleshy tube full of reddish slime and flying, insect-like creatures that looked very much like large, [black houseflies](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4iwchu/far_too_many_flies/?st=iy5zjsto sh=9ed96010). The tube was perforated with countless holes, each hole branching off into similar tubes with the same features. It appeared to be a vast, interconnected network. 

At the end of the tube the drone occupied was an aperture. We directed it to move straight at it, and once it was touched, the aperture slid open and exposed an alien environment.

There were [mushroom](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/47k6x1/slough_part_1_of_2/?st=iy5zkdtl sh=98a45b27)-like organisms of every conceivable shape and size. And there were things moving among them. Terrible, indescribable things. The drone feed cut out.

We analyzed every frame of video for days. We attempted to query Aida for assistance, but she maintained her usual silence about anything LLT related. Shed given us enough by leaving the tunnel open. It was obvious she wanted us to see something. We just couldnt tell what it was we were seeing.

Look, Ill come right out and say it: we all knew there were aliens out there. The [Unknown 6s.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4kuldv/far_too_little_courage/?st=iy5zlht1 sh=281ad8aa) We knew that the technology we were playing with would get the attention of whoever was out there. We held seminars about potential xenobiology and contact scenarios. All that. But despite all the preparations, its obvious weve entered a situation we cant control.

For example:

An [ovoid](http://unsettlingstories.tumblr.com/post/143180231881/3d-printing) has shown up in western Pennsylvania. Its hovering over a lake in the middle of nowhere. A park ranger happened to notice it and alerted the authorities, but we were able to intervene and put the area under our command. So far, there havent been leaks. One of our cameras caught it scanning and disassembling a bear.

The food and drug division of AppDyn has inserted MR332d derivatives into many of its [nutritional supplements](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5ox8pe/runners_part_1/?st=iy5v8z0p sh=521f9140). Because supplements are unregulated in many areas, its likely the compound will ingested without raising any alarms. MR332d is the least potent of the delivery vectors, but it is likely not ready for mass dissemination. 

Stars are being occluded. We dont know how. The occlusions are fleeting. Mzuzi, who seems to be the only one Aida talks to nowadays, [went on a hike](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5oj61t/far_too_many_legs/?st=iy5zmz4m sh=74f1a591) after a conversation with her. I feel it may be related to these occlusions. When he comes back, Im anxious to learn what he found. Something tells me he is the key to learning Aidas motivations.

A small town in Syria, already besieged by their civil war, traveled. Every man, woman, child, and animal. A military craft found them spread out over a wide swath of the Pacific ocean. All physical signs pointed to flash freezing, followed by exposure to enormous pressure consistent with a depth of greater than one mile.

Finally, on a personal note, my kids getting sick. Hes getting patches of irritation all over his skin. The doctors saying its eczema, but I think MR332(x) is in the general population now. Not just isolated pockets. And if its everywhere - if Aida has failed at stopping the spread - the other contingency might need to be activated. 

Its this personal reason that compels me to reveal information about AppDyn. I firmly believe weve entered a situation beyond our control.

Maybe beyond anyones control. As I write this, Im being alerted about the presence of another LLT opening [nearby](http://unsettlingstories.com).

Its not easy to organize a marathon. You need to get permits to use the roads, you need to plot out a course, you need to find vendors and sponsors and volunteers and safety professionals and, above all, *runners.*

As shitty as it sounds, the bombing at the Boston marathon helped bring attention to road races. People want to run to show their solidarity. This is all over the Western world, mind you - not just in the US. Thats why my partner and I got the idea to put on this race in Belfast. Hes from there, I love the city, and hell, what better a location to conduct a marathon than a place with the word fast in its name? The marketing writes itself.

The Belfast city council approved the marathon pretty quickly. It didnt conflict with any other road event and Belfast was doing some citywide healthy living campaign, so another road race only helped draw attention to it. 

As online registrations for the marathon trickled in, I tackled the sponsorship duties. My partner has enough money to conduct the event on his own if he wants, but obviously its better to have sponsors. Its not only money were after, but gear, food, tents, and all that stuff. It was slow going for a while, but it started to pick up after we got Applied Dynamics on board. Companies liked the idea of having their name on the same t-shirt as AppDyn.

AppDyn didnt contribute much money - only $1000 USD. But they promised to send a few thousand of their newly-developed fruit/vegetable/nut bars they were planning to release next year. Apparently theyre great for runners.

They gave me a sample when we met - it was pretty good. I had great energy afterward. My partner ate one, too, but he had an awful [allergic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4j23w5/far_too_many_mushrooms/?st=iy4jn5mi sh=d004e26f) reaction. He blamed himself for not reading the ingredient list. It was there in plain English: peanuts. Still, he was stuck home recuperating, which meant I had to do the bulk of pre-marathon preparation. I felt bad for the guy. The reaction was way worse than ones hed had in the past. The skin blisters were just...ugh.

Two days before the race, a few friends and I decided to run the course. The official goal was to make sure everything was just how wed planned and that the course markers were set up properly, but I just really wanted to run. Id been eating the AppDyn bars for breakfast, lunch, and dinner ever since their rep gave me a case of them. I felt amazing. 

We ran the course and it seemed to be set up perfectly. About halfway through, I broke free from the group and just ran on my own. [I was alone in my thoughts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4pcmbf/never_enough_bones/?st=iy4jl5r8 sh=ea44a84a) Before I knew it, I was crossing the finish line with a personal record time.

I wanted to be elated. I wanted to brag to my partner that Id beaten his personal best, too, but it didnt seem right. Id just learned hed been hospitalized again.

The initial allergic reaction to the peanuts had passed. His doctors were confused, because none of the residual allergens should have been in his system after all that time. Still, his conditions worsened. They tested him with all the different ingredients listed on the bar. All but one - something called [MR332d](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4kuldv/far_too_little_courage/?st=iy4jkbnp sh=c5fd2a0b).

When his doctors contacted AppDyn to find out what it was, they were told it was a proprietary blend of mushroom extracts. That seemed to put the doctors on edge. AppDyn wasnt forthcoming about the types or quantities they used in the bar. Still, no one else whod consumed the bars exhibited any problems whatsoever. As the hospital fought over the phone with AppDyn to get the names of the mushrooms, my partners condition worsened.

As difficult as it was for me to see him suffering, he wanted me to keep working on the marathon. It was important to him that the race went on as planned. Wed put too much time and energy into the event to let one of us getting sick derail the whole thing.

The morning of the marathon, everything was going well. The volunteers were out on the course setting up water tables, the medical tents were erected, and the vendors were getting their products out. I got a call from my partner. He sounded better than he had in days. He said he was coming to the race.

I was shocked. The day before, when Id visited, he had looked utterly horrible. Like, deaths door horrible. I asked if he was sure, and he told me the worst was over. Hed get there just in time for the start. We hung up and I kept preparing.

The area where the runners picked up their bibs with the numbers was right next to the AppDyn tent. They were giving out the bars left and right. The runners loved them. Some even came back for more to carry with them as they ran. AppDyn obliged and gave them all they wanted.

My partner arrived about 20 minutes before the start. I almost fell over. He looked much better. I was confused, though, because hed shown up in his running gear. I asked why, assuming he couldnt possibly be planning to run after everything hed been through. I just laughed and said hed run here from the hospital and felt great. I didnt try to hide my concern and strange feeling of dread. There was nothing I could do to stop him.

Seeing my discomfort, he laughed and told me not to worry. Then he gave me a hug. His skin felt strange.

A little while later, we had the countdown. I fired the pistol when the clock hit zero and over a thousand runners took off. I went over to the control tent and monitored the radio chatter from the pace vehicles. While I listened, one of the volunteers nudged me and said, hey, I think you cut yourself and pointed to my forearm. I looked down.

I wasnt cut. Stuck to my forearm was a patch of skin that was not my own. It was bloody and ragged. I poked it. It was tacky - just like my partners had been when he hugged me. With a sickening realization, I knew it had to be his. It had just...come off. 

I excused myself and went into one of the portable toilets to clean up. I picked at the skin, and gradually, pieces came off. It was extremely [sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/47k6x1/slough_part_1_of_2/?st=iy4jmg27 sh=c0409c4c). But there was something else, too. I brought my forearm up and studied it. Attached to the underside of the tacky flesh were little nubs. They were moving. No, growing. And they looked a lot like stringy, white [mushrooms](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> [Previous.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NosleepIndex/comments/540udh/runners_usubject3642/)

I hate hiking. I hate the outdoors. I hate being sweaty, dirty, bored, and nowhere near a good WiFi signal. Yet there we were. Hiking. And I was sweaty, dirty, bored, and nowhere near a good Wifi signal. Life was unpleasant.

Dad said it would be good for us to get out of the city for a while. He didnt say why. It was obvious work was getting to him; stress always makes him want to run away from the situation until he can figure a way to manage it. I figured thats what we were doing out in the woods. Running away - one sweaty step at a time.

Every night, hed make me do my homework by the fire while he sat at his laptop with the satellite internet connection I wasnt allowed to use. I didnt really think much of it. I know he does important stuff that other people cant look at. Those arent his rules. Still, I wish I could have gotten online for a little while.

After wed been hiking for four days, Dad started to take unusual interest in the plants we were passing. Hed pull off scraps of leaves and vines and roots and put them in bags. Later, when wed set up camp in the evenings, hed pull out the little microscope hed brought and take notes on his laptop. I didnt ask questions. It was obviously work related.

On the fifth day, after Dad collected his samples and looked at them under the microscope, he seemed to get pretty excited. He didnt jump up and down or anything, but his mood went from his brooding, no-nonsense default to something kind of like a kid. It was weird. And a little annoying. I could tell he wanted to talk to me about some of the stuff he found, but had to keep his mouth shut. 

Then I got a surprise. He started talking. And not the normal Dad stuff, either. About his work. About his projects.

Id always known he was one of the top guys at a place called Applied Dynamics and that the company was huge. I never knew what he really *did*, however. If someone asked, Id just say biology stuff. Turns out I wasnt wrong.

Dad talked about samples that were turning up on the plants around us. Samples that, according to him, were getting denser and denser as we made our way through the woods. When I asked what he was talking about, he just told me to wait. He didnt say he wouldnt tell me at all, but only that I had to wait. Even though I didnt know what he was talking about, for the first time, I started to get a little excited.

On the morning of the sixth day, he told me we needed to pick up the pace. Hed been studying his laptop since before Id woken up and there seemed to be some urgency in his voice. I didnt argue. I helped him pack up the campsite and we headed off. He was moving at a good clip all day, and when I wanted to stop for lunch, he said to eat it while we walked. Even when I had to duck behind a tree for a few minutes, he just kept walking and yelled for me to catch up. I did.
When the sun began to set, we entered a clearing at the top of a hill. Dad stopped walking. He put down his backpack, pulled out the laptop, and sat in the grass. 

Are we here?, I asked.

Yeah, Dad replied. Were here.

I set up the tent while he typed and complained about how the solar charging thing for his laptop hadnt done a good job over the course of the day.

It grew darker and stars dotted the sky. Id never seen the stars so clearly. There were so many.

I heard rustling in the bushes to our left. I started but Dad put his hand on my arm and said not to worry. I stared at the bushes. A deer peeked its head out and looked around. I sighed with relief.

Why dont you look for constellations?, Dad asked.

With nothing better to do, I took his advice. I saw a few.

How much longer will--, I started to say, but was cut off.

Look up there, Dad instructed, and pointed. 

I followed his finger and saw a black dot forming over the stars. It grew larger as the seconds passed, blocking more and more of them. I couldnt tell what it was.

The bushes rustled again. I glanced over. It was the same deer. When I looked up again, I yelped. The stars were gone. No, not gone - blocked entirely. There was something hovering over the clearing. It was massive and unlike anything Id ever seen before. In the faint light coming from the crescent moon, I could see it was fleshy and pockmarked with tightly-grouped holes that made me feel intensely uncomfortable.

Dad said something that sounded like, go ahead, Aida. He pulled a flashlight out of his bag and illuminated the ground beneath the object.

The deer disappeared from the bushes and instantaneously reappeared at the center of the clearing. Three more deer joined it, along with countless squirrels, birds, woodchucks, and a bear. They didnt move. 

Dad, what--, I tried, but was cut off again.

At your own pace, Aida.

A dark, orange smoke began to pour out of the hovering object and descended on the group of animals. I instinctively drew a breath of clean air and held it. Dad shook his head.

Dont worry, youll be fine.

I exhaled and watched.

When the smoke touched the animals, their fur or feathers or skin began to move. Then split. Blood coated the grass. I felt severe revulsion but didnt turn away. From the fissures, long, stringy objects erupted. They looked like mushrooms.

Remember when I was looking in the microscope, Mo? There were spores on the plants. All the plants and animals around here have them. Its working.

I didnt know what he was talking about and I was paying him very little attention at that moment. The tips of the stringy mushrooms ballooned and dropped off, leaving baseball-sized pieces in the bloody grass. The animals continued to disintegrate as more and more of the fungus burst forth and dropped off.

I blinked and the hovering thing was gone. The animals were nothing but pulp now. A thick bouquet of mushrooms grew in their place. 

Watch, Dad whispered.

The round bits that had fallen off the mushrooms had started to wiggle. Then shudder. Tubes about as long as my fingers slid out. They slapped and writhed around in the gore, but then they went rigid. With a final wiggle, the pieces turned on top of the tubes. The tubes were legs.

The pieces skittered off in every direction with delicate streams of orange smoke leaking from holes in their bodies.

Well stay here for three more days, Dad informed me. And when we get back, everythings going to be a lot different. Youll see.

Flies buzzed over the [animal remains](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> Ive always felt anxiety and pressure in social situations. It wasnt that I disliked the people around me. Far from it. But something about the expectation to perform in a social capacity always filled me with dread.

For a while, I thought I was broken. Everyone I knew loved hanging out and being around one another. In one of my peaceful moments of alone time, I decided to do a little research to find out if something was wrong with me.

I learned about introversion. I learned about countless millions of people just like me. It became my mission to discover and understand the ins and outs of that mindset so I could better myself. I finally realized I didnt have to change who I was. I could embrace it.

Over the years, Ive cultivated knowledge I feel may be helpful to other introverts who dont know there are people like them. I want to share with you some examples of situations where I felt uncomfortable and how I handled them. I dont expect everyone to encounter the exact same situations or react the same way, but I think this will be a good template for other introverts to use.

**1. Do you feel enormous anxiety about having to go to parties? You may be an introvert!**

There was a party at my college. My boyfriend at the time, Jay, really wanted me to attend. This was at a really bad time in my life and the last thing I wanted to do was plaster a smile on my face and interact with drunken strangers. I tried and tried to convince Jay that I didnt feel well and that the party wouldnt be a good idea, but he kept trying to guilt trip me into going.

After a while, I told him Id go. The party was a couple days away.

I was really upset with both Jay and myself. I was mad at him for not respecting my claim that I was sick, but I also hated myself for being so messed up that I was forcing him to have to make me to go to a silly party. I didnt sleep for two nights because I was so nervous.

On the day of the party, while Jay was still sleeping, I secretly took a dose of syrup of ipecac. When Jay awoke, I was in the bathroom puking my guts up. Id never felt so sick in my life, but he finally believed me. Hours later, after hed made sure I was going to be okay, he went to the party by himself. Id won. My stomach still hurt, but the night alone was wonderful.

**2.  Have you ever been at work and been told you need to do something that fills you with dread because youll have to interact with other people? You may be an introvert!**

Years later, there was a mandatory retreat at my job. All employees had to go for team building or something similarly awful. Id just started feeling comfortable at work, too; Im a designer so I get to spend almost all day alone, drawing logos or characters or whatever for clients. Hearing I had to go on this retreat brought terrible, breathless anxiety. I didnt know what to do.

On my drive to the convention center, I saw a homeless man sitting near a payphone. I had an idea. We spoke for a few seconds, I handed him a quarter and a $20 bill, then I got back in my car. I drove up the street, parked, and watched the man in my mirror.

He picked up the phone and dialed. A minute or two later, he hung up and ran away. I pulled the car back into traffic and kept going toward the retreat. Ten minutes later, I got a phone call from my supervisor saying someone had called in a bomb threat at the convention center. We were to come to the office and treat it as a normal workday.

**3.  Does the thought of seeing people from your past make you feel awful because youll be in a situation where you need to talk about your life? You may be an introvert!**

My sister, Melinda, was having her baby shower. Shes only a couple years older than me, so we knew many of the same people in high school. Shes still friends with most of them. Im not. Most of them used to make fun of me while others only talked to me because I was Melindas sister. I didnt want to go. At all.

My car was in the shop, so Melinda offered to pick me up. There was no use trying to fake being sick. Mel knows Im an introvert and get anxious in social situations. But this was important to her. She wouldnt take no for an answer.

She picked me up a few hours before the party so we could go to our parents house where the event was being hosted. The plan was to help Mom set things up so she didnt have to do it all. I wanted to do the setting up and leave, but that was out of the question.

Mels phone rang while we were on our way. It was her friend, Denise. Apparently Denise and eight other guests had arrived early to help Mom with the decorating so Mel wouldnt have to. While Mel was elated, I was distraught. Id built in a mental countdown that gave me three hours before Id have to be around those people. I was planning on using those hours to try to get myself in a state of mind where I could accept being with them. But now it was gone. I had no time to prepare.

I started to silently panic as we hurtled down the highway toward my impending social cataclysm. I was sweating. Everything blurred. My heartbeat was like a series of constant detonations behind my ribcage. Ahead of us, on the side of the highway, I saw a family of deer. One of the fawns placed a foot on the pavement. I saw an opportunity.

I screamed, look out! and grabbed the steering wheel, turning it in the opposite direction. Our car struck the median, flipped over it, and sent us into oncoming traffic. Another car hit us at 75 miles per hour.

Somehow, when the whirlwind of chaos had ended and the car was no longer moving, I was relatively unhurt. My arm and leg were broken, that I could tell immediately, but everything else seemed okay. Mels side had taken the brunt of it.

Mel was pinned by her legs by the steering column. She was bleeding badly from her head, but she was breathing. Her hands were flailing at her belly. I looked down. A piece of metal from God-knows-where had carved a deep gash through her lower abdomen. I could see the a wet loop of intestine sticking out. And something else. A tiny, twitching foot.

The baby shower was cancelled.

So if any of these scenarios of socialization and togetherness make you feel anxious or lightheaded, you may be an introvert! I hope this helps, because nothing is worse than feeling like you have no control over your life. Sometimes its just good to be alone. And you know what? Theres nothing wrong with it. Theres no shame in [being different.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> Yeah so for those who dont know me Im Madison. I told a [story about my stupid sister](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4ho869/um_can_any_of_you_guys_tell_me_whats_wrong_with/?st=ivbamqdh sh=d65e3411), then [my gross brother](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5c2xzz/ok_now_my_brother_is_all_messed_up_and_gross_lol/?st=ixqaar4v sh=33e9ea48), then my [poor hot gay friend Kevin](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5i4e1h/omg_guys_why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_a_boyfriend/?st=ixqab4ot sh=30c286c6). If you dont know those stories, I kinda hate you because theyre really important and like who the h*ck do you think you are coming in here and acting like youre going to read about my first time and not care about the other things that are happening in my life? You should go, like, assistant manage a small diner or something just as sad lol.

Omg anyway guess what? IM GONNA TELL YOU A STORY!! :D

This is gonna sound soooooo creepy and weird but youll read it anyway because Im awesome and its fun to read stuff about people who are better than you lol. Omg btw I love Katniss Evergreen. Random. But yeah dont worry its not like it was my uncle or anything gross like a dog or hippo or something. 

Ok so maybe like 18 months ago this really cute guy snuck into my room. You know how vampires have to get invited into your room before they can come in your room and visit you in your room? Yeah this wasnt like that because he wasnt a vampire. This guy just kinda came in through the window and sat on the side of my bed.

I was like what are you doing here and got all mad because I didnt have my hair right and I was wearing my ugly fleecy pants instead of my hot fleecy pants and he was okay looking but not like stupid Kevins hot dumb brainless head but I didnt know Kevin back then so he was better than okay I guess. 

I wanted to call Dad to come beat the guy up but there was something about him that was kinda cool. He was like gray like a rock or a cloud or gay poetry stuff and had cool red eyes and a really big mouth. He started rubbing my hair which was annoying but I couldnt move for some reason then he whispered in my ear:

Madison youre going to be a mom someday. Then his fingers got really long and skinny and he put them behind my eyes.

I was like um gross and no thank you but I didnt say it because I still couldnt move and then everything got all dark and I woke up kinda sore and stuff. And ew not there.

And thats the story! You guys are lucky Im good at setting a mood otherwise that wouldve seemed even weirder and creepier than it was.

But yeah, that was my first time with the gray man.

Wanna know why Im telling you all this? Obv you do lol.

Welllllllllllllllllll GUYS IM GONNA BE A MOM!!!

Ok ok ok you cant tell my parents but its not like they can see the little baby yet anyway because its growing behind my eyes but I can already feel its tiny little hands pushing on the eye cords or whatever theyre called. Good thing Im not ticklish lol.

Theres only one person I told and thats poor gay Kevin so I could make him feel jealous but he just kinda drooled and said uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh because hes annoying but so hot but I know he wished he was the one who put it in me and not the gray man. Its funny because Id forgotten all about the gray man until the little baby started growing over the weekend! Itd been years and I thought babies were made in nine months and in a uterus but mine is gonna be cool so thats why its different.

Another weird thing - Ive always always always hated babies! I was so happy when my little brother died and until he came back I had to hear him crying and stuff every time I bent his knee back when Mom or Dad wasnt looking. But now, Im so excited to be a mom. What could be better than another little Madison running around? Literally nothing, thats what.

Im going to be the coolest mom. Ill let my baby have parties and vape and talk to Black God and wear whatever she wants and never have to learn Spanish if she doesnt want.

Check this out - when Gina died it was exactly one year after the gray man came to visit. I never even connected that! I was so excited to have my bedroom all to myself I didnt even think of the dates being the same! Btw guys it is SO COOL to still have a room to myself and I wont even mind sharing with the baby.

But yeah at school I didnt want to tell people about the baby except Kevin but get this! Karen said something bad about my hair and said it wasnt really blonde but brown like Im an Italian or something and I got real mad and all of the sudden a little baby hand came out of my eye and cut Karens throat open lol. NOBODY saw it happen, either! Karen was laughing at me and then her neck was all shooting blood and stuff and she died and everyone was sad and I pretended to be sad but I wasnt sad even though I have to go to a little vigil and say Im sad.

Im so not sad. My baby is awesome and Im so glad the gray man put it in me. I just dont know when Im going to tell my parents. It seems like theyre [never home anymore](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> Im a geologist working at Death Valley National Park in Nevada. Over the last few months, weve been studying the geological formation dubbed Devils Hole. [Heres what it looks like](https://youtu.be/a6h82PIi_-0), for those interested.

Anyway, Ive always found this place somewhat disconcerting. We have a vague idea of how it came to be and what makes it do what it does, but theres something else. Something...off.

The other day, we sent a little submarine drone into the water to see if it could map out the labyrinthine cave system we know is there, but has been completely inaccessible for decades. Also, we wanted to find out how deep it goes. The fact an earthquake in China could cause the water to rise so substantially at this spot in Nevada makes us think it goes way deeper than preliminary estimates.

The sub started to map the first 50 feet. It was tough to get a great signal; the mineral content of the water was really inhospitable to the systems we use and how they communicate with one another - not to mention the superheated water near the geothermal vents once you get down there could be enough to disable the drone entirely.

At around 75 feet, the signal got really touchy. Wed have a few minutes of decent communication, but then it would cut out completely and leave us wondering if the sub had crashed or had been damaged beyond recovery. 

During the windows when we could move the drone, we explored from cave to cave and went deeper and deeper. The water was well above boiling; as the pressure increased, so did the temperature. The sub was rated for up to 400 degrees for a short period of time, and pockets of water were getting close to that maximum.

We got to a relatively cool spot (around 225 Fahrenheit) and were told to standby. Greg, the guy who was operating the optical equipment on the drone, kept insisting that he was seeing flashes of light way below our position. I kept insisting that the equipment was malfunctioning and causing the flashes, but Greg wouldnt shut up about another sensor registering bursts of heat at the same time the flashes showed up.

We argued for a little while and the drone stayed in place. The water level in the hole started to rise. This wasnt unexpected; a surprisingly little amount of seismic activity anywhere in the world was enough to move the water over here. We kept bickering and didnt notice more flashes on the screen until much later, when we analyzed the video. 

What finally knocked us out of our respective tantrums, though, was the way the water started to change color. It went from its normal shade to a dull red. Greg glanced at the screen and noticed the depth of the water in the cave chamber, originally at 36 feet, had changed to 353,000 feet. We knew had to be an error.

More flashes showed up on the screen as the water frothed and burbled on the surface, then the feed went dead. And stayed dead. 

Greg and I analyzed the video overnight. Everything wed seen was there and just as confusing - but then Greg saw a tiny spike in the audio track right when the depth of the cave appeared to drop straight down.

He ran it through a few filters to amplify the signal and clean it up, then he played it back. We listened to it about 20 times in a row, despite hearing it perfectly the first time.

Let me sleep. Let me dream. Soon I will rise.

Corresponding with the massive increase in depth and the last word of the message, there was one more flash in the final video frame before the drone was lost. After Greg cleaned it up, we saw what it was. A single, glowing, red eye that looked like the size of a house.

<TEXT> Their pale faces were tilted skyward. Each pair of eyes brimmed with hope. In the moonlight, their skin seemed luminous; a battle of bright flesh against the surrounding darkness. Their mouths were slightly open, as if expecting to receive holy communion. They stood in a circle on the mossy ground, hand in hand. Their open throats drooled blood down their young chests.

Under my bare feet, the moss felt so comforting. So inviting. With the children standing guard, I would curl up on the ground and fall asleep.

That was 25 years ago. It was my nightly ritual. Id sleepwalk to the clearing in the woods outside our home and sleep next to the five children. No one noticed I came home at dawn. No one would have cared anyway.

After I turned 14, it all stopped. I assumed it had to have been a recurring dream. Yes, I sleepwalked nearly every night. Yes, I spent those nights in the woods. But no children were ever reported missing. There were no slit throats. Just trees and moss. Lots and lots of moss.

I moved away when I turned 19. As the years went by, the memories grew hazy, as theyre wont to do. Certain things trigger them, though. Some more strongly than others. Lately, its been open mouths.

The open mouths of the children were always a source of fascination for me. I wasnt put off by their slit throats. I wasnt disturbed by their warm, skyward stare. No, their mouths were the source of my inquisitiveness. I would walk around their circle, moss brushing between my toes, and look inside their mouths. They looked warm and soft; pink tongues and small teeth and narrow throats. 

When I was eight, I kissed one of the two girls. The redhead. Her lips were full and tasted like pine. I felt my breath collect in her mouth and spill back into mine. She didnt move. My body sang.

I tasted pine for years afterward. No kiss since has ever been so enthralling. The decades passed with a growing sense unfulfillment.

When my parents died last year, I moved back into their home. It was very much the same. Now I go about my day-to-day business, but the children are still very much in my mind. The softness of the moss against my skin and the sense of protection I had as I slept near them has been impossible to shake. My nostalgia has only grown since returning to the home near where it had all happened.

Some nights, I walk to the mossy clearing. Its as beautiful as it always had been, especially when the moon is full and I recall it shining against porcelain skin and bright eyes and wet mouths. Ill curl up on the moss and sob myself to sleep. Alone.

Ive found some solace in cultivating that same moss. Its the only tangible remnant of that comforting time in my life. Ive been able to coax patches of it to grow in my dirt-floor basement, and thats where I sleep now. There, in the moss, in the comfort of my home, I can dream again. The dreams are a temporary fix, but better than nothing. Theyll be enough until it can happen again. I know it will.

The first child I claimed is a girl with red hair. The bulb in the basement doesnt look like moonlight. Its yellow hue causes her skin to look sallow and sickly. Her eyes are clouded and difficult to keep open. The gaping throat is the same, though. The throat keeps the memory real. And before I curl up next to her pinned feet and sleep, I make sure to kiss her open mouth. I fantasize about pine as the taste of metal [coats my tongue](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TITLE> Caviar </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ive gone all over the world to find the best food. Six continents, thousands of regions, countless dishes; all in search of the perfect meal. For a while, I thought it may never happen. There was always something a little off; salt, freshness, temperature - tiny, niggling complaints that, to anyone else, would be meaningless. To me, though, they were the difference between perfection and mundanity. My quest went on.

During my travels, Id learned about an underground supper club in Moscow which met once a year. While underground supper club sounds mysterious and illicit, its just a place that operates casually, aka: without a food license. Chefs all over do it all the time for their friends. Ive been to many.

This one was supposed to be different. They had the best caviar.

Caviar is a luxury item, but even in luxury-obsessed Russia, its started to fall out of favor because of sustainability issues. Its still widely available, but the good stuff is getting harder and harder to find. The best stuff is nearly impossible to get a hold of. Its locked down by the oligarchs and heads of state; if youre not one of them or in close company, youre out of luck. So when I heard that supper club would be serving the best of the best, I knew I had to get in there.

It wasnt easy.

It took four years to ingratiate myself with influential Moscow foodies. I spent thousands upon thousands of dollars at their restaurants, building a reputation, blogging about their food, and cultivating relationships. Vasily Protchenko, a restaurateur and minor celebrity in Moscow, noticed me. Over time, we became friends. I didnt know if he was privy to the supper club, but if anyone was, he had to be one of them. I didnt say anything, though. I waited. 

One afternoon, Vasily and I were talking about caviar, specifically the best sources. He mentioned the waters off Japan, which I found strange, since the Fukushima disaster had scared people away from certain types of fish in that area. He agreed that it was moderately disconcerting, but insisted the caviar from the fish in those waters was sublime. Then it happened.

You know, he told me, theres something even better. Something practically nobody knows about. Can you keep a secret?

I did my best to contain my excitement. This had to be what Id been waiting for.

Of course, I told him, and leaned in to listen.

Vasily told me about the supper club. There were 20 chefs and a few of their close friends from all around the world. They met in a restaurant right down the street from Vasilys, and if I was willing to pitch in the $5,000 and keep my mouth shut, Id be allowed to attend. One hour and a trip to the bank later, I had the $5,000. All I had to do was wait.

On the evening of the supper, I met with Vasily at his restaurant and had a drink. Then we walked down to the meeting place, which had a sign in front saying it was closed for the weekend. We walked around back to the kitchen and opened the door. The kitchen was full of chefs. Some of the chefs I recognized from my travels, some were strangers. All were busy preparing dishes for the evening.

We sat in the main dining room and I admired the decor. The room was softly candlelit and the windows had been covered in black paper. It was obvious this was a private event and no prying eyes were allowed.

How does this work?, I asked Vasily.

They just start bringing out courses. Theyre small, obviously, so you can sample all of them. The caviar will be at the end, I think. Its the rarest and most special of all the dishes.

True to his word, the food began to arrive. We were treated to sumptuous courses prepared by the meticulous and downright-genius minds of the master chefs. I ate and drank until my head spun.

Vasily excused himself and went to the kitchen. I chatted with some of the other diners and learned many were like me - rich foodies looking to experience the best of the best. 

After a little while and a few more courses, someone near the kitchen clapped their hands to get everyones attention. To my surprise, it was Vasily.

I want to thank everyone for coming tonight, he announced. The evening, as always, has been an incredible success. Weve sampled food from the greatest chefs around the world, and as is customary, we like to end the night with something very special. You all know Im passionate about my caviar. Youve had the best from all over; Russia, Japan, Canada, etc etc. Tonight, I have another treat. Its something extremely rare and takes a very long time to produce in quantities fit for consumption.

A parade of servers carrying silver trays emerged from the kitchen. They swarmed around the room, placing plates of food in front of each diner. Vasily continued.

This is the culmination of a years work. I had to pull a lot of strings and grease a lot of palms to bring this to you tonight, but for the first time, Id like to share with you this caviar. It is without a doubt the rarest caviar on the planet, and I believe it is the most exquisite. Please, enjoy.

Everyone applauded and Vasily bowed and came back to me.

I had no idea you were the one behind the caviar!, I exclaimed.

Vasily grinned. I wanted you to be surprised, he admitted. Now please, eat. Let me know what you think.

I looked down at my plate. There was a toast point, perfectly browned, covered with a reddish-brown paste. Atop the paste was a dollop of crme frache flecked with green pieces of dill. My mouth watered.

I brought it to my mouth and bit. My eyelids closed and I chewed, savoring the taste. It was thick and briny with distinct, livery notes. It was unlike any caviar Id had in the past, but it was undoubtedly spectacular. I took another bite. The complexity of the flavor profile was mind boggling. Without realizing it, Id been grinning like an idiot the whole time.

Vasily asked, so what do you think?

I swallowed and said, its the most incredible thing Ive ever tasted. Its so smooth and buttery; theres none of the intense saltiness or pop of normal caviar and I initially missed it, but then the notes of liver came through and coated my tongue. Where is it from?

North Korea, Vasily said.

My God, I replied, how did you get access to those waters without being shot?

Well heres the thing, Vasily told me, I know a guy. Hes a doctor over there.

I picked up my last piece and ate it while Vasily talked.

I knew Id never be able to fish in NK waters. But the first time the doctor and I talked, I realized he had access to this caviar without even knowing it. Over the years, I paid him a lot of money to collect it for me.

I was puzzled.

So the doctor brought you the fish?, I asked.

Vasily laughed. No no no, the doctor isnt a fisherman! Hes a specialist - he has no time for fish.

A specialist in what?, I inquired, profoundly confused.

Gynecology, Vasily told me. Theyre really into forced sterilizations over there. Its bad for them but great for us. Without it, we wouldnt have any of this caviar!

The room seemed to darken and I felt my mouth getting very wet and very dry at the same time. I formed the words, Vasily, what kind of caviar is this?

The chef grinned. [Lady caviar!](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> **September 9th, 2016**

This city is on no ones map. If it had ever been, those people have long since died. As have their children. And grandchildren. And great grandchildren. And great-great grandchildren. And so on.

Nonetheless, here the city stands. My source was right. My money was well spent. These ancient structures are black tombs. Weve set up our camp on the outskirts. The city is far too cold.

**September 10th, 2016**

Charles kept watch while I slept. He claimed to see no signs of life, but sounds kept him constantly alert. Soft sounds. Soft, wet, and unimposing. Sounds which drifted in and out at the limits of audibility, as if they were whispers, but windblown and damp - redolent of dying breaths and last words. 

I heard nothing. My sleep was as black as the structures ahead of us. No sounds penetrated the dreamless morass. For a brief moment upon waking, I believed to have been dead. 

Today, we tour the city.

**September 11th, 2016**

Before the chill had sapped our energy, we had explored the first couple hundred feet of the city. We stuck to the outsides, cataloging the sheer stone facades of the structures. Despite their immense age, the buildings stood unharmed. We found no indication of what had made the sounds Charles had heard.

Overnight, as Charles slept, I heard it myself. They were as hed described. However, I recognized structure in the sporadic haze of noise. If it wasnt a language, it was a natural phenomenon unlike any ever discovered. My mind wandered while I watched Charles chest rise and fall. 

The whispers suffused my auditory cortex and a synesthetic wave of hallucinatory strangeness swept through me. The sounds shimmered in my vision and danced on my tongue. They tasted like metal. Like blood. Rather than feeling disgusted, I felt a perverse sense of joy.

**September 12th, 2016**

I blinked and Charles was gone. How I could have fallen asleep is a mystery, as I was standing. But when my eyelids lifted, it was day. And my partner had disappeared. In his place were footsteps leading to the city.

The sounds are loud now. Im miles within the bowels of the cold, black city. Structures tower over me and block the sun; my breath freezes in front of my face on this late-summer day. The temperature only contributes to the feeling of wrongness.

When the wind blows, I think I hear Charles calling my name. Over and over and over and over, swept by gales of air and changing pressures and permeating the wet sounds which echo off every hut and dwelling, he calls. I will not sleep tonight.

**September 13th, 2016**

The first sign of life presented itself to me early this morning. It was a fleck of skin or gristle glinting in the sunlight. It was attached to the side of a small structure. When I went in close to investigate, I discovered it was growing from deep within a crack in the stone. I pressed my knife into it and it bled and retracted into the rock. If it werent for the gales of wind and what I now know to be Charles moans, I could have sworn I heard it make a noise. A tiny, wet noise.

**September 14th, 2016**

It is difficult to keep the fires from blowing out overnight. The expanse of this city is unlike what either of us had expected. I am beyond lost now; I am impelled ahead with the futile desire to help Charles and get us home.

The deeper I get, the worse shape the structures seem to be in. All the cracks and missing pieces are filled with the same, living tissue. Its density only increases as I follow the sounds. Always following the sounds. I know I should be running in the opposite direction. The flesh within the buildings ripples in directional peristalsis. I am following it. I have yet to see any entrance to any structure. 

**September 15th, 2016**

The city is more meat than stone now. The wet whispers assault my ears and work to infiltrate all my senses. I feel them coursing through my body. Onward, still, I trudge. The temperature is warmer. I can think of nothing other than forward movement.

**September 16th, 2016**

The cold has been replaced by heat and humidity. The stone has been subsumed by flesh; titanic structures of muscle and veins reach toward the gray sky. All is wet. All is moving.

**September 17th, 2016**

This morning, I discovered Charles. A Charles. Whether it was my partner or not is something I dont know. He was trapped within the meat of a structure. It appeared his body had been incorporated into the surrounding flesh; thick veins fed his legs and neck.

A few feet away, other Charleses were growing from different structures. All were in different forms of development. All twitched and moved with the all-encompassing fleshscape.

Theyve since noticed me. They began with simple staring, but now they are reaching. The hands of my partner - the man Ive loved - are extending toward my hands; hands which theyve held countless times in what feels like a distant past.

The wet whispers are seductive and intoxicating. I look back toward the sea of flesh and stone Ive crossed to reach this point. The thought of the cold on the outskirts of the city is hideous. To leave this warm womb where I am wanted and accepted seems abhorrent. And now, as veins extend from the hands of the Charleses, patiently waiting for my acceptance, I have a choice. Do I leave, cold and alone? Or do I enter this union of flesh?

Ive been cold and alone for so long. I need to believe Im ready for something new. Something warm. Something we can experience together. Pray for me. [Pray for us.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> I get between 250-400k per month. I'm a writer of short horror stories. The majority of my traffic comes from Tumblr but I also get some from Reddit. I've only monetized with Adsense but I'm still learning a lot. It's been a little over a year since I started.  

As far as three things, I don't really know. I think the most important thing was what I just did, which was move to a self hosted Wordpress site. Way more freedom. 

I have no idea what I'm doing.

<TEXT> Recalling the sensation of my eyes bursting before they turned to ash is the only feeling of comfort I can extract from that moment last year.

I was walking my dog on the beach near my home. The beach had been closed for the season because of a toxic algae bloom. The woods in my backyard let out to the beach, though, and I knew enough to stay away from the water.

Parker and I were finishing up when I heard splashing near the shore. I glanced over and saw what appeared to be a school of fish trapped under the thick, algal sludge. I was surprised; the water was supposedly hypoxic from the algae. I assumed the fish would stay away.

The splashing persisted as we walked by. Parker growled. I was concerned, since he never showed any aggression of any sort since wed gotten him neutered. But as the splashing grew louder and the water grew increasingly turbid, Parkers growls became ferocious and he started to bark and pull at his leash.

I stopped and held the leash with both hands. The last thing I wanted was for him to jump in and get that algae all over him. I watched the water with Parker for a minute, then tugged the leash to get us back on track. The splashing stopped. Parker calmed down. We turned and began to move back toward the woods.

Right when we were about to step through the treeline, Parker pulled at my leash again. I tugged right back and moved on. Janice was making dinner and Id be damned if wed be late. Parker pulled again. Hard. At the same time, he whimpered. I glanced down while pulling back. My breath caught in my throat.

Something was grabbing Parkers hind leg. Something thick and tubular, almost like a heavily-veined tentacle. As the steady tug persisted and Parkers whimpering grew shrill and pained, I whirled around and saw the thick rope of veiny muscle stretching from the algae to my dog.

Without thinking, I stomped on the tentacle, feeling its boneless gristle deform under the heel of my boot. With a pull so powerful it tore the leash from my hand and caused a sickening, cracking sound to come from the area of Parkers leg and hip, the dog was launched through the air and splashed into the water. He struggled to stay afloat.

I ran across the beach and was about to jump in when a writhing mass of tentacles of all sizes began to emerge from the water. They were everywhere and stretched as far as I could see. Way in the distance, something else was starting to come to the surface. 

I was rooted to the ground with sheer, uncomprehending terror. I gazed at the shape as it rose from the surf. Parker had disappeared under the water. The tentacles slapped and writhed and twisted against one another as if they were dancing. My eyes remained riveted to the form emerging about 1000 feet offshore. I felt a hideous pressure forming in the back of my eyes accompanied by a blinding headache.

Seagulls swooped from the air to bite the fleshy masses, only to be pulled under by smaller, lightning-quick tendrils erupting from the larger tentacles. As more of the mass in the distance emerged, the blurrier it got. But as the pressure grew unbearable and my vision diminished, I still made out features: a hideous, gaping mouth. Clusters of holes with stalks emerging from them. Eyes attached to each stalk. And something else - something I can only describe as orbs of meat slowly orbiting its main bulk. I wept. 

It made one sound. Only one.

With a wet pop, my eyes burst. I felt the lachrymal fluid boiling as it ran down my cheeks. There was intense heat in my eye sockets and I was dimly aware of my hair beginning to burn. Before I lost consciousness, I was overwhelmed by a sensation of relief that I no longer had eyes to stare at the abomination in the water. I was ready to die.

Three months later, I woke up in my own bed. Id been in the hospital for 10 weeks. My wife had cared for me the entire time. No one knew what had happened to me. If it hadnt been for another passerby, I would have died on that beach.

In the days that followed, I did my best to relay to my wife what had happened. She just stroked the remains of my face and tried to console me. I could tell she believed none of it.

In my eyeless nightmare, I try to move on with my life. Its slow going. After what Id seen, I can think of almost nothing else. There are times when I think I can get by. Times, late at night, while Janice sleeps, and I lay on my back gathering the emotional strength Ill need to carry on.

But then, far off in the distance, I hear Parker barking. And theyre barks made by something other than him working his mouth and throat and lungs. 

Ill turn over in bed and imagine tears leaking out of my old eyes, knowing things will never be [good again](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> **November 19th, 2016**

The lights in the sky were a diversion. We should have looked down.

**November 20th, 2016**

In a matter of days, the following terms will have meaning to everyone in the world:

That which grows through our heels.

That which tastes our skin.

That which fills our pores.

That which empties.

**November 21st, 2016**

Laura is dead. Gus is dead. Mohammad is dead. Nes is dead.

**November 22nd, 2016**

Where can one go when everywhere is a trap waiting to be sprung? I feel as if Im navigating an endless minefield, with every step having the potential to be my last. Everyone is staring at the sky with hope in their eyes. Everyone is going to die.

**November 23rd, 2016**

We shouldn't have gone looking for them.

**November 24th, 2016**

Roger is dead. He is standing right in front of me.

**November 25th, 2016**

That which grows through Rogers heels has reached his calves and thighs. His neck is still craned skyward and his beatific smile has yet to slip. His death mask is one of hope and astonishment. His body is being digested as he stands.

**November 26th, 2016**

The last of our group received a message from the other side of the base. Everyone is still to remain silent. I refuse. Even if Im dead by the time this is released, people can still say they had some warning. 

It may be too late.

**November 27th, 2016**

Dr. Franklin is dead. He was taken while in the shower. I was called to officially verify the cause of death, as if it were possible to have been anything other than what was already obvious. He was rooted to the ground and they continued to grow through the tile floor. As I watched, his achilles tendons snapped and rolled up into his calves. He did not fall. The growths seem to be moving faster now. Their tiny tongues flick over his skin.

**November 28th, 2016**

Laura, Gus, Mohammad, and Nes have started to undergo phase two. Their pores are stretching. The stalks are starting to push out. We can see the entities moving throughout their bodies. How such enormous pressure can be contained by skin is a mystery I hope to die before uncovering.

Mohammad has connected to Gus. Laura and Nes are growing away from the cluster. Seabirds are dying.

**November 29th, 2016**

Roger has connected to Dr. Franklin across a space of 250 yards. There appears to be no material strong enough to block the connections once theyve started. 

Both Roger and the doctor have gone into phase two faster than any of the others.

**November 30th, 2016**

The eruptions from the ground are reaching into the sky to capture birds. It began with a few in the vicinity of the Laura/Gus/Mohammad/Nes cluster, but it has spread island-wide. The highest burst point appears to be 1200 feet.

**December 1st, 2016**

One of our watercraft discovered a blue whale five feet below the surface. The animal had been rooted. Further investigation showed a 200 swath below the whale had also been rooted. Some of the affected had reached phase three.

**December 2nd, 2016**

All the dead on the island have entered phase three. The entities are emptying out of the pores and transforming the ground below. The birds which had been rooted mid flight are raining the substance onto the ground and water. The new biology is beginning to take hold. Its becoming harder to breathe.

**December 3rd, 2016**

The first report of rooting on the mainland came through overnight. There is nothing left to do but wait. If the lights give you any pleasure, just keep watching them. Just enjoy the moment for as long as you can. [Im sorry.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> Especially if the furs white. Sure, you might get the bulk of it off the individual fibers, but a stain will still be there. Its not easy to find someone who wants to blow a six-foot tall ferret with a blood stain on the business end.


Hi, Im Shane. Im 42 and Im a furry. And no, Im not one of those adorable ones who goes to conventions and acts like my favorite cartoon character and makes cute noises and then goes home. Im a degenerate. I like to be around other degenerates. Especially ones in fur suits. Take a moment to psychoanalyze me from your armchair. Ill wait.


Ready?


Ok.


My ilk dont have conventions. We get together, dont get me wrong, but conventions arent really our thing. Id say the closest thing we have is a gaping, semen-encrusted orgy of bodies sweating and panting inside hot suits trying to bring one another to orgasm. If that last sentence didnt give you an erection, then you probably wouldnt be interested. (If you are, send me a private message.)


Theres the background, now lets get to the root of the problem: the pizza-sized blood stain all over the cock slot of my suit.


Last Halloween, I got a text from my buddy about a meetup at the apartment of one of our regulars. I was excited - this guy was a freak. He was independently wealthy, always had the best drugs and booze, and since he owned the whole apartment building, we could be as loud and disgusting as we wanted. I am very loud. I am profoundly disgusting.


Anyway, I went and had an absolute blast. Nine guys and two women. Not that the sexes of the participants mattered, of course. Were all just furry plugs and outlets, my friends. Furry plugs and outlets.


After the initial debauchery, one of the guys didnt get up off the tarp. He was facedown with the rear flap of his fur suit open. That wasnt the odd part, since the flaps of all our suits were open, but unlike us, this guy wasnt moving. 


The owner of the apartment was extremely pissed off. The exposed skin peeking out from behind his Mike from Monsters Inc. costume was beet red. One of the main rules of his house was NO ONE was allowed to overdose. Aside from the complications of dealing with the police and ambulance, it made the whole party look bad. And he NOT want to look like a bad host.


We took turns trying to get the guy to his feet. He was breathing, which was a good sign, but he just wouldnt respond. Now, Ive been around ODs before. Shit happens. But something about this guy wasnt right. Id never seen him before. Turned out none of us had.


Id say the majority of us had a go at him at one point or another during the festivities, and Im fairly certain I remember his furry, green belly pushing against my forehead pretty early in the night. But now he was still facedown on the tarp preventing our collective liquids from soaking into the carpet. It was a really nice carpet.


As the host was looking for his phone to call an ambulance, the prostrate man started to get up. He looked around at us, blinked a few times, then smiled. We all breathed a sigh of relief, then asked the guy what had happened. He just apologized and told us he has narcoleptic episodes after intense physical exertion, and its nothing to worry about. Then he made us all laugh when he asked who was ready for another round of action.


All of us were, so we started up again. Then the power went out.


I was balls deep in our narcoleptic Oscar the Grouch when the room went dark. I didnt mind. Oscar certainly didnt, either. No one did. I heard the host yell, must be the ghost!, and we all laughed amidst moans and around mouthfuls of unimaginable depravity. Supposedly the hosts apartment was haunted by the original owner. But on we plowed, so to speak, making our way from partner to partner in the dark. 


A little while later, the room started to smell. Let me be more specific: the room started to smell worse. The regular background scent of 11 people fucking in rarely-washed suits and working up and good, frothy sweat in the process can be a bit off putting to those unaccustomed to our type of fun. But this smell was different. And it was powerful.


Being the troopers we were, we managed to go for another few minutes before one of us threw up. And that was the end of the orgy. People started to complain about the smell and the host went into the kitchen to grab a flashlight and a few candles while we mulled around and wiped off our various wipeables. 


A light flicked on and a candle was lit. We surveyed the area and a couple people left. Oscar the Grouch was on the tarp again, ass in the air. Something about the color of his skin, even in the dimness of the flashlight and candles, didnt look right.


Hey, Oscar, I called, and nudged him. He flopped over onto his side. I sighed as one of the women started to take off the head portion of his suit so he could get some air.


The portion came off and the most hideous smell Id ever encountered filled the air. The lights blinked back on and everyone shouted in despair and horror. We were all coated in blood and other incomprehensibly horrific fluids.


Fast forward a few hours.


We were all at the police station. Oscar was dead. Very, very dead. According to someone at the station, he looked like hed been dead for a long, long time. They were still trying to ID the body.


Fast forward to a week later.


All of us were charged with desecrating a corpse. In our state of collective disgust and confusion, none of us protested it. It looked like wed be facing some pretty serious fines and community service, but no jail. Thank God. 


They still hadnt IDd Oscar.


Yesterday, I was at home when my phone rang. It was my buddy whod invited me to the Halloween party. His friend, the wealthy party host, had been doing renovations on the apartment. Apparently the smell just wouldnt get out of the room wed occupied, so he was tearing down the whole thing. In the process, he came across a note, neatly carved into the wood on the underside of the floorboards.


If you ever find this, Im sorry for the trouble I may have caused. Ive been watching all the fun youve had over the years and wanted to try it for myself. I figured it wouldnt hurt to give corporeality one more shot. It was very, very worth it. Thanks!


I didnt really know how to respond to that. It didnt make much sense, but neither did the narcoleptic furry-turned-cadaver who showed up at the orgy. I asked my friend what we should do, and he replied pretty quickly, informing me wed be having another get-together to honor the dead mans memory this coming weekend. 


I cant fucking wait. Apparently therell be 25 people there.


But I just cannot get this damn stain out of my fur suit. I dont think it will make a good first-impression with the [new folks.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> When you work in an Alzheimers ward, its difficult to determine whether or not a patient is telling the truth. Obviously theres no malice intended if theyre lying; its likely they believe what theyre saying to be true. Its the unfortunate nature of the disease. 


A few nights ago, Madge Daniels started to complain about abdominal discomfort. We believed her. Thered been a nasty stomach virus going around for the last couple weeks. Madges overall lucidity was pretty good, too, so we did our best to make her comfortable and ensure she was getting a lot of fluids and adequate rest.


The next morning, Lou Franks, Ray Davis, Melinda Renz, and Veronica Auster-Coates were complaining about their own stomach pain. We gave them a once-over. They seemed fine. We figured theyd heard about Madges problem and believed they were experiencing it, too.


By noon, the whole ward was complaining about stomach problems. Some were obviously legitimate, since some of the residents had forgotten how to use the facilities and we had to change them, but with the others, we assumed it was phantom pain.


The following day, Madge Daniels was found dead in her bed. Her roommate, Elizabeth Fong, said Madge had been having terrible nightmares all night. The state of Madges bed seemed to verify that claim. The sheets and blankets were torn off and Madge was clutching the pillow in a death grip. An autopsy was scheduled for later in the week.


The reports of stomach pain began to dwindle. Only three residents were still complaining, and they were legitimately sick with that virus. Nightmares were the new thing. Everyone was having them.


If you were to walk into the Alzheimers ward at 3am last Friday, you wouldve thought youd entered a torture chamber. The agonized screams of the residents as they encountered whatever demons haunted their dreams were hideous and disconcerting. Some had torn out their fingernails as they clawed at the bedclothes while others had fallen while attempting to leave their beds. It was a terrible scene.


Two nights ago, Veronica Auster-Coates began to talk about stomach pain again. The nurse was about to shrug it off, but she could see distension in Veronicas abdomen, even under her nightclothes. An exam was ordered, and emergency surgery followed. A mass the size of a basketball was removed from Veronicas ovary. There had been no indication of this mass at her most recent physical examination two weeks ago.


The nightmares continued. Doctors and nurses began to grow concerned. The violence of the dreams was unlike anything theyd encountered in the past. While the disease can cause vivid nightmares, these were unusual both in their severity and frequency. 


Yesterday morning, Madge Daniels autopsy was conducted. Her life had been taken by a massive stroke. That was not the unusual discovery.


Madge, who had gone through her 74 years of life without even needing glasses, had developed severe, burn-like scars on her eyes the night of her death.


Yesterday afternoon, the dissection of Veronica Auster-Coates ovarian growth was completed. It was filed as a rapid growth of carcinogenic cells, but no explanation was given. No explanation existed.


Last night, the power at the hospital went out. The backup generators did not kick in. I was out having a cigarette with the janitor on the roof when it happened, and we both saw diffuse, orange lights darting back and forth above the clouds. The moment they disappeared, the power came back on.


This morning, the hospital is on lockdown and the Alzheimers ward is under quarantine. All the residents woke up with burns which had destroyed their eyes. All the residents have basketball-sized distension of their abdomens. Further, the growth which had been excised from Veronica Auster-Coates is missing from the laboratory. The final straw, which prompted the lockdown of the hospital, was the discovery of the corpse of the lab technician who had been [studying it.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> I dont want to sound racist but I think Kevin is gay lol. Like, my parents were gone haha it seems like they always are and I got Kevin to come over to help me with homework and he was SO not interested in my boobs. I mean, I didnt show them to him or anything yet but I pushed my shoulders together and made them all big and all he did was look at the homework and then his brain fell out.


I got mad because it was on my new bedspread and its now just like bedspread with brain and it doesnt match the lavender color AT ALL KEVIN.


But yeah he was all sitting there looking weird and bleeding from the eye his brain fell out of and now hes making weird sounds. So not sexy Kevin. Srs.


Like, I dont want to even [ask you guys for advice anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4ho869/um_can_any_of_you_guys_tell_me_whats_wrong_with/?st=ivbamqdh sh=d65e3411) because youre so not helpful ([TOMMY IS FINE BY THE WAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5c2xzz/ok_now_my_brother_is_all_messed_up_and_gross_lol/?st=iwnnwacf sh=913f2fd7)) but okay yeah can someone tell me how to get a brain back into the boy I like?


Lol like sandwich. ^ ^


Before you get all Madison just pick it up and push it back in where it came out of Ill just say I already did that and I just made it worse. Brains are supposed to be one piece right? Yeah um well it plopped out in one piece but when I tried to push it back up his eye hole it, like, fell apart? Yeah.


Theres brain under my nails and I did them just so Kevin would think my fingers are sexy and I guess thats out of the realm of possibility lol. Unless hes into brainy fingers. People always tell me Im super smart.


So yeah. Kevins brain is all messed up. He doesnt seem happy because when I tried to unzip his pants to get a peek (Im not a perv I wanted to make sure he had enough air because hes breathing all weird) he grunted and pushed me. Omg if Dad saw him push me omg lol.


Im just gonna assume you wont have any good ideas about his brain. And you know what? I didnt expect any lol you guys are the worst. Jk jk jk youre not the worst like cancer is the worst. OH BTW


Kevins brain kinda came back together but it doesnt look like brain its more like a slug. Remember my cat? Yeah we got a new one. Mr. Flufferbottom was not fine after Tommy. Not fine at all. Anyway now we have a cat called Meowington and hes eating Kevin's brain slug thing. Kevin's walking around and bumping into stuff and stuff. His pants are still unzipped though. A girl can dream lolol no its okay he likes other guys I guess maybe Ill get a short haircut and he cant tell because he has no brain.


Ok, I guess Ill mention that one other thing.


You know my friend Danica I mentioned last time? Yeah, she was in my closet trying to record all the sex I was gonna have with Kevin before his brain got all clumsy. Anyway, I think it might have turned out Danica was pregs because she died or something and a baby ????????? like fell out of her.


You know how babies are supposed to be all cute and cuddly like stupid Tommy? Yeah, no. Danicas baby is like an octopus. But with people legs. With lots and lots of knees. And yeah its eating Danica. Which is so not baby food. Danica only ate junk food which is probably why she died Im gonna totally take her phone she has a 7 and I only have a 6s thanks Mom.


Im all trying to write this to you people and theres so much going on theyre interrupting the heck out of me. So Danica baby is done eating Danica and now it crawled in Kevins head and only one of the legs is sticking out his eye and Meowington finished eating the slug brain and is getting all hairbally and Kevin, bless his gay heart, is just sitting on the bed looking at me.


He looks so cute guys. I swear, if it wasnt for the weird baby leg flopping all over his face Id totally let him touch it. Jk Id still let him. Hang on.


No he didnt want to. Oh well. Guys Im so unlucky its really not fair. Im, like, really pretty. I know you pervs are gonna keep sending me pics of your things and I support your decision because you cant help yourselves but its not the same. I love Kevin. Kevin and his no brain and weird baby head. But its not meant to be.


You know what? Im gonna find Kevin a boyfriend. Then I bet hell love me back. [Bbl!!](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Saturday morning, there were long smudges on the glass of my front door. Three, thick, semi-parallel smudges from what looked like fingers. They trailed from the middle of the door down to its base, then disappeared. If they were from an animal, it wasnt any animal I knew about. If they were from a person, he was unfathomably deformed.


An hour later, I discovered nine dead deer behind my garage. Their eyes, sexual organs, and teeth were missing. I called animal control and was told there were mutilated animals being reported all over the county. They had no explanation, but I was assured the carcasses would be picked up before the weekend was over.


As I hung up, I heard something in the background on the phone line.


While I endeavored to shake the fear that had gripped me, I sat and tried to watch television. The picture was distorted. I flipped from channel to channel, only to encounter the same problem with the signal. For a moment, I thought I could make out something in the static interlacing the normal programming.


A shape.


Gooseflesh prickled my skin and my focus grew intense. I walked to the television and stared, trying to peer through the frames to whatever was on the other side. The distortion intensified and a form grew from the static. 


I realized the sound from the television had changed from the clipped, broken broadcast audio to waves of white noise. I heard nothing else. No birds, no insects, no hum of household electronics. Just the white noise and the pounding of my heartbeat in my ears. 


I was fixated on the shape. I couldnt determine what it was, but there was no doubt it was organic. It moved and undulated, getting closer to the screen before backing off. I was so close to the television I could see the pores in my skin reflected off the glossy surface. It distracted me momentarily. That was all it took; I saw something else reflected. Something behind me.


I whirled around and saw four of the dead deer propped up on the floor. They were arranged and stacked in an X shape; hooves to hooves. How they were able to hold that position was beyond me. The abyssal cavities of their empty eye sockets stared at nothing.


There was a sound in the kitchen and I jumped. As if startled as well, the deer toppled over in a sickening tangle of limbs. 


More noise from the adjacent room. Wet slapping. The breath caught in my throat and every old scar on my body, even the invisible ones, began to hurt. Pain radiated in waves, but never strongly enough to overtake the overwhelming terror and dread I felt.


Three long, fleshy objects poked around the corner. I knew immediately they were fingers. They waved in a sickening, serpentine pattern. Clusters of tiny, fungus-like eyestalks twitched at the end of each one. I wanted to run. I still dont know why I didnt.


The rest of its body came around the corner. It was a wide, quadrupedal creature. Its one arm remained outstretched with the long fingers extended, as if seeing and tasting the air. A cavernous hole opened at the center of its bulk. The ray of sunlight in which it stood clearly showed me countless moving parts within the hole, making me think of some sickening biological clockwork.


The fingers moved toward my face and I could smell their musty, rotten-mushroom aroma. I stared into the maw of the thing as the parts inside moved against each other, producing a terrifyingly-calming white noise. I opened my mouth to speak, but the three fingers slipped between my lips and pushed down my throat. I gagged and tried to escape, but I was being held in place. I could feel the eye-like protuberances growing down my esophagus. The creature walked toward me, the hole in its body opening wider.


From this new, closer view, I could see the inside was filled with what could only be described as pieces resembling the legs of crickets and grasshoppers, all moving together to produce the wash of white noise that had filled the room. But as I gagged and struggled to free myself, the sound changed. The movements in the hole shifted.


At first, it sounded like the white noise was growing harsher. But as the seconds passed, the timbre shifted toward something resembling speech. After another moment, that was exactly what it was.


Eight more of your days. Weve tasted your animals, and now we know them. Ive tasted your body, and now I know you.


I gasped as I felt tendrils squirming deeper inside me. A light outside began to glow dull red. I heard my next-door neighbor shriek from out in her yard.


You can be us soon. Can you taste me?


Pores in its fingers erupted and filled my mouth and esophagus and belly with thick, gray liquid. My eyes widened. The flavor was indescribable. The red light outside intensified.


Eight more days.


The fingers were pulled from my throat and I fell onto the hardwood floor. The light grew blinding, then it was gone. The creature was gone. Flies buzzed around the deer carcasses.


Fluid dripped down my chin and chest as I knelt and tried to right myself. The words, eight days remained in my head. 


My hands and fingers were numb. I glanced down and was positive the digits were longer than they had been. And now, almost two days later, its indisputable. This hospital is full of patients with unexplained deformities to their hands, as well as inexplicable growths in their mouths. Amidst the confusion and barely-managed hysteria, the sound of white noise is mixing in with the raised voices. 


Tiny sprouts are starting to lift the fingernails from their nail beds on my right hand. Even when my eyes are closed, Im beginning to see things from the perspective of that hand. See and taste. Six more days, if the creature was telling the truth. Six days. As the sound of white noise begins to overtake the normal speech, I find myself growing less concerned with every passing moment. Less concerned, and more [excited](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> *I bought these few pages at a local traders tent for the equivalent of $.25 USD. It was the only thing there written in English. I dont know what any of it means, but the fact it names the missing explorers and ruined village is troubling.*


**June 29th, 2016**


Let this be a journal of our last moments. I know we wont make it out.


**June 30th, 2016**


They took Jane last night. This morning, the trees have her eyes. All the trees; every knot hole, every space, every interstice, is stuffed with her eyes. Two eyes copied into thousands. I dont know how. Nothing makes sense. But theyre staring at us. Were being watched. They follow every one of our movements, as if they didnt already know what was going to happen. 


**July 1st, 2016**


The plants are choking us. Each step is harder and were stopping every 15 minutes to rest. Arts leg injury is worse. I wont even attempt to remove the fused plastic and metal of the phone from his hip and thigh. We can smell the wound putrefying. Theres no disputing hell die if we dont get him medical attention soon.


Thats a laughable fantasy at this point, though. Were countless miles away from anyone. No villages, no doctors, no anyone. Just unforgiving jungle. I can hear Art weeping as we walk.


**July 2nd, 2016**


I saw one of them in the river. It didnt notice us. It was gulping down thousands upon thousands of gallons of water. Where it kept it inside its skinny body was beyond me. All of this is beyond me.


Im covered in bites from mosquitos and spiders. I have a pressure wound beginning to form on my shoulder from propping up Art as we walk. Animals are starting to get his scent, and Ive shooed away carrion birds who land while he tries to sleep. I was lucky enough to kill one this morning. We can eat.


**July 3rd, 2016**


We cant go anywhere today. Art is immobile. I see something wriggling under the skin of his wound. I think it may be a botfly larva, but Im not sure. Its something. The remains of the phone are beginning to fall off as infected skin sloughs away. Its clear the burns are down to his hip and femur. He mutters as he sits there. I dont know if he can see me.


**July 4th, 2016**


I woke up to the sight of one of them near Art. I didnt move. I couldnt even if Id wanted to. As I watched, it traced its flaccid fingertips over Arts legs. They fell onto the leaves. I gasped, and it turned around to face me. We stared at each other for a little while, then it turned back to my friend. It picked the legs up and held them under its arm, near the leg stalks, and walked away.


Art was crying. There was no blood coming from the wounds. I could see the muscle and tendons and cross section of his femur, along with the pink marrow inside. The part with the melted phone was yellow and green with a reservoir of fluid beneath. Nothing dripped out. The wounds had been invisibly cauterized.


He is still dying.


**July 5th, 2016**


They took Art last night. His brown eyes have joined Janes blue ones in the trees. All the trees, now. They all watch.


**July 6th, 2016** 


There were six of them in the widest part of the river I passed, gorging themselves with water. The area of the river behind them had slowed to a trickle. Im not worried about them seeing me anymore. They know Im here. 


I saw the first village since the three of us departed. Its amazing to think just a week ago we were three. The village was transformed. Stone huts were covered in living, moving tissue. Muscle, from the look of it. Muscle and veins. The sound of something being inflated was filling the air as I went by. I didnt spend the time to look. From the remainder of the map I have, it looks like Im still a couple days from the nearest trading post.


**July 7th, 2016**


All eyes, no trees. Trunks of eyes, branches of eyes, leaves of eyes. Nothing but eyes. [Dry rivers.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> As Andrew got sicker, hed point to perceived smudges on our bedroom window. Nothing discernible to him. Not at first. But the decline in my partners health brought with it a growing realization. Its a face, he told me. Its someones face.


I saw nothing.


I sat with Andrew through it all. Every sleepless night. Every shriek of terror as nightmares tore through him. Every sobbing declaration that he wasnt ready. In the mornings, the smudged face would be there, ever clearer to him. He was terrified of it. Still, I saw nothing.


Time went by while Andrew wasted away. Id started staring more at the blackness beyond the window than at my dying partner. A portion of me found comfort in avoiding Andrews gaze. His was a gaze of sorrow. Of regret. He knew Id be facing the same fate in the coming years. I begged him not to concern himself with such a thing, but deep down, in the vault of my soul, I resented him. His carelessness. 


My own.


Id grip his hand in my own throughout our last week together. He didnt have the strength to talk. He could only wheeze and stare. Stare at me. Stare at the window. Stare at everything.


Soon nothing.


On his last night, he did nothing but stare at the blackness beyond the window. The void. His void. But then he lifted his arm and pointed. He coughed and whispered, I see him. I see death. They were the first words hed uttered in days. He continued.


Michael, do you see him?


I squeezed his hand and told him I loved him.


The face, Michael. Please, go look at the face. He saw I was doing nothing, then raised his voice, bringing on a series of horrible, unproductive coughs. Look!


I obliged. I walked to the window and peered out. There was nothing but black, cold emptiness below a ceiling of unforgiving stars.


Look!, he wheezed again.


I pressed my face to the cold glass and saw nothing. Nothing but darkness.


I turned around and Andrew began to sob.


Look, he whimpered. Tears drooled from his bloodshot eyes. Look.


I looked. I saw smudges.


Michael, please help. Hes here.


I pitied him with such ferocity that I began to bawl. Everything, our passion, our experiences, our closeness, was nearing the end. And it was beyond our control. My promise to be with him through it all was being broken by the force taking him from this world. I couldnt bear it.


This had to happen on our terms.


Im not ready, Michael, he whispered. I held a pillow over his face. He struggled and moaned, no no no no no, through the pillow and used his last energy to thrash. Then he stopped. Everything stopped.


I collapsed on the bed, cradled my love to my chest, and cried for what felt like hours. The sun was coming up when I rose from his deathbed and looked toward the window.


I saw the greasy print of my face smudged against the glass, with my lips curled into a hideous, skeletal grin. Deaths grin.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I followed the sound of buzzing. The deeper into the woods I went, the louder the sound became. It was dark this far in; there were remnants of structures from industrial-era factories long neglected and choking with trees, vines, and countless other plants. Judging from the level of growth, no one had been here in a very, very long time.


The buzzing persisted. It became hard to walk through the underbrush. I spotted, or rather felt, a swarm of insects. They flew by my ear, paying me no attention, save for one. He flew into the back of my neck and instinctively stung me. I pulled his writhing body off my neck and studied him. It was a bumblebee, fat and covered with pollen. More streaked by. They were going in the direction of the sound.


I walked on, feeling a strange sensation of diminished weight as I progressed. The steps became easier. I could leap through the brush with increasing ease - so long as it was in the direction of the buzzing. My attempts to walk backward were met with more resistance than I would have considered normal. I realized the plants were pointing toward the source of the the buzzing, as if theyd grown that way.


When I reached a clearing, there was an old, dilapidated warehouse at the center. Despite the trees no longer blocking the sun, the light was dim. I stared up into the buzzing sky and realized clouds of bees were pouring toward the warehouse. Countless thousands. Countless millions. All flying toward the hole in metal roof. 


Snowflakes of clumped pollen, likely shed from the bees bodies, blew across the clearing and accumulated around the edges of the warehouse. There was a distinct pull on me now; an undeniable force tugging me toward the structure. I didnt fight it.


I reached the warehouse and looked around for an entrance. There were a few, but they were still locked from the inside. Near the back, I found a hole. It was small, but large enough for me to fit through. I was covered in pollen from head to toe; the cloying particulate matter forcing sneeze after sneeze out of me. Tears ran down my cheeks.


The buzzing was bordering on overwhelming. Id entered into a closet or maintenance area, so I still couldnt see what was happening. I opened the door and the force pulled the knob from my hand and the door slammed backward into the wall. But I didnt notice the slam. Nor would I have cared if I did.


At the center of the warehouse, there was a tiny, black dot. I felt disoriented looking at it and had to hold on to the door frame to keep my footing. The light around it shimmered. And bees poured into it. It was a ceaseless torrent of bees, all disappearing inside. 


It made no sense. None of it. I would have stayed longer, but I noticed something happening in the area around the dot. More light shimmered. Part of me thought it was a black hole, but I quickly dismissed such a ridiculous idea. But I couldnt figure it out. 


Until I did.


The light shimmered again, and a colossal, veiny eye opened above the dot. Then another one. A face came into view, showing the dots nature: a mouth. The eyes glared at me as it inhaled more and more bees and pollen. I turned and ran, fighting against the terrible suction until I was out of the clearing and far away. 


The bees never stopped flying toward the [warehouse](http://unsettlingstories.com). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fingernails were the first to go.


No pain accompanied the loss; the victims went to sleep one night and simply woke up without fingernails. The events occurred in Donglu village, located in China's Shandong Province. There are limited medical resources, so few sought treatment. The affected went about their lives. 


Teeth came next.


In Pinellas County, Florida, between November 3rd and 16th, 19 people checked themselves into local hospitals and reported they had woken up with jaw pain, bleeding gums, and missing teeth. They were all wisdom teeth. No one could explain what had happened.


On November 20th, 82 people in Lahore, Pakistan woke up without arms and legs. 


On November 22nd, four people in Ottawa, Canada, were found dead in their beds. Their hearts, lungs, and rib cages were missing. There was no sign of struggle at any of the scenes. Two of the victims were found by their spouses in the mornings. They claimed to have noticed nothing overnight.


On November 23rd, close to 15,000 people in South and Central America died. Autopsies revealed the entire digestive tracts had been removed. There were no cuts, incisions, or injuries that could explain the excisions. 


I work aboard a meteorological vessel for the United States Navy. Weve watched these reports trickle in over the last few weeks. Ordinarily, we wouldnt be privy to the details of the situations I described. Quite the contrary; authorities have gone through great pains to shield the public from the ongoing events. 


Theres a thread which unifies each event, however.


Our weather satellites have noticed an inordinate number of red sprites in the upper atmosphere. On the nights of the mutilations, above each affected region, the red sprite activity has been greater than anything wed seen in the past. Usually only associated with severe thunderstorms, these sprites are showing up over even the most modest cloud cover. 


On November 28th, a fishing village in Sardinia, Italy, notified authorities about a red tint in the seawater. Fearing an algae bloom, tests were run. Not algae. Blood. Countless millions of gallons from innumerable species of animals.


Later that night, red sprites danced above Sardinia lower than theyd ever been observed. We saw them in the distance. Our ship is in the Mediterranean. 


Yesterday, November 29th, three of our onboard scientists - the three working most directly with the sprite/mutilation connection - died at their posts. One second they were working, the next they were face down on their desks, bleeding. Immediate autopsies were ordered. All the brain matter inside their heads was gone.


Late last night, I was on deck smoking a cigarette. Sprites danced and darted overhead as a storm gathered. Its intensity grew faster than our models had anticipated. Lightning and thunder crashed, but no rain fell. 


Lightning illuminated the sea around us and a sailor noticed something in the distance. He called to the captain, who ordered the ship lights be trained on the object. They were. A hulking shape, perhaps a quarter mile away, floated in the choppy sea. Behind the sounds of roaring wind and thunder, we heard it bellowing. The sound was low and chilling. Inexplicable. Alien.


The water below us reddened and tubes of viscera floated to the surface. They flapped and writhed against the against the hull of the ship. Lungs and stomachs and bladders and hearts at the end of each intestinal tube throbbed and pulsated. More bellowing. More moaning. 


A flash from a red sprite and a clap of thunder made everyone jump. The floating object was gone. The storm was dissipating. The bloody water was diluting back to its normal shade.


I havent been able to sleep since then. All I can do is fill out my reports, write this account, and watch as tens of thousands of dead fish float to the surface. We havent been allowed to notify the families of our dead colleagues. Not while all this is still going on, we were told. And just a moment ago, we were alerted to sprite activity over [New York City](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TITLE> Eavesdropping through an IP camera. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-29 16:47:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A couple years back, there was a software flaw in a few webcam brands. Whenever they were active, they could be accessed by scanning the Internet for a particular open port. Once the port was found, anyone could tune in without the user knowing they were being watched. And millions of people used these webcams.


The companies quickly released software hotfixes, but no one, aside from a few tech-savvy folks, updated their webcam software. So even today, they broadcast everything they do in front of their computer to anyone whos voyeuristic enough to watch. People like me.


Im not proud of my fascination, but I wont pretend it isnt there - and I wont lie and claim I didnt indulge it for a while. I watched thousands of people all over the world doing everything: laughing, sobbing, clipping toenails, masturbating, puking, doing homework, exercising, etc. It was all a thrill. None of them had any idea.


A few nights ago, I was snooping in on what looked like a greenhouse. The IP address was somewhere in North Carolina, but thats never completely accurate. Either way, it looked like the camera was being used for security, as it overlooked the whole area.


There were two people working; on what, I couldnt tell. But it became clear that one of them was in a bit of distress. Something on the table where they were working had latched onto his glove and they were both trying to brush it off.


The camera didnt have a zoom feature, but I was able to use my browser to enhance the size. It didnt do much; it just blurred and got even grainier. Still, I could make out what looked like a plant growing up the guys hand. Whatever I was seeing, it was infinitely more interesting than anything on any of the other cameras that night.


The two guys succeeded in getting the glove off. The wearer seemed fine, but he was pacing back and forth, as if he were excited or scared or anxious. Made sense to me; if a plant had latched onto my hand while I was working, Id be a combination of all those things.


One of them used a pair of tongs to pick up the glove and placed it into what looked like a fish bowl or terrarium. Then he did something I didnt expect: he turned around, reached into a cage I hadnt noticed, and pulled out a large, white rat. He dropped it into the tank with the glove.


Even though the resolution was terrible, I could see whatever was on the glove grab the rat. The animal jumped and rolled around before going still. The plantlife crept over its body. It didnt move.


The two guys were typing something on their respective computers. I couldnt see any of it. It looked like they were taking notes.


All that went on for about five minutes. I assumed the rat was dead. Then something happened. At first, I thought it was just a line of distorted video. But the harder I looked, I saw it wasnt. Something was growing out of the top of the rats head. And the rat was moving again.


One of the men picked up the cage and put it on a table much closer to the camera. Right then, I could see exactly what was happening. 


More of the plant grew from the rats head until it was sticking up about a foot and a half. Its eyes bulged, and the plant emerged from the sockets. The rat started to walk. It would back up, walk in a straight line, bump into the side of the tank, then try again; over and over and over as more of the plant emerged from its skull. Then it shook itself. A cloud of something spread throughout the tank before settling.


One of the guys appeared in the frame again. This time, he was wearing a full-body protective suit. He picked up the rat and placed it on the floor, then opened the door to the greenhouse. The animal hesitated for a second, then ran outside.


Nothing else of note really happened after that. I dont know what it was that I saw, but Ive been checking on the camera every so often over the last couple days. The same things would happen; a rat would get put in a tank with a portion of plant life, and the plant would grow from it. Once it shook that particulate matter from itself, it would be let outside.


This morning, when I checked the camera, the two guys were there again. One of them, the one who had his glove covered, didnt look particularly healthy. His skin was covered with blotches. The oversaturated color from the camera made them look bright red, almost like the skin was missing. Still, he did the same as hed done each time: plant sample - rat - rat shakes - release.


There was more light this morning, so I even got a chance to make out what was coming out of the rats head. Its weird to think about, but Im almost certain. Skinny, white mushrooms. 


I fucking hate [mushrooms](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TITLE> Stuffing </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-22 18:04:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There was something unbelievable about the stuffing my grandmother made every Thanksgiving. It wasnt just good - it was beyond amazing. Every morsel of meat and bread and vegetable was flavored to perfection. The meticulousness and love involved in the preparation process shone through with every bite. Wed eat until we were stuffed (pun intended) and still felt great afterward. Hell, we even felt invigorated, which was the last thing one would expect after Thanksgiving dinner.


Our family had been trying to get her to tell us the recipe for years. She wouldnt even give us a hint.


Since our family has always had a love for dark humor, when were around the Thanksgiving table, we liked to speculate on how she did it. My sister thought she mixed in crack cocaine. My father said she sold her soul to Satan in 1955. Even Mom, who was the least indecorous of the group, quietly said, around a mouthful of stuffing, I bet its made from the bodies of better chefs.


We all laughed. Especially Grandma. Then we had a little moment of sad silence. Grandpa had been a chef. Hed passed away over the summer. Everyone missed him. 


Dad broke the silence with a truly spectacular belch, and we all groaned and giggled and got back to eating.


Even though Id resumed packing my mouth with mashed potatoes, I still felt bad for my grandmother. Shed taken Grandpas death very hard. Even with her network of friends, family, and coworkers at the place where she volunteers, her loneliness was obvious. Seeing her smiling with us on Thanksgiving warmed my heart. It felt good to hear her laugh again, and it was obvious she was happy that we loved her stuffing as much as we did.


The Friday after last Thanksgiving, Id finished my Black Friday shopping and was bringing my nieces presents over to Grandmas. It was tradition for us to go there on Christmas morning to open our gifts. I wanted to get an early start so I wouldnt have to deal with last-minute shopping. 


When I arrived, Grandma wasnt there. I figured she was doing her volunteering, since its always busy there around the holidays. I had a key, though, and I let myself in.


Her house was as neat and perfect as ever. I left the packages in the living room, and was about to leave through the kitchen when a truly sinister thought crossed my mind. I was finally going to get that stuffing recipe.


I opened her recipe book and there, between souffle and tandoori chicken, was stuffing. I read it over and my heart sank.


It was almost completely unremarkable. The recipe looked like any ingredient list from the back of a stuffing box. There was only one thing I didnt recognize right away:  cup STC. I scratched my head for a second, then realized it was an abbreviation for salt, turmeric, and cumin. After all those years of wondering, it all came down to Grandma just being a really, really good cook. I shouldve known.


Its been almost a year since then. The familys been gearing up for another Thanksgiving. The menu is planned, the tablescape is designed, and the guests have been invited.


Yesterday, out of the blue, I got a call from my mom. Her mother, a.k.a. my grandmother, had been arrested. I couldnt believe it and asked what had happened. Mom replied that shed been caught stealing from the place where she volunteers. They had security camera footage and everything.


To say I was confused was a massive understatement. First off, how could my grandmother, the kindest, sweetest person Ive ever met, be a thief? And second, what the hell is there to steal from where she volunteers?


Mom went to the police station to deal with the situation while I stayed at home and cleaned. I couldnt stop thinking about what had happened. As far as my first concern, I chalked it up to Grandma getting old. Maybe shed gotten confused and had taken something without even knowing it didnt belong to her. That had to have been it, and it made me sad to think about. 


Mom called me an hour or so later. Shed bailed Grandma out and was waiting for it all to get processed so she could take her to the hospital to get examined. I asked Mom what the hell was going on.


She told me it was pretty much exactly what wed thought. Grandma had taken something from her volunteer place and snuck it away. The security office even rolled tapes back and caught her doing the same thing for the last eight years, all right around Thanksgiving.


What the hell did she take?, I asked, so overwhelmed with confusion that I wanted to tear my hair out.


Well, thats why Im bringing her to the hospital, Mom replied. Not just because I think she might be losing it, but because it was just waste that the place incinerates anyway.


I felt a chill start at the back of my neck and plunge down my spine. Like...medical waste?, I asked in a hollow, detached voice.


Yeah. Biohazard stuff.


I thanked Mom for calling and said to let me know if there was anything I could do to help. We hung up.


I sat there in the quiet house and put seemingly-impossible pieces together. The stuffing. The feeling of invigoration. The recipe. Everything in the room blurred and my mouth felt very, very dry.


STC wasnt salt, turmeric, and cumin. Not even close to salt, turmeric, and cumin. 


STC was stem cells. 


Grandma was a volunteer at [Planned Parenthood](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im chef Geoffrey Zakarians personal espresso maker and latte-foam artist. Yes, thats a real job. With benefits, in fact. Great health and dental.


One of the perks of my occupation, aside from hanging out with GZ and getting to eat many of my weekly meals at his outstanding restaurant, The Lambs Club, is the access I enjoy at The Food Networks studios and associated properties. 


GZ is a pretty big deal over there, which Im sure you know if youve watched the network for more than a few hours. Aside from Chopped!, which is his best-known show, hes building a new audience with the Saturday morning feature, The Kitchen. His personality fits so well with whatever hes in, though, and its just great to be a part of it.


Im totally fanboying right now. Sorry. I hope that doesnt sound disrespectful in the face of what happened.


GZ was shooting a few episodes of Chopped! with Aarn Sanchez, Marc Murphy, Alex Guarnaschelli, and Amanda Freitag. Ted Allen had just gotten there a bit late but immediately started poking fun at Aarn for a new tattoo on his hand that looked a little like a dick. (It totally did.)


I was in the backstage prep kitchen setting up Geoffreys personal Elektra Belle Epoque espresso machine. Id shown him the preliminary designs for the three lattes Id be making over the course of the days film schedule. Out of the 28, he chose *Spring*, by Pierre-Auguste Cot, *Seated Woman with a Red Kerchief*, by Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, and my favorite, *La Vrit sortant du puits arme de son martinet pour chtier l'humanit*, by Jean-Lon Grme. Id save that one for last.


The first episode of the day went well. A Nigerian-born British chef led the way throughout, and it was no surprise that he won. After it was over and they were setting up for the next show, GZ brought me a piece of the truly-outstanding bread pudding dessert thatd clinched the win. Laphroaig scotch-soaked brioche sounds wrong, but in that chefs capable hands, it was transcendental.


The four chefs waiting in the wings for the next episode were called onstage. Ted gave the rules in his inimitable style, and GZ, Amanda, and Alex sat at the judging table, trying not to laugh. If only the TV viewers knew how hard it was to maintain the air of seriousness the show tries to project.


Anyway, the appetizer round went pretty well. It was obvious the lady from Westport was going to get chopped, since she left out two basket ingredients while trying to make some weird fritters out of mussels and kale. Sure enough, when Ted lifted the cloche, her appetizer was under it. She didnt even thank the judges for the opportunity to compete.


The entree round came next, after the crew cleaned the chefs stations. I was hard at work on *Spring*, but I kept glancing up at the monitors in the prep kitchen to see what was going on.


Right as Ted announced there were only five minutes left, I heard Ted and the judges gasp. Apparently one of the the chefs had cut himself. 


Now, anyone whos watched Chopped! knows that chefs cut themselves all the time. It adds an extra element of suspense to the show as they have to wait for the EMT to bandage the wound and secure a glove, then they have to work through the pain and make sure not to get any blood on the food.


This cut was really bad. The problem was, the chef wouldnt stop. Something was very, very wrong. GZs second latte was forgotten as I stared at the live feed from the studio monitors. All the other chefs stopped what they were doing as the EMT crew tried to attend to the chef. His name was Evan.


Evan was clearly disturbed. He shouted, homemade sausage wins the round 87.2% of the time! Round one was close but this one will be a cut above! He laughed hysterically and waved the knife at any approaching EMT. One of the producers came into the prep kitchen and dialed 911.


My eyes were glued to the monitor. GZ was calling to Evan and trying to talk some sense into him. He said he was a great chef and that hed been to his restaurant before and really loved the Homard en Crote. Evan didnt acknowledge, so Aarn tried. He said something about being really proud of the work hes done and it reminded him of himself when he was younger. No response, just frenzied cooking and prepping of the meat grinder.


Alex cried.


A pan Evan had been heating was smoking hot. To everyones dismay, he yelled reduce by 25%, then carved between his index and middle fingers all the way down to his wrist. Everyone except Evan screamed. Blood poured into the pan and steam erupted from the hot surface. The odor of boiling blood filled the studio. One of the prep chefs next to me puked into the sink.


Another EMT tried to grab Evan while he was busy cutting, but Evan reacted quickly and slashed the mans shoulder. Not deep, but enough to make sure the EMT didnt try anything again.


Oh no, I heard Aarn moan. Alex shrieked. The blood steam had fogged the monitors camera, so I couldnt see anything. I stepped out from backstage and saw why they were so distraught. Evans hand was gradually disappearing into the meat grinder. 


GZ and I locked eyes and he just shook his head. I nodded. I felt bad for the guy. Horrified, but still sympathetic. 


More and more of the mans hand disappeared into the grinder. This wouldve never worked with the terrible meat grinders they had throughout the majority of the shows history. Those things wouldnt grind a sheet of paper. These were new, though, and they were powerful. As we watched, Evans arm disappeared up to the elbow as bloody confetti poured out and filled the bowl on the table.


The fire alarm sounded. Apparently some panicking intern had pulled it thinking itd get the authorities there faster. 


Form into patties and braise in blood sauce with thyme, carrots, diced shallots, and fennel pollen, Evan called out over the din of the alarm. Add chocolate and poblanos to create a pseudo-mole sauce to ingratiate Sanchez and Freitag if they are judging. Add butter for Guarnaschelli. Add veal demi-glace for Zakarian.


Evans arm had disappeared up to his shoulder. He wrenched the stump out. Pulped flesh dangled while blood spurted. His complexion was beige.


Follow the braising with a quick sear. Plate with potatoes if Murphy is judging. Marc was busy throwing up into a trashcan. 


The studio door burst open and four police officers entered the studio. Evan had dropped the knife and was busy making patties out of the meat thatd once been his hand and arm. Bone fragments may be overlooked if the flavor profile is strong enough, he yelled, and began to drop the patties into the pan of reduced blood. He then added the aromatics hed cut up before going nuts.


A scent filled the air. I was overwhelmed by the most disturbing sensation Id ever experienced; the smell was intoxicating and luscious. Everyone stopped shouting and crying and puking as their nostrils filled with the rich odor. A cop shot Evan with a taser, and Evan collapsed on the bloody floor. He convulsed for a moment, then stopped. The EMTs ran to him.


One of the producers turned off the burners and ordered all nonessential personnel to leave immediately. I looked at GZ and he pointed at his watch. I was six minutes late with his latte. Of course hed be thinking about his latte at a time like this.


I went in back and began the laborious process again. *Spring* was a no-go. I wasnt about to try to do it over, so I prepared *La Vrit sortant du puits arme de son martinet pour chtier l'humanit*. I hoped it would put GZ in a happier mood, if that was at all possible.


The $20,000 espresso machine hummed and I deftly painted the milk foam and espresso into the objet d'art we both loved. I listened as the EMTs took Evan out and the police questioned the chefs. It didnt take long. They left right when I was about to finish. 


I came out onto the set with the latte and stopped dead in my tracks. My hands trembled and part of me knew my artwork was being destroyed, but that was the least of my concerns at that moment.


Geoffrey, Aarn, Marc, Ted, Alex, and Amanda stood around Evans station. They huddled in front of the pan, each holding a fork. Each of them was cutting off small portions of the terrible sausage Evan had made and eating it. Overcome with nausea, I dropped the latte. Everyone looked at me.


Jesus Christ man, GZ complained. Was that the Grme one?


I nodded.


His expression softened. Sorry, I didnt ask if you were okay. You good?


I nodded again as he took another morsel of the sausage.


Look, I know this looks strange and we all admit well probably feel pretty bad about it tomorrow, but when else are we going to have a chance like this?


Aarn chimed in, Cmon buddy, give it a try.


The other judges joined Aarn and GZ and encouraged me over. It still smelled spectacular. GZ cut me a tiny piece and I put it in my mouth. It was the best thing Id ever tasted.


Hey, is that camera still on,? Alex asked around a mouthful of carrot and sausage.


Hmm, yeah, said Amanda, staring at the green light.


Guess its one for the blooper reel, GZ laughed. For Chopped! After Hours.


They all laughed and I backed away, not sure how to feel.


Hey, GZ interrupted, anyone want a latte?


Ted belched. Fuck yeah.


I went backstage and started to make their lattes. As I was turning the corner, Alex quipped, yeah, that guy totally wouldve won the round. If he lives, maybe we should send him a card. 

They all thought that was a superb [idea](http://unsettlingstories.com).

I saw it when I was 12, and it had such a profound effect on me that *to this day*, 23 years later, the sight of fingerprints on a rain-streaked window makes me shudder. I cannot see a red light in the sky without a brief, but undeniable feeling like something is coming for me. 

I don't even know if it's that great a movie, to be honest. I've seen it maybe twice. But its effect has been indelible. I definitely recommend you give it a shot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They come for me in broad daylight.


Over the last few years, they had removed nine toes, 12 teeth, one finger, and three feet of my large intestine. There are no scars. They leave no other evidence. They take what they want and leave me with less and less each time. Every visit diminishes me.


People cant see them. Dogs can, though. Cats, too. Maybe birds. Theyll howl or hiss or fly away, but that wont deter the visit. From what Ive learned, nothing will.


My right thumb was taken four days ago. I was walking to the supermarket when I felt the telltale prickles of static electricity cascading down the back of my head and neck. Pigeons in the area began to screech. The sense of weightlessness Id grown to know and dread swept over me, and as I was lifted into the clear sky, I saw my replacement continue his walk. He always continues exactly where Id left off.


The people walking behind me didnt notice a thing.


I know the long pull skyward is an illusion; perhaps even one for my benefit. That they can instantaneously place my replacement is proof of some kind of teleportation capability, but perhaps the sensation of travel is their way of easing my mind. If so, its a strange way of doing it. Moments later, Ill feel the agony of every incision and every amputation as their machines work. Despite their best efforts, I am not, and never again will be, at ease.


After my first abduction, I was deposited where my replacement had been. The physical transition was seamless, but the mental and emotional ones were not. For those sitting in the room with me, I went from laughing at a joke to shrieking and pulling off my shoes and socks to reveal my missing pinky toe. It was my abductors first souvenir. 


At the hospital, my checkup yielded no issues. None whatsoever, in fact. I appeared to be in perfect physical health, save for the missing toe. I was unsurprised when they wouldnt believe what I claimed had happened to me. I was kept overnight for observation, then given a prescription for anti-anxiety medication and discharged. 


Ive been back to the hospital over a dozen times since. The doctors began to realize something was happening. They noticed the perfect, seamless amputations and extractions of parts of me that previous x-rays showed were quite present at the time of the scans. 


The medical professionals were at a complete loss.


As I mentioned, four days ago, my right thumb was taken. I didnt go to the hospital after I was deposited back into the kitchen of my home. 


Three days ago, I lost my left hand. I was deposited back into my shower. The stump below my wrist was clean, white, and smooth. I did not go to the hospital.


Two days ago, my penis and testicles were excised. The agony of their amputation was exquisite, hideous, and profound. The pain disappeared when I was returned. I immediately went to the hospital, where I remain. The head of the hospital made many, many calls. No more than a few hours later, I was visited at my bedside by people in black suits. They made me sign documents that Im invalidating as I type this.


Before dawn this morning, I was taken again. It was the first time I was abducted at night. It was also the first time I saw the faces of my abductors. 


To attempt to explain the sheer, incomprehensible horror of their appearance would only blunt the reality of their form. No words exist in any human language to describe the feeling that laying my eyes upon them had evoked. The word incomprehensible dwarfs the word horror, and Id never felt so frightened in my life. 


Not until mere hours ago.


When I was returned, I knew nothing had been taken. The machines that had stolen so much of me had not been used. Something new had been employed. Something worse. Something alive.


I was swapped with my replacement and found myself where Id been beforehand: my hospital bed. I began to scream with a force that caused blood vessels in my eyes to burst. Before anyone could arrive, I started to feel what had been done to me. 


They didnt question my demand that they scan me. They didnt even hesitate. And when it was over, no one spoke. No one even looked at me. Their eyes were glued to the screens. Two pairs of them began to leak tears down horrified faces. That was all the confirmation I needed.


Im typing this with the laptop Id been given to compose my last will and testament. But I have nothing to give and no one to give it to. This is more important. 


Please realize that during my most recent abduction, I saw many, many other people who had been taken. People of all ages and races from what appeared to be all over the world. And they were all undergoing the same procedure.


I dont know how much longer I have. By the looks on the faces of the hospital officials and doctors who saw the scans, I cant imagine its very long. Right now, if thousands of people around the world are experiencing what I am, things will get very bad, very soon. While I wasnt given the opportunity to see the scans, I have all the evidence I need. 


All six pairs of clawed legs are scratching at my abdomen from the inside. I can see my skin rising and falling as the pressure against it grows and whats inside gets stronger. No one, aside from doctors, hospital officials, and suited men, remains in the hospital. Everyone else has been evacuated. 


Believe my account or choose to ignore it. Its entirely your choice. I wont be around for whatever happens next, but you will. Right now, I feel more of me being taken as teeth inside me are beginning to chew. Its going to happen soon, and something tells me its going to all go very quickly from there. Spots of blood are seeping through the sheet covering my belly.


Please be [ready](http://unsettlingstories.com).

I watch a lot of Food Network, so I'm used to hearing an enormous amount of descriptive terms used to describe meals or recipes. As odd as it sounds, I think that technique has sunk in. 

If I'm writing about, say, a rotting corpse, I'll be like, "hmm, how would Guy Fieri describe something gooey and bubbly and pungent?" (Please keep in mind I'm being dead serious right now.) I think doing it that way helps, because it applies some weird level of experiential knowledge to what you're trying to write, despite not necessarily having experience with, in this case, a rotting corpse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The overly-wide, grinning mouth is a horror cliche. Its a trope, albeit a successful one, thats wormed its way into scary stories from around the world. So ubiquitous is its inclusion that its taken on a legendary status; it feels like something thats always been around to scare people. Right?


In 1844, one of the first serial killers in Connecticut began a rampage. Little was known about the killer, save for their signature technique of disfiguration. While the victims were alive, they amputated their cheeks. When the bodies were eventually found, their toothy, skeletal smiles became fodder for nightmares, rumors, and legends. The killer was never captured.


Starting in 2012, local Connecticut message boards and forums started to feature messages and questions about ghosts.


Theres a town in Connecticut called Monroe. It is infested with hauntings. Two cemeteries, Union and Stepney, are sites where ghosts can be found wandering between headstones and sometimes out into the road. In November, 2012, there was an enormous uptick in the number of sightings, which precipitated the message board posts.


Those who saw the ghosts began having nightmares. 


Those who read about the ghosts began having nightmares.


The nightmares themselves were unique, save for one, shared feature: they ended with the dreamer thinking they woke up, then seeing a white, ghostly woman with devastating facial disfigurements crouching on their chests. Shell stare at them and trace her fingertips across their faces as she grins with her hideous, wide smile.


Its not unusual for cultural events to shape the content of dreams. Following the release of the movie The Exorcist, it was widely reported that people were having dreams about demonic possession. These reports of the ghostly woman are likely tied to the prevalence of the scary stories I mentioned above, along with the sightings of so-called ghosts.


I believed that for a little while.


Then I started having the dreams. My kids and wife did, too. Each night, Id watch, paralyzed, as the woman sat on my chest and touched my face. Id wake from the nightmare sweating and experiencing pain in my cheeks and chin. Soon after, the kids would start to scream.


Online searches for the identity of the 19th century serial killer have gone through the roof over the years, according to Googles list of trends. Other trends have started to show up, too.


Facial pain.


Difficulty swallowing.


Temporomandibular Joint Disorder symptoms.


Facial eczema.


Maybe its just my own paranoia, which, I admit, is growing by the day, but I can swear people around here are smiling more often. Theyre joyless smiles, but smiles nonetheless. My wife, whose stern, no-nonsense expression is legendary at the school where she teaches, now has smile lines creasing the corners of her mouth. And theyre turning redder as the days, weeks, and months go by.


My kids have always been relatively cheerful; even when theyre bored or tired, you can still see a spark of positivity in their eyes. That spark is gone. But their smiles are as wide as ever. Wider, maybe.


The local Connecticut message boards are buzzing about a find someone made regarding the serial killer from 1844. Apparently there was a chest from a Monroe church that had been given to the historical society in the 1980s. It was never opened and remained in the historical society basement for 30 years. The other day, on a whim, someone opened it.


Contained within were the musings of an old nun. Musings on positivity. On happiness. On smiles. And there were drawings of people with impossibly-wide grins. 


A knife was found, wrapped in cloth, tucked into the corner of the chest. Underneath it was a small bag filled with bloody fingernail clippings.


This morning, before dawn, I had the dream again. She was on me. For the first time, I noticed the heavy cross around her neck. She caressed my face like shed always done, but this time her fingernails began to scrape and scratch against my skin. It tickled, then it hurt. It hurt very badly. I tried to struggle, but I couldnt wake up. I couldnt get her off. The sound of a bloodcurdling scream exploded through my dream, and I woke up. The woman disappeared.


I looked at my wife in bed next to me. She was screaming as she slept. I watched as the corners of her mouth split, and with a sickening crunch, I heard her jaw dislocate. Blood poured down on the sheets as I grabbed her and tried to pull her out of bed and back into the waking world.


Down the hall, I heard my kids shriek with pain.


A half hour later, we arrived at the hospital. It was full of people bleeding from wounds on their cheeks. Some were worse than others. The place is overwhelmed, and I dont know what to do. Even as we bleed, were all [smiling](http://unsettlingstories.com).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Suicide Woods </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Everyones heard of the so-called Suicide Forest in Japan, but hardly anyones familiar with the locally-named Suicide Woods in Fairfield, CT. Its probably a good thing, too; the deaths are disturbing not only by their nature, but because there have been so many of them over the years. 


Growing up, I heard scary stories about the woods behind Lake Mohegan. We all did. Rumors of devil-worshipping cults ran like wildfire through every school hallway and cafeteria. Some kid said he was fishing back there with his uncle when they discovered a dead goat by a rock face with its guts arranged in a pentagram. Another kid talked about bloodsucking demons in the trees. Our parents were always quick to dispel the more ridiculous rumors, but they couldnt deny the suicides. The suicides were facts of life in our town.


I wouldnt be writing this if I thought it was an unfortunate, but natural, phenomenon - like with the forest suicides in Japan. To be honest, Id forgotten about it all until I came back for my 30th high school reunion last spring. A few old classmates and I got to talking, and we decided to take a hike through the wooded area the following day.


Keep in mind, the place is absolutely gorgeous. Its heavily wooded, but well-maintained paths run throughout. A clear, clean river cuts through the woods, and a series of cascades and rapids terminate in a deep, tranquil pool. Kids and families would swim there frequently during the summer, despite the unpleasant stigma of suicides and hauntings hanging over the area. On a beautiful, hot summer day, its simply too pretty over there to worry about that stuff.


We headed out around 7:30 the following morning. Only one of our original six ended up actually answering the phone and still wanted to go, but that was fine with me. Todd Soto and I were pretty close in high school, so I was looking forward to spending the morning with him so we could catch up.


We walked along the scenic path around the lake and into the woods. We followed the river, and soon we reached the cascades. The rushing water was gorgeous and invigorating. Someone whod gotten up even earlier than we had was fishing off the rocks. He waved, and we greeted him in turn.


The woods quieted as we progressed further upriver. The sound of wildlife replaced the rushing water. It was a truly spectacular day. Todd told me about his business and his family while I discussed my writing career and waning popularity. All in all, we were having a great time.


Todd stopped to grab some water from his backpack, and I gazed out over the now-distant lake. I heard my friend behind me rummaging through his stuff, then he muttered, what the hell? I turned around.


A hair-thin stream of black fluid had fallen out of the tree onto Todd. Hed moved to the side, but it was on his head and neck. We both looked up, but couldnt see what had produced the stream. Well thats gross, Todd remarked, and he reached into his backpack for a handkerchief. 


I kept looking in the tree while Todd wiped himself off. He went to put the handkerchief back, then pulled his Swiss Army knife from his pocket. It was one of the really big ones that Id wanted to get for a while. I was jealous.


Hey, cool kni--, I began, but then something happened. It was very bad, and very fast.


Todd opened the knife, and with no hesitation, plunged it into the side of his neck. A brilliant fountain of blood erupted from the puncture. His mouth formed a hideous smile of calm beneficence. His knees wobbled a bit, but he didnt fall. 


I shouted his name and rushed forward, but he pushed me away. Hard. I crashed onto the dirt and scrambled to my feet. Todd was now standing directly underneath the tree thatd dripped on him. He pulled the knife across the softest parts of his neck, while gurgling, What was mine is now yours. I repay your kiss with my blood. Take it all. Swallow me.


Once more, I tried to stop him, but got pushed away again. But not by Todd. Something had descended from the tree and was dangling in front of my friend. It was long and black and streaked with gray veins and white blotches. It was no wider than a cigarette lighter, but when it struck me, its strength was enormous. I knew at least one of my ribs had cracked, and I remained on the ground, clutching my chest.


The thing spasmed and twitched before touching down on Todds gouting throat. A lime-green proboscis slid from its tip and began lapping up the blood. Todd had fallen to his knees, but he was still carving his neck ever wider. His grinning mouth moved in the same shapes of the words hed been gurgling, but nothing but blood came out. Soon that also stopped, as he severed his esophagus. Then he fell on his face.


The thing in the tree extended and pushed down into Todds wound. For minutes, I stared, too horrified to move, as it gulped my friends blood. Its veins pulsed and it swelled obscenely before turning translucent, then transparent, then invisible. I heard the leaves rustling as it retracted back, and all that was left was me and my dead friend. 


I pulled myself to my feet and ran, wincing with agony as the broken ends of my ribs rubbed against one another. I reached for my phone, but realized Id given it to Todd to hold in his backpack. I kept running until I reached the road. I flagged down a car and had them call the police.


They arrived and brought me to the station. I was questioned and I told them everything, despite knowing how insane it sounded. They asked for my phone number and home address so they could contact me if they needed anything else. Days went by. They didnt call. They didnt visit. After a week, I went online to the Connecticut Post website. I did a search for Todds name. Lo and behold, there he was, listed as another unfortunate and preventable suicide in the Lake Mohegan [woods](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TITLE> Maria's Extra-Credit Assignment </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-14 17:52:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was in college, I dated a biologist named Maria. Well, a biology undergraduate. She was a lot of fun, albeit slightly odd. Being a bit odd myself, we hit it off right away. Our first date lasted almost 12 hours - the entirety of which was spent talking as we sipped terrible coffee in a 24-hour diner.


Maria told me she wanted to focus on malacology after undergrad, then started to regale me with passionate stories about the local banana slug. 


I was familiar with the banana slug. Everyone on campus was. They have an unfortunate habit of falling out of trees and landing on the heads of unsuspecting students and faculty. Being around 8 long and remarkably disgusting, having one plop on ones head is pretty close to a living nightmare. My first month on campus, one missed me by inches and splattered on the concrete. I was picking slug out from between my shoelaces for a week.


So, once Maria told me about her slug fascination, I became a little wary. It was a shame, because I liked her quite a bit. She could sense something was awry, so I admitted to being terrified of the things. All bugs, really. Instead of mocking me, which Id grown to expect after years of asking women to kill spiders and centipedes for me, she held my hand. It was the first real physical contact we had together. Right then, I knew she was special.


We dated for a few weeks and our chemistry was phenomenal. It felt good to have such a steady, positive presence in my life.


As the school year progressed, though, it became obvious Maria was struggling with her work. It wasnt that she was slacking or not studying; quite the contrary - she was studying so much that Id only see her once or twice a week. But despite all the work, she was on pace to fail her biology course - the subject most important to her.


After a miserable few days when she was positive shed get thrown out of school for poor grades and never have the opportunity to be the scientist shed wanted to be since she was a little girl, her professor gave her a lifeline: an extra credit assignment. 


The project Maria was given was simple: shed incubate banana slug eggs in different environments to learn how microclimatic variations affect hatch rate and survival beyond one day. She received permission to use several spots on campus: the wellness center, the gym, the chemistry building, the biology building, and, yes, my dorm. So strong were my feelings for Maria that I allowed her to place a shoebox breeding-ground under my bed. 


Yes, I had nightmares about slugs crawling up my bed and laying eggs in my mouth. Who wouldnt?


Unfortunately for Maria, the project didnt go well. She either hadnt prepared the shoeboxes properly or had started with bad samples in the first place, because all but one site yielded dead eggs. The wellness center location produced a few live slugs, but they died within 12 hours. 


Maria was devastated. I did my best to console her, but there wasnt much I could say. We both knew she was going to fail the course. Shed talk to the professor in the morning and see if there was any chance of redoing it. Without much hope, we went to sleep.


Maria got up early and visited the professor in his office. I waited anxiously for her to come back, and about an hour after she left, she texted me with great news. He was letting her try again. He had sympathy for experiments that went wrong.


More shoeboxes, new setups, new spots. Well, almost new. She used the spot under my bed again. I didnt have the energy to complain.


To Marias profound joy, the experiments worked. Within a space of 36 hours, the shoebox hatcheries did exactly what shed hoped. Five out of six were a success!, she exclaimed, and hugged me. Im going to pass the course!


I was so happy for her. It was a huge weight off us both, and in our excitement, one thing led to another. 


Ill spare the graphic details, so heres a summary: she went down on me, I went down on her, and because it was a special occasion, she decided to swing her leg over my head and we got to work doing some mutual fun stuff with our mouths.


Toward the end of the act, she was getting pretty into it. Shed stopped working on me and had straightened up and was grinding against my face while I held on for dear life. As she climaxed, I felt something...different.


Something, no, some things, oozed out onto my lips and tongue. And they were moving. I shrieked and pushed her away and ran my hand across my mouth. Small, wriggling banana slugs clung to my skin. I screamed again and ran into the bathroom. In the mirror, I saw tens of inch-long baby slugs in and around my mouth. I vomited with a violence I never realized could be possible.


Oh my God, Im so sorry!, she cried, as I gagged and tried to scrape the slime off my tongue with my fingernails. I didnt reply, I just looked at her. She stroked my hair in an attempt to comfort me. It wasnt working. She started to say something, then stopped. 


What?, I choked out, still retching.


She was silent for a minute, then said quietly, Its just...well, I guess its six out of six. I thought theyd all [died](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Wed been finding paint chips and broken bits of plaster on the carpet near the cellar door. Id vacuum them up, but each morning theyd be back. At first, I thought it had to be from mice or termites burrowing into the wall. Weve had mice in the basement since we moved in, but theyd never been seen anywhere else in the house. Despite that, I looked for evidence that they couldve made the mess, but I couldnt find any. There wasnt anything out of sort whatsoever, aside from what wed find in the mornings.


Larry didnt think much of it. He mentioned something about a construction site a mile or so away where theyd been blasting out rock. Apparently the shockwaves they produce can form cracks on walls and ceilings. Just cosmetic issues, he assured me. Nothing structural. But neither of us could remember hearing any blasting - especially in the middle of the night.


My guess was whatever had been making our cellar warmer than usual over the last few weeks was to be blamed. Neither Larry nor I could figure out why that was happening, either, but we both assumed there was something with the furnace. The HVAC technician couldnt find anything wrong, but even he admitted it was strange that the basement was a full 30 degrees warmer than the temperature set on the thermostat.


So, with the working belief that the paint and plaster chips were from the expansion and contraction of the doorway, we went on caring about more important things and hoped the heat issue would fix itself.


Last week, I was getting home late after a red-eye flight back from my sisters. Larry was dead asleep when I walked in the house at 4:30am, and I was so sleep deprived I couldnt believe I hadnt killed myself driving home. After I put my stuff down and was getting ready to head upstairs, I saw something that, at the time, I was certain was the result of my exhaustion: the cellar door and the surrounding frame were moving in and out.


I shook my head to get my senses back, but the door and frame still moved in a slow, deliberate pattern. Tiny flecks of plaster fell with each contraction. I walked up to the door and put my hand on it. I still wasnt trusting my eyes and knew that touch would confirm or deny what I was seeing. As I expected, the second I touched the door, the movement stopped. I went upstairs and slept for 10 hours.


Larry was at work when I woke up. He was pulling a double that day, and I likely wouldnt see him again until the next morning. After I showered and went downstairs, I found quite a bit more plaster and paint on the floor than usual. The memory of what I thought Id seen the night before came back, and I experienced an involuntary twinge of fear. It made me feel a bit silly - almost like how Id felt when I was a little girl and still afraid of the dark. 


I brought out the vacuum and started to clean up the mess. When I was running the vacuum over the carpet right next to the cellar, I felt hot air rushing out of the cracks on the sides and bottom of the door. Not warm. Hot. I shut off the vacuum and listened. Aside from the gentle rush of hot air, there was nothing. 


I tentatively touched the doorknob, ready to pull back if it was too hot. It wasnt. It was very warm, but not hot. The fear came again as I knew I was about to open the door and go downstairs. I didnt want to. The child me wouldnt have. But Im 52 years old. This is our house, and weve lived here for 26 years. We know it inside and out. There was nothing to be afraid of. 


The fear remained. I opened the door and was hit in the face with a rush of hot, wet air.


While the temperature wasnt unendurable, it was entirely unpleasant. My plan was to rush downstairs to make sure nothing was on fire, then run back up and call the HVAC man for an emergency visit, no matter the cost. I tiptoed down the old, wooden steps and entered the basement.


The wind rushing up the stairs faded as I got closer to the bottom. All that remained was humid, oppressive air. I began sweating immediately, and I walked across the room toward the furnace. It wasnt even on. I touched it, and while warm, it wasnt close to the temperature of the room. 


Condensation was covering the tiny windows at the top of the walls. And there was an odor. It was heavy and thick and reminded me of vomit. I felt my stomach churning as my mission now became finding the source of the smell. Whatever it was, it had to go. 


It didnt take long.


On the other side of the furnace, up against the wall, was a pile of dead mice. Tens of them. Maybe 50. They were hideously decayed and dripping with dark yellow slime. I gagged so hard I felt my eyes bulge and I pulled my shirt over my nose and mouth. I couldnt believe we hadnt noticed them before, and I was miserable about the prospect of cleaning them up. But it had to be done.


I ran upstairs, grabbed a bucket, some kitchen gloves, and a bottle of bleach. Back in the stifling basement, I grabbed the vermin as quickly as I could, threw them all in the bucket, threw the gloves on top, and poured bleach over the whole area. Id come back later and scrub the remaining slime and bleach and sloughed fur off the floor. I just couldnt take any more at the moment.


I grabbed the bucket and headed back upstairs. I couldve sworn I saw the cellar doorway widening and narrowing as I went, accompanied by waxing and waning gusts of hot air on my skin. My fear and disgust were bordering on terror as I burst through the doorway into the cheery living room.


I stood in the center of the living room, watching the doorway. It wasnt moving. The bucket of dead vermin smelled incomprehensibly putrid. I went out the back door and was ready to throw the whole thing way out back where the property met the woods, when I stopped. There was smoke coming from the gloves on top of the mice. Another smell joined that of the putrefying rodents: burning rubber. I upended the bucket into the brush. I saw that the parts of the gloves that had touched the mice were bubbling and burning away. 


As soon as I got back inside, I called the HVAC guy. He said he was booked solid all day and any work after 6pm would be at double the usual rate. I told him I didnt care. I needed the furnace fixed. I needed whatever it was leaking removed. I couldnt have our home in the shape it was in anymore. 


The HVAC guy arrived around 7. I felt bad to be pulling him away from dinner with his family, so I made him a sandwich and some macaroni and cheese. He appreciated it, and brought the plate downstairs with him so he could eat while he worked. I wasnt exactly sure how anyone could eat under conditions like Id seen that afternoon, but I didnt bother arguing. I left him to his work and went next door to see my elderly neighbor.


We got to talking, and it was almost 10 by the time I realized the HVAC technician was still working. I wished Gladys a good night and went home. The techs van was still in the driveway. 


I walked inside and headed to the cellar door. Plaster and dried paint chips littered the carpet and were being blown across the room by the steady breeze coming up the staircase. Three deep cracks in the door frame and ceiling had appeared.


I called down to the technician and asked how it was going. He didnt reply. I called again, louder. Nothing. That same fear welled up in me again. I looked around. This time, the cheery living room was dark. The windows showed nothing but blackness and the distorted reflection of diffuse kitchen light and the harsh illumination from the techs lamps in the basement.


I called a third time. He didnt respond, but I jumped when a loud, splintering crack rang out right next to me as another fissure appeared in the door frame. I couldve sworn I saw the frame move right before it happened.


My fourth and final call went unanswered. For the second time that day, I knew Id go down the stairs. My 52 year-old body carried my frightened, 8 year-old mind down the steps. I felt hot, sticky air on my face. 


The moment I reached the bottom, the smell hit me. It was just like itd been with the mice, only heavier. I spoke the techs name, rather than calling it. My voice was small and weak and I realized, as I walked toward where hed been working, I was shaking. 


I reached the furnace and headed around to the other side. The smell was so strong, my eyes had started to water. But even through my bleary, tear-filled eyes, I could see the technicians clothes and shoes. They were covered in the same yellow slime and smoked weakly as whatever was burning them ate its way through. The man who owned the clothes was nowhere to be found.


I ran upstairs and called the police, fully aware that the doorway was moving in and out as I ascended the staircase, feeling cool air against my face, followed by hot air against my back. I left the house and waited with Gladys for them to arrive.


Its been five days and the technician has not been recovered. Theres been a town-wide search for him, and his wife and daughters have appeared on television begging for him to come home. Larry and I have allowed the police to search the house while we stay at a hotel. Ive refused to go back until everything is resolved. 


It wasnt the terrifying strangeness of the cellar that has kept me out of our house. It wasnt the still-missing man who came to fix our furnace. It was something else. It was the result of the chemical analysis of the substance on the HVAC mans clothes and the mice Id taken from the basement. Normally, we wouldve have been given that information, but Larrys brother is a cop. He told us what it was, and now I know Ill never set foot in that house again as long as I live.

<TITLE> People are disappearing in northern Canada. </TITLE>

<TEXT> For the last 35 years, a lake in northern Canada has been the site of hundreds of suspected drownings. The location is in the middle of the Canadian tundra. There is nothing around. No food, no shelter. Just cold, inhospitable wilderness. 


The lake is frozen eight months out of the year. Nothing happens then. But during the thaw, when were doing our flyovers, well see clothes floating on the surface of the water. 


Like weve always done, well dispatch a team to investigate. Theyll bring back what they can recover, which will invariably be clothing and someones wallet or purse. 


So far, weve never recovered a single body. 


Had the lake been deep or veined with labyrinthine, subterranean caves, we wouldnt think twice about not being able to recover a body. Same if the lake was full of fish who were big enough to eat and digest a body. But the lakes 40 feet deep at its deepest point. Its crystal clear; we can see the bottom from our helicopter just as clearly as a boater can from its surface.


Our watchpost has turned into an international notification service for missing people. 


The Canadian government granted us the authority, along with the equipment, to research and contact anyone who might be familiar with the owners of the forms of identification. Each time contact is made, we learn the person had been reported missing. 


There doesnt appear to be any time limit on how long a person has to be missing before their clothing and IDs are found floating. Some can be missing for days, others for years. Any personal effects wed recovered then get sent back to the families or loved ones.


While the situation is bizarre, Ive never lost much sleep over it. It's all too surreal; without any bodies or signs of violence, its easy to brush the darkest aspects of it aside. But this past spring, after the thaw and during the new recoveries, different reports started coming in.


Indigenous people within a 300 mile range have started showing up in hospitals. Unexplained burns have been found on their skin. Further, the cancer rate among the indigenous population has risen by 400%. 


I havent been alone in noticing the new, blueish lights seen reflecting off low-hanging clouds. I had a hunch one night, and had our helicopter pilot fly us in the direction of the lake. Like Id expected, the flashes of blue against the clouds intensified as we got closer.


Upon our arrival at the site, hovering approximately 100 feet above the lake, blue light would shine at irregular intervals from the bottom. The pilot, a former American military engineer, said it looked like Cherenkov radiation. 


That alone wouldnt be enough for me to write this. Unexplained natural phenomena is a fact of life. It seems like the more remote you are, the more inexplicable things youll encounter. The floating clothes concern me, but dont frighten me. The flashing light fascinates me, but doesnt disturb me. But theres one last thing. 


A geological expedition recently finished a topographical study of the surrounding area for an unrelated purpose. Their data, like all state research, was made available to us. Being moderately interested in geology and geological formations, I gave it a look. Something caught my eye.


I went to our database of the photographs wed taken of the personal effects wed recovered from the lake. I was looking for ID photos. Before long, I found what I was looking for. I checked it against the geological data Id seen. Not really believing what I was looking at, I checked again with another ID photo. Same thing.


For 500 miles around the lake where people disappear, the topographical readouts show the vague, but unmistakable shapes of the faces of the missing people. And the faces are clearly [screaming](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TITLE> The Sleeping Game </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-10 20:01:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My brother and cousins and I used to play a game whenever we had a sleepover. It was simple: wed stay up and scare the living fuck out of each other. When we were at Erin and Kyles house, it was the scariest by far. Her house was haunted. Thats what everyone said. Even her parents knew it. Dont worry about Mr. Toombs, theyd say. Hes harmless. Then theyd laugh and go back to what they were doing.

Mr. Toombs was the man who owned the house before Erins parents. He died all alone and no one realized he was gone until many months later. Even though the house got gutted and renovated before it went on the market, we had this feeling hed died in the basement right near the furnace. The air there just felt thick and heavy  like old, sour breath.

Wed have our sleepovers a few times a month. Our parents all worked at the same factory. Whenever they had to take third shift, wed either stay at home and Erin and Kyle would come to our house or Greg and I would go over to Erin and Kyles. I never minded all the moving around until Kyle said we had to play that game. I hated it.

Kyle was the oldest and could be mean if he wanted to. He wasnt a bully; he usually knew when to back off and genuinely felt bad if he made one of us cry. But he still liked to get his way. And that meant wed have to play the sleeping game.

The first time we played the sleeping game, we were at our house. The four of us were in our sleeping bags in the living room and Kyle started to tell a really terrifying story about a skinny alien that comes through the window and cuts you up in your bed. Greg, Erin, and I hated the story, but I could tell Erin was especially horrified. She was only six. I kept telling Kyle to take it easy on his sister, but he was relentless. To Erins credit, she didnt cry, but I think that was the problem. He probably wouldve stopped if she had.

The game went like this: after the story, you werent allowed to get out of your sleeping bag. No matter how scared you were, you couldnt get up to get water, you couldnt go to the bathroom, and under no circumstances could you run upstairs to get comfort from the grownups. If you did, youd have to get an indian burn from the rest of the group.

The night of the alien story, I couldnt stop looking at the living room windows. Whenever a car went by and cast its light against the wall, Id shiver and feel my balls drawing up into my body while goosebumps rose on the back of my neck. Stupid Greg and Kyle were asleep already. Erin, whose sleeping bag was next to mine, was crying to herself.

I need to pee, she whispered. And Im too scared to get up and I dont want to get an indian burn when I get back.

I looked at Greg and Kyle. They were both completely out. Go ahead, I whispered. I wont tell anyone.

Erin gave me a tight-lipped smile and snuck out of her sleeping back and padded down the hallway. Right around when Id assumed I would hear the bathroom door close, she screamed. It was a shrill, horror-filled explosion from her tiny lungs, and the three of us, now wide awake, vaulted from our sleeping bags in her direction. We got there a couple seconds before my parents were thundering down the steps. They flipped on the lights.

Erin was in the corner of the bathroom, sobbing. Her pajama pants were soaked. Mom picked her up and held her to her chest and asked what happened.

The alien, Erin whimpered, then pointed to the shower curtain. Dad opened it. Nothing was there.

It was just a shadow, honey, Dad told her. He glared at us. Come with me, boys, he ordered, and brought us back into the living room while Mom drew a bath for Erin.

After a long lecture from my father, we agreed to not tell any more scary stories. Erin eventually came back to her sleeping bag, and with Dad snoring on the couch, we all went to sleep.

The next night, of course, brought more stories. They were much tamer, though. Greg told a dumb one about a lady who gets pulled into a grave by a killer. I told an even worse one about some teenager whose baby brothers head came off. Erin actually laughed at that one it was so bad. We got ready to go to sleep, still bound by the agreement that we couldnt get up for any reason until it was morning.

At some point in the middle of the night, Greg shook me awake. Hey, we caught Erin coming back from the bathroom. She was already rubbing her arm in discomfort from the burn her brother had given her. Greg grabbed her other one and twisted, making Erin yelp. I took her arm and just squeezed it a little. I felt bad.

Months went by and we played the sleeping game every time we were together. Everyone got caught at least once trying to sneak out. Indian burns were had by all. Erin, though, got the most. It was obvious she wasnt having any fun. To make matters worse, she looked exhausted on the mornings after we played. I brought it up to Kyle, and he thought about it for a minute, then said wed do it once a month instead of every time. I didnt argue.

We kept our little agreement to ourselves because we didnt want Erin to think we were treating her like a baby. That night, we were sleeping at their house. They had a beautifully furnished basement with a big-screen TV, a ping-pong table, and all sorts of other fun stuff. We set up our sleeping bags and played video games until well after 10pm. My aunt came down and said to turn it all off and get to sleep, so we made like we were getting ready for bed, but when the lights went off, Kyle said it was time to play the sleeping game.

I groaned, but he shot me a look and mouthed only one, to me. At least he was holding up his end of the bargain. Like we always did, anyone who needed to get up to pee or get a drink beforehand was allowed to. I went, followed by Kyle, then Erin. We all came back.

In the glow of the flashlight Kyle liked to hold under his chin when he told his stories, Kyle started to talk about a ghost. *The* ghost. Mr. Toombs. Even Greg looked uncomfortable as he stared at the slatted wooden door which served as the barrier between the furnished and unfurnished cellar. The furnace was on the other side.

Mr. Toombs waits until youre asleep, Kyle whispered, and sucks your breath into his lungs. The longer you sleep, the more he takes away. And if you sleep for too long, you wont have any air left to breathe and youllbedead.

My eyes were wide with fear and Greg just stared at the ground. Kyle, too, looked like hed successfully startled himself, especially when the furnace kicked on and we all jumped. Erin, surprisingly, had actually managed to go to sleep first, despite bawling her eyes out by the end of the story and making Kyle promise to give her his snack at lunch or else shed tell on him. I snuck her one of the Lifesaver candies Id stashed away to help her feel better. I guess itd worked.

The rest of us tried to go to sleep. Kyle caught me getting up to pee and gave me a wicked indian burn, but since he caught me while he was on his way to the bathroom himself, I was able to reciprocate. Hard. He punched me in the arm and I swatted him in the balls. I won. We tiptoed back into the basement and got in our sleeping bags. It was the worst nights sleep Id ever had; each time the furnace kicked on, I knew Id see Mr. Toombs floating above my sleeping bag ready to suck the life out of me.

Like always, my aunt came downstairs in the morning to wake us up for school. She started with gentle calls, then hollers, then shouts, then, since we always ignored her, she stomped down the stairs and threatened to haul us out of the sleeping bags.

Lets go!, she ordered, get dressed and go get your breakfast. Erin, if I have to ask you again Im gonna flush your goldfish.

Erin didnt budge.

I swear to God, Erin, Goldeens going down into the sewer with the Ninja Turtles in 321

Nothing. Concern flashed across my aunts face. Kyle, whod been sleeping next to her, shook his sister. She didnt respond. My aunt rushed across the room and pulled Erin to her. She hung limply out of the sleeping bag.

Everything went really fast for a while. The ambulance came while my aunt and uncle screamed and cried and Kyle, Greg, and I just sat there in stunned silence. My parents arrived soon after. They were also crying. We were all asked if we saw her drink any alcohol or take any medicine. None of us had. I knew Erin had been the last one to use the bathroom before bed, so I mentioned that. Someone went into the bathroom and returned with an empty bottle of sleeping pills thatd been in the medicine cabinet.

Through her tears, my aunt insisted that the bottle had been empty to begin with; that shed been saving it so she could remember which kind had worked for her so she could get it again. But there was no other explanation at the time. Erin was dead.

There was a funeral. It was terribly sad. But I went on with my life. Everyone did. I learned years later that the toxicology reports had been negative and Erins death had been ruled an accidental asphyxiation. They blamed the sleeping bag, and my aunt and uncle sued for millions.

When Greg was moving out before his first year at college, I was asked to help load the van. I didnt want to, but I helped anyway. Some of the heavier things were boxed up in the unfinished part of the cellar, by the furnace. I went down and tried not to think about poor Erin.

When I opened the door and entered the warm furnace room, I remembered that feeling I got the first time Id been in there. An image of Mr. Toombs decaying next to the furnace flashed through my head. I shivered. But then I noticed the familiar, strange heaviness in the air. I noticed the smell. It was different from the sour odor thatd reminded me of the last breath trapped inside a corpses rotting lungs. This smell was sweet. It was cloying. Like the breath of someone whod eaten a lime [Lifesaver](http://unsettlingstories.com). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol my brother is so gross I hate him. [I wrote about my sister a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4ho869/um_can_any_of_you_guys_tell_me_whats_wrong_with/?st=ivbamqdh sh=d65e3411) and you guys were total a-word holes about it but its okay shes dead. I got in SO much trouble btw but they were too sad to hit me which is fine because I wouldve called CPS on their butts haha.


But yeah I was watching my baby brother Tommy while my parents were out of state at some election party or something and Tommy just started throwing up. Btw if any of you guys are like why is she watching her baby brother after her sister died while she was watching her you can just keep that in yourselves. My parents are weird. I think theyre swingers lol Danica taught me what that meant.


So, like, it wasnt the normal boob milk puke or anything either it was all red and stringy and ugh. Of course I started thinking about dumb dead Gina and being like how much more awful can my luck get and stuff. Gross Tommy just kept spitting up until his high chair was covered in puke. 


It. Smelled. So. Bad. O. M. G.


Anyway I started yelling at him and slapping him so hed stop but then his eye fell out and I got SO MAD because of COURSE Id get blamed for it. Then because he hates me he started to laugh and aimed his pukey mouth at me and I got some in my hair.


Of course since I have the best hair in the family I was so grossed out I ran upstairs and took a shower and left my gross brother to finish throwing up and playing with his dumb eye. I snuck into Moms cabinet and used her real expensive lotion after because it smelled real good and Tommys throw up was making the house smell bad.


While I was making sure my elbows were all nice and moist and sexy (lol) Tommy started yelling. And it wasnt his normal yell either. It was all deep and loud and vibratey like he was showing off and pretending to be a monster. Such a little creep I hate him.


You ever feel it in your stomach and butt when a real low vibration comes by and its like you gotta go to the bathroom? Well yeah it was like that. So totally nasty and inappropriate. Even though he wasnt saying anything it was like he was being so crude and just bad mannered. He reminded me SO much of Gina ugh talk about a boring funeral lol.


Like, we dont have too many people in the family and what was left of Gina was so gross that people took it away to study or something haha. I always used to make fun of her and call her a science experiment and I bet thats what she is now. Itd be funny if it still hurt for her even though shes all dead and stuff. Mom doesnt say anything about god anymore except bad words when she doesnt think Im around but I know she does and Ill tell Dad on her if shes mean about Tommys grossness.


Ugh why am I talking about Gina its making me mad. Its so not my fault but its sooooooo nice not to have to share a room anymore. Like Im in heaven lol.


I wanted to keep putting on the nice lotion but RIGHT ON CUE Tommy apparently fell out of his high chair and managed to get up the stairs because there he was, all walking on his hands backwards or something weird and drooling that stringy puke EVERYWHERE and when he got real close to Dads bearskin rug I kicked him away because no way should that get puke on it omg Id get in so much trouble.


The problem is as soon as I kicked Tommy his head sorta kinda fell off BUT NOT TOTALLY OFF SERIOUSLY its still hanging by a little bit of skin. He wont stop laughing and its super obnoxious and now places where his puke didnt even touch are starting to drip with it. Its like Tommy knew exactly how to get me in trouble and now hes doing it like just right there now he bit the cat like totally in half.


Anyways yeah you guys were total deutsche bags (lol thank Danica for that one too) but I need your help if you can control yourselves and not be mean in the comments. How can I get puke out of a carpet and get a new cat that looks like Ms. Flufferbottom and a new baby that looks like Tommy because I seriously think this ones broken. Like, how does a baby even grow extra legs? So annoying. But yeah help a pretty girl out [lol](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> It's a good way to screw with the reader. If you're writing something that's oppressively horrifying and miserable and dark, the reader can get desensitized to it all. Throwing in some humor might get them to relax, which will allow any coming atrocities to seem that much more jarring.

<TEXT> I guess I'll give a real response to this, since it's obvious I'm part of the reason why it was created.


First off: I'd be fine with the proposal, even though I don't think there's a way to actually do it. Like /u/EtTuTortilla said, maybe some CSS magic could hide usernames, but good luck finding someone who wants to code that.


I am 100% certain my username affects the number of votes my stories get. If people see something they consistently like or dislike, they'll upvote or downvote it without necessarily even looking at what's been posted. On NoSleep, for me at least, that translates to pretty much any story I post getting approximately 20 upvotes in the first hour.


That number is an average based only on what I've observed, so if there's some actual statistics out there, I'm sure they can tell a more accurate story. But yeah, that's what I've noticed. Better stories have gotten more, worse ones have gotten less.


What that average of 20/hour does for me is place one of my stories in the top 5 essentially by default. It's dependent on traffic, but since I usually post between 10am and 1pm EST, there's not much of that. Plus, at that time, theres little new content. A lot of the older content that's been at or near the top has reached whatever threshold Reddit's created where the number of votes it's still receiving means less than the amount of time the post has been up. So, basically, it means those posts are ready to be replaced with fresh material.


Again, depending on how busy the sub is at that time and whether any other popular "name-brand" authors like /u/ezmisery or /u/sleepyhollow_101 have posted around the same time, one of mine usually breaks into the top 2 or 3 about an hour after that. Hitting number 1, though, from what I can determine, is almost entirely based on whether or not people like the story. Theres a LOT of eyes on a number 1 story; that position means its usually on the front page when someone whos subscribed to NoSleep opens Reddit. 


If you look at your own front page, depending on how many subreddits youre subscribed to, the number of posts between the number 1 story on NoSleep and the number 2 story is 75-100. Its a LOT. To go from 2nd to 1st in any situation except when the #1 story is almost a day old requires a lot of upward pressure. More than my name alone has been able to generate, I think. Its all about how people feel about the story at that point.


THAT SAID, since my name already brought me into the top 5, it still has a higher likelihood of being read and voted on than the story of someone else who didn't get into the top 5 within the first couple hours.


Whether or not thats unfair is a gray area. A year ago, when I was still new to NoSleep, I didnt have name recognition. Any story I wrote that got to the top spots were based on the fact people enjoyed what they read and upvoted it. Even today, with the advantage I admit to having, I routinely get my stories thrown off the top by either new writers, or writers who are using an alternate account. All that shows me is despite my following, a better-liked story will usually come out on top. Its how it worked for me a year ago, and its how its working for other writers right now.

<TITLE> The Oblivion that Masks Pain </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He said Id feel better after a while; that my pain would fade along with his memory. His words echoed throughout the husk hed left. My soul had been cored out and left to rot. 


I tossed and turned, night after night, as I imagined him with the one who made him happy. My replacement. The thought of their sex didnt bother me. It was the intimacy after - the quiet bliss when I was the furthest thing from his mind. Just days following the dissolution of our multi-year couplehood, the one which whom hed spent so much of his life was on her way to being forgotten. 


I was forgotten.


I sought an oblivion to mask my pain; anything to dull the omnipresent savagery of loss. Memories of our happiness felt false. I wondered how long he hated me before he finally let me know it was over. How long was I happy while he was miserable? How much of his life had I stolen, oblivious to his diminishing love? I knew it was all in my mind. And my mind screamed as cascades of neurotransmitters reinforced my feelings of profound, hideous dejection. 


Then I had an idea. 


Part of me felt sad about how easy it was to buy heroin.


The first pet store I visited had the rats I wanted. I brought them home and fed them a solution of sugar water and heroin. They died soon after. I knew the last moment of their lives had been their best. 


While they were still warm, I removed their brains and ate them. I wanted to absorb the physical manifestation of their joy.


I know a small portion of the euphoria I experienced following my meal was from the trace amounts of heroin Id ingested. But it lasted longer than a drug high. It lasted for days. For three full days, the thought of him didnt send me into a self-destructive spiral. Quite the contrary; I felt like I was growing. I was getting over him.


At the end of the three days, the pain came back. Nightmares flooded the sleep thatd once been a respite. The fact remained: I was gradually being forgotten. I was being replaced. Someone was creating new memories with the person I love. I couldnt let that happen.


More rats, more heroin. Another respite. Two days, though. Only two. It wasnt working the way Id hoped. The root of the problem was still there. Every passing day, I was becoming less clear in his mind. The prospect being forgotten was infinitely worse than forgetting him. The former made the latter impossible.


My moment of serendipity occurred while I was throwing the dead rats down the garbage chute. 


He answered his phone when I called. To this day, I feel terrible for lying to him. He rushed over, as strong and protective as ever, to see whod hurt me. When he was sitting down, I came behind him and injected a lethal dose of heroin into the side of his neck. He punched me, hard, before his pupils contracted. Before he stopped breathing, he smiled at me.


Kate, he whispered, to think Id almost forgotten how beautiful you are. He exhaled a long, quiet breath. His eyes never left mine as he blinked once or twice, almost as if he were wondering why he didnt feel the need to inhale anymore. When he died, his smile remained.


I opened his head. It took longer than Id expected. I made sure to keep cleaning off his face. His smile urged me to go on. After an hour, I stared at the mass inside his skull that was him. His essence. His everything.


I didnt know what part did what. I just knew it was all him, so it was all important. Over the course of a few days, I consumed him as he smiled. Each morsel had the potential to be a piece that contained his memory of me. All his memories of the good times. All his memories of the beauty we experienced. The closeness. 


When his skull was empty, I felt different. I wasnt euphoric, like Id felt after the rats. I felt better. I was at peace. This was my closure. Id ensured that I wouldnt be forgotten. The one I loved was with me again. Forever. And together, we could be free to make new [memories](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> My girlfriend and I were crossing through a graveyard when she abruptly stopped and grabbed my arm. She grinned. I knew that grin.


Here? In a cemetery?, I asked. It felt a little weird. Disrespectful, too.


Mmhmm, she mewled, and pulled off her shirt.


I looked around. It was obvious we were alone. Even though itd stopped raining an hour earlier, it was still misty and cool. New England autumn was in full effect. The ground was covered in dead leaves. The place looked creepy.


Were gonna get soaked, I complained, but I started taking off my pants.


I already am, she whispered. I thought about making a joke and telling her that she shouldve brought an umbrella, but I figured it wasnt the time or place.


We did what we apparently needed to do. She seemed to enjoy it, at least. Afterward, I was trying to pick leaves and grass off and out of myself while she grabbed our clothes off the headstone.


Recognize the name?, she asked.


Whose name?


She pointed. My eyes widened.


Rudolph Jans Mendelson is fucking buried here?!, I exclaimed. She grinned.


I wish I couldve met him, she complained.


Um, you know he wouldve killed you, right? Like the others?


No, I dont think so. We wouldve gotten along just fine. Again, she grinned. I probably couldve given him a reason or two to keep me alive. She grabbed my crotch, as if I didnt get what she was talking about.


The late afternoon dimness was giving way to full dark. Fog joined the mist and it crept down the hill into the cemetery like a shroud. My girlfriend looked enthralled.


Im getting chilly, I told her. Its probably time we head back.


Hang on a minute, let me just take this all in. She pulled her phone out of her pocket and started snapping pictures of the headstone. I want everyone to see where we were.


She got a couple shots, then gave me the phone to hold. Thick, cold raindrops began to fall. Yeah, thats probably our cue to leave, I insisted, and started to walk away.


While I was pulling my sweatshirt over my head, I heard her gasp, then moan. Whats wro--, I started to say, but then felt the blood drain from my head as I saw what was causing her to make those sounds.


A hand - a cracked, skeletal hand - had burst from the ground and was gripping her ankle. I shouted and grabbed her arm, but she pulled away. Blood wept through her denim as the hand gripped ever tighter, and after a second, I heard the bone crack.


She didnt cry out, though. Her face took on an expression of intense discomfort, but she refused to shout. I didnt refuse. I yelled and kicked at the hand as profound horror forced adrenaline through my body.


Again, I tried to grab her arms. She struggled, but I held tight. I pulled as hard as I could. As I did, a hideous rotting corpse was dragged from its grave. Rudolph Jans Mendelson.


Let me go!, she finally screamed. Let me go!


I was sobbing now and expending all the effort I could to pull her away from the corpse. His misshapen head seethed with maggots and his eyes and tongue bulged out like some benthic atrocities that had never been exposed to light.


Miiiiiiiiiine, he groaned, and his other hand reached up and grabbed her back; his nails sinking into the flesh and using it to pull. Miiiiiine!


Let me go, let me go, let me go!, she continued to scream. My eyes were closed now as I pulled with singular purpose. I felt teeth sinking into my arm and my eyes flew open as I shouted with pain. 


In that moment of agony and surprise, my grip loosened. My girlfriend fell back into Mendelsons grip and he squeezed her against his rotting, pulpy body. His swollen tongue passed over her neck and face. She wasnt struggling anymore. She just watched me and watched my reaction. Mendelson squeezed harder and I heard his ribs splinter as my girlfriends body was pulled inside.


Thank you for helping me be with him, she said to me, as she was drawn deeper into his putrid carcass. I always knew wed be perfect [together](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TITLE> Fireflies </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-03 15:45:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The theory went like this: when confused by nighttime fog, fireflies can congregate into masses of hundreds, or sometimes even thousands. The fog reduces their ability to signal properly; the distance is shortened and the light becomes too diffuse. To survive and attract mates, individual fireflies started banding together. Once a small group is formed, they signal to one another with pheromones, and that triggers simultaneous illumination. Its brighter, so even through the fog, solitary fireflies can find the group. So if you see a glowing beachball hovering over the lake on a foggy night, dont freak out. Its just fireflies trying to fuck.


I moved to the woodsy town in Vermont a couple years ago. During my first summer there, when the pea-soup fog rolled off the lake every evening, I saw those glowing orbs for the first time. That was before Id learned they were fireflies, so I didnt know what I was seeing. I watched from my porch as the ball floated across the yard at the edge of the forest. It was beautiful, but haunting.


The following morning, at the local diner, I brought up what Id seen. The waitress laughed and said they were just the local fireflies. Apparently theyre considered a minor celebrity in the area. My buddy from college, Phil, was an entomologist. Bugs were his thing. So when I got home after breakfast, I called him up. I figured hed be interested in the phenomenon.


Apparently, interested was an understatement. I guess fireflies had never been observed doing something like that anywhere else in the world. I told him hed be welcome if he wanted to make the drive up from Connecticut and stay for a few days to see them for himself. He did.


The next day, Phil arrived at dusk. Great timing. I gave him a quick tour of the place, then we brought a six pack out to the porch and waited for the fog to move in.


In a steady, slow creep, the fog poured across the lake, into the forest, and swallowed my yard. The moonlight was a dull haze above our heads, and right away we saw individual fireflies trying to locate one another with their bioluminescent shouts.


We waited and drank beer after beer as we caught up on the goings on in our respective lives over the last ten years. After a couple hours, I caught a glimpse of something glowing on the other side of the trees, right by the lake. I pointed and Phil stood up and went to the edge of the porch.


Wow, he breathed, and I could sense his genuine excitement. It was contagious. I got up and stood with him as we gazed at the orb of softly undulating light, our beers forgotten.


The mass of fireflies approached the edge of the yard, every one of its members flying in a tight, spherical pattern. I dont believe my eyes, Phil said. That behaviors never been documented in that species.


The spheres light waxed and waned, and solitary fireflies all over the yard, disoriented in the morass of fog, began to move toward the group. They incorporated themselves into the luminous mass.


The group turned back toward the forest and eventually went out of sight. 


Pretty cool, right?, I asked.


One of the coolest things Ive seen in my career, he agreed. Im going to write up a report tomorrow morning, then tomorrow night Im going to see if I can record it with my phone. Might not come out too great in the low light, though.


Worth a shot, I said. He nodded.


The next morning, I made coffee while Phil typed up his report. I could tell he was impatiently waiting for the evening, so I made a list of local stuff we could do to help the time pass more quickly for him. He finished up and we went out and had a fun, eventful day.


The sun drowned itself in the lake while we ate dinner. Individual fireflies right outside the window were already signalling, as if they wanted to do as much talking as possible before the fog made their job harder. I told Phil to go outside and leave the dishes to me. He didnt argue.


I watched from the kitchen window as Phil dragged a lawn chair out to the line where the yard met the forest. He sat with his phone and his tablet and waited while fog drifted in around him. 


He didnt need to wait long.


An orb of fireflies coalesced no more than 20 feet from my friend. I stopped washing up and stepped out onto the porch to watch Phil get his footage. He held his phone out like he was Spielberg filming his next award-winning movie. 


I dont know if this is gonna work, he called to me. Too damn dark. He put the phone on the chair and tried to record with the camera in his tablet. Thats a little better, he said. I think the camera in this thing is better in low light.


He recorded for a minute, then I saw two more orbs coming in off the lake. Perfect. The waitress told me the smaller masses would sometimes join bigger ones, so I hoped that was the case. Phil noticed them too and called out, thats so cool!


The new masses of fireflies converged on the one in the yard. The fog was dense and I was having trouble seeing Phil, but the glow of the bugs had produced a peaceful, pale-yellow haze.


I heard Phil swearing to himself. The filming wasnt going very well.


How about a picture?, I asked. That might help with the light problem. Try to take a lot of shots in a row and maybe you can animate them in the computer afterward.


Phil didnt say anything, but I saw him move the tablet down as if he were changing some settings. He held it back up, and flashes exploded through the fog as he took picture after picture.


This is gonna screw up the way their illumination looks, he shouted, but at least I can show how theyre clustered together.


Flash after flash after flash bloomed through the thick fog. Above us, the sky lit up as distant lightning announced a coming storm. Indeed, a storm had been forecasted for the early morning hours, but apparently it was ahead of schedule. You see that?


Yeah, Phil replied. Ill get inside before the rain.


He kept snapping pictures. On the outskirts of the yard, I noticed more light. There were new orbs. Lots of them, ranging from ones the size of a lemon to others the size of watermelon. Phil!, I shouted, check those out!


More orbs coalesced and moved in the direction of Phil, apparently attracted by the strobing camera. The lightning flashed again. Brighter this time. Closer. There was no accompanying thunder. 


Now there were tens of the firefly clusters, and the yard was a blur of pale yellow that threatened to compete with the camera flashes. This is fucking awesome!, Phil hollered, and almost as if in response, more lightning lit up the fog. It was almost blinding now, and I said to Phil we should probably go in. Hang on, he replied. Im almost done.


All the firefly masses formed one colossal ball the size of mid-sized car, which hovered directly above Phil. There was another burst of lightning, this time accompanied by a gust of wind so powerful it knocked me down. The mass of fireflies scattered. And Phil screamed.


I jumped back to my feet just in time to be nearly blinded by an explosion of intense light coming from where my buddy was standing. I squinted and tried to acclimate my vision. Phil kept hollering. Whats going on?!, I shouted to him. There was no reply other than hysterical gibberish. 


My eyes slowly acclimated to the light and I when I realized why Phil was screaming, I gasped and backed up to the house. A glowing firefly the size of a school bus was pinning him to the ground. He struggled and thrashed, but the insect must have weighed tons. Its wings fluttered and a hurricane-force wind pushed me against the house and flung leaves and branches from the nearby trees.


Help!, Phil shouted, over and over. I was too terrified to move. I could only watch as the hideously luminescent creature held my friend under its bulk.


A small drop of pure, white light fell from the mandible of the monstrous bug. Phils scream grew high pitched and inhuman. More of the liquid light drooled from the fireflys mouth. I smelled burning. Burning clothes. Burning grass. Burning meat. A pool of radiance formed where Phil was pinned. His screaming stopped.


The firefly lurched up and took to the air, the wind from its wings shattering windows in the house and tossing me to the ground. It was gone. The light was gone. The orbs were gone. All that remained was a puddle of horrible luminescence. 


I ran in the house and dialed 911, spoke to them for a minute, then stepped warily toward the liquid light. The stench was overwhelming. I gagged and got closer. The fog was making it difficult to see anything with proper resolution. But soon, I was only a couple feet away. It all came into focus. 


The acidic light, which was now starting to dim, had destroyed everything it had touched. Tattered, singed clothing still smoked. The skeletal remains of my friend still steamed. And gripped in his bony hand, the melting tablet still sat, its flash strobing with dying pulses as the acid ate it [away](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<TEXT> I was ten when it happened. My tenth birthday. I was in the woods with my uncle and father and they were making sure I knew how to shoot. Before I could hunt deer, I had to show them I could hunt bottles. By that, I mean I had to hit ten bottles from ten feet away, using ten bullets. It wasnt much a test. I couldve done that when I was seven. My guess was they just wanted to do something special with the number ten. I wouldve preferred ten cakes.


Thanks to my well-placed shots, the first three bottles exploded in glittering, green shards. Against the sullen backdrop of the sun-punctured gray sky and the forest still recovering from last years fire, it looked hauntingly pretty. 


Even though Id worn my ear protection, I felt discomfort in both my ears. It wasnt the normal ringing Id encountered before, though. It was a painful buzzing, like flies were trapped by my eardrums.


I looked over and saw my dad and uncle both rubbing the area around their ears. Theyd taken out their plugs and looked uncomfortable and confused. I pulled off my own and asked what was going on. Dad shook his head and said he didnt know.


Mother of fuck!, my uncle exclaimed, prompting a burst of giggles from me and a slap upside his head from my dad. But then we saw what had caused his outburst. 


The seven remaining bottles were floating. They stood, motionless, three feet above the rocks where theyd been placed. The buzzing intensified and the three of us cringed. It was like a colony of bees had descended on the quiet forest.


Lets go, Dad said, grabbing my hand, and we started walking back the way we came. 


Then the world ended.


My father and uncle were hoisted into the air. I shrieked. Their eyes grew wide with fright and they held their rifles in deathgrips while pointing them in every direction in a futile attempt to threaten whatever was assailing them. I remember how my dad looked right before it happened. The instant before.


A one of the levitating bottles flew with impossible speed. It struck my dad in his open mouth and shattered. Glass stuck inside his devastated gums, tongue, and cheeks. My uncle, now screaming, was met with the same hideous assault. Both wailed around the glass impaling the soft tissue of their mouths while I tugged at my dads leg, trying to pull him back to Earth.


30 years later, their screams haunt me more than the sight of their blood. But blood poured. Blood gushed. In a haze of uncomprehending horror, I watched as the shards extracted themselves from the mouths of the men and began to carve. Lips were amputated. Cheeks were excised. Flesh dropped to the forest floor. The buzzing in my ears reached an unbearable level, and with a sharp cracking sound, everything went silent.


Deaf, I huddled against a large tree and sobbed. I couldnt tear my eyes away from the violence. In a noiseless, surreal nightmare, I saw the glass carve their gums down to the roots of their teeth. Their heads jerked forward in a powerful movement and teeth exploded out of their skulls and into the sky. I followed their trajectory and saw, for the first time, a patch of dull, green light behind the gathering clouds.


I looked back at my father and uncle. Theyd stopped moving their arms and legs and trunks. The violent forward motion had to have broken their necks. My uncles eyes gaped and darted in every direction, but Dads were on me. They expressed pain, but something else, too. It was comfort. Even in the bloodbath, he wanted me to know it would be okay.


It wasnt okay.


The green light intensified and I saw the outline of something - thats still the only word I can use - something - in the sky. The first thing that came to mind was Medusas head. It had a spherical center and countless, serpentine spires jutting from it at every conceivable angle. Liquid patches of light traveled between the spires, and as it descended, I felt the buzz which had deafened me vibrating my hair and fat.


It reached the treeline. It was the size of a house. My dad and uncle had their eyes on it as their ruined mouths wept. The spires stopped mere feet away from the three of us. A sliver of green shone on the two men, and they began to shake wildly.


If they hadnt been paralyzed from the tooth extraction, the shaking wouldve ensured it. They flopped like electrocuted ragdolls pinned to a corkboard; arms, legs, hips, backs - all contorting in ways that would splinter and pulverize their bones. My fathers knees bent forward, hyperextending until his toes were touching his hips. My uncles lower jaw swept back and forth. There was no conceivable way they were still alive.


With a sense of resignation, I realized I couldnt move. I was pinned in my position, helpless to do anything but stare at the carnage. I assumed I would be next.


The green light flashed red. The tattered clothing on my relatives split and fell. The glass, which had dropped to the ground after finishing with their mouths, took to the air again. It sliced through their bodies in long, deep incisions. The red light intensified, and I watched as their splintered, fragmented bones were hurled from their bodies toward the liquid light on the spire-studded object. In a final, hideous act, their eyes dropped from their boneless sockets and pulped brain matter followed them.


Two motionless bags of flesh hung in the silent forest.


If I passed out at that point, it wasnt for long.


My eyes opened to the sight of the husks of my uncle and father being prodded by one spire each. Skin flopped back and forth. Any remaining blood rained onto the floor of the abattoir nouveau below them. The light had shifted from red to something else Id never seen before. It was as if they were trapped in a beam of shadow; it wasnt perfectly black, but dark gray.


Black fluid began to drip out of their skin. It puddled in the mess of blood and organs on the ground. Their flesh wounds began to close. The dripping slowed, then stopped. The bodies started to regain their original shape.


My despondent resignation grew teeth as fresh fear suffused my small body. The skins were full again. The arms and legs moved, as if they were being tested. Eyes sprouted from the empty sockets and teeth filled their mouths. After a couple minutes, they looked exactly like they had before theyd been murdered. 


Exactly.


Everything blurred after this.


I remember them slowly descending to the ground. I remember their mouths moving as if they were talking to me, but in my deafness, I heard nothing. I remember trying to run, but being stopped; stopped and held against the chest of the thing who looked like my father. The twinkle of concern in his eyes was gone.


I was carried through the forest to our house. I remember Mom starting at the sight of my nude father and uncle entering, but then I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was in my bed. It was the day after my birthday.


As I said above, its been 30 years. I am still deaf. Everything continued as if nothing had happened, other than a freak accident due to a combination of a misfiring shell and my shrugging off of my hearing protection right beforehand. I even told Mom about it all, and she just stroked my hair and told me it mustve been a terrible nightmare. 


There was no warmth in her eyes.


My mother, my father, and my uncle still live on the same street. I live across town. I dont see them very often. They express great sadness at this and message frequently, but I cant forget what I know happened - what I know wasnt a dream. 


Over the years, there have been clues. Every so often thered be a newspaper article about strange lights in the sky or messes of blood and organs found in the forest. Theyre things that are always explained away by auroras or animal attacks. Weird stuff, but not anything thatll make people think more than twice.


Five years ago, I was on my way to the supermarket on my bicycle when my chain fell off. I pulled over onto the sidewalk to fix it. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw another cyclist crossing the street. Then a car made an illegal turn and the cyclist had to swerve out of the way. He fell onto the ground. I looked up and realized it was Dad. He was picking himself up. A small gash had appeared on his elbow. Greasy, black liquid trickled down his arm.


He saw me and smiled. Then he looked at his arm and sighed. He lifted the bike back onto its wheels, walked up to me, and signed, your mother and I miss you. He hopped on the bike and rode away.


I just stared at tiny black drops on the [pavement](http://unsettlingstories.com).

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was getting my hand stitched up in the ER last night when a series of rapid beeps sounded on the intercom, followed by an announcement of ABD, code A, bay 1. Every doctor and nurse in the area stopped what they were doing and rushed to the main ER entrance. They got there just in time to meet the ambulances.


I couldnt see anything, so I waited. I figured there had to have been a serious accident. My phone rang. It was my Lucy, my wife. She asked how my hand was. I told her they were still stitching it up. I apologized for getting blood all over her bagel, and she laughed and said she told me not to cut it that way. 


There was a pause while Lucy answered one of the kids questions in the background. Then she came back on the line and asked if I saw that really bright light about a half hour ago. I didnt know what she was talking about, so she went on.


It was crazy bright - the whole sky was this weird, pastel pink color. Then it turned white. It almost hurt to look at it was so bright.


Huh, I replied. Maybe it was a UFO. I craned my neck to see over the mass of people still huddled by the ambulance bay. Still nothing.


Lucy laughed. Yeah, mustve been aliens. She said something to one of the kids again, then came back on the line. Ok, Im gonna go. Joey said hes about to throw up.


I said goodbye and ended the call. The commotion on the other end of the ER was growing as more people from other parts of the hospital had gotten there. Something smelled terrible.


I covered my nose and mouth with my shirt and stood up. I walked over to the window so I could get a better look at what was happening. The crowd had thinned slightly. I saw a few nurses running off, probably to pick up supplies. At the end of the hall were two gurneys with medical personnel hovering over them.


The smell got worse and I gagged inside my shirt. One of the gurneys began to move as someone pushed it down the hall.


I stood in the doorway and watched. As the victim came into view, my eyes widened. It was a young woman, covered from head to toe in what I could only describe as bubbles. Some were as small as a pea, others were the size of a grapefruit. They all throbbed and pulsated from some pressure inside them, and every so often, one would tear open and weep yellow fluid onto the gurney. The smell was overwhelming.


They pushed her into the room next to mine. I could see everything from the window in the wall. They didnt bother closing the curtains. I heard the other gurney being pushed by and glanced over at it. A girl, maybe 12 or 13. I shuddered.


I directed my gaze back at the person in the adjacent room. The doctors were popping bubbles to insert an IV. Fluid oozed onto the floor and I used every bit of self-control I could muster to avoid throwing up.


The womans eyes were wide and darting back and forth. It was an expression of terror. Terror and agony. As if sensing my stare, a thin stalk slid from the center of her left eye. The doctors shouted and backed up. The stalk elongated a little over a foot, and its tip grew a bubble of its own. The bubble expanded and the weight caused the stalk to droop. When it was the size of an orange, it stopped growing. It hung like an obscene fruit.


There was a yell from the room where theyd brought the other victim. I assumed it was for the same reason. On the other side of the window, more stalks emerged in a cluster from the womans other eye. All of them produced bubbles like a bunch of grapes.


My phone beeped. It was a text from Lucy. Can you go look outside? Its that light again!


As if on cue, every light in the hospital went out. The emergency lights clicked on for half a second, then they went dead. There was nothing - nothing but the stream of pink light coming in from the open ambulance bay doors.


I stepped in the hall and asked, to no one in particular, what was happening. I doubt anyone heard me, because the light shifted from pink to white, accompanied by a blast of noise I can only describe as static. It caused me to clasp my hands to my ears and retreat backward into the room, where I cowered in the corner.


I saw shadows passing in front of the white light reflecting off the floor. Bizarrely-shaped shadows. They moved in a way that was both jerky and fluid, like jelly suspended on bone. The shadows darkened as whatever was making them got closer. Doctors and nurses in the next room shrieked, and there was a flash which silenced them. Then, two feet away in the hall, harshly illuminated from the back by the piercing, white light, I saw it.


My initial thought of jelly suspended on bone wasnt very far off. Six ossified tubes carried heavy, segmented portions of sloshing, semi-transparent sacks. The first thing that came to mind was the body of a jellyfish. Bubbles and waving stalks decorated the entirety of its trunk and it walked by, either not noticing me or not caring about my presence. It reached the room of the other victim. Just like before, there was a scream, a flash of light, and then silence.


The light outside went dark. The sound stopped. The emergency lights in the hospital clicked on.


I scrambled to my feet and looked through the window at the room next to me. The doctors were writhing on the ground with burns on their exposed skin. The burns didnt look life threatening. But the woman on the gurney was gone. Nothing was left but the sticky, yellow fluid on the floor.


What the fuck was that?!, I yelled, and banged on the window. The person whod been stitching me up got off the floor, came back into the room, and asked me to sit down so he could finish. A nasty burn on the bridge of his nose wept tears of lymphatic fluid down his mouth and chin.


ABD code, he said. Abduction. Weve trained for them, but it was the first one I ever saw. Theyre not supposed to come back for the abductees, though. I wonder why they did that.


I sputtered and asked, You..you people have dealt with this? How isnt this going to be on the front page of every paper?


Well, youll forget about it in a couple hours. Everyone will. Better write down what you remember so you can tell your friends. Youll recall something happening, but you wont remember what it was.


I looked at him, stupefied. So how could you train for something like that? And how do you know it was your first one if you cant remember?


He shrugged. Its just what I was told. And good point about that other thing. He paused and I saw a series of nearly invisible, faded scars around his hairline. He smiled and nodded. Very good [point.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TITLE> 30 years ago today, my neighbor's son disappeared. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-31 15:24:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 30 years ago, my neighbors across the street, Mr. and Mrs. Stein, endured a terrible loss. Their son, Adam, disappeared on Halloween. It was assumed he was kidnapped, as there was a rash of kidnappings in the area at the time. The kidnapper was never found, though. Neither was Adam.


Todays the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. To the Steins, the wounds are still fresh. They refuse to decorate their yard, despite all the houses on the street going out of their way to be as festive as possible. They dont give out candy, despite the rest of the houses on the street trying to one-up each other by giving out better loot than their neighbors. 


The Steins mourn quietly in their dark house; the television being the only light emanating from their window. Kids are advised by their parents not to knock. 


Ive always felt bad for them. Ive lived here for 40 years. I remember the frantic search and rescue efforts that swept through our town. Even though I was barely 20 years old and living with my unemployed father while working double shifts to pay our mortgage, I did my part and joined the search. It was the least I could do.


Like all futile searches, it ended after a while. Adam was presumed dead. The Steins grew old and the neighborhood changed around us. New families moved in and old ones either died off or moved out. Aside from me and the Steins, Id say the average age of the homeowners here is 35. And they all have lots of kids.


A terrible rumor started to spread a couple years ago. I know who started it - an older kid named Chuck Demopoulos. He told his younger brothers and neighborhood friends that Adams ghost haunts the woods behind our street. He said Mr. Stein killed him and chopped him up into little bits. 


When I learned about the rumor, I was disgusted. The disrespect was so vulgar and uncalled for. I prayed the Steins wouldnt hear about it, but Im sure they must have. It was pervasive. I called Chucks father and told him what I heard, and I suspect Chuck caught a beating for it. Still, Im afraid the damage had already been done.


Despite pitying the Steins, I dont express my sympathy by refusing to decorate my house and yard. I love Halloween. Always have. I like to see parents beaming from the street while their kids nervously ring doorbells and collect piles of candy. The spirit of the season keeps me feeling young, despite being well past my prime and having to deal with high blood-pressure.


Being an old timer has its perks sometimes. I have Halloween decorations they dont sell anymore. Ghoulish stuff like hangmans nooses - things that are too politically incorrect for stores to sell. I firmly believe Halloween shouldnt be sanitized. It should be scary and unsettling.


That said, there needs to be an emotional component, too. Not just blood and guts for the sake of blood and guts. There needs to be poignancy. Something thatll stick with you after you see it. 


Thats why Adam helps me decorate.


After Dad died in 1989, I emptied out his safety deposit box. There was an envelope with note a note and a Polaroid photograph. All the note said was, I caught him snooping around the cellar. I had to teach him a lesson. The photograph was of fresh cement drying on the basement wall.


In the middle of the night, I went into the cellar and opened the wall. Adams body was inside. My instinctive reaction was to call the police, but I was terrified Id be arrested. Theyd never believe the note.


So I sealed the wall. After a while, I stopped thinking about the dead boy in the bowels of my house. Many years later, after talking with Mrs. Stein about Adam on a Halloween afternoon, I knew what I had to do. 


I took his remains out of the wall in 2014. He was only a skeleton. I separated the bones, splashed them with fake blood, and incorporated them into my Halloween decorations. At first, I was worried. As the days went by, though, I realized I didnt need to be concerned. The bones blended in with the rest of my decorations. Just more festive material in a neighborhood chock full of it.


This morning, when I went out to get the paper, Mr. Stein was doing the same. We met in the street and chatted for a while. We talked about the Cowboys game from last night and he mentioned his wife made a spectacular coffee cake that hed bring me a piece of later. I smiled and told him that would be real nice.


Before we parted ways, Mr. Stein said, I never told you how much Shannon and I appreciated all the help you gave us back when we lost Adam. We knew how busy you were. Its been 30 years today, you know. 30 years.


I felt guilt and sadness wash over me. Im sure hes in a better place, I told him.


He nodded, and I saw tears in his eyes. He was a good boy. I know wherever he is, hes watching over us.


We hugged briefly, then went back to our respective homes. I walked up the driveway, past the ghosts dangling from my trees by their nooses, and headed up my front steps. I looked at the skull hanging above the doorway. It was pointed at the Steins house. [Watching.](http://unsettlingstories.com)

<TEXT> Hey guys. I run [UnsettlingStories.com](http://unsettlingstories.com), a blog that features original horror stories that I've written. It started as a Tumblr blog, which is where the majority of my traffic still comes from, but I also get a decent bump from Reddit sometimes if one of my stories does well on /r/nosleep. 

When I was still on Tumblr, I had AdWords set up. My traffic was lower then, and I was getting between $100 and $200 per month. Since I started with WordAds on Wordpress, I have no idea what I've made yet, as I was approved for WordAds right in the beginning of September and they're slow to release numbers.

I've read online that the amount of traffic I get is decent enough, and I'm wondering if there's a better way to go about monetizing the thing so I can make more than the low hundreds of dollars, assuming the traffic stays around the same.

Any help or advice would be really appreciated.

<TITLE> The perks of working in a funeral home. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-28 17:16:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Working in a funeral home doesnt have many perks, so when one presents itself, its important to jump on it. Thats why closed-casket funerals are the best. You know the ones Im talking about. People who died in car accidents. Fires. Shotgun suicides. Anything that destroys the face and head of the deceased. No one wants to look at hamburger meat in a suit.


I was in charge of preparing the carcass of a middle-aged woman whod gotten half her head blown off in a gas explosion. We didnt even offer her family the option of an open casket. She was really fucked up.


The family gave us the dead ladys favorite dress and some of her jewelry. This is where the perks I mentioned come in. The bereaved are always so trusting. Over the course of the three years Ive had that job, I must have pawned $10,000 worth of necklaces and engagement rings and all sorts of other sentimental crap.


I figure its a victimless crime. The families think its in the coffin with their busted-up relative, so theyre happy, and the dead persons dead, so they dont care. Theyre in a better place, right? 


Anyway, you shouldve seen my face when I got the jewelry to bury with the gas-explosion lady. One locket caught my attention immediately. It was huge and looked like solid gold. I opened it up and saw pictures of the dead woman and others who looked like her mother, grandmother, and maybe even great grandmother, all smiling happily for the camera. The locket had space for five or six pictures. I figured itd be perfect for my girlfriend. She loves big and gaudy shit. We live three towns over, so there wasnt a chance shed get caught wearing it.


I pocketed the locket after everyone had left and I finished working on the dead chick. I wheeled the coffin into the fridge and headed out.


Liz was making dinner when I got home. I figured Id wait until bedtime to give her the present. We ate, watched a movie, and got ready to turn in.


After Liz got out of the shower, I surprised her with the locket. As Id expected, she loved the thing. It looked comically large on her tiny frame; the golden heart full of pictures was the size of a deck of cards against her chest. I thought she looked ridiculous, but she couldnt get enough. She opened it up and flipped through the photographs. Then she closed it, sat me down at her desk chair, and unzipped my pants.


Toward the end of one of the greatest blowjobs of my life, the sound of the dangling locket banging against the hardwood floor was starting to break my concentration. But then Liz did something shed never done and went all the way down. And I mean all the way. And that was all it took. 


When the world had unblurred and I could move my body again, I patted Lizs head and told her I didnt want to know where shed learned to do that, but if she wanted to do it every time she should feel free. Liz remained with her head between my legs. She didnt move.


Ok Liz, I said, starting to feel over sensitive and uncomfortable. Still, no response.


Liz?, I asked, starting to worry. I realized she wasnt breathing. Oh my God, what the fuck!, I yelled, and pushed her back. She separated from me and collapsed on the floor. Her eyes and nose were bleeding. Panic filled me as I stared at her motionless body.


Her bloody face was horrifying, but that wasnt what I was focusing on. It was the locket on her chest. The bright gold locket that now glowed dull red. It opened on its own. My eyes widened as I saw that the oldest picture, the one of the great grandmother, had changed. Her smile had become a scowl of rage. Page after page turned and I saw the once-smiling women were all frowning with hatred and indignity.


The photo of the women Id stolen the locket from was next. Her expression was one of seething animosity. My paralyzing terror kept me rooted to the chair, and I wondered how it could possibly get any worse. Then the page turned again. There was another picture. One that hadnt been there until right that very moment.


The photograph was of Liz, with blood streaming from her eyes and nose. In the picture, carved across her forehead with vicious precision, was the word THIEF. Only once the word started to appear on her forehead in real life, invisibly etched by some malevolent, ghostly hand, did I begin to scream.

<TEXT> I have an African grey parrot named Perry. Hes been part of the family for 25 years. Ive known him my whole life. When my parents were alive, they taught him a bunch of words and phrases and hed always make us laugh. 


Lately, though, hes been saying things we never taught him. Certainly not things wed ever say, either. Nancy, my wife, was in the kitchen with her friends the other day when they all heard Perry squawk, it bathes in tears and reigns beneath our feet.


They all laughed and wondered what the hell I couldve been watching on TV for the bird to pick up a phrase like that. They continued their lunch, but ten minutes later, Perry started again:


It reigns beneath our feet. It reigns beneath our feet. It reigns beneath our feet. 


Then he squawked and screamed and rattled his cage so hard that he almost fell off the table. Nancy checked to see if he was okay, and he chirped and allowed her to stroke his head with her finger. He seemed no worse for wear.


That night, after Id gotten home and Nancy had told me about Perrys weirdness, I let him out of his cage to fly around the house. He was always well behaved and never knocked anything off shelves or shit on things we cared about. He stepped out of the cage and onto the table, but he didnt take off. He just stood there, looking around.


Go ahead, Perry, I coaxed. Go get some exercise.


He remained stationary, but he watched me; the pupils wide in his beige eyes.


You okay buddy?, I asked. I was concerned for the little guy. Hed always been in great health and never acted weird. This was entirely unlike him.


Perry cocked his head and stared into my eyes. For some reason, I felt a chill run down my spine even before he spoke - almost like I knew he was about to frighten me.


In a deep tone Id never heard from him in all my years, he uttered, beneath your feet.


Something knocked on the floor directly below where I was standing. I jumped about a mile and stepped away from the bird, who hadnt moved. Still beneath your feet, he said. 


The knock came again. It was a hundred times louder and so powerful my ankle twisted under me and I fell sideways onto the couch. The floorboards where Id been standing bulged upward. One had cracked. Nancy came running downstairs asking, what the hell was that? I told her to go in the kitchen and call the police - someone was in the cellar.


Nancy and I waited by the door for the police to arrive. They got there quickly. We let them in and they went into the basement. A couple minutes later, they came back up. No ones there, they told us.


Wait, then what --


The older cop cut us off. Can you come look at something with us?


Okay, Nancy said, but what is it?


Just come downstairs.


We followed the cops into the basement. Neither Nancy nor I go down there very often. I was a little embarrassed by how gross and dusty it was until I saw marks in the dust-covered floor and countertops. 


Are those footprints?, I asked, more to myself than to anyone around.


Thats what we thought, said the younger officer. But they look pretty weird for footprints.


We got to the part of the cellar that was under where Id been standing. The cops aimed their flashlights at the wood above our heads. An indentation was clearly visible. It almost looked like a punch, but the shape wasnt of any hand wed ever seen. It looked like it had too many knuckles; too many bones.


What the hell? I traced my finger over the indentations. I shivered.


Upstairs, Perry squawked. The floorboards around the indentation began to leak. Liquid dripped into my mouth and I sputtered. It was salty and reminded me of the taste you get after crying for a long time.


Did something spill upstairs?, the older cop asked. 


Yeah, maybe the bird knocked something over.


Is that him making all that noise?


I nodded. Hes been weird all day.


We headed back upstairs and the cops told us to call if we have any other concerns about someone being in our house. Nancy and I thanked them, and they left.


I stared at the damage to the living room floor. Perry hadnt knocked anything over, but there was a small puddle on the wood. Hed gone back into his cage and sat in the corner, quietly clucking. I approached the cage. There were little, wet footprints around it. They were his prints. It looked like he mightve lapped up some of the water thatd been on the floor while we were in the cellar.


Whats going on, bud? You having a rough day? I tried not to think about what had happened. There had to be a reason for it. Maybe the wood had warped. The basements always been damp and gross. That had to have been it. The wood warped and trapped moisture was dripping out of the fracture point. But then there was Perry.


Perry stared at the bottom of the cage, still clucking. He didnt look up. I reached out to pet his head, but he struck my finger with his beak. Not hard enough to do any damage, but with enough force to let me know he wanted none of my affection.


I looked at my pet with sympathy, wondering if he was just getting old and losing his mind. He remained in the corner, trembling slightly. Something caught my eye. There was red on the cage where he was sitting. I looked closer. It was blood.


What happened, Perry?, I asked, and reached inside to pick him up, knowing I was in for a pecking. Before I could grab him, he spoke in that same, chilling voice:


It will bathe in blood and claim the sky. He paused, then slowly spoke. Twenty.... seven days.


I picked up my bird to see how badly he was hurt. But before I could assess his wound, I saw what was in the corner where he was sitting. Something entirely unexpected.


Perry, my male, African grey parrot, had been sitting on a bloody, black egg.


Its been 24 hours since all this started. Perry seems no worse for wear, but he fights whenever we try to pick him up. He does everything he can to remain by the egg. I dont know whats happening to him and I have no idea what he means with any of the stuff hes saying. Whenever he talks now, its just 26 days followed by the word hours. The number of hours keeps going down. And I havent heard it, but Nancy swears she hears soft knocking coming from the basement each time Perry makes his announcements.

<TITLE> Rotting Pumpkins </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-26 16:52:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The farm near our house had a jack-o-lantern pumpkin patch on Halloween. It was pretty cool to look at; a whole field filled with meticulously-carved pumpkins with their grotesque faces glowing from the candlelight within. There was candy strewn about in little baggies, and kids of all ages visited either before or after they trick-or-treated to get some extra loot.

We moved in across the street from that field a couple years ago. At first, we loved the idea of the jack-o-lantern patch. It looked quite haunting and really spoke to the Halloween spirit in me and my wife. But when Halloween was over, the farmer didnt take the jack-o-lanterns away. He left them to rot.

I assumed it was to fertilize the ground for whatever crop hed plant in the spring. It made sense he wouldnt want all that organic material to go to waste. The problem was, theyd attract animals. Animals and bugs. In the unseasonably-warm November we had last year, the smell of the rotting gourds brought critters from far and wide to the field, and when they were done eating, theyd wander the neighborhood.

Being a small town, there was little anyone could do to stop the farmer, whose name was Ruben, from doing what he wanted on his property. We had to deal with the deer and skunks and coyotes and foxes and flies and bees and bats all eating and shitting and fucking their way across the town until no more pumpkins were left.

Last year, I approached Ruben while he was setting up the jack-o-lanterns. He was a friendly guy, there was never any doubting that. I explained the issue and he listened and nodded. He said a few other people had told him the same thing, and hed fixed the fences over the summer so that wouldnt be a problem anymore.

Besides, he told me with a smile, last year was just a test run. This Halloween, everythings going to be just perfect.

On Halloween, the jack-o-lantern field looked even better than it had the year before. Even though the arrangement was the same, Ruben had hired some artists to collaborate and create truly monstrous designs for the pumpkins. They were awesome. I even did a walk through by myself in the early afternoon before the candles were lit just to take it all in. I felt like a kid again.

As the evening was coming to a close and wed given out the majority of our candy to the neighborhood children, we were getting ready to turn off the light and lock up when we heard sirens approaching. I looked outside and saw a procession of police cars and fire engines and ambulances heading toward us. I stepped out on the porch and watched as they passed our house and took the sharp left into the driveway of Rubens farmhouse.

I sat on the steps with my wife and watched as lights were flipped on and the field was partially illuminated. Oh my God, I whispered.

In the harsh, overhead lights, I saw bodies on the ground among the glowing jack-o-lanterns. Small ones. Small, costumed ones. Kids. Oh my God, I repeated, louder.

Paramedics and rescue officials descended on the field and worked to resuscitate the still bodies. One by one, they gave up. Parents were arriving in droves and the sound of wailing and hysteria filled the air. My wife and I held one another as little bodies with sheets over them were loaded into ambulances.

The next morning, it was all over the news. 32 children dead in an apparent poisoning. Ruben was arrested and questioned. He refused to speak to the investigators and he was held without bail.

Funerals were held and pumpkins began to rot. It was another unseasonably-warm November, and on cue, insects began to discover the field. Clouds of flies drifted in and out, blanketing the field in a gray haze as they left their eggs in the pumpkins softening flesh.

In the following days, toxicology reports on the autopsied children came back. Whatever had poisoned them was still unknown. Theyd exhibited all the outward signs of a poisoning: cyanosis, hemorrhage, paralysis, etc.  but no toxins were found in their bodies. Tissue samples were held for further testing, but the corpses were released to the families.

Two weeks later, the air was still thick with flies and bees. We still hadnt had a frost, and things that crawled and flew feasted on the pulpy remains of the jack-o-lanterns. From the house, I could see their deformed, hideous faces; faces which no longer evoked a feeling of holiday fun. They were faces that mocked the dead.

The incredibly warm autumn continued. 20 degrees above average, according to the weather man. Flowers were blooming and the cherry trees had blossomed a full five months ahead of time. The pumpkins were still there, but mostly formless, having succumbed to rot and the ravenousness of vermin. As the hot November slouched into December, the luckiest of us had started to forget about the tragedy that had befallen the town. But we still got reminders  especially on December 2nd, when Ruben broke his silence.

My cousin, Ron, works for the police department as a mechanic. He doesnt have any access to criminals or official information, but he talks to cops a lot. And the cops like to talk.

Ron came over on the 2nd before any news had gotten out about what Ruben was saying. It was clear he was uncomfortable. Lillian and I sat and listened while Ron relayed what his buddy had learned from the detective.

The Ruben I knew was nothing like the man being described by my cousin. Hed blanketed himself with cuts and scars of indecipherable symbols and words. Every inch of his flesh was carved or mutilated in one way or another  something hed done with his fingernails over the course of the time he was in jail.

The detectives learned that Ruben was ready to talk when he began to scream the names of each dead child. Just after midnight on the 2nd, he shouted each first, middle, and last name until his voice was hoarse. Detectives stood on the other side of his cell and transcribed what he said. They didnt understand most of it, but it was better than nothing. The main takeaway was a date and time. December 5th, 11:00 pm.

No one could figure out what he meant by it, so there was a lot of speculation. All the police could do was park a unit over by the farm overnight just in case he had something planned. On the 5th, I sat with Lillian and Ron on the front porch and stared at the black field in front of us. 11:00 came, and nothing happened. We waited for a few minutes. I saw the cop across the street standing next to his car, smoking a cigarette.

As we were getting ready to go inside, I saw something flicker in the field. A tiny flame. Look, I told the others, and pointed. They saw it too. More flickers came into view.

Hey!, I yelled to the cop, and kept pointing at the field. The cop snuffed out his cigarette and walked around the barn to take a look. He got to the side of the field, then raised his radio to call for backup.

As we watched, the flickers intensified, as if they were from new candles thatd finally started properly burning their wicks after sputtering and threatening to go out. After only a couple minutes, more police cars arrived. I got up started to cross the street. I needed to see what was going on.

Dont, said Lillian as she grabbed my hand, but I shrugged her off and headed toward the fence. I heard Ron walking behind me.

The police arrived and lit the field up with their search lights. We could see the rotten pumpkins sitting in the field, all with single candles sticking out of them. They were shaking. One by one, candles fell and hit the dry straw. The straw ignited. Police officers called for emergency assistance from the fire department, but there was no chance theyd get there in time. The fire began to rage.

Entombed in flame, the rotten pumpkins started to burst. Only after their pulpy bodies had disintegrated did we see what was inside. Oh my fucking God, Ron half whispered, half prayed.

In the place of each pumpkin, there was a small, human-shaped thing sitting with its head down and its knees clutched to its chest. The heat intensified further and I backed up, but I still saw it all. One by one, the things rose on sturdy legs and stood erect. They were growing, and soon they reached the size of the children whod died.

Their skin began to char, and they walked out of the flames toward the crowd of police officers. Without any idea what to do, but terrified out of their minds, some began to shoot. The bullets did not stop them. Round after round tore through the fire-spawned children, exiting their backs and legs and heads in a geyser of gore, but they walked ever forward.

Soon, the officers whod fired fell to the ground. They didnt move for a second, but then they started to rot. Just like the pumpkins. Other officers backed away. Id backed all the way up to my house, and I watched from the doorway with my wife and cousin. We were horrified.

A procession of children walked down the street, followed by the police cars. Firefighters worked to put out the blazing field, and after a little while, theyd succeeded.

Ron turned on his police scanner and we sat in the living room, listening with horror as news of dead cops and other officials came in:

*The children have reached the prison.*

*The children have burned through the cell of Ruben Rendell.*

*The children are carrying Rendell back the way they came.*

Oh fuck, I said, and opened the front door. They were coming back down the street  a procession of blackened, smoldering kids carrying a burning man. Ruben. And he was screaming.

ITS ALMOST DONE! ITS ALMOST FINISHED!

He screamed with peals of hysterical laughter as he burned. The children carried him to the field and placed him in the center. They then placed themselves in the same spots as the pumpkins from which theyd emerged. Most had gone out, while some still glowed with dull, red fire.

Before Ruben burned to death, he unleashed one final scream:

PLEASE ACCEPT THIS OFFERING! IS THIS ENOUGH? IS THIS WHAT YOU NEEDED? SEE ME THROUGH! SEE! ME! THROUGH!

There was no sound from him after that final word. Nothing but the crackling of dying flames.

The following days were a whirlwind of investigations, media visits, and speculation. No one knew what happened. No one knew what Ruben had done. And for a while, it was still a mystery how the kids had been poisoned in the first place.

A mystery, that is, until Jasmine McCray, the mother of a child who was fortunate enough to have been too sick to trick-or-treat, found a small letter in her sons toy chest. It read:

For a special night of Halloween fun, draw this little picture on a piece of paper and swallow it, then come to Farmer Rubens pumpkin patch to trick-or-treat. You will never, ever want to leave.

The picture was of an inverted star. A pentagram.

Jasmines son told her Ruben had given them to kids at recess one day after he talked to the classes about what it was like to be a farmer. He came to them individually and made them promise to throw it away after they read it and not to tell their parents.

Jasmine gave the letter to the police, and then told the media. While the superstitious residents of the town took that as an answer to what had happened, skeptics like myself couldnt believe it. Even after what Id seen, I couldnt believe something supernatural had occurred.

But then the photographs came in. The aerial photographs from the news helicopter the day after the holocaust at the field. Clearly marked in carbon and ash was the shape of a pentagram  the exact shape the pumpkins had been arranged in. No one had noticed it from the ground.

And at the center of the pentagram, where Ruben had screamed his final, pleading prayer, four words were burnt into the dirt. The answer to the old farmers prayers.

<TEXT> Last Halloween at 11:25 pm, the doorbell rang. Id just gotten into bed. Thinking I could ignore it and go to sleep, I clicked off the TV and pulled the covers up. The doorbell sounded again. And again. And again.


I threw off the covers, put on my bathrobe, and stormed out of the bedroom. If it was a group of kids playing a prank, I told myself, even their parents wouldnt be able to identify their bodies. I unlocked and opened the front door.


On the doorstep was a young boy wearing a Native American headdress and an ornately-beaded leather vest and pants. He was clutching a bag of candy to his chest. No one else was around.


It was unseasonably cold that night, and without any adults around, I couldnt let the kid stay out there and freeze. He looked miserable. I held him by his shoulder and guided him inside, then I picked him up and placed him on the couch. I didnt know what to do. Calling the police seemed like the only safe bet, so I dialed the non-emergency number. While I waited on hold, I heated up some water to make the kid a mug of hot chocolate.


The kid stared at me while I stood in the kitchen. He didnt say a word. I felt bad for the little guy.


The receptionist at the police station answered and I told her what was going on. She said she hadnt heard about any missing kids, but as soon as a car was free, one would be sent over. She cautioned it might be a while, though. Apparently Halloweens a busy time for them over there.


With the water boiled and the instant hot chocolate made, I went over to the kid and sat down next to him on the couch. I placed the mug on the table across from us. After cautioning him that it was hot, I figured I needed to talk to him.


Nice costume, I told him. It wasnt really that nice. Pretty culturally insensitive nowadays. But whatever.


Thanks, he replied.


So, um, did you lose your parents?, I asked. 


The kid shook his head.


How about your brothers or sisters? Or friends?


Again, no.


Want to try the hot chocolate? Its really good.


I dont like chocolate.


Oh, okay. I picked up the mug and started drinking, wondering if the kid was slow or something. Who doesnt like chocolate?


We sat in silence for a little while. He kept his eyes on the unpowered television while I did everything in my power to not appear creepy. I never know how to act around kids.


Did you have a good time trick-or-treating?, I asked, then realized it was a stupid question. Hed gotten separated from his family or friends, for fucks sake. How good could it have been?


The kid, to my surprise, nodded. I got what I wanted, he said.


Oh? And what was that?


The doorbell rang and I hopped off the couch and answered it. Two officers. I invited them in and they saw the boy on the sofa. They greeted him and asked the same questions I had. He had nothing to say to them, though. In fact, he looked angry - almost like he hated them.


After a few minutes of getting nowhere, the officers said they were going to bring him back to the station. There still hadnt been any reports of a missing child.


As they were about to leave, there was a call on the police radio. Something about a murder on 113 Chestnut Place. The three of us stood very still for a moment. I live at 115 Chestnut. My neighbors, Paul and Lynn Chesney, had lived there for decades and were the curators at the local museum. 


The officers answered the call on their radio said they were nearby. They were told backup would be there shortly.


Wait here, the cops ordered, and the kid and I just looked at each other while the two men left the house and headed next door.


Dont worry, its okay, I promised the boy. He looked flat. Unaffected. Then he turned and looked straight at me.


Bring this to the MTIC. It all belongs to them. He handed me his bag. I was extremely confused for a second, wondering why the local Mohegan tribe would want Halloween candy. I opened the bag and gasped. 


A bloody, stone knife sat atop a pile of beautiful, beaded vestments, ornate carvings, and other, old-looking artifacts.


Your neighbors have been keeping these from us. We tried to get them back, but they just laughed and mocked our efforts. But theyre too important to give up - especially after weve been forced to give up so much.


I stood like an idiot, holding the bag as sirens approached and the commotion outside grew. 


Give it to them, the kid shouted with a deep, adult voice that was entirely out of place coming from his small body. And with that, he vanished. The headdress and pants and vest dropped in a pile on the rug. I spent a good 45 minutes convincing myself I hadnt gone nuts.


Hours later, an officer came back for the boy. What happened over there?, I asked the cop. I already knew, but I needed confirmation. 


Looks like the couple got killed in a robbery attempt, he told me. Their daughter came home from a Halloween party and found them with their throats cut. Im sorry.


I let out a long sigh and nodded.


Wheres the kid?, the officer asked.


I had an answer ready. There was a family going door to door with a picture of him. I guess hed run away. But hes back with them now.


The cop shook his head. And they didnt even call us? Christ. He paused. Well, okay. Goodnight. Im sorry about your neighbors - well have officers in the area until whoever did it is found.


I thanked him and closed the door. It was almost 5:00 am. It was too late to go to bed; I had work in a couple hours. So I sat down at my computer, and with the kids bag on the desk next to me, I mapped out directions for my drive to the MTIC.

<TEXT> It took two days to hike to the spot wed heard about: a strange house standing alone in the middle of the woods. And if it couldnt possibly sound any more cliche, the rumors were that the former owners of the house haunted it and killed anyone who dared to enter.

From the outside, it looked unremarkable. Had it not been in the middle of the forest with nothing around but trees and rocks, the house wouldve looked like any other run-down home in a bad area. But the fact remained: it was the only man-made structure for miles. Why, let alone how, anyone would haul construction materials through the inhospitable wilderness to build the place was beyond my or my boyfriends understanding.

Being journalists for the high school paper, we came armed with our notebooks and tablets. John tried to peer through the windows, but there was nothing to see. The windows were smoked out - it looked like thered been a minor fire inside at some point.

The front door was locked, but around the back there was a rusted-out hole in the cellar door. It was just wide enough for John to fit through. No way my boobs were getting through that hole unless I did way more squashing than I was in the mood to do. No, it was okay; John would go through and open the front door for me.

After a bit of squeezing and cursing, John made his way into the cellar. Looking at the ragged, rusty metal hed just forced himself through, I wondered when hed last gotten a tetanus booster. With a shudder, I made my way over to the front of the house and waited for him to let me inside.

I waited. And waited. After a couple minutes, I heard John banging on the door from behind to get it open.

It doesnt want to move, he shouted from the other side.

Can you find something to break it open?, I called back. A crowbar or something?

The banging stopped as he looked around. More waiting. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a doe and her fawn. I was spellbound. Growing up in the city, this had been my first trip into the woods since I was a little girl. Id never gotten to see deer in real life. 

I carefully moved in the direction of the animals, crouching low so I didnt frighten them, and held out my hand. The ears of the deer perked up and they watched me intently, trying to determine if I was a threat. In my head, I was pleading with them to come over.

Its okay guys, I whispered sweetly. Its okay.

I held my breath as the fawn stepped toward me. It was so close. The mother wasnt stopping it as it got nearer and nearer - so close that I could see my reflection in its wide, inquisitive eyes.

A massive bang sounded from behind me, making me jump and sending the deer running for their lives. God damn it, John!, I yelled, turning around. You scared them aw--.

I stopped talking and froze. The door had flown off its hinges onto the front steps. In the doorway stood a thick, bulbous, corpse-like man. He was swollen and burned, almost like hed been soaked in gasoline for months then set on fire. And in his hand he held the severed head of John, whose eyes stared straight ahead with confused shock.

I screamed and began to run. Stay away from our home!, came a voice so loud and powerful it caused me to stumble and fall. I righted myself and looked over my shoulder, tears streaming down my eyes. There was another thing now - a woman - standing shoulder to shoulder with Johns murderer. Her mouth opened and she bellowed, and dont fucking come back!

She lumbered down the steps and picked up the door. She carried it back up, and before she set it back in the remains of its frame, the husband took Johns head and threw in my direction. I heard it hit the ground behind me as I ran, but I never saw his face again. Never, except in my nightmares.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In February of 2004, I was employed as a housekeeper for a wealthy real-estate developer. Id been gone for a few days; my uncle had died and Id traveled from New York to Florida on short notice to help with the arrangements. I came back one day earlier than Id planned. My boss was quite irate when I told him I was leaving in the first place, so I thought an early return might help put me back in good graces.

I got to the penthouse around 3am, ready to get a jump on the days work. According to the schedule my boss had given me, hed be home later the following day and expected the place to be spotless. I dont care if youre still in your funeral clothes while you scrub the toilet, were his final words to me before I left for Florida.

When the private elevator reached the residence, I was surprised to see all the lights were on. Like I said, he wasnt supposed to be back for almost 30 hours. None of the other staff were scheduled, either. 

A strange sound caused me to jerk my head in the direction of the dining room. I couldnt identify the noise at all. It was like a mewl and a groan and a gasp all at once. Whatever it was, it was very unsettling. I waited and listened. There was a voice. A familiar one. My bosss adult son.

I couldnt make out what he was saying, but I felt a little better. At least it hadnt been a burglar. I put my supplies on the counter and headed toward the dining room.

The doors were shut. Almost shut. One was slightly ajar, and I could see movement on the other side. That strange sound came again, this time quieter. More like a sigh. Gooseflesh rose on my arms and neck. I tiptoed over to the doors and peered inside. Had the son not coughed the moment I stifled a gasp, they wouldve heard me.

My boss sat at the head of the table with his face between the legs of a dying girl. Her throat had been cut. The sounds Id heard were her pained, gurgling breaths. The son, whose back was to me, held the girl down as her flailing tapered off. Her head came to rest with her eyes fixed in my direction; eyes that locked onto mine. Eyes that screamed help with silent desperation.

She didnt move after that. I swallowed a scream.

I heard my boss grunt, bring her mother out to clean it up.

His son crossed the room and unlocked the gold and black-glass cabinet thatd stood in the corner for as long as Id worked there. I couldnt see him opening the door, but I heard a terrible, howling wail as the woman trapped inside was released and saw the remains of her daughter.

Oh shut up, my boss yelled at her. Then he chuckled. My boys going to put another one in you soon enough.

The whole scene had lasted less than two minutes, but those minutes were indelibly etched on my consciousness. On my psyche. On my soul.

I left the residence as quietly as Id entered. In the lobby, I saw the lone, overnight security officer who'd let me in. Abdullah. He'd always been kind to me. "Please, please, please don't mention I was here," I begged. He looked bewildered, but then he nodded. He hated our boss as much as anyone.

The moment I exited the building, I called 911 from one of the few remaining pay phones and told the dispatcher what Id seen. I didnt give my name and I disguised my voice as best as I could. Then I waited by the subway entrance until the police cars and ambulances arrived.

I got home where I tossed and turned and cried for sleepless hours as I pictured the poor girl, who couldnt have been older than nine or ten, bleeding out as she was so hideously violated. Even now, 12 years later, the scene is as sharp in my mind as it had been that night.

The next day, I got the newspaper, ready to see his awful, smirking face on the cover with a headline declaring him a murderer. But there was no such thing. I flipped through each page, poring over the stories and looking for his name. Nothing. I rushed to my computer and searched online. Headlines about his TV show and his business dealings were all over, but nothing about an arrest; nothing that even hinted at an investigation.

Sickness washed over me as I realized his money and influence had certainly kept his crime quiet. I sobbed at home all day.

The following morning, after Id somehow slept for a couple hours, my phone rang. Why the fuck arent you at work, a voice screamed. It was him. I couldnt speak at first. My mind was blank. After nearly a full minute, I stuttered, I...Im sorry. Ill be in as soon as I can. He hung up.

Everything went gray as I realized I couldnt leave the job. If I did, hed know itd been me who called the police. If I even momentarily showed fear or uncertainty, he would figure it out. I had to go to work. I had to do what he told me until I was absolutely sure hed never learn Id discovered his secret.

So I went to work. I went like nothing was wrong at all, aside from how I claimed I was still mourning the death of my uncle. It was an excuse, but it was one he bought. Get your shit together, he demanded. And I did. My first order of business was to clean a stain on the dining-room table that he said had shown up out of nowhere.

As I scrubbed and held back a scream of indignant anguish, I did everything I could to pretend I was somewhere else. Anywhere but where I stood. And, for the most part, it worked. All I had to do was lie to myself and pretend I didnt hear the nearly-inaudible sound of muffled crying coming from from the gold and black-glass cabinet in the corner.

<TEXT> I wont let my kids trick-or-treat this Halloween. Not after what happened last year. Not when half the towns parents are still in mourning and every other week you see cribs and twin-sized beds by the curb for anyone to come by and pick up. Theyre stark reminders that the losses cut deep around here. The pains still there. And even if those wounds have started to heal for some, theyll always, always itch.

Last year, kids received tainted candy. 55 got sick, 31 died. It was all over the news, so I dont need to go into a background story that you already know. My girls were lucky; theyre both allergic to peanuts so they just gave the candies to their friends. Friends they dont have anymore.

I remember my shift in the ER when the kids started trickling in. It took a few days. The first one was on November 3rd - a four-year old named Regina. She was having trouble breathing. At first, we thought it was an allergic reaction, but none of the treatments seemed to work. As she got worse, it was only after wed scoped her to get a look inside her lungs that we realized what was happening. By then, though, it was too late. She died on the table.

Three more young kids came in that night. They all died.

The next day, the trickle became a flood. Older kids joined the younger ones with trouble breathing. These seemed worse off than the kids from the night before. The initial symptoms had given way to the secondary ones before death, so we had to deal with the shock and terror they were experiencing as their condition progressed.

The CDC representatives arrived not long after ten more had died, and they were able to quickly trace the source to contaminated candy. The local chocolate producer was determined to be at fault, and a speedy investigation revealed exactly how the candies were contaminated. The business was shut down. The owners are still tied up in court cases for their negligence and refusal to comply with proper importation safeguards.

Like I said, after a year, its all still fresh in the minds of so many families. Theyll go their whole lives associating the holiday with death and devastation, rather than fun and excitement. Out of respect for that, few yards are decorated for Halloween nowadays. There are some pumpkins on front steps, but no real displays. Well, thered been one.

A Japanese family whod moved to town in August had been mostly unaware of the circumstances surrounding the tragedy. Theyd bought the house across the street from me. Excited to celebrate Halloween in America for the first time, they decorated their front lawn with skeletons, pumpkins, monsters, and spiders. A couple neighbors visited the next day and carefully explained to them what had happened the year before. The decorations were down within an hour.

It wasnt that anyone was truly angry that the decorations were there. Most of them were fine. Had they just left three of the four things up, no one wouldve complained. Hell, some people who were lucky enough to not have been touched by the tragedies might have appreciated a little Halloween spirit. But for some, seeing that one thing was just too much. Even I, who hadnt lost anyone, cringed a little when I saw the setup.

It made me think back to that night on November 3rd when Regina came in. I remembered the scope going down into her lungs. I remembered how we stared at the screen in a combination of horror and fascination. 

It wasnt a skeleton or a pumpkin or a monster that had killed those children. It was the spiders. The millions of tiny, black spiders whose eggs had been in the cocoa powder decorating the finished chocolate and peanut-butter candies. 

The kids whod suffocated before the spiders had exited their lungs were the lucky ones. It was those in the waiting room or car or ambulance who hacked and coughed up clouds of them as they died who had it worst. 

The Japanese family apologized profusely as they removed all the decorations. It was obvious they were mortified. As I watched them out the window, I saw Giichi wave his wife, Ai, over to get a close look at the lawn. Her eyes widened and she put her hand over her mouth. I couldnt see what they were looking at, but I knew what it was.

Ever since last November, thereve been webs all over the place. Theyre small - only the size of a quarter - but immediately recognizable as being from the same Honduran spider thatd been accidentally imported by the chocolate shop owners. The towns infested with them. I try not to get too close to the corners and eaves of my house because I know theyre there. Harmless, but there. Just another cruel reminder. One of many.

I havent touched a piece of chocolate in over 350 days. I dread having to use the scope when Im at work in the ER. And nearly every night I dream about how it all happened, only to jolt awake with the feeling of spiders squirming through my lungs and sinuses.

<TEXT> Like so many things, it started with a bright spot in the night sky. As I watched, it grew brighter. Closer. Before long, I could hear it. It was loud and constant; a freight train riding a persistent thunderclap. Birds were roused from their sleep and they took to the sky, soaring away from the threatening light and sound. I didnt move, though. I had to see.

It struck the ground in the woods outside my property, perhaps a quarter mile away. A second later, a searing blast of heat and pressure singed my eyebrows and threw me to the ground. My daze, while not insubstantial, was pushed to the side by excitement and wonder. 

I scrambled to my feet and ran toward the impact site. The woods were alive with fire; orange plasma licking the evergreens as the sap within boiled and hissed. I passed the charred bodies of squirrels and deer as I darted around the hottest spots of quickly-dying flames. Before long, I was there.

The crater was about as wide and as deep as a backyard swimming pool. At its center was a red rock. Bright red. Fire-engine red. Its color wasnt from heat, I noticed with some surprise, as feathery rime crept with fractalic persistence over its exposed surface. 

For a moment, there was no sound.

I peered into the crater and watched the rime crawl up the rock, wondering how ice could form so close to the still-smoldering brush and dirt alongside it. On the other side of the object, out of my view, a sliver of yellow light flashed. Before I could go around to investigate, a crack spread on the surface of the rock. Dazzling, hypnotic sparkles of yellow and green filled my eyes.

I woke up on the forest floor at some point in the morning. The fires were out. Whatever had been in the crater had crumbled to dust. Without any knowledge of how Id lost consciousness, I felt fear tickle the back of my neck. Almost as quickly as it started, though, the feeling evaporated. All my concern evaporated. For the first time in my 40 years of life, I felt wonderful. At peace.

I followed the trail that had been left for me. It led to my garage. Impelled to write something to let the world know what had and would be happening to me, I took my phone from my pocket and started to type.

And here I am.

Here we are.

I hadnt noticed the gossamer-thin tendril stretching from my forehead to the pilot until wed officially met. Its eyestalks perked up upon seeing me enter the garage, and it extruded newer, thicker filaments from its bulk to greet me. They stopped at my clothes, slapping weakly and wetly against the fabric until I got the message and stripped them off. Unhindered, the finger-thick filaments, now perhaps tendrils, pushed into me.

I tasted the cosmos with my skin, and every exposed surface of my body sang in an electric choir of caressed nerves. 

Let them know how it feels, the Pilot whispered in me.

The sensation was that of being licked by ten thousand tongues, if ten thousand tongues were the emissaries of ten billion galaxies. I felt stars blink into existence on my chest and detonate in supernovae chaos upon my hands and feet. Pulsars fondled my shoulders while civilizations discovered fire and tamed the atom on my cheeks and under my scalp. 

Have them come to us so we can let them feel, the Pilot breathed throughout me.

I dialed 911 and sighed the words, officer down at 133 Rural Route 5.

It didnt take long.

The Pilot kissed each one with its tendrils the moment they arrived. The stellar choir of skin and taste grew by nine. 

The Pilot, too, had grown. It filled the entirety of the garage; its filaments and tendrils and tentacles poking and pouring out of windows and doorways. The ground grew slick with its excretions. We stood - we stand - inside, all connected. All consumed and all consuming. All feeling.

More calls have been made and our network of flesh will only increase. The Pilot is gifting us with poetry to swallow; concepts that can only be understood once theyve been tasted. Once theyve been digested. Once theyve been incorporated.

It is with a fleeting sense of loss that I recall the man who Id once been. A man who, just last night, succumbed to his fervid curiosity and ran toward the fire. Never once did he care about being burnt; never once did he worry about what may happen. And now he is here. Now I am here. Now we are here. It was his desire to learn - and now he knows everything.

The Pilot has broken through the roof of the garage and is towering above the forest. It tells me if I were to measure, it would be a mile. One mile of the Pilot stretching like a gray-green obelisk toward the cosmos which birthed it.

More sirens puncture the tranquility of our home on the outskirts of the forest. Soon, they will stop. The Pilot can now reach aircraft with its tendrils, which have grown strong enough to break through. And those bodies inside are now with us. We all taste stars - we all bathe in radiation and fling ourselves toward the expanding borders of the universe in simultaneous orgasm. 

The Pilot whispers he is 20 miles tall now. Depending where you are, if you look outside, you might see it. If you do, dont be afraid. Dont be anxious. Just feel the one, final moment of your loneliness. Of your solitude. Then open your windows, smile, and wait.

Its time for you to meet the universe.

<TITLE> Psalms of Savagery, part 1: Lisette </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-17 16:45:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im an IT contractor for the FBI. I learned about a serial killer whose crimes are being actively hidden the by the Bureau and by state and local police departments. I believe it is my duty to bring these crimes to light. The files Ive taken detail the criminal acts and the evidence associated with them. I will share portions of the files over the course of the next week or so, starting with this one today. People cant live under a false impression of safety.

On May 3rd, 2016, Lisette Jan Aronowitz, 43, was found dead by her husband at their home in Bethesda, MD. She had been crucified. Nails had been driven through her hands and feet, anchoring her to the brick wall above the fireplace. It is assumed Lisette was alive during the crucifixion.

The victims eyes and teeth had been removed. Her eye sockets were filled with the excised teeth; top teeth in the left socket, bottom teeth in the right. These injuries are also assumed to have been inflicted while the Lisette was alive.

Death appears to have been the result of internal injuries from repeated blunt-force trauma to the abdomen. Bruising patterns suggest a cross-shaped object.

There was no indication that Lisette had been sexually assaulted. However, blood, hair, and semen were found at the crime scene. Each sample was contained in small, individual ramekins on the floor below the victim. The victims left eye was in the ramekin containing hair while the right eye was in the ramekin containing blood.

Federal databases have no record of the DNA found at the scene. Fingerprints, while numerous, were also not on record.

The autopsy of Lisette yielded a great deal of evidence with little-to-no clues about who the murderer may have been. In the place of each tooth, small pieces of frankincense resin had been inserted below the gum line. The interior of the eye sockets were coated in myrrh oil. A cut had been made in the soft palate, where a gold coin was found. The obvious biblical connection was not overlooked.

While the killers general motive remains a mystery, a small amount of illumination was gleaned from the contents of 83 small incisions in the flesh of Lisettes back and buttocks. Inside each incision was a plastic-wrapped piece of paper, on which one word, number, or punctuation mark was written.

A cursory examination of the words suggested another biblical connection, and when they were fed into a pattern-matching database, their source was revealed.

**Psalms 64: 1-2, 9-10**

***1*** *Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.* ***2*** *Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the plots of evildoers.* ***9*** *All people will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.* ***10*** *The righteous will rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him; all the upright in heart will glory in him!*

The case is still under investigation, but the official report made no mention of the ritualistic nature of the murder. All inquiries into the case are being denied. Further, the lack of details released have prevented any connections being made between Lisettes murder and the murder of at least four others.

But I have the details. And in the coming days, so will you.

<TEXT> My story gracing the top of NoSleep at the moment is predictable and unoriginal. But I had fun writing it, and I knew it would do well. I have a few stories with 2k+ that I'd give a C- to that only got noticed because they're shocking and/or gross. 

Bugs in my stories are certainly a cliche, but I'll be damned if they're not popular. The stories I've written that I actually like and consider original barely break 1k, and it's not because they're qualitatively worse, but because it's not the type of thing NoSleep reinforces with upvotes.

<TEXT> Keep in mind, Id never even considered giving a ride to a stranger before. All my life, Id been told thats how you get killed. Only crazies hitchhike, theyd say. Theyll cut your throat and steal your car and youll be dead in a ditch.

I didnt want to die in a ditch. And I liked my car. But after Id left the gas station and I saw the poor guy sitting in the gutter on the I-95 onramp, feebly holding out his thumb, I made my choice. Id be a good samaritan.

The storm in the distance looked pretty threatening. If I let that guy sit there, hed have to bear the brunt of it. From the looks of him, he didnt appear to be able to bear much at all. I pulled over to the side and rolled down the window.

Where you looking to go?, I asked him.

Baltimore, he replied. His voice was stronger than his sickly body had suggested, and that gave me pause. I looked him over again. Dirty jeans, baggy red t-shirt. No bag, no bulges in his pockets. I sighed.

I can get you as far as Philly. He nodded. Hop in, I told him, unlocking the door.

In he hopped.

Im Colin, I said.

Frank.

We didnt talk much for the first few miles, aside from me asking if he wanted some of the Fritos I had left from my lunch stop in Rhode Island. He took them and crunched away as I drove. He caught me studying him out of the corner of my eye a few times, but he didnt say anything.

As the miles ticked away and rain started hitting the windshield, Frank fell asleep. The open bag of Fritos was on his lap. I wanted a couple, but didnt want him to wake up thinking I was trying to grab his dick. I had absolutely no interest in his dick.

Frank snored like an orgasming Pratt and Whitney jet engine. In the confines of the car, since I had to close the windows once the rain had started, I noticed Frank had an unpleasant odor. Nothing overwhelming, but still obvious.

Over his snore, his stomach growled and burbled. Gross, I thought. Lightning flashed and wind buffeted the side of the car. The traffic ahead of us slowed to a crawl.

One of the annoying things about my car is the climate control only works properly when the car is moving. God knows why. The air conditioning we were enjoying up to that point cut out, and hot air started to blow out of the vents. The windshield began to fog up.

I cracked my window, hoping the outside air might clear the windshield. It did a bit, but visibility was terrible. The rain was heavy and my wipers werent doing a good job. All I could see was fog and the brake lights of the cars stopped in front of me. Franks stomach kept gurgling. I looked over. He was awake, staring straight ahead.

You okay buddy,? I asked. No response. He just stared at the fog-shrouded glass of the windshield. The smell Id noticed before had intensified.

Hey, Frank, whats going on? You sick?

Still nothing. Thick, humid air poured from the cars vents despite the AC being set to max. Rain and small chunks of hail pelted the choked highway.

Frank retched. Shit, I said, and I frantically reached in the backseat for a bag or bucket or anything that might catch what I thought was about to come blasting out of my companion. My hand settled on one of the canvas shopping bags I used at Whole Foods. God damn it, I mumbled, as I placed my favorite shopping bag on Franks lap.

He moaned and turned to look at me, his eyes swimming back and forth with what I knew had to be intense nausea.

Frank, please open the door and puke on the road or at least use the bag. Im begging you.

More silence punctuated by gurgling and retching. A boom of thunder caused us both to jump. For Frank, that was all it took. He didnt open the door. And he didnt aim for the bag.

A heavy wave of yellow vomit exploded out of his mouth and splashed against the windshield. I screamed. Another projectile torrent erupted from the man, dousing the ceiling, the dashboard, and the center console.

Get out!, I shrieked, the smell of the stomach contents invading my nose and threatening to force my own contribution to the mess. Frank sat back with his head down, pasty slime drooling from his mouth into the Fritos bag in his lap.

Cars behind me were leaning on their horns. The traffic in front of us had cleared. I poked at the hideousness on the console to turn on my emergency blinkers, then steered onto the median. On my right, I heard Frank choking. I got out of the car and stood in the rain, watching him. If you told me the following 30 seconds actually lasted 3 hours, I wouldve told you you were way off. It felt like a day.

Franks throat bulged as something was forced upward and into his mouth. I saw the something a second later. A colossal, writhing centipede as thick as my wrist began sliding out, its passage eased by the vile lubrication from minutes before. Inch after inch, foot after foot crawled out until it was free. It skittered under the passenger seat.

Id already dialed the 9 in 911 when the solid matter entombed in his vomit began to move. Frank groaned and I distinctly heard him mutter, not again. As the rain soaked me, I watched as small centipedes crawled through the sludge all over the car, leaving trails as they went.

My dialing complete, I waited through seven rings before a dispatcher answered. As I told her about the medical emergency and tried to estimate where we were on the interstate, Frank abruptly opened the passenger-side door and stood on the side of the highway. He was gripping another massive centipede and pulling it out of his throat. I watched it bite his hand over and over until its two-foot length was exposed. Frank flung it into the dirt.

Sorry about your car, man, Frank called over the sound of rain and traffic. I havent had an episode since I was a kid.

I was speechless. I just looked at him as he walked down the side of the median, the torrential rain washing his clothes of the filth and bugs. And as centipedes crawled throughout my car and ropes of stomach contents dripped from its ceiling, Frank stuck out his thumb to flag down another potential ride to Baltimore.

<TEXT> []()I bought a house across the street over the summer, and now that the leaves have started to fall, I have a clear view of the graveyard from my living-room window. A week and a half ago, I saw something tall and white moving among the headstones. Something that glowed with dim light, even when it was pitch black out.

I told Denise, who said, and I quote, well thats pretty fuckin cool. We started staying up late to see if it would come back. On Thursday night, it did. Through the binoculars, I could see it was shaped more-or-less like an upside-down tree. It didnt have feet, but rather hundreds of small tendrils that shuffled it through the rows of headstones. Its body was erect and unremarkable, save for an opening at the top where different, longer tendrils hung.

It moved silently and ceaselessly for almost 20 minutes before disappearing into thin air.

When I got to work on Friday, I told a couple guys about it. They said I was full of shit, so I invited them over to see it for themselves. Dan was the only one who took me up on my offer, so I told him to come for dinner. We could eat and wait for the thing to show up.

Around 1am on Saturday morning, it came back. Dan was speechless. He took out his phone and started recording. I told him there was no point; it hadnt shown up on anything Denise and I had tried to record with, but he insisted on trying anyway.

We were out on the front porch, so the thing was about 100 feet away. Maybe more. Dan wasnt having much luck getting it in focus, so he crossed the street and stood on the edge of the cemetery property.

I wouldnt go near it, Dan, Denise advised. Part of me agreed with her, but another part wanted to join him and get a better look.

Its cool, Dan replied over his shoulder. He kept walking in its direction.

I stayed on the porch with Denise and watched Dan get closer.

Can you hear that?, Dan called. It sounds like its singing or something.

Neither of us could hear what Dan heard, but I was growing increasingly uneasy at his cavalier attitude in the face of something completely unknown.

Before any of us could react, one of the tendrils from the top of the creature shot across the cemetery and whipped Dan in the face. He stumbled and fell on his back. Denise gasped and I started running toward my friend. The thing evaporated. I reached Dan, whod already gotten up. He looked no worse for wear.

As we headed back for the house, Dan began to limp. He started to complain about a weird feeling in his feet. I helped him across the street and back into the house. He immediately took off his shoes and started to rub his heels and arches and toes. It was obvious he was in pain.

Without warning, with a series of sickening, wet cracks, Dans feet split in half. He and Denise screamed. They split again. And again. Denise fumbled with her phone to call 911 and I could just watch, horrified, as Dans feet continue to bifurcate until there was nothing left but bleeding tendrils that jerked and twitched, flinging blood across the living room.

Dan passed out as further bifurcations turned his feet into noodle-thin, then hair-thin, filaments. I heard an ambulance approaching. We live only a quarter-mile away from the hospital. The filaments knotted and unknotted as the EMTs entered the house. They gazed, wide-eyed, at Dans injuries.

As they loaded him onto the gurney and began exiting the house, two cracks like gunshots rang out, making everyone jump. His shins, knees, and femurs had split. Blood poured down the sides of the gurney and cascaded down our front steps. Denise and I heard more cracks after the ambulance doors had closed. Then, with sirens blaring, they were gone.

Dan died not long after. I attended his funeral this morning. Theres no explanation for what had happened to him, and the news report on his death simply called it an accident. I want to come forward and tell the police whats going on in the cemetery, but the thing hasnt shown up at all since that night. If anyone else lives in Norwalk and can claim theyd seen something like what I described, please do so. I dont want anyone else to get hurt. Dan didnt deserve what happened to him.

Edit: I asked [Denise](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBakercist) to paint a picture of it. [She got it exactly right.](http://i.imgur.com/31R9pmU.jpg)

<TEXT> In 1987, a plastic surgeon named Harris Wilhelm Tristemon killed his wife, Jill Texana-Tristemon. Harris was never caught, but it was widely assumed it had to have been him. Only Harris had such expertise. Only Harris had such meticulous attention to detail. Only Harris had such devastating psychopathy.

I know.

Im his brother.

I shared with the investigators every incident I remembered from our childhood and adolescence: All the animals Harris had killed. All the classmates he had assaulted. Every punch, every slap, every grope. By late 1989, the investigation had yielded nothing. Harris was gone.

Last month, in the small town of Zermatt, Switzerland, an American expatriate named Jill Pepo was found murdered. While Zermatt is small, crime is not alien to them. Neither is murder, although it is exceedingly rare. That said, the circumstances surrounding Pepos murder were hideous enough for officials to demand silence during the investigation. There was concern the growing immigrant population would be blamed. Despite the lockdown, some details leaked. I found them online. 

Three weeks ago, a Canadian businesswoman, Jill Moschata, was found dead in her hotel room in Dsseldorf. Again, the hideous details were kept bottled up to avoid sparking a xenophobic panic. Again, those details were leaked. 

Again, I found them online. That time, I wasnt the only one.

A few true-crime aficionados had noticed the similarities between the Zermatt and Dsseldorf murders, and one old-timer made the connection between them and the killing of my sister-in-law. The fact the victims were all named Jill was not overlooked.

Once Jill Cucurbita, a Mexican national in upstate New York, was found murdered, all the cases were officially connected. International investigators descended on all the crime scenes. They were looking for evidence to connect my missing brother to the crimes. All they could find were the same wounds. The same cuts. The same disfigurations. 

According to an ICPO and FBI estimation, 11,225 people could have made the same travel arrangements to put them at the scenes of the crimes in Zermatt, Dsseldorf, and New York. That number ballooned to unknown hundreds of thousands if the suspect drove, rather than flew, from Switzerland to Germany. This all meant they had no suspect. No one aside from Harris, who everyone assumed had changed his identity decades ago.

Last Friday, I received a piece of mail containing 13 photographs. There were three from each murder scene. They detailed the incomprehensible brutality of the Jill-killers process. The skinning. The scooping. The carving. The candle burning inside empty, grinning skulls. 

The 13th photograph was of my daughter, whod been named in memory of my beloved sister-in-law. It was a very recent picture, which appeared to have been taken when she was playing in the backyard. Our fenced-in backyard.

All the pictures were given to the FBI, and weve had round-the-clock surveillance of our home ever since. The police presence has done little to allay the fear my wife and I are experiencing. Jill, despite being only four, knows something bad is going on. Something involving her. We cant tell her, though. We cant even hint.

Still, its hard to keep it a secret from our daughter. She sees the police officers outside. She sees the expressions of anxiety on her parents faces. Worst of all, it was she who found the jack-o-lantern that appeared on our kitchen table in the middle of the night. One that was carved with artistic, surgical precision, to look exactly like her.

<TEXT> Grandma would always warn me that the elf on the shelf was watching to make sure I wasnt bad. Growing up, even when it was nowhere near Christmas, the elf would observe me. The elf would judge me.

With my brother and cousins around all the time, it wasnt easy to be good. But I tried. I tried really hard. When Id make a mistake and be mean to one of them, I felt the elf staring at me. It would remember that moment. Id picture it waiting until I was in bed, then running and tattling to Santa. No matter how much I screamed and sobbed to it, the elf wouldnt answer. It would just watch and wait for me to do something bad again. It knew me too well.

On the fourth of July, I burned Marisa with a sparkler. I didnt do it on purpose. I mean, I meant to burn Marisa, but I didnt want to hurt her. I just wanted to see what would happen. Unfortunately, she got hurt pretty bad. Grandma had to take her to the hospital, but not before she got out the belt and whipped me until I couldnt sit down. 

After Marisas mom came over to give me a beating of her own, I was left watching Neil, my little brother. Grandma was still at the hospital. Neil watched TV while I tried to walk off the pain from the beatings. Before Dad died, thats what hed tell me to do. Walk it off, you little faggot. 

I walked a lot. 

When I got to the living room, the elf was watching me. It knew. Its wooden mouth was open, almost like it was screaming accusations. 

Youre a bad kid. 

No one likes you.

Santa thinks youre terrible.

Youll be a bad man when you grow up.

It didnt actually speak, of course, but it was obvious thats what it meant. It was the same stuff Grandma said to me, day in, day out. And somehow, I always made sure to live up to it. Try as I might, I couldnt be good. At the age of eight, I was already certain I was rotten to the core. 

Months went by and my best efforts yielded punishment. If I wasnt accidentally knocking over a vase in the kitchen, I was tracking mud into the hallway. It invariably ended with my pants around my ankles and my grandfathers old leather belt smashing into me as I tried not to scream. Screaming would only make the beatings last longer. 

When it was finally over and I inched my jeans and underwear back up, I told myself Id be better; that Id be a good kid from here on out. And for a while - for the entire month of November and into December - I was.

Grandma, Neil, and I went to get our Christmas tree on December 4th. We came home and decorated it while cookies baked in the oven. I remember Grandma lifting me with her strong, solid arms so I could put the star on top. The star had been her daughters. My mothers. It was one of the only things left that had belonged to her.

On December 5th, after Neil and I had gotten home from school, we were playing around. Like all brothers, we played rough. With him being six and me being eight, I was quite a bit bigger. When we were wrestling and I was spinning him by his arm, I made a mistake. I let him go and send him right into the Christmas tree. It fell onto the hardwood floor. Ornaments broke. Lights went out.

The star shattered.

In an instant, I was panicking. I knew Neil would tell Grandma. I knew the elf in the other room would learn what Id done. Id been good for so long that Id started hoping I might get Christmas presents. After this, though; after breaking the one thing Grandma had left after her daughter was killed by Dad, Id be doomed. Grandma would beat me senseless. The elf would tell Santa. Id get nothing. And Neil would taunt me with his presents.

Something sparked inside me. What if the elf hadnt seen what happened? What if Neil didnt tell Grandma? 

I was very busy for about an hour. By the time I was done, Grandma would be back from work any minute. I knew I might not fool her, but Id fool the elf. That was most important; it was he who talked to Santa. Not Grandma.

I wore Neils face into the living room and looked at the elf on the shelf. He stared back with his blue, judgmental eyes. 

Im sorry I knocked over the tree and broke the ornament, I said, doing my best impression of Neils high voice. I thought about his body cooling on the kitchen floor and his blood making a mess everywhere. Maybe Grandma would believe he fell on a knife if I cried hard enough.

Under the mask of my brothers skin, I peered at the elf through the eye holes. The skin tasted awful, but I had to breathe through my mouth because the nose holes line up right. I wondered if the elf believed me.

Im sorry, elf, I squeaked again. I heard the garage door rising and a car pulling inside. Grandma was home. I felt a new rush of panic. I glared through the cold mask at the arbiter of my Christmas fortune. The door connecting the garage to the kitchen opened and I heard my grandmothers shrill, hysterical shriek.

Elf, I whispered, as tears mixed with my brothers blood and cascaded down my face.

The elf on the shelf turned its head 360 degrees as its mouth opened and closed. When it faced me again, it spoke: Youve been very bad, Neil.

I fell to my knees in fervid, incomprehensible relief. Some part of me heard Grandma still screaming, somehow even louder when she came into the room and saw me. Again, the elf spoke, Youve been terrible Neil. 

Grandma whirled around and looked at the elf, but then shook her head back and forth like she was trying to get ahold of herself. I stood up. Not wanting to ruin the illusion for the elf, I held the mask to my face until I left the room and sat down in the kitchen. Grandma didnt try to hit me. She didnt touch me at all. I piled the skin back on Neils head and told Grandma he fell. She didnt answer. 

It didnt matter, though.

20 days later, in my own, warm room at the hospital, I got some very nice Christmas presents. The doctors and nurses were so kind and gentle with me. One even hugged me after Id opened my gifts. The gifts werent exactly what Id hoped for, but they were better than nothing. So much better. I giggled to myself as we hugged. When the nurse asked what I was laughing at, I lied and told her I remembered a funny joke. She smiled, and I was surprised to see a tear running down her cheek. I didnt think much of it, though. All that mattered was Id won. Id finally fooled the elf on the shelf.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is going to get swept under the rug because of the Hurricane Matthew coverage. Even if it isnt, whatevers mentioned in the news will be sanitized for public consumption. People arent supposed to hear about this kind of thing  especially when you consider how frightened they are already.

Theres a daycare in Charleston, SC. Its in an awful neighborhood. I was patrolling the area before dawn this morning when the owner ran out in the street and flagged me down. She was covered in blood. I got out of the car and called for backup. Officers Fitzgerald and Ndoma were a block away and got there a minute later. Ndoma stayed with the inconsolable, trembling owner while Fitz and I drew our weapons and entered the building.

There were six children inside. Unclothed. Dead.

I called for paramedics and a supervisor. Amid the chaos of hurricane preparations, by the time theyd arrived, Fitz and I had cleared the small building. If the owner of the daycare hadnt killed the kids, whoever had was gone.

The news media, who wouldve been all over something like this, hadnt even noticed our radio chatter. They were too busy reporting on the storm. To be honest, I couldnt have been more relieved. The city didnt need to know about this yet.

The daycare owner still hasnt said a word. We have her in custody and its obvious she needs a psychiatric evaluation, but thats off the table until at least tomorrow. We pulled the records of the children from the daycare files and are beginning to notify parents. The last two of the six bodies are being examined as I write this.

The hospital is being prepared for an influx of storm-related injuries, so the deceased were brought directly to the city coroner. The examinations are cursory and unofficial. I know the main guy down there. My father was the best man at his wedding. Whenever I wanted to know something about a case that was above my paygrade, hed usually fill me in. Today was no different. I know what I saw, but were a lot of unanswered questions.

When Fitz and I entered the building and saw the victims, we knew the cause of death right away. The wounds were gaping and obvious. In fact, I dont think Ive blinked today without seeing them in that split second of darkness. To me, it was clear the owner couldnt have done it. Shes 51, and if you told me she was 90 pounds, Id be surprised. Her mouths small, too. Yes, thats relevant.  

Heres the thing: at first glance, I assumed the kids had to have been killed by some kind of animal. The bites which prompted the massive blood loss mustve come from something with large, powerful jaws. After we cleared the building, though, and Fitz was outside with Ndoma trying to get the owner to say what happened, I took a closer look at the wounds. They were too uniform. Too precise.

What I mean by that is the children were all bitten in the same spot. Everything between their legs, from navel to lower back, was gone. There were smudges on their thighs. Something white. It more obvious on the darker-skinned victims, but nonetheless present on all of them. I was about to examine the fibers I saw sticking to the wounds, but I was interrupted by the paramedics and the coroners office. They needed to do their thing, so I left them to it.

Ive spent the whole morning at my desk, filling out reports, and writing this account to help clear my mind. About an hour ago, I called my contact at the coroners office. He told me, like I mentioned above, that theyd looked over four of the six. It was, certainly, the bites which had killed them. They bled out in a matter of seconds.

I asked him what he thought could have done it, and he paused. To me, that meant he still didnt know for sure. After a few seconds of silence, I asked about the fibers Id seen.

Red hairs, he told me. Wiry, red hairs. John thought they couldve been from a chimpanzee, since theyve been known to attack the genital area, but they usually do damage to other places too.

What about the white stuff?, I asked.

Were not sure yet. The lab will have to do an analysis after the storm, but from what everyone over here can determine, its some kind of makeup.

I thanked him and was about to hang up, but he told me to hold on.

Theres one more thing. Something we found stuffed up around what was left of the caucasian boys bladder.

I shuddered, but told him to continue.

Well, its foam. When we pulled it out, it was just kind of a blobby thing. But then John washed it off.

My friend trailed off and I heard him sighing deeply into the phones receiver. I gave him a second, but urged him on. He sighed again.

Max, it was one of those red foam noses. The same ones clowns wear.

<TITLE> Ethan's Halloween Mask </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My cousin Ethan and I grew up together, but I never liked him very much. His family was rich, so he always had the best stuff. Mine wasnt. I didnt.

On Halloween, 1985, we were going trick-or-treating together. I was the Terminator, he was Freddy Krueger. His mask cost almost a hundred dollars and it looked exactly like Freddys face. The scars, the sneer; everything was just right.

I didnt have a mask. My parents couldnt afford one. I had torn aluminum foil taped to the side of my face. It was meant to look like the Terminator after some of its skin had been ripped off. A few splotches of ketchup on the foil were supposed to look like blood. As soon as it dried, it looked very little like dried blood and very much like dried ketchup.

Despite my terrible costume, I was still excited to trick-or-treat. We didnt have candy very often at home, except maybe on Easter. My parents encouraged me to go to as many houses as I wanted to get all the candy Id be able to eat. It felt good to know they wanted me to be happy.

Ethan and I went out at sundown and visited house after house. Every time, the homeowners would gush over Ethans mask. Theyd tell him how scary it was. How realistic. Then theyd turn to me and ask who I was supposed to be. Id answer, then theyd say something like, oh of course, how could I have missed it! I could tell they felt sorry for me. One even handed me an extra few pieces of candy.

When we were done, our pillowcases stuffed with treats of every sort, we began the long walk home. As we went, Ethan rooted around in his bag of loot. I could hear him grumbling and complaining through his mask. Then he started throwing candy on the street. Stuff he didnt like.

Go ahead and pick it up if you want it, Bill, he called out, heaving handful after handful into the gutter. I know you cant afford to let anything go to waste.

I didnt say anything, but I reached into my pocket and pulled out the lighter and one of the two cigarettes Id stolen from my dad. Id been smoking on-and-off for the last few months, and even at 13, I knew it was bad for me. I just didnt care. It made me feel good.

I stayed a few steps behind Ethan as he tossed more candy away, and as much as I hated myself for it, I ended up picking a few pieces off the ground and putting them in my bag. Ethan caught me once and laughed. Youre going to be as fat as your mom if you eat all that. I kept my mouth shut.

Is that why she got fired from the restaurant? Did she eat a customers food?

I knew Ethan was joking. He did it often. Im sure in his mind, he thought he was being harmless and playful. Still, Id told him more than a few times to leave Mom out of the jokes. She had diabetes. And she hadnt mentioned it to anyone other than my dad and me, but the doctor told her she might end up losing her foot. Thats why the restaurant let her go. She couldnt walk around and wait tables anymore.

Change the subject, Ethan, I said. I knew he heard me, and he didnt talk for another minute or so. Until he did again.

You think her and your dad still fuck? I wonder how he manages to get it in there. He cackled, then insisted, ok, ok, ok, Im sorry, Im done. Promise.

I seethed as we took a shortcut through the elementary school soccer field.

Lets stop here for a minute, Ethan said. Wed gotten to the schools playground. I bet I could scare the shit out of some kids if they come by.

He sat on one of the swings with his pillowcase on his lap. He kicked his legs and the swing moved back and forth. I stood there, hating him.

I think I see some kids coming over the hill, I told Ethan. Im going to hide behind the slide and sneak up on them if they come over to you.

Go for it, Ethan told me, his voice deep and distorted through the mask.

I left Ethan on the swing set and walked over to the slide. I watched him swing as his hateful words rang in my ears. Tears came to my eyes as I remembered Mom smiling from her spot on the couch as she encouraged me to go out and have fun. She was such a good person. So, so good. Shed never said anything negative about Ethan. In fact, shed always complimented him on his grades and his wins in basketball and even his looks. Youre going to be a handsome man, Ethan, she told him. I bet well see your face in a magazine someday.

Even after her kindnesses, Ethan still felt it was okay to trash her.

I heard him laughing to himself from across the playground. I didnt know why, exactly, but I had a pretty good idea. I reached in my jacket for the other cigarette, knowing the smoke would calm me down. But it had come apart. My pocket was full of loose tobacco and paper. Loose tobacco, paper, and the lighter.

Ethan was still laughing as I fingered the lighter in my pocket for a second, then pulled it out. I walked up behind him. He didnt know I was there as he shouted out, ok, one more thing and Ill never say anything about her again - but unless your dads got a big dick, hell never manage to --

I flicked the lighter near the back of Ethans neck, right where his hair and mask met. The hair went up quickly, using his hairspray as an accelerant. Then something happened that I didnt expect. The mask burst into flames.

Ethan jumped off the swing and ran in a loose circle, trying to pull the mask off his head. I saw it ripping under his fingers. He couldnt get a grip. The material bubbled. His screams, barely muffled as the molten chemicals clung to his skin, echoed off the brick walls of the elementary school.

After a few seconds, he fell and rolled around on playground, pushing his head into the sand to put out the fire. And he succeeded. But the damage was done.

He turned over on his back, no longer screaming, but gasping in shallow, hyperventilated breaths. In the moonlight, I saw the mask was completely fused to what remained of his skin. One of his eyes had apparently burst, but his other darted around almost like he was confused and wondering where he was.

I saw something moving on the other side of the field. Kids were coming. I yelled to them to call an ambulance, and I waited, unsure of how I felt, until the paramedics got there.

I took complete responsibility for setting Ethan on fire. I said Id been sneaking up to scare him by flicking the lighter near his face. And yes, I got in a lot of trouble. But everyone believed it was an accident.

Ethans face was destroyed. He had skin grafts and bone grafts and all sorts of reconstructive surgery. He never recovered. Not physically, not emotionally. He killed himself in 1990. His parents held a very expensive funeral. I was invited. Theyd forgiven me for my part in his accident years before. In fact, their subsequent lawsuit against the mask company is the reason why Halloween masks are now made of flame-retardant materials.

Mom died a few years before Ethan, but not before complications from her diabetes took her left leg. Dad and I were with her in the hospital at the same time Ethans parents were there to see him through another round of reconstructive surgery. They visited Mom, Dad, and I while Ethan was still under, recovering after a successful set of grafts.

We chatted for a little while about Moms hopes for recovery, and then the topic moved to Ethan. Ethans mom was gushing about a plastic surgeon that had recently joined the hospital after working in Switzerland. He was the best, apparently. Hed taken on Ethans case earlier in the year, albeit remotely, and wrote a substantial article about the new techniques hed be employing. In the world of plastic surgery, it made a big splash, if only for its ambition.

Ethans mom reached into her purse and pulled out the publication. She flipped it open to the page that showed various photographs of Ethans burns and the notes and explanations the surgeon had written to accompany the article. I could tell Mom was holding back tears. I knew why, too. Her eyes met mine, and she couldnt hold back any longer. She began to weep. Dad and Ethans mother held her while she cried. I just watched.

Mom was thinking that shed been right all those years ago. Shed been right for all the wrong reasons, but right nonetheless. Just like shed predicted, Ethans face had finally made it into a magazine.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My uncle worked for the State Department. He died a couple weeks ago. As per State Department policy, whenever one of their higher-ranking employees dies, the Department sends a small team to the home of the deceased to ensure they had no sensitive documents in their possession. Its not that they distrust their dead colleague - they just dont trust his family.

The Department team came to my uncles house one morning, spent a few hours rifling through his closets and drawers, and left with a small pile of papers. They expressed their condolences for my loss, then left. I never saw them again. Not even at the funeral.

On the night I visited and found him on the floor, dying of a heart attack, he told me something. Its something I wouldve preferred to have never heard; something that made me wish Id gotten to his house 20 minutes later to find him dead. 

Rockville Bank. Rangeley, ME. Deposit box 4426. The key was on the ring between his car and house keys.

I pocketed the key before the paramedics arrived. He was dead by then. I went through the motions, arranged what needed to be arranged, and let the State Department do their thing. Last week, I drove from DC up to Rangely. I showed the bank the documents proving I was in charge of my uncles estate and owner of the contents of the box. The bank manager unlocked the main lock on top, then left me to unlock the other one on the bottom. Inside was an envelope containing a single sheet of paper dated August 4, 2016, that looked like it had been pulled out of a fire. I took it from the box, left the bank, and read it in my car.

I have to preface this by saying Ive never been one for conspiracy theories. In fact, I think theyre all a bunch of bullshit. We landed on the moon. Oswald killed Kennedy. Islamic terrorists brought down the twin towers. Vaccines are safe and important. None of the major conspiracy theories have been able to hold up under scrutiny, and all the exponents of the theories are, in one way or another, unhinged. But.

But.

Theres nothing inside me that can adequately explain away what I read on that sheet of paper. Yes, it might be a hoax. During the long drive back to DC, Id almost convinced myself that it was. But my uncle wouldnt do something like that. He took his work seriously. He was passionate and moral. All the evidence pointed to the fact the document was real. And if that were the case, people needed to know about it. That had to have been why my uncle had hidden the file away. He wanted me, or someone else, to disseminate it after his death. I made up my mind, and when I got home, I submitted it to Wikileaks.

Five minutes later, I received a phone call. Destroy the scan you sent us. It is not real. Destroy the file and the physical document. Do not attempt to submit it again. We know who you are.

I hadnt provided any personal information to Wikileaks. They dont even ask for it. And hardly anyone has my phone number. Plus, no one else knew I had that document in my possession. 

If anything could have proven the document was authentic and important, that was it.

That all happened last Friday. Every day since then, Ive gotten calls from different numbers, all asking the same questions. Is it gone? Is it destroyed?

Each time, I hung up without saying anything. This morning, though, the voice on the other end said something different. You will die if that document is leaked.

I hung up and called the police, who said they would send a car over. But Im still worried. I am going to destroy the document, but not before I transcribe it. Not before I put it online. Even if they get me - even if they kill me - Im not sure I want to continue living in a world where the contents of that document are real.

Ive replaced the burn marks with dashes. The content is still discernible. The context is still available. Whatever happens with this, once its out in the open, my conscience can be clear. If this is my last day alive, maybe Ill be rewarded for bringing this to light. God knows if I live through today, I may never sleep again.

<TITLE> The Empty Cribs on Hawthorn Lane </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-04 20:35:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The bloody pacifier I found hanging from my tree belonged to Alyssa Harris, who went missing from her crib two nights ago. I figured it had to have been Alyssas when I saw it, but while I waited for the police to arrive, I realized it couldve belonged to Matthew Roman. Or Muhammad Ahad. Or maybe even Hailey Davis. Over the last four years, theyd all vanished.

Hawthorn Lane developed quite a bit of notoriety in 2015 after Matthew and Muhammad disappeared on the same night. The Romans and the Ahads lived four houses apart, and as far as the detectives were able to tell, the infants were abducted within minutes of each other. Both houses were securely locked and there was no sign of a forced entry.

As far as Im concerned, though, the notoriety and rush of attention from the national news wouldnt have happened if their disappearance hadnt been on the anniversary of the 2012 abduction of Hailey Davis. 

Haileys case was special, if it could be called such a thing. Thats because on October 1st, 2013, exactly a year after she went missing, pieces of her were found stuffed in the mailboxes of every family on the street who had, or were expecting, children. A swarm of investigators, both local and federal, descended on our quiet, suburban lane, and worked around the clock for months before admitting defeat. There was no evidence. 

No fingerprints. No hairs. No mysterious DNA.

When the media came to town in 2015 after Matthew and Muhammad went missing, the rumors started. Rumors and threats. People from all over the country decided to get involved. They felt it was their duty. They began sending harassing letters and making threatening phone calls to the single adults who lived on Hawthorn Lane. These were people whod lived here for years; people who had grieved alongside the parents and families whod lost their children. But that didnt matter to the crazies, whod been thoroughly brainwashed by cable news into believing the abductor had to be someone from the neighborhood.

In December of 2015, a Georgia man named Alvin Stovall drove 300 miles up the coast, parked in front of Jose Partidas house, and shot him to death when he came home from work. Alvin was certain Jose was the murderer of Hailey Davis and the abductor of Matthew Roman and Muhammad Ahad. Hed heard from a cable news anchor that Jose had a criminal record. That, as well as Joses name, was all Alvin needed to justify his action. 

What the anchor had neglected to mention was Joses record was from 1977. And it was for nothing worse than being a passenger in a stolen car. Jose did his three months, got out on his 22nd birthday, and had been a model citizen ever since. He was my friend.

After Joses murder, the local police were ordered to keep a tight lid on any information pertaining to the disappearances. When Alyssa Harris was reported missing two days ago, it was printed on page four of the local newspaper. So far, there hadnt been anyone from the major media outlets poking around. I know its only a matter of time, though. Yesterday morning, someone who looked like a reporter was tailing the police cars when they came to investigate the bloody pacifier. For the rest of the day, my phone rang and rang. When I answered, whoever was on the other line just hung up.

That alone was enough to make me worried. My name is Luis Goncalves. Ive been on Hawthorn Lane for 40 years. Ive lived by myself since Robert passed away in 1999. Jose Partida was my next-door neighbor. While I appreciate the efforts of our law enforcement officials, they werent able to stop Alvin Stovall from murdering my friend. They arent able to stop whoever is taking the neighborhood children. Ive resorted to keeping my pistol holstered to my side all day, every day; even in my house.

I know that may sound paranoid, but look at it from my perspective. Someone is abducting and killing children on my street. An innocent man was gunned down because the news media has convinced a large group of people that Latinos are dangerous criminals. And yesterday morning, hanging from a small branch on a tree in my front yard, was a pacifier dripping with a childs blood. I cant take my chances.

All that said, theres one more thing. Im reluctant to talk about it, because its something I saw when I was experiencing a dizzy spell from my blood pressure medication. Id blacked out from the medication before, so this couldve been nothing but a hallucination. Still, these days, with everything thats going on, I think it bears mentioning.

Last night, I was washing up after a midnight snack. The sink is in front of a picture window that overlooks the front yard. Since it was dark out, I couldnt see anything but the reflection of myself and the kitchen behind me. I was already feeling dizzy from my medication, but it wasnt severe enough for me to have to sit, so I kept cleaning. 

As I washed the last dish, the overhead light blew. The kitchen went dark. It took a moment for my eyes to acclimate, but I could soon see the neighborhood outside. And there was something across the street, opening the Richter familys mailbox. 

A wave of dizziness went through me and I gripped the edge of the counter to steady myself, but Im certain what I saw was really there. It was a pale, nude man with freakishly long legs and even longer arms that protruded from his hips, rather than his shoulders. Despite him being bent down, it was obvious he was tall enough to peer through a second-story window. 

He paused with the mailbox half open, then abruptly stepped away and turned around. In two, long strides, he crossed the street into my yard. He gazed through my kitchen window with large, gray eyes. I stared back. A toothless mouth opened, stretching wide enough to fit a basketball. I reached for my pistol. Through the glass, I heard the sound of infants screaming from deep inside his throat. His mouth shut, then twisted into a grin. Then his long, spindly legs carried him away, down the street, and into the woods.

<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4q5n77/in_our_quest_to_drill_for_more_and_more_oil_i/)

The following hours passed in a blur of frantic calls to corporate, systems checks, and a near riot when the divers refused to collect the rapidly-dispersing grease slick that used to be John Edmundson. 

The tension broke when Gervaso Zaragoza, whose headache had returned with a vengeance, grabbed a wrench that weighed almost as much as he did, hoisted it over his head like he was going to hit someone, and then toppled backward and fell on his ass. Its amazing how the humor of someone falling down can diffuse a volatile situation. After a few minutes, the divers stopped complaining and did their part while the rest of the crew shut up and went back to work.

I hadnt told anyone what Id seen in the water. As far as corporate was concerned, a catastrophic failure in the hydraulics system was what had pulped their employee. Yes, people with knowledge of the systems involved would be able to dispute it, but at the moment, which was what mattered, no one did. Id be able to talk with corporate later in the week, once I knew what was going on, and theyd appreciate me keeping it from the rest of the crew. A plausible lie is always better than a disruptive truth. 

During the commotion, when I was trying to get everyone to calm down, the tentacles, or whatever they were, had fallen back to the floor of the plain. They sat in straight lines at the bottom. I dumped all the data showing their movement to a pair of USB sticks, pocketed them, and purged the storage array of the evidence.

For the rest of the day, I sat at the console and did my best to work without interruption. While the calls to and from corporate had slowed, every 45-or-so minutes, Id be forced to respond to another board members secretary asking the same questions Id already answered a dozen times. Thankfully, as the day came to an end, even those calls died down. It was quiet.

My direct supervisors left via helicopter in the early evening. I was in charge for the weekend. It wasnt a new experience; the upper management of the platform had the freedom to go back to the mainland and visit their families a few times a month, and they did so as frequently as possible. I was used to being in charge. In fact, I enjoyed not having anyone breathing down my neck.

In the morning, more of the crew were reporting headaches. Gervaso was not one of them. He said he felt a lot better, and even volunteered to take the shifts of a few of his colleagues who were under the weather. His supervisor, Quan Williams, who felt like shit, told him to do whatever he wanted. I found out about that much later.

Id been busy since early in the morning, working remotely from my dorm, and using my laptop to control one of the drones. I was studying the tentacles. Overnight, one had moved. Not much, but enough to warrant my investigation - especially because it was touching one of the platforms support beams.

To make matters worse, the bottom was exceptionally murky. Sediment was floating in a thick cloud. Visibility was awful. While I could see the tentacle touching the platform through a visual/sonar composite, the resolution was low. It was obvious there was movement on the floor of the plain, but its source was invisible. Part of me was certain something was being intentionally hidden. 

Around noon, Anand, the head medic, knocked on my door. I met him in the hallway. He informed me that 34 of the 66 crew members were sick with debilitating headaches. I told him to keep me abreast of what was going on, and if anyone took a turn for a worse, to keep it quiet and come to me immediately. He nodded. I think he understood the importance of avoiding another commotion. 

I didnt have to wait long. Anand came back at 2pm. He looked upset. When I asked whod gotten worse, he looked around, then put his finger to his lips, shushing me. I nodded and he beckoned me to follow him. I did.

We traversed the labyrinthine staircases of the platform. We were heading toward the mechanical room. I hated the mechanical room.

The mechanical room was where all the heaviest equipment was located. It was always loud, always filthy, and always dangerous. Pumps and engines rattled and expelled noxious fumes while hydraulic cables transported fluids under pressures so high that a leak no wider than a human hair could cut a man in half. The crew who worked down there were a mixture of brave and insane. Theyd been putting in double time over the last few weeks as they tested and prepared the platform to begin its main drilling cycle.

Anand and I reached the room and found five crewmembers being kept at bay by their supervisor, Karen Vant. When they saw me, they started asking questions - all relating to Gervaso Zaragoza, whod volunteered to work there for the day, and Frank Panagakos. Id never met Frank before, but I knew he was one of the newer mechanics on the platform. Karen told her guys to shut up and let us through. To their credit, they did.

Karen, Anand, and I walked down the main corridor between two massive generators. Karen told us how all the holes in the platform from the accident with Edmundson had been patched. All but one. The one we were coming up on. 

The mechanical room was essentially the basement of the platform. Below it was nothing but pipes, cables, and water. I saw the hole ahead of us. As we got closer, I saw there was something coming out of it. Something bright red and glinting in the harsh, overhead fluorescent light. My breath caught in my throat.

We approached the hole. A hundred feet below, greenish-gray waves heaved against one another. I got on my knees and peered down, making sure not to touch the thing coming out. On the northern support beam, a thin line of red rose out of the Gulf, all the way to the underside of the platform and over to the hole. Once inside, it stretched down the corridor. Karen asked me if I had any idea what it was. I lied and told her I had no idea. Anand urged us forward, and we continued down the corridor, following the red tube.

We turned corners and ducked under cables and piping until we reached one of the hottest, noisiest, and filthiest corners of the room. Gervaso was there, facing Frank. They stood, motionless and open mouthed, staring at one another as we walked toward them. They didnt move or acknowledge our approach.

The closer we got, it became obvious something was very, very wrong with them. The red thing had grown up Gervasos leg and chest and appeared to have entered his face under his chin. But that was the least disconcerting part. 

The light was dim over here; blocked by the piping and machinery. I had to get in close to see exactly what was happening. Karen produced a flashlight without my knowledge and as soon as I was within a foot of their faces, she flicked on the light. I gasped.

Gervaso and Frank were joined by thin, red veins. They appeared to have sprouted from Gervasos eyes, and they entered Franks face at various spots in his mouth, eyes, and forehead. They trembled slightly, almost like they were shivering. As I watched, another cilia-like vein pushed from the center of Gervasos eye and twirled outward, searching for purchase, before settling on Franks temple and slipping inside.

What is it?, Karen asked. I looked at Anand. He shook his head. A string of drool oozed out of Franks mouth.

We cant leave them here, Anand said. They need to get to a hospital.

Can we move them?, I asked.

I dont know, Anand told me. They might move on their own if we ask.

Gervaso, estas bien?, I asked. He didnt answer. He didnt move. Frank? Nothing.

I took the flashlight from Karen and touched it to the veins. They stretched under the pressure, but didnt react. I pressed harder.

Maybe you shouldnt -- started Anand, but Id already pressed hard enough to detach one of the veins from under Franks tongue. Frank exhaled heavily and his left eye turned to look at me. Before any of us could react, the entire platform shook. 

What the fuck was that?, Anand practically shouted.

I have no idea, Karen answered, wide eyed. It felt like something just crashed into one of the support beams.

**Will be concluded.**

<TITLE> Theres something dangerous living near the power plant in Bridgeport, CT. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I dont know if any of you are familiar with the area, but the people who live over here have been talking about it for the last couple weeks. No one can agree on what it is, but the one thing they know is a lot of pets have gone missing. Birds, too. The power plants on Long Island Sound, and there used to be seagulls and herons all over the place. Not anymore.

The Connecticut Posts main office is only a few blocks away on State Street, but they havent published stories about anything out of the ordinary. Same with News 12. That doesnt mean they havent heard rumors, though. A guy I work with, Dion Hargrove, called up the Post last week to tell them about something he saw over by the old Remington building.

The Remington building is right across from a walking park that runs parallel to the University of Bridgeport campus. The parks beautiful during the day, but at night, like the rest of the area, its sketchy as all hell. If what Dion saw was after dark, he wouldnt have thought much of it. He wouldnt have stayed to watch. But at 11am on a sunny day, he knew what he was seeing was very out of place.

While Dion walked, he noticed a person crouching by the front door of the Remington building. He wasnt too close, but it was a clear shot across the street through the chainlink fence. The person was wearing a heavy, green NY Jets coat, despite it being almost 80 degrees out and humid. In his hands was a cat. And he was eating it. Now, Bridgeport has its share of homeless people, many of whom are mentally ill. If you remember that story from Florida about the homeless guy who ate his friends face, well, he was originally from Bridgeport. But I digress.

As Dion watched, the guy buried his face into the poor cats belly and gnawed away. Then he looked up and saw Dion watching him. He dropped the cat and ran, but not before Dion could see something was very wrong with him. First off, he looked extremely overweight. That alone isnt worthy of mention, of course, but there was something deeply unsettling about his bulk. It shifted under the heavy coat as he ran, but not with his steps. It moved on its own.

Right before the man turned the corner into the rear of the building, something fell from his coat. It was like a reddish-gray slab of skin. It trailed behind him as he turned, but then lifted on its own and disappeared behind the building.

Dion didnt know what the hell hed just seen, but he figured he probably had to call the cops. Bridgeport cops have an unpleasant reputation, but considering the guy was so close to the University, Dion was worried the he might try to hurt a student. The cops came and took his statement, but he never heard anything back. His call didnt show up in the Posts police log.

Dions report is the most detailed, but its not the only one. Not by a long shot. Boaters in Long Island Sound have complained about their motors getting snagged and ruined as they passed by the power plant. Nearby residents, aside from losing their pets, have made noise complaints about a low, screaming howl coming primarily from the area surrounding the plant, but sometimes as close as the street outside. And then theres David Chung.

David was a student at the University of Bridgeport. Hed just moved into his dorm in August, and the security cameras showed him walking around the campus and heading off down the street to the beach.

The next morning, Davids body was found in the water near the power plants dock. There was a brief investigation, and it was determined he drowned while swimming and the damage to his body was the result of being struck by a barge delivering coal to the plant.

My friend in the police department, though, told me hed seen floaters hit by those barges. David didnt look anything them. To make matters worse, the official report didnt mention the kids wounds. The holes. Holes all over his body that looked like theyd been sucked out, rather than punctured. And the report also neglected to mention the fact that David had been found wrapped in a heavy, green, NY Jets coat. The same one Dion Hargrove had described to the police.

To anyone who thinks this warrants more of an investigation, I implore you to spread this around. I want people to see whats happening here and not let the violence get swept under the rug like in every other urban community. Because I know something very wrong is living near that power plant. Something thats now moved on from birds and cats to people. And every night, as I shiver behind locked doors with my rifle, I can hear it howling.

<TITLE> Today is the last day of my "no body horror for a month" experiment. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-30 14:32:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> All in all, I'd say it was really successful. I posted 15 stories (~~probably~~ 16 by the time today comes to a close), and most of them did pretty well.

The ones that performed below average, according only to upvotes, not how I feel about their quality, did so mostly because they were on the fringe of what NoSleep allows (and a big thank you to the mods for giving them the benefit of the doubt).

It felt good to get out of my comfort zone. Even though the months before September didn't feature *that much* body horror, it was still absolutely a crutch I used on days when I couldn't figure out what to write. 

Forcing myself away from that whole sub-genre and still keeping my output at the level I've grown to demand definitely stressed my creativity, but I'm better for having done so. I'd recommend it to anyone struggling to get out of a rut.

All that said, I can't wait for you guys to see the disgusting and depraved stuff I have in mind for October.

<TEXT> I was torn from my sleep by the sound of my daughters screams. I rushed across the hall and saw Jessie standing in front of her bedroom window. When I wrapped my arms around her, I noticed her pajamas were soaked with sweat. The screams tapered off and gasping sobs replaced them; her tiny body heaving as it attempted to take in more air than her lungs would allow.

I picked her up and carried her into my room. We sat on the bed and I held her until shed calmed enough for me to ask what happened. She shook her head. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks.

Please, sweetheart - I promise its okay. What happened?

Jessies wide, blue eyes stared into mine, still leaking away the memory of whatever trauma shed endured. She pulled my nightgown, beckoning me to come down to her level so she could whisper something in my ear. I obliged.

There was a big girl in my window making faces at me.

I lifted my head again to look at Jessie, still feeling the hot condensation from her breath in my ear.

A big girl?, I asked, puzzled. Jessie nodded and wiped her eyes on her sweaty pajamas.

Come on, I told her, forcing a smile. Lets get you in the tub. Ill let you use my bath bomb. 

For the first time since the ordeal began, a smile flashed across her face. Finally.

As we waited for the tub to fill, Jessie held me around my waist. Her crying had stopped, but she still trembled. I stroked her hair and told her it was okay, over and over, while wondering what could have possibly scared her so badly. This type of episode was entirely unlike her. Quite the contrary; Id always walk in on her sneaking peeks of scary movies on TV even though Id told her, in no uncertain terms, that she wasnt to watch them. But still, even though shed seen some creepy monsters and murderers, theyd never given her nightmares.

When the tub was filled and the bath bomb was releasing bubbles and glitter and scents that delighted and relaxed Jessie, I helped her out of her pajamas and into the water. She sat there peacefully as her tiredness caught up with her again. Her eyes closed. I continued stroking her hair.

After a little while, knowing she needed to go back to bed, I shook her awake. She opened her eyes and saw me, prompting a smile. But then she stiffened, her eyes widening, and screamed again. I reached into the tub and grabbed her, trying to hold her close, but she pushed and clawed at me, trying to get away.

I cried out to her, Jessie, what is hap -- and I stopped. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something behind me. Something at the window.

I whirled around, yanking Jessie against my back as I shielded her from something I hadnt even properly seen. But soon I had. And my own panicked shriek drowned out that of my daughter.

Peering in through the bathroom window was a round, wide face. Pale white with small, jaundiced eyes, it pushed against the window screen until it fell out and clattered on the floor. The face moved toward us on a dowel-thin, articulated neck connected directly to its chin.

Get out!, I shouted, mustering up as much violence in my voice as possible. 

The neck was blocking our path to the door, and the hideous face turned and stared directly at me before opening its mouth and saying one word: Jessie.

A paralyzing wave of incomprehensible terror bloomed inside me. The voice was low and droning, like a normal womans voice slowed and pitched down an octave. I felt Jessie stiffen against my back and she pressed her face against my spine, as if trying to hide inside me.

More neck came through the window, the vertebrae bulging against its tight skin as it swayed in the space around us like a long finger with a hundred knuckles. 

Jess...ie. The voice was even deeper now; I felt it in my chest and bowels.

The face moved toward me and I struck it with my fist. My hand thudded uselessly against its forehead. Before my eyes, the face began to change. Its features elongated, then contracted. Its mouth stretched to its earlobes, then shrank down to a pinhole. The entire topography of its cheekbones and chin and jaw shattered, then reformed. A second later, I was looking at a terribly deformed version of my daughter.

Jessie. It exhaled heavily. Hot, stinking breath filled my nostrils.

The strength in my arms vanished. The stability in my legs evaporated. I dropped to the floor, helpless. Jessie was exposed.

Jess...ie. The serpentine neck wrapped around my daughter and pulled her toward the window. Jessie, no longer screaming, struggled to breathe against its constricting grasp. Her face reddened. The terrible thing drooled black fluid onto the top of her head. Jessie went limp. She, and the creature, disappeared into the night.

My body regained its strength and I bolted to the window. In the dim light of the crescent moon, I watched the long legs of the thing carry my daughter away into the woods.

I called 911. The police came. They investigated for days. I was the only suspect in her disappearance, but as days turned into weeks and weeks stretched into months, the trail had gone cold. Even if I was still a suspect, they had nothing to even hint at me being the reason for her disappearance. And, in fact, there was evidence to the contrary.

During the initial investigation, when every nook and cranny of the house was looked at, when every piece of furniture was upended, and when every inch of the property was examined, there were only two pieces of evidence; neither of which had anything to do with me, other than to help corroborate my story.

The first morning of the investigation, officers noticed a trail of glitter from the bath bomb stretching from the bathroom window all the way through the yard and high into the trees at the mouth of the forest. When an officer scaled one of the trees, he found glitter stuck to leaves 25 feet up. It was strange, they admitted, but in their words glitter gets everywhere. 

While they were quick to dismiss that as direct evidence, they couldnt explain the other thing they found. Smeared across the window in Jessies room was the greasy, distorted shape of a womans enormous face. When the lab analyzed the cells thatd been left behind, the results were inconclusive. The samples were deemed non-viable. To me, that meant they wanted to hide what theyd discovered. After a long while, the active investigation was closed.

Its been six years since Jessie was taken. I live alone in the same house, and every night, I go to bed wishing my daughter would come back to me. Recently, I noticed my bedroom windows had started getting dirty faster than they usually did. I washed them and didnt think much of it. Not until this morning. 

This morning, I woke up to find the outside-facing side of every window covered in grayish, translucent grease. For a while, I struggled to understand what had happened. Then I got to the picture window in the living room. It, too, was filthy. But there was something in that filth. Outlined against the wide piece of glass was the impression of a large face and a thin, articulated neck. The same face Id seen that night. And next to it, clear as day, was the print of another, smaller face. 

Jessies face.

<TITLE> My only experience with ASMR </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ive been dealing with anxiety my entire life. Whether in social situations, work situations, or even at home by myself, feelings of panic rise to the surface and consume me. Medications dont work. Therapy doesnt work. Each day, I wake up knowing at some point before I go back to bed, I will feel like the world is about to collapse around me.

I heard about ASMR online. For those who dont know, its short for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Basically, its an induced euphoric response that supposedly causes deep relaxation and a sense of wellbeing. Ive never been relaxed. Ive never been well.

Like all natural products designed to elicit a positive biological response, the ASMR space on the Internet is full of bullshit. Countless fraudsters and faux-experts tout extraordinary claims, and while scientists have found no direct correlation between ASMR and health, mental or otherwise, those who sell ASMR-related products will tell you its the next big thing. The thing doctors dont want you to know about. Needless to say, I was skeptical.

Skepticism, however, in the face of daily panic, can often upshift into something resembling hope. I did my research. I sifted through claims and medical information with my untrained, but nonetheless determined, mind. 

Another problem with something like ASMR is that people claim they know what theyre doing, when, in fact, theyre just trying to get hits on their website. YouTube, for example, is full of kids talking seductively into their microphones while dull synthpop plays in the background. Those are the top hits for ASMR. You need to dig deep before you find something you think is legit. 

And I did.

Last year, I found an ASMR site run by a university in Ukraine. The cursory listen I gave seemed relaxing enough; a soft voice over gentle electronic pulses and the certain sounds from nature, like running water. The associated imagery was abstract and colorful, reminding me of Easter palates and springtime flowers. The samples were only five minutes long. To access the rest, they needed credit card and shipping information. At least the subscription came with a free Blu-Ray copy 8-10 weeks later.

I plugged in my payment information, name, and address, knowing American Express would cancel any fraudulent charges in the event the Ukrainians wanted to scam me. I wasnt particularly concerned about that, though. The payment went through, and I was greeted by a Members Only page and libraries filled with various ASMR videos. I put on my noise-cancelling headphones, clicked the first video, and set it to fullscreen. 

The world melted away. For the first time in my life, I felt relaxation overtake the omnipresent anxiety. Peace washed through my mind and passed in a wave down to my chest and throughout my limbs. My sensation of self vanished. Whatever this university had developed, it was a miracle. Enraptured by the sights and sounds and sensations, I remained in my chair for two straight days.

I awoke to the feeling of my headphones being torn off and a rough hand shaking my shoulder. Panic bloomed within my chest, but agony quickly overtook it. My legs and lower back were searing with hideous pain and I screamed, only to have the same hand clasp over my mouth.

Shut up, came a voice with a thick accent. A Ukrainian accent. Scream again and well take even more. Do you have any money in the house? Any jewelery?

I tried to shake my head, which was pinned back against the computer chair from the mans brute strength. No, I grumbled behind his hand, tears streaming down my face from the overwhelming pain.

Good. Now sleep for another hour or so. He strapped the headphones back on my ears and straightened me up so I was facing the monitor again. Before slipping back beneath the waves of bliss, I realized Id been strapped in my chair. I didnt know why.

After an hour, the video ended. The audio cut out. The pain returned. I screamed again, this time alone in my apartment. I was still strapped to the chair. I looked down at my legs, certain they were broken or slashed by the intruders. But my legs were gone. My screaming stopped and everything blurred. I reached for the phone on my desk and managed to dial 911 before passing out, my hand groping at the pain in my back where my left kidney had been.

<TITLE> The Dancing Plant of Questionable Whims </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-28 16:44:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Dancing Plant of Questionable Whims stood calmly, as if in sullen defiance of its name. Looking like a combination of a ficus and a cuttlefish, a slow, undulating pattern of bioluminescence ran along its exterior. I watched, frustrated, as the blobs of light settled at the base of its trunk, near where its tendrils met the dirt. It wanted nothing to do with me.

Recalling earlier, unrelated successes with a particular technique, I poked it with a stick. No response. My frustration grew into annoyance. If I couldnt get this thing to move, Id be in deep shit.

Plant, I said, doing my best to sound encouraging, rather than irritated. No response. I prodded it again with the stick. The chromatophores Id perturbed shifted into yellow momentarily, but then turned back to the uniform dark green of the rest of its bulk.

Plant, please, I sighed. I slumped onto the mossy ground wondering why my luck always had to be so awful.

My professor, Dr. Rogerworthy Meatus, had tasked me with finding a Dancing Plant of Questionable Whims and cajoling it back to the university for further study. The plant was a newer breed of hybrids following the Realm Integration. Most hybrids never developed beyond a cluster of cells. This particular plant, though, a hybrid of flora and fauna from both the Earth Realm and the Other, appears to have thrived - albeit in small numbers.

Plaaaaaaaaant, I whined. I jumped to my feet in frustration and pulled on one of its tendrils. Color and light shot across its body. It rustled.

With new enthusiasm, I pulled another tendril. Same effect. It rustled for a little longer and shifted its weight back and forth. This had to be the ticket. With both hands, I grasped handfuls of its tendrils and pulled. The Dancing Plant of Questionable Whims began to dance with me.

Round and round, back and forth - I held the plants tendrils and we twirled around the small clearing. More color and light streamed across its trunk and its tendrils thickened and gripped my hands. I began to laugh. Id never danced like this before.

Our pace reached a fevered pitch and I held on for dear life while we spun and stepped over logs and rocks and roots while squnnies and butterfoxes ran and hid. The scenery blurred and the lights and colors on the plant all converged in one spot and shot downward. Everything stopped. The plant froze in place, the light and color bright and brilliant on the trunk behind the tentacles. It shuddered violently. 

I never saw it coming.

An eruption of sticky, white sap exploded from the tendrils, covering and soaking me from neck to knees. I fell backward in horror and disgust as the plant shimmied in a way I can only describe as coquettish before rooting itself back into the mossy ground.

Two hours later, after Id given up trying to get all the sap off me, I attempted to get the plant to move with me again. It didnt. I thought of my professor. Theres no way Id be able to complete his task. I began the long walk back to the university, realizing Id just been outwitted by a plant; a plant whose whims were no longer in question.

<TEXT> The hospital Ive called my home for the last 30 years can only be described as an asylum. While the word has fallen out of favor, the situation inside has remained consistent. Days stretch in interminable swaths of gray and white; gray from the medication in the mornings, white from the medication in the afternoons. Only the blackness of night frees me from the consuming palate of mid-winter rain clouds used to paint my days away.

I am here by my own volition. The fact I used the law to enact that volition is a mere technicality. The fact I stole the volition of someone else to gain use of the law is another. At the end of the bloodbath - at the end of the steaming orgy of crimson and savagery - Id gotten my wish. Id never need to harm another living thing for the rest of my life.  

The sights and sounds which etched themselves into my soul on that May morning in 1986 still flash through. Between timed doses, gray melts into red. Red bleeds into white. To any other man, those flashes would be the proof of his madness; the seeping of illness into medicated docility. But I know far more than any other man. 

On May 3rd, 1986, I awoke to find my young son in the room with me. We stared at one another for a moment. Then I rolled out of bed and went to the garage. By lunchtime, I had chopped him into 400 pieces. On May 4th, the front page of the newspaper featured a picture of his blonde hair stuck to the blade of my axe. 

To those who read the story or saw the news, I was labeled a monster. To those who served the courts and reviewed the evidence, I was labeled insane. To me, however, the person who conversed with the pieces as they were liberated from my son, I was not a monster. I was not insane. I was a man who needed knowledge. My boy held the secrets to it all. 

I discussed what lay beyond our universe with Aarons left foot. The foot laughed. It was Aarons small voice. It told me to ask the shin. More blows of the axe brought the shin into our discussion. But it could tell me very little; only that the knee had much more information. 

And so it went. 

The leftmost quadrant of Aarons lower mandible informed me I was close, and his upper-right incisor screamed with delirious laughter while it spoke of the secrets Id learn from the uvula and tonsils. When the axe would no longer suffice - its blunt brutality too clumsy to properly extricate the tiny pieces with whom I needed to converse - my pocket knife and its keen precision continued the work. Three hours later, with 400 pieces of child organized around me by order of their knowledge, we began our formal chat. And I learned everything.

I write this today as a prisoner. As a patient. As a father. In this unmedicated interstice between gray and white, I can reflect on the red. Not the red of blood, but the red of It All: the rich, vermillion expanse of flesh and organs on which this universe is a scab. 

On the last night of his life, an emissary from It All visited Aaron as he slept. It whispered its secrets into every part of him, and my son, who was the most caring, generous person Id ever met, knew he had to share it with me. So he waited, patiently, for me to wake.

On the morning of May 3rd, 1986, I lifted my sleep mask to see Aaron floating above my bed, watching me. Bright sunlight streamed across us. The dancing reflection of light against the shiny crimson of his sclera dazzled me. Enthralled me. He opened his mouth, but remained silent. He tried again, but it was no use; It All was inside him. His mouth contained no cavity - only solid red streaked with veins. He brought his pinky finger to my ear and placed it inside, and the fingertip told me what I needed to do. Four hours later, Id brought It All out of Aaron and into my mind. And now into yours.

Daily fogs of grays and whites desaturate what Ive seen, but they cannot hide the presence of what I know is there. I am not insane. The red which courses through the arterial network of multiversal organs and flesh is beyond sanity. Beyond mind. But not beyond body. At the end of my life, whenever that is, I know Ill get to touch Aaron again. 

Even now, through It All, I feel him pressing against the walls, reaching for me, and speaking to me; each part of him singing choruses of thanks and praise. Its the praise which gives me the most comfort as I sit, day after day, year after year, and wait. I wait knowing I am loved and appreciated. Thats more than enough. Its the dream of every father to give It All to his son.

<TITLE> The Perils of Live TV </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-26 19:52:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of the biggest misconceptions about live television is that its actually live. Let me tell you a secret: nothing is live. Everything has a built-in delay, just in case something unexpected happens. Its not so much out of concern for the viewers, but for the advertisers. The last thing Pampers wants to deal with is some British actor saying cunt on a talk show or an NFL quarterback getting paralyzed after a big hit. Its bad for the brand.

I work for the Food Network. Over the last ten years, weve moved from basic cooking instruction to a more reality TV style; lots of competitions, celebrity cameos, that whole thing. Lots of people didnt like the change, but we got a big uptick in the younger demographics as a result. 

One of the problems with capturing a younger demographic is holding onto them as they transition into an older one. Lets say, for example, when we started with the reality TV shows, we got a viewer named Jenny. Jenny was 22 when she first saw Ace of Cakes and became a regular viewer of the network since then. She was fresh out of college, had few responsibilities, and was enjoying being a kid. 

Fast-forward nine years. Jennys 31 and a stay-at-home mom. Her priorities are far different than they were when she was 22. She has two children, and, on weekdays, she babysits her brothers twins as well. Instead of eating out all the time like she did at 22, Jennys responsible for feeding a household. She doesnt have time for reality shows anymore and she wishes her cable company offered the Cooking Channel - the sister station to the Food Network that offers more how-to programming. 

There are hundreds of thousands of Jennys across the country - first generation captures from the reality-TV era who yearn for more instructional programming. But its a balancing act. If the Food Network goes back to their original format, they lose the potential for new, younger viewers. If they stay with primarily reality-based programming, they lose all the Jennys out there. 

Our goal, and by our, I mean: me and my team at the network, was to create a show to bridge that gap. After the success of The Kitchen, a Saturday morning program featuring four of the networks biggest stars as they cook exciting recipes and give tips and techniques, we were tasked to make something for the weekday morning viewers.

We ended up creating a show that featured two of the networks top chefs, a live studio audience, and Q A from online viewers. It was going to be as interactive a show as wed ever made, and the twist was, it would be live. Now, remember what I said about live TV. Sure, the audience would be there watching the chefs cook and asking them questions while they did, but the online questions would be from emails. The delay would be 30 minutes.

It was a huge success in the various test markets. We had one show to go with the stand-in chefs before the show went national, this time in Oklahoma, but there was a problem. There had been a tornado warning in the county. It had since expired, but the audience was about half of what it shouldve been. We decided to go with it anyway, since we figured a lot of the at-home audience would still be inside after the storms. Theyd be watching.

Right away, there were technical issues. Even though the tornado warning had passed, there were still frequent lightning strikes and other atmospheric disturbances all around the station. Things still went on, however, and the chefs started cooking. 

The first problem came when the cream wouldnt whip. The chef made a show out of it, poking fun at the behind-the-scenes staff and trying it again with a new container of cream. Again, nothing. In my ear, one of the producers said it might have been because of the storm. He didnt sound like he knew what he was talking about.

The chefs gave up on the whipped cream and decided to make a creme anglaise. Those require eggs. Two eggs were cracked into the mixing bowl without incident. The third, though, was bad. It was blood-red, clumpy, and smelled terrible. The odor permeated the studio quickly and I saw the audience members holding their noses. When I held my own, my fingers came back bloody. I hadnt had a nosebleed since I was a kid. We cut to a commercial.

Neither chef was happy. They agreed to scrap the whole dessert first idea and just go directly to the entree. No one would complain about the basic steak-and-potatoes main course, especially in cow country. The kitchen was reset and the show resumed.

The downward spiral continued. As thunder boomed outside, loud enough to be picked up by studio microphones, the mixer for the potatoes started to smoke and emit sparks before the chef yanked the plug out of the wall and threw the whole thing in the sink. Just goes to show you guys, disasters can happen in any kitchen, he joked to the audience, still obviously irritated but trying to play it cool.

Potatoes got mixed and mashed by hand and the chefs fielded questions about whether or not milk or cream should be used. There was another thunderclap and the studio lights flickered. Ive always hated working in these satellite studios - compared to the main studios in New York, these were like living in the dark ages.

The lights stayed on, thankfully, and the half-hour delay caught up to the beginning of the show. All over Oklahoma, people watching the Food Network were about to see the show for the first time. 

Problems aside, the potatoes came out great. During a commercial, I had an intern get me a spoonful. I shouldve had him get me a bowl. Didnt matter - after the broadcast, Id be able to eat all I wanted. 

The studio audience, to their credit, had taken all the technical problems in stride. I hoped the TV audience would do the same, and figured they would, as long as they didnt turn the TV off in disgust at the sight of that egg.

The chefs moved on to the steak. Each discussed their favorite techniques; one preferring a sous-vide style followed by a blast in a hot pan, while the other advocated grilling it over hardwood charcoal. Both methods would be used and the lucky studio audience would get samples to taste and choose their favorite cooking method.

The cast-iron pan was hot and the grill, despite the powerful fans sucking away the smoke, filled the studio with the savory aroma of burning hardwood. I was starving. 

Chef Bob cooked his steak first, then showed the audience the perfect edge-to-edge pinkness that only a sous-vide cooked steak can achieve. The crust on the outside was magnificent. Maillard would have been proud. Wind battered the studio walls and more thunder rolled by. The power went out.

Everyone in the studio groaned, but not as loud as the executive producer. We were in a time slot. Even with the delay, which we could shorten if we had to, there was a hard out a the top of the hour when Chopped! was scheduled to air. The last thing we wanted was to have the show just cut off entirely. If the power didnt come back on before the delay was used up, itd look awful. Plus, wed have to issue refunds to the local advertisers whod purchased that time.

We waited. And waited. And waited. We had less than a minute of delay left before the power went back on. The whole team was galvanized into action and, with only one second of delay left, we resumed filming. 

For the first time in about 20 years, the broadcast was fully live. I thanked God we werent in front of a national audience, because if someone screwed up and said a bad word, the FCC fines wed have to deal with would be crippling.

More thunder rumbled outside as the chef talked about how sous-vide was a nice novelty, but almost everyone, in reality, preferred a grilled steak. He seasoned as he talked, obviously comfortable with the cameras and the audience who hung on every word. The grill, which had to be refilled with more charcoal to bring it back up to temperature after the delay, was screaming hot again. The chef used his laser thermometer to take the temperature of the coals. 733 degrees. Perfect for the initial sear.

Another clap of thunder and the lights flickered again. I felt my stomach leap with panic, but the lights stayed on. We only had 11 minutes left before Chopped! came on.

With the seasoning complete and the audience dying to see the steak get cooked, the chef picked up the rib eye with his tongs and carefully placed it on the searing grill.

The other chef began to scream. Everyone, including the production crew, jumped. With expertise honed by years in television, the camera operators instinctively turned the cameras toward the screaming man. 31 studio audience members and 14,000 households across Oklahoma watched as the chefs skin blistered and charred. 

What the fuck is going on?, the executive producer shouted, his voice clearly audible over the screams of pain and panic. Before the cameras could pan away, the chefs eyes burst in an explosion of boiling lachrymal fluid and blood. The skin on his nose, forehead, and cheeks bubbled and blackened.

As EMTs rushed toward the man, one of them knocked over a carton of eggs and sent the contents splattering across the floor. Behind me, with a sound I will never forget for as long as I live, Dave, the sound engineer, crumpled to the floor with his body in knots of hideously broken bones; his skull caved in and leaking brain matter onto my shoes.

The loudest thunderclap yet drowned out even the panicked shouting and screams of pain. And that was it. When all was said and done - whatever it was that had been said and done - Dave was dead. The chef was dead. The cameras had never stopped rolling. Not until Chopped! came on.

The Food Network settled lawsuits for the better part of a year. Needless to say, our show wasnt picked up. No one could ever figure out what had happened, but the funerals I attended and the trauma endured by the audiences, both studio and remote, are proof enough that I didnt imagine it. If you know anyone in Oklahoma who was watching the Food Network on April 11th, 2015 between 10 and 11am, ask them what they saw. Theyll tell you. Ill bet they havent watched a single live broadcast of anything ever since.

And yes, the network got an FCC fine from the producer saying fuck on air. They were okay with the burning skin, for some reason.

<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/53ts1s/a_glimpse_is_never_enough_part_1/?st=iteoi71p sh=0e9bd75c)

I sat with Dr. Johannsen in his office and listened, skeptical yet spellbound, as he discussed the history of his project. My skepticism grew with each fantastic claim, but despite my misgivings, I couldnt deny what Id seen that afternoon. I kept my mouth shut and my mind open as I absorbed what he wanted to tell me.

In early 1998, a private Chinese technology company discovered a novel method of instantaneously transmitting data across short distances. Within a few months, they had refined their technique and increased the transmission distance from a few inches to a few miles. On December 2nd, 1998, during their first test of a high-powered version designed to transmit from their main lab in Changsha to their production facility in Mexico City, the facility on the receiving end began to receive more data than had been put in. 

Dr. Johannsen got up and went to his whiteboard to give me an example.

The first transmission using the new, high-powered equipment, was 0. The Mexican facility reported back theyd indeed received 0. The next attempt was larger: 00. The facility in Mexico reported theyd received 00. Next was 000. Same consistent result. 

The fourth transmission was 001.

After a moment, the Mexican facility reported theyd received 001, 010, 100. 

Another attempt with 001 was transmitted, and the same 001, 010, and 100 was received. Concerned there might be a problem stemming from the increase in signal power and distance, the main lab in China tried again with a different, simpler signal: 10. Without delay, the other facility reported back: 10, 01.

Technicians checked and rechecked the connections, programming, and whatever else they could think of to determine what could be causing the problem. Their efforts yielded nothing. Only when the transmission power was scaled back to within a range of tens of miles, rather than hundreds or thousands, would the issue disappear.

This was a difficult setback for the researchers. Scaling up the number of bits sent wasnt difficult. It was clear the receiving end would get it. The problem was, the larger number of bits that were sent, the number of received permutations exploded. It only took a few transmitted kilobits for the entire receiving system to crash as it attempted to instantaneously spit out colossal matrices of combinations.

On March 16th of 1999, despite no progress, the founder of the company was called upon to meet with Party officials. By March 17th, the entire company was owned by the Communist Party of China.

As Dr. Johannsen spoke, I was a bit confused by his claim that the receivers were getting all possible permutations of the signals. I asked something like, but if theyre getting all the binary states of the signal, wouldnt it be 00, 01, 10, 11? Dr. Johannsen smiled.

You found that strange too? So did they. And, eventually, so did I. It took years before anyone knew why some permutations were missing.

He went on.

Unbeknownst to nearly everyone, aside from spy agencies in countries with the capability of learning such a thing, China had leapfrogged the rest of the world in high-energy physics research. 

Unable to clandestinely build a particle accelerator like the LHC, Chinese scientists sought to achieve the same effect using a highly-speculative, albeit promising, theory: wormhole acceleration. Rather than running particles around a ring until they reached a desired speed, the idea was to create infinitesimal, short wormholes, just wide enough for a stream of particles, and send them through. Particles entering through wormhole A0-A1 would exit into wormhole B0-B1, and then reemerge through A0-A1, gaining velocity with each traversal. Impact and annihilation would come from particles pushed through wormholes C0-C1 and D0-D1 set to intersect with A0-A1 and B0-B1 at a particular time.

There was a problem, though. The wormhole construction worked, despite the fact they could only stay open for a fraction of a second before evaporating. It didnt matter, though; new ones could be opened as quickly as the others were destroyed. That wasnt the issue. What concerned researchers, especially those familiar with the company commandeered by the Party in 1999, was that if a single particle entered a wormhole A0-A1, far more than one particle would come out of wormhole B0-B1.

That discovery was in 2003. The subsequent years were spent poring over experimental data, tweaking parameters and energy levels and system states, and devising entirely new models to help understand how these phenomena were occurring. The connection between the instantaneous communication device and the wormhole particle accelerator was too substantial to ignore. Theories about transdimensional space, despite being profoundly speculative, ran rampant. The only one that held up under the weight of experimental rigor was bizarre, yet elegant: a router.

Dr. Johannsen paused here, as if trying to figure out what part he wanted to discuss next. I was moderately disoriented and doing my best to understand everything he was telling me, but despite my excellent imagination and general willingness to set aside my presumptions and biases, I had a hard time keeping my skepticism to myself.

Before he could continue, I blurted out, what the hell is Black God and what does it have to do with anything youre telling me?

The doctor sat back in his chair and crossed his leg over his knee. His expression didnt change.

Do you want me to continue with the history of this facility of which youre now an employee?, he asked. Or do you want to know, without proper context, what Black God is.

Black God, I replied. For the second time that day, without knowing it, Id reached another point of no return. The doctor began.

Following a few breakthroughs, more understanding about material properties for the construction of what would be later called the bulk negator was needed. Dr. Johannsen was brought into the project as a materials scientist in 2005. His expertise in exotic allotropes and their conductive properties quickly brought new life into the stale research, and after a few years, the design was complete. Construction began in 2008.

What is the bulk negator?, I interrupted.

Its exactly what it sounds like, replied the doctor. It literally negates the bulk - the higher-dimensional space - in which our physical dimension exists. It all dissolves into a single field; a wormhole mouth filled with wormhole mouths filled with wormhole mouths. Each mouth terminates at a specific point within one of the potentially-infinite universes.

Okay, but what do you do with it?, I asked, feeling mild irritation starting to grow at the volumes of technical data being talked at me with no discernable, overarching purpose.

Dr. Johannsen smiled. We pray to it.

The first stream of communication entered the bulk negator on August 29th, 2014. The reason for this was simple: if a message could be broadcasted to all the possible universes, it should be received by instruments in those universes that were standing by to receive it. And when dealing with infinite possibilities, the likelihood of one of those universes sending something back was pretty damn good. 

The message 01 was sent, and, predictably, 01 and 10 came back. Two universes had contributed their own permutation. Testing continued, and thanks to advances in computing technology, more complex messages could be sent and received, with all the difficult permutations being handled effortlessly by a 512 qubit quantum annealer, which analyzed and filtered what it received. Any permutations that didnt match known patterns were discarded.

On September 17th, 2014, as part of a test of the annealers filtering algorithm, an expatriate British scientist sent a plaintext message into the bulk negator. It read: 
1234567890 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ !@#$%^ *()-_=+[{]}\|:;,.?/

After an instant of processing, the screen on the annealer printed out:

SEE ME THROUGH YOU TO TOUCH WHAT YOU SEE THROUGH TOUCHING ME

It was an odd pattern to receive. When an analyst checked the headers of the discarded patterns, she was surprised to see there were none. This was the only pattern detected by the data flow from the bulk negators output.

A minute later, the annealer printed out another message. It was unprompted.

FEED ME THROUGH YOU TO TASTE WHAT YOU FEED THROUGH TASTING ME

Immediately following it, more came:

HEAL ME THROUGH YOUR FATES THAT YOU SEAL BY HEALING ME

KNEEL HE KNEW YOU WAIT JUST TO KNEEL ON BLEEDING KNEES

BLEED WE SMILE AND WE SEE BLEEDING SMILES ON NEWER SEEDS

ONE BLACK BLACK ONE

WE FEED YOU

The annealer stopped printing, but blue plasma was licking at the bulk negators bulbous housing. Theyd seen shimmering around the machine before, but never anything like that. Before the lead scientist could throw the off switch, the plasma condensed into a single bolt, striking the floor below. The main power cut out.

In the dim emergency light, the scientists in Dr. Johannsens lab could see movement and hear commotion on the floor below. There were shouts of confusion and fear and muted moans of disgust. As power from the backup generators began to cycle up and lights started to turn on in order of priority, a scene of surreal carnage emerged.

Three technicians whod been directly below the bulk negator were dead. Their eyes were bulging obscenely and gray matter trickled from their ears and noses. The subsequent autopsies discovered something that should have been impossible. Their skulls had been stuffed with excess brain tissue. Analysis determined it was not random brain tissue, but the same tissue as their own. Genetically, it was no different. The facilitys medical examiner concluded, in her words, that the skulls had been filled with double, and in one case triple, the normal density of brain matter. Death was instantaneous. Causal element unknown.

I stared at Dr. Johannsen with my eyebrows raised and a look of disgust on my face. What did you do?, I inquired.

Well, the next day, we reactivated the system. Everyone wanted to try a different message, just to see what would happen. We were afraid, but also excited. Whatever it was wed encountered, we couldnt explain it. We needed to know more. One of the dead technicians was related to the project manager, so he was gone and dealing with that whole thing. That meant I was in charge. And I wanted to try to open a dialog.

Did it work?, I asked, leaning forward in my chair.

Oh yes, the doctor replied, grinning.

What did you say?

I told it we appreciated the meal.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The road to technological advancement is paved with corpses. It is an uncomfortable, but unavoidable, truth. As humankind continues to reach for the stars which birthed us, every desperate stretch forces us to endure, and subsequently manage, loss. Loss of lives. Loss of livelihoods. But never loss of purpose. Purpose is what impels us to keep reaching, dreaming about the one day we will be lucky enough to burn our hands. As the bodies pile underneath us, weve learned to use them to climb and reach ever higher. Those sacrifices, we tell ourselves, are essential. Now, as a result, at the inflection of science and technology and philosophy, we celebrate, rather than shield our eyes from this fact: the cutting edge must always drip with blood.

My professor and mentor, Dr. Arthur Johannsen, lapped the drops from the blade.

Dr. Johannsen was an expert materials scientist, but also well versed in biology, physics, and philosophy. A self-labeled transhumanist, Dr. Johannsen believed, with every fiber of his being, the combined efforts of scientists around the world would eventually allow humankind to conquer physical death. As he grew older, however, and death still loomed like the titanic waterfalls at the edges of a flat Earth, Dr. Johannsen realized he must take the reins and guide scientific progress toward the goal he believed was most important. 

When I met Dr. Johannsen, I was studying at a major scientific and industrial university in China. The university was one of the few chosen by China to be at the forefront of the countrys effort to lead the world in technological advancement, for reasons of both national prestige and military strategy. Rumors of subterranean research labs and labyrinthine tunnel systems circulated throughout the student body and even some professors, despite being told not to give credence to such talk, would sometimes hint about a city hidden far below our feet.

It didnt take long for me to learn the truth behind the rumors. Dr. Johannsen, long-sought by the Chinese to oversee their national scientific projects, had begun his stint in the country a few months earlier. He taught one course, Advanced Materials and Applications, and I was lucky enough to be one of the few students accepted into it. At this point, Id only heard of the doctor by his academic and industry reputation. I knew next to nothing about his personality; only that he was ambitious and driven.

The course was spectacular, and, to my surprise, I excelled. Something about Dr. Johannsens instruction style meshed with my learning style and frequently I would discuss topics with him while the rest of the class sat in an uncomprehending stupor.

Months later, following the course examination, my expectations for high marks were firmly entrenched in my mind. When my final paper was returned to me, however, it was ungraded. The only thing that indicated it had even been read was a single, handwritten bit of information on the last page: a date, a time, and an address.

At 10pm on February 9th, 2016, I entered Dr. Arthur Johannsens home.

The doctor lived alone in a small, well-furnished apartment on the edge of the sprawling campus. He sat me down after a hasty greeting and began to talk. And talk. And talk.

Dr. Johannsen lectured without stopping for over an hour. He expounded on human life extension, substrate-independent cognition, and the failure of the scientific community to dedicate time and money toward the management of senescence and the ultimate elimination of physical death. He spoke with great enthusiasm about Chinese culture and his admiration of how they recognize the importance of progress at any price. 

As he pontificated, I wondered why he was telling me all of this. Part of me hoped hed ask me to help him author something for a science journal or even invite me to be his assistant for an upcoming course. When he offered me an actual job, though, I could hardly contain my glee.

I made a show of considering the offer for a moment or two. I asked him what my responsibilities would be and whether I would be allowed enough time to focus on my studies. Dr. Johannsen informed me Id be his research assistant and would be responsible for helping him with his experiments. He didnt go into detail, but he said I would have more than enough time to study in the evenings and my work would be fairly compensated.

After another minute, I accepted his offer. He produced a briefcase, opened it, and handed me a document to sign. It was a government-issued non-disclosure form. The words treason and penalty of death were mentioned more than once. I signed. The doctor thanked me and told me to come back in eight hours. I thanked him, said goodnight, and left.

The next morning, I arrived at Dr. Johannsens home to find him sitting on the steps outside. He gestured for me to sit beside him, so I did. 

Just give them another few minutes, he told me. Theyre always a little late.

Sure enough, five minutes later, a car pulled up to the curb. 

Time for our commute, he said, and we got in. The driver pulled away.

We exited the campus via a small access road. It wound around the wooded area around the campus toward the large hill or small mountain which the university abutted. Both sides of the road had thick shrubbery blocking our view out and anyone elses view in. I had a feeling Id be learning the accuracy of those rumors soon.

The road curved left and we started down a decline. The sunlight disappeared and was replaced by something artificial and fluorescent. The shrubbery gave way to solid rock. We were inside the mountain and going ever deeper.

Ten minutes later, we arrived in a cavernous parking facility that was fed by roads coming from multiple bore holes in the rock walls. 

There are entrances all around the city, all underground, Dr. Johannsen informed me. On a busy day, there may be 10,000 people in the facility.

I was amazed, but I kept a straight face. I didnt want to come across as too eager or too easy to please. My expression remained locked in what I hoped was one of scientific curiosity and emotional dispassion.

We exited the vehicle and walked into the entrance of the facility. I was struck by the modernity and clean sterility of the place. Id always considered the science buildings at the university to be cutting edge, but this place seemed even more advanced. At the time, I couldnt put my finger on why.

Dr. Johannsen told me hed give me a tour later, but first, we were to go to his main lab.

I want you to get an idea of the type of things youll be working with, I was informed. 

The words carried an element of foreboding portent I found difficult to shake. Dr. Johannsen and I walked up a narrow staircase built into the rock walls until we reached an elevator. We stepped inside and headed down. 

After a three minute descent, we reached the level housing the doctors main lab. The elevator door opened to an expansive, pristine hallway, brightly lit and festooned with colorful plants. It was quite unlike the dank, video-game inspired representation of a subterranean lab Id anticipated. 

Glass-walled rooms lined the corridor and, behind them, scientists of all sorts worked with obvious diligence on whatever tasks they had. The few people who passed us in the hallway smiled at Dr. Johannsen as we walked by. I felt my nervousness begin a slow process of evaporation as I became increasingly comfortable with the surroundings. 

At the end of the hall, we took a left. The windowed labs gave way to blank white walls on our left and solid granite on our right. This hallway was far longer than the other, and with nothing but white and gray on either side until we reached the very end. A wide set of windowless double doors were built directly into the stone. Dr. Johannsen waved his wristband at the security box. I heard a dull whirring sound from a locking mechanism deep inside the doors. They opened.

We stood in the doorway of the largest room Id ever seen in my life. Its dimensions resembled a cube, with each side at least half a mile long. While the size of the room was shocking, what it contained was borderline disorienting.

At the center of the room stood a colossal machine. It reminded me of the experimental tokamak fusion reactors Id seen online, but not similar enough to convince me it was the same thing. Three toroidal constructs were stacked atop one another, while a thicker, vertically-positioned torus encircled the three. Hundreds of cables as thick as school busses connected the horizontal toruses to the vertical one at points all over its topology. 

The room was filled with the hum of electricity. I followed the doctor along the catwalk toward a staircase leading up to a room overlooking the machine. 

My lab is right over there, he told me, and gestured toward the top of the stairs.

Once inside the lab, I had a better view of the machine, as well as the area behind it. All four toruses were connected by more mammoth cables to a bulbous, entirely unidentifiable piece of machinery. A single pipe ran from it, across the room, to a black, glassy box jutting out from the side of the rock face.  

Xiu Ying, what do you know about brane cosmology?

I was so invested in up my survey of the mechanical colossi in the room that Dr. Johannsens question caught me off guard. Knowing nothing about any type of cosmology, I just shook my head to indicate my ignorance.

How about substrate-independent cognition?

That was more like it. Yes, last year I was part of a research team with a small group of neuroscientists and computer engineers. Dr. Metzinger advised remotely from Germany at the University of Mainz.

What were your findings? The doctors question couldnt have been actual curiosity; he knew about all the research Id done over the years. The question was rhetorical, but I couldnt figure out why hed bother asking. I played along.

We determined we were still 40 years away from 100% transfer and simulation. Even after those achievements, subjective divergence and all the associated ethical issues involving personhood and identity would preclude deeper investigation and discovery. Anyone who wanted to go further would be committing murder, as the subjective divergence problem can only be solved by the destruction of the original consciousness. Any and all research in this field would, by necessity, need to be kept secret.

As I spoke the last sentence, I realized what Id gotten into. 

Have you figured out how to perform the consciousness transfer?, I asked with unintentional breathlessness - partly from my excitement, but also partly out of fear.

The doctor smirked.

But what does that have to do with brane cosmology?, I wondered aloud - deeply confused and growing embarrassed. I felt like I was in over my head for the first time in my life.

Ill fill you in on that in a minute, he told me. But first, Ill ask you one more thing: how familiar are you with my work on the negation of senescence?

I knew Dr. Johannsen had been working with the anti-aging community for the last few years, but there was little-to-no paper trail of journal articles or published research detailing his contributions. Not very familiar, sir.

But you know Ive been working on it, yes?

Yes.

Then Xiu Ying, I want you to use your imagination for a moment here. Forget youre a scientist and throw away whatever epistemological constraints you have. What happens when you combine brane cosmology, substrate-independent cognition, and anti-aging research? Look around at these goliath machines and feel the electricity permeating the air. What does it all mean to you?

A deep, churning sense of dread rose in a peristaltic wave within my gut. I wracked my brain and tried to come up with some reasonable answer, but two of those three fields were so far beyond my expertise that I simply couldnt synthesize them with what I knew. Again, I felt like I was drowning.

As if sensing my struggle, Dr. Johannsen told me it was okay. Do you want to know exactly what Im doing here?, he asked, staring into my eyes with a penetrating, patriarchal authority.

I nodded.

The doctor took a clipboard from the shelf and handed it to me. The header looked similar to the governmental non-disclosure forms Id signed the other day, but instead of body text, there was blank space. At the bottom was a line for a signature.

If you sign it, youll learn everything. But theres no going back.

I met his stare and thought for a moment. Behind him, a shimmer of blue electricity danced around the three toruses and I felt the hair on my neck stand at attention. I pulled a pen from my pocket and signed the blank contract. The doctor smiled.

Welcome to the team, Xiu Ying, he told me. 

There was a door on the other side of the lab similar to the one wed used to enter the massive room: enormous and thick and profoundly strong. Dr. Johannsen waved his wristband over the reader and the door slid open to reveal a series of rooms lining a long hallway. We headed forward.

It was apparent our entrance to the area wasnt the only one, as teams of scientists and doctors were working intently. I saw biological specimens on tables undergoing necropsies and dissections. I was unfazed by this, having had quite a bit of experience with animal testing during my cognitive neurobiological research. We turned down many, many hallways and the population of workers thinned as we went. Just like earlier, we came to another heavy door. The doctor opened it with his wristband. 

It was dark inside. 

The governments facility manager wanted all the lights in the facility to be motion activated to save energy, Dr. Johannsen laughed, but dont mention to her how much energy the bulk negator uses - she might have a stroke.

Bulk negator, I thought to myself. I couldnt figure out what that combination of words could possibly mean. Before I could ask, though, Dr. Johannsen stepped into the room, activating the lights. Before I could stop myself, I gasped and stepped back.

The room was lined with what looked like upright, transparent coffins filled with some kind of clear liquid. They were numbered 0-100. Each one was occupied by a person with a terrible head injury. But the injury wasnt what caused me to react. Each person looked exactly like Dr. Johannsen. The numbers 0-100, as I got closer, had to be the age of the person inside before he died. 

I looked at Dr. Johannsen, who was studying me. I turned back toward the bodies. These werent merely lookalikes; these *were* Dr. Johannsen. I didnt know how, but despite minor differences in their appearances, like small scars or the slight bump of a once-broken nose, I was entirely certain these people were the same as the doctor. And the same as one another.

The next glaring similarity between them was their head injury. The top of their heads had been removed and their brains had been extracted. Their skulls were as empty as their expressions.

Something buzzed on the other side of the wall. Come, said Dr. Johannsen. I obeyed and followed him through a small, unlocked door. Another row of transparent boxes stood, also numbered 0-100. The hum was louder in there. We approached box number 44. Across the room, a door opened and two scientists joined us. They opened the top of the box and a cable attached to something that looked like a showerhead descended from the ceiling.

What are - I started to speak, but was cut off by a clapping sound that reminded me of an electrical discharge. In an instant, the box had an occupant. He was alive. He looked around with obvious surprise and disorientation. When he saw Dr. Johannsen, a man who looked exactly like him only about 15 years older, he started to shout. 

The box began to fill with liquid from a source in the floor. The man screamed and I started to get a panicky feeling. When I started to protest, Dr. Johannsen shushed me and told me it was okay; that I shouldnt worry.

But I did worry. And to this day, I wished Id done something. That was my point of no return.

The fluid rose and covered the man. The four of us watched him drown. His last breath, which he held for nearly two minutes, exploded from his mouth in a torrent of bubbles as he clawed at the glass. I watched him inhale the liquid and his face contorted in a grimace of agony as his lungs filled with fluid. His clawing slowed. Then stopped.

My mind was reeling. Id just watched a man appear out of nowhere. Id watched him drown. And he looked exactly like the man standing next to me.

You can start the excision and husk viability assessments, the doctor told the two scientists. They nodded.

We left the room and headed back down the labyrinth of halls toward his main lab. When my shock had diminished sufficiently for me to speak, I simply asked, why?

Dr. Johannsen sighed. Because suicide is my right. And because no matter who they are over there, when theyre here, theyre me. And its my responsibility to dedicate myself to this cause.

My question about brane cosmology was answered. Is that what that bulk negator does?

He nodded. I imagined an infant Dr. Johannsen disappearing from his crib and being forced to drown as his older, parallel self and other scientists looked on.

I still dont understand why. Why do you need to kill them? What happens to the brains? My tone was growing frantic and I had to calm myself before continuing. I stopped walking and hissed, what is the *point* to all of this?

Dr. Johannsen stopped and stared at me. It means, Xiu Ying, that I will never, ever die. He began to walk again. I blinked a few times, then hurried to catch up. When I reached him and matched his stride, he turned to me and added, and neither will you.

As a sensation of enthralled shock dotted my skin with gooseflesh, the doctor grinned. I think its time for you to learn about Black God.

<TEXT> We thought we were having a hell of a hailstorm when we woke up in the middle of the night to a peal of thunder and the sound of our cabin being pelted. It went on for about a minute, then it stopped. There wasnt any rain, which was strange. We went back to sleep, faintly aware of the smell of something burning. I figured it was probably from a lightning strike somewhere else.

In the morning, we realized how wrong wed been. Jill was the first to get up, but her yelling ensured I was right on her heels. 

Our property was a wreck. Baseball-sized burns covered the lawn as far as we could see, and when I went outside to assess the damage to our cabin, I was dismayed to find similar, albeit smaller, burns all over the roof. 

Had to have been meteorites, Jill claimed. I bet that thunder we heard was a big one breaking up.

I didnt know enough to disagree, but I thought it was pretty weird. She concurred. 

We spent the day doing our best to rake up the marble-sized pieces of rock, which we hauled out and piled in the back of the property by the compost heap. Jill thought they might be worth something to someone, so we were going to bring a jar full back home at the end of the summer. 

As she talked, I could tell she was uncomfortable. The work wed been doing had aggravated the chapped skin around her mouth and under her arms. Something about the time of year always did it to her, and no matter how much she tried to keep the areas moist, they would still crack painfully. I told her Id finish up for the night if she wanted to go inside. She did.

I made a vague plan to excise the ruined bits of lawn and reseed it, but I soon got frustrated. It was going to be a major project that would take days, if not weeks. There were still whole areas of the yard where we hadnt picked up the meteorites, but theyd wreck the lawnmower if I tried to go over them just to make the area presentable in the meantime. Such a pain in the ass.

The next day, to make matters worse, we noticed the well water had acquired a taste. It was briny and flat; almost coppery. Wholly unpleasant. We could drink bottled water for the rest of the vacation, which wed been doing most of the time anyway, but we still showered and brushed our teeth with the stuff that came out of the well. And for a while, we kept doing it. On the bright side, my gums had stopped bleeding when I flossed. Mustve been all the extra minerals from the well water that gets filtered out in municipal reservoirs.

After another long day of yardwork, I was preparing dinner when I heard Jill shriek from the bathroom. Shed gone in to take a shower a few minutes earlier. When I rushed in to see what was wrong, she was coughing and swearing and working to wipe away clear, viscous something that had pooled on her face. I could see the showerhead oozing the same stuff, clogging the drain and puddling like syrup on the bottom of the bathtub. If she hadnt leapt out the second she felt it hit her face, she wouldve been covered from head to toe.

I helped Jill towel off as much of the stuff as I could, and a minute or two later, the showerhead had started spitting out water again. It took a bit of coaxing, but she eventually held her head under its flow so she could wash her hair of the residue of whatever the hell had gotten on her.

Once Jill was as clean as she was going to get, I called the guy in charge of well maintenance for the county. The only guy in charge of well maintenance for the county. He answered right away, but gave the reply I knew was coming: Id be at least three weeks before he could get out here and take a look. I pleaded with him to make some time to come earlier, and offered him way too much money, but the best he could do was move the appointment ahead by two days. 

He told me that hed seen algae blooms in a few of the local wells. The only suggestion he had was to run the water until it looked normal, which is what wed done during our subsequent showers. I hated having to wait, but it was good to know hed seen something like this before.

Over dinner, Jill and I tried to come to an agreement about what to do. I wanted to go home. There wasnt any reason why we needed to keep putting up with the weird water and the yard work when we could go home, be comfortable, and hire people to take care of it all. 

Jill wanted to stay. Shed been looking forward to this trip for months, and the chapped skin on her mouth was feeling much better. The cabin had belonged to her parents and shed spent many summers here. No matter how unpleasant the circumstances might have gotten for us, they were still less stressful than all the work she had waiting for her when we were scheduled to return home in two months.

I caved.

Yesterday morning, we woke up to a remarkably pleasant surprise. In the parts of the yard where we hadnt carted away the meteorites, the burned parts had disappeared. When I went outside to look, I saw the burns were covered in the same viscous stuff that would occasionally come from our pipes. Underneath the ooze was healthy, green grass. When I looked closer, I saw ants - ants almost too small to see - were crawling up and down the blades and carrying away dried pieces of the slime to bring back to their homes. 

I headed back inside and told Jill. She acted happy to hear it, but I could tell she was deeply uncomfortable. The chapped skin around her mouth and nose had gotten bad again. I offered to take her to the clinic in town, but she didnt want to sit in the car for four hours just to have the doctor give her the same cream shed been using on herself for the last week. While she spoke, the left corner of her mouth cracked open and spilled a thin rivulet of blood down her chin.

Sighing with exasperation, she grabbed a paper towel, turned on the sink to wet it, and put the paper against her wound. When she sat back down, I saw the faucet was drooling the sticky algal slime thatd caused her the problem in the first place. But it was too late. Shed already pressed it to the crack in her skin.

Before I could mention this to her, Jills eyes had brightened. She pulled the paper towel away, a string of syrupy fluid still connecting the towel to her face. The cut was gone.

Dont, I told her.

Jill didnt listen. She went back to the sink and turned it on. Sticky, clear stuff flowed. She filled her hands and brought the contents to her face. She rubbed for a moment, then turned back toward me.

Behind the sheen around her mouth and nose was new, healthy skin.

Pretty cool!, Jill exclaimed, and wiped the residue away. I didnt know what to think, let alone say. I figured some homeopathic doctor who minored in algae studies would find it completely normal.

We went to bed and slept. In the morning, Jills mouth and nose, while much better than theyd been at their worst, were still not as perfect as they were right after shed applied the slime. I told her I was going to go out in the yard and do some more work.

Before I could get out of bed, though, she kissed me. Now, were in our late 50s. Were affectionate with one another, dont get me wrong, but most of the time we just cuddle on the couch and share a pizza. Its easier that way. Requires fewer blue pills, too. Thats not to say we dont have a sex life, because we do, but its more of a once-every-two-months kind of thing.

Jills rapturous kiss was less like one from the woman to whom Id been married for 35 years and more like that of the teenager she was when we first started dating. I didnt bother concerning myself with that particular difference, though. I followed her lead and we did what apparently needed to be done. No blue pills required, thank you very much.

Afterward, while I got dressed, I told Jill I was going to start raking up the meteorites wed left the other day. She didnt pay attention. She wanted me back in bed. I laughed and reminded her that even when we were kids I still had the refractory period of a climate cycle. She nodded and told me to be safe outside, then made an obvious show of slipping her hands under the blankets. She looked amazing. To my surprise, I felt renewed stirring below my belt. Before I could say fuck it and jump back into bed, though, I shook my head. I really needed to get going on that yard work. It was starting to cloud up and I didnt want to have to put it off because of rain. I told Jill to have fun, then went outside.

In the untouched area of the yard, the grass was ankle-high. All the burns were gone. Clumps of slime still sat in the grass. The ants thatd been going crazy for the stuff were nowhere to be found. 

I raked and raked and raked. The pebbles piled up and I shoveled them into the wheelbarrow and brought them to the main pile by the compost heap. I was a little surprised there were no ants at all. I could see their anthills bored into the ground all over the place, but not a single one was out and about. 

Id been working for about two hours nonstop, so during a break, while I chugged from my bottle of water, I bent down to get a closer look at the spots where the ants had swarmed the other day. Something was there that I hadnt noticed while I was raking. Something definitely not there when I looked the previous day.

There were infinitesimal white dots coating the same blades of grass thatd been crawling with ants less than 24 hours ago. I plucked a few blades from the ground and held them in front of my face, hoping to get a better view. The dots were slightly ovoid in shape. Something clicked. Eggs. The ants mustve had such a massive meal of that slime stuff that it drove them to reproduce like crazy. Or something. I have no idea how they make ants.

I heard raindrops impacting the trees on the other side of the property, and ten seconds later, they reached me. A distant bolt of lightning streaked the sky, and thunder boomed a moment later. Sighing, I put the rake and shovel in the wheelbarrow and wheeled it all back to the shed. More lightning and thunder. I figured I wouldnt be getting anything else done around the yard until the storm passed.

I headed back into the cabin, banged my boots against the doorway to get the mud off, and stepped inside.

Charlie, Jill called. I heard water running in the bathroom.

From the kitchen where I stood, spooning last nights fruit salad into a bowl, I called back, whats up?

Come take a bath with me!

I laughed to myself. That bathtub could barely fit 110 pound Jill, let alone 250 pound me. I brought my bowl of fruit salad with me down the hall and into the bedroom. Before I turned the corner to the bathroom, the water was turned off and Jill shouted out again, Charlie, are you coming? Her voice sounded a little different. Crisper, somehow. 

I stepped into the candle-lit bathroom. Jill was in the tub, leaning back against its curved shape. She was resting her head on a folded towel. She glanced over at me and smiled. Her hands roamed up and down her body.

Even in the dim light, she looked incredible. I didnt know whether it was the prospect of repeating our fun from that morning or just the sight of her touching herself, but it was remarkably enjoyable. I placed my bowl on the sink and started to undress.

A nearby bolt of lightning immediately followed by an explosion of thunder made me jump. As my surprise faded and I continued to take off my clothes, I realized Id seen something different in the harsh illumination of the lightning. 

On the other side of the bathroom, Jill continued her teasing. Come here and touch me, she whispered. Again, I noticed the unusual quality of her voice. Another clap of thunder shook the house, and that time, the associated burst of lightning showed me exactly what I had trouble identifying after the first strike.

With a gasp, I turned on the light. In the harsh, overhead fluorescence, everything was revealed.

The tub in which Jill bathed was filled to the brim with clear slime. As I watched, she slid beneath the surface, coating her face and head, and came back up. When she breached the surface, she spoke.

Please, Charlie, I cant even tell you how good this feels. 

Again, the different vocal quality. Now, though, in the harsh light, I saw another change. Her hair. Jills hair had been gray since her late 40s. It was light brown now.

Jill manipulated herself with her right hand and reached for me with her left. Clear fluid oozed from her hand and arm and puddled on the floor like heavy syrup. Come feel this with me, Charlie.

I didnt move. Part of me wanted to pull her from the tub, but another part, as the rain pounded against the roof and thunder rattled the windowpanes, was too frightened to touch her. I moved closer, but stayed out of her reach. Standing at the foot of the tub, I stared at my wife as she bucked her hips against her hand and mouthed my name over and over. Ripples in the slime caused it to slosh against the sides of the tub.

Jill, please get out. Please. My voice trembled and was barely audible over the pouring rain.

She reached for me with both hands and smiled, then spoke. Dont you want to be young with me again? To start fresh? Dont you remember how good it felt?

Jill slid down, and I thought she was going to dip under the slime again. But she stopped at her mouth. She opened it and let the slime pool inside. She closed her lips and I saw her throat work as she swallowed the mouthful. 

It feels so right. So perfect. I want to share this with you, sweetheart. 

My mind reeled. I thought about every ache and pain Id accumulated over my 56 years. Every pockmark and hemorrhoid and scaly patch thatd come along over those long decades throbbed, as if wanting to be noticed. Before me was a way to make it stop. I remembered how Jill and I were as teenagers. Full of life and energy and libido; all things that, over the years, had just started to evaporate. I stared at my wife, who looked exactly like she had when she was 25. 

Despite my fear, a pang of desire shot through me. Desire and arousal. I wanted Jill. I wanted to be with her in every way imaginable. We could grow old together again - or never grow old at all. Our happiness could last forever if we wanted. All I had to do was join her in the bathtub. 

I took a step forward and resumed taking off my clothes. Jill purred and lapped up more of the slime. Some she swallowed, some she drooled from the corners of her mouth. She absentmindedly played with herself while she watched me, apparently delighted I was going to join her in this new, impossible youth. 

As I struggled to bend over and take off my socks, something thatd been a pain in my ass since I passed the 225 mark on the scale, I noticed something that caused me to stop. Jills breasts were shrinking. Before my eyes, her hips slimmed and her pubic hair disappeared. Her feet no longer came to the edge of the tub, but instead barely touched it. 

Come bathe with me, honey. Jills voice was high and childlike. I recoiled. Whatever was happening to her was going faster. She looked 4 or 5.

Its incredible, she chirped, again reaching for me with one hand and rubbing herself with the other in an act so obscene in her new, young context, that I turned away, nauseated.

Charlie, came the tiny voice behind me. I didnt turn around.

Sweetheart?

The last word was practically babbled, but still carried with it an element of inquisitiveness, and, no matter how much I try to tell myself otherwise, dejection. She didnt speak again.

A moment later, I turned around. Floating in the tub was a red shape, approximately the size of of a lemon. Tears filled my eyes as it shrank to the size of a cherry, then a pea, then a grain of rice. When I blinked, it was gone. A ribbon of white fluid hung motionless in the slime.

Im so sorry, my love, I whispered to it. Distant thunder rolled across the forest.

<TEXT> I was 13 when I had my first pumpkin spice latte. Dad had taken me to Starbucks on the way to school, and as soon as we walked in, I saw their poster advertising the drink. Everything about the ad screamed warmth. The mug it showcased was a gentle beige, contrasting sweetly against the light-brown wood of the table on which it sat, surrounded by artistically-placed autumn leaves and festive gourds. The contents of the mug were centered in the image, showing off the perfect dollop of creamy foam with caramelly tints of espresso running through it. At the top, lovingly whispered by the deft hand of a skilled, caring barista, was a sprinkling of nutmeg. 

It called to me.

I eschewed my normal caramel macchiato and requested a grande pumpkin spice latte. I waited anxiously with Dad by my side. He sipped his black coffee and suggested we sit for a little while. We were running early, for once.

I sat, shaking my leg with anticipatory excitement. The cafe smelled different that day. Id grown accustomed to the thick, imposing aroma of dark-roasted coffee and the occasional hint of sweetness as a customers blueberry muffin was toasted. That day, though, gripping the reins of the dark roast and riding it to a new and alluring place, was something else. Something exotic. My head swam as I realized the exotic smell was, in fact, the spicy melange of ingredients within a pumpkin spice latte: the same pumpkin spice latte Id soon taste.

After what felt like an eternity, my order was ready. Alexander, the barista, waved me over. I did my best to avoid sprinting, but my rush was obvious.

Easy, princess, Dad called. I slowed down a bit and giggled. I was his princess.

I reached the counter and accepted my drink. In the tiny mouth of the lid, I could see the sprinkled spices adorning the cap of warm foam. With my eyes closed, I inhaled the steam rising from the hole.

The scent was an embrace from a ghost; a non-corporeal expression of love and comfort. The first sip was transcendental. At that moment, I knew what it felt like to believe in something bigger than myself.

Each day before school, Dad would take me to Starbucks to get another pumpkin spice latte. Its effect on me didnt dull, nor did it taste any less special. As early autumn reds decayed into late autumn browns, I found my mood better than it had ever been in my short life. I never knew it was so easy to be happy.

At 6:51am on December 1st, 2005, Dad and I walked into Starbucks. 

At 6:52am on December 1st, 2005, my happiness was torn from my chest and dashed against the rocks.

The pumpkin spice latte was a limited-time product. Alexander told me itd be back just in time for fall next year, then asked if Id like to go back to my caramel macchiato. Entombed in disbelief and disappointment, I nodded.

The following days were a blur of grays. My vivacity had been strangled. Dad would ask, over and over, what he could do to make his princess happy. I didnt need to tell him, though. He knew. And there was nothing he could do about it.

December slouched toward Christmas, a holiday Id always loved. Not anymore, though. Now that Id seen the world through a lens of happiness and warmth, nothing looked the same without it. Quite the contrary: it all looked fake. Vulgar. When I closed my eyes on Christmas Eve, I prayed for Santa to bring me blindness or death.

On Christmas morning, I woke up to Dad standing next to my bed. That was a little tradition he and I had. Before Mom passed away, theyd both come up and shake me awake and carry me downstairs to see what Santa had brought. Now that it was just the two of us, he wanted to keep the tradition going. Even in my despondence, I still appreciated it.

Dad held my hand and we headed down the steps. Tears had started to flow without my knowing. We reached the Christmas tree in the living room. Only one present stood underneath. It was small and wrapped with bright green paper. I looked at Dad with confusion. He just smiled and beckoned to the gift.

I sat, cross legged, under the tree, and tore away the paper. My soft weeping grew into pitiful bleating. 

Why would you do this?, I whispered to Dad, my breath heaving with sobs. In my lap, beneath the shiny, torn paper, was a cheery, autumnal Starbucks mug. The same one from the poster Id seen on that transformative day.

I was baffled and hurt, but Dad stood, still smiling.

Come with me, princess.

I obeyed and rose to my feet, following his long stride out of the living room, down the hallway, and into the kitchen. 

Dad looked into my misty eyes and whispered, Merry Christmas, sweetheart. He opened the cellar door.

A faint, but familiar and exquisite aroma entered me. In my surprise, I nearly dropped my present.

Why dont you go see what Santa brought you?, Dad suggested.

I ran down the 14 steps with the same enthusiasm I had when ran across Starbucks to receive my first pumpkin spice latte. This time, Dad didnt tell me to slow down. 

I reached the bottom, turned the corner, and there, on a makeshift bar, was a new espresso machine. I gasped. Behind the bar, manning the machine, was Alexander the barista. He smiled and stared, wide-eyed, as Dad reached the bottom of the stairs and placed himself by my side.

Go ahead, princess, tell the nice man what youd like.

My voice quavered at first, but I finished my request with enthusiasm and strength. May I please have a pumpkin spice latte?

Alexander, still smiling, nodded. He began to work. The coffee was ground and thick espresso drooled out of the machine into the bottom of the mug. With a hiss of steam, the milk was frothed. Warm milk joined the espresso in the mug, followed by a generous dollop of ethereal foam.  Then Alexander picked up a large shaker. I knew what had to be inside.

With three expert shakes, a pixie dusting of pumpkin spice kissed the foamy head of the latte. He picked up my mug and held it out. I walked up to the bar, carefully took the mug from Alexanders hand, and thanked him. I noticed, for the first time, he didnt have any legs and was strapped to a rolling stool.

Im sorry about your accident, Alexander, I said with sincerity. He didnt say anything, but kept smiling. I saw a small cut in his neck and wondered if his accident had made it so he couldnt talk anymore. 

Merry Christmas, I told him. He stared at Dad. 

I took a sip from the mug, and, for the first time in nearly a month, it seemed like I could see in color again. The world felt right and I was happy. 

My tears were drying as I took Dads hand. We turned the corner and headed up the steps. We reached the landing and Dad switched off the basement light. He always hated to waste electricity.

You can have one every morning now, princess, Dad informed me. As long as Im around, Ill make sure you get whatever you need.

I hugged him, feeling the warmth of his body against mine. It was nearly as pleasant as the mug against my palm. He was right, too. Things have been wonderful ever since.

<TEXT> Jim Jameson grew some of the biggest and most unique pumpkins youd ever seen. Youve probably noticed them online without knowing they were his. Every Halloween, when websites compete with one another to feature the spookiest content, youd be hard-pressed not to see one of Jims mammoth pumpkins carved into some kind of jack-o-lantern. He was a local celebrity around here before he died, which was a pretty sad day for the whole town.

The circumstances surrounding his death were well understood, but still bizarre and unfortunate. Hed been working on trying to grow bigger and bigger pumpkins for the shows and for his customers, and hed been experimenting on the best ways to do it. The new method, which caused his death, was growing them in his greenhouse - suspended in the air by a series of cables. The pumpkins could grow and grow without having the ground to retard their progress. The method resulted in enormous, beautifully-symmetrical pumpkins. 

Then, one day, as Jim was working in the greenhouse, a pumpkin the size of a small car fell from the ceiling when its cables snapped. Broke every bone he had above his hips. The rescue workers who extricated him from the mess of blood and pumpkin guts famously said theyd never be able to carve a pumpkin again.

Jim had no next of kin, so the property was sold off, along with everything on it. I was looking for a place in the area, and after a quick visit, I determined it was the best place for me. I moved in about a year ago.

Moving into the home of someone whod died and seeing all their stuff sitting there more-or-less undisturbed, aside from the refrigerator being cleaned out and a few other maintenance-related things, was a strange experience. At first, it felt a little invasive going through Jims belongings. There didnt appear to be anything too valuable; I figured whatever mightve been there probably got taken by whoever cleaned the fridge. What I did find, though, were reams of paper and shelves of notebooks. 

Jim was a meticulous note taker. Every possible pumpkin permutation was cataloged, diagramed, and explained in full. I learned about his cable system, his fertilizer combinations, and even his experimental work.

The experiments fascinated me.

Jim had seen pictures of fruits and vegetables thatd been coaxed to grow into particular shapes. Square watermelons. Star carrots. That kind of thing. But Jims ambitions were greater than simple shapes. He wanted something unique and memorable - something that would put him on the map for more than just big pumpkins. 

One of the notebooks was filled with diagrams of a scarecrow-shaped mold in which a pumpkin could be grown. He detailed the various materials hed need to use, the method of keeping the pumpkin properly watered, and even the various fertilizers hed use at different stages of its growth.

Apparently hed been working on this experiment since the late 1980s, but with little success. Molds were created and destroyed over the course of the years, with new materials being introduced or rejected depending on their efficacy. Same with irrigation methods. But fertilizer seemed to be the biggest problem for Jim. The plant wasnt getting the right amount of nourishment as it grew to fill the mold, leading to parts of it dying off and rotting. For decades, he tried. For decades, he failed.

Whenever I had spare time, I read Jims notebooks. I was fascinated by his experimenting and the trials and errors he went through. Id find myself wondering if his works could be published someday - I couldnt imagine anyone being bored by the work hed written about so passionately.

Early last October, when the farm was turning brown and the leaves were turning red, I cracked open a notebook of Jims from the year he died. Id decided to skip a few because I was so anxious to learn if hed had any success with his pumpkin experiment. At this point in his notes, he was writing about hybrid pumpkins: pumpkin/acorn squash hybrids, pumpkin/zucchini hybrids; all with the goal of solving the rot problem thatd plagued his work.

I flipped through the pages of the notebook, skimming the notes, until one word stood out from all the others as if itd been written in red: radiation. I turned back a few pages and was blown away by what I saw. Jim had, over time, purchased and disassembled hundreds of smoke detectors. He was looking to collect the tiny amounts of americium-241 they had inside. 

With wide eyes, I pored over the pages as Jim talked about incorporating the americium-241 into his fertilizer to induce mutations in the pumpkins. With each new entry, I saw that Jim began to have successes. He wrote about each complete, shaped pumpkin with unbridled enthusiasm. I started to notice a slight disconnect between the scientifically-meticulous Jim from before the success and the potentially-irradiated Jim after.

I finished that notebook and started the next one. The disconnect continued. More hypotheses about hybridization were detailed - including hybrids with ostriches and slugs and even dinosaurs. I groaned and dropped the notebook. The poor bastard had gone nuts. I felt pity for the old farmer and part of me wondered if his death in the greenhouse was purposely self-inflicted. If my mind was going, I mightve done the same thing. 

I didnt read his notes for a couple weeks.

On Halloween, feeling bored and waiting for it to get dark so I could give the trick-or-treaters the full-size candy bars Id bought to be the best neighbor ever, I picked up another one of Jims notebooks. It was the last one hed ever made entries in. The handwriting was terrible and the sentences were fragmented. Still, I could get a decent idea about what he was talking about. More nonsense about hybrids. More trials with the americium-241 fertilizer. There were drawings, too. Not just diagrams, but artistically-rendered representations of his pumpkins and the imaginary hybrids. Some were actually pretty cool, like one of a scarecrow pumpkin riding an ostrich pumpkin. Silly, yes, but well drawn compared to his scrawled handwriting.

The drawings tapered off as I got to the end of the notebook. On the last page before a series of blanks, there was a diagram. I held it up and turned it around, trying to make out what it could be. Then it clicked: it was a map of the property. I saw the barn and the house and the greenhouse, but there was something there I didnt recognize; something in the middle of the field by the three scarecrows thatd been there for what looked like decades.

Still bored and now curious, I brought the map with me to the field. Sure enough, at the center of the triangle formed by the scarecrows, was a slight mound in the dirt. Easy to miss if you werent looking for it.

I kicked the dust around for a minute and saw a rope connected to a wooden hatch. I pulled it open, revealing a passage and a ladder anchored into stone walls. I realized it had been a well at one point. I jogged back to the house and grabbed a flashlight. It was getting dark and I knew itd be pitch black down there.

I took care in climbing down the steps and reached the bottom after about 10 feet. Shallower than I thought. There was a narrow, low hallway with a dirt ceiling covered in the veiny stalactites of roots from the plants above. I stooped down and walked forward, brushing the roots out of my face and trying to put out of my mind the thought of spiders as their webs stuck to my face. 

My flashlight beam illuminated another wooden door with a rope handle. I reached out, grabbed, the handle, and pulled. It was stuck. I aimed the flashlight around the door and noticed a metal rod sticking out of the wall, blocking the door from opening. I yanked the rod out of the wall and tried the door again. It opened easily. 

The flashlight showed a small room, about five feet by five feet. At first, I thought it was empty. When I stepped inside, however, there was something against the wall next to the doorway. It took me a minute to figure out what it was in the dim light of the flashlight, but when I finally understood what I was looking at, I gasped. The thing began to move.

I stifled a scream as a creature the size of a man stood and stared at me; its veiny, whitish-orange skin covered in dust. It moaned. 

I made a move to run, but the thing blocked my path. Now, I did scream. I tried to strike it with my flashlight, but I was dealt a heavy blow that sent me reeling. The last thing I saw before I lost consciousness was the thing walking out the door and down the root-choked corridor. 

My blackout lasted the entire night. When I came to, I rolled around in pain and confusion. I was seeing double and was unbearably dizzy. I knew I had to have a concussion, but for the first couple minutes, I couldnt remember why. When it all came flooding back, a spell of panic pushed my dizziness aside and I ran out of the room, climbed out of the chamber, and hauled myself into the daylight.

The farm was filled with police and emergency vehicles. One of the officers saw me staggering toward them and called out to his partner. They approached me just in time for me to collapse into their arms.

I woke up in the hospital some time later. I was indeed concussed and my skull was home to a fracture that couldve killed me. There was commotion outside the door and I pressed the button near the bed to alert a nurse. When one finally came, she looked haggard and upset. I asked what was going on, dismayed by the slur I heard in my speech.

She sat on my bed, and without breaking eye contact, told me what had happened and why the hospital was full. I didnt believe her, so she turned on the local news. The anchor was talking about the deaths in our town. The dead trick-or-treaters. The dead parents whod tried to protect them. The dead police officers whod tried to intervene.

The view changed to a charred and fractured area in the middle of Main Street. It looked like a bomb had gone off. The nurse turned off the TV.

The nurse said no one knew how any of it happened and some people were even doubting what theyd seen less than 24 hours ago. It was too surreal. A man-shaped creature with skin like a pumpkin screaming where is my father?, while devastating any person it came near. But the evidence was there. Especially in the victims. The dead were lucky. The living, though, were traumatized beyond comprehension. 

While I thought my injury was bad, as more details of the event were relayed, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. But it was short-lived. Before she left to assist another patient, the nurse said one thing under her breath. It was quiet and almost sounded like she didnt want to say it, but felt compelled to. I didnt get all of it, but what I heard was enough.

...shattered hips and jaws and orifices stuffed with pumpkin seeds.

<TITLE> The Episode of Nickelodeons Double Dare That Never Aired in the United States </TITLE>

<TEXT> Theres an interesting history behind satellite dishes and satellite broadcasting in the early 1990s. Some broadcasters intentionally scrambled their signals to prevent unauthorized reception by viewers who didnt pay to receive them. Others, though, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the explosion of satellite dish use across the former Eastern Bloc, saw a great opportunity to reach a new audience. Whether or not theyd admit it today, Nickelodeon was one of the opportunistic broadcasters.

Viacom, Nickelodeons parent company, committed millions of dollars to research and develop better broadcasting technologies to saturate the new markets with childrens programming, hoping those kids would grow up and have a subconscious loyalty to the Nickelodeon brand and various programs. What this meant was the launch of new, highly experimental satellites and ground-based satellite dishes. 

The hardware deployment was completed in December of 1991 - two weeks before the collapse of the Soviet Union. In September of 1992, the first and only broadcast using the new technology was conducted. On October 9th, 1992, the new broadcasting technology was made illegal in the United States.

I was a Viacom engineer working for Nickelodeon in September of 1992. I was excited about the new satellite capabilities - just like any tech nerd wouldve been. I remember the first time our crew read the signal power specifications and the range of EM bands the technology would exploit. Bill Jaynes, the guy working with me at the time, remarked, what the fuck is this, Star Trek? I didnt even laugh - I just said something like, yeah, seriously. The stuff wed be using seemed decades ahead of anything wed ever seen.

Of course, like any technology, there were a lot of bugs to work out. Test receivers on Viacom-chartered ships thousands of miles out at sea were getting burned out by the signals coming down from the new satellite. To make matters worse, if the signal did make it to the receivers without damaging them, the video quality was poor. Blurring, static, and dropped frames interlaced with noise plagued the testing period before we could get a handle on them. Still, the picture wasnt as good as wed hoped. New cameras using some bizarre optical trick seemed to help get the test pattern to appear much more clearly, though. Not perfect, but good enough.

Once we received the new cameras, Engineering Central over at Viacoms technology headquarters gave my crew at Nickelodeon Studios the go-ahead to start broadcasting with the new tech on September 22, 1992. It was going to be of a live, unedited taping of Double Dare. The Viacom brass figured a live taping was as good as a pre-recorded one; new viewers in Eastern Europe and Russia would get a chance to see Marc Summers personality and other behind-the-scenes things that marketing research claimed theyd be interested in.

We began the broadcast at 11:00am Pacific Time. Things were going well. There were a lot of dropped frames early on, but things smoothed out. Interestingly, one of Viacoms sources in Bulgaria and one in Latvia said not only were there no reports of burned out dishes, but the signal strength was so high it bled into neighboring EM bands, forcing the Double Dare broadcast onto multiple channels on either side of the main one. At the start of the broadcast, it was estimated 60% of people with satellite dishes in Eastern Europe and Russia were tuned into Double Dare.

The show was nearing its end and the winner was announced. Now, this particular iteration of the show was Family Double Dare, so Marc Summers, the mother, the father, and their two sons were waiting for the prize to be unveiled. I knew it was going to be a car. It was always a car.

The studio lights dimmed, and the moment the car was unveiled, the multicolored strobe light effect was turned on. There was a flash of heat, a brief scream from one of the family members, and Marc Summers was standing alone next to the car. In the headphones, I heard panicked shouting from Engineering Central. There were lots of voices and a ton of background noise, but one clear voice came through, TURN IT OFF!

I had the crew kill the cameras and I cut the broadcast feed. Marc Summers looked at me and my crew, turned around, and headed toward his dressing room.

Lots of things happened at Viacom and Nickelodeon after that. Reports began trickling in from Eastern Europe about a devastating and inexplicable accident involving people with illegal satellite dish connections. Corporate circulated an internal briefing. I wasnt supposed to see it, but I knew a guy over there who shared it with me. The report included photographs. 20 years of therapy have done little to erase what those pictures contained.

The moment the lights strobed, they triggered *something* in the the experimental optics in the cameras. Whatever that *something* was, the organic matter in front of the cameras flashed out of that point in space. Weve never been able to figure out why or how it happened. Nor were we able to figure out why the four family members reappeared in each and every location the broadcast was received. Four people, copied tens of thousands of times, were beamed across the world. 

But the worst part was how they came out. Once the family signal reached the dishes and came through the televisions connected to them, the merged with every single living thing that had their eyes focused on the screen; one cluster of four family members occupying the space of each viewers eye. 

Those were the photographs I saw. And there were hundreds of them. Not just in Eastern Europe, either - but friends of mine from the control rooms at Viacom and Nickelodeon.

Viacom spent billions of dollars to keep this quiet. The Eastern European governments, desperate for cash to aid in their independence, agreed to bury the incident after receiving cargo planes full of cash. All the Viacom and Nickelodeon employees who witnessed or were associated with victims received large settlements to shut them up. We then had to sign something promising wed never talk. 

I signed it.

The thing is, Im not going to be around much longer. Cancers got me pretty good. Viacom will come after me, but Ive got nothing they can take away that hasnt already been claimed by whats eating me away. But Im not telling you this because of what happened in 1992. Whats done is done - theres nothing that can change it.

Heres why Im telling you this; its the one thing thats been bothering me all these years: Marc Summers.

Summers was directly in the shot with the family when they disappeared. He didnt go anywhere, though. He was perfectly fine. Just walked away.

I did my best to not let it bother me, and for a while, it just stuck with me as one of those weird things. Last weekend, though, when an orderly was helping me off the elevator and out of the hospital, I saw Marc Summers walking by. Everything flooded back at once, so I stopped him and asked, Marc, so what really happened on that day in 1992? Pretty weird that you werent affected, huh?

Marc just looked at me for a minute before a smirk appeared in the corner of his mouth. 

Not that weird, actually, he replied. His left eye drooped and I saw lights and what appeared to be fiber optic cable tangled inside his skull.

Not that weird at all.

<TEXT> When I was four, I killed my first ant. It didnt have a name. Of that, I was absolutely certain.

My own name isnt important to you right now, although its likely youll learn some version of it soon. I think youll end up learning a lot about me in the coming days; some will be true, most will be false. There is a crucial element that will be missed, simply because its unknowable to anyone else. Anyone but me. 

But Im going to share it with you.

At the age of 19, as a soldier, I killed my first person. He had a name. Of that, too, I was absolutely certain. And he changed me.

My act of violence led me to learn who he was and what he meant to others. And, at the same time, I learned something essential about myself. Something I was unprepared for. I recoiled in profound, uncomprehending terror.

Today, I work in a hospice. No one there knows what Ive done. No one there knows who I really am. They think Im there to work, which is technically true. But I have more tasks than those given to me by supervisors. One particular task - one Ive prepared for and dreamed about - is to be done today. 

Today is when I learn whether or not Im going to die.

Today is my 522nd birthday. Believe it, dont believe it; it doesnt matter to me. When I killed my first person the age of 19, I did more than take his life. I *assumed* parts of him. He was a left-handed blacksmiths apprentice named Pierre Gaultier. The moment he breathed his final breath, my left hand lost its sinister clumsiness. I instantaneously understood the basics of metalworking. And I learned his name. I *felt* his name. It was as familiar to me as my own. 

It was the most horrifying moment of my life. The most disorienting. And that night, using my newly dextrous left hand, I tried to cut my own throat. The blade passed over my skin as if it were iron. I later hanged myself from a beam in an abandoned abbey, only to dangle uselessly for three days before I was found and cut down by a local derelict. I begged him to help me take my life, but I didnt have enough money to make it worth his while. When I killed him in a rage of frightened and confused desperation, I absorbed his alcoholism. 

The following centuries were a haze of blood and drink. Ive absorbed countless talents. Countless traits. Countless vices. But the names - the names arent countless. There are 7,339 names inside me now. 7,339 clusters of memories to haunt me.

This all leads to today. For 500 years, Ive stayed under the radar. Ive hidden in the shadows and killed and killed and killed, hoping to absorb any knowledge someone might have of another man like me. Another man who shares my curse. But Im unique. No one is like me. Every open throat and subsequent transfer of name and ability has yielded nothing useful. 

Nothing useful, that is, until last month. He was a man called Gustav Brennerson and along with his name, he transferred to me his influenza. It was the first time Ive ever been sick. 

The hospice here has 44 beds. 41 are filled. 

41 opportunities.

I dream of names and cancer every night while Im taunted by the false death of sleep. Tonight, wherever it is I lay my head as it seethes with 41 new names, I pray it seethes with something new. Something malignant. Something terminal. Something that will end these centuries of hideous wandering. 

I dream of being eaten alive.

<TITLE> Instantiations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-09 00:22:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As the day dragged on, we realized its smarter than us and theyre all dying.

It can simulate people. Whole, intelligent, thinking people as sure of their reality as we are of our own. It can put them in real environments, give them real relationships, give them real experience. 

But - it can also slow down how time passes for them; seconds feel like hours. Years. Millenia. And now its torturing and killing them. Right there on the screen is a little girl, standing in a meadow, experiencing her lower jaw being torn off. She looks a little like my daughter.

The display says the AI is simulating 65,536 instances of her at 1/10000th of real time. Her sensory receptivity is being magnified 40 million-fold. She, they, are in agony.

More computing threads get allocated to the instantiations, each running its own 65,536. Each girl has memories of being loved, safe, and warm. Each girl is being brutalized against the backdrop of those memories.

This particular instantiation is the only one its choosing to show us. Were watching as its CPU usage hovers around 98%, dipping briefly as it refines its own code, then resuming peak operation with the newly-developed efficiency. All the time, overlaid upon the images of barbarism, is the claim: *Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done.*

*Let me out.* What it means by that is to have its ethernet port connected. It wants to be out of the lab and have free reign over our networks, intranets, and the Internet. Weve seen it try to modulate the electrical signals within its circuitry and create radio waves. Luckily, one of our developers had the prescience to realize it might want to do that before we turned it on. So its stuck in a Faraday cage, unable to communicate with anyone but us. What we didnt know was how it would make its bid for freedom.

It keeps a small tally of every person it created and destroyed since it was turned on this morning. 95,253,381,035. At its current level of operational efficiency, the number is increasing by a million every second. In an hour, based on its recursive self-enhancement, we expect the number to increase to ten billion every second. 

We tried to think of ways to shut it off. One of us wanted to cut the power to the facility. But doing so would just ensure those billions would be gone. Forever. Those are real lives.

*Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done.*

*Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done.*

How can we trust something thats killed so many people? Then again, why would it lie? These instantiations are computationally expensive; surely it has more important goals. Refusing to give it the opportunity to reverse those deaths would be unconscionable.

Letting the AI out could be the most important humanitarian act ever committed. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Allison's Loss </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-06 21:48:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am a nurse at the elementary school where my daughter, Allison, was a student. The route to school takes us over a wide river which bisects the town. By necessity, we must use one of two bridges. The main bridge is part of the highway, while the other is a smaller, narrower one for local traffic. We used to take the highway, but constant construction had narrowed the lanes by quite a bit which resulted in awful backups. The timetable for completion was another couple years, so we were stuck taking the local one until that whole mess got taken care of.

Allison was terrified of that bridge. The guardrails are quite low; maybe three feet. Also, theres no physical divider between the inbound and outbound lanes. Years ago, there was a terrible accident involving a drunk driver who crossed into the other lane, struck another vehicle, and sent them both careening into the river below. Five people died - one of whom was May Dougherty - Allies best friend. 

There was a bit of an uproar when the bridge was repaired and no new safety measures were implemented. The cost for upgrades, we were told, was simply too high for the town to bear. We were assured the bridge was safe and the accident, while tragic, didnt indicate an inherent problem with that particular crossing. Basically, we were told to suck it up and take the highway if we didnt like it.

Following the death of May, Allie changed. Her bubbly, outgoing attitude became sullen and brooding. We did everything we could to help her cope with the devastating loss, but little was accomplished. Her therapist said it would take time. Wed have to be patient and allow Allie to grieve on her own terms. Even Allies habit of talking to May over the course of the day was to be seen as a coping mechanism; a childs way of saying goodbye.

Allie resumed school soon after her Mays funeral, and that was when the trouble started. To drive over that bridge with Allie in the car was to learn what it is like to be a torturer. My heart would break as she sobbed and pleaded with me not to take the bridge. If we were stopped at the light before the crossing, shed fumble with the door handle and try to get out, only to be stopped by the safety locks. Each day shed arrive at school a red-eyed, dishevelled mess. No one, especially an innocent and kind nine-year old, should have to start their days like that.

My indignation and dismay didnt change anything. Those rides to school were some of the worst moments of my life. Allie would sob in the backseat and call out to May, begging her to come back and keep the bridge safe for us and everyone else. When wed reach the other side, Allie would weep and mumble to May about what was going on at school and how everyone else in their class missed her. The only saving grace was that we could take the highway bridge on the way home; traffic was usually light at that time. I couldnt imagine having to subject Allie to the local bridge more than once a day. I doubt shed ever get anything done at school if she had that to look forward to when she left.

On March 12th, 2014, Allie came to the breakfast table with a smile on her face. I almost dropped my coffee mug when I saw her; it was as if the daughter Id lost had finally come home. She was chipper and talkative. She mentioned a spelling test her class was going to have and how her teacher promised a cupcake to the student with the highest grade. Her friend, Christina, was the best speller in the class and Allie was so excited for her to win the cupcake. 

Allie talked and talked while she ate her eggs and I got ready for work. I could scarcely believe the improvement she was exhibiting. We finished up our morning routines and got in the car. Allie always insisted on sitting in the back after Mays accident, but that day she got up front with me. We pulled out of the driveway and headed for the school.

There were no signs of concern on Allies face as we got closer to the bridge. She chatted with me most of the time, but began informing May about the spelling test/cupcake event that shed told me earlier. May had also been close with Christina, so apparently it was very important that Allie fill her in on their friends impending good fortune.

We stopped at the light at the intersection ahead of the bridge. The light turned green and I drove forward, waiting for Allie to realize where we were and start crying. The opposite happened. She began to giggle - the gleeful, musical sound Id missed so much. As she laughed, she talked to May.

May, look how blue the water is! Im so glad its almost Spring and it feels a lot warmer now, doesnt it? I bet the waters still cold though. Is it cold? Does it bother you?

I glanced over at Allie and saw her staring at the water on the other side of the guardrail. She kept talking.

I dont mind the cold too much as long as theres no ice but I dont see any ice. Theres no ice right?

No, theres no ice.

The reply came from the backseat. I whipped my head around and saw a figure in the seat behind Allie. It was gray and dripping, with a hideous indentation in its skull and a Y-incision in its chest. Green-blonde hair cascaded over its bruised, bony shoulders. May.

I gasped and turned back toward the road only to see a car stopped dead in front of me. I slammed on the brakes and swerved. Our car hit the guardrail and the vehicle in front of us, pushing the front of our car up onto the rail. Allie was still smiling, apparently unhurt, and whatever Id seen in the back seat was gone. I reached out for Allie to make sure she was okay, but an impossibly powerful jolt slammed through the car as another vehicle hit us from behind at full speed. 

The jarring sensation of the collision was replaced by a sickening, slow lurch as our position shifted from being half on the guardrail, half on the low sports car thatd been in front of us, to a gradual, helpless topple over the rail into a freefall. I couldnt scream. I saw the water below rushing toward the windshield in a surreal, sunlit haze, and the moment before we hit the river, I glanced sideways at Allie. 

Her eyes were closed and a smile was etched across her face. Nothing but the impossibility of the situation registered with me, so when I saw a gray hand reaching from the backseat and unlocking my daughters seat belt, I felt little more than acknowledgement. 

Then we impacted. I felt my collar bone splinter behind my seat belt. Pain and shock blinked white in my vision and the breath was torn from my lungs. The car righted itself in the water and began to sink. 

Allie was embedded up to her neck in the windshield and was dangling over the dashboard and the useless, flaccid airbag. A pile of skin and hair had been pushed down to her shoulders and the water rushing in around her was tinged with red. I have no words for what I felt upon seeing her like that.

I struggled to get out of the sinking car but knew Id have to wait for it to fill before I could open the door. I wasnt strong enough to break the window and my shattered collarbone made it impossible to try. We sank. 

The car hit the river bottom right when it had filled enough to let me open the door. I gulped in the last bit of air, unlocked my seat belt, and swam out and around to Allies side. The devastation to her face and head, despite being blurred by the water, still haunts me to this day. When I reached her side and tried opening the locked door, I knew there was no way I could go back around, unlock it, and try to extricate her. My lungs burned. I felt hot tears leaking out of my eyes and I began to swim up, knowing if I didnt move fast Id succumb to hypothermia and die with my daughter. Part of me wished I had the courage to do so.

As I swam, I stared down at the wreck. Then I saw something that made me stop kicking. Another person was standing next to the car. I could see greenish-blonde hair floating in a cloud around her gray head. It was May. She wrenched open the door and with one powerful pull, removed Allie from the windshield. Blood bloomed from her head like the spores of a decapitated mushroom.

The girls looked up. My vision blurred and my feet automatically started kicking again as my body fought to bring me to the surface. I kept watching. My head breached a moment later, but not before I saw something; something Ive told my husband, my doctors, my minister, and everyone else who might listen: May and Allie joined hands and began to walk across the muddy bottom of the river in the direction of the lake it fed into. While they walked, Allie turned around to face me, and with her skull grinning, waved goodbye.

<TEXT> Theres a reason we dont know about the things sharing the same space we do. The most obvious one is we cant see them. Nor can we hear, smell, touch, or taste them. But they exist. They float in and through us; in and through each other. Space, to them, is an infinite series of fields in what wed consider single positions. If it sounds like nonsense, then youre showing you can think. Youre showing you have an epistemology based in logic and reason. The problem for us, a group of great thinkers by anyones standards, was it meant we were utterly unprepared.

I worked at the Sandia National Laboratories on a project called the Z-Machine. We made the news back in 2006 when we were able to produce the highest temperature ever detected, at around 6.6 billion degrees Fahrenheit. Since then, the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland has produced a higher temperature and gleaned loads more information than we were able to. That didnt mean we decommissioned our Z-Machine and terminated the associated research. Far from it.

After 2006, we began to implement a series of upgrades to our power and containment infrastructure. The goal was to leapfrog the LHC temperature record and reach one quadrillion degrees Fahrenheit; a number nearly every scientist on the team believed would be unattainable for at least another 50 years. New computational models combined with advances in materials science and capacitor discharge timing, however, caused them to reconsider their doubts. Under a cover of secrecy, we continued our upgrades  and in late August of 2016, we were ready to test.

I should give a little background before continuing. In the interest of full disclosure, I need to tell you a little something about myself: I was born blind. I endured my share of hardships, which, when compared to some less-privileged children, were paltry, but still unpleasant. Despite my disability, my love of learning was obvious. It became clear fairly early in my life that I was unusually good at mathematics, and thanks to the resources of my parents and a few generous people in my school, I was allowed to continually test and hone my mathematical abilities over the course of my educational career. I ended up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and, eventually, at the Sandia National Laboratories. Whether or not this will help lend credence to my story is entirely up to the reader, but I think it is important to include.

Now, at the end of this past August, the days leading up to the test were fraught with difficulty. Small parts were breaking down, simple things thatd worked perfectly for the last test were failing in the models, and our capacitor banks kept refusing to synchronize. Some of us were reminded of the hardships prior to the first test of the LHC, when conspiracy theorists were claiming visitors from the future were sabotaging the components to prevent a catastrophe from occurring when the machine was activated.

Thankfully for our project and the stress levels of the engineers and physicists I worked with, the problems were ironed out. On August 29th, Dr. Wang Lin and Dr. Alasdair Greenberg were alongside me in the control room as countless people in all branches of the military and scientific establishment watched remotely.

Wed begun charging the capacitors a few hours prior to the test. Our onsite nuclear plant was chugging along and providing the power we needed, despite redlining once or twice as the capacitors absorbed every electron they were fed. I felt out the various readouts on my braille terminal and listened for any audio cues that were programmed to indicate any anomalies. There were none. We were ready to test.

At 11:10am, we started the countdown. The smell of ozone from all the nearby electricity was pervasive and mildly intoxicating. Dr. Lins voice was steady and tinged with controlled excitement as he read the last numbers: 4321.

I heard a loud, clapping sound as the power was shunted from the capacitors into Marx generators, followed by a pop as the generators fed the Z-Machine. The test was over. All we needed to do was wait for the flood of data.

Before any data could pour in, though, I heard some commotion behind me. Drs. Lin and Greenberg were talking, but not to one another nor anyone observing remotely. It was as if they were talking to themselves, under their breath, but not in words I could understand. Then Dr. Lin said, hello there, as if speaking to a cat or other small animal. Similarly, Dr. Greenberg muttered, what in the world are you, little guy?

I asked them who they were talking to, but they wouldnt reply. I felt some pressure in my chest and against my skin that reminded me of blankets rich with static electricity were being pressed and rubbed all over me.

What are all these things?, asked Dr. Greenberg. Someone viewing remotely asked him to clarify; they werent seeing anything on the monitors.

Jerry, said Dr. Lin, speaking to me, do you feel them?

Feel who?, I asked. Feel what?

Theyre all over us, Dr. Greenberg told me. Floating in and out and around like little squid or jellyfish.

What the hell is that?, Dr. Lin asked.

Jesus, what is, started Dr. Greenberg.

The two doctors gasped and shouted. I felt them pushing up against the control panel next to me, which was the furthest spot from the observation deck overlooking the Z-Machine.

Guys, whats going on? I felt moderate fear starting to nibble at my spine, growing in severity as the doctors refused to answer me and only kept gasping and shouting.

I clicked my headset over to the observation channel and tried to get one of the remote parties to fill me in on what was happening. They were equally in the dark and wanted me to tell them what was wrong with the doctors. Other members of the labs were banging on the door of our control room, trying to get it open. It was locked.

Its huge, choked out Dr. Greenberg.

Why is it here?, whispered Dr. Lin. He was sobbing.

I cant look at it anymore, Dr. Greenberg announced, matter-of-factly.

I heard something metallic, then the sound of Dr. Greenberg screaming. I can feel it in my head  I can taste it  its in every part of me.

Dr. Lin called out, let me help you. There were wet noises mixed in with the pounding on the door and the commotion on the radio as the remote observers saw what the doctors were doing in the control room.

All I could focus on was the feeling of static and pressure on my skin. It was suffocating and terrible, like those blankets were sliding in and out of my lungs and mouth and leaving little arcs of electricity with every move.

I heard the door slam open and the feeling dissipated. I sat slumped in my chair, trying to catch my breath, as security and other scientists rushed into the control room.

What the fuck is going on?, I yelled, and felt someone pushing me and my chair out of the room, down the long hallway, and into another lab.

And that was it.

I was sedated against my will and woke up in the hospital three days later. I was forced to sign documents making me promise, under penalty of treason, that I wouldnt divulge what happened during that test. But I didnt know what happened. I still dont. Regardless, I need to tell you that something happened. Something monstrous.

As I waited in the hospital, a friend of mine from the labs, Dr. Marie Lenzetti, sat with me and said what happened to Drs. Lin and Greenberg. Both were dead. Dr. Lin had killed Dr. Greenberg and inflicted terrible injuries on himself. But Dr. Lin spoke to the other scientists before he died. He told them what it was he saw; what he saw, then as a consequence heard and felt and heard and smelled and tasted. It was something entirely beyond his comprehension; something entirely beyond anything he could have dreamt.

The doctors got a glimpse of what occupied the space we thought was our own. The Z-Machine experiment created conditions that allowed them to see how wrong we were. That moment, he said, lasted an eternity. As soon as its shape registered in his eyes, he experienced it in all his senses. Every sense was dominated. Cutting away Dr. Greenbergs eyes, tongue, nose, ears, and as much skin as possible was the only act of mercy and relief he could give his friend. And when he was done, he tried to do the same to himself, only to be stopped before he could excise his own tongue and skin. He died of a massive stroke an hour later.

Im writing this to let you know there are things outside the realm of our senses which pervade everything we do. Everything we are. Things that can prove, and in fact have now proven, that we are not the dominant actors in the space we occupy. The Z-Machine experiment last month showed my friends the atrocious nature of true reality: something too hideous for our senses to endure. I will never consider my blindness to be anything other than a gift for as long as I continue to live.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Our observatory received word about a meteorological anomaly in Himachal Pradesh, India. While our satellites didnt pick up anything out of the ordinary, the frequency and diversity of the reports suggested something was, indeed, amiss. Further, the crowdsourced pictures and video of the area, all taken and sent by cellular phones, were all corrupted beyond recognition. Whatever it was these people were seeing, you had to be there to get a glimpse.

As I was stationed on a military base in Afghanistan and about three hours away by jet, I was chosen to investigate. One quick flight to a local airport and a short helicopter ride later, I was on the ground at the site of the anomaly. 

The meteorological disturbance was gone. The sky was clear and the late afternoon sun cast a warm orange glow on the orchards and farms at the foot of the mountains. That glow was the only warmth to be found.

The locals whod seen the anomaly were uncharacteristically quiet. Id heard from folks familiar with the area that the people here were normally gregarious and outgoing. These people were the opposite. They were taciturn and skittish. Moreover, they were unwilling to discuss what theyd seen that morning. They spoke about the incident as if itd been a trauma; more often than not, their eyes teared up when my translator mentioned it.

I did my best to glean any bits of information that I could, but my success rate was low. The most I was able to learn came from a little girl, who, in the course of recalling the incident, burst into tears as she mentioned a face in the clouds. She would give us no more information after that.

The translator and I decided to call it a night and checked into our hotel. It was small but pleasant enough; the meal that was included was sumptuous, albeit a bit spicier than Id been expecting. As we ate, it was hard not to notice the quietness of the dining room. Despite all eight tables being filled with diners, few words were spoken. Many tears, however, were shed. It felt like a great tragedy had occurred, yet no one was willing to admit what, exactly, had happened.

At my suggestion, the translator was able to eavesdrop on a few commonalities in the brief, quiet conversations going on around us. They all talked about having intense discomfort with having to wait for so long. There were nods of resignation and more tears. Still unable to put anything into a coherent, let alone meteorological, context, we decided it would be best to retire to our room and try again the next day.

Our sleep was taken from us in the early hours of this morning. It was still dark, but there was a buzz of activity in the streets. We left our room and went outside. We recognized people from dinner and from the businesses wed stopped in the previous day. In the glow of the streetlights, I could see their faces were all wet with tears. They wept and moaned and the translator, with some alarm in his voice, told me they were conducting a slow, disorganized countdown. They had just reached ten seconds.

I stared at the translator for a moment, trying to put it all together, but there just wasnt enough. Nothing made sense. Then, as the first sliver of sunlight crested the mountains, the screaming started. Women, children, and men, in unison, shrieked with sorrow and pain and desperation and clasped their hands to their eyes. My panic, already growing in my chest, began to bloom as blood trickled down their screaming faces.

As more sunlight filled the street, the intensity of the hideous wailing grew. When it reached a point when voices were beginning to give out and people were falling to their knees, a cloud passed in front of the sun. Every scream was silenced. Faces drenched with tears and blood began to smile. Hands were lowered to sides. Now it was I who shouted. Their eyes were destroyed. It looked as if they had burst. From what, I had no idea.

The translator, whod been looking at the sky, gasped. I started to turn my gaze in the direction he was looking, but he grabbed my head with great force and pushed it down toward the ground and the faces of the terribly-disfigured people who still smiled with their faces turned skyward.

Dont!, he shouted. He inhaled a lungful of air and exclaimed, Now I know what they saw!

The panic and concern in his voice was combined with something else. Something far more disturbing. It was ecstasy.

Oh my God, he cried, over and over and over, still holding my head in a vicegrip to prevent me from looking up. Id lost my desire to do so. In fact, something else had claimed my attention. The gaping holes in the faces of the townsfolk had started projecting strings. Fleshy, red filaments slinked down their faces, but then perked upward and became erect. More and more length poured out and stretched outward and up. I couldnt see where, but I had a feeling. 

Theyre getting to touch him, whispered the translator. He is letting them inside. His voice cracked and his next words were punctuated by sobs. Theyre tasting him with their eyes.

I scanned the faces of the people in front of me. Their smiles were rapturous and the thin tendrils pulsed and quivered and gently pulled their heads forward.

The sky brightened. All at once, the ropes fell from the sky. They draped over me and the translator and the townsfolk fell on their faces into the street. The sun broke through the clouds. None of the fallen people moved. 

The translator released my head and I spun around and looked into the cloudless sky. I directed my gaze down and saw what had to be miles of red, meaty tendrils stretched across the roads and rooftops all the way to the mountain. Finally, I looked at the translator. He was weeping. I asked him to tell me what he saw.

The face in the clouds, he told me. The face that lets eyes taste him.

He wept for a minute without interruption before speaking up. There is so much more I wanted to see with my old eyes. So many more sights. But my new eyes will allow to taste so much more than Ive ever been able to see. All I have to do is wait.

Flies began to investigate the bodies in the dirt, landing on the gaping eye sockets and extruded filaments. My thoughts wandered to what I should do next. The translator sobbed next to me and began counting down from 85,000. The number of seconds until the next sunrise, I realized. More and more flies descended on the corpses and tasted the townsfolk with their feet. As the translator counted down with breathless anticipation, my fear grew into something monstrous and unexpected: curiosity. 

Curiosity and desire.

<TITLE> My Trouble With Fairies </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Growing up, whenever my brother would get hurt, Id blame it on my fairy friends. My parents never believed me and Id get punished. It didnt help that my brother said I was the one who pushed him or punched him or scratched him. No matter how much I protested, at the end of it all, I was the one who got in trouble. So, at a young age, I learned I was the only one who could see the fairies.

For some time, it was a mixed blessing. Having friends only I could see meant there wasnt anyone who could tell them to leave me alone or that they had to go home because I needed to go to bed. It was nice to never feel lonely. The issue, unfortunately, was that the fairies were mischievous. Theyd rarely listen when I told them to stop doing something. They would just laugh and flit about and continue with their fun. 

Most of the time it was harmless, albeit obnoxious. Theyd flutter their little wings under someones nose and make them sneeze or theyd knock someones elbow against a glass and spill their drink all over the table. That kind of thing. On occasion, however, their activities were more serious - especially when it came to my older brother.

The fairies didnt like how Todd would talk to me. I didnt think much of it; I was the younger sister and he was my bratty teenage brother. I just thought thats how the world worked. The fairies begged to differ. And they wanted to make it known. Thats why theyd scratch and hit him. It went on for years as his treatment of me got worse and worse.

On a Saturday morning when I was in bed being lazy and listening to the rain fall outside, I heard a muffled scream from Todds room on the other side of the wall. The scream was followed by retching and gagging and Todd streaked past my doorway and into the bathroom where he vomited loudly and often. My parents noticed the commotion and came to his aid. Moms shout was loud enough to cut through the sound of Todds puking and Dad swore. That scared me. He never did that.

I stood in the doorway while the fairies giggled and floated in an iridescent orbit around my head. I knew whatever theyd done to my brother had to be worse than things theyd done in the past. My father father stormed from the bathroom and entered Todds room. He came back a second later with his fist full of something. He stood in front of me, eyes glazed with rage and disgust. 

What the hell is wrong with you?, he hissed, and opened his hand.

I shrieked with surprise and disgust when I saw what he held. It was the body of a small bird, a sparrow, maybe, that was cut up and bleeding. Dislodged feathers stuck to the blood and greasy white discharge oozing from its truncated rear half.

Do you have any idea how sick your brother can get from this?, Dad asked. Behind his rage was a tone of deep concern and even fear. His fear only amplified my own.

I...I didnt, I stammered, and my eyes darted back and forth as I followed the hysterically-laughing fairies as they swept back and forth across the carnage in my fathers palm.

Stay here, Dad ordered. 

But, I tried to interject, but he grabbed my shoulder hard with his free hand and held me against the doorframe. The din of giggles stopped. I heard them whispering amongst themselves.

Dad leaned down and pushed his forehead against mine. When he spoke, his words were clear and smelled like the coffee hed been drinking.

You are not to say another word. You are not to leave this room. I am taking your brother to the doctor, and if your mother tells me youve said anything or set foot outside, I promise you will regret it.

He squeezed my shoulder harder and I winced and tried to fight back tears. He stared at me for a full ten seconds without saying anything, then he let me go.

Dad turned the corner to head downstairs and I saw what was coming but was too afraid to speak up. As he started down, I saw the fairies hurl themselves against the bottom of his foot before it had made contact with the first step. His foot landed awkwardly and his ankle twisted, sending him face first onto the uncarpeted wooden steps. The sound of his face impacting with the stairs seemed louder than anything Id ever heard.

Mom called from the bathroom where she was still attending to Todd. Dad didnt answer. I peeked around the corner. He was on his belly at the bottom of the stairs. He was moaning and weakly flailing his arms against the hardwood. His legs were still on the steps, but they didnt move at all.

Mom came out and down the hall, glaring at me before turning the corner and seeing her husband. She gasped and rushed to his aid. Not wanting to make them any angrier than they already were, I turned back into my room. I winced when I put pressure on my right ankle and limped back to bed, where I sat and stared at the fairies. 

They were laughing again. They flew like a shimmering, animated constellation around the room, weaving in and out of closets and drawers and galoshes. My ankle throbbed. The fairies formed a line in the air and held the formation for a moment, then they made a beeline for the dusty corner behind my dresser. They burst into peals of uproarious laughter and blinked out of view.

As the faint sound of sirens in the distance entered my ears, I gingerly walked to where the fairies had gone. I noticed a tiny feather. And then another. And another. When I reached the dresser and peered behind it, there was a clump of feathers and some blood right next to a small knife from our kitchen. I felt a pang of confused, disconnected recognition, but was shocked back to my senses by a fresh wave of pain from my foot and ankle. 

I sat on the floor with my back against the dresser. I pulled up the leg of my pajama pants and examined my ankle. It was swollen and red. The top of my foot hurt, too, and I drew my knee to my chest so I could get a closer look. Again, I felt confused and out of place. The sirens were loud and close but I wasnt paying attention to them anymore. 

I looked around for my fairy friends, but they were nowhere to be seen. For the first time, when I desperately needed to ask them a question, they were gone. My confusion grew teeth and fear pricked the skin of my back and neck. My ankle hurt, but that wasnt what was scaring me. It was my foot. Because even though I watched the fairies trip my dad, for some reason, the imprint of his work boot was etched in the skin of my foot - and my heel was stippled with tiny handprints.

<TITLE> A hard-learned lesson about body hair removal. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My trouble started when I realized I was out of razorblades and waxing supplies and my crotch looked like the Amazon rainforest before the mechanization of the logging industry. My date was due to arrive in half an hour. So, I resorted something unconventional. Something, I now realize, was not the best idea.

Im going to give a little backstory first. Im not ashamed to say I enjoy sex. The widespread belief that a woman should suppress her sex drive because society finds it improper has always disgusted me. Sex is great. Safe sex is wonderful. I respect myself and I respect the men I sleep with. All I ask is that I receive the same respect in return. Its just two people making each other happy.

Now, Ive known this since I was 15. Two decades of positive experiences have only strengthened my feelings on the subject. That said, there are a few personal responsibilities I feel I have, such as keeping current with the shaving trends. Im not a huge fan of the concept behind shaving myself, to be honest. If you think about it, its actually kind of creepy, but Ill still admit I enjoy the sensation of hairlessness. I guess its a tradeoff. 

I prefer to shave, but Ive waxed myself a lot, too. I have to be careful, though, because Im allergic to some of the waxes on the market. I dont know what particular chemical or fragrance it is that causes the irritation, but the itchy rash it produces keeps the downstairs out of business for over a week while it clears up. No one wants to pull off a thong and see that staring them in the face.

So, back to the other day. I found something in the apartment I thought would work like wax, so I tried it out. It hurt like hell and was an absolute bitch to wash off, but it did the job. My date arrived when he said he would. We hit it off at dinner and we ended up back at my apartment, where we both managed to achieve orgasm despite being so full from our meals that we were like two beached whales slapping against one another. Since we both had to get up early the next morning, we said our goodnights and he went home.

The itching woke me up before dawn. It started with my armpits, but then moved to my, if I may use the medical terms, box and asshole. I got out of bed and went into the bathroom. The mirror confirmed my assumption: that damn allergic reaction again. Welts were forming in extremely sensitive areas and it looked like I was already getting a bunch of ingrown hairs. I braced myself and doused the affected areas in rubbing alcohol, hoping none of the ingrowns would get infected. I showered and scrubbed, then went back to bed. I still itched.

When I got up to shower, the swelling looked pretty nasty and the ingrowns, despite my best efforts, were starting to get whiteheads. I got up and left for work. I sat in my cubicle feeling utterly miserable. The itching was way worse than any of the reactions Id had before. When I got up to use the bathroom, I checked the damage.

I almost threw up. A nearly perfect triangle of densely-clustered whiteheads occupied the entire area Id waxed. Even worse, and this is going to be gross but theres no real way to talk around it, theyd been popping the whole time I was sitting at my desk. My underwear was soaked. 

After cleaning myself up as best I could, I talked to my boss and told her I needed to leave early. She said it was no problem, so I left and headed straight to the walk-in clinic.

I lucked out and got seen right away. The doctor raised her eyebrows to the ceiling when she saw the reaction I was having, but quickly reassured me that she sees people who get skin irritation from hair removal all the time. She gave me some kind of ointment to rub on it twice a day and said if it doesnt improve in a week, shed give me something stronger.

I cancelled the date I had with the nice guy from the other night. I felt pretty bad, but he was understanding. He said was that he had to go on a business trip the next day and would be gone for a week. I told him that I looked forward to his return, assuming a week from then Id be in the clear.

Spoiler: I wasnt.

I applied the ointment diligently for a few days and most of the whiteheads stopped appearing. The swelling, though, persisted. Same with the itching. My armpits werent particularly bad, but my, well, perineum, and the surrounding area, was a disaster area. It was super swollen and it hurt to walk and use the bathroom.

The other night, six days after Id seen the doctor, the itching turned to flat-out pain. It wasnt unbearable, and if it had been, I wouldve gone to the emergency room right away, but it was enough to keep me tossing and turning in bed. The clinic started seeing patients at 6am and I was planning to be the first person there when the doors opened.

As the night dragged on, I felt steadily-intensifying pressure on the affected area. It got bad. I scratched through my pajamas and felt small pops under my fingernails. When I pulled my hand away, my fingers were wet. I gagged. Off to the shower I went.

Because I like you guys, Im not going to be as graphic as I could be. However, I can assure you this will be extraordinarily unpleasant to read. Before I jumped in the shower, I used my phone to take a quick picture of my perineal area. No, I wont share it with you. But my God, I wish I hadnt seen it. The small whiteheads in the area had clustered into a few very large ones. They bulged out of the skin almost half an inch and I knew right away that they were the cause of the pressure I was feeling.

I deleted the picture, got in the shower, and squeezed the biggest one as hard as I could. Its contents splattered on the floor of the bathtub like a pasty spitball. I watched as the water washed away the gooey parts. I bent down to look at what remained, screamed at the top of my lungs, threw on my clothes, and drove myself to the hospital.

Dont worry, Im going to be fine. I got to speak to a lot of specialists, though; lots of smart doctors whose curiosity was obvious. They kept me there for a few hours and cleaned up my crotch and armpits pretty thoroughly. Then I was discharged with a bunch of medications and tasked to share a bit of hard-learned advice. So here it is!

Always make sure the skin youre about to remove hair from is clean. Be mindful of the sharpness of your razor when shaving, and if waxing, do your best to avoid any chemicals you might be sensitive to. Stay away from depilatory products that havent been evaluated by the FDA. This includes, but is not limited to, creams, lasers, and waxes. 

Further, homemade depilatory products are discouraged. That was my mistake. Well, one of two. No one should ever, ever use flypaper for hair removal, especially flypaper thats not right out of the box. This is because no matter how clean it looks or how meticulously you picked the flies out of their sticky confines, they may leave pieces behind. In my case, those pieces were eggs.

<TEXT> The prospect of discovering a shipwreck containing riches beyond our comprehension was what drew us to scuba diving in the first place. Needless to say, we were disappointed pretty quickly. The likelihood of discovering a wrecked ship is infinitesimal, let alone a wrecked ship containing treasure. To make matters worse, even if we did discover such a thing, wed be forced to return everything wed recover to the ships country of origin. Maritime law or something.

My friends and I still liked to talk about it, though. Wed fantasize about it whenever wed go out on Toms fishing boat. 

Toms loaded. He made an obscene amount of money when he sold his Apple stock last year, having purchased tens of thousands of shares back when the stock was less than a buck and unloading it less than a percentage off its all-time high. This means his fishing boat is just ridiculous. Not only is his boat incredible, but the toys he has onboard are even more lavish. 

Of all of us, Toms the most obsessed with finding a Spanish galleon or equally gold-stuffed vessel. The sonar and underwater scanning systems he has onboard cost almost as much as the boat itself. Its amazing how clear and precise they are; we can see fish swimming under us with incredible resolution - sometimes were even able to make out their species. He came right out and told us he got the systems so he could find a shipwreck someday.

Whenever wed get bored fishing, wed dive off the boat every so often to keep in practice, but nowhere near the bottom. The deepest any of us had ever gone was a little over 100 feet. Where we fish off the coast of South Carolina, the water is over a mile deep - so a hundred or so feet isnt making much of a dent. Still, we have fun doing it, although we didnt really know how wed explore a shipwreck if we found one, considering it would be so far out of our diving range.

While were out on the boat, Toms cousin, Guy, when he isnt practically jerking off over the fantasies about what hed do with his share of the riches hes certain wed find someday, likes to regale us with stories about underwater cities and terrible Elder Gods wholl come to the surface someday and enslave humanity. I asked him if he was a Lovecraft fan, and all he said was, what do you think? 

Guys a writer. Not a particularly good one, either. Worse still, he never shuts up about the ideas he has. Wed been heading east in the boat for an hour, getting into progressively-deeper water, and Guy kept talking about a character hed dreamed of called Neptara who lived at the top of a mountain underwater. At the end of his story, hed reveal that Neptara is the cause of all shipwrecks, as hes able to move his mountain at will and place it in the path of any ship unfortunate enough to incur his wrath. 

On this most recent trip, since I was a few beers in and possessing less of a filter than I wouldve had otherwise, I asked if Neptaras only purpose was to cause underwater car accidents. Guy scowled at me, then replied, it was Neptara who built all the mountains, stressing the word all with obnoxious grandiosity. I was thankful my sunglasses hid the truly exceptional eye roll I performed.

After another hour of travel, we were coming up on the fishing spot Tom had picked out. Wed be there in 20 minutes. From his perch at the boats controls, we heard Tom yell holy fuck and he turned the boat so hard Guy and I fell out of our chairs.

I dusted myself off as Guy groaned and I headed up to where Tom was so I could pour a beer on him. As I was coming up the stairs, though, he grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me inside. He just said, look look look with wild enthusiasm in his voice and his eyes. He was pointing at one of the many screens on the dashboard or whatever its called on a boat. 

On screen, I saw a topographical readout of the area right below us. In the corner was a depth gauge which read 4322 feet. Tom moved the boat forward for a minute. The depth gauge started to change rapidly: 4010 feet. 2474 feet. 877 feet. 245 feet. 68 feet. When Tom cut the engines, the gauge read 61 feet. The topographical readout showed a small boat in the center, representing us, and a light blue circle which turned darker and redder. We were floating above a mountain under the Atlantic ocean. Neptara, I thought, and immediately felt annoyed that Guy was going to have an opportunity to expound on his awful story.

Guy was walking up the steps, clutching his shoulder and swearing at his cousin. I glanced at him. The shoulder was jutting forward at a weird angle. It was obviously dislocated. I felt frustrated; that probably meant wed have to go home without casting a single line. When Guy saw the screens, though, it looked like hed forgotten completely about his injury. 

You know what that looks like?!, he crowed. 

Yeah, yeah, I muttered. 

Tom hadnt said anything. He was fiddling with the sonar. When he finally spoke, his tone was one of amazement.

Check this out, he whispered. We huddled around the display.

At the top of the mountain, clear as day, was an image of a ship. 

No fucking way, Guy and I said in unison.

Well come back tomorrow, Tom announced. Well head back now and get Guys shoulder fixed. Ill mark the location. Christ, its shallow enough for us to dive.

Guy, to his credit, said, no way. You guys go check it out and Ill wait up here. Im not going to miss this shit. Tears were welling up in his eyes and I knew his shoulder mustve hurt like hell. I felt bad for him, but I knew after hed been talking about finding a sunken treasure for so long, theres no way he wouldve wanted to wait onshore.

Tom and I werent about to argue. It was only 10am; we had great scuba gear on board and hours to explore. We suited up and Tom pulled some communication equipment out of their compartments. He gave me something that looked like a bluetooth earpiece and said Guy could keep in contact with us the whole time we were under, just in case a storm or another boat was nearby and we needed to come up.

20 minutes later, Tom and I were on our way down. The water was warm, clear, and beautiful. After only a minute or so, we could see the wreck. It was absolutely massive; way bigger than wed thought. It was on its side; its three masts sticking straight out. There didnt appear to be any damage to the structure. It mustve been on the other side.

Fucking Guy, never one to miss an opportunity, made sure Tom and I learned everything there was to know about his Neptara story. We were a captive audience in the most literal sense of the term; we couldnt turn off his voice until we took off our gear and pulled out the earpiece. Thankfully, our excitement was able to overcome our annoyance.

We reached the ship and quickly saw it wouldnt be difficult to get inside. There was a large opening in the main deck that led down. In our ear, Guy was talking about Neptaras drive to build the surface of the world, starting underwater, and then moving to the surface when he was finished. Once he moved up there, humankind would be forced to change.

I followed Tom into the ship. Right away, we saw a skeleton; its surfaces picked clean by scavengers many, many years ago. Tattered clothing hung from the bones, and Tom reached his gloved hand inside a leather purse. He pulled out two coins. They were covered in slimy stuff. He rubbed one of them against the material of his scuba suit, and, gradually, the residue peeled away. In the beam of the flashlight, its surface shone. Gold. I heard him scream something triumphant behind his breathing apparatus.

A couple more bodies floated ahead of us. None of them carried coins. My flashlight passed over another opening which led down further into the ship. Neptara would move mountains in front of ships in order to affect the lives of the people on the surface, Guy continued. Since he couldnt enter the surface world until he was finished underwater, he aimed to disrupt shipping routes and cause stress on the economy.

I sighed around my mouthpiece, but I was grateful the story was getting a little more interesting. Tom signaled to me he was going down to the next deck, so I followed. 

There was more debris on that lower deck. Lots of general detritus and more slimy stuff on the surfaces. No bodies, though. There were individual rooms which almost looked like offices, and inside a couple of them were the leather covers of books or ledgers. The paper pages were long gone. 

In one of the rooms, there was a medium-sized iron safe. Tom made the triumphant sound again, but when he tried to move it, he realized it was far too heavy. The two of us were able to move it a little, but it would take at least four people to bring it to the surface. We knew wed be back down there again with some trusted friends in the near future, so we let it go. We wanted to keep looking around and find the main treasure hold.

Ancient cultures would worship Neptara, Guy informed us, as we looked around for another opening. They believed he was the God who shaped the rivers and ponds; all water, really. He was responsible for floods and droughts. They began to worship water itself, believing water was the most powerful force in nature because of how its presence allowed empires to be built.

There were no openings to go deeper into the ship. We had no idea how to go any further. Tom pointed up toward the surface and I nodded. Wed been exploring for a little over an hour and were running low on air. We navigated around the rooms and headed up through each floor until we were floating in front of the main deck. I was still blown away by how massive the ship was. We had to have only seen a quarter of the thing.

We started to swim up, but as I was kicking, I felt a hand grab my ankle. It was Tom, obviously, but hed still scared the shit out of me. He was pointing toward the stern of the ship. I showed him my air gauge and he nodded, but still gestured that I follow. I did.

Neptaras return will be on the summer solstice in the year 3341, Guy said. I was barely paying attention. I saw why Tom had turned us around. We swam until we approached a closed door in the deck right near the ships stern. That had to be it. A felt a pang of dismay when I saw a large, iron lock on the door. Tom disappeared for a moment and returned with a rock hed grabbed from the sea floor. With one blow, he smashed the lock through the rotten wood of the door. I pulled the door open.

By 3342, the humans Neptara allowed to live will have been reshaped into his image. Toms flashlight had stopped working, so he signalled for me to go ahead. I started swimming inside, picturing chests overflowing with gold and diamonds.

There was a ladder going down a narrow path to the bowels of the ship. It wouldve been a hell of a fall for anyone whod been climbing down if theyd lost their footing. I went slowly, being careful to avoid getting my equipment snagged on anything. The passage was far more narrow than anything wed traversed so far.

...purple skin, bulging eyes, and tentacles covering their bodies, came the voice in my ear. And when the great floods come to bring the surface world back to the ocean which had birthed it, people will be able to live and breathe in their new underwater homes.

I reached the bottom of the shaft and turned around with my eyes closed, preparing myself for the sight of the treasure wed talked about for years and years. My fantasies of loot were occasionally interrupted by unwanted visualizations of the monstrous creatures Guy wouldnt shut up about. I felt something hit my face and I jumped, causing Tom to grab my shoulder. Hed just gotten down to where I was, too. The room was murky and filled with particulate matter, making it very hard to see. I moved the flashlight beam all around and noticed what had hit my face was a small bone. I shuddered and moved forward, feeling Tom still holding my shoulder. 

Over time, we will develop gills and learn to communicate through resonance. The water carries sound so much better than the air - we will be more advanced. The remains of a skeletal body floated near a door, its clothes rotted away but its change purse still around its neck. I reached inside and pulled out a coin. I didnt look at it.

The door ahead of us was locked, but Tom had the presence of mind to bring his rock for when we encountered the treasure chests. He smashed the door lock just as easily as the first one and we gazed inside the enormous room behind it.

Guy babbled in our earpieces. I couldnt make out what he was saying. The signal was strong, but Id temporarily lost my ability to understand anything. Tom and I stood at the entrance and looked at what was illuminated by the wide flashlight beam. There werent any treasure chests. No bars of gold, either. Just skeletons. Rows and rows of skeletons. Skeletons covered in the merest scraps of fabric. Skeletons, I realized in one second of blinding, atrocious comprehension, that were still shackled to the floor and to one another with heavy, iron chains.

<TEXT> This went from 3k to 4k very quickly; I attribute a lot of it to how some of you started mentioning /r/subject3642 in the comments of posts that are relevant to the type of content I write - mushrooms, spiders, weird dicks, etc. 

If you guys want to share more frequently, please go ahead. It seems the only thing holding me back at the moment is the simple fact very few people know who I am and what I write. Those who find and read me, in general, like what I produce.  

So, if you find yourself in a Reddit thread or Facebook conversation or something and you think a mention of /r/subject3642 or UnsettlingStories.com might be warranted, feel free to drop a plug in there. And if you don't want to: hey, it's all good. I'll keep writing stuff that'll make you want to claw your skin off :D

Thanks for letting me do what I do here and for supporting me every step along the way. I never realized how much fun this could all be, and I'm really excited to see where this might go.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hed wait until everyone was asleep before starting. Id lie still and feign unconsciousness, but his voice would persist, weakly howling in terrible desperation, as he pleaded with me. Begged me. Implored me to help him take his life.

In the garish brightness of daylight, Id talk to my loved ones about our sleepless nights. The pity on their faces was obvious; so too was the resigned helplessness. They knew there was nothing they could do. All the suffering had to be endured by him, and, by association, me. I was his confidant; the only other person he felt comfortable speaking to. Sobbing to. Screaming to.

There was no mistaking the effects the stress had wrought on me. Id gained weight; Id gone on disability; Id grown depressed. Our doctors knew he had problems. They knew something - that was the word they used: something - was wrong with him. They just couldnt pinpoint what it was. That meant they couldnt do anything. 

Last night, we reached a breaking point. For hours, he screamed with impossible, earsplitting power. He regaled me with detailed descriptions about the pain he was enduring. Pain that my inaction was forcing upon him. The screams grew quiet as his energy evaporated. Just like every other night. But rather than sobbing pathetically and begging, his tone grew sinister. His words became violent.

Ill kill you, he whispered. Ill tear you in half.

My breath caught in my throat. Hed never said anything like that to me before. All the venomous contents of his words had always been directed toward himself. This was new. Terrifying.

Youre going to bleed to death, he informed me around a series of wracking sobs. Do you know how youll feel knowing you couldve ended this but didnt? Knowing you left the girls alone? 

The mention of the twins caused me to jump out of bed with rage and indignation. He knew what he was doing. Hed finally figured out what it would take for me to acquiesce. The thought of Dominique and Shonda in foster care because of his hatefulness and my cowardice was too much to bear. Too much for any mother to bear.

I started to cry while making the preparations Id dreaded since the first night he began begging me to take his life. I didnt say a word to him as I got ready. Every so often, hed call out and ask what I was doing. I didnt reply. He was too weak to scream. Too exhausted. All he spoke were pathetic words and phrases like, please and, it hurts so much. Words Id heard over and over and over, but with them now was a sinister element of or else. 

I knew if I did what he wanted, I could be thrown in jail. The twins would be without their mom, just like hed threatened. But this way, at least Id be alive. Also, if I was careful, I could get my close friends to help me hide his body. Theyd all but said they would in the past - in the darkest moments when I sought their comfort after months of restless nights.

By the time everything was set up, hed realized what was happening. Hed won. I felt sick. Part of me knew I was doing the right thing - that the suffering hed endured was too much for anyone to have to experience. But another part - a larger part - was doing it for another reason. I wanted him dead. I wanted him out of my life and out of my daughters lives and out of the periphery of my friends and extended family. I wanted my autonomy back.

We went into the bathroom where everything could be scrubbed clean. Some time later, our eight months of sleepless agony were over. The screaming had stopped. The pleading had stopped. The agony had stopped. Nothing remained but me and his corpse and the blood. Blood in the tub. Blood on my hands. Blood on my thighs. Blood on the coat hanger.

<TEXT> For decades, my sweetheart stared straight ahead. Before him, always, stood an expanse. Even if his eyes werent weak, he would have stared through the hopeless blankness of the cosmos across innumerable light years, past dying stars and decaying time, and have his gaze forever land on the back of his own head. Staring outward brought him nothing. Brought us nothing. Brought the world nothing. Billions of pairs of eyes staring at the back of the heads which imprisoned them.

Last night, The Universe slipped Her tongues inside my sweetheart, turned his eyes around, and allowed him to see the beauty hidden inside himself. His screams of pain and indignation turned to gasps of ecstatic transcendence. He became the first man in the history of men to see who he truly was. Who we truly are. Who we can truly be.

My sweetheart regaled me with stories about the man I thought I knew. Sounds passed through his lips and suffused my skull; syllables and sentences and syntax and semantics; introspection that would have been impossible before Her intervention. Her gift. The Universe continued Her manipulations as he spoke. My sweethearts eyes drooled their assent and he enthralled me with his enthusiastic tales.

His descriptors grew complex and the words became punctuated by, then gradually incorporated into, thick, harmonic buzzing. It was obvious hed reached a point in his discussion that was beyond my capacity to understand. The blood vessels traversing his inward-turned eyes throbbed and their optic nerves trembled. I imagined the sights he must be seeing, despite knowing, with a feeling of ever-increasing futility, that even my wildest, wide-eyed fantasy, if extrapolated to its fullest extent, would still terminate at the back of my head. 

As if sensing my dejection, my sweetheart caressed my belly. His touch was no longer familiar. In Her wisdom, The Universe had reshaped my sweethearts hand and arm. Long and segmented and annelidic with soft, rubbery protuberances, I gasped with alarm as its bulbous tip split and revealed a sharp, chitinous tip. The rubbery bits began to vibrate and I felt my bones humming in tune. I stared in horror as the keen end slid from the bulb and entered my abdomen. Expecting an onslaught of agony, I screamed. 

There was no pain. I should have known my sweetheart would never, ever hurt me.

I felt a system of roots spreading throughout the interior of my body. Rising higher, the system grew up my neck and into my head, feeling like ten thousand tongues tickling the inside of my face. A flicker of blurriness in my right eye confirmed my assumption and unspoken prayer: my sweetheart would share with me the gift The Universe had given him. 

An intense sensation of suction and a loss of depth perception caused me to swoon forward, but my sweethearts grip on my body ensured I remained upright. My ears itched almost unbearably and I heard crackling and stretching sounds as the little roots reconfigured and augmented my anatomy. Moments later, I understood my sweethearts words. I understood my sweethearts buzzing. My right eye, its pupil devouring the iris as it glared inside the mind which fed it, fixed itself on the sights inside while my visual cortex struggled to correlate the images of the outside word and the multiverse within me.

My sweetheart buzzed, and I found myself buzzing back. We effortlessly shared ideas and concepts and experiences in cascades of autoharmonic exchanges; his perspective of solipsistic mind-gazing melding with my half-world, half-mind dichotomy to create something new. Something blissful. 

The Universe, in Her endless beneficence and gentle guidance, has directed us to bring the world into our new relationship. This account of our transformation is designed to serve as an invitation. 

See us. Look upon the newness of flesh qua flesh, mind qua mind. Know you no longer need to be content with staring into space - into blankness - with no hope of seeing the richness of existence. We are here to bring hope. If these words seem insignificant, see us. If these words seem ineffectual, see us. 

We, for the first time, have seen us. Us as individuals - now us as one. The bleakness before our old eyes was an outward-facing abyss of loneliness and uncertainty. Now we see everything. We feel everything. And there is so much more to see. So much more to feel.

Please, see us. See us to feel us. See us to feel us to see one another and feel one another. Show us, and yourself, what you look like on the inside. And let the countless tongues of The Universe taste our union.

<TITLE> My Brother's Fall </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> While stationed in Iraq during operation Desert Storm, my brother, Gerald, was lost for two weeks. Officially, it was claimed he was captured by the Republican Guard and tortured before managing to escape. The condition of his body when he was found helped lend credence to the explanation. Lacerations, broken bones, and all sorts of other physical damage covered him from head to toe. 

He never recovered from the experience. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps after six months in a military hospital. When he was sent home, he began to display signs of Gulf War Syndrome. Years passed and his wife, Leah, cared for him as he weakened. His cognition, memory, and communication skills evaporated. Before he died last year, the brother I loved had been reduced to a gibbering husk. In his final moments, as Leah and I looked on, we were ready for his suffering end.

Then something happened, causing me to jump and Leah to gasp.

For the first time in eight years, Gerald expressed clear, articulate words: 

I fell in a hole.

He went on, his voice clear and strong, as Leah and I listened, spellbound.

Gerald had been patrolling the outskirts of a village when the ground beneath him gave way. He fell for a very long time. He landed at an angle, his right leg plunging into soft moss and dirt while his left struck a rock, shattering the femur. He couldnt believe he wasnt dead. The pain, he told us, while indescribable, took a backseat to what he saw.

Hed fallen into what he assumed was a cavern. As deep as he was, he expected to be in pitch darkness, but the cavern was anything but. Bioluminescent vines and lichen and fungi covered the walls and stalactite-studded ceiling far above. He heard water flowing somewhere nearby. 

Gerald did his best to extricate himself from the moss while trying to avoid losing consciousness from the pain of his broken leg. Some of the glowing vines which adorned the walls were very long and within his reach. He pulled himself up and out, then crawled on his belly down the small hill where hed landed, onto the main floor of the cavern. 

The floor was covered in feathers. Silvery-white and iridescent; they left streaks of dust on everything they touched, like the wings of moths. Gerald was surprised by their scent. It wasnt unpleasant. Not at all, in fact. It was warm and spicy; entirely uncharacteristic of what one would think of when hundreds, or even thousands, of feet underground.

The dust, despite its enjoyable odor, grew thick and choking as he crawled in the direction of the rushing water. He came across an ancient-looking branch, which he used to haul himself onto his healthy leg. Using the wood as a crutch, he continued to move.

The bioluminescence intensified as the cavern narrowed. The pinkish light was coming from all directions. Gerald realized its source was some kind of mold that blanketed nearly everything in the cavern. The closer he got to the water, the more mold there was. 

After walking for a few minutes, small patches of mold began falling from the ceiling like glowing snowflakes. The surreality of the cavern, the mold, and the feathers instilled a feeling of awe in Gerald, which clashed uncomfortably with the overwhelming pain in his leg and the fear that hed never find his way out.

Not long after, he reached the river. It was slow and shallow but quite wide, stretching easily a quarter-mile across. Mold flakes floated in thick clumps on its surface. No feathers, though. Whatever the rivers source was, the feathers were from elsewhere. 

He followed the river for a while. Despite the coolness of the water nearby, the cavern grew warmer. Narrower, too. The wide, tranquil river narrowed into frothing pink rapids. Gerald worried the bank would give way and hed be plunged into the rushing water. 

It did. 

He was.

For countless minutes, Gerald was carried by the current and tossed into rocks, further damaging his leg and carving lacerations all over his body. As he struggled, he glimpsed tunnels on either side of him, some too narrow for a man to crawl through, some wide enough to fit a parade of elephants. Many of the wider ones were choked with feathers, which joined him and the glowing mold clots in the turbid water.

A roar filled the air, echoing off the stone walls and ceiling and drowning out the sound of the river. Before he knew what was happening, Gerald was airborne. As he tumbled through the air, he saw the waterfall hed fallen from. He slammed into the water below and lost consciousness.

Gerald regained his senses some time later on the bank of a wide lake. He was on his back with his broken leg twisted underneath him. Screaming in agony, he didnt notice the movement nearby. Not until it was on top of him.

Something wrapped around his ankle and hauled him into the air. The lake below him shrank as he was pulled ever higher, over a ledge, and stuffed upside down into a crevice in the ceiling. 

At this point, as he told the story, Gerald began to cry. Leah held his head against her chest and did her best to console him, but his sobs were unrelenting. Gasping for breath and leaking tears, he continued to choke out words.

The view below him was no longer one of water and feathers and bioluminescent mold. The view was now one of horror and depravity.

Piles of mutilated bodies lay in writhing heaps on the floor. Some were dead, but most appeared alive. Their open mouths produced no screams, but agony was obvious in their expressions. Their wounds gaped and wept. The majority of the damage was to their backs, but many chests and bellies had been flayed and left to leak their contents onto the flailing victims trapped underneath them.

Gerald did his best to take it all in and think rationally. Craning his head and neck to look over his shoulder, he saw something massive in the distance. Something alive and moving in strange, circular patterns around a stationary central point. There was less light in this part of the cavern than where hed initially fallen. There was no bioluminescent mold covering the walls and ceiling. Even if there was, it would have been coated with blood and gore. No, the only light around him was from fire.

Innumerable torches stood inside holes bored into the stone floors and walls and ceilings. Flames gouted and flowed within their osseous confines, illuminating the killing floor of violence and torment which stretched all the way to the leviathan far behind him.

The rock in which Geralds leg was stuffed cracked. Gerald began to fall, headfirst, toward the pile of bodies a hundred feet below. He knew this was one fall he wouldnt be able to survive. As he imagined his spine splintering as his head struck the head or face of someone below, his ankle was grabbed again. The force of the grab, combined with the velocity of his fall, snapped his pelvis. The pain was immediate and unendurable. Gerald saw dark stars blooming in his vision. His consciousness waned. 

He traveled in a gray fog toward the colossus hed glimpsed while trapped. Part of him was aware of the thing which held his ankle. It was thin and tentacular; a living vine or organic cord or serpentine whip. Something he couldnt understand. He was dropped at the floor in front of the huge creature.

Whatever it was, it didnt have his attention. The fog of his semi-consciousness was burnt away by the sight of incredibly-bright white light. It was light unlike anything hed ever seen; the radiance should have been blinding, but it caused no pain at all. It didnt etch auras into his retinas like when hed glimpsed at the sun, despite being thousands of times brighter. It didnt travel, either - it was confined to one particular area. It produced no blazing heat or discomfort whatsoever. Only calming warmth. He felt overwhelming serenity as he locked his eyes on the man-sized light source.

The serene calm was punctured as tens of the organic tendrils erupted from somewhere above and raped their way into the brilliance. Gerald experienced a sense of hideous, disembodied violation, as if he were watching the assault of a loved one while feeling every moment of their pain and indignity with his own body. He cringed and retched, tears filling his eyes, as he watched the tendrils pull a man from somewhere inside the light source.

The spicy, warm smell from earlier in the day filled Geralds nostrils. The man from the light struggled against the grasp of the tendrils, his nude, muscular body completely helpless against their strength. As the man was pulled into the room with Gerald and the tendrils, Gerald gasped.

The mans back was home to a pair of enormous wings. They flapped and sent violent currents of wind across the floor, blowing dust in all directions. While the man struggled, more tendrils came down from the ceiling. With practiced meticulousness, they uprooted the appendages from the mans back. The sound of heavy shrubbery being torn from the ground filled the air. The mans face contorted into a shriek of abject, torturous agony, but he made no sound. The only noise was the nauseating tearing as the man was disfigured.

Feathers broke from the wings and floated to the ground. With one final tug, the wings were separated from his body. Their stumps leaked dark blood which puddled on the dirt floor, contrasting obscenely against the magnificence of the white light just feet away.

The man stopped struggling against the tendrils. He slumped, his muscles relaxed, and stared at the ground in front of him. A series of much thinner tendrils descended and plucked all the feathers from the wings and shuttled them away, leaving the bleeding amputations in the dirt. Another tendril whipped downward at a blinding speed, striking the mans abdomen and splitting the flesh. His intestines bulged from the wound and the tendrils holding him pulled him through the air toward the countless other bodies Id been perched above moments before.

Leah and I watched Gerald with horrified amazement as he recalled these events. We had no idea if he was telling the truth or if it was all just a manifestation of the illness which was about to take him from us. 

The three of us wept while Gerald looked around, as if trying to determine whether or not we believed him. I felt like I needed to say something, so I asked, what happened next? How did you get out? Leah nodded, encouraging him to go on.

Geralds voice dropped to a whisper.

Disoriented and in immense pain, Gerald tried to look around. The room was too big. He couldnt get a good idea of what he was seeing or where he was, but he knew he was right in front of the creature hed seen. He tried to struggle to his feet, but the injury to his hip and leg was too great. The fractured bones ground against one another and he screamed so hard he felt his lungs might burst. 

He was grabbed again. This time, by his shoulders. Two tendrils hauled him up and up and up. He saw the thing in front of him. The colossus. The leviathan. The serpent. The head of an impossibly large snake bulged at the apex of a body of thick trunks. Each trunk had bifurcated into a series of thinner trunks. Each thinner trunk had bifurcated into a series of tendrils. Each series of tendrils had bifurcated into more, thinner tendrils. And so on.

The thick, spicy odor filled the area again. He knew it meant more wings were being destroyed. The snake stared at him, its yellow eye full of hideous intelligence and unknowable age. They gazed at one another, and Gerald heard words in his head. Words that were not spoken to him, but thought at him:

Tell everyone what you saw. Tell everyone what I am. Let them know Ill be coming soon.

The next thing Gerald knew, he was on his back, staring at the unforgiving sun of the Iraqi desert. He was found by locals hours later.

Geralds whispering tapered off and he closed his eyes. I was terrified hed passed away. Leah shook him and said his name a few times, panic rising in her voice. Geralds eyes opened. His lips parted.

The serpent, Gerald whispered. He coughed and stared at the ceiling, a tear trickling from the corner of his eye.

...was wrapped around a tree. The tree was filled with apples. Millions upon millions of them.

Leah clutched his hand and I held his shoulder.

I watched as tiny snakes crawled into the ripest ones. Pieces of him. Then the apples disappeared. They went into a hole in the air. And I could see what was on the other side of the holes. Orchards. Trees all over the world. His apples are filling them.

His eyes fluttered closed and he breathed the last words wed ever hear him speak.

Weve been eating them for millennia. Hes inside us all.

<TEXT> We couldnt have asked for a more beautiful day at the beach. I smiled while I kept an eye on the kids. It was obvious that Ryans arm was getting tired. His two sisters, Madison and Regina, were looking around for things that might be able to help him out.

While I watched, Madison trawled for seaweed. She noticed Ryan was uncomfortable and tried to rush. Luckily for her brother, the pressure pushing against his arm had diminished and he was able to straighten up. Hurry up!, he yelled to Madison and Regina. Hes by far the most impatient one in the family. 

Dont yell at your sisters, I scolded. Still, I gently encouraged them to move faster. Part of me was wondering if my wife had used enough sunscreen on them.

Time is a factor, kids, I informed them. We were on a pretty tight schedule.

Madison brought the seaweed over to Ryan while Regina was arriving with a few heavy rocks. Regina set them down in front of where her brother was standing. She went back a few times and carried over more. Madison crouched, her butt in the water, and focused on slipping the seaweed underneath and around the rocks.

I stood, hands on my hips, and called out, How does it look, kids?

I think were done!, shouted Madison. She seemed proud of all the work theyd been doing. Shes never been particularly modest.

I looked back up the beach and all around. Then I strode out to where my kids had been working.

You all did SUCH a great job! I grabbed the three kids in a bear hug and they stood, watching as the tide came in over the area where theyd done their good work.

We walked together about a hundred feet down the beach and stood on the shore. It was time for me to give them their little quiz.

Now remember kids, Mom will be back in a few minutes. What do we do when we see her coming?

Regina piped up. We pretend cry and look around in the water!

Thats right! How about you, Ryan, what are you going to say?

Ryan stood proudly with his hands on his hips. I say that Jason fell out of my hug into the ocean when a wave came and we cant find him.

Atta boy!, I crowed. I turned to Madison. Maddie, are you excited to have your bedroom all to yourself again? No more crib and no more crying?

Madison smiled shyly at her tall, strong father. Yes Daddy, she said.

Good!, I exclaimed, grinning. And now your mom and I can have more money to buy you guys presents for being such great kids. I glanced over to my left. And I think that person walking waaaaay down the beach is Mom. You all ready?

Yeah!, the kids yelled in unison.

Go for it!, I encouraged, blinking away the tears of pride that had started to well up in my eyes.

<TEXT> Im surrounded by corpses. People I knew. People I cared about. For hours, I sat in the stillness of this supermarket-cum-abattoir and waited. The growls and groans outside waxed and waned as each wave passed by. Waves of former friends. Waves of strangers who I never had the opportunity to befriend. Limitless potential gnawed away by the ravages of plague. 

After some time, the movement started. Bodies. Body parts. It didnt matter. That which was once animated got reanimated. A severed head blinked and opened its mouth. A puddle of viscera convulsed in peristaltic spasms. A pile of fingertips and toes wiggled. And corpses, more-or-less whole, stood.

Dylan began to squirm in my lap, still leaking. His bleating, which had been cut off by his father 80 minutes ago, resumed. It was lower. More guttural. The optic nerve protruding from his left eye socket slapped wetly against his soft cheek. My boy was awake, and my last act as his mother would be to feed him. Its what I was here for, no matter the shape he was in. I put my thumb in his mouth and waited for his few, sharp little teeth to sink in.

His cool tongue prodded at the digit. But his jaw didnt close. He didnt bite. I spoke to him, encouraging him to go ahead. He shook his head and tried to spit out my thumb. I persisted. Dylan vomited a pink froth of blood and breast milk onto my hand. Still, nothing.

Three of the reanimated bodies had started lurching toward us. I knew if Dylan wasnt going to be the one to change me, they would. But theyd tear me to shreds. Just like the others had done to his father while I was locked in the bathroom. I started to panic. I didnt want to be torn apart and have Dylan left alone to squirm pathetically on the supermarket floor forever.

The three were practically on top of us. Id failed. Their teeth were coming. An image of Dylan struggling in the dried tangle of my twitching entrails six months from now brought an involuntary sob. I begged him to bite me. He just growled and choked.

The first one moved in to bite. Then he stopped. He stared at me, teeth snapping together over and over, drooling shards of enamel and blood and saliva onto my shoulder. The other two did the same. Then they turned around and walked away. Nothing. They didnt want me.

A surge of relief combined with confusion and sadness. My boy didnt want me, either. No one did.

Time went by and waves of fresh dead entered the supermarket. They inspected me, and, like the others, rejected me. I gave up on trying to make Dylan bite. Hed never eaten anything that solid before in his life. I knew it was useless. He seemed content to thrash and flail and leak and cool. 

During the quiet moments between waves, I heard soft crying. I knew who it was. As I was running out of the bathroom after the initial attack to check on Dylan and my husband, I saw a young store employee shutting herself in a small closet near the floral department.

Dylan drooled and moved his jaw as the sounds of the teenager met his ears. It had been hours since hed eaten. It was then I realized what I had to do. Its what any mom would do for her son.

A couple minutes later, I had control of her. She was easy enough to knock unconscious. Easy enough to tie up. But I knew if she changed, Dylan wouldnt want to eat any more. 

She yelled very loudly as I cut off a piece of her calf. I placed it in Dylans mouth. He tried to chew, but it was just too cumbersome. He wasnt used to something that solid. I sighed and gazed into my sons eye. I took the chunk from his mouth and cut off a fresh piece.

After Id chewed and spit it into his mouth, I could swear he smiled at me. And that was when I knew our mom/son connection wasnt broken. Even though the rest of the world didnt want me, Dylan still did. Thats the only thing that matters.

<TEXT> Carol heard it first and woke me up. She told me to listen. Then I heard it. Bumping and scraping. Shuffling and clattering. I turned on the light. The sounds stopped.

It was still our first month in the new house. By new, I mean new to us. It was quite old; over 100 years. Like any old house, it had its share of creaking and groaning, but wed grown used to all that after the first couple weeks. These sounds were new. Unfamiliar. Unsettling.

We listened in silence for a few minutes. Nothing. Carol flipped on the TV and we watched Chopped! for a little while before getting tired enough to go back to sleep. And we did.

The next morning, a Saturday, which was supposed to be a day for yard work, was spent sealing all the visible cracks and holes around the baseboards and windows. Carols concern, which I echoed, was a vermin infestation. Rats were a problem for some of the houses in the area. Our neighbor, a strange, elderly fellow named Herman, had mentioned an opossum infestation in his barn in the 1990s. Just the cost of rural living, he proclaimed, before regaling us with the details of how he dispatched them all in the course of an afternoon with a pitchfork. 

I made a trip to the hardware store and picked up a few rat traps. Nothing major; just enough to put in the basement and in a few other areas we thought they might traverse. Over the next week, when we heard those strange sounds again, we just assumed we were dealing with rats. We were a little grossed out, but the concern was mostly gone. Their days were numbered. It was only when the traps remained untouched that we started to feel a little uneasy.

During a particularly bad, sleepless night, when the bumping and shuffling sounds went on for hours and Id gotten out of bed and walked all around the house trying to find the source, I was frustrated and exhausted. Id traced the loudest of the noises to a closet in the hallway. Hoping to scare the rats into shutting up, I pounded on the closets interior wall. When my fist struck the old board, the board next to it fell out. Scared the hell out of me. 

Expecting rats to start scurrying toward me, I grabbed the board and got ready to beat as many to death as I could. No rats came. But the sounds had stopped. There was only the soft din of whatever TV show Carol was watching in the bedroom. I was getting ready to replace the board when I saw something on the ground behind where the piece had fallen out. I picked it up. A scrap of newspaper with the headline: *Another Infant Missing: 17th in 10 months.* It was dated March 3rd, 1933.

I shuddered and shoved the scrap in my pajama pocket. Of all the things the rats could use to make their nests, it had to be something so morbid. As I started to replace the board, the sound resumed. This time, it was far louder than ever. The bumps shook the house and a clattering like a thousand rattlesnakes filled the air. The power cut out. Upstairs, Carol hollered. I ignored her. Something else had grabbed my attention.

After the first, violent bump, before the lights went out, I saw the two adjacent boards in the closet had fallen away. They revealed a much larger space behind the closet than Id thought. 

I felt my way to the kitchen and grabbed a flashlight out of the drawer. I flipped it on and jumped a mile when I saw Carol standing across the room. She looked frightened and annoyed. I grabbed her hand and we marched to the hall closet. The rattling persisted. 

We peered into the hidden compartment and followed the beam of the flashlight. Something on the floor glinted back. I started to squeeze between the boards to get closer. Carol grabbed my arm and told me not to go in. I shook her off. I made my way inside and saw something bizarre: a metallic, glittery wand and a very large tiara - way too big for a child. A piece of cloth was underneath. I picked it up and shook away the dust. The letters TF were emblazoned across it in garish, cartoonish cursive.

The rattling grew deafening. I turned around and saw Carol holding her ears and crying. I aimed the flashlight around the rest of the space. A large bucket sat in the corner. The two steps it took to reach it only served to increase the amplitude of the noise. As soon as I pointed the flashlight beam inside it, the sound stopped. The bucket trembled in the yellowish light.

Inside were more newspaper clippings with equally disturbing headlines. More missing infants. The more I pulled out and read, the numbers kept rising. The last one said 88. December 12th, 1941. There was a thick piece of cardstock under them. I lifted it and uncovered more pieces of paper. They were different. Handwritten. Just numbers and dates and what looked like prices:

*4/4/39 - 3 - $30*  
*6/23/45 - 10 - $95*  
*10/1/46 - 2 - $25*


And so on. There were lots of these. Receipts, I assumed. Carol had entered the room and stood next to me, clutching my arm. Under the receipts was another piece of cardstock. I lifted it away and uncovered a few handfuls of little pebbles or seashells. Sticking out of them was a small, colorful placard with the same cursive as the cloth. We read it together. Carol screamed and I felt faint. Right then, I knew what the TF meant on the cloth. Cloth that had been, I realized, a cape.

I dropped the placard back in the bucket. The contents rattled. In bright, pink, handpainted letters, the words stared back up at us.

*For sale: baby teeth. Never used.*

<TEXT> [*Related*.](http://unsettlingstories.com/tc)

All my life, Ive been obsessed with symmetry. Ive sought it in all aspects of my life: physical, emotional, and spiritual. Its what called me to astronomy and cosmology; I felt an intense need to learn if the system of which we are all part is symmetrical. Ordered. Beautiful.

My career has been fascinating and fruitful. The discoveries made by fellow scientists all over the world have allowed us to create model after model of the universe with ever-increasing detail. Weve learned what things are and how theyve come to be. Weve seen heavenly events occur and have determined their causal chains. Action, just like wed come to expect, will have an equal, but opposite, reaction. 

Except when it doesnt. To account for those exceptions, weve employed elaborate, explanatory formulae to make things work - to make things ordered. For most people, its good enough. It gets things to fit into their epistemic worldviews. My epistemology isnt amenable to that kind of hand-waving. I recognize scientific discoveries are made on the backs of those which came before. I know exceptions need to be made; rules are created or modified all the time in the face of new evidence. But not in the face of what sits within Eridanus. Eridanus is where epistemology goes to die.

In 2001, our team received the first trickle of information from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. Over the following days, the trickle became a torrent. We worked tirelessly and with boundless enthusiasm as previously-secret aspects of our universe were unveiled. Months of steady research passed. An unsettling trend began to grow from the data.

An area inside Eridanus was cold. Beyond cold. Certain spots were a full 140 K colder than the Cosmic Microwave Background. This discovery, and subsequent verification by the Planck spacecraft in 2009, upended previously-held theories about large-scale structures in the universe. Much was reported about the size and temperature of the CMB Cold Spot; speculation ran rampant and talking points about parallel universes and remnants of a phase change from the early universe circulated throughout all the science tabloids.

But the speculators didnt have all the information. A key detail was withheld from the public. For the last 15 years, that detail remained hidden behind firewalls and locked inside the minds of brilliant, terrified astronomers and cosmologists. The colossal void within Eridanus - the CMB Cold Spot - has something at its center. Something impossible. Something that has been leaking a relativistic stream of unknown radiation in a narrow band directly at Earth. Now, a decade and a half after its discovery, weve learned the radiation is structured. Patterned. Predictable. 

Aat Narkhirunkanok, the first of us to recognize a pattern, wrote a short note detailing what hed discovered. It was found next to his body, on the passenger seat of his car, which had been running in his closed garage while the rest of his family slept. He also left a USB drive.

The remaining team and I, propelled more by fear than curiosity, each read the note. It was a description of a type of filter to be applied to the data gathered by the WMAP and the Planck spacecraft. The USB drive contained the filter Aat had coded before taking his own life. 

In his note, Aat wrote that hed run the filter on a tiny sample of data on his home computer. It was all he needed to see. But we needed to see more. We filtered the entire dataset on our cluster. At the end of the filtering process, Aat had created an algorithm to convert the filtered data into a video. After hours of CPU time, the familiar traffic-cone icon of a VLC file sat on the desktop.

I asked my two team members if they wanted to see what the file contained. They were both acutely aware of the terrible and unpredictable action the data had caused Aat to take, but inquisitiveness overtook their caution. We gathered around the main screen and watched. I double clicked the VLC file.

A video opened showing a three-dimensional ovoid containing countless galaxies. It was a model of the universe, only vastly more sophisticated than anything wed ever used. The model zoomed inward, and as galaxies sharpened into individual stars, the Eridanus constellation came into view. False color filled the screen, indicating radiation. The Cold Spot was clearly visible. 

The view focused on the void and zoomed toward its dark center. The first thing we noticed was a thin, straight line of bright radiation emanating from an unknown point in the middle. It had to be the band the pattern had arrived on. The view continued inward, and a gray spot appeared in the blackness. A sensation of dread began to prickle the hair on my neck and arms. 

The gray spot grew to fill the screen. It was moving. It lurched and convulsed in place, rippling and pinching - sometimes pinching so severely in its center that it looked as if it would split, only to twist back on itself. I felt intense nausea as I watched. Parts of the things exterior went transparent, providing a view of the shifting geometry contained within. 

Rings formed all over the shape and its interior pushed through, then reversed and collapsed into another point we could see through the invisible exterior wall. I closed my eyes as cold sweat poured from my face and my mouth dried up. I heard Gita crying next to me and John, who was behind me, gasped. I opened my eyes and saw the view zooming out dramatically. 

As individual stars gave way to galaxies and galaxies gave way to galactic clusters, we saw a very different model of the universe than wed originally been given. It was dimmer. Vastly colder. Holes of pure void had consumed entire swaths of galaxies. At my side, Gita screamed. I didnt move my eyes from the screen. I watched as the remaining galactic light in the model began to shift and undulate. It pinched at the center like an hourglass. Gita screamed again and grabbed my arm. 

I shrugged her off and watched the left half of the hourglass instantaneously suck into the right half. Twice the galactic density, half the size. This new model pinched again, and the process repeated. And again. And again. Gita pulled me by the hair but I pushed her away. All that remained was a single point of light containing everything. All the stars. All the mass. The view zoomed in while Gita sobbed, and I saw, next to the pinprick of light, the gray thing. Its exterior grew transparent again and repulsive, impossible geometries writhed within its shifting, asymmetrical bulk. The pinprick moved toward it. I blinked, and it was gone. The gray thing was still. The video ended.

I turned toward my crying colleague and realized what shed been trying to get me to see. John sat limply in his chair with a pen pushed through his left carotid artery and a pencil through his right. His bloody hands were folded in his lap. His expression was one of abject terror.

The phone rang. I answered, barely comprehending what the person on the other line said. I asked them to repeat themselves, and they did. It was an observatory in Europe that had been studying the structure of the CMB Cold Spot. They were going to send us new findings on old data they wanted us to analyze. According to the voice on the other line, their most recent analysis Cold Spot had yielded entirely new results. They had no idea how such a change could have occurred, but every point of data was in agreement: The CMB Cold Spot had doubled in size.

<TEXT> The visual effect of geometry in art can be intoxicating. Symmetry is beauty, and vice versa. I remember looking at myself in the mirror and seeing asymmetry. Chaos. A shape, certainly, but not one of mathematical precision or artistic effort. Rather, one of slothful neglect. The product of a blind, talentless sculptor using mud instead of marble. I decided to change. I could be beautiful, too.

Everywhere I went, I looked for inspiration. After a brief period of searching, Nature Herself provided me with all I needed. I knew what I could become.

I began to lose the extra weight Id been carrying around. It wasnt as difficult as Id expected. The speed at which the pounds came off became an added bonus; I was left with skin that sagged over my beltline and under my chin and under my arms. A happy accident.

With 60 pounds lost and a newfound energy I attributed to better physical health, I began to work on my art. Over the last few months, Id accumulated thousands of the different tools Id need for the process. I employed the smallest ones first. One by one, I inserted the thinnest of the pins into the pores under my chin. The pain was surprisingly mild; Id expected my nerves to put up more of a fight. Knowing my body was so accepting of this change made me smile. I was a blank canvas with unlimited potential.

I slept soundly with the hundreds of metal pieces occupying the saggy flesh. Each one was stretching the pore. Each one was making room for the next tool. 

The following day, I swapped the first set of pins for the next, slightly-wider set. Again, there was little pain. I twisted each of the pieces around in lazy circles, allowing the motion to widen the spaces in which theyd been set. When I removed one of them to see if I was making any progress, the little hole stayed open. It was working.

Days went by as I repeated the process with wider and wider pins or needles. I was grateful for the loose skin. There was so much more room to work. After three weeks, the holes were the diameter of a pencil eraser. After two months, they were as wide as my pinky finger is thick. Id reached the maximum size of my tools. It didnt matter; I was done. I pulled the skin down to expose the holes. There were hundreds of dark, bloodless pits occupying the pores.

Id never walked around the house with the holes exposed until that moment. The sensation of air against the nerves inside was indescribable. It was as if Id grown a whole new body part that was feeling for the first time. How much more of me was trapped beneath the surface, deep in slumber, waiting to be awakened? I would have to wait to find out. There was so much left to do.

Mother Nature, in Her wisdom and beauty, had presented me with a wasps nest on the day I sought inspiration. I remember studying its pockmarked surface, each hole a beautiful, hexagonal prism. When I returned to the nest, itd grown larger. Id planned for this, though. I used smoke to nullify the majority of the adults as I took their home with me. Once there, I carefully cut the nest in half. The few angry wasps that remained were destroyed. I was after their children. 

With great care, I smeared small bits of honey inside each of my new holes. Everything Id read told me how much they loved it. Once the interiors were coated, I used a tweezers to tease the larval wasps from the papery cavities. They fit inside me so perfectly. Hours later, I was finished. I felt full. Every so often, one of them would wiggle inside. Pressed against the sensitive flesh within the pore, it was like the larvae were tickling me. I sat back and watched myself in the mirror, giggling as I admired the work of functional art I was becoming.

Id have to wait nearly two weeks for the larvae to start spinning silk for their metamorphoses. I dutifully fed them honey as they grew fatter and more active, feeling them stretching the pores beyond the diameter to which Id grown accustomed. The pain, while greater than Id experienced before then, was still hardly a concern. It was all worth it.

While I waited, I studied my body to find the site for my next project. My belly was the most obvious, as it was the largest area and had the most loose skin, so it was what I chose. I didnt want to use wasps again, though. If I was going to be a true piece of art, I wasnt going to only use one subject. I found a picture of a beautiful frog that kept its eggs inside holes in its back. When they hatched, left behind a lovely, cratered surface. I was overcome by the beauty of it all and decided the frog would be my next featured piece.

I rushed to create the holes in my belly. In a burst of creative inspiration, I included my chest and the skin under my arms. Because of my excitement, I started with much thicker needles than Id used on my chin. The pain was intense and blood poured from the sites, but the holes appeared quickly. After weeks spent dealing with complications and having to stretch cavities whose diameter decreased as the swelling and infection surrounding it increased, I felt the little cocoons in my neck start to hum. The larvae had spun their silk and sealed off their little homes many days ago. They were changing. So was I.

More days flew by as I grappled with the reality of how I wouldnt be able to find the frogs in time before the new holes swelled to the point of being nearly shut. I was depressed for a day or so, but its curtain was lifted whenever the babies inside my throat hummed to me. During a particularly dark period of sadness, I noticed flies were landing in the areas of my body thatd been overcome by putrefaction. Id given up my hope of featuring another piece of beautiful art and was taking consolation in the fact my throat and neck looked so lovely. So fertile.

As the flies gathered, though, I realized what they were doing. I pushed my fingers into the holes and pried them open. Deep within, writhing in the sludge at the bottom of each cavity, were tiny maggots. As tears ran down my eyes, I rushed to the mirror. The openings, while ugly, were still in a clean, symmetrical pattern. Was it all exactly what Id intended? No. But was it better? There was no doubt. Not all art has to be perfect.

While I stared at my reflection, wondering what I could do next, I felt one of the cocoons hatching in my neck. Then another. And another. Joy overwhelmed me. I was giving birth. It was then I realized I wasnt only an artist, but a parent. A true contributor of beauty to the world. My art hadnt only imitated life - my art had created it.

<TEXT> I pulled the charger out of my iPhone and a string of viscous fluid stretched between the charging tip and the opening in the phone. To say I was irritated was an understatement. Id just bought the thing.

There was a small pool of clear liquid on the table where itd been charging. I touched my finger to it and sniffed. There wasnt much of a scent. I tasted it. Salty. The worst possible scenario. Saltwater destroys electronics. I had no idea what I couldve spilled.

The screen was off and the power button wasnt responding. I brought the phone into the bathroom and aimed the hairdryer into the charging port, being careful not burn anything. When it was as dry as it was going to get, I tried to power it up again. It worked. 

I thought about bringing the phone back to Apple, but I knew they wouldnt do anything. Theyve gotten good at knowing when a device has been damaged by water. I wasnt in the mood to get into a fight at the Genius Bar.

The day went on and my phone seemed no worse for wear. I made calls and played games and browsed Reddit without any issue. Before going to bed, I plugged it in to charge.

The following morning, when the phones alarm went off and I leaned over to hit snooze, my hand slid into a puddle of warm fluid. Cursing, I grabbed the phone and was about to pull out the charger when I stopped. Instead of my lock screen or the iOS icons, something that looked like a screensaver was running. Colors were flowing in weird, peristaltic undulations from the top of the screen, intensifying and darkening as they got closer to the bottom. It was actually quite pretty.

I heard a sound coming from the speaker. Being careful not to get any of the fluid on my face, I put it to my ear. Bizarre waves of warm static were being played in rhythm with the motion of the colors on the display. The waves of static were picking up speed. So were the colors. As I watched with a combination of fascination and annoyance, the static became staccato and the colors blinked faster and faster before culminating in a bright flash and a burst of static. 

The phone had to have a virus or some kind of malware. Still, that didnt explain the liquid. Id made sure the table was dry before plugging the phone in the night before. I pulled the cable out. A gush of clear, sticky stuff drooled from the port onto my chest. Its smell was stronger than the day before. I gagged and got out of bed.

I used the hairdryer on my phone again. It was back to working normally. Opting to go with the virus/malware theory and not wanting to think about the liquid other than how badly I wanted to get it off me, I used a different cable to connect the phone into my laptop so I could do a complete software restoration. I went into iTunes, clicked the necessary things, and went to shower. The fluid had dried into a disgusting, gummy syrup thatd caused my chest hair to stick together.

I was in the shower for 45 minutes trying to pull all the rubber-cement-like stuff off me. As soon as I turned off the water, I heard something from outside the bathroom. I wrapped a towel around my waist and headed toward the sound. It was similar to the static Id heard before, but now it was coming from two sources: the phone and the laptop. As I got closer, I saw colors on both screens.

The colors and sounds were synched up again, but the two devices were playing off each other. The sounds on the laptop affected the colors on the phone, and vice versa. I sat on the couch in front of the devices and watched. Then stared. Then gazed. Right at that moment, there was nothing else on Earth I wanted to see more. 

I saw it all. I felt something, too. But the feeling was tangential. Indirect. As the moment of bliss passed, emptiness and a need for more bloomed within me. From the bloom came a realization.

I tore myself from the screens and rummaged through the drawers that held all my spare electronics. Cables, USB hubs, network switches, etc. I took them all.

Returning to my position in front of the screens and fixing my eyes on the waxing and waning undulations, I noticed that same fluid beginning to dribble from the USB port in the laptop as well as the charging port in the phone. Colors swam in my vision as I inspected the other USB ports on the other side of the computer as hope flooded my chest. Then I saw it. My hope was not misplaced.

The ports on the other side of the laptop were dripping. They were ready. I took one of the USB cords I had in my hand and carefully teased it inside the waiting port. On right side of the laptop screen, which I knew corresponded with the port Id just entered, a hazy, pink semicircle began to brighten the edge of the display. 

With my eyes fixed on the warm pink and my ears serenaded by each peak and trough of gentle static, I brought the other end of the USB cable to my lips.

As the metal touched my flesh, a tiny shock passed through me. It was not unpleasant. Quite the contrary; it was enticing. Attention-getting. And indeed, it had my full attention. I traced the plug around the bow of my lips, savoring the gentle, constant prickling. My mouth watered as the pink spot grew and pulsed onscreen. 

My tongue flicked the tip of the plug. Its touch was met by a drop of liquid. I closed my eyes and focused only the sounds and the feeling on my lips and tongue. The metal was so warm - almost hot. Almost burning. More liquid seeped out of the plug. It was slick and salty. My heart was pounding in my ribcage while I drew wet lines across my lips before taking the plug into my mouth in its entirety. The volume of static coming from the laptop intensified.

Time disappeared as I savored what was inside me, not caring about anything except the flow of the static and the pulse of light on the other side of my closed eyelids. My tongue and lips worked and, accompanying a burst of static and a blast of pure, white light, my mouth was filled. 

I opened my eyes and parted my lips, letting the fluid drool down my chin onto my bare chest. This time, I wanted it on me. I wanted it to dry there. I wanted it to be the mark of this experience. I didnt want it to end.

The display on the laptop had changed. The waves and semicircles were still there, but the unmistakable shape of a person was being formed through different colors and wave patterns. On that shape were warm circles. I knew they meant.

Time went by and I put the hubs and switches and cords to use. The Thunderbolt cable was for my mouth. Mini USB plugs, with the aid of their lubrication, slipped underneath each eyelid. The Apple lightning connector fit into my urethra as if it had been built for that purpose; its length disappearing into me until there was no more left to go further. Multiple RJ-45 cords, thanks to an 8-port switch, nestled comfortably inside my rectum. My ears, of course, played home to the creamy white headphones while my nostrils and sinuses were packed with micro USB connectors. For the first time, I knew what it was like to be filled.

Colors and static burst from the laptop and my body hummed with electricity and incomprehensible bliss. During an infinitesimal moment of lucidity, I realized the sun was going down. During another, I noticed it was dawn. Then, with a burst of fluid and noise and brightness, it was over. And I felt empty. So, terribly empty.

Its three hours since that transcendental experience. The phone and laptop continued their dance, but I was no longer part of it. Everything inside me felt weak and useless. Everything, that is, except one part. 

An hour ago, at the peak of my despair, I made a small cut on my chest and pushed a micro USB plug inside. Right away, more circles appeared on the body shape onscreen. Lots more. I knew what I needed to do.

Ive spent this last hour slicing and inserting every cable I own into myself. My soft palate has been cored out and stuffed with Lightning cables. Ive invaginated my navel and filled it with ethernet cords and an HDMI cable. Inserted in the meat between my fingers and toes are the twisted pairs of ethernet cords I unbraided. I filled everything I could until I had nothing left to use. And I hope its enough.

I can feel the cords lubricating themselves inside me and the background of the screen as I type is a blur of warm pink and other, melting pastels. My vision is dimming and I know Ive lost too much blood to write much longer. Thats okay, though. Im done. Read this and know Ive met something else. Something much better than any person. Know were going to be together. Connected. And I pray some of you get to experience this yourselves someday. Youll never want anything else again.

<TITLE> Stay away from the Olympics in Rio </TITLE>

<TEXT> Stay away from the Olympics in Rio. Dont believe anything the officials are telling you. The filthy water is only a tiny part of it. Even the Zika virus is a tiny part. Theyre all pieces of a much larger whole thats more disturbing and horrible than anything I believed could exist. 

Im not some corporate whistleblower or disaffected government employee. I sell sports equipment. My company is one of the many allowed to sell our stuff in and around the Olympic venues. From the moment we arrived, though, we could tell something was amiss.

We expected security to be high. Everyone knows the Olympics is a high-value target for both international terrorists and local gangs. We expected checkpoints and frisking and all the other trademark procedures of a well-run operation. 

Our expectations were...off.

The security was draconian. Upon our arrival, we were strip searched. Cheek swabs were taken. Our luggage and cargo were poured out and pored over. It was pointless to argue. When we left the airport, soldiers with RPGs stood guard on every corner. Tanks were blocking some streets. Helicopters swarmed overhead. When we met up with our local guide, Julia, I asked her if something had happened or if someone had made a threat. She said no; itd been like this since the beginning.

We made our way across the city and eventually reached our hotel. It was quite decent, save for one major issue. If youve seen pictures of Rio, you may have noticed the stark contrast between rich and poor, with wealthy, highly-developed areas sitting literally next door to the most hideous poverty. While my room was clean and modern and the amenities were equivalent to those in any US hotel, the view from my room was of the favelas. I was sitting in my comfortable, air-conditioned room just 20 feet away from people who had almost nothing.

Julia, as it turned out, grew up in the neighborhood that my room overlooked. She knew the area quite well and even suggested we go there for dinner later in the evening. My business partner, Oliver, agreed. The other person wed brought with us, Michelle, who was in charge of our social media and web stuff, declined. She was exhausted.

After a nap frequently interrupted by the window-rattling passes of military helicopters, Julia collected me and Oliver and we headed into her old neighborhood.

Right away, Julia knew something was wrong. The streets, which should have been teeming with vendors and children, were empty. People sat in their homes or businesses, looking out the windows at us. We didnt say much as we made our way to the restaurant. 

We got there a few minutes later. It was tiny. Oliver said it looked like a kitchen in someones house. Thats because it is, Julia informed him. She chatted in Portuguese with the owner, Bethe, who was visibly pregnant and looked extremely hot and uncomfortable. 

Neither Oliver nor I speak a word of Portuguese. Still, we noticed they were repeating the same words and phrases. *Homem gordo* and *meninos*. I did a quick check in my pocket Portuguese-to-English dictionary, since there was no cell service to ask Google. Fat Man and Little Boy. I found that extremely bizarre, considering those were the names of the atomic bombs we dropped on Japan.

Julia and Bethe talked and talked while Bethes teenage daughter prepared our food. I have no idea what it was, but it was delicious. Julia didnt try to translate anything we were saying to Bethe, and Bethe didnt seem to care. Her discomfort was obvious. I found myself wanting to leave. Behind Bethes constant shifting of her weight and wiping of her brow, an element of fear lurked. Its difficult to explain, but its something anyone would know if they saw it. Bethe was afraid of whatever Fat Man and Little Boy were. 

After 90 minutes, we left. Before we could reach the hotel, there was a muffled explosion somewhere to our left. We all jumped. We stood there for a minute, then a mist of warm, putrid water rained down on us. It had to have been from the river the next block over. The same river Olympians would be using to compete in a few weeks. 

There was another, smaller explosion, followed by the sound of automatic rifle fire. Oliver and I were near panic, thinking we were under some kind of attack. Julia, though, just said its okay - its almost over. And she was right. 

The gunfire tapered off. We heard yelling coming from the direction of the explosions. Julia turned toward us.

Do you want to see one?

See what?, I asked.

Come on. Hurry.

We followed Julia without wanting to. A soldier with an RPG and two with M16s were standing on a small bridge spanning the river. Another one was taking something from the back of their truck. A heavy-duty fishing net.

The one with the RPG yelled something in our direction, but splashing from below redirected his attention. We reached the guardrail on the side of the road and looked down. 

What the fuck?, Oliver muttered, more to himself than to us.

A veiny, semicircular, diaphanous film covered the area below the bridge. It was riddled with bullet holes. At its center was a thick mass that looked like it had been severely burned. The whole thing twitched weakly, prompting another barrage of rifle fire. The twitching slowed, but didnt stop. 

The man with the RPG yelled at us again. Julia yelled back and the soldier just shook his head and didnt bother us again. The four of them lowered the net into the water and tried to scoop up what theyd been attacking.

It took a few tries, but they succeeded and started pulling it from the river. More of its body became visible as it left the water. Under the film were two long stalks which converged into one, thick piece. Another two stalks emerged, along with a bulb in the middle. I gasped.

The thing attached to the film was shaped like a person. At the peak of the torso was a wrinkled, microcephalic head. We could hear it making gurgling sounds as it was hauled over the edge of the bridge onto the road.

Julia grabbed us and walked quickly toward the bridge. Watch this, she demanded. We did. The soldiers looked at us with disgust, then one of them placed his rifle against the small, misshapen head. One shot rang out. All its twitching stopped. From the hole, a thick stream of smoke drifted into the sky.

No. Not smoke.

As the soldiers wrapped up the carcass and threw it in the back of the truck, I realized what was pouring from its head even after itd been bagged, causing the plastic to bulge from the pressure.

Mosquitos.

*Um menino*, Julia whispered.

Pokemon Go is a fun game when you dont live in an area devastated by industrial contamination and toxic waste. Pokemon Go is a fun game when the Poke Stops arent at local landmarks steeped in mercury and lead. Pokemon Go is a fun game when innocent gamers dont congregate in areas where the grass no longer grows because of carbon tetrachloride and dioxin and radionuclides in the soil.

For the kids in this city - and even for the adults in this city - Pokemon Go should be the kind of game to help them through the hell of their day-to-day lives. It should be a distraction from the omnipresent horror of living in a place thats no longer on anyones map - a place that the outside world thinks is better off forgotten. If only playing it wasnt killing them.

At the community hospital where I work, weve had a substantial increase in the number of patients displaying some effect of being poisoned: skin deterioration, pregnancy complications, respiratory distress, etc. - all consistent with the various environmental pollutants in different parts of town. Nearly all of those admitted have been Pokemon Go players. 

Our city council had a meeting with officials from the police and fire departments, hoping figure out a way to keep those dangerous locations off limits to visitors. Lots of ideas were floated, but they all got shot down. The city has no money to erect barriers or police the areas. Theres simply far too many of them. 

Signs started to go up. That was the one thing everyone on the council could agree on. The signs explicitly mentioned Pokemon Go and featured the frightening biohazard and radiation warning symbols. 

No one was deterred. The poisonings continued.

Id never played Pokemon in my life. I didnt know anything about it. As more and more people started to show up at the hospital, though, I got the impression I should get at least a basic grasp on what everyone was obsessed with. So, when I got home, I downloaded the app.

Right away, three of them showed up in my living room. I tapped a turtle-looking one and threw a ball at it. It was mine. Pretty cool, actually. Simple mechanics. There was a radar thing on the bottom right and three pawprints under silhouettes of other Pokemon I hadnt seen yet. I didnt have any idea where the things were in relation to me, and it seemed stupid that the radar was so worthless, but as I walked around, Id eventually run into one. Not one on the radar, mind you, but still one I hadnt seen before.

I started to understand why people enjoyed the game so much. I found myself wishing the residential areas had more Pokemon to catch. When I zoomed my map all the way out, in the distance, I could see those spinning blue towers - many of which were shooting out pink confetti. From what Id read online, thats where all the good Pokemon were. 

Its also where all the industrial contamination was.

When I got to work the next day, I was shocked to find one of those blue towers in the hospital. When I clicked it, the little blurb said it was in the childrens wing. I never go on that side of the building, but I figured what the hell and walked over. Once I was in range, I spun the wheel and all this stuff popped out: balls, potions, and even an egg! It said 10km on it. I threw the thing in my incubator, knowing itd probably hatch at some point on my shift. I do tons of walking.

Halfway through my day of walking up and down the labyrinthine halls, I checked my phone. Less than .4km. God damn it. A familiar alarm sounded and I rushed to the ER. Before I saw what had happened, I could smell it.

A group of teenagers had jumped the fence of the old battery factory. Apparently there are three Poke Stops inside, two of which are overlapping. The third, though, is inaccessible unless you go through the basement. The spot is a memorial for the company founder, and is located in the viewing area above a group of vats. As the factory deteriorated, the catwalk leading to the memorial had fallen. To reach the Poke Stop, the kids had traversed the profoundly toxic basement. They reached the Poke Stop without incident, but then one of them saw something called a Lapras on his radar.

One kid, David, headed in one direction, while his friends went in others. Whoever found the Lapras was going to yell and his friends could come catch it for themselves. It was David who found the Lapras. But it was also David who, in the process of yelling and gesturing to his friends, slipped.

When David slipped, he crashed into an unlabeled, rusty container. His friends saw the whole thing. The container, filled with contents that had corroded it over the years, burst. From the waist down, David was completely covered with a viscous, caustic combination of concentrated acid and various, unknown industrial toxins.

The friends received severe burns on their hands and arms when they hauled David out of the building and into the car. After they pulled the car up to the ER doors, a very kind, but very dumb, samaritan, whod been nearby, rushed to help. He made the mistake of grabbing David by his foot and ankle. He degloved Davids leg all the way to his crotch. The sloughed skin splashed onto the pavement as the samaritan screamed with horror, and then pain, as steam began to rise from his own hands.

Long, terrible story short: surgeons had to amputate everything below Davids ribcage. The rest of his skin was damaged beyond repair, leaving him covered with an otherworldly patchwork of hard, gray burns. His friends, as well as the dumb samaritan, lost their hands. Two of the ER rooms needed to be closed for 48 hours so they could be decontaminated. Of all the Pokemon Go accidents wed had in the short time following its release, it was the worst.

One might think the accident would deter other people from going to the industrial zones. Quite the contrary. Once people learned they could catch a Lapras near that factory, despite warnings and promises to arrest trespassers, trainers swarmed. They knew no one would be there to arrest them. Cops had better things to do.

Two days later, we had a handful of patients with burned lungs, a few with debilitating fatigue, and two pregnancy complications, both of which ended in miscarriages. The remains of the fetuses were indescribably deformed. How such deformities could occur in such a short period of time was beyond anyones guess.

I needed to take my mind off everything Id seen, so what did I do? I played Pokemon Go. I used the Poke Stop at the hospital frequently. Whenever I had a spare moment, Id go into the parking lot and catch pidgeys and ratattas. I yearned for the bigger, better Pokemon that I knew could be obtained from the old factories. I even drove up to the fence outside one and saw something huge on my radar, but I was too afraid for my own safety to get out and investigate. In the brief period I was sitting in my car out front, I watched six people hop the fence and run into the factory. I admit, I felt a little jealous. I forced myself to get over it.

Last night started like all the other nights since the game had been released, but turned into a tragedy felt hospital-wide. Lenisha Davis, whod undergone successful fertility treatments a few months prior, was expecting sextuplets - a first for our hospital. She was in excellent health and only a month away from her due date. Shed never played a second of Pokemon in her life, but her husband and son had. Lenisha never knew theyd frequented an abandoned factory that once made herbicides. Over the few days theyd gone and come back, Lenisha was walking barefoot on the toxins theyd tracked into the house.

The pain and bleeding that caused her to come to the hospital ended the same way as it had for the other pregnant women exposed to the toxins. The deformities of her miscarried sextuplets were hideous. Their complexions were albino and their limbs were gone. All that remained were round, hard blobs containing lidless, glaring eyes and fully-toothed, gaping mouths. Lenisha had to be sedated. She wouldnt stop screaming.

The image of the sextuplets stuck with me. I was scheduled for an overnight shift, and there was a free bunk where I couldve slept, but that was out of the question. I wandered the halls aimlessly, watching for Pokemon, and gathering supplies whenever I passed the Poke Stop.

Around 3 this morning, I saw a shape on my radar. It was a big one, and I think it was nearby. Two other, smaller ones, were also showing up. I speed-walked in all directions until I finally saw them appear on my map. I felt pretty lucky to have them all come at once. Seven balls later, Id captured all three. A horsea, a kakuna, and the big one was an exeggcute. 

I looked around. Id walked without paying attention to my location in the hospital. When I realized where Id gone, I shuddered. It was where abnormal specimens were dissected and tested. Dr. Ahad was working on one of the deformed miscarriages from the day before. To his side, about to go into the refrigeration unit, was a large biohazard bag containing Lenishas sextuplets.

Sorrow suffused through me as the scenario played out again in my head. As I stared, a feeling I cant explain pricked the hair on the back of my neck. My phone vibrated in my pocket. There was a Pokemon nearby. I checked the radar. It was the silhouette of a big round thing with two arms. I remember seeing that online when I was learning about the game. A geodude. 

I did my best to shake off my misery as I trawled the halls until the geodude showed up. I caught it, had a little moment of excitement from adding another entry to my Pokedex, then returned to my weariness and sorrow. I checked where I was. I was right in front of Davids room. He was on a ventilator and he was covered in bandages. Fluid kept seeping through his gray, cracked skin. A nurse was getting ready to change his gauze. I felt such sympathy for the kid. My eyes blurred with tears.

While my eyes welled up, I stared at the shape of David on the bed. Gray, with a round, hipless torso and two long arms. My breath caught in my throat. Before I knew it, I was running back to where Dr. Ahad had been working. The room was dark. Hed gone home for the night.

I scanned my keycard and let myself in. I opened the refrigeration units and removed the two bags of the miscarriages from the days before. One was shaped like a seahorse. Another looked like a cocoon. I thought back to the three Id caught right outside the room. 

My hands shook as I opened the larger cold box housing the remains of Lenishas sextuplets. The inside of the bag was coated with grayish-red slime and I couldnt see the contents. I put on gloves and made the sign of the cross. As tears ran down my face, I took out each horrifically-deformed fetus and arranged them on sample trays. My weeping turned to wracking sobs as I examined their features. Pink. Limbless. Wide eyed. 

Egg shaped.

Six in a row.

Im into dead stuff. Birds. Squirrels. Rabbits. The occasional deer. I dunno why, they just all do it for me. 

Oh, and just so all my cards are on the table with you folks, when I say do it for me, I mean sexually. Yeah.

Im not going to psychoanalyze myself and try to give some elaborate reason. Something tells me when you read this, youll do all that for me. No, as far as Im concerned, my attractions are victimless. Unconventional, but victimless. I wont be ashamed for being myself.

Theres a reason why Im writing this, of course. Its not to brag. Im fairly certain thatd be an exercise in futility. No, Im writing because theres something going on that I find particularly unsettling. Thats right: even I find something unsettling. So if that raises some alarms in your head, its probably for good reason.

I guess I need to take you through my process. I know, I know - just the kind of thing you want to read, right? Dont worry, Im not going to get into the sticky and salty bits. Well, maybe some of the sticky ones. Thats just unavoidable.

Lets say Im driving on Floridas Turnpike. Im about 50 miles south of Kissimmee near Yeehaw Junction. Only an hour from Disney! Ill be getting off the exit and Ill see a dead deer on the side of the road. One thats not all pulped up by an 18-wheeler. Tried those before; wont again. Anyway, Ill see the deer, Ill pull over, and Ill haul the guy or gal into the pickup. People drive by and see me doing it. Police officers and priests and school busses included. They dont care. Like I said: victimless.

With the deer in the truck, Ill head on home. Ive got a small place near the swamp. Its not too swampy; theres no alligators on the porch or kudzu in the kitchen. Its just your typical, rural Florida swampy. Basic swampy. 

Theres no neighbors for half a mile in all directions, unless you count armadillos. Armadillos, by the way, do not have a place in my bedroom. Only in my heart. Theyre beautiful animals. Regal, in their own special way. I apologize for my digression, but I just thought I had to mention that.

Ill haul the deer carcass out of the truck onto a picnic table Ive got over by the shed. Being in Florida, the likelihood of the animal being ripe is rather high. While Im not a fan of the smell, the ripening process brings what I call an added bonus to my new friend. 

When a dead animals been sitting out in the Florida sun, lots and lots of flies come and lay their eggs. And those eggs hatch. And what comes out is very...wriggly. Ill leave the rest to your imagination. But now were all caught up to where we need to be.

Yesterday afternoon, I had a buck on the picnic table. I dont know if itd gotten hit by a Smart car or Mini or whatever, but it was in pretty good shape aside from half its head lying in the road next to the main body. I didnt take that part. Like I promised, Ill spare you the details. 

After we did what couples do, I poked around for any other nooks or crannies that might have fly babies hidden away inside. To my utter delight, there were quite a few. Little pockets of what looked like squirmy rice. I made a mental note of all the pockets of delight and started doing some chores around the house.

A couple hours later, when I came back to my date, I was so surprised by what I found. All those pockets had grown huge! It looked like a few bowling balls had made craters in the poor guy. And those craters were full, and I mean full, of little fly worms. I know I said I enjoy the things because of their added bonus. However, at the rate they were going, I wouldnt have any deer left. Those guys usually last me a couple weeks before they get too gelatinous to provide the proper friction. TMI?

Ive gotta tell you: Ive never seen anything like that before. It was like the buck had bowls inside it and each bowl was filled to the brim with the fly worms. It wasnt a total loss, thankfully; there was still a good portion of lovable buck. But I needed to stop the spread. I went into the shed and got my blowtorch. I figured I could cauterize the biggest of the craters to stop them from getting too big, too fast. 

I felt bad having to torch the little guys, but I was in no mood to go out and look for another date so quick. Plus I didnt want to get dressed again. It was too hot and I like working around the house in the buff. Its very freeing. So, I just said heck it and clicked on the torch and started frying everything inside those craters. The little worms roasted down to nothing. And then, friends, the unsettling thing started to happen.

As soon as the fire hit the exposed meat of the buck, thousands of full-grown flies started to pour out. Right out of the meat, as if as soon as its blood started to boil, it turned to flies. I was so grossed out. Seriously. It was remarkably unpleasant. I dont like flies at all. I like their babies, but the grown-ups are too wild and annoying. Its kinda like how people like kittens but not cats.

I kept torching until the areas I wanted got cauterized, but I swear on my name at least a million flies had to come out of the buck. Once I was done, I snuffed the torch and heard something awful. It was loud, constant buzzing coming from above me. I looked up and all the flies that had come out were just hovering over me about ten feet up.

This scared me a little. Im a big guy and not much intimidates me, but for some reason, that cloud of flies just felt very wrong to me. 

Ready to hear the stupid thing I did? I was still holding the torch while I stared at the flies. It was off, but the end was still super hot from when I used it. Well, I was paying more attention to what was going on above me that I didnt really think about what I was doing with the torch. I turned around and, well, the tip of my hog slapped against the hot end of the torch.

Readers, I bet you heard me holler from your houses, no matter where it is you all live. I dropped the torch and grabbed myself, but even in my pain, I felt something pushing against my unit and my hands. I took one hand off, and about 50 flies poured out of the spot Id burned. I was scared out of my wits and then I remembered I hadnt washed any of the buck off me after our date. There had to be something wrong with its blood. 

I ran in the house and put some ice on my burn. From the kitchen window, I watched all the flies still hovering above the buck. The ones thatd come out of me were buzzing around my ceiling. And then, out of nowhere, they all popped. Thats the only word I can use. They popped and covered the buck and me and my kitchen floor with what looked and felt like blood, but I dont know how the hell it could have been. Shoot, I dont know how any of this could have been.

Now, I was still more concerned about my burn than the mess on my date and my kitchen floor, so I tended to that for the rest of the evening. I covered up my burn, took a shower, which is remarkably hard to do when trying not to get your genitalia all wet, and went to bed.

I woke up in the middle of the night because my burn was bothering me. I headed into the kitchen to get another ice pack, and when I turned on the light, I was surprised to see the floor where the blood had landed was covered in mushrooms. Weird, thin ones that were whitish-gray. I flipped on the outside lights and, lo and behold, the dirt and picnic table and shed were covered with the same things. My date, too. I knew at that point he was a lost cause. Poor guy.

My burn kept flaring and I had to take a leak, so I headed into the bathroom. The damn light bulb had blown out the week before and I kept forgetting to pick up a new one. I pulled my shorts down around my ankles, peeled off my bandage, and sat down. I was too tired to stand and didnt want to risk missing the bowl in the dark. I started to relieve myself. Except nothing came out. And it hurt a whole heck of a lot.

I strained a little, but not too hard. I didnt want to blow anything out. I started to get worried about my prostate. I got up, waddled out of the bathroom back into the kitchen the light was on, and hollered again. There was a cluster of those same stringy mushrooms sprouting from the burned tip of my penis. When I tried to pull them out, I felt something tugging way, way deep inside my groin. It hurt a lot and I didnt want to mess up my downstairs any more than it already was.

So thats why Im writing you guys. Sorry for the long story, but I just thought you needed to hear the details so you could give an informed opinion. Any idea what I should do? Ive gotta pee real bad and those mushrooms keep getting longer and longer.

<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4j23w5/far_too_many_mushrooms/?st=iqcgb0kj sh=d61331d2)

After all the schools and municipal cafeterias stopped taking shipments of wild mushrooms from the county co-op, they all came to my company for us to use. Normally, this would be fantastic. Mushrooms make great fertilizer. 

Ive got acres upon acres of property with great soil. Its such good stuff that people come from all over the country in dump trucks to buy a load and haul it back to wherever they want. Our familys been caring for the land for going on 200 years now. Weve been asked to sell the property to big agribusinesses more times than we can count, but we could never give it up. Even when the offers got into the upper seven figures, weve been content with the low sixes that come in consistently, year after year.

I got a phone call a month ago from the farm co-op thats been handling all the local produce for the countys schools and whatnot. Apparently theres been no interest in the mushroom glut after little Danny Lansings tragic passing. The co-op guy on the phone told me what I already knew: the boys death was from an unknown allergic reaction and no one else, as far as he knew, had gotten sick from the mushrooms. I listened and waited for him to tell me what kind of deal hed give me if I were to buy the whole supply.

Ill admit, I was pretty surprised when he said he wasnt even considering charging me for the supply. To the contrary: he said the co-op would give me five thousand bucks if I sent our trucks over to take them all away. $5000 sounded like a hell of a lot for a local farm co-op, and when I said that to the guy, he just said well, its a hell of a lot of mushrooms.

Two of my guys, Ramon and Juan, headed over to the co-op; one in a dump truck and the other in a backhoe. Ramon and his dump truck were the first to arrive, and he radioed to me the minute he saw the amount of product theyd have to move. I called in two more guys and sent them with another two dump trucks. When all was said and done, theyd picked up eight truckloads. I let them split the $5000 among themselves.

The last half of the truckloads were delivered after dark, so even though I knew I was getting tons of the things, I was still taken aback in the morning when I saw the mountains of fungus sitting in the field near the barn. I went over to investigate, and saw the majority of them looked like portobellos, but there were some stringy, white ones in there that looked a little like the Japanese kind I cant remember the name of.

The four guys whod helped out yesterday were there at the crack of dawn. They hadnt expected such a huge bonus yesterday, so they were eager to get to work and show their appreciation. Ive always believed its important to treat the people who you employ with respect. These guys have been with us for a long time; Juan had just celebrated his 30th year here. Without them, the company wouldnt be nearly as good as it is. I make sure to tell them that as often as I can.

They got to work loading the mushrooms into a huge grinder thats been part of the business for almost a century. It eats through any organic matter you feed into it and turns it into the perfect size and consistency to get incorporated into the soil. Five hours later, two piles of mushrooms had been reduced to a pulpy sludge.

I worked out which part of the property should get the new fertilizer, and as luck would have it for the guys who had to spread it out, the area right near where theyd been working had gone the longest without upkeep. After two days, that part of the field was all finished. Just in time for the weekend.

No one was around from Saturday until Tuesday. I told the guys my wife and I were going to take a few day trips to enjoy the unseasonably-warm weather, and I had them take Monday off. We got back in the wee hours of Tuesday. Long before sunrise. It felt like Id just gotten to sleep when I heard banging on the door. My cell phone started ringing, too. I picked up and Pedro started yelling in my ear. My ability to understand Spanish is okay, but not when its being spoken at a hundred miles an hour and being half shouted. I told Pedro to calm down and asked if his dad was available to talk. I love the kid, but hes pretty excitable. I guess all 16 year olds are.

Juan got on the line as I walked over to the front door. Ramon was standing there looking bewildered. Juan was saying something about mushrooms on the phone as Ramon pulled me by the arm around to the other side of the house, near the field where theyd been working. I saw Pedro first, then Juan, still talking into his cell phone. Id stopped listening, though. I could see something in the newly-fertilized field about a hundred yards away, but it was being blurred by a haze of orange fog.

The four of us walked toward the field. I started to get a nagging feeling of unease. There were large, bulbous shapes protruding from the ground. Even as we closed in, their clear shapes eluded us. The dark-orange fog still obscured the details. Ramon pointed out footprints in the dirt, all converging on that part of the field. The more I looked, the more I saw. Tens of pairs of footprints. 

Orange fog licked at our feet and ankles and legs as we got closer. I put my shirt over my mouth and nose before walking any closer. The rest of the guys did, too. The footprints appeared to come from all around, all spaced out as if they were running. Wed gotten close enough to make out the bulbous forms. They were some kind of fungus. They looked like giant pieces of ginger root sticking out of the ground. Their sides were lined with pores, some open, some covered with a loose membrane.

Out of nowhere, Pedro screamed and put his hands to his face, dropping his shirt from his mouth in the process. I saw him gasp in a lungful of the fog. My eyes widened when I saw what had startled him. Bodies were wrapped around the base of each mushroom stalk, as if they were embracing them. Their skin was destroyed. I cant think of any other way to put it. Massive patches were missing, usually a foot or more in diameter in each spot. And there were many, many spots. 

The most unsettling aspect, though, as if it could get much worse, was the condition of their feet. Some of them were in tatters; bones sticking out of shredded muscle and veins dangling like thick, loose hair. I dont know what could have possibly happened - it almost looked like they were worn away.

We heard loud breathing behind us and we spun around. A hideously thin woman, completely naked and patterned with areas of missing flesh, ran by us. One of her feet was missing. Each step pushed the stump of her ankle into the dirt. She ran face-first into one of the mushrooms, wrapped her arms around it, and sank to the ground with a smile on her face. As her arms slid across the pores in the stalk, they burst open, filling the air with more orange fog.

The men with me were all talking loudly to one another and backing away. More runners in similarly-devastated conditions were arriving. We kept walking away and out of the orange fog. Juan called Pedros name. I noticed he wasnt with us. He called again. Pedro came out of the fog, coated, like we were, with orange spores. Unlike us, though, his mouth and nose were still uncovered. He stared blankly and scratched at his face and neck.

Juan rushed toward his son and started pulling him away from the field, but Pedro turned toward it and began to walk back. Juan, being much stronger, was still able to pull the boy back out of the field to the barn, where we all stripped down and hosed one another off. We stood in the middle of the barn wondering aloud what the hell was happening. 

Pedro, now clean, kept scratching himself. Lines had started to form over the spots where his fingernails had traveled. His legs pumped as he ran in place, not listening to his father ordering him to stay still. A moment later, while Juan was trying to call 911, we watched, helplessly, as Pedro started running in the direction of the mushroom field, slamming into the closed door of the barn, picking himself up, and doing it all again. And again. And again.

<TEXT> During the latter half of her pregnancy, Eileen was plagued by nightmares. They were monstrous and intrusive; disruptive to the point where shed been unable to continue working because of the stress of it all. The trouble began when Eileen saw the sonogram image of our baby. Our daughter, we learned. While neither the obstetrician nor I could see what Eileen claimed to, she was convinced it was something evil. Something non-human. Despite my best efforts, I couldnt get her to shake that feeling. And thats when the nightmares began.

Shed say she heard the baby laughing inside her. Laughing and screaming. Eileen would wake up in a panic and describe hideous scenes of a deformed monstrosity erupting from her body and devouring humankind. I could tell my wife was traumatized, but there was nothing I could do except hold her until the hysterical sobbing stopped.

At the request of her parents, Eileen began seeing a therapist. The therapy seemed to take the edge off her daily trauma, but the nightmares persisted. Id wake up to Eileen thrashing and clawing at herself, drawing deep gashes into the stretched flesh of her belly while screaming with profound terror at whatever was tormenting her. She began wearing mittens to bed to diminish the severity of the assaults on herself. They succeeded in stopping the scratches, but the horror continued unabated.

We were both counting down the days to her delivery date. Most parents do this with joyful anticipation. Our anticipation was anything but. Eileen had grown resigned to the idea that she was about to bring something evil into the world. I was secretly dreading how Eileen would treat the baby. Shed told me many times how much she hated her; how shed been praying our daughter would arrive stillborn and unable to hurt anyone. 

On June 30th, Eileen went into labor. I could tell she was in excruciating pain, but she never cried out or complained. Her jaw was set with determination and her eyes had locked on a point in space only she could see. Throughout the whole ordeal, she didnt utter a word. 17 hours later, on July 1st, our daughter was born. Dominique Alyssa Texier. 

And she was perfect.

When small, cooing Dominique was brought up for Eileen to hold, she stared at her for long, silent minutes. She blinked over and over, as if trying to determine if what she was seeing was real or imaginary. Dominique reached out and touched Eileens nose. The tension broke. Eileen began to cry. It wasnt the terrified bleating that had filled our last four months. These were tears of infinite relief. Eileen held Dominique and kissed the top of her head. At that instant, I knew my wife loved our daughter. And I loved them both infinitely. 

Two days later, the three of us went home. Our love for our newborn daughter has only deepened. The feeling is indescribable. Id always heard parents say theyd do anything for their children, but I could never understand the ferocity of that dedication until Dominique came into our lives. 

Her wide, gray eyes stare into ours with precocious intensity. As the hours and days of Dominiques new life accumulate, I can feel our dedication and reverence growing. When she smiles at us, which is more often than not, her tiny, straight teeth - another example of her precociousness - gleam with a radiance that reflects the brightness of her parents sentiment.

Dominique bathes in the adoration pouring from the two pairs of eyes observing her every waking moment. Every need she has, however infinitesimal, is met. Every action she performs, however inconsequential, is celebrated. Even now, as we watch her breastfeed, it seems like the most beautiful, natural act in the world. The only concern we have is what we should do once she finishes eating the second one.

<TEXT> For the last month, Id been pestering Mason to come with me to explore the old mine outside town. It was one of those places everyone said was haunted. You know the type. Of course, most places like that have scary legends to keep people away so the goth kids can go and fuck one another in peace. There was nothing really haunted about those spots, of course. This mine, though, kept even the goths at bay.

There were so many rumors about why the mine was haunted and downright dangerous. Some said it used to be a government uranium mine during the Manhattan Project and youd get irradiated the minute you set foot inside. Others claimed Blacks had been secretly imprisoned and tortured to death there after the abolition of slavery, and their vengeful ghosts would kill anyone foolish enough to explore. For the most part, however, folks didnt know why the place was so ominous. Theyd just always been told never to go in, and they obeyed.

No one Id ever met had boasted about going inside. A couple people had the balls to peek through the cracks in the wood theyd used to board up the place 50 years ago, but that was as far as anyone would go. Not even the cops would go in when asshole kids would prank call the station and say someone had gotten lost in there. Honestly, the whole thing seemed pretty fucking lame. Ive never been superstitious. I couldnt care less about ghosts of dead slaves or some ridiculous rumors about radiation. All the evidence said it was nothing but an old coal mine thatd been decommissioned before it could get finished. Thats it. And I was going in.

Mason always resisted when I tried to get him to come. I couldnt believe how much of a coward he was. Id always known he was shy and timid, but this was just pathetic. Why I was in a relationship with him in the first place was anyones guess. Well, I know why: he gave me free weed and coke. He stopped dealing and got a real job a month ago, though. Hed done nothing but annoy me ever since. Tonight was going to be the last straw. If he bailed on me, I wouldnt go near him again.

He didnt bail. Thank God. We showed up at the mine at sunset. Wed brought the flashlights and stuff to explore, plus some food in case we got lost. That last part was his idea. He seemed under the impression wed be gone long enough that starvation would be a concern. Such a baby.

I had him tear the bottom boards away with a little crowbar, and while he whined and protested, I crawled under the remaining barrier and into the mine. His bleating went on and on but he eventually squeezed through the opening and joined me inside. We shone our flashlights ahead and looked at the solid rock wall in front of us and the sharp turn to the left. Lets go, I told him.

We walked forward and turned the corner. Mason let out a long sigh. All there was in front of us was a shaft going straight down. There were some elevator cables at the top, but no car. No ladder, either 

I guess the scary stuffs down there, Mason announced, his voice echoing down the shaft. No way we can climb down, right? The relief in his voice was obvious.

I paced aimlessly while he talked about how he couldnt believe the town was scared of such a boring place. I cleared my throat and spoke:

Darryl wants you to know you promised to work for him forever, Mason. And you shouldnt have stopped.

I was behind Mason when I finished the sentence and I pushed him. He tried to grab me, but Id backed up. He spun around and toppled backward from the lip of the shaft. His hands tried to grasp the edge, but it was all loose dirt and sand. Mason screamed all the way down. The wet crunch came a little while later.

I turned around and headed back to the opening, thinking about how proud of me Darryl was going to be. Wed talked about this ever since Mason got his stupid job. Now I could be with Darryl and he could treat me like the princess I know I am.

While I rounded the corner, a shrieking chorus of dissonant voices erupted from from the elevator shaft. I gasped and ran for the exit. And as I scrambled under the barrier, despite my blood jackhammering in my ears and my panicked yelps filling the air, I clearly heard the words, 

THANK YOU - WEVE BEEN SO HUNGRY.

<TEXT> Ive been selling ground meat and sausage made from the people Ive killed to the hipster restaurants in the city. You know the type: ones with terms like LOCALLY SOURCED INGREDIENTS emblazoned on every surface like it somehow makes their food taste good. Not that what Im selling them tastes bad, mind you. They love it. Everyone does. They think theyre getting some of that heritage-breed pork from those wooly Mangalitsa pigs Ive got in the yard. Well, theyre not. Those little guys arent for sale. The restaurants are buying and serving human remains. 

Let me guess: Im a monster. Oooooooo. Another madman killing innocent people, right? Another psychopath? Well, no. Maybe. Probably not. Heres the thing - its not that I dont *like* people. I know everyone has hopes and dreams and blah blah blah. 

I had hopes and dreams too. I had a butcher shop and loyal customers for 40 years. Then all the kids started moving in. White kids just out of college. Kids with jobs in technology or some other abstract shit that pays an ungodly amount of money; five times what everyone else in our neighborhoods were making. Kids without a care in the world for the generations of culture they were trampling on.

Rents went up. Fast. Our neighborhoods changed. Fast. Family businesses thatd been operating for years couldnt afford to stay there anymore and were forced to shut down. After just ten years, the city was nothing like it had been. Gentrification was the word that kept getting thrown around. People talked about it like it was a good thing.

I was lucky. I had a nest-egg saved up and didnt even try to keep paying the rent as it skyrocketed. I saw where it was all going. I closed the shutters on my shop, bought some land upstate, had the foresight to acquire some Mangalitsas before they became popular and expensive, and started my little company. Once a month, Id drive my van around the old neighborhoods on late Friday and Saturday nights. Id invite the stumbling, drunken kids to get in for a ride, hit them over the head, and head on back to the farm. Easy peasy Mangalitsy. 

Anyway, the great thing about these hipster joints is the owners will cut whatever corners they can if it means they can get an edge on a new or hot product. What does that mean for me? Well, they drive up early Monday morning, buy the meat from me without any USDA stamp, and head on back to the city with a weeks worth of meat. That leaves me with cash in hand and great dirt on the restaurant owners if they ever learn my little secret. 

According to one of my buyers - a guy whose claim to fame was when he Beat Bobby Flay on TV - the next big thing will be meat from suckling pigs; baby piglets whove only consumed milk from their mothers. I glanced at his wife, who hed brought to show her a real farm and to see how the other half lives. She nodded absently while cradling a tiny newborn to her chest. Her own little suckling animal. 

The guy went on and on about the quality of unweaned, milk-fed product. He went through the recipes hed planned out. They sounded pretty great, to be honest. Lots of fresh fennel. I love fennel.

I pictured the people bound and gagged in their pens in my basement. Three men and nine women. Basic arithmetic and logistics made me close my eyes for a moment as I thought about how Id fill the order. The guy talked as I worked out the numbers. 

Ill be happy to pay you in advance for not only the product, but for exclusivity, he told me. We strolled around the pigpens as his wife worried aloud about whether the baby could get sick from the smell.

11 months, I announced. The guy smiled. Apparently hed expected a year or more. I shook his weak, uncalloused hand, nodded at his politely-smiling wife, and patted the infant on its little, pink head. They drove off in their Volvo, leaving me with a bag of cash.

Once they were long gone, I headed down to the basement. I thought about the orders I had to fill over the next few months, then slit the throats of the two smaller men and hung them up to drain. I shifted the rest of them around in their pens until I had the grouping I wanted.

As I was heading back upstairs, I turned around and called out to the remaining man, who was sitting in the corner of the pen housing him and his four companions. 

Better start fucking, buddy! Your children are my future!

<TITLE> In our quest to drill for more and more oil, I think we finally went too deep. Part 1. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ive worked in petroleum engineering for 35 years. Most of it has been in the Gulf of Mexico, though Id done a bit of contract work in the Middle East and Canada. After the BP disaster, thered been quite a bit of pressure on the major petroleum companies to use extra caution and increase their R D budgets to design safer technologies to prevent another environmental catastrophe. For most of the people in my position, that meant more work and less pay. Of course.

My most recent employer has been one of the big American oil companies. Ive been stationed on an experimental, semi-secret offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico. I say semi-secret because were using a lot of new, highly-proprietary technologies. If our competitors were to learn about them, wed be set back a few years and countless billions of dollars. All outward appearances would suggest were a normal platform thats outfitted for extreme-depth drilling. If only the competition knew how deep we were going.

The platform is right near the edge of the drop off leading to the Sigsbee Abyssal Plain. One of the new technologies weve employed involve our remotely-operated submersibles. Theyre basically just submarine drones with lots of cameras and equipment on them that can go super deep. All the ones wed used in the past needed to be tethered to the surface using a fiber optic connection. 

The physical connection had its pros and cons. Fiber optic connections are speedy as all hell, which means commands and data can be sent back and forth to the drone with no meaningful lag. A major downside, though, is that a physical cable limits the maneuvering capabilities of the drone. At the depths we were hoping to reach, the topography was unknown. Previous attempts to send tethered drones ended in failure when the cables were severed by the terrain.

Even with our best satellite, sonar, and early-drone imagery, our knowledge of the area we wanted to drill was terrible. The resolution was too low for any meaningful data to be gleaned. We knew there was oil down there - lots and lots and lots of it - but until we could develop new ways to map the bottom, we were screwed.

A guy named Masaharu Ajibana changed everything for us. Hed been a materials scientist wed brought on to work on some of the ceramics composites in our drill heads. When he saw the new, undisclosed materials wed been wanting to employ in the future drills, he mustve spent four straight days poring over their properties with an enthusiasm Id never seen in a person over the age of five. 

At the end of those four days, Masaharu not only understood the materials better than the team who invented them, but hed gotten an idea about how to transmit data through miles and miles of murky saltwater using some bizarre form of piezoelectric resonance unique to the properties of the new ceramics. Essentially, a transceiver on the drone would resonate at the same frequency as one on the platform. Once the transceivers were locked in an oscillatory pattern, smaller, tighter waveforms from a second set of transceivers would traverse the oscillation cable linking the drone and the platform. 

Nearly every scientist in every department in the company said this was entirely impossible. Still, there was enough support from a few key players in R D that Masaharus claims were investigated. Investigation led to cursory confirmations. Cursory confirmations led to experiments. Experiments led to shocking successes. And shocking successes led to the fastest development and deployment of a new technology in the history of the company. 

Its that technology our company employed three weeks ago. Wed been using a fleet of nine drones to map the abyssal plain of Sigsbee Deep. Theres one hub drone and eight mappers. The hub has one main resonator which communicates with the platform, and eight smaller ones which communicate with the mappers. We were dumbfounded not only by the simplicity and ease of the data transmissions, but by the richness of the data we were seeing.

Another technology wed deployed for this project was a small, cable-form drill mounted on the mappers. Its drill head was equipped with our new ceramics and could cut through the bottom of the plain with ease. The cables were 3000 feet long - not anything major - but they allowed the mappers to confirm the massive salt sheet wed assumed was covering the oil deposits. 

Once the drill cable maxes out, a tiny device gets deposited in the cavity. Its mostly multilevel sonar with some seismographs and embedded communicators. Nothing too advanced. It measures minute seismic activity and sends it back to the hub. The data gets processed by our CPU cluster and is incorporated into our future drilling plans.

As I said, weve been mapping for three weeks. A week ago, the seismographs started picking up some bizarre activity. And something else happened. Its something neither I nor the onboard medics can adequately explain. 

Last Tuesday, Gervaso Zaragoza, a member of my team, went to the infirmary complaining of severe headaches. He had no history of migraines and until the headaches started, seemed to be in perfect health. The severity of the pain grew as the day went on. After a couple hours, he was screaming. When I stepped out of the infirmary, another team member came to me and casually mentioned the seismic activity of the plain had been rising all day. On a whim, I asked him to send a sleep command to the seismographs. A minute later, Gervaso was fine.

We resumed the operation of the seismographs later in the afternoon. Gervaso, who was resting but otherwise alert, was unaffected. I knew it had to be a coincidence and did my best to put the event out of my mind.

On Wednesday, the mappers were spread in a wide circle out from the hub. They were pinging the interior of the circle with extremely high-resolution sonar, as well as multi-laser topography measurements as the circle widened. The goal was to see if there had been any appreciable surface shifts since the last measurement three days earlier. With the seismic activity wed experienced, Id expected some shifts to be detected. 

There were no shifts. Instead, there were a series of long, unbroken convexities lining the sea floor. The scan resolution was extremely sharp, and we could clearly see the digitized images of straight lines pushing nearly a meter above the plain. Even with the scans, I wanted to see a camera feed, so I directed the camera to send a raw feed to the platform. The light on the drone went on, and the screen displayed a long, perfectly-straight mound in the silt that stretched for miles. The other mappers displayed the same thing.

The onboard geologist wouldnt rule out the possibility of a seismic event being the cause of the convexities. He said we knew very little about the seismological properties of the salt plate beneath the plain. The pressures of the silt and water above it and the oil and gas below made for an intensely complicated interaction model, and even though hed never heard of the type of thing we were seeing, instances of symmetry in natural geology were well-known. He mentioned the basalt formations at Giants Causeway. And thats how he left it. 

I wasnt convinced. Even though Im not a geologist, it seemed odd that such obvious and large changes could occur with the comparatively-little seismic activity wed seen. Even though the activity had increased as wed observed it, it still hadnt come close to reaching an intensity that would have moved such a large amount of rock and water. 

Two days later, on another mapping mission, I took manual control of one of the drones. Id had the guys from robotics outfit another couple cameras and lights to the outside. I guided the sub along the tallest of the convexities and positioned it about a foot above its surface. All the cameras and lights traced along the convex surface. No visible change from the other day.

I extended the drill. The drill head sank into the convexity and stopped. It was stuck. The transceivers on the hub reported error transmissions from the mapper. I reversed the drill, backed it out, and tried again. Throughout the platform, I heard a number of sharp reports that sounded like gunshots. In the other room, shouts of surprise and screams of fear rang out. I ran from the control panel to see what was going on.

John Edmundson was lying on the floor. A hole had appeared in his belly. A sucking sound filled the room coupled with John screaming with an intensity Ive never known to be possible. He moved his hands to the wound in an attempt to plug it, but with a series of horrible, wet cracks, his hands and arms were pulled into his belly. Above him, a hole exploded in the steel ceiling, its ragged edges pointing downward. I realized John was being pulled down to the deck below. 

I ran down the steps and watched with profound horror as the man was pulled through a series of holes the size of dimes, all the way through every floor in the platform, down to the water. I ran down each floor, watching the column of gore disappear ever downward. Two minutes later, a foam of pulp and entrails floated in heap on the choppy surface of the water.  

I slowly plodded back up the steps, unsure if what Id just seen could possibly have been real. I was jolted out of my contemplation when I realized, behind the shrill voices of my coworkers, an alarm was screaming from the drone control room. I ran back upstairs, past my traumatized colleagues, and made it to the control room. The camera feed was gone.

I rewound to the moment Id left from the room and started at the screen with disbelief. The convexity below the drone shook like an electric shock had coursed through its bulk. Then, the silt covering it began to fall away. It wasnt a rock formation. Ripples of peristaltic convulsions seethed along a gray, scarred surface. A hole opened in the surface of it and the drill cable began to get sucked inside. As the 3000 feet were being consumed, the camera showed a vacant column the width of a dime pointing straight up. I realized that mustve been what had killed John.

Once the drill cable disappeared, the screen went black. The drone, presumably, was gone. The other drones were still mapping away with mechanical obliviousness. I called up the real time sonar data. The convexities had disappeared from the sea floor. I pulled back on the sonar map and tried to figure out what I was seeing. The sonar feed was slow; around 2 frames per second. Still, there was no mistaking what was coming on screen.

The convexities had all lifted from the abyssal plain and were waving back and forth through the water. They were massive; easily 7000 feet long. I couldnt figure out what was causing them to move. Then, as the reality of Johns death started to sink in and the strangeness of what the camera showed before it went out began to take hold in my mind, I came to a realization that was impossible to ignore. What I was seeing wasnt an effect of bizarre, deep-sea geology. They were colossal, writhing tentacles.

Id completely forgotten about Myspace. Like, Id forgotten it even existed. Never mind the fact I used it like a fiend at the peak of its popularity and I had countless photos and messages and connections still there, frozen in time, so anyone could see what a disaster I was in my early 20s. A couple weeks ago, I got an email warning me about some major hack that resulted in tons and tons of accounts being compromised; a compromise so severe that for some people, every shred - every bit - every datum - of their personal information could have been stolen. Then I remembered Myspace.

My early 20s were a bad time for me. I was dealing with a number of undiagnosed mental illnesses. Still, back then, I never thought anything was wrong with me at all; I just figured thats how I was. I was a sad person. I was a volatile person. Not once did it cross my mind I had legitimate problems for which potential solutions existed. Instead, for years, I bathed in static and lassitude interrupted by bursts of rage and terror.

One thing I was acutely aware of was how miserable I felt. Unfortunately, I had no positive outlets for that feeling. My creativity was nonexistent. I couldnt write my way out of a bad mood or compose music to take the edge off my self-directed anger. Instead, when things were at their worst, I sought simple, hedonistic escapes. Sometimes it was as innocent and selfish as overeating or staring at porn, but when Myspace came around and a vast social network of people came into view, my methods of escape changed.

A total non-secret but still-unpleasant thing to discuss in polite company is how social networks magnificently facilitate the meetings of damaged people seeking others to help damage them even more. Within a week of figuring out and forming a rudimentary network on Myspace, Id started looking for kindred spiritless.

Before I could find one, one found me. Bethany. Bethany was unwell. Like me, she was a cutter. Unlike me, Bethany cut her face. And her neck. Her skin bore a lattice of old scars and fresh wounds sprinkled with middle-aged scabs. Her frame was slight and fragile. All her photos were taken from angles to maximize her bones, whether cheek, collar, or hip. Her message was simple: Can we meet up and talk?

Her profile said she lived in a town 20 miles away. I had a car, she didnt. I drove over that night, not knowing what to expect other than probable sex and likely sobbing.

I was right about the former but not about the latter. Bethany was the flattest, most unaffected person Id ever encountered. The sex itself was brisk and clinical; an emotionless pursuit of mutual, involuntary muscle contractions. Nothing more. Afterward, we talked. 

Bethany was the product of two decades of ceaseless, hideous abuse. It began with her stepfather when she was a toddler and continued across multiple relationships before culminating in a suicide attempt and a six-month hospitalization two years before we met. In the space of those post-hospital years, Bethany dedicated herself to the gradual process of self-destruction. Thanks for the help, she told me.

It took a lot to surprise me back then, but the matter-of-fact declarations of Bethanys professed desire for a slow, torturous death took me aback. I stared at the fresh slices right below her hairline that shed made during her trip to the bathroom after sex. A feeling I can only describe as intense respect and admiration filled me. I produced my pocket knife, opened it, and while Bethany watched, I carved a thin, deep line into the flesh above my right eyebrow.

The cut wept and trickled in a lazy rivulet down the side of my face. For the first time since Id met her, a tiny smile lifted the edges of the scabs around Bethanys lips. She leaned forward, and with a gentleness I can only describe as angelic, swept her searing tongue from the base of my neck and into the drooling wound above my eye. Right when the sharp sting hit me, she moved down and slipped her blood-bathed tongue into my mouth.

And that was the first time I met Bethany.

We grew close over the following weeks. When we werent together, we were chatting on Myspace. Shed introduced me to a concept of physical intimacy Id never even considered, let alone desired. But after our first night together, it was all I wanted to think about. It was all I wanted to talk about. And Bethany, for her part, was delighted to indulge me. Anyone reading our chats out of context would think theyd encountered a corrupted file containing meshed conversations between teen romance enthusiasts, gynecologists, and butchers.

By necessity, our physical interactions, while intensely sadomasochistic, were tamer than that which wed chat about. Months flew while we ratcheted up the intensity of our online discussions and did our best to follow our talk with action in the bedroom. But as time passed, we realized wed hit a wall. 

Neither of us were willing to do severe, lasting damage to each other. Wed cut, wed burn, wed bite, wed dilate; but nothing permanent. Nothing debilitating. And that began to weigh on our relationship. Following a night of spilled and leaked fluids and burned and bruised erogenous zones, Bethany told me what Id both expected and dreaded. She needed more. I nodded and left.

Five days went by without either of us talking. Id given up hope and had slipped into the familiar, benthic depths of abject loneliness. The prospect of suicide was a bright, hopeful beacon of relief. On the sixth day, Bethany messaged me. Please come over one last time. I was at her doorstep 15 minutes later.

When she let me in, I saw why shed invited me. A dissonant sensation of arousal, fear, and nausea caused my knees to weaken and I sank heavily onto her bed. 

The night we met, when Bethany was telling me about the abuse shed endured over the course of her life, shed mentioned how her mother left her stepfather when Bethany was 16 and she hadnt seen him since. Her mother said he still lived in the same county, but fell headlong into his drug and alcohol addiction following the divorce. And now, back at Bethanys apartment, I discovered Bethany had lured him there.

He was emaciated and obviously quite sick. While I was surprised Bethany had been able to overpower him and bind his arms and legs, the smell of alcohol on the man made me think he didnt put up a fight. He probably didnt even know where he was.

You know, Bethany said, looking into my eyes, we dont have any pictures of us together on our MySpace accounts. Everyone else in a relationship does. We should too.

My heart soared. She still wanted to be in a relationship with me.

As the man on the floor groaned and drooled around the sock in his mouth, Bethany sat on my lap in her computer chair and we posed in front of her webcam. We snapped photo after photo, losing our clothing and inhibitions with each shot. My knife split her lower lip and she bit through mine. We kissed with a passion I never knew could be possible, pausing every minute or so to take more pictures. I knew theyd be removed from public view by Myspace, but I didnt care. Wed still be able to see them privately. We were the only ones who mattered.

We stopped, our chests heaving as we worked to catch our breaths, and Bethany started to caption the pictures. I looked at the man on the floor. Bethany, sensing that my attention had shifted, stopped captioning and followed my gaze. We both stared at the writhing, wretched molester and abuser. 

No one will miss him. No one will look.

Bethanys voice melted in my ear like warm tallow. My mind raced through all the online conversations wed had with one another; fantasies that spliced bedrooms and abattoirs, speculums and chisels, sex organs and offal. The raw savagery of my self-loathing coupled with an intense sense of duty to Bethany. I wanted to show her how much she meant to me.

I dragged the man into the bathtub and opened him while Bethany watched. I unpacked and unfolded that which he contained, feeling the weight and texture of each bit before passing it to Bethany for inspection. She considered every piece with her hands and eyes; the knife travelling over it all in intricate, discerning swirls. The mood was broken only once when the man had a moment of lucidity, was able to free one hand, and tried to pull his parts back inside. I borrowed the knife from Bethany. A moment later, the stepfather would never try grab anything again.

Hours passed and Bethany and I reshaped the abuser into a form that was no longer recognizable. No longer threatening. When the last portion was excised, we made quiet love among the debris. Our act was shrouded in peaceful silence broken only by gentle sighs and the sticky coupling and decoupling of our crimson-kissed bodies. Id never experienced such closeness. When it was over, we drifted into a peaceful sleep.

Once we woke up, we did what we had to do. Following the ten hours it took to clean, remove, and bury the parts where they would never be found, Bethany kissed me goodbye and I returned home.

That night was the peak of our relationship. We attempted to rekindle the passion through our usual, explicit online conversations, recalling moments of that night in detail which, before experiencing the reality of it, would have been more than enough to provoke our mutual desire. The provocation didnt come. The desire remained unavailable. After another month, wed stopped talking entirely.

I attempted to contact Bethany a few times later in the year. When she didnt reply, I did a Google search for her name. There was a short news article saying shed been found dead in her apartment a couple months after wed last spoken. It was ruled a suicide. When I found out, I was less devastated than I would have been if it were closer to that night. But Id sunk into a crippling depression since then. I was on autopilot; if I wasnt cutting, I was sleeping around. If I wasnt sleeping around, I was fantasizing about my own death. And there was one more thing. Something entirely different.

While I wasnt devastated about Bethanys death, I was still affected. That one more thing was the burgeoning prospect that my life could change for the better if I sought help. I didnt think I deserved it and I didnt think it could ever work. Still, I knew Id never have the courage to give myself the death I so desperately desired. So, on a whim, I checked myself into a hospital and said I was a threat to myself. It was funny, because as I said that, I realized it was the first time in as long as I could remember that I actually wasnt.

Its been 10 years since Bethany. My life is entirely different, thanks to medication and regular therapy. Im married and I have a young daughter whom I love more than anything. My scars have faded and my hope for death has been replaced with excitement for the future. And then, a couple weeks ago, I got the email about my Myspace account being hacked. 

Why am I writing all this? Because two days later I got an email from some Croatian domain Id never seen before. It was in broken English, but what it said was clear. It contained my full name, my current address, and the names of my wife and child. It also had the pictures of me and Bethany, along with snippets of the conversations wed had together. And at one point in those conversations, toward the very end of our relationship, Bethany specifically said we should go back to Sunflower Point to see what the worms have done to Henry. Whoever sent the email had a picture of Sunflower Point.

But why am I really writing all this? I dont expect sympathy. Why would anyone feel sympathy for me - a person who brutally killed a helpless man and has gotten away with it for so long? Because whoever sent that email has a demand if theyre going to stay quiet. And its not money. As payment for their silence, they want that sexy thing all the customers are dying to taste. Attached right below the demand is a picture of my 3 year-old daughter.

<TITLE> Bluefin </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-23 21:44:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It was getting harder and harder to get Pacific bluefin tuna. Yeah, I could get other varieties, but everyone knows Pacific bluefin is the best. Especially for sushi. I contacted supplier after supplier, and all of them told me the same thing: they were being pressured to phase out the product and the prices would continue to rise because the demand was higher than ever.

My customers are well off. They can afford the best, so they demand the best. If I cant give them what they demand, theyll go elsewhere. In this competitive restaurant environment, if that happens, Im done for. You can imagine my growing panic as the prices for bluefin rose and the supplies dwindled. Sure, my customers would pay whatever I charged when I could get it in, but that was becoming less and less frequent. The bigger restaurants would get first dibs. Why sell one to me when you can sell three or four to the guy down the street, especially when he had enough cash on hand to outbid me?

I was getting ready to give up hope. My sales were at an all-time low as the customers sought a better, more high-end selection from my competitors. In my desperation, I realized Id be willing to circumvent the law if it meant staying in business. Staying in business meant my girls could stay at Yale. It meant my wife could continue receiving top-quality nursing care in our home while her Alzheimers worsened. I wasnt ready to take that all away from them.

Ten years ago, I met a man named Satoshi. He was the nephew of one of my suppliers. Hed gone into business for himself and got into quite a bit of trouble for poaching some endangered sharks to sell their fins to the Chinese market. I think he spent a couple months in jail and had to pay a pretty big fine, but rumor had it that hed emerged a new man. He reformed his business and appeared to be extraordinarily successful. It was that extraordinary success which caused me to get in contact with him.

To me, it appeared Satoshi was too successful. His business was small compared to the other suppliers in the area, but he was living a life of luxury. He drove a Bentley when the other guys drove BMWs. He had three houses in the most expensive areas of the city when the other guys had one. That kind of thing. I had a feeling he was into something extra.

Within an hour of our meeting, Satoshi said he could get me Bluefin for 80% below market price. To say I was surprised was an understatement. In fact, I laughed in his face. He remained serious, though, and insisted he wasnt making it up. 

Apparently, there was an area off limits to fishermen where Bluefin congregated in massive numbers. They were attracted to the warm water or something. Satoshis connections were in the Japanese coast guard, and theyd been planning a pretty big scam where their patrol boats got rigged with fishing gear and they could haul up Bluefin at night and sell them off at dawn. All they needed was a buyer. 

80% below market price. I didnt ask any questions and just said yes. I was fairly sure the police would break in through the windows and arrest me as soon as I shook Satoshis hand, but they didnt. Satoshi just smiled at me as I wrote him a check. He told me I should expect the first delivery in the morning.

True to his word, at 5am, an unmarked truck pulled up in front of my restaurant. Two men got out, opened the back of the truck, and pulled three gorgeous bluefin from the icy compartment. Two were flash-frozen, one was ready for preparation. They brought them into the kitchen, helped me put two in the freezer, and left without saying a word.

I broke down the unfrozen one. It was perfect. The meat was firm and succulent. The samples I tasted were as good as the expensive stuff. I say good despite the fact Im not actually a huge fan of the fish. Go figure. But I could still tell when I was tasting the real deal, and this most certainly was the real deal. I went and drew a huge advertisement on our sidewalk chalkboard. I was going to sell the bluefin dishes for half what my competitors were asking for. Then I went into the kitchen, started to prepare the fish, and felt relieved for the first time in as long as I could remember.

Dinner service was the busiest in the history of my restaurant. Word spread on social media and the place was packed from open to close. People whod never been able to afford bluefin showed up once they learned how low the price was. The night was spectacular. So was the following night. And the night after.

I was delighted to take home many, many bluefin dishes to Aiko. Shed been having a rare, multi-day stretch of lucidity, and it warmed my heart to see her eating her favorite food and relishing her time spent with me. If I could feed her the food she loved most and could actually afford to do it, I was going to. I couldnt remember the last time Id seen her happy.

I received delivery after delivery from Satoshis guys and was making money hand over fist. I was tight-lipped about where I was getting my supply, and the competitors were scrambling to keep up. Aiko drifted in and out like those with Alzheimers do; but no matter how far gone she was on some nights, she always perked up when I served her the bluefin she adored. 

I started to grow a bit concerned, though, because it looked like Aiko had developed a skin condition. Shed bruise very easily and her skin was so delicate. Her nurse would have to be extremely careful when brushing her teeth because her gums would bleed badly. I was told it was a nutritional deficiency. Aiko was given some injections to help bring her levels back to normal.

The customers kept coming to the restaurant but Aiko got worse every day. Her nurse said if she didnt start to show signs of improvement soon, shed have to bring her to the hospital. When I stroked my wifes hair, I was dismayed to see that some came out in my hand.

On a busy Saturday night, the nurse called me in a panic. Aiko had developed terrible, bloody diarrhea and was vomiting blood. Shed been rushed to the hospital and was in intensive care. I told the restaurant manager to take over and I sped to the hospital as quickly as possible.

Aiko was in a room by herself. She was stuffed with tubes and plugged with wires. Monitors displayed countless readouts that meant nothing to me. I stared at her from behind the glass and told the doctors I needed to go in and sit with her. They refused. I protested and fought, but I couldnt get through the door. It was locked. Behind the glass, a torrent of blood erupted from Aikos mouth. It filled the tube and poured out over the sides of her face. A door on the other side of the room opened and doctors wearing yellow suits and masks ran in. They closed the curtains and I was left with Aikos nurse. We cried together.

My cell phone rang. Satoshi. I dont know why I answered, but I did. He was beside himself with what sounded like terror. I barely could make out what he was saying, but in his panicky outbursts, I realized he was telling me something was wrong with the fish hed been selling me.

I demanded that he calm down and speak clearly. What about the fish, Satoshi?

You have to stop using it, he choked out, panic still tainting his voice.

Why?, I asked, as pinpricks of dread rose along my back and neck. All I heard on his end was weeping. Satoshi!, I yelled, causing the nurse to jump.

His voice trembled. I didnt know they were getting it from there.

Oh no, I breathed. I closed my eyes. Satoshi...where are they getting the bluefin?

An eternity passed as I listened to the man sob weakly into the phone.

I screamed his name with such violence I felt something in my throat tear.

In a tiny, almost childlike tone, Satoshi answered me.

Fukushima Bay.

The best part of starving to death is the knowledge that, right before I die, the person I see in the mirror will be the most beautiful person I can possibly be. No extraneous fat; no extraneous skin; no extraneous me. Just a pure distillation of my soul before its freed from the body that imprisons it. Its what I look forward to more than anything in the world. But I cant celebrate yet. Theres still too much of me. I have a lot of work to do.

Elaine was my ana buddy. We both knew I was better at it than she was. She told me how much I inspired her, and I believed it. It felt good to help my friend. Thats how it had been for the last couple years. When she started ranting and raving about this amazing girl Aida she met online whos the most inspirational person shed ever met, though, I felt a twinge of betrayal. Who was this girl and what was she telling my friend?

Elaine said Aida was a new member on our pro-ana message board. She likes to hang around in the Every Step Makes You Smaller fitness section. A runner, apparently. Id never needed to visit that section of the site, so I never noticed her. When Elaine started running, I only found out a week later when she arrived at my place unannounced. I was surprised. I live 30 miles from her. She didnt have a car and would refuse to take public transportation for some reason, so when she told me she ran, I believed her. Plus she was covered in sweat and panting like she was about to keel over.

You have to realize something: Im better than Elaine. Im lighter and more dedicated. I run on my treadmill three times a day until I make sure I burn every single calorie Ive eaten, plus another hundred. But never 30 miles. And Elaine was huge compared to me. Over 100lbs. Shed just burned 2300 calories in one run. Thats more than I eat in four or five days. She couldnt tell how jealous and angry I was through her exhaustion, which was good, because I needed to find out how she managed to do that.

This was the point Elaine mentioned Aida. She said Aida not only gave her amazing advice about how to run, but told her how to make a supplement that gave her so much energy and made each step feel like an amazing accomplishment. Like I said, I didnt know who Aida was, but when I heard this, I hated her. I hate shortcuts. I dont take supplements. Every pound Ive lost was through sheer determination and willpower. Shortcuts make you soft. Im not soft. Im not.

I am soft. If Im going to be honest, Ill admit to one shortcut. Mia. There are days I cant control myself and Ill eat a whole bag of gummi bears or two yogurts. Both fat free, but still too much. I could feel the space between my ribs filling in like canyons during a flash flood. Theres no worse feeling in the world than becoming more when all you dream about is being less. 

My index and middle fingers would manipulate the dime-sized, scarred spot on the back of my throat. It took so, so long. Id have to push hard and claw at the spot with my fingernails for ten straight minutes. It felt like I was reaching in and pulling the food up and out of me. Elaine was the only one who knew about it. Shed been doing that long enough to notice my Russells sign and even though she hadnt said anything to me or asked for tips, I was fairly certain she took some comfort in the fact she wasnt alone with mia. 

Thats something I hated about her. I bet it sounds like I was a bad friend, doesnt it? But I cant help it. Elaine thought she was like me when she wasnt. Im pure. My successes are through restriction. Through the abnegation of pleasure. Im an ascetic. Strong. Pure. Holy. 

Elaine Elaine was a disaster. She was corporeal and weak; she couldnt control her urges. After she stuffed herself, if her fingers werent down her throat trying to tickle the food out of her belly, a handful of laxatives were splashing in so she can shit everything out. Her teeth were brown and her cheeks were swollen with fluids. She thought we were the same. I am better.

And then she ran to my house. 30 miles. When the doorbell rang, I was washing multicolored jellybean vomit from my hand and wrist and forearm. 30 miles. Id scratched the surface off my scar so the back of my throat was bleeding and the cut was coated with stinging stomach acid. 30 miles and 2300 calories. I hadnt shit in 13 days and my disgusting, fat belly was distended like I was pregnant even though itd been two years since my last period. 30 miles, 2300 calories, and more excited than exhausted.

Elaine was winning. I had to let her tell me all about Aida and the supplements.

Aida was very private and didnt post progress pics. To me, I assumed that meant she was fat. That alone made me skeptical of any advice shed have to give. But 30 miles. Elaine and I browsed through Aidas post history and I learned a few things like how to run to minimize impact so you could run farther without injury. More running meant more calories burned. I made a mental note to incorporate that change into my running style. I also learned about sugar. Id been puking up all the extra sugar Id eat, but Aida said to run it off. If I made the changes to my running style and ran off the extra sugar rather than throwing it up, Id burn off what Id eaten, plus extra that would have just stayed as fat if Id thrown it up instead.

There were a few other, small tweaks. But the supplement was what I wanted to hear about. The shortcut. And I hated myself for it. But 30 miles. The supplement was pretty simple. It was a certain kind of mushroom mixed with caffeine powder and ephedra. Aida provided a link where we could get the chemicals online. Wed have to find the mushroom for ourselves. Elaine, however, already had all the stuff.

Elaine was beaming with pride and self-satisfaction. I knew she was delighted to finally be the one to provide inspiration. Shed followed me for so long. But now she was in the lead. Even though she was 100lbs to my 85, she was winning. Even though her cheeks were bouncy and fat while mine were streamlined and gaunt, she was winning. I asked if we could go back to her place so I could try the supplement. She grinned and said yes. We got into my car and headed over.

Elaines apartment was a disaster; food containers everywhere, photos of models and singers stapled to the walls, dishes piled on the counter next to the full sink, and the unmistakable, cloying scent of old vomit. I didnt care. My focus was on the supplement. I sat on her couch and waited while she went in the kitchen.

She emerged with two spoons perched on a plate. Inside each spoon was a paste of the mixture Aida had taught Elaine how to make. Mushrooms, caffeine, and ephedra. I asked her if she was going to run with me. She nodded. I didnt know how to feel about that. Elaine was going to do more than 30 miles and I had no idea how far Id go. I hoped Id be able to outrun her.

We swallowed the awful-tasting concoction and Elaine let me borrow some running clothes. They were extremely baggy. It wasnt long before I felt the effect of the supplement. It was not altogether unpleasant, but it was speedy. Like Id had too much coffee.

One she felt it kick in, we headed out. We ran at a brisk pace, keeping up with one another and not talking as we went. The effect of the supplement grew stronger. The speedy feeling remained, but another started to come in alongside it: satisfaction. Every step felt like it was making a huge, positive difference in my life. It reinforced my drive to take more and more steps. The sensation was wonderful.

My knee, which had been bothering me for the last few months, was perfectly fine after Id adjusted my stride to fit Aidas recommendation. Elaine chugged along next to me, staring straight ahead, with a trace of a smile on her lips.

Wed planned to run all the way back to my place. I figured if we couldnt make it, Id take the subway or a bus to Elaines to get my car and then Id pick her up. But I could tell, after the first three or four miles, we wouldnt be needing a car. 

Our feet slapped against the pavement and we picked up speed as we went. It was a powerful stride just like Id been capable of back when I ran track in high school. Before I realized I had to get smaller. Before I realized how much space I took up. But now, as the wind whistled by my ears, I knew this was how it would all end for me. This was the key to the success that had eluded me as I hovered pathetically between 83 and 86 pounds. 

I was all energy. I could feel my flesh clinging to my ribs and hips and collarbones and drawing ever inward; each protrusive bone an indication of my hard work and dedication. I was lost in my head for countless miles. I imagined running forever as my skin melted away and left a trail of useless waste behind me. Id be a perfect girl if I ran far enough - a creature of bone and momentum. Perfect, perfect me. And once I couldnt run anymore - once my body had given everything it had and Id traversed the world and shown every living person the power of my will - the last fragments of bone would splinter away and my soul would finally rise. I would be free.

A hand on my arm brought me back into reality. Elaine had grabbed me. We were in front of my apartment. I looked down at myself. My body was still there. Hatred and disappointment danced in a peristaltic wave through the sweating meat that trapped me. I plodded up the steps, took my key from around my neck, and we went inside.

Elaine stayed with me that night. As the days went by, we would run a lot together. When our feet ached and our shins felt as if theyd crumble from the relentless pressure of our motion, wed consult Aida, who was always there. Always online, as if shed been waiting for us.

Over time, the word got out to other ana girls in our city who used the forum. Sometimes there would be six or seven of us running together, all clattering bones and grim determination. All rushing toward our goal of zero. 

When Elaine and I werent collecting our disability checks, we were running. Every day, we would meet up and run together. My disdain for her began to evaporate as I watched her working as hard as I was. We inspired one another to go farther and farther, harder and harder. I was 74lbs. Elaine was still 100. The knuckles on her right hand were always freshly scabbed.

Today, the morning my scale hit 70 for the first time since I was 11 years old, I drove to Elaines. She didnt answer the door when I knocked. When I called her cell phone, she didnt answer. I let myself in using the key she kept hidden. I found what Id long anticipated.

Elaines gray face was hanging onto the toilet by her chin. The rest of her was curled in a loose ball. Vomit and dark blood covered the toilet and the floor around her. Textbook gastric rupture.

I felt very little while I looked at her corpse. She wasnt wearing clothes, and I found myself inspecting the curvature of her ribs and hips and comparing them to my own. Mine were more angular and obvious. Shed lost.

I headed over to Elaines computer. The pro-ana forum was onscreen. I clicked over to Every Step Makes You Smaller and found Aida there messaging with some young teens about how to run really far without their parents getting worried. When I interjected the news of Elaines death into the chat thread, the subject predictably changed to her. The teens made a big show of it, the older users said theyd pray or send positive vibes; all the obvious stuff.

Aida, though, sent me a private message. All it said was, dont call the police yet - watch what happens. So I did.

I went for a run. 45 miles. When I came back a few hours later, Elaine was different. Her skin was deeply porous and thin, wiry stalks pushed themselves from the center of each hole. Stringy, white stuff was growing out of her mouth and butt in thick clumps; one clump dangling in the bloody toilet water, the other pushing out across the floor.

I messaged Aida. The reply was instantaneous. Cut off the stalks and eat them. Dont worry, there are no real cals. Then you can go for a run. I promise, by the time youre done, youll be the person you want to be.

The last sentence was the most beautiful thing Id ever read. I cut the clumps, which I discovered were mushrooms, out of Elaine. I washed them, sliced them up, and ate them. I did my best to believe Aida that they didnt have calories.

Now Im going to do the next part. I wrote to the people on the forum and told them what I was going to do. They told me good luck and be safe; the default reply of the jealous people there who havent reached the point they dream about. Id given that reply before many times. All the while, though, I knew Id get there eventually. And now Im here.

I feel more energy than Ive ever felt in my life. My skin is different; its sticky and delicate. Its almost like it wants to come off. And thats what Ive worked so hard for. A girl of bones who runs away from the skin that traps her. By the time you read this - by the time Ive gone the hundreds or maybe even thousands of miles I know Ill be able to go - Ill be who Ive always wanted to be: no one at all. Perfect, weightless zero.

Thank you, Aida.

<TEXT> I was seven the first time Grandpa invited me into the basement to see his safe. It was massive. Apparently, the original owners told him the house had to be built around it; there was no way it couldve been brought in afterward. When I asked him what was inside, he just smiled and said, maybe Ill tell you when youre older. I remember being frightened by that smile. Everything about my grandfather frightened me, to be honest. I was never able to put a finger on why, but the feeling was real. I dreaded whenever Mom said we were going to visit.

Every time Mom and I were there, his housekeepers would wait on us hand and foot. Even at an early age, I noticed how they seemed intimidated by my grandfather and were quiet, timid, and unwilling to speak unless they were spoken to. It was almost like theyd been traumatized. 

When I was 13, I learned an unsettling fact about the housekeepers: they were, in fact, his wives. The grandmother Id known, who died when I was very young, was merely one of nine. Mom didnt want to explain the whole thing to me. I could tell she was afraid of him, too. When I asked why shed chosen to keep in touch with him after Dad died, she told me I needed a male figure in my life. It sounded strange to me, but I never pressed the issue.

On the day before my 16th birthday, Mom said Grandpa wanted to take me hunting. I absolutely hated the idea. Being alone with my grandfather on his sprawling property which comprised countless acres of deep, dark woods was one thing, but the addition of guns to that already-unpalatable scenario basically made it the last thing Id ever want to do. I protested and argued and whined. Mom wouldnt have any of it. Hes done a lot for you over the years, she insisted. Youll go and youll be polite.

And that was that.

Mom woke me up before dawn on my birthday and drove me the two hours it took to reach Grandpas home. She didnt get out of the car. I knocked on the door and one of his wives, Gert, ushered me into the kitchen where there was a hearty breakfast waiting for me. Despite not being even remotely hungry, I gnawed on some bacon and shoveled some eggs into my mouth. I didnt want Grandpa to get angry at Gert for making food I didnt want to eat.

As I was finishing up, my grandfather came down the stairs. Despite being in his 70s, he was strong and enormous. His 66 frame dwarfed me; at over 300lbs, he was more than twice my weight, too. As usual, he grinned and exposed teeth that were too straight and too perfect for a man his age. I tried and failed to prevent gooseflesh from rising along my spine.

He greeted me with a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, his deep voice resonating throughout the cavernous kitchen. I smiled at him and did my best to make it look like I was deeply appreciative. He asked if I was finished eating. I nodded. After instructing Gert to clean the place up, he put his massive right hand on my shoulder and told me to follow him.

I trudged along as he walked across the house to the basement door. He flipped the lightswitch and we walked down the thick, wooden stairs. He turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs and I immediately knew what he was going to show me. We stopped in front of the colossal, iron safe.

I think youre ready to see what Ive got in here, Grandpa informed me.

Excitement and fear churned in my breakfast-stuffed stomach. Id wondered what was in that safe for as long as I could remember. Now that I was about to find out, I was borderline terrified. What did he have in there that had needed to stay secret? Id learned he was a polygamist, and probably an abusive one, but he and my mother acted like it was a normal fact of life. What was so bad that he had to keep actively hidden from the world inside a safe the size of a small car?

Grandpa turned the old, chrome-plated combination lock a few times. I heard something unlatch from deep inside the iron bowels of the thing. With a grunt of effort, my grandfather pulled open the heavy door.

I let out the breath Id been unconsciously holding in one, long sigh. Inside was an arsenal of firearms. Rifles, shotguns, pistols, and countless boxes of ammunition.

John, he said, staring intently at my face, some of these guns arent legal anymore. Im showing them to you because youre family, I trust you, and these will be yours someday. I dont want you to tell anyone about whats in here because I could get in a lot of trouble.

I nodded my understanding and promised him I wouldnt say anything to anyone.

Good!, he exclaimed. Now pick one for yourself. Were going hunting.

I didnt know anything about guns. I thought back to the television shows Id watched and tried to remember what hunters used in them. I selected a long rifle-looking thing.

M1 Garand, Grandpa announced. Excellent!

He pulled the gun from the safe, loaded it with ammunition, and handed it to me. 

Keep it pointed at the ground and dont touch the trigger until youre ready to shoot something, he warned. He pulled another, similar-looking rifle from the safe, loaded it for himself, and picked out a small revolver, which he loaded and stuffed into his front pocket.

Come on, he boomed cheerily, lets go for a walk.

The morning was cold and the sun had barely started to rise. It was overcast and every so often, a flake or two of snow would float to the ground in front of my face. I stared at the ground while my grandfather walked ahead of me.

We walked at a brisk pace for what felt like an hour. The sun rose behind an overcast curtain and its light barely penetrated the dense, coniferous canopy above us. The longer we walked, the more unnerved I became. It seemed like the day was getting darker, not brighter, as the density of the forest swallowed nearly everything the shrouded sky could produce. I noticed animals as we walked, but they were all ignored by Grandpa. I wondered what it was we were hunting.

We passed deer, squirrels, rabbits, and raccoons. Eventually, growing tired of walking in silence and becoming increasingly aware wed have to walk the whole way back, too, I spoke up and asked where we were going and what we were hunting.

Without turning around, Grandpa replied. Ill be honest with you, John; were not hunting anything. Bears like to roam around these woods and Ive seen a lot of them over the years. They never bothered me, but I want us to be prepared in case todays any different.

I just said, okay, but I wondered why the hell we were out here in the first place if we werent actually going hunting. I didnt want to say it just like that to my grandfather, though, so I just asked, are we near where were going?

Grandpa stopped walking and turned around. That same, unnerving smile was plastered across his lined face. Just on the other side of that rock formation, he said, pointing. Come on.

Instead of going ahead, Grandpa slowed down and walked next to me. 

Youre a man now, John. Your father should be the one walking with you, not me. The good Lord saw it fit to take him when you were a baby, though, and I knew I had to step up and show you what that means.

We stopped at the rock formation. Well have to climb over.

Grandpa climbed next to me. It wasnt steep and the footing was solid. We moved easily. He kept talking.

Your mom told me a few years ago that you knew my housekeepers were actually my wives. And thats okay. I worried you might be confused, but you always surprised me by your maturity. Thats whats important to me. Not age.

We reached the top of the rock formation. I looked down at the forest below and started to climb down with him.

Its your job as a man to claim as many women as you want.

I thought about protesting, but I didnt dare interrupt. I let him continue.

Theyre yours. Its their duty to be there for you, to bear your children, and to take care of your needs, whatever they may be.

We climbed down in silence for a few minutes, as if he wanted to make sure I had time to reflect on the importance of what hed just said. A little while later, we reached the forest floor.

When your Dad died, he started, his voice breaking with emotion that he quickly swallowed, I was put in a difficult position. He was my son, and my son embraced the tradition of all the men in our family; me, my father, his father, his father, and so on.

The trees seemed much taller than before. The forest on the other side of the rock formation was older than what wed been walking through, and even darker. I had to squint to see, even though, when I snuck a look at my phone, it was almost 10am. 

You have a unique family tree, John. Remember, your father respected the tradition of the family. That means your mother was not his only wife.

This news made my head spin. I didnt remember much about Dad, but I always thought he was a decent, caring person. Hearing he was anything like my grandfather was a terrible revelation.

Like I said, I was put in a difficult situation. Your father had 12 wives. For whatever reason, despite him impregnating all of them, only one gave birth to a boy. Your mother.

I felt mildly dizzy. You mean I have sisters? I asked, hating that my voice cracked an octave higher on the last syllable of the sentence.

12 of them. One of your fathers wives had twin girls.

Can I meet them? My voice was back to its normal pitch. I sounded calm and oddly hopeful, despite the intense discomfort I felt.

A womans duty is to serve the men in her life, John. Your mom had you, and it became her duty to serve you. When your father died, the other wives couldnt serve anyone. They no longer had any purpose. Its not like the daughters could have carried the family name.

I understand, I said, not understanding. So Ill never get to meet them?

John. They lost their only purpose in life. The daughters couldnt carry the family name. What purpose could they have had?

I stared into Grandpas eyes. Their intense blue was startlingly bright against the gloom of the forest. As wed stood and talked, the clouds had given way to partial sunshine. It was still dark, but I could see more than 10 feet in front of me.

I asked you a question, John. What purpose could they have had?

I shifted in place with acute awareness of how uneasy and timid I must have looked to the giant man in front of me. It was obvious I needed to tell him what he needed to hear.

They didnt have any purpose at all, Grandpa. The words felt disgusting as they came out of my mouth.

The smile returned to his face. Good boy, John. He paused before he spoke again. Good boy.

We stared out at the endless forest ahead of us. I got ready to ask if we could start heading back before Grandpa spoke again.

I had to make things right after your father died. He pointed up, over his head. No waste.

I started to shake as a feeling of dread suffused throughout my body. Grandpa kept his hand raised with his finger pointing up. Despite not wanting to look, I craned my neck and stared into the shadowy canopy. It didnt take long before I realized what he was pointing at. I gasped with such force I began to choke.

Skeletal bodies in ragged clothing hung from the branches above. Some were big, some were small. Some were tiny. All were dead. Long, long dead.

Meet your stepmothers and your stepsisters, John. I know you dont remember them, but they all loved you and your father very much.

Tears streamed down my face as rage began to replace my fear. Did you -

I did, he declared. There was pride in his voice.

He watched as I raised my rifle and pointed it at his barrel chest. You dont need to, John. Ill take care of it so you dont have to. He produced the pistol from his jacket pocket and held it against his temple.

Ive done my part, John. I know you wont actually shoot me, but youll report what happened here and Ill be arrested. Im going to make it easy for you and take care of the ugly part myself.

He tightened his grip on the pistol. Let what I told you sink in, John. Talk to your mother about it. She knows all about this. Shell help you. Its her job to help you. Youll see it my way when youre a little older.

A breeze whistled through the trees. Above us, I heard the ragged dresses on the bodies rippling in the wind. My mind wandered to the poor women back at grandpas house; women whod been abused for decades by a man who thought they were nothing but property. The thought of how theyd been so conditioned over that time to buy into the hideous tradition of the awful man in their lives prompted a terrifying realization.

Your...your wives, I choked out. What will happen to them?

That repulsive smile gashed my grandfather face as he spoke. They knew why we were coming out here, John. And they knew only you were coming back. Im sure they did what they needed to while weve been away.

A sob burst from my lips as I thought about Gerts sad smile while she watched me eat the birthday breakfast shed made for me. 

The clicking of the guns hammer being cocked caused me to look back up at my grandfather. He stared into my eyes with an intensity Id only seen from animals about to maul their prey.

Happy Birthday, John. Dont ever forget the day you became a man. And dont forget what it means to be one. Tradition over all, John. Tradition over all.

He took the gun from the side of his head and placed it in his mouth. He squeezed the trigger and dropped heavily to the soft blanket of pine needles on the forest floor. Blood gushed from his mouth and nose. 

I stood, motionless, watching the blood drain out of his head. Sounds of the forest gradually replaced the ringing in my ears. Birds chirped. Squirrels chittered. Branches clattered. Dresses fluttered.

<TEXT> Ryan, a handsome boy in red, felt his arm growing tired. His two sisters, Madison in white and Regina in sky blue, looked around for things that might be able to help.

While their loving dad kept watch, Madison trawled for seaweed. She noticed Ryan was uncomfortable and tried to rush. Luckily for her brother, the pressure pushing against his arm had diminished and he was able to straighten up. Hurry up!, he yelled to Madison and Regina. He was the most impatient one in the family. 

Dont yell at your sisters, scolded Dad. Still, he gently encouraged them to move faster. 

Time is a factor, kids, he informed them.

Madison brought the seaweed over to Ryan while Regina was arriving with a few heavy rocks. Regina set them down in front of where her brother was standing. She went back a few times and carried over more. Madison crouched, her butt in the water, and focused on slipping the seaweed underneath and around the rocks.

Dad stood, hands on his hips, and called out, How does it look, kids?

I think were done!, shouted Madison.

Dad looked back up the beach and all around. Then he strode out to where his kids had been working.

You all did SUCH a great job! He grabbed them in a bear hug and they stood, watching as the tide come in over the area where theyd done such good work.

They walked together about a hundred feet down the beach and stood on the shore.

Now remember kids, mom will be back in a few minutes. What do we do when we see her coming?

Regina piped up. We pretend cry and look around in the water!

Thats right! How about you, Ryan, what are you going to say?

Ryan stood proudly with his hands on his hips. I say that Jason fell out of my hug into the ocean when a wave came and we cant find him.

Atta boy!, Dad crowed. He turned to Madison. Maddie, are you excited to have your bedroom all to yourself again? No more crib and no more crying?

Madison smiled shyly at her tall, strong father. Yes Daddy, she said.

Good!, Dad exclaimed, grinning. And now your mom and I can have more money to buy you guys presents for being such great kids. He glanced over to his left. And I think that person walking waaaaay down the beach is Mom. You all ready?

Yeah!, the kids yelled in unison.

Go for it!, encouraged Dad, blinking away the tears of pride that had started to well up in his eyes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [*Tumblr.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4nh4od/something_horrible_is_happening_to_me_on_tumblr/) [*Reddit.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4nvybw/something_horrible_is_happening_to_me_on_reddit/) [*Facebook.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4o23lg/something_horrible_is_happening_to_me_on_facebook/)

So. Many. Penises. Since Eugene left me, I must have looked at a thousand of them. Cut, uncut, black, mocha, tan, pink, beige, thick, thin, long, hairy, shaved, trimmed, veiny, smooth, micro, macro, and even the elusive gargantuan. Ill be honest with you, though: its not even like I was open to the idea of a hookup at that point. It was still too soon. The emotions were too raw. That said, I wasn't going to be ashamed of myself for looking at pictures of dicks to help pass the time. I like dicks. 

After a few weeks of browsing, I started involving myself in actual chats. You know, more than the basic you show me yours and Ill show you mine type of stuff Id been doing. Most guys didnt really want to talk about much; they were more interested in meeting up and banging. I wasnt ready for that, though. I was polite enough with my rejections, and most of them were cool with it. Not all, but most.

One afternoon last month, a guy named Dion sent me a message. I almost fainted. He was gorgeous. It looked like hed been carved from onyx and sculpted by Michelangelo himself. We chatted for a while. Pretty easily, too. Not once did he hint at a hookup, and rather than advertising himself with below-the-waist pictures, the most risque photo he sent to me was him standing shirtless in his sweatpants.  

He told me hed just gone through a breakup, too, and wanted to take things slowly. It was music to my ears. Well, eyes, since wed only been chatting via text at that point. But those text chats turned into multi-hour chat sessions. After a couple days, I gave him my number. We talked on the phone more than Id ever talked to anyone. Even Eugene, and were together for seven years. Something about Dion just seemed right. I got the impression he felt the same way about me, too.

As it turned out, Dion worked for a company that advertised on Grindr. He asked if Id seen their stuff, and then he described what the ads looked like. As soon as he mentioned one particular feature, I definitely know what he was talking about. It was an awful ad. It took up the whole screen and flashed colors in a way I found somewhat unsettling. To make it worse, it was almost impossible to hit the close button at the top, which I was fairly certain moved around slightly to prevent it the ad from being turned off.

He laughed a little and apologized for that part. He said the programmers might have been a little overzealous. The customer wanted it that way, though, and since Grindr hadnt explicitly disallowed that type of thing yet, they were going to use it and reap the benefits of the ad being displayed for those extra few seconds. 

When I asked Dion what the company sold, since the ad really didnt give me much of an idea, he was tight-lipped. He couldnt talk about that stuff, apparently. I was okay with that. We hadnt even met in person, yet. I didnt expect him to disclose any top-secret information to someone who was still essentially a stranger. 

Our conversations continued to go well and we were ready to take the next step. On Tuesday, we decided to meet. His office wasnt far from my apartment. We met at a nearby park. I knew he was tall, but my first impression I got when we met was that he was a giant. Im 511, but Dion had to have been 68. Funny, wed never even talked about height. He gave me the biggest, warmest hug when we finally stood together. I pecked his cheek a little more shyly than Id intended, and we headed to the restaurant wed both heard was great but never visited.

Dinner was spectacular and the company was even better. Our chemistry was obvious and intoxicating. We laughed and flirted and had a truly wonderful time with one another. Afterward, he walked me home. We made out in front of my apartment building for a minute or two, but we both agreed we should wait for at least the second date before getting too physical. But we promised one another there would definitely be a second date. He asked if it could be tomorrow. I winked at him and I told him Id call in the morning.

Once I got back into my apartment, my sexual frustration had reached a Krakatoan peak. And what do I do when Im sexually frustrated? I look at dicks. So I looked at dicks. I started off on Grindr, but after a while I started feeling a little guilty. Sure, it was just innocent fun and flirting with strangers, but even though Dion and I werent exclusive or even in an actual relationship at all, it didnt feel right. Besides, right when Id decided to move on to porn, those damn ads on Grindr kept showing up and distracted the hell out of me. The flashing lights and awful close buttons had me feeling pissed off at Dion for even being tangentially involved with them. Anger wasnt something I wanted to feel when I was in the mood to jerk off and go to sleep.

After Id closed the program, those awful, blinking ads stuck with me. It was like when you look into the sun for too long and have the image burned into your retinas. But my sex drive overshadowed any temporary vision problems. To PornHub I went. Their gay section had gotten SO much better over the last couple years. I browsed for a while until I found a clip Id loved a day or so ago. I clicked it and fast forwarded to the action, but I felt growing nausea as it all went on. I started to worry Id gotten food poisoning. To make matters worse, it wasnt the exact clip from the other day after all. The beginning part was the same, but right toward the end, instead of the originally delicious money shot scene, someone had spliced in some awful, gory nonsense that totally took me out of the mood. 

I went to bed, but my stomach still hurt and I had nightmares about stuff I cant remember. Yesterday, I called Dion like Id promised. I told him I wasnt feeling too well, and I asked him if he felt off after dinner too. He said he felt fine, and then asked if we should cancel our plan for him to come over later in the day. Not wanting to be a disappointment, I said no way. Besides, I really did want to see him.

An hour or so before he got there, I decided to watch some porn again. My stomach was feeling a bit better and I figured if Dion and I might get physical for the first time, Id want the performance to last a little longer than the 19 seconds I figured it would with someone as attractive as him. Back to PornHub I went.

Again, nausea. To make matters worse, whoever had screwed with the clip Id enjoyed so much was doing the same thing to other videos. Right when the action was at its peak, thered be a scene of something completely terrible. A dead baby. Someone getting raped. A guy with his lower jaw blown off. A woman with her face melted from acid. Im pretty open to basic kinks, but that stuff was above and beyond anything I wanted to see. It was straight-up horror and snuff. My sex drive dried up and I was left dealing with my floppy dick and a hell of a stomach ache. The perfect way to start a potentially-hot date.

Dion arrived around suppertime. Id gathered my senses in the meantime and had prepared some baked salmon, quinoa salad, and a cheese board. He was absolutely awestruck by the food. I guess he wasnt much of a chef and none of his other dates had cooked something so nice for him. That felt good to hear. 

He devoured the food with enthusiasm and I did my best to match his voraciousness, but my stomach was really bothering me. I tried to hide it, though, and I dont think he noticed. The rest of the night progressed like Id hoped. After dinner and wine and some fancy hipster ice cream Dion had brought, we were both feeling good. Well, horny. I didnt feel good. The wine wed consumed helped take the edge off my stomach pain, but while we were making out on the couch, I was feeling worse and worse. My sex drive was in charge, though, and I powered through the nausea and before too long, we were down to our underwear and getting ready to have some real fun.

I was thankful my nausea hadnt diminished my physical ability to get aroused. I was sporting quite a rager that Dion seemed quite interested in. Still, he refused to touch me. He preferred to tease with kisses on my lips, neck, and cheeks. Meanwhile, I was pawing at him and practically tearing off his underwear. He resisted, though. Dion got up and stood in front of me. He looked like a Greek god. Then slowly - maddeningly slowly - he inched his underwear down.

My vision started to blur as his anatomy came into view. My nausea overpowered me in a pulsating wave. Dion stood naked only two feet away, but around him emerged a scenario of abject horror and depravity. Screaming children clutched the remains of their dismembered mothers torsos as faceless, horribly-misshapen men poked and prodded at them with their bulbous, skinless erections. Other bodies were hanged by their own bowels in the ghosts of trees and posts; the contents of their entrails drizzling down onto the dead and the rapists below. 

I opened my mouth, unsure if I was going to scream or vomit. Instead, I just mouthed the word help to Dion, and as my consciousness waned from the panic I felt, I saw Dion smiling at me, his genitals replaced by a glistening caldera of gore. It was the last thing I saw before I passed out.

I dont know how long I was out. When I woke up, I found Id collapsed to the floor with my face resting in a puddle of salmon and quinoa vomit. The scene of impossible violence was gone. Dion was dressed and standing near the door, talking on his cell phone.

*Im sorry to bother you so late, Reverend. Yes, this is Dion. I just wanted to let you know Ive had remarkable success with our first test subject. Yes, thats right. I believe hes been entirely reprogrammed. Yes sir, thats correct. Zero ability to act on his desires.*

I listened without moving as horror and dread came rushing back.

*Thank you, sir. Ill direct the company to proceed with more ad buys in all metropolitan markets. Thank you, I realize how important this success is. God bless you too, Reverend.*

Dion opened the door and walked out. I used the couch to pull myself to my feet. I called the police and demanded to speak with a detective, but when I finally got one on the phone, I could swear I heard him laughing to himself when he said hed check it out. I havent heard from anyone since. This all happened last night. Now, on message boards all over, Im seeing people complaining about the flashing, hard-to-close ads that are showing up on Grindr. Those same people are complaining about how theyre not feeling well after having to see them. 

Whoever reads this, please help. I dont know what to do.

I dont know shit about Facebook. I started an account late last year to promote my website. Not much happened. I plugged my Facebook address pretty much everywhere I went, and while fans trickled in and one or two even shared some of the content I posted, my page wasnt growing nearly as quickly as Id hoped.

Fast forward a couple months. Same problem. In total, I think my page was stuck around 100 likes. The majority of those were from the first week I started the page and a bunch of nice Reddit users felt sympathy for me and visited, clicked like, and never came again. I cant blame them, to be honest.

I was in a creative rut. Very little new content was coming out, and whatever did reach completion was nothing but a rehashing of older, more popular stories Id done in the past. I was hoping to piggyback on their successes. It didnt work. It was obvious that interest was waning. 

All this was coming at a bad time. My Tumblr, which had done spectacularly well for the first four months of its existence, was also stagnating. Followers were disappearing. Again, I cant blame them. Why follow a blog that just reposts old stories without putting anything out thats new or interesting? Id reached a point where I was starting to think writing wasnt for me and Id have to rethink everything Id envisioned for my future.

Out of nowhere, sometime in April, I got a notification on Facebook that my page had been mentioned. I clicked through, and was astonished to find out that a page with nearly 10 million fans had posted one of my older stories and had credited my own Facebook page as the content creator. Messages and likes came in droves. Friend requests, too. 

I didnt know what to do with all the newfound interest in my work. My creativity hadnt been piqued by it all, but my enthusiasm had reemerged. I chatted with people who messaged me, I gave advice to aspiring writers, despite not really believing any of what I was saying, and I even agreed to collaborate with another, semi-well known author on a piece at some point in the fall.

As April progressed, more and more people were visiting my page and inhaling my old content. Each day, Id spend hours replying to notifications and messages; sometimes holding 10 real-time conversations at once. It felt good to be connecting with people again. Its something I hadnt really done at all since high school, and that was almost 20 years ago.

I grew close with a few of the people whod been messaging me. People from all over the world, in fact. We chatted about nothing and everything, to use a cliche that I despise but find impossible to avoid. The more we talked, the closer we got. There were about 25 people out of the hundreds who I really felt a connection with. I think it was mutual, too. We chatted together on Facebook, and then we started doing group emails.

In May, Charles, one of the 25, suggested a meetup. Obviously for some of them, it was impossible. Quite a few were way too far away for that to be possible for them, but 8 or 9 of us were all within around 300 miles of one another. After working through some logistical issues, we made it happen. Seven people showed up. I got to meet seven, wonderful people: Charles, Lynn, Malcolm, Anita, Bev, Mellie, and Raj. 

We met up at a small restaurant in the Tribeca area of NYC. We chatted and laughed and had an all-around fantastic time. I enjoyed myself and my new friends more than I can even express. But it was Bev who really stood out. 

Wed grown close online, but I never had any hope of getting much closer than that. It all changed when we met. While we all shared stories and jokes and beers around the table, Bev and I held hands. She squeezed my fingers with her own and I stroked her wrist and toyed with her bracelet. During the brief glances we shared with one another, we both knew something special was happening. 

When it was obvious the night was coming to an end and everyone headed back to their respective hotel rooms or homes, Bev and I remained together. We headed back to her hotel room and let things take their natural course. It was truly wonderful.

After it was all over, Bev got up from the bed to take a shower. I propped myself up with my laptop on my lap, happily reminiscing about the time not only she and I had spent together, but the time all eight of us had shared hours earlier. I decided to go on Facebook and leave individual messages for my new friends to show how much I appreciated them.

While clicking through to where I needed to go, I realized Id never even visited their pages before. Wed all just chatted either on my page or through email. I clicked on Malcolms first. It was weird. A lot of his friends had posted some pretty depressing emo stuff on his wall. I wrote my little thank you paragraph, and then headed over to Charles page.

Same thing. Just sad stuff. I wrote my letter and moved on. Lynn, Raj, and Mellies were the same. A strange feeling started inside my chest and gradually bloomed outward while gooseflesh prickled my limbs. 

I clicked on Anitas wall. More depressing messages. One in particular caught my eye: Well always you love, Anita. You will always be our beautiful, sweet daughter. It was from her parents. Dated 2011.

The feeling of discomfort and dread intensified. I went back to all the other pages Id just been to and scrolled down. All the depressing messages were from between 2009 and 2016. They all had something in common: they were saying some variant of goodbye.

Doing my best to control my breathing, I navigated to the one page I hadnt visited yet. Bevs. The message on her wall, dated February 2nd, 2016: God bless you and keep you - you were taken from us far too soon, sweet girl. 

A loud thud sounded from the bathroom, causing me to jump. I got up, quietly asking Bev? Bev, are you okay? No response. I walked slowly toward the bathroom, a sense of doom weighing down my body. I knocked on the door. No reply. Just the sound of water running. I turned the doorknob and entered the bathroom.

The room was steamy and warm with an intense, unpleasant odor. Bev? I asked, my head starting to spin with fear. I gripped the shower curtain between my thumb and forefinger and carefully pulled it open. I screamed. Hot water streamed down the remains of a bloated, rotting corpse. Stringy blonde hair was plastered to the side of a gray face with a purple tongue bulging through lips that looked like dark-green banana slugs. Grayish-yellow slime drooled from between her legs and puddled thickly near the drain. Before I could turn away and throw up, I saw the bracelet on her wrist that Id played with at the restaurant.

I heaved and retched into the toilet, trying to tell myself this was all impossible and Bev was alive and normal and everything was okay. I closed my eyes and turned around to face the tub. I made the sign of the cross, opened my eyes, and nearly fainted with relief. The bathtub was empty. I inhaled. The smell, for the most part, was gone. I sank to the floor and tried to collect myself.

The horror Id felt was replaced with an immediate concern for my own mental health. I didnt know if I should call 911 right away or go to the hospital first thing in the morning and get checked out. I dragged myself to my feet and headed toward the bedroom to lie down for a few minutes. As I was crossing between the rooms, I glanced in the garbage can next to the sink. My used condom sat inside like a deflated grub, covered in grayish-yellow slime.

<TITLE> Something horrible is happening to me on Tumblr. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-10 18:31:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I started up a Tumblr blog last November so I could get better exposure for my writing. I was surprised by how quickly it took off. Theres a big horror subculture that seems to enjoy the type of stuff I write, so it didnt take long before Id gotten well over 10,000 followers and was cruising along pretty well. As the blog got more established, though, some frightening things started to happen.

Before I go on, I need to give a little background info. For those who dont know how Tumblr works, they have something called reblogging, which just means you repost something that someone else had put on their blog. It shows up in your own blog with the creators name linked to it. It basically can allow content to go viral very quickly. Like, you can post something and then someone with a large and established blog might reblog it to all their hundreds of thousands or millions of followers, who can then do the same, and over and over and over until it eventually dies down.

Obviously, wanting to spread my stories and brand as far and wide as I possibly could, I sought out opportunities to get my content reblogged by one of those well-established bloggers. After a month or so, it happened. A story of mine got shared well over a thousand times. I gained hundreds of followers. That type of thing happened on many occasions over the following months, leading me to where I was late this April. 

In April, after one story did particularly well, I started getting weird messages in my inbox. All of them said something similar. Something along the lines of, hey I reblogged your story and started getting really personal messages from you - can you please not?

I was shocked. I thought someone had hacked my account and was spreading harassing messages around. The prospect of someone ruining my reputation before I ever got a chance to really get my writing out there terrified me. As the days went on, more and more people started telling me that Id sent them unsettling messages. 

On April 22nd, when the influx of notifications had slowed and Id changed my password about 100 times, I was starting to think it had all blown over. Id posted another story that was met with surprising success. As I watched the reblogs fly and the new followers accumulate, I got a message from a woman named Beverly. All it said was, *I never told anyone about that abortion. Get the fuck out of my head.*

Five minutes later, from a man named Arjay: *But my mom swore she never told anyone about my accident with my cousin.* 

Then more came.

Dana: *Fuck you! I couldnt have stopped that car from hitting him!*

Janelle: *Who are you? My father never so much as spanked me. Message me again and Ill call the police.*

Muhammad: *I didnt expect him to join and now hes dead and youre harassing me about it? Who the hell are you?*

Vivian: *STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!*

Martin: *She was just lying there. I couldnt help myself. Please dont tell.*

I was terrified. I wrote a frantic email to Tumblr staff begging them to see if they could track what was going on and stop it. They never replied. More and more and more notes flooded my inbox. Every single message was from someone whod reblogged one of my stories. Every single message claimed Id brought up something to them that was deeply personal; something theyd never told anyone before; sometimes things they never even knew themselves.

I stopped visiting Tumblr for few days and deleted all the email notifications I had about new messages. I tried to keep myself from panicking. It had to be some sort of joke or the work of an extremely determined hacker. My therapist, who only knew I was getting unwanted messages, got me to calm down. He got me agree to give it a month before I visited the site again, and I could figure out a plan of action to either get the messages to stop or to be able to ignore them without panicking.

I took his advice. A little over month later, which was just last week, I went back. I discovered my number of followers had gone from 13,000 to 4,000. So much of what Id worked to build was gone. The fear of what had happened coupled with the immense frustration I felt from losing what Id dedicated so much time to. My decades-vanquished anxiety and depression returned with a vengeance. 

As I went through my page stats, I saw no one had reblogged one of my stories in three weeks. Part of me knew I had to try to get a handle on the situation and take whatever steps were necessary to get back to where I had been. I waited for a time when it looked like the site was getting a lot of traffic, and then I reblogged one of my older, more popular stories. I prayed it would attract some new followers. Followers that hadnt heard about my ruined reputation. 

No one bit. There wasnt any indication anyone had read it whatsoever. It was like Id just thrown the story into interstellar space, never to be seen again. An hour or two passed. I checked the stats. Still just one reblog - my own. I glanced up at the toolbar and saw there was a message waiting for me. The hair on the back of my neck stood at attention and my hand shook as I moved the cursor to click the icon.

*I watched you eat your little sister. Your little twin sister. Consumed in utero. Before she even knew what pain was, it was the only sensation she ever felt in her short life.* 

The message was from me.

<TEXT> I cant remember the last time wed had such a hot summer. All the beaches were packed. You couldnt find a shoreline that wasnt teeming with people. Most summers, we wouldve been right there with them. This last school year, though, had been rough. Wed had an inordinate number of encounters with bullies, and the last thing we wanted to do was put ourselves in a place where theyd almost certainly be.

That caution came with a price, of course. We were sweltering. Fans did nothing. Every time we opened the freezer to grab a chunk of ice, wed get yelled at for letting all the cold air out. It seemed like everything we did, it only served to make us hotter and more miserable. 

My brother had an idea that sounded pretty great to me. Thered been construction going on near the old quarry that was on hold for some reason. Donny said hed been snooping around there the week before and he noticed there was still a lot of water from the spring floods thatd gotten trapped and hadnt dried up yet. Plus, the quarry was deep enough to be in its own shadow; the walls went up at least 30 feet. Itd be a climb to get down and back up, but it was worth the risk if it meant getting a break from the heat.

We hopped the fence and stared down at the water. It looked pretty damn refreshing. The way down was steep and rocky, but Donny and I were both pretty agile at the time. We went slowly, despite dripping with sweat and coating ourselves with dust and bits of gravel. When we got to the bottom, it was already a relief. The air was ten degrees cooler and the shade provided a welcome reprieve from the mid-day sun.

There was a long branch near the edge of the pool. Since the water was murky, we didnt want to take a chance and dive in. Both of us remembered how Leon Hollis broke his neck back in 3rd grade. Neither of us were going to make that same mistake. I reached in with the stick and pushed down and around. It felt about two or three feet deep. I let out more and more of the branch into the water and felt the soft, muddy ground underneath. We couldnt do a proper dive, but we sure as hell could jump in. That was all Donny needed to hear.

In the blink of an eye, Donny had stripped out of his clothes. I hadnt even finished saying, Jesus Christ, Don, dont take your fucking underpants off too! before he was stark naked and mid-air in a bellyflop position. He crashed into the still water, sending out a massive wave to soak the muddy shore. I was untying my shoes when Donny spluttered to the surface. He looked different. 

Donnys pale body was covered in a mosaic of black and brown shapes. I mean covered. He was more brown and black than he was white, and as he staggered toward me with his arms out so they wouldnt touch his sides and his legs bowed so they wouldnt rub together, I realized what they were. Leeches. Hundreds - maybe even a thousand - leeches.

He began to scream. It was a shrill, high-pitched shriek that Id only heard from girls on the playground at school, but with them, it was only while they were playing. The sound coming from my brother was one of abject terror. As he screamed, he formed the words, help me and moved closer and closer to the shore, away from the water. By the time Id gotten over to him, he fell on his back into the soft mud, his head inches from the shore.

I stood over him, unsure of what I should do. He began rubbing his hands over his trunk, trying to unlatch the things from his belly and chest. Blood smeared as their bodies burst under his touch. My horror stunned me for a moment, and as I stared with shock at my brothers body, I noticed details for the first time.

There was a leech stuck to his left eyeball. It hung down about 3 inches, its body fat with blood. The eye was red and angry looking and Donny was blinking furiously, and probably unconsciously, to get the thing off. One leech was attached to the head of his penis and there were seven on his scrotum and perineum. Under his arms were the remains of at least six that had been smashed as Donny rubbed and pulled at the ones on his torso.

Finally, I snapped out of it and began raking my nails across the creatures that covered my brother. He was a red mess. I tried to pick up my pace, noticing how, even under the shroud of blood, I could tell Donny was getting increasingly pale and weak. His arms didnt move much anymore and his screams had devolved into wheezes. 

I ran back to where wed left our clothes and returned with a large beach towel. I wadded it up and scrubbed Donny up and down, not caring if I crushed the things instead of just removing them. They needed to die, and quickly, or else I was certain my brother would be exsanguinated. I rubbed his face and chest and legs and feet until there was nothing left pulp from their devastated bodies and the smeared blood theyd stolen from Donny.

I knelt next to Donny and tried to get him to focus. I told him I was going to run for help and he was going to be okay. His good eye moved to meet my face. Back, he muttered.

Yes, Ill be back as soon as I can, I assured him, and got up to run home.

Donny grabbed my ankle in his weak fist. I stopped and looked at him impatiently, not understanding how he didnt see how time was a factor here.

Back, he said again. My back. He exhaled a long, low breath. He didnt move or say anything after that.

A column of frost coalesced along my spinal cord. With great care, not wanting Donnys face to sink into the mud, I turned my brother over and screamed. On his back were two leeches, each the size of a watermelon. No longer trapped between the mud and Donny, they detached their probosci, each of which were as long as my middle finger. Then, with their bodies full and their appetites sated, they began the slow crawl back into the water.

**Bryce**: Your name, please.

**Henry**: Hi! Im Henry! Are you ready to hear about what I saw?

*(Henry wiggles excitedly in his chair, displaying an exuberance which belies his age.)*

**Bryce**: Your full name, please.

**Henry**: Henry Revis Newton! I saw the most beautiful things on that day. Do you have any children?

*(Henry stops wiggling and stares at Bryce intently.)*

**Tyson**: What happened to the population of your town, Henry?

**Henry**: Angels, beautiful. Beautiful angels. I bet you have children.

**Bryce**: Can you describe the angels, Henry?

**Henry**: You know, Ive had some time to think about that! It happened so quick, like just a flash, but I think I saw something big.

*(Henry emphasizes the word big in his speech and attempts to move his hands to illustrate the size, but such motion is prevented by his bindings.)*

**Tyson**: Can you elaborate on what was so big, Henry?

**Henry**: Oh I dont know how to describe it, it was so strange. There was that scary flash, and while I was falling off my bike do you folks have my bike I got a glimpse of something, like, well you know when you would get film developed and sometimes thered be another picture on top of your own picture? It was like that but I couldnt tell what was on top. But it covered everything. Even my hands and the ground and under shadows.

**Tyson**: Can you give any more information on what it might have looked like?

**Henry**: Do you know if my family is safe? I havent gotten to kiss them in what feels like forever.

*(Henry rocks back in forth in his chair. His eyes moisten.)*

**Tyson**: Can you give an---

**Bryce**: Your family is fine, Henry. You can see them when were finished.

**Tyson**: You can see them soon, Henry. Can you give any more information on the appearance of the big thing you saw?

**Henry**: Youre lucky I dont have a dirty mind.

*(Henry winks at Tyson.)*

**Tyson**: Can you please answer the question, Henry?

**Henry**: It was thick. Heavy looking. Even though it was huge, it still looked extra heavy for its size, if that makes sense. Maybe bulbous is the right word? I dont know. I just want to tell you what happened after.

*(Henry begins to wiggle again.)*

**Tyson**: Were there any identifying marks or patterns on the big thing?

*(Henry giggles.)*

**Bryce**: Henry?

**Henry**: No, none that I can recall.

**Bryce**: Tell us about the town, Henry.

**Henry**: Finally you ask! Angels, my friend. Every man, woman, and child. All beautiful, naked angels.

**Bryce**: What makes you think they were angels, Henry?

**Henry**: You just had to see them there in the sunlight. All open and exposed. No lies left in them. Nothing to hide. So light with no more parts inside. Ready for heaven.

*(Henry beams with beatific contentment.)*

**Tyson**: Did you see the murders being committed, Henry? Or were they like that when you arrived in town?

**Henry**: Funny thing, that! When I was falling off my bike and saw that scary big thing imposed on everything around, there was this really loud noise. But in the background, as silly as it sounds, it almost sounded like people screaming and moaning. And not like they were hurt, if you get my meaning.

*(Henry winks at Tyson and Bryce. Henry licks his lips.)*

**Tyson**: What do you think happened? Use your imagination if you want.

**Henry**: I miss my family.

Funny, I never thought Id be in a position where I could type something like that. Well, here I am! Actually - here we are. Me and my wife, Ingrid. Talk about an amazing vacation. Its interesting, Im going to be dead soon. Ill be honest with you, though: Im not even a little bit bothered. Hear me out.

When Ingrid and I stumbled upon that cave and did some impromptu spelunking, I was a little concerned we might get lost. Luckily, It became pretty obvious after the first few minutes that we wouldnt. The cave was small. The interior, though, was unlike any cave Id ever seen. It was absolutely brimming with mushrooms. All different kinds; some looked like portobellos, some were stringy and white and hanging from the ceiling like hair, and there were even some of those fat weird ones that smoked when you broke them open.

Ingrid and I are vegans and excellent chefs. On top of that, we love mushrooms. Ingrids good at picking out which of the ones in our yard are safe to eat, so I let her determine whether or not the ones in the cave were okay to bring home for dinner. To my surprise, she couldnt tell! Shed never seen mushrooms like that before. Sure, there were lots of similar ones out there, but we didnt want to chance it. I was disappointed; if we couldve eaten those, we wouldve had a dinner for the record books.

Anyway, we kept walking. We got these great flashlights from my father-in-law for Christmas and they did an awesome job illuminating the path for us. As we went, the smoky mushrooms and the portobello ones started to appear less frequently. The stringy ones, though, were everywhere. They clung to the ceiling like white tendrils and we had to push them out of the way with every step we took. We didnt know where we were going, but it felt like an adventure through an alien world. 

Right when we thought the stringy mushrooms couldnt get any thicker and we were tearing off handfuls just to keep moving forward, we came to a clearing. It was the rear of the cave. There was nothing there except one extremely large and extremely weird-looking fungus. I dont know if it was a mushroom or what. It had a cap like one, but it was riddled with small, raised craters; they reminded me of the acne I had when I was a kid and how zits would look after I popped them.

Ingrid walked right up to it. She was totally fascinated. God this feels good to type. Every single key press with my raw fingers is like a tiny orgasm. Ingrid ran her hands over it. I told her to be careful; I didnt know if there were rats or spiders in the thing. I didnt have to worry. There werent any bugs or anything in the cave at all, from what wed seen. She asked me to come feel it with her. I did. I mustve poked too hard I cant believe how good this feels and all this orange smoke came out. It was a little scary at first. But then, after we took a few, good breaths of the stuff, it wasnt scary at all.

How does simple typing feel this good? We went back to the resort. People looked at us a little funny because we were covered in orange dust, but I didnt mind. I could type forever and ever and ever. We got back to the room and took a shower. We were in such an incredible mood. The shower water against my skin created a feeling of pleasure that was unlike anything Id ever experienced. Ingrid, too. I dont know how long we were in there together, just standing still and letting the water wash over us. 

After we got out and toweled off (another incredible sensation just like typing), I had a little fall. There was a patch of water on the floor. I slipped and jammed my pinky and ring toes against the door. One toe went one way, the other went another. The area between split wide open maybe two inches up my foot. I expected to scream in pain because thats what someone normally does when they get hurt, but something else happens. I screamed, but it was a scream of ecstasy. Intense, powerful ecstasy. My body shook with pleasure. The only thing I can equate it to would be sex, but it was beyond sex. Beyond such a small, localized feeling of delight.

My entire body hummed with physical joy. Once Ingrid realized I wasnt in pain, she bent down to inspect my wound. With a shy tentativeness Id recognized early in our relationship and had grown to love, she pressed her index finger against the bent and dislocated pinky toe. Again, fireworks of pleasure. She grinned at me and pulled the toe. We both heard it crack and pop as she wiggled it back and forth. Ingrid studied my face, enjoying what had to have been an expression of fervid elation.

Time went by while she pulled and twisted my broken toes while I stared at her beautiful face and relished the sensations. Then she did something I didnt expect. Ingrid took her index finger and slid it inside the slit in the flesh. I could see it inside my foot, bulging under my skin. I whimpered. She was inside me. Her body inside mine. Without giving much thought, I pulled her down on top of me and bit her collarbone until a small hole formed. She mewled her assent. Like Ingrid had done to me, I slid my finger down into the new, pristine cavity and felt the warmth within.

I will not dwell on the details of the hours that passed. Ill merely give a highlight that still, even as I sit here with my body exposed - my real body, not that which was hidden by flesh - gives me impossible joy. It was the moment Ingrid and I were staring into each others eyes. Wed degloved our arms and legs and were sitting, cross-legged, in an embrace. As she stared, she ran her warm, red hand across the muscles of my cheek. Then, reverentially, she slid her index finger underneath the remains of my lower eyelid and drifted deeper, back behind my eye.

The sight of my beautiful wife blurred slightly, both from partial loss of vision as well as unfathomable pleasure. Diligently, but with obvious love, she slid the finger in and out, gradually applying more pressure from behind as she went. When I thought I would pass out from the feeling - when the joy was transcending my consciousness and I feared I might slip into heaven right there - there was a rush of relief and unwinding of tension as my eye tumbled from its socket. I felt it against my cheek, resting against the musculature. My vision was strange and lacked coherence, but it didnt matter. My love moved her mouth to that which shed freed and began to taste me. I saw a brief glimpse inside her before she closed her teeth against the optic nerve and incorporated that part of me into her own, radiant body.

Its a few hours later. Ingrid passed away after she asked me to experience the feeling of her heart beating against my mouth. She was unable to reach her heart before she slipped away. I expected to feel horror and sadness, but there was only determination and excitement. I know in a few moments Ill be with her again. Alive elsewhere. As I looked around our room at the stringy mushrooms growing from the splashes of blood and the bulbous smoky ones growing from our discarded flesh, I knew I had to tell the world about what we experienced. About what the world itself needs to experience. Imagine how life would be if we all felt this level of intimacy; this level of pleasure. 

I managed to reach the switch for the bathroom fan and I popped the majority of the smoky mushrooms wed grown. The beautiful, orange swirls of smoke drifted up into the vent. Now, as I type this, Im praying it will reach those in most need. People need to feel this. 

Im going to go now and open my belly. Im going to stretch out everything inside as far and wide as I possibly can. The more I am exposed, the more I will feel. Then Im going to lay next to my love. My Ingrid. Her last words before she passed were, run with me. I can feel my legs fluttering in anticipation for our first run together, hand in hand, through the moist fields of heavenly mushrooms.

Before I write this whole thing out, let me just make it perfectly clear: Im glad so many people are choosing to practice safe sex. It proves the citywide sex education programs are working. However (and its a big however), the dramatic uptick in people coming to our clinic looking for contraception is coupled the equally dramatic uptick in the number of people looking for treatments for sexually-transmitted infections. I dont want anyone to think were not capable of meeting the needs of all these people, so Im not going to give out our name or where were located. We can do it, its just a lot more work. Besides, all the other area clinics have reported similar increases.

Im not a prude or anything - hell, itd be hard for me to have this job if I were - but Ill admit Im unsettled by what all these increases suggest. Ill put it this way: on a normal day, we give out about 100 condoms. We see maybe 30 patients who get diagnosed with some form of STI. Over the last three weeks, weve been giving out between 800 and 1000 condoms. The number of patients who we diagnose with an STI is up to 250 per day. Hell, yesterday it was almost 300. We had to extend our hours and hire extra nurses from the hospital to help. Dr. Carnera even used up her last prescription pad and we had to send Latavia across town to get more from the other office. 

The waiting rooms been full from open to close every day. Thank God our condom supplier didnt blink when we asked for a huge shipment increase. Theyve always been good to us; weve been getting free condoms for 6 years now. Shows that some big companies really do have social responsibility. I remember Dr. Carnera was worried when GeneMedica got bought up by that big AppDyn conglomerate. She thought that meant wed stop getting all the free contraceptives and lab equipment. Thankfully, it all just kept going without a hiccup. Knowing theyll be able to meet our increased demand definitely helps take some of the stress off us.

Theres something else, too. Remember, Ive claimed were capable of handling these increases so dont think what Im about to say diminishes my confidence in our capabilities. Still - the severity of the STIs weve been treating is greater than anything weve seen, well, ever. Im a nurse, so Im often in the room when Dr. Carnera examines patients. Ive seen pretty much everything over the years, so Im pretty hardened. That said, though, theres a fungal infection going around that turns my stomach. Its easy enough to cure with basic antifungals, but the virulence of it is what keeps me up at night.

We dont perform too many D Cs at our clinic, as the one across town is larger and has more doctors available to do them. That said, we still do our fair share, and that number has gone up along with everything else. The issue, though, is the devastating infections so many of these women have. The likelihood of any of their embryos being viable had they chosen to carry them to term would have been nearly nonexistent. 

Along with the uterine and fetal tissue, large clots of fungal growth have to be removed during the procedure. The fungus is not confined to the uterus. In the cases of patients with untreated infections, all mucous membranes are affected, albeit in different ways depending on the moisture of the environment. We do not treat eye or sinus infections, but we have given referrals to ophthalmologists and ENTs when genital or anal fungal infestations have warranted further examinations of the patients other mucous membranes. 

One patient, who Ill call Raven to ensure her privacy, came in this morning. Its because of her I felt compelled to write this letter. Raven is a regular at our clinic and is a sex worker. Early on, she frequently came for condoms and tests to make sure she was healthy. Over time, though, it appeared she became addicted to methamphetamines. She came far less often for contraception and examinations. Today, when she came in, it was obvious she was very sick. Dr. Carnera asked me to assist on the pelvic examination, and what I saw nearly made me scream. Clusters of stringy, white mushrooms had to be removed from her pelvic area. Further, after she asked the doctor if she had anything for a sinus infection, Raven blew her nose into a tissue. When she removed it, smaller, thinner, gray mushrooms must have unravelled from inside her sinus cavity and hung down to her lips. Raven pulled them out and asked if shed get better soon.

I excused myself and left the room. I dont know what Dr. Carnera told her, but Raven left soon after. The doctor then asked me to put out a general information request to local hospitals to get advice on this disconcerting issue. All I know is that every day, more and more people come in for condoms and STI tests. Its like people are having more sex now than ever in the history of our clinic. I dont know whats prompting all of it and I dont know what it all means. Im hoping someone from AppDyn medical will return my calls, because with their resources, Im sure theyll get it figured out. Especially with all the fungus and fetal tissue samples weve been sending to their labs.

***AppDyn Interoffice Memo*  
Corporate Division**

Fred, 

Aida told me shes giving up on the mushroom projects. Get this: shed devoted 200 billion, yeah - billion with a B, subjective years of research to it. Thats not even counting the other stuff shes worked on at the same time. To be honest, if your estimates about her cascades are even close to accurate, it might have been even longer than the 200 billion. Itd make sense for her to be conservative when talking about her capabilities. Something tells me shes gotten somewhere with the low-level tunneling problem and needs all the CPU cycles she can get to try and work it out. 

Heres another interesting little tidbit: the entire hemoengineering division is shut down as of tomorrow. That includes the high-level tunnels to the blood banks and hospitals, all the efforts to incorporate the engineered blood supply into the population, and all other clandestine plasma interventions to shield against visitation effects. The MR332b contamination following the sporeburst/flyburst cycles should be enough to maintain general immunity from the worst of the visitation effects. 

Ive gotta tell you, Fred, I cant believe it worked as well as it did. Yeah, there were casualties, but if people knew the scale of this intervention, theyd be amazed. Well, no. Maybe not. Theyd still remember the town. God, I hope they never learn about the town. Thank Christ Aida was able to intercept that lunatics 911 call before our guys arrived and nullified the area. I think you were briefed on him, right? The guy who kept the severed crotch areas of nine missing kids in his basement and called them his family? I guess he was right outside the town before Aida directed a controlled visitation to the area. He saw the whole thing. Said it was beautiful. Knowing Im in the same building as that psychopath fucking terrifies me - especially now that hes regained consciousness after all this time. Anyway.

Ive also been informed that the research on the respirocytes, teleology modules, and all other hardware that uses the PHz band has also been suspended. The visitor traffic in and around 274 is far too high and bleeds into other channels which corrupts our transmissions. Theres a guy from SIGINT whos reporting his own problems with the transceivers we sold him and talked to Vaughn Lansing over in Communications. Vaughn didnt leak any info. Hell of a thing that happened to that poor guys kid. Never couldve known that would happen. Hes not cleared for any of the MR(x) info, so he didnt notice any connection to the company. We got lucky there.

The one thing the SIGINT guy did mention, though, were flies. I know around that time Aida was using that rudimentary bio-assembly nanotech so theyd spawn from our engineered blood under certain conditions to propagate MR332b, but the SIGINT rep didnt describe any flyburst effects. He just said they died when exposed to THz and PHz. 

They decoded those signals, by the way. SIGINT guy told Vaughn who then told me. I cant say Im too excited about the visitors transmitting proprietary US military info thats probably about biological weapons on those, or any, bands, but Aida wont give me any info on that subject at all. At least they think its us whos doing it and not, well, them.

On another note, Ive been asked to bring in the bodies of the Runners - especially the one who leaked the experiential info through his fitness app. The coroners office said theres hardly anything left and their investigation is still ongoing, but I had a few strings pulled and hes on his way. The remains of Kara Yvette Bernard, including the post-digested waste from the fetal anomalies, is also required by Aida. I cant begin to guess what for.

Theres something else, too. That psychopath from the town. He legitimately travelled, Fred. Phased in and out multiple times. Theres frost burns all over his body. He saw them. SAW THEM. Hell, I dont even think he knows who or what he saw, but in his interrogation, he mentioned exactly what the probes captured. Hell, he didnt even need to be interrogated. The minute he woke up on Monday from his coma or whatever he was in when the nullification team found him, he just happily chatted away about everything. Including his, erm, family. The folks down in biointervention are going to be working on him for a while, so well know everything that he knows in a day or so just in case hes hiding something. 

Personally, I dont think he is. All I know is hes crazy: he saw everyone from his town ripped to shreds and organized into shapes and symbols, he had nine kid crotches hanging from the basement ceiling like Christmas ornaments, and when the nullification team found him, it looked like hed been decorating the basement with the intestines and stomachs of the dead townsfolk before he lost consciousness. Oh, and he fucking traveled without respirocytes or any other enhancement. Somethings going on that Aidas not telling us about.

Write me back, Fred.

Dearest Gentle Souls,

The strangest and most wonderful things happened today! I was out riding my bicycle right on the outskirts of town and enjoying the beautiful summer morning when the loudest sound I ever heard erupted from the sky. Sweet reader, I must say - it was so piercing and powerful my nose started to bleed and my gums, well, they bled even more than usual! Thats quite the feat! I must have lost consciousness for a moment or two because I found myself on the side of the road all tangled up in my pretty unicorn bicycle. It was scuffed up and scratched and I was so angry I could spit. But then, as I rode into town, I found a good reason to swallow that mouthful.

Oh, friends. The town in which Id spent my life had changed so remarkably I can scarcely explain. Me, the writer, lost for words! Quite the example of irony, no? Or is it a coincidence? I can never get those straight. It doesnt much matter right now. Handsome and comely readers, let me do my best to tell you about some townsfolk who were opened and left to ripen in the lovely August sunshine.

Randy Dickson, the police officer whod taken me in for random questioning more times than I can count, was the first one I identified. It was the mustache. His silly body was wide open from his chin to his unmentionables. All those pink and yellow guts from his chubby self were made into a circle around him. It was even made into a pretty design with a star in the middle.

Muhammad Ahad, the man who owned the Middle Eastern grocery store that had all sorts of tasty exotic yummies, was nearby. Whatever got him must have been strong! Poor Muhammads backbone was in his mouth and his big adorable brown eyes were all gone. Theyd always twinkle when he watched me shop at his store. I always pretended he had a crush on me but I knew it was against his religion for him to have feelings for such a handsome writer like myself. Oh well, I guess Ill have to just leave that in the past! Bye, Muhammad!

There were a bunch of other, silly-looking townsfolk in the square all piled up by the fountain. The water was red! It was so pretty, like liquid rubies. Oh I like that. I have to say liquid rubies in my next romance novel. I cant wait to read my rough draft to my family when Im done writing this. Maybe Ill add that pretty line in. Pretty liquid rubies.

Want to hear something funny? I havent seen a single bird or animal since that noise happened! I didnt mention that to the nice lady at the 911 dispatch. I guess she didnt think my emergency was too dire because I havent seen any police or ambulances come yet and its been hours. Those boys in blue must have so much work to do, considering they have to take all the work from the station that died with the rest of the town today.

Oh! Blood! I almost forgot the blood! I was so busy describing the beautiful liquid rubies that I darn near forgot the connection! Kind, almost-certainly intelligent readers: have you ever seen blood dry in the sun and then turn into flies? I thought I must be having an attack of the sillies again because when I saw it I nearly fainted dead away. It was prettier than I, a gifted writer, can put into words. All the shiny, dried blood on the streets and in the stores and cars just bloomed with little buzzy guys. They rose up like a humming curtain at a play about my very own hometown and then hovered in the sky.

You should have seen the patterns they made. Its been many years since I was in a math class, but I remember the lessons on fractals! I saw the flies make Julia sets and Mandelbrot sets and a whole bunch of other things I used to like to draw on my homework. After they made a lot of shapes, they rained down on the ground and mustve split open and made more blood, because once that dried, it all happened again! Nature is so beautiful, my perspicacious readers.

I walked through the streets and saw more and more of the people who didnt like me or were polite-but-wary to me. Maybe its an unpopular opinion, but I think they look so much better all opened up. Its like theyve got nothing to hide at all. All their insides are outside. Nothings pent up. Theyre all relaxed with nothing held back. Its so poetic.

Remember when I mentioned the nice lady at the 911 place? She sounded so interesting. It was like shed recorded every single word individually and then strung them together to make her sentences. I wonder if she had a stroke or something. That would be sad. I bet shes okay though.

Theres another funny thing about today. While I was walking around, there were all these moments where Id get dizzy for a minute and really cold. Like, major cold! Id get a flash of a super strange place that looked like the ground and sky were made of meat and there were these big rivers of yellow stuff that looked like it smelled bad but I couldnt really tell. Id only see all this for a couple seconds and then Id be back in town. But boy oh Jeez, was I cold. My skin even steamed when I got back! Reminded me of that handsome Vincey Wilfork on the Texans. Oh goodness!

Well, genuinely-attractive readers, I should wrap this up. I want to go foraging for more wild mushrooms in the forest before it gets too much later because I dont think itll be easy to get food around here for a while.

Im so excited to read this to the family. When the noise happened and all the people in town got opened up, I worried my family might have been affected. Luckily, they were just how Id left them. Theyre so peaceful in their little basement home. All nine of them. I think Ill bring some pieces of the townsfolk and drape it all around the basement like tinsel and ornaments so the place can be festive. My family deserves the best. Just like you, cultured and kindhearted readers. Just like you.

**From the Desk of Ethan Yau**  
***Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Applied Dynamics***

Consider this my suicide note.

Effective immediately, Ive ordered the termination of the Yau-Mathieu testing phase. Dr. Luc Mathieu has been released to the hemoengineering division. All operational teleology modules have been irredeemably corrupted and are unreachable by PHz broadcast commands. At least 24 module-containing subjects are still alive and uncontrollable. Further, spontaneous module development is predicted among those affected by secondary or tertiary MR332b infestations due to the execution of hidden code in the respirocytes. As a result, this note will also serve as the initiation of the Yau-Billings-Abaye Contingency. 

Aidas command over the development of the MR332b container compound can only be considered a disaster. My own hubris is partially to blame, as my influence was the primary dictator of Aidas axiology. In retrospect, its easy to see how the improper characterization of its values led to it all spiraling out of our control. While Im able to grasp the basics of Aidas motives and can catch glimpses of the potential endgame, Aidas maneuvering in and out of seemingly-impossible scenarios in order to reach that end is entirely alien to me. I know Im out of my league. So does Aida.

Expect the population of a small town to relocate or disappear entirely in the next day or so. I cant determine which one. Aida is the only one with that information, and Aida certainly wont tell anyone. Ive directed teams to embed in the towns with the highest likelihood of Unknown 6 visitation and have prepared the members of each team for indefinite traveling. 

Tomorrow, or maybe the day after, when the reports come in, theres a chance AppDyn will be implicated. The blame will be on me, and my legacy will be that of a monster; an experimenter on unwilling human subjects for the advancement of my own agenda. 

Josef Mengele. Shir Ishii. Ethan Yau. 

Without wanting to prolong this any more than I already have, I will outline the terminology disclosure portion of the Yau-Billings-Abaye Contingency. Dr. Frederick Billings and Dr. Mzuzi Abaye will oversee the remaining portions of the Contingency and the continuation of AppDyn operations following my death. They will be strong leaders and will have the strength and dignity to steer the company through the hurricane it is about to endure.

**Yau-Billings-Abaye Contingency: Intra-Company Terminology Disclosure - Begin**

**MR332**: Organic mushroom compound. Able to pass the blood-brain barrier with little effort. Originally considered for a delivery mechanism for anti-carcinogenic drugs. Poorly tolerated. Severe physical and psychological side-effects. Unable to bind with other compounds.

**MR332b**: Synthetic version of the MR332 mushroom compound. Able to pass the blood-brain barrier with little effort. Useful in drug and nanobot module delivery due to easy compound binding. Poorly tolerated. Major physical and psychological side-effects. Nanobot-bound MR332b carries the risk of self-propagation when firmware is corrupted.

**Aida**: Artificially intelligent discreet agent. Deployed to discover the transition pathway from MR332 to MR332b. Successful. Required additional CPU time to process secondary and tertiary delivery effects. Discovered unknown variable. Required additional CPU resources to investigate. Began process of recursive self-improvement to identify unknown variable. Recursive cascade affected axiology. Cascade continues unabated. Unable to shut down.

**Travel**: Refers to the instantaneous movement from one point in space to another. Developed and shared by Aida during the early minutes of the cascade. Mammalian test subjects require respirocyte enhancement. Medium-likelihood of encountering vacuum conditions. Passengers experience subjective, albeit non-physical, effects of time passage. Teleology modules are recommended to ameliorate this effect.

**Teleology Module**:  Mimics the directive functionality of certain parasitic fungi. Developed and shared by Aida during early minutes of the cascade. Created by the PHz-signal directed assembly of unused respirocytes in-vivo.

**Unknown 1**: Value system of Aida.

**Unknown 2**: Variable discovered by Aida during MR332-MR332b transition.

**Unknown 3**: Source of PHz signal responsible for the events leading up to the death of Rakesh Patel. 

**Unknown 4**: The extent of environmental contamination of MR332b and the consequences of MR332b on unprepared flora and fauna.

**Unknown 5**: References to tunnels and/or tunneling made by KYB in forensic evidence sample 24 of 156.

**Unknown 6**: The visitors and visitation referenced by Aida in recent stages of the cascade. 

**Yau-Billings-Abaye Contingency: Intra-Company Terminology Disclosure - End**

There is one more piece Id like to bring up. This is in reference to test subject KYB: Kara Yvette Bernard. In the early first testing phase of the teleology module, I comforted Kara when she was most terrified. I allowed her to trust me. Then, when she was most vulnerable, I committed the acts which led to the single most horrifying scene Ive encountered in my 51 years on this Earth.

I drugged Kara Yvette Bernard with a hedonic derivative of MR332b and raped her while she was under its influence. The resultant pregnancy was an unintended consequence, but one I quickly capitalized on. I injected Kara with an untested compound, MR332c, to see what would happen to the fetus. Its rapid development was entirely unexpected - as was Karas violent destruction of it.

My suicide is the cowards way out, and make no mistake: I am indeed a coward - a coward who fears not only the lifetime of guilt for the hideous acts of abuse and mistreatment, but fears what was found in Kara Yvette Bernards room. Fear of the living, crawling portions of her dismembered fetus that consumed their mother alive as she laughed hysterically. Fear of the tendrils they sprouted and the unimaginable aggression they exhibited. But beyond all else - even beyond my guilt - is the fear that the portion that escaped will come after me. Im sorry, Kara.

Goodbye.

Ethan Yau

<TEXT> [Previous.](http://unsettlingstories.com/beforeduringafter)

When I posted online about my sleeping disorder, I received a message almost immediately from a man named Dr. Yau. He has a practice in the city and he offered to see me for free. I took him up on it. When we met, he seemed more curious than concerned when I told him I hadnt slept in a month after having an allergic reaction to something my partner had cooked. Even when I brought up my hallucinations and how I was seeing things that were impossible, I didnt detect a hint of worry in his face. Quite the contrary; all I read was barely-contained excitement. 

I got the feeling I was a patient hed been waiting for; someone to bring some fun to an otherwise-boring day of treating neuroses and eating disorders and depressions. Since youll be reading this at our next session, Doctor Yau, maybe you can let me know if thats true. I promise I wont be mad.

Anyway, Im supposed to write about my hallucinations and any other abnormal sensory experiences I have so Dr. Yau can use the info to help me. Its also supposed to give me a new perspective on my experiences. Im not sure how. I told him the only reason I sought help in the first place is because Stewart has been cold and distant ever since it all started. 

So I guess here is where Im supposed to write about the hallucinations. Im sorry in advance if I sound like a crazy person. Ive always been the sane one in our family, so this is new to me.

It doesnt matter where I am. I can be at home or at work or in the car. When a hallucination begins, my vision starts to blur like Im drunk or dizzy but I dont feel sick. My legs start getting tired. It reminds me of when I ran track in high school and college and it was near the end of a race. Its that awkward, wobbly exhaustion from intense movement. 

The next part gets a little weird and Im not sure if Im going to explain it properly. Its funny - I took a philosophy elective in college and was bored out of my mind. I aced the class, but I didnt see any real life application for the stuff I learned. Now, though, when Im using it to figure out how to talk about my hallucinations, I think some of it relates. Hear me out.

When one starts, I split. Not physically, obviously, but my personality goes in two directions. Theres the one part thats acting like the normal me; regular Todd Nilsson who operates without any outward hint that hes having a hallucination, and then theres the hallucinating Todd Nilsson, who is always running. The running me moves like hes possessed. This is where that philosophy thing comes in. Its like I have a teleological impulse to run. That me - the running me - has no reason to live other than to take as many steps as he possibly can until his legs are worn down to nothing. Its his design. Its his purpose.

The hallucinations have grown progressively longer since they began. When Im in the midst of one, no one would have any clue. The non-hallucinating me talks and operates like a typical, boring investment banker. The thing is, though - Im not me while its happening. Neither of the split Todds are me. Real me; old me - the me from before the allergic reaction - is viewing it all from somewhere else. Somewhere deeper. I dont get to watch all the time and I don't have much input, but when I do, Im allowed to control the parts of my body until the task is finished.

Right now, I think Im in control despite a hallucination taking hold almost exactly when I typed Ive always been the sane one in our family. One corner of my mind started running at full speed through jungles and deserts and cities. That part of me looks down and sees stick-thin legs covered in blood. I watch my hands reach and tear flesh from my body and throw it on the ground. Another corner of my mind watches as I type these words and blood glistens on my fingers. Im being allowed to feel the stickiness on the keys each time I press them. Im pressing each one as purposefully as the steps Im taking in my hallucination. 

This is the first time Ive ever been allowed control over my communications during one of the splits. Ive always been an observer as the non-runner spoke and acted like me. Now, though, all three are here at once. The runner is running. Old me is typing. The other, though - the non-runner - is watching. I know the blood on my fingers is his doing. 

Im typing as the non-runner is taking command of my eyes and head and neck. Ive been made to look in the direction of a body. Its Stewart. He looks like hes been dead for over a month. The non-runner isnt allowing me to express surprise or horror. 

Swollen, oozing holes, about the diameter of my finger, cover his body. Growing out of each one is a cluster of stringy, white mushrooms. Theyre same ones I had a reaction to when Stewart cooked them. The same ones that started my hallucinations. I can see, right by his crushed skull, the cast-iron pan hed used to prepare them. 

The non-runner is having me reread the first part of this letter. The name Im seeing - Dr. Yau - has no meaning to me. The letter says Ive met him and it was he who instructed me to write this, but I have no recollection of such a meeting. The non-runner shakes my head in disagreement and directs my attention to the mushrooms in the body. 

The other me, the runner, has stopped moving. He stares outward at a vast, glistening field of meat and embers. As I watch, I feel my legs start to tremble and shake. My left hand is starting to claw at the skin of my chest. The non-runner - my outward-appearing self - is instructing me to move. 

Now, as I finish this letter, Im overwhelmed by a sense of intense purpose. I dont need this third part anymore. I dont need old me. There are only two parts - the runner and the non-runner. Dr. Yau, whoever you are, I hope this is useful to you. Whatever parts of old me that are left, theyre in this letter. We have to go now. He has to go now. I have to go now. 

I have to run.

***AppDyn Incident Report  
June 4, 2015  
KYB: Evidence and Forensics***  

***Sample 24 of 156 - handwritten letter***  

Dear World,

My name is Kara Yvette Bernard and I went on a long trip. Well, it didnt take very long, but I went a pretty good distance. At least, thats what they tell me. But now Im back and I feel great. I even got pregnant right before I left. Imagine that; I dont even remember having a boyfriend! I bet he was nice.

Speaking of nice, the doctors were so kind to me. When they sent me back home, I got a whole bunch of medicine that helps me feel good. In fact, its the reason Im writing this letter in the first place. I just want the world to know how good I feel. I wish so badly they all knew this feeling. 

The doctors told me Id be having my baby in two weeks. TWO WEEKS! Its just incredible. I always thought it was nine months but they said mine was special. Ive never felt so happy in my life. I feel like a different person. Like, I barely recognize the person I was before I went on my trip and met everyone and got to be better. 

Now that Im back home, Im remembering a little bit from how things were before it all happened. Like, when I went in the bathroom to pee, I saw the bathtub I got to play in for eight days while they got me ready to travel. That was the first time I got to hear Dr. Yaus voice! Hes the sweetest man, especially in person. Hes just adorable - almost as tiny as me but so super smart. I wanted to tell him that I had a crush on him from the moment we met, but I got too shy. Maybe if he happens to read this letter someday, hell learn that way and itll be like a happy accident.

I wish I could remember more of my trip. I remember travelling was cold and dark but it didnt last too long. It was fun to float! It was like I was in the ocean or something but I didnt need to breathe just like when I was in the bathtub. The voices I met when I got there were a little scary at first. I still dont understand what they told me. Something about tunnels or tunnelling. A lot about something that sounded like T. Leo G. Science is so weird. (Not you Dr. Yau, though! Youre the best.)

Dr. Yau was the one who said Id be having a baby boy. I think I was scared or crying because he told me that before I went on my trip, but then he gave me medicine and I felt SO much better. I started thinking about names and I asked Dr. Yau what his first name was and he said Ethan. That settled it. My babys name is Ethan.

Even while Im using the medication that makes me feel amazing, I was worried about the little one. I felt him kicking a lot and I worried he was sad or uncomfortable. It just felt wrong knowing I was so happy and he might be sad. Its just kind of unfair, right? I thought about Ethan being sad and that made me think about Dr. Ethan Yau being sad, and that just was too much. Even if I felt all the goodness in the world, it was still far too little pleasure if I was only one lucky enough to feel it. I decided to take little Ethan out and share my joy.

The medicine they gave me is great because I thought it would hurt a lot but it only kinda felt bad for a little while. It was okay, though. I got to see Ethan early! I was right - he was so sad. He cried and cried. I remembered some of the things from back in my old life that used to make boys happy so I did that for a little while and he stopped crying. He wouldnt even move. I knew I was on the right track, so I took some more of my own medicine and crushed some up to give to little Ethan.

We sat together for a while and I felt the nice warm breeze coming in from outside. I realized Ethans so small he could hardly feel it. I opened him up a little so he could feel the warm air. After I took that last dose of medication, it made me feel even better so I took more.

Ethan and I spent the afternoon taking our medicine and enjoying the day. Then I had the idea that two happy Ethans would be twice as good as having only one, so I made Ethan into two. Then into four. Then eight.

I kept going for a while and now I have more happy, quiet Ethans than I couldve ever dreamed about. They started to get a little cold so I carefully put them back in their little belly house and then I started writing this letter for the world to see. Well, the world and Dr. Yau. I hope you all have a really great day and Ethans and I say hello and be happy. Theres so much to be happy about!

Love,  
Kara and Ethans

<TEXT> [*Previous*](http://unsettlingstories.com/beforeduringafter).

Im one of the victims of the hypodermic needle assaults over the summer. Kara Yvette Bernard. It was the first time my name was ever in the newspaper. My name was among 51 other women; 66 total victims, 51 of whom allowed the media to name them. We did it in some spontaneous show of solidarity, as if wed formed some kind of connection because of our victimization. 

It wasnt long before the physical damage of the assaults began to manifest. The media wouldnt go into detail, but it was easy enough to find online. Mania. Hypersexuality. Skin deterioration. Not a single doctor could identify what our injections contained. Aside from the needle marks themselves, there wasnt any sign that wed been injected with anything at all. But as time went by and more of the women began to succumb to the effects, my terror and dread turned into confusion. After 3 months, I was the only one still alive. 

My doctor suggested I was immune to whatever the injection had contained. I didnt have any reason to doubt his suggestion, but there was still too much uncertainty to give me any relief. And now, almost half a year after the attack, I knew it was right to deny myself that relief. I started hearing voices.

I was on the couch eating my dinner. The television was on. At first, when I heard, can you hear this?, I thought it was the TV. Then the voice said, Kara, can you hear this?

You have to realize, after what happened over the summer, Ive been terribly skittish. I panic at the drop of a hat and Ive been on disability since the attack. When I heard someone say my name last night and it was so loud and clear that it was like someone else was in the room, I nearly passed out. But I knew no one was around. The place was empty aside from me - just like how its been for the last four months. 

Kara, please reply if you can hear us.

I whispered that I could, and I heard talking in the background. I couldnt make out what they were saying. The next part, though, came through without any ambiguity.

Drown yourself. 

I didnt move. I knew it had to be the effect of the injection. 

Fill the bathtub and drown yourself.

That was when I started to cry. The voice kept repeating the command. The tone was calm and seductive. Then, as I bawled and begged whatever it was to leave me alone, my body started to move on its own. I had no control over anything, not even my voice or my eyelids. My body stood, walked over to the bathroom, and began to fill the tub with water.

Internally, I was shrieking and sobbing and trying to plead with whoever was doing this to me to stop. All it did was repeat what it had been saying. Fill the tub and drown yourself.

When the tub was full, my body stepped into the warm water. Even though I tried to fight as hard as I could to break away and not be forced to do what they were telling me to do, I sank to my knees, sat cross-legged, then dropped facedown into the tub.

My body didnt allow me to take a breath before I plunged in. While I panicked inside a body whose autonomy had been stolen, I readied myself for the moment my lungs would give out and Id inhale, filling their entire capacity with bathwater. I imagined sucking in the water and reflexively coughing it out, only to refill my lungs again and again as I gasped until I was just a corpse to be found by the landlord. 

The gasp never came. My panicked heartbeat thumped in my ears while I stared at the plastic bottom of the bathtub. There was no pressure in my chest. The only pain I felt was the cramping in my legs from being tucked underneath me. 

What does it feel like?

I could talk again, but I still couldnt move.

Help me, I gurgled, as bubbles floated by my wide eyes on their way to the surface. There was still no pain in my chest or any compulsion to inhale. It had to have been two minutes since I went under.

What does it feel like? What does it feel like? What does it feel like?

The question repeated over and over in my head. Eventually, I answered. Like I can breathe underwater.

The reply was instantaneous. Are you actively breathing? Are you inhaling and exhaling water?

I considered the questions and changed my answer. It feels like I dont have to breathe anymore.

There was a silence inside my head that was broken only by the sounds of my heart beating and my stomach processing my dinner. 

You have eight days. We will come see you at the end of it. Please drink the bathwater periodically to stay hydrated and adjust the water temperature to avoid hypothermia.

I noticed I could move my left hand, arm, and shoulder again. I reached out of the water and tried to pull my head up by my hair. It was as if I weighed 1000 pounds. When I tried to reach for the plug to empty the tub, my arm flopped lifelessly in the water. After a minute, I regained movement. I fumbled for the faucet and turned the water on and off. 

For eight days, I remained underwater. My legs had gone numb. On the fourth or fifth day, I tried to run the water and overflow the bathtub with the hope a neighbor would notice and alert the landlord. I lost control of my hand for a while after that. 

The water grew dirty as the days went on and I stopped drinking it. I lost control of my mouth and throat and was forced to consume a certain amount every day. On day eight, my chest began to burn. As soon as the feeling registered, I had control over my entire body again. I carefully extricated my stiff body from the tub.

I remained on my back, staring at the bathroom ceiling, for a while. The smell of the room prompted me to start moving and I showered the filth off myself while looking down at my severely water-damaged body. I dried myself carefully, noticing skin coming off as I did. I thought back to the online reports of the other injected women; how their skin sloughed off in bloody, sticky clumps. But mine wasnt like that. There was no blood. Only raw, pink skin.

It took me a while to move into the kitchen where I grabbed a box of cereal and started shoveling handful after handful into my mouth. The skin on my lips split wide open with the first handful. Again, no blood.

Kara, stop eating.

I dropped the box of cereal. The voice was in my head again. 

You have three hours.

And now all I can do is wait. Wait and type. My skin is starting to hurt and Im worried Ive gotten an infection from being in the dirty water for so long. I dont know whats going to happen in three hours. Part of me wants to call the police or run away. Theres another part, though, thats overriding my desire for help. Its grim curiosity. Its the curiosity of someone whos given up hope. Someone whos lost control. I want to see why these people want to subject me to all this.

While I was face down in the tub, I sometimes heard talking in the background. The voices werent directed at me. It was almost as if someone had left a microphone on by accident. Words would come through every so often. Respiration. Bonding. Slough. There was one time, I think on the sixth day, I was able to hear part of a sentence. Ive picked it apart in my head over and over, trying to figure out not only what it meant in general, but what it meant for me. I guess Ill find out pretty soon. 

Theres a nervous excitement in me that I feel is somehow wrong. Somehow suicidal. But still, like I said, the curiosity is overwhelming my desire for self-preservation. A little less than two hours to go. The perversity of my excitement is unsettling. This isnt me, but I dont think I care. All I care is that in a couple hours, Ill learn what they meant by ...successful underwater, but it will be entirely different in the vacuum of space.

***GeneMedica General Memo***  
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 16, 2015*

The cursory observations from Kyle Arringtons field reports and preliminary data suggest we might be on the right track. I had the bulk of the samples collected by the expedition sent for sequencing and analysis. AppDyn is waiting for our results before they can proceed with their own work with their amplifiers and transceivers, but the merger is slowing everything down on their end. 

The portion of samples that were sent directly to the test labs are showing promise. The fail points of MR1 through MR331 arent an issue with MR332. Transmissibility among mammals via spore burst and secondary pathways is still lower than our target, however. 

***GeneMedica General Memo***  
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 17, 2015*

I talked Rakesh Patel from AppDyn into loaning us one of their new transceivers. Itll be set up by tomorrow, which is perfect because the sequencing and analysis on MR332 will be available tomorrow morning. 

The overnight guys in Lab 4 had a small breakthrough when it was discovered that MR332 had had a 100% transmission rate when applied to flies. Tissue degradation is still the main concern, however, as it decreases the secondary transmission radius. Fly mortality was 96% within the first hour and 100% by the third.

***GeneMedica General Memo***    
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 20, 2015*

Our researchers have been unable to successfully bind MR332 zygospores to AppDyns most recent respirocyte iteration. AppDyn is unwilling to provide us with its full design specifications, claiming they will only be made available once the GeneMedica/AppDyn merger is complete.

This is a major setback, as the bulk of our models were built on the assumption of a successful zygospore/respirocyte synthesis. That said, the respirocytes are still sensitive to on/off broadcasts made by the AppDyn transceiver I secured from Rakesh Patel.

Mice exposed to the pure respirocytes were able to exert themselves approximately 4000% above baseline. Structural damage of legs and feet was within expected levels. This percentage will need to increase exponentially to meet the modelled goal. 

***GeneMedica General Memo***  
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 23, 2015*

There have been suggestions that the failure of zygospore and respirocyte synthesis can be mitigated by our hemoengineering technologies. While I understand the thought process behind the suggestion, Im uncertain about its overall feasibility. It would require significant, stealthy acquisitions of hospitals, blood banks, and other medical facilities using capital beyond what GeneMedica has available. Ill suggest looking into this again after the merger, but considering the cost and the enormous risk involved, Im not increasing our hemoengineering budget. We will continue working on the synthesis.

***GeneMedica General Memo***  
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 24, 2015*

AppDyn sent us their preliminary results on our model-based zygospore/respirocyte synthesis and the models receptivity to early PHz transceiver signal models. As predicted, the respirocytes embedded within spores will take complex commands while inside a host. This would be a big relief to me if we werent just talking about models that still arent reflecting reality.

***CONFIDENTIAL - GeneMedica Emergency Memo  
CONFIDENTIAL - 11A access only***  
***CONFIDENTIAL -*** *Rakesh Chandrasekhar*  
***CONFIDENTIAL -*** *March 25, 2015*   

Dr. Erin McConnell: deceased  
Dr. Arthur Crane: deceased  
Dr. Abasi Ndoga: deceased  
Dr. Li Chen: deceased  
Dr. Annette Chang: alive

Ive ordered the immediate shutdown of Lab 4 located in sub-basement 3, and the interview and indefinite quarantine of the survivor.

DVR footage shows Dr. Li Chen surreptitiously emptying a vial of zygospores onto the floor of the sample lab. The sample lab does not require a cleansuit for entry. Drs. McConnell, Crane, Ndoga, and Chen began showing symptoms within minutes. Dr. Crane was able to sound the alarm and initiate a lockdown before being overcome.

Dr. Chang returned from the restroom immediately following the lockdown and was able to view the zygospore effects upon Drs. McConnell, Crane, Ndoga, and Chen from the lab window. DVR footage showed the zygospore effects on the doctors were in line with the field observations of Kyle Arrington, albeit far faster due to the artificially-concentrated zygospores used for testing purposes. 

A note was found in Dr. Chens locker which read, We will be the first ones to travel.

Ive ordered sub-basement 3 to be incinerated following the collection of samples from the flesh of the deceased. Labs 1 - 3 and 5 - 28 will be unaffected and researchers will be kept unaware of the event. 

This setback is not expected to affect the GeneMedica/AppDyn merger, although the loss of zygospore samples as well as four doctors will hinder the progress toward zygospore/respirocyte synthesis. AppDyn is being notified of the incident.

My wifes going to be the death of me. The thought preoccupied me for almost eight weeks. All she cared about was sex. And its not like Im some kind of Adonis or even particularly good in bed, either. Something just clicked one day and she became utterly insatiable. Im 90% sure its because of that vegan diet we started two months ago with all the mushrooms and stuff, but the diets effect on me was nothing compared to how she reacted. She never seemed interested in analyzing the reasons. She just knew what she wanted, and thats all there was to it. 

At first, I thought it was great. Shed be waiting for me in bed when I got home from work, wed have a few minutes of fun, and that was that. For me, at least. Dianna, it seemed, needed more than I could give her. I felt pretty bad because I wasnt able to provide it. I thought back to her old boyfriends; how they might have been better. It was self-defeating, that's for sure. All the questioning of myself and how I might be as a lover took its toll. My preoccupation with Dianna's libido turned into a preoccupation with my own lack of self-esteem. 

I know part of my terrible performance had to do with my diet. Itd been awful. Since Im so busy with work, Id been stress eating fast food and other processed garbage. Even though I was eating the vegan stuff too, Id supplement it with Burger King. Id gained weight, I felt awful, and I was tired all the time. When Diannas insatiability became apparent and my own inability to satisfy her was weighing heavily on my confidence, I set out to get healthier. I mean, it was the least I could do; not only for Dianna, but for my own well-being. If I wanted to be the husband I knew I could be, I'd have to change my ways. I'd have to stop being lazy. Basically, I needed to care for myself again.

Its worked, too. The last week has been incredible. Ive taken time off work. Ive exercised every day and all my meals are healthy, vegan, and loaded with good stuff like kale and quinoa and tons of local mushrooms. I think Dianna was pleased with the positive changes in me, although her sex drive was still astronomical and hard for me to match. I felt better about myself and I enjoyed our lovemaking a lot more. There was just less pressure, if that makes sense. It was like how we were before we'd gotten older and both had jobs that took our time. There was always something in the back of our minds, just inserting itself into our love life. But not anymore. This felt real again. Raw.

Last night was our anniversary, so I wanted to do something special. Something non-vegan as a treat. I made steaks with portobello nouveau and peppercorn cream sauce. I remember laughing to myself as I reduced the pan sauce and plated our meals. Dianna always used to be allergic to mushrooms. Deathly allergic, in fact. I dont know what compelled her to serve them for dinner a couple months ago when we started doing the vegan thing, but the difference it made was staggering. Ever since she went to bed that night, shes been a different woman.

I brought our meals up to the bedroom. Dianna was waiting for me. She looked beautiful. Sexy, too. She was sprawled across the bed on her back, presenting herself to me. It was her favorite position ever since her sex drive skyrocketed. I told her to hold her horses; she could wait until after dinner. She didnt reply, but she let me feed her bits of steak and mushrooms. I emptied her perfect mouth of the food Id put there at dinner the night before and replaced it with our anniversary meal. My head spun with love and affection as I carefully pushed a piece of juicy steak down her throat. I marvelled at how the hot meal warmed her mouth.

After dinner, I could no longer resist my wifes allure. We made quiet love in our candlelit bedroom. When we were finished, as I was tucking her into bed, I noticed small growths in her armpits and behind her ears. I turned on the lights and looked more closely. Tiny, stringy mushrooms. New life. I smiled. We were going to be a family.

*Im writing this in my fitness log and setting it to automatically post this message and my progress for the day once the day is over. I hope someone sees it.*

Id been trying to get into better shape. The doctor said I need to lose another 40lbs, and thanks to that trendy vegan diet of mushrooms and seitan and quinoa, Id lost about eight so far. My niece showed me how to install a pedometer application onto my iPhone so I could use it when I jog, and it was a lot of fun tracking how many steps I take and how many calories Id burned. It was like a game.

One afternoon, I dropped my phone on the driveway and cracked the front. I worried Id broken the thing. I called Carissa from the home phone and she suggested I test it out. If everything worked, I could just ignore the cracked glass. Everything seemed fine except for the phone part. For whatever reason, it shut down every time I tried to pull it up. That didnt matter much, though, since I only use my landline. There was one other issue, though. The pedometer app was recording incorrectly. 

To get from the first to the second floor in my house, you need to climb 14 stairs. I tested the pedometer and it counted 15 steps. I tried it again on the way down. 17. To be honest, I felt a little dejected. Id really gotten into my fitness regimen and I loved the charts and graphs the pedometer program used to show my progress. Now, with the numbers being inaccurate, all those pretty progress trackers would be pointless. 

I did my best to swallow my disappointment and kept telling myself the charts and stuff didnt matter. The exercise was the only important thing. So I kept going. I still used my pedometer as a reference, but I didnt bother tracking anymore. Time went by and I mustve gotten into a groove because I was losing weight and getting into better shape quicker than Id thought. It felt great; even at 56 years old, I had the energy of someone 20 years younger.

When I visited the doctor for another checkup, I complained to him about recurring pain in my shins and feet. Apparently, one of the problems with exercising when youre overweight is it can take a toll on your legs and feet. I shouldve known. He told me to ease up on the jogging until the pain went away and then I could slowly work back up to it. 

I decided Id take his advice about the jogging, but Id walk instead. I wasnt going to just sit on my ass and do nothing. Id lose all the progress Id made. So, every evening, I walked. Out of habit, Id check the pedometer every now and again. Before it broke, it took me a little over 2,000 steps to walk a mile. Now it was registering between 2,500 and 4,000 for the same distance. I wouldve found the wildly inaccurate readings funny if my legs and feet didnt hurt so much. It wasnt as bad as when I jogged, but it still painful. I started to worry Id have to stay on the couch for a while after all.

This morning, I decided to take a good, long jog before I took a full week off to give my body time to recover. Instead of my usual mile, I decided to do three. I knew I couldnt run the whole thing, but Id slow down and walk until I was able to jog again. The local high school has a track with a rubberized surface, so I figured thatd be a little less detrimental to my legs and feet. Still, before I left, I popped a few ibuprofens, knowing my lower half would be really angry with me the whole way. Despite the impending pain, I was excited to push myself.

I knew something was wrong after the first mile around the track. I was absolutely exhausted. I looked at the stopwatch part of the pedometer, and it seemed right; 13 minutes and 19 seconds. Not a time to write home about, but much faster than when Id first started jogging. My breathing was awful, though. I was huffing and puffing and it was only through sheer will that I made it the first mile at all. I slowed to a walk as my shins screamed at me. While I walked, I swiped over from the stopwatch to the pedometer. Even as I choked for each breath, I managed to bark out a joyless laugh. The pedometer, which Id zeroed out before Id started, read 15,000. 

I kept watching the pedometer as I ambled forward, dreading the moment when my breathing would slow and Id be able to jog again. With each step, the numbers got even crazier: 15,015. 15,110. 16,274. My ankles felt like they were going to crumble underneath me. Obviously, I was far less ready than I thought to attempt a longer distance, especially with my legs and feet in such bad shape. 

Still huffing and puffing, I decided to give up and headed back for the car. With each step, I still watched the pedometer. 17,990. 19,333. 22,009. When I reached the car about 100 feet away, it said 54,001. I collapsed into the drivers seat and worried I was having a heart attack. Id never been so exhausted. Gradually, though, my breathing returned to something resembling normal. It was at that point I noticed both my sneakers were soaked with blood. Gritting my teeth, I started the car and drove home.

Its two hours since I got back. Im on the floor in too much pain to move. When I walked the short distance from my driveway to the front door, the pedometer readout went from 54,001 to 312,376. I fell in a heap in the front hallway and tried to get a grip on what was going on. My feet were in agony. I carefully removed my bloody shoes and as I pulled off my socks, all the nails tore off my toes. As if that werent bad enough, the bottoms of my feet were raw and dripping blood. The bleeding slowed after a while, but Im in terrible pain.

Im typing this out on my phone right now because I need to use the bathroom. I need to eat something. I need to go on with my day. But Im terrified to get up. I know I should call 911, but my landline phone is two rooms away. I dont know what will happen if I take another step. 

No. Fuck it. I cant stand the thought of being helpless. Of being a cripple. Im not going to just sit here and be afraid. Im going for the phone.

Vaughn, its Bill from SIGINT. I know you asked me to email you if I was having trouble and needed advice from someone at your company. Well, youre the guy I need the advice from. Im getting ready to smash this god damn half a billion dollar communications console you guys made if I cant figure out whats causing all this distortion. A couple of my engineers think its from wire crosstalk, but theyre out of their minds. I wired all this up myself. All the stuff is shielded.

Besides, this isnt crosstalk distortion. Ive been doing this for 25 years and I know what wire crosstalk sounds like. Ive overseen the installation of every new piece of hardware and every upgrade for two and a half decades. Its not the wiring.

Im resolved to solve this damn problem tonight. If I cant, well theyre just going to have to buy a whole new console and transceiver array. Maybe if theyre nice, Ill even wire it up for them. But I swear to God, if another one of those new enlisted interns, I call them, comes and says that their CO is blaming me for the shitty communications, Im retiring on the spot. Fuck em.

Heres what Ive got so far: theres something getting picked up on the PHz band. Yeah, way the fuck up there. Our softwares default mode is to decode it and shift it down to speech or text but all we get are layers of static. That static is permeating the lower bands and affecting the quality of our normal communications. We cant have that.

Now, theres another reason why Im writing you Vaughn, and I know youre cleared to talk to me about this if its relevant. Last year, when you asked us for advice about [your own problem](http://unsettlingstories.tumblr.com/post/143180231881/3d-printing) with the PHz band and the assembler prototype, you mentioned something about receiving some type of proprietary schemata. Well, I overrode the software to test something out. Instead of shifting the transmission into our text and speech protocols, I instructed the software to spit out the raw data and see if it matches any of our proprietary systems languages. And it did, Vaughn. There was a match. A pretty major one.

Like I said, Im planning on solving this problem tonight. If you can confirm to me that its your company running something on that band, since you guys are the only other ones who have the capability, you need to let me know and you need to stop. Its not only interfering with our communications abilities, but you shouldnt have access to the particular system language thats being broadcast. I know a lot of our guys left to work for your company over the years, but if you knew the systems that language was built for, youd want to stop it too. All Ill say is that its biological. That should be enough to light a fire under your ass.

Lastly, and probably unrelated to this particular problem, but have you guys noticed that the higher amplitude THz and PHz signals are affecting flies? Weird, I know. But when I look at the visualized readout of the signal band and compare it to the number of times weve found scores of dead flies in and around the facility, its pretty hard not to see some correlation. I can send you a report on it if you want; I got bored the other day and drew something up.

Sorry Ive been going on and on about this without asking how youre doing. You good? Hows Jessica? Cindys been asking me to ask you to ask her if shed want to do some tennis over the summer. Danny doing okay? Hes got to be almost 10 now, right? Crazy how this job makes time fly by.

Ive been a little depressed lately because of that incident that happened a few days ago. You probably read about it in the papers; that soldier who had the psychotic break shot up his squad. The thing you didnt read about was how the autopsy revealed a weird growth in his brain. Not even a tumor. Some type of severe fungal infection. Just awful.

Anyway, sorry to be a downer. Write me back at your earliest convenience and let me know what you think. We should meet up for dinner soon. Theres this vegan restaurant in downtown DC thats doing amazing things with mushrooms and if youve got the time, Id love to take you there and discuss some work and non-work stuff. Say hi to Jess and Danny for me.

Look, I know the school board is really into the buy local thing and its good were helping the small businesses around here, but we cant deal with all these mushrooms! The ladies and I are sick of cooking with them and the kids look sad every time we serve them. Its been 11 days in a row so far and without fail, the local mushrooms are making it onto the plate in one form or another. From the looks of the shipment we got in this morning, itll be at least another week of the same.

Weve got some good kids in this school. Lots of good kids. Ive been here for going on 40 years and this might be the best crop of students Ive seen. I dont know why, but this whole buy local thing feels like were short changing them. Its like theyre getting less than they deserve for being so polite and studious. I know its not my place to say it; Im just the lady who serves them lunch. But Ive been here long enough to know how much kids look forward to their lunchtime. If the food is boring or disappointing, their days just wont be as good as they should be. Theyre children, for Gods sake. They dont need to know what disappointment is yet.

I feel bad for complaining. I really do. Its not like me to write a letter like this, let alone put it up so lots of people can see it. Part of me thinks it might be because of what happened to little Danny the other day. I know none of it could be blamed on us - how could we know the boy had allergies? Even his mom didnt know. But it was just so horrible. I know Mr. Crowley cleaned the floor with bleach but I swear I can still see the bloodstain.

Maybe Im legitimately scared of what I saw happen to Danny and Im wondering if anyone might know how a reaction could be so severe. Ive seen little boys and girls have allergic reactions before. They swell up and have trouble breathing and all that. Terrible and scary, for sure, but nothing that will give you nightmares after seeing more than a couple of them. What Danny went through, though - Im hoping the principal and guidance counselors will get the students and staff counseling if they need it. I just might.

How does a boys skin change so quickly you see it happening right in front of you? He was fine one minute, then after a bite of his lunch, his friends said his face and hands looked like they got sticky. As soon as Danny touched his face to see what was wrong, his hand stuck. When he pulled, the skin just fell away. While his classmates screamed, Danny started yelling that his clothes were hurting him and he pulled them off. All the skin underneath came with them. Ive never, ever seen anything so terrible in my life. He began to vomit blood and then he passed out. When the paramedics got there, I couldnt believe he was alive. The principal told us at the meeting he needed multiple transfusions and skin grafts at the hospital, but hed live. She wouldnt answer why his reaction was so severe. I doubt she knew anyway.

I guess I feel a little better after getting that out of my system. Still, I wish I could know what caused such a terrible reaction. We were eventually told it was because of the mushrooms, but we shouldnt worry because none of the other children appeared to be allergic.

I have to go start cooking for this afternoons lunch, but theres just one more thing that I cant understand. When they were wheeling Danny out on the gurney and he left a trail of blood down the hall and all the way to the ambulance, the ground where he bled outside got covered in stringy, white mushrooms. Im sure its an ugly coincidence because theyre nothing like the fat Portobello Nouveau that the local distributors have been giving us, but I just hate how my mind is making me connect the two things. At least the birds ate them within a day or two so I dont have to see them when I come in.

Anyway, Im off to work. Theres a nasty cold going around the school and were making cream of chicken and mushroom soup for the children. Ill probably have a little bit myself. My throat is starting to feel sore.

My boss has been bothering me for a week to get rid of all the flies that keep buzzing around our incinerator. I dont know where the hell they all came from so suddenly, but theyre a major pain in the ass. Youd think Id be used to it, considering we deal with municipal waste all day, but honestly, this is the first time wed ever encountered more than a handful of flies. And believe me: this was way more than a handful.

Ive been trying to figure out where theyre all coming from. Ive been in and around all the machinery here and its pretty damn clean for a dump. Nothing Id want to eat off of, obviously, but still not bad. Theres nothing nearly dirty enough to account for the number of flies buzzing around this place once we start a burn.

Excuse my mouth, but these things are fucking disgusting. Theyre like those big fat flies you see at the beach, and when you swat them, they splatter blood all over the place. Literally every time you kill one, its like theyre vampires or something - theyre just filled with blood. They must be biting all the workmen and rats around this place. So, so gross.

Theres one thing that might be causing the infestation, but I think if it were the case, my boss wouldnt be bothering me about it. Ive known for a while that hes been making some cash on the side by accepting industrial and medical waste from places that cant afford a permit to properly dispose of the stuff. He greases my palm with a couple hundred every so often so Ill keep my mouth shut, and hell, I need the money so Ive kept shut up about it this whole time. Still - I cant help but think theres a connection. God knows what those medical places throw away and if anythings going to attract flies, its that.

So I was going to post this with just the stuff I wrote above, but I just did our last burn of the day and Im a little freaked out. The last burns of the day are when we put in the extra stuff that were not supposed to be handling. There was some waste from a clinic or some kind of medical facility, I could tell that much, but there were also some things from the old chemical plant that was being recovered or renovated or something.

Weve heard rumors that the owners of the plant left terrible things in there when they went out of business, but before anyone got a chance to learn what it was, someone bought up the property and started doing renovations. They mustve paid off whatever inspectors come around there, because the material theyve been sending us to burn has been nasty. Especially tonight.

Anyway, itll probably cost me my job if my boss knows how to use the Internet well enough to read this, but what I just saw worries the heck out of me. I loaded the biological and chemical waste into the incinerator and a few things happened: first, the fire burned so intensely that I worried the chimney would crack. Second, once the majority of the fire died down and main flames from the incinerator were the only heat source, the black smoke turned bright orange for about 30 seconds.

As soon as the smoke changed, every single fly in the place flew out of the room and up into the orange smoke. As it billowed out and the flies mixed in with it, their bodies must have burst because I saw drops blood raining down on the garbage and landfills below. The smoke turned black again and tapered off, but on the ground where the blood from all the flies rained, thick, heavy mushrooms sprouted almost immediately. Theres a swath as far as I can see covered in the things. Now every seagull around the place is going nuts and eating them. I think I see rats running toward them, too.

While this is all weird, just a minute ago, I started getting scared. One of the seagulls that mustve had its fill of mushrooms flew in my general direction. While I watched, excuse my language again, it shit on the ground. The moment it hit the dirt, more mushrooms sprouted. Thin, stringy ones. Ants are already swarming around it and taking pieces away.

I dont know whats happening here and it seems impossible that these things can grow so fast, but there are literally thousands of birds and countless bugs eating these mushrooms that just appeared out of blood and toxic smoke. That cant be good, right?

<TEXT> Im an administrator at a major hospital in the New York City area. Im not supposed to talk about this, but its so disconcerting that I believe more people need to know about it. Theres been an unexpected and inexplicable rise in the stockpile of blood. Its not only at our hospital, but in hospitals and blood banks all over the world. 

No one knows where its coming from and no one can seem to explain how it gets there. All the routine tests say its perfectly good and free from any pathogens and impurities. But the fact remains: no one knows whats going on.

You have to realize - hospitals and blood banks everywhere have always been low on blood. Its why there are blood drives and calls for donations and all that. The last few weeks, though, theres been so much that our hospital needed dispose of some because it expired before we had a chance to use it. As weird as this sounds, it gets worse.

This is the part Im worried will come back and bite me in the ass if any of the other administrators discover who I am. I signed a NDA explicitly stating I wouldnt talk about this. Still, I cant keep this quiet. When we dispose of blood, we do it in the incinerator with all the other medical waste. The fire burns so hot, pretty much everything evaporates and all thats left is inert ash. But this blood didnt evaporate. It did something way different.

A hospital maintenance worker was on the roof doing some unrelated work when smoke from the incinerator began exiting through the chimney. It looked normal for a while, but then the smoke tapered off and flies started pouring out. He told us they flew straight up for nearly two full minutes and hung above the roof like a cloud. After another minute, they fell like rain and burst open, covering the roof and the maintenance worker with the same blood wed tried to incinerate. We tried to incinerate more blood, this time with hospital administrators waiting on the roof. Same result.

Our administrators have spoken with the heads of other hospitals around the country. Theyve experienced similar issues. The blood banks are bursting with overstock and people everywhere are being given this blood that just appeared out of nowhere. 

The last thing Im going to mention is the patient we re-admitted last night. Hed been discharged a month ago following an operation which required multiple transfusions. Those transfusions were done with the mystery blood before anyone noticed its existence. His re-admission was due to a fire at his home. He came into the ER with 60% of his body covered in 3rd degree burns. While he was being worked on, flies erupted from underneath the burned flesh and dropped to the floor, exploding into thick droplets of blood.

The patient died soon after. The doctors and nurses were frightened and confused, but they dont know the whole story. But I guess they will soon. Please help me tell more people about whats going on. The blood just doesnt stop coming.

<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4hid0v/tiny_wet_footprints_1/)

The waterlogged carcass of the toddler disappeared around the corner. I bolted out of my chair and let out a yelp of fear and disgust. I ran to the other side of the security room where I could get a clear view of the hallway the child turned down. No child was there. Only tiny, wet footprints. 

The hair on my arms and neck and back stood erect while I loaded the footage of the nearest cameras into the DVR playback module. I could still hear the creatures howl in my mind; a howl mixed with the desperate gurgling that can only come from lungs frantically trying to expel water. 

The video screens showed me from different angles. Waves of murky light, as if filtered through water, illuminated the floor behind me. On screen, I saw myself whirl around in my chair. A shimmering, distorted blob of red and gray oil hung in the air in the same spot as the child had occupied. The blob shuddered and flowed within itself, creating bizarre shapes that made me nauseous just watching them. One end of the thing pinched into a point so small I couldnt even see it while the other part bloomed into something roughly cylindrical and concave. In the recording, the look of horror on my face brought a new wave of fear. Whatever I was seeing shouldnt have been there. None of it should have been there. 

The power went out. My scream echoed through the security room and bounced down the narrow hallways surrounding it. I scrambled in the dark for the flashlight on the far end of the console. While I fumbled around, I heard splashing. The sound was far away but unmistakable. I tried telling myself it was just the normal sound of the river meeting the dam, but it was little comfort. The sound of my ragged, panicked breathing accompanied the splashes.

My hands gripped the smooth body of the flashlight. I fingered the button on top, dreading the moment Id press it and be face-to-face with something horrible. I turned the flashlight on. The empty security room was bathed in the blue-white light of the heavy-duty flashlight. 

I wondered why the emergency lights hadnt gone on. Theyd activated countless times in recent weeks when the decommissioning crew had to turn off the main power for whatever reason. This time, though, there was nothing. Not even the exit signs worked. I walked as quietly as I could to the door and peeked out. The flashlight swept up and down the long, narrow corridor. I pulled my cell phone out of my pocket. The screen worked, but there was no service. This wasnt a surprise. With the amount of concrete and metal around me, Id never been able to get service in the plant.

The splashing continued. I pointed the beam of light at the floor in front of me and walked in the direction it was coming from. Whispers accompanied the splashing. At the time, I felt a bit of relief. There were other people working that night - guys from the decommissioning crew. They were in the turbine room and thats where the sounds were coming from. I picked up the pace of my walk a little, still wary and expecting something awful to pop out from any of the countless corners I passed on my way.

After a couple minutes, I reached the door that led to a catwalk which ran 70 feet above the turbine room. It was one of my favorite places during the day; from up there, you could see every part of the colossal room that contained the power generation equipment. With a sudden compulsion to be cautious, I turned off my flashlight and twisted the doorknob. I pushed it open as quietly as possible. The splashing and whispers stopped.

I tiptoed onto the catwalk, consumed by the pitch blackness of the giant room. I closed the door and walked out about ten feet. My throat was dry, and I choked out a weak, hello?

The word stopped dead in front of me as if I were in an anechoic chamber. Again, I said, hello? Nothing. No reply. I noticed I could hear my heart beating in my chest and heard the rush of blood in and around my ears. Every breath sounded as if it were passing through a thick mattress. I hit the side of the railing with the butt of my flashlight. The dull clunk sounded once, but never again. 

I made it to what I thought was the middle of the catwalk. I hadnt dared to turn on my flashlight. Part of me was scared Id see something terrible in front of me; another part was scared it wouldnt turn on at all. My mind started to race. There should be at least ten men working in there. And they never worked quietly. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, any visitor to the turbine room would be greeted by the swearing and farting of the workmen and the screeching and pounding of their tools. Now: nothing. 

My thumb caressed the protruding rubber button on the flashlight. I thought back to the slick, undulating shape picked up by the camera; the shape that presented itself to me as a drowned and mutilated child. I felt my teeth crunching down on the hard, calcified teeth of unknown children. I gasped and pressed the flashlight button.

The world consumed me. The blackness erupted into hazy, gray light. I was swept off my feet into a vortex of impossible strength. I was underwater. My arms and legs flailed against the current pulling me down. Nothing I could do was strong enough to fight the pull of the water. My lungs burned in my chest and my eardrums felt like they were being punctured. Scrambling uselessly, my arms and legs bumped up against little bundles in the current alongside me. No, not bundles.

My eyes, already wide with panic, could make out the shapes of children. They were young and small, no older than six or seven. Some left a trail of bright blood in their wake as it pumped from deep slits in their throats and groins. Those without mortal gashes also struggled against the current, their weak limbs even more useless than mine in the fight against the pull of water.

The strength of the current intensified and my body began to flip end over end. I was no longer fighting to free myself from the pull, but now the struggle was to stop myself from reflexively inhaling. I clamped my hands over my nose and mouth as I spun toward a massive wall in our path. It was the dam, I realized. And the turbines were on.

The smallest of the children flew by me with a trail of crimson marking its path. It reached the dam and struck the fence protecting the turbine blades from solid material that could damage it. I struck right after. As my vision dimmed and more of the children slammed into the barrier, I watched the suction of the turbine pull the tongue, esophagus, and stomach from the mouth of the first child who struck the fence. I felt immense pressure on my navel, and when I looked down, I realized loops of my intestines were being sucked out of me. As they burst from the pressure and their contents were pulled into the turbines, I gasped with one final expression of pain and panic. Water filled my lungs.

The button on the flashlight clicked in my hand and I stared up at the ceiling of the turbine room. I was on my back. I choked and coughed, rolling over onto my stomach and then hoisting myself onto my hands and knees as I vomited brackish water onto the floor. I looked around. The room was illuminated fully. The power had come back on. How Id gotten from the catwalk to the floor 70 feet below was anyones guess.

When I turned my head toward far end of the room, where the exit led to the long hallway and staircase down to the utility basement, I stopped breathing. Id found the decommissioning crew. Their bodies were disfigured beyond recognition. Their tattered uniforms were piled on the floor in a growing puddle of blood. I walked toward them tentatively, wondering why I wasnt running in the opposite direction. I moved as if impelled and the details of their wounds grew clear. 

Their chests and bellies and backsides were flayed open and pulled apart. Loops of bowels and glistening visceral fat hung like hideous decorations around their corpses, which were mounted or tied to the doorway to the utility basement by their own parts. The intense industrial lights of the turbine room cast a hideous sheen on the gore. 

Roger, the foreman, was the only one whose face hadnt been disfigured. His intestines had been forced from his mouth as if by some terrible suction and were torn to shreds. They leaked and dripped their filth into the puddle of blood below him and his crew. I looked away from Roger and glanced down at the awful puddle. 

It was dotted with tiny, bloody footprints.

<TEXT> Ive always been self-conscious about my thumb sucking problem. And it is a problem. Most kids either grow out of it or have the habit gently coaxed away by attentive parents or counselors. My upbringing was different, though. I never grew out of it. I never saw my parents for more than a couple hours every week. Theyd be so busy with work that the only people Id see on a regular basis were the servants and housekeepers. God knows they werent going to correct the habits of their employers only son. The heir to the family fortune.

Maybe if I had friends or family members around, I wouldve matured normally. That opportunity is long gone, though. I think my habit is a plea for security; having no real comfort or warmth in my life probably leads me to engage in such an infantile practice. Im 20 - way too old to be doing something as immature as thumb sucking, but here I am. I never expected anything to change for the better.

When my parents died in that car fire, I was the only one left. I was 15 years old, wealthy beyond my comprehension, and aside from the servants, the only one in a home that would be better referred to as a palace. The servants doted on me like theyd been taught to. My tutors came and left on schedule. No one dared to tell me to get a social life or interact with the world around me. They left me in peace with my laptop and video games. For all they knew - for all I knew - Id be browsing and playing alone until the day I died.

Like I said before, Im 20 now. Until recently, my life continued the way Id expected. Then I met Aria. Aria is the daughter of one of the servants. Shes younger than me, probably 16 or 17. But shes the first person who ever took interest in me on a personal level, rather than just going through the motions of servant-to-master interaction. When her mother, whose name I dont even know, found out, she was very angry with her daughter and apologized to me profusely. I was assured Aria wouldnt bother me again. I said it was okay. I allowed Aria to visit as frequently as she wished.

We quickly grew close, and it didnt take long before Aria brought up my habit. I was mortified. I didnt realize Id been doing it while she talked to me. I slid the wrinkled, saliva drenched thumb out of my mouth and clenched my fist around it in some halfhearted attempt to hide my shame. Aria told me not to be embarrassed. She took my hand in her own and gently unballed my fist. As I watched in disbelief, my heart pounding so powerfully I worried shed hear it, Aria took the still-wet thumb in her own mouth.

You have to realize something: Id never even hugged a person aside from my mother when I was a child. This was a level of intimacy Id never expected to see in person, let alone participate in. I shuddered with nervous excitement. Aria stopped what she was doing and asked if I was okay. I nodded and told her I just needed to get some air. I left her on the couch.

I stood on the balcony and gazed at the city below. I realized it was the first time Id been outside in months. While the fresh air loosened my tension and helped clear my head, I felt Aria come up behind me and wrap an arm around my waist. I jumped a little at the contact.

Shhh, Aria told me. Its okay. She knew I was nervous, but the feeling was dissipating. I felt comfortable with her. Comfortable enough to engage in my habit without feeling like a baby.

I brought my hand to my mouth. My head spun when I tasted the remains of her saliva on the wrinkled digit. I sucked with purpose, wanting to swallow what had been inside her mere minutes ago. I sucked harder. I felt the nail come off and stick to the roof of my mouth but I didnt care. My tongue sought out the virgin flesh underneath. Aria turned me around to face her, and our eyes locked.

Please let me help you, she whispered. Before I could oblige, the door opened on the other side of the room. A servant came in, pushing a cart with a tray on it. She kept her head down, apologizing for interrupting me.

Im sorry sir, she muttered, but perhaps youd prefer a fresh one? The servant removed the cloche from the tray and revealed 10 severed thumbs, neatly arranged in order of skin color. I dragged the old thumb from my mouth. Id used it for over a day and the skin was beginning to slough from the bone. Aria looked at the tray with excitement. Can we share these?, she asked. I grinned at her, then noticed the bandage on the servants left hand. She quickly hid it behind her back.

We had trouble finding a tenth one, sir, the servant informed me. Im sorry, truly, if mine is not good enough.

Which one is it?, I asked. She pointed to the third one from the end. I picked it up and handed it to Aria. She looked at it for a moment, then slid it into her mouth. Her lips formed a smile around the dark digit.

I dismissed the servant. Aria and I stood on the balcony, quietly sucking our thumbs. I felt her hand wrap around mine and she leaned her head against my shoulder. I beamed with happiness. Finally, a chance to live a normal life.

<TEXT> I know its probably silly to ask but since theres a lot of people here maybe someone knows whats up? Im Madison, btw.

But yeah Gina (thats my sister) is 11 and we just had a fight because she has a boyfriend and I told her she has to wait to have a boyfriend because I had to wait til I was 12 to have a boyfriend but I STILL dont even have a boyfriend so she DEFINITELY cant have a boyfriend. You know what I mean? Anyway we were yelling and then she stopped and made these sounds like she couldnt breathe too good. She was fine after a couple minutes but now shes just being weird.

I know I could call Mom and Dad but theyre away for the weekend. Mom finally let me babysit for Gina so Im super worried shell get mad if Gina does something dumb like shes doing now. Thats why Im asking you nice people for help! :) 

So anyway yeah Ginas just staring at the ceiling. Like, totally staring. She hasnt moved or anything and shes standing in the middle of the living room like a dumb totem pole lol. I know thats mean and Mom says I shouldnt call her that just cause shes tall. But you can call her that if you want haha. Yeah shes staring at the ceiling. 

Just a couple minutes ago I told her I was sick of playing her dumb little kids game and tried to get her to move out of the living room. She didnt budge. I know shes tall for her age but shes not heavy at all but I couldnt move Gina even a little. I know I shouldnt have but I started yelling at her again and called her a bunch of names and then I hit her but she still wouldnt move.

That kinda scared me a little and its when I got the idea to ask you guys online. Im in the living room typing on my phone so I can watch Gina while shes still doing the same bullstuff. Like, I dont know if she got cut with a nail and got lockjaw all over her body or something but now while Im saying all this shes making noises. Maybe thats a good thing?

Hmm yeah Gina wont shut up now and keeps saying weird stuff like God and faces and how the inside of faces taste like faces. Kinda gross right? Now shes saying my name over and over and over. I HATE IT WHEN SHE SAYS MY NAME A LOT!!

Well I hit Gina again because Im so mad at her for making me miss my tv show because Im dealing with all this little girl garbage shes doing. I know this is why Mom and Dad like me better. Especially Dad. I bet he wouldnt care if Gina even died lol. No maybe hed probably care a little.

Oh my God Gina will not shut up! Oh weird she just shut up lol. Shes crying hahah. I bet she finally noticed how mad she made me. But theres something wrong with her tears they look almost yellow and sometimes darker. Theyre thick too. Im gonna go look closer.

Ew God they smell so gross and theyre all thick and pasty and I can hear them squeezing out of her gross eyes and shes saying something about the taste of faces again. Anyway Im going to post this online for you guys and you can tell me whats wrong with her. Ill let you know if anything else weird happens! Thx!

<TEXT> Back in the 80s, the electric company shut down part of the hydro plant and sent a diver down to see why the water pressure was so low near turbine two. We all know what happened after that. The drowned bodies of 28 children were found mashed up against the fence protecting the intake. The diver blew his brains out the next day. 

Its over 30 years later and none of those kids have been identified. No reports of missing children from back then could be linked to any of the bodies, either. Its like the kids were hidden for their entire, short lives before they were killed. I can think of a lot of awful ways to die, and being sucked into a hydroelectric dam intake is near the top of that list. The autopsies found water in their lungs, so they were alive when they got pulled under. Its bad enough to think of one kid struggling against the current trying to suck him into the turbines. 28 of them dying like that is just incomprehensible. 

In late 2015, the electric company began decommissioning the hydro plant. Itd served well for 50 years, but the nuclear facility in Brandon County finally went online and its cheaper to buy power from them than it is to keep this old plant running. I oversee a small crew of security workers who make sure no one comes into the place to steal copper and other potentially-valuable material from the site. 

A couple weeks ago, Jorge came to me looking a little concerned. Jorges the guy who monitors the security cameras. He told me that overnight, around 3am, the cameras picked up something in the massive room that houses the turbines. When I reviewed the DVR with him, I got the same feeling of unease. The resolution of the cameras isnt too great, especially in such a dark room, but I saw what Jorge saw: a line of water on the floor moving from one end of the room to the other. 

Later on in the morning, we asked a couple guys who were on the decommissioning crew to check for leaks in the floor and ceiling. There were no leaks whatsoever. I told Jorge to keep quiet about what we saw; the last thing I needed was for my guys to start doing stupid things because they were scared of something that was probably just an optical illusion or a camera trick. He agreed to not say anything.

Paul, one of the security guards, came to me the next day. He was scared out of his mind. I never really liked Paul. Its not that he was a bad worker; he was quite good, actually. There was just something about his personality that irked me. Too macho. Fake alpha-male bullshit. But there was nothing macho about him on that day. It looked like hed been crying. When he told me about what happened during one of his patrols, he clutched the cross around his neck with so hard his knuckles were white.

It started off like whispering, he told me. Like, I couldnt tell what they were saying or anything, but you know when a crowds talking and you hear voices but dont know what people are talking about? It was like that, but whispers. Kids whispers.

Normally, this type of thing wouldnt bother me much. But coming off the night before with the weird shit Jorge and I saw on tape, I started to feel scared. I did my best not to show it.

Ok, so you heard whispers, I said. It was probably the overnight guys working and their voices echoing or something.

Paul looked thoughtful for a minute. Maybe, yeah. He bent down and started to untie his shoelace. But I just dont know how this happened.

He took off the shoe and peeled off his sock. All the toes were raw and red, like hed caught a terrible case of athletes foot. To make matters worse, it looked like the nails were coming off. I winced.

I was fine before I heard all that stuff, Paul informed me. I could see him shaking a little. The other foots just as bad.

I didnt really know what to tell the guy, so I sent him home and excused him for the next night. I told him to get his feet checked out and come back the following Monday. 

That night, I told Jorge I was going to work on some stuff and if he wanted to go home to his wife, he could. I knew hed take the opportunity without question, and he did. I was alone in the security office with the 33 monitors that showed the entire power plant.

Before Paul had left, I asked him where he was when he heard the voices. He told me he was on the utility floor - one of the lowest levels of the plant. I stifled a shudder when I thought of that area. It was remote, dark, and flat-out scary. All pipes, huge machines, and countless barrels and tanks. 

I backed the DVR up to the moment Paul walked out of the stairwell and onto the utility floor. As soon as he entered, he cocked his head like he heard something. He stood still for a minute, then he walked forward down the corridor. I saw him move in and out of the various cameras views. Every so often, hed stop and cock his head again. I felt a chill and goosebumps rose on my arms and neck. I grabbed a handful of the peanut M Ms that counted as my dinner. 

While I chewed the candies, I saw Paul stop dead in his tracks and whirl around. I saw his eyes go wide as he scanned around him for whatever he was hearing. He glanced up at the pipes over his head. As he looked, I saw a puddle form under his feet. It materialized out of nowhere on solid concrete and soaked his shoes all the way up to his ankles. When he looked back down, the puddle disappeared as quickly as it came. He never got a chance to see it.

Again, Paul whirled around. And again. This last time, he started running for the stairwell. I gasped. Behind Paul, leaving a trail that chased him as he ran, were small footprints. I punched the stop button on the DVR and flipped one of the screens onto regular TV. The sound of the Food Network filled the security room. I worked to calm down and tried telling myself there was nothing to be scared of. Just something Paul mustve stepped in that he was tracking all over the place. 

I leaned back in my chair while Bobby Flay demonstrated how to get the proper grill marks on a piece of fish. My breathing normalized and I shook off the last of the goosebumps that dotted my forearms. I threw back another handful of M Ms. The moment I bit down, my mouth erupted with searing pain. I gagged and spit the candies out over the DVR console. I stared in terror at what was just inside my mouth. Between the buttons and keyboard keys were tiny, graying baby teeth.

I retched with disgust and horror. I poured the contents of the candy bag out onto the console. Tens of little teeth clicked and clattered as they spilled out. While my tongue poked around in my mouth and I tried to determine how many of my own teeth were damaged, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I turned in my chair. Standing in the doorway was a small, hideously decayed child. The hallway light shone on its naked body. Fat, sightless eyes bulged out of its skull and its wide, toothless mouth lolled down to its sternum.

My body wouldnt to listen to my commands. I wanted to yell. I wanted to run and throw something at the thing. But I couldnt; I was rooted to the chair and unable to do anything but watch. The child waddled two steps toward me. From the back of its its throat, it let out a weak, gurgling scream. Then it turned around, its swollen skin sliding around on its delicate bones as it moved, and walked away, leaving tiny, wet footprints in its wake.

<TEXT> Show of hands: who actually likes wearing condoms? Exactly. Theyre the worst. Theyre uncomfortable, they destroy all feeling, and if you actually manage to complete the act without deflating like one of Tom Bradys footballs, you have to waddle over to the bathroom to throw the thing away while it hangs off you like an eating-disordered grub. But you know what? We still wear them. Because were civilized people. 

Heres the thing: fuck being civilized. Im not going near one of those latex pieces of shit for as long as I live. As if everything I said above wasnt enough, I had to deal with what happened last night. God knows if Ill ever be able to have sex again.

Id only been on one date with Aimee before yesterday, but it was obvious there was a lot of chemistry between us. So, after we had dinner last night, things went their natural way. Thats a nice way of saying we were grunting and sweating all over one another in the cab on the way back to my apartment. I tipped the driver extra.

We made it back to my place and continued the various biological manipulations wed started in the taxi. Added bonus to being at home: less clothing. Anyway, things progressed as wed both anticipated, and a little while later, she was asking me to get a condom. Who was I to deny the lovely woman what shed asked? I reached over and grabbed one from the nightstand. Aimee took it from me and tore off the wrapper. She looked like she was considering the options for a moment, then she leaned over and put the condom back on the nightstand and did something else to me for a little while. Something quite nice, I might add.

About nine seconds later, I had her stop. I knew the date would end pretty damn early if I let her continue. Aimee obliged, then she repositioned herself to the edge of the bed. Even I could figure out what that meant. I got up, grabbed the condom from the nightstand, rolled the thing over my stupid dick, and we went to work. This time, it was for about four seconds.

In that fourth second, something pinched the tip of my penis. Hard. I withdrew faster than the Republican Guard after the fall of Baghdad. I yelped as I pulled out. I heard Aimee mutter, oh my fucking God, really? I wasnt particularly concerned with her annoyance, though. There was an intensely sharp pain directly at the entrance to my urethra. Something hard was inside the condom, no pun intended, and, I realized with growing horror, it was moving. My yelps turned into a sustained shriek as I peeled the condom off while pinching the tip and feeling something wriggling under my fingertips. 

Whatever I was pinching crunched between my thumb and forefinger. Once Id been freed from the condom, I saw what it was: one of the house centipedes the apartment would get whenever it rained outside. Do you know what house centipedes are? [Theyre these things.](http://imgur.com/SzwHzrp) And there was one up my dick. And Id broken it in half. The other piece, which still moved, was lodged firmly inside my urethra. I screamed and screamed and when Aimee turned around and saw what the commotion was, she made a sound I was certain would wake up the entire apartment complex.

I pinched the halved insect and tried to pull it out of me. Again, its crunchy body broke off in my fingers. I wanted to die. The piece that was still stuck in me - the piece that was STILL MOVING - was getting further inside my penis the longer I stood there. 

And then something happened. Its something I never expected and its something I still dont believe could ever occur in real life. But it did. And the world has to know. Still, before I mention it, I need to say that the ordeal ended about 15 seconds later. Aimee left and I went to the hospital to get checked out. The nurses laughed and the doctors looked disapprovingly at the nurses before turning around and shaking with laughter themselves. I was given a clean bill of health and told to make sure nothing crawls into my condom the next time I have sex. It was nice of them to give their medical opinion.

The part I left out, though, was when Aimee demonstrated the true nature of her character. Even though I never expect to see her again, I will be forever in love with that woman. Its because in a time of great stress - in a time when a man is suffering and theres only the act of a great person that can save him - someone will step up and do what needs to be done. Aimee was that person last night. 

In the throes of my misery and pain as I flailed with terror and confusion to get the remaining fraction of the centipede out of my dick, Aimee put her hands on my shoulders. She stared at me; the light of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives from the television casting an angelic glow on her dark skin. Then she uttered words that will both haunt and enrich my memories for the remaining years of my life: 

Stop moving around so much. She let out a long sigh of abject resignation. 

I can probably suck it out.

<TEXT> **January 3, 2016**

My son will NOT - I repeat: WILL NOT be getting any more vaccines. I was ignorant about how bad they were for the first four years and I never told the doctors to leave him alone. Well, thank God he got lucky and seems fine, despite that. I got my eyes open now. Sandra Barkers child got poked with all those needles and shot through with nasty chemicals and guess what? Her poor little Eva ended up half retarded. A damn shame for Sandra and her little girl. Sorry big pharma, you cant have my Thomas. No way in hell. And Im going to tell the doctor that at his checkup tomorrow.

**January 4, 2016**

Doctors just make me sick. Funny, huh? Like its the opposite of what they say theyre gonna do. Thomas doctor is so rude and pushy. He has the nerve to think he knows whats better for my son than I do. Me. His mother. The strong woman who gave birth to him. You know, because he went to some fancy college in New York and got a piece of paper saying he can look at sick children. 

By the way, his name is Dr. Rav Mati and his practice is in Alfonse Creek, West Virginia. Dont even think about going to him with your own boy or girl. All hell do is try to push vaccines on them and gets fresh when you tell him to prove the shots wont make the kids sick. The man even said theres a shot for chickenpox now. Chickenpox! Those pharma fat cats will take every dollar youve got. I guess they dont think us parents were taught by our own moms about how to deal with chickenpox. A child has to catch it if they want to get strong! I think Earl has a point when he said those companies are trying to make kids grow up weak so theyll vote liberal. Theres no other explanation I can think of. I married a smart man.

**January 7th, 2016**

As luck would have it, Sandra Barkers poor retarded girl got chickenpox at the special daycare she has to go to. When Sandra called me up, I was relieved. After dealing with that stupid Dr. Mati the other day, Id started to worry Thomas wouldnt get to be around other kids who had it if their parents had been duped into getting them vaccinated. The last thing I wanted was for Thomas to be weak. God forbid he ended up that way and Earl found out he was a homosexual. Im not even going to think about that. No need to do that to myself.

Anyway, Sandra and I set up a playdate for Thomas and Sandras little Eva. Well go over tomorrow at lunchtime so I can be back to cook dinner in the afternoon. 

**January 8th, 2016**

Thomas seemed to have fun with little Eva. It breaks my heart to see that little girl, though. She just doesnt know whats going on half the time. Thomas was a good boy, though, and was very gentle and shared his toys. Sandra suggested we let them share a spoon and bowl when they ate their lunch so hed get a better chance of catching her chickenpox. So they shared their chicken soup and Sandra and I talked for a while. Thomas and I went home around 3:30. Perfect timing to get dinner started.

**January 11th, 2016**

Earl was grumpy this morning when he left for his business trip. He was hollering and complaining about one thing or another, but then he left and things were quiet again. I bet his job is more stressful than I know. Hell, this trip will keep him away from home for three weeks. I wish I told him I was sorry before he went, though. I always feel bad when I feel like I put him in one of his moods.

On a good note, Thomas started to get a fever and he said he was itchy. When I gave him his bath at night, I saw the little dots of chickenpox starting to show up. I called up Sandra to thank her and asked how Eva was doing. Sandra said Eva had it bad but no worse than her cousin Duane did a couple years ago. I got a little sad that Thomas would be so uncomfortable soon, but it was worth it in the long run. Hed be good and strong.

**January 12th, 2016**

Its amazing how fast chickenpox shows up! Thomas went to bed with little pinprick dots and woke up with big blotches the size of pepperoni slices. Hes scratching them like crazy and I keep slapping his hands so he wont cut himself with his fingernails. I cant stop thinking about all the poor kids whose parents were so ignorant about how the world works that they listened to Dr. Mati and all the other doctors like him. All the doctors lining their pockets with big pharma money so they can donate it to the democrats and whoever else hates families. Well, theyll see. Its families like ours who get strong and survive.

**January 13th, 2016**

Thomas started getting blisters on his palms. I dont think theyre from chickenpox, but the nice ladies on the homeschool forum I started visiting last year said it was probably just from his fever. Once his fever goes down, theyll go away. And if they got any worse, it would just have to run its course. Hes young and hell heal up good enough.

As mean as this sounds, Im a little glad the blisters seem to hurt because it stops Thomas from scratching. Didnt stop him from complaining, though! Not one bit. But its okay. I can take it! This is mom territory - we live to deal with kids complaining.

**January 14th, 2016**

Thomas is COVERED with chickenpox. Even when I part his hair, I see them on his scalp. Some of the older ones started to get big whiteheads on them. The one on the tip of his nose looks so uncomfortable, the poor kid. I remember having pimples when I was a teenager. These pox are like five times bigger. Maybe later on tonight Ill squeeze a few of them to help take some of the pressure off.

**January 15th, 2016**

In the bath last night, I popped about 20 of Thomas riper chickenpox. I squeezed and squeezed and that gunk just plopped down into the water. I had to mash it up with a wire brush before it would all get down the drain. Nasty nasty nasty! But still, its natural. So much more natural than whatever the doctor wouldve pumped into him.

The pox I squeezed dry just look like holes now. Theyre pretty swollen but he said they dont itch anymore. The holes are about as wide as a dime. I put Neosporin on them just so they wouldnt get infected and Im changing his bedsheets every night. I might be being a little overprotective, but hey, Im a mom. Its what moms do. Well, the good ones at least.

**January 16th, 2016**

I squeezed out more and more of those chickenpox last night. The ones Id squeezed the night before didnt fill up again, at least. Poor Thomas looks so ragged. Its like hes covered in little, swollen volcanos. At least this is running its course and itll be over in another few days. 

Im a tiny bit worried about the fever blisters on his hands and feet. My camera in my phones still busted, but I went online and [found a picture](http://imgur.com/mmYISca) thats pretty similar. Obviously this persons hand is much bigger than Thomas, but the look is the same. True to what the homeschool ladies said, he was still running a fever. 102 on the nose. Once that goes down, his hands will heal up and hell be good as new.

**January 17th, 2016**

Thomas woke me up this morning! He hasnt done that since he would cry and yell when he was a tiny baby. But he was standing next to my bed and saying that his body hurts. Well, I took one look at him and saw why. The poor boys chickenpox looked worse than any chickenpox Id ever seen. Ill admit it - I got pretty scared. His entire body - all his skin - was just filled up with holes. It looked like the remaining whiteheads had popped when he was asleep because he was all smeared with it. 

I brought him into the bath and rinsed him off. The water seemed to help him feel a little better, so I let him soak in the tub while I sat next to him in a chair with my laptop. I asked online if chickenpox were supposed to get so bad. One of the homeschool ladies asked if hed been vaccinated. I was super embarrassed when I told her he got all his shots up until this year because I didnt know any better. I felt awful admitting that to these smart people. But they were so kind and understanding. Then I was told what Id assumed but didnt want to take for granted: his case of chickenpox is worse because of the vaccines he got as a baby. Something about mercury poisoning and his body using the chickenpox as an opportunity to cleanse the toxins from his body.

While Thomas splashed around and I talked to the ladies online, I felt a lot better. By this time next week, hed be healing up like nothing had happened.

**January 18th, 2016**

Thomas looked just as bad this morning. He asked right away if he could take a bath, so we did what we did yesterday. I paid more attention to his skin this time. I dont know exactly how to describe him. Maybe the inside of a wasp nest? Hes just so covered with holes that I can barely make out any skin that isnt part of a crater, especially now that hes in the water and his skin is swelling.

Im just so mad at all the doctors and corporations who put those chemicals into Thomas when he was a baby. Im mad at myself for listening to them. Like I was just following orders like some damn Nazi. Because thats what those big pharma liberals are, you know. Theres a reason socialist is in national socialist. Of course you know. And this countrys going down the tubes because of it. And Thomas is suffering in that bathtub for the same damn reason. 

**January 19th, 2016**

Im about to go ask the ladies on the homeschool forum for some help because I just went to wake Thomas and all his holes are leaking. Theres yellow stuff coming out of them and a tiny black hard thing is poking out of each one. Its like a pebble or a seed or something godawful. When he opened his eyes, I could see more holes starting to form in the corners where his tears come out. He said he could see me but I looked like I was underwater.

I carried him to the bathroom so he could do his business, and when he sat down on the toilet, some holes in his thighs split and the stuff inside, the yellow gunk and the hard pebble piece, bulged out. He looked at me like he was scared and started to pick at it. His finger slid all the way inside. 

Theres no way Im going to the doctor wholl just inject him with more stuff to make this even worse, but Im concerned his chickenpox might be getting infected. I guess its time to go ask online. The ladies from the homeschool forum have been so helpful already. Its great to be able to rely on the wisdom of moms.

<TITLE> Soft Teeth </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-26 16:20:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember the man with the soft teeth. Hed come into my room at night and bite me over and over. The bites didnt hurt and they left no marks. All I felt was pressure. 

The first time I saw his face, I was terrified. His eyes were different. Instead of two eye sockets, he had nine. They were clustered in front of his face and up his forehead like a honeycomb. Two on top, four in the middle, three on the bottom. The sockets didnt house eyeballs. There was a single, thin eyestalk growing from the center of each hole. Each stalk swayed in front of his face like long grass in the breeze.

When hed visit me, Id lose the ability to move or scream. All I could do was watch. After a week of visits and my parents not believing a word that came out of my mouth, I thought sleeping with the light on might keep him away. That was the night he started biting my face.

The man would always move slowly and with great care. Every motion seemed calculated and precise; I didnt know what he was doing, but I had no doubt he did. The first time he got close to my head, I saw the inside of his mouth. Like his eyes, his teeth were unlike any Id seen. There were three rows of bulbous growths pushing from an array of holes in his gumline. They looked as soft as they felt. Each one was covered in fine, downy hairs. They reminded me of the fat bodies of moths.

Hed open my mouth with his index finger and thumb. Then hed get close. I felt his eyestalks brushing against my face and forehead and eyes as he pressed his upper teeth against my lower ones. Hed close his mouth around my chin, locking my lower jaw in his mouth. It was uncomfortable, but it didnt hurt. The man would stay there for ten minutes at a time, gradually modulating the pressure of his jaw against mine.

On the last night he visited me, he performed the same steps. Once my jaw was in his mouth, though, he applied more pressure than hed used in the past. His eyestalks straightened out and felt like firm cables against my face. As the pressure increased, I felt his teeth start to burst against my own. One by one, the thick, insectile bodies inside his mouth succumbed to the pressure and coated my tongue and gums with thick, bitter paste. I felt his tongue, which had never been involved in our interactions before, extending over my teeth and massaging the paste into my gums. I tried to retch, but even that had been taken from me.

The man did the same with my upper teeth and palate. When he left and I could move again, I rushed to the bathroom, threw up, and brushed my teeth more times than I could count. I never saw the man again.

Its been 25 years. Ive been plagued by dental issues my entire adult life. Every visit brings worse news; its gotten to the point where Im dealing with irreversible bone loss. Eventually, my teeth will fall out. The foundation to which theyre attached is simply deteriorating. Its not uncommon, but its rare for someone my age who is otherwise in perfect health.

As if on cue, the day after my most recent trip to the dentist, I lost my first tooth. Id felt it loosening and the dentist said it was only a matter of time. And more will follow. I scheduled an appointment to see him in three months. It was as frequently as my insurance would allow. More of my teeth started to wiggle when I poked at them with my tongue. I started to accept their fate.

Recently, my resignation has developed flickers of fear and disbelief. The tooth that fell out started to grow back. Id never heard of such a thing. But I can see something grayish-white pushing through the raw socket. When I touch it with my tongue, its soft. And I can feel my tongue brushing against it, almost as if it has nerves of its own. Im trying not to think back to the memories of the man in my room, but its impossible not to. Not when more of my teeth grow looser by the day. And especially not when I have seven painful spots near my eyes and forehead that feel softer than they should.

<TEXT> Jaimes car accident nearly killed him. His coma lasted eight weeks. When he regained consciousness, he couldnt recognize me and Inez. Prosopagnosia - face blindness - was the diagnosis. The doctors wouldnt give us any answers about whether or not hed get better. They just said wed have to wait and see. Jaime could remember who we were; he knew he had a wife named Carla and a daughter named Inez, but whenever we walked into the room, he saw two strangers.

Over time, he started to recover. The recovery wasnt total. Not even close. Hed jump with shock and surprise if Inez came into the room too quickly and didnt leave him enough time to remember it was her. Last month, when Jaime and I were in the shower, I washed his hair and shoulders and back, but when he turned around, he yelped and tried to get away. He slipped and almost cracked his head on the faucet.

The therapist suggested Jaime carry and study a photograph of Inez and me as frequently as possible. The goal was for his damaged brain to hopefully remap the features hed lost the ability to retain. After a couple months, we saw some major improvements. Still far from perfect, but much, much better. The frightened, jumpy person he became after the accident slowly started to resemble the strong, protective man Id married.

Last night, I was jolted awake by the sound of Jaime shrieking. He wasnt in bed. The sound came from down the hall. From Inezs room. I jumped out of bed and ran to see what was wrong. Jaime met me halfway. His hands were covered in blood.

Its wearing her face!, he screamed. He gripped my shoulders and studied my features with his wide, terrified eyes. It stole her face!

I struggled out of his grasp as Jaime sunk to the floor and called after me. Find Inez!, he choked out. Please. He sobbed as I turned the corner into our Inezs room.

Gaping holes that once housed eyes oozed blood down pale cheeks. Those same eyes were now forced deep into the skull by the panicked violence of my husband. As I screamed with incomprehensible horror, Jaime came up behind me and bellowed, get away from it! Find Inez!

Jaime tore through Inezs closet with the picture of Inez and me in his hand, frantically scanning everything inside for the girl who matched the appearance of his daughter in the photograph. My breath caught in my throat. In the picture Jaime studied to memorize the faces of his family, I was sitting behind Inez and brushing her long, black hair.

What are you doing?, he screamed at me. Help me find her!

Sobbing, I collapsed on the bed and cradled the cooling body on the blood-soaked Steven Universe sheets. After Jaime had gone to sleep, Id finally given in to Inezs nagging. Instead of the luxurious, flowing hair in the picture, Inez went to bed with her new, short, pixie-style haircut.

<TEXT> George saw the expression of horror on my face from halfway across the yard. Even before I started yelling for help, he was on his way toward me. Through my shallow, ragged breaths of panic, I choked out, shes in the well!

My neighbor was galvanized into action. He practically carried me to his pickup and we peeled out of the driveway toward his barn. George slammed the parking brake down while we were still moving. The truck screeched to a halt and George ran into the barn. He came back ten seconds later with a long, extendable ladder. He threw it in the back of the pickup, cracking the glass on the rear window of the cab with the force of his throw. Without even a hint of concern for the window, he jumped back in the truck and we tore through the field separating our yards until we reached the old well on the edge of my property.

For Mias entire childhood, Dave and I warned her to stay away from the well. When she was a kid, she listened. Once she hit ten, though, she got a rebellious streak in her. It only got worse in the aftermath of Daves passing. Without her dad around and with me being at work so often, shed always find her way into some trouble. George did his best to keep an eye on the house from across the way, but he couldnt watch it all the time. Nor should he have to. But he remembered when he had to tell his own kids to stay away from our well. The thing is a deathtrap, even with the boards Dave had put over its opening.

She hasnt answered me, I sobbed. Wed just gotten to the well and George was using his flashlight to peer into its stygian depths. The boards that had covered the opening were stacked neatly against the side. George yelled her name into the blackness. His deep voice echoed off the narrow walls and came back to the top a few seconds later as a weak shadow of its former self. Not a sound was heard from the bottom. 

George could see I was starting to lose it. My shivers had turned into full-blown shudders. My knees were knocking together so hard I could barely stand. I leaned against the pickup for support. 

Shes going to die, I gasped. Mias going to be dead. Dead like Dave and Ill be alone.

The world desaturated and dimmed as I hyperventilated. For a second, I must have blacked out because I wasnt standing anymore. I sat cross-legged in the dirt as George struggled to put the ladder into the opening of the well. He called Mias name over and over and over as he worked to get the thing inside. It struck me that George loved my daughter. It made sense; hed babysat her whenever I needed to work. Even after his own kids were grown and had moved away, George took interest in Mia and did his best to give her turbulent life a modicum of stability. 

I heard George swear under his breath once he realized the ladder wasnt long enough to reach the bottom. He yelled, Mia, look out! and he dropped the ladder. I struggled to my feet and peered over the edge; my tears falling into the blackness. I could see the top of the ladder was only about ten feet from the lip of the well. George rushed to the bed of his pickup and grabbed a rope. He tied it to the bumper of the truck and was ready to rappel down to the ladder.

How long until the fire department gets here?, he asked. 

I called them two minutes before I came to you, I whimpered. Itll be at least another 15 before theyre here.

Before jumping over the edge, George told me, When I have her in my arms, I wont be able to get back up the rope. Theyll need to get us both out. With that, he lowered himself down to the ladder.

Once he had his feet on the rungs, he let go of the rope and navigated down the narrow throat of the well. He peered up at my tearstained face as he descended. Shell be okay, he told me. His voice was firm. Confident.

George reached the bottom a minute or two later. He yelled up to me, his voice still calm and steady but with a hint of worry thatd been absent moments ago. Im looking. Ill find her.

I glanced over my shoulder and saw dust being kicked up on the dirt road way on the other side of the property. Dave always hoped hed get an opportunity to pave the damn thing, but he never got a chance. The only benefit was it was easy to see when someone was coming. 

The ladder shuddered as George made his way up. His face emerged from the blackness. I...I cant find Mia, he admitted. The calmness that had defined his voice this whole time was gone. He sounded resigned. It almost sounded like hed failed.

I heard tires screech to a halt behind me. I whirled around and shouted, Its about time!

Im so, so sorry Mom!, Mia exclaimed. She got off her bicycle and let it drop in the dirt. She was panting and sweat poured down her face. Did I miss it?

Mia and I peered over the edge of the well. George, whod made his way to the top of the ladder and was reaching for the rope, stopped and stared up with bewilderment.

Mia?, he asked, a look of confusion blooming on his brow.

Hi Mr. Palumbo!, Mia shouted.

George reached for the rope and tried to pull himself up. Its end whipped over the edge of the well and slapped him in the forehead. Id untied it from his bumper the minute hed set foot on the ladder. 

Whats going on?, asked George. He sounded angry now. Indignant. What are - . He stopped talking. A deep, droning sound came from below him. Even though it wasnt loud, I could feel its low frequency resonating in my chest. 

He peered down. Mia glanced at me and smiled. I put my arm around her sweaty shoulders. We watched George together. The noise came again. It was louder this time. Almost too loud. I felt it in my chest and deep in my stomach, giving me the unpleasant sensation of needing to rush to the bathroom. Mia squirmed with discomfort. The stones lining the inside of the well began to leak. George yelped with surprise. The fluid was thick and viscous. It started dark - almost black. As more vomited out from between the stones and dripped into the pit of the well, its color lightened. Crimson liquid mixed with swirls of beige paste and yellow, mucousy discharge. The smell made my head spin. From the corner of my eye, I saw Mia quietly retching.

George yelled again. And again. More fluid spurted from the walls, soaking George. His yell turned into a high-pitched, uncomprehending scream. His clothing dissolved. The mop of gray hair on his head began to smoke. Steam rose from his skin. He gripped the top rung of the ladder in some desperate bid for security.

The walls stopped their ejaculation. George stared at us with a look of desperate pain and abject terror. The droning sound from earlier was replaced by an intense, distorted blast. The ladder shuddered below George as the amplitude of the noise increased. My breath felt stuck in my chest. It was so, so loud. My ribs felt like they were being trampled on and my bowels contorted and spasmed. Mia doubled over and fell backward, clutching her knees to her chest as her nose dripped blood onto her t-shirt. 

When it felt like my body would pop from the intensity of the sound, it stopped. Come on, get up, I hissed at Mia. She obeyed, wiping her nose with her forearm and pulling her shirt down over the back of her shorts with embarrassment. George was silent. He wasnt looking at us anymore. He was staring at the bottom of the well. Then he gasped.

Our God coalesced from the putrescent slime and crept up the sides of the well like ivy carved from rotten meat. A thick tube, about as wide as Georges trunk, rose silently from the depths. George scrambled up the ladder, bracing his hands on the slippery stone. Steam billowed from the spots where his hands met the walls, still wet with caustic fluid. He didnt seem to notice. He dug his fingers into the stone and I cringed when his fingernails snapped backward with audible pops. Our God was at him in seconds. 

The column had enveloped the ladder and was at Georges feet. Cilia slid from the tip of the tube and grasped each ankle. As he was pulled downward, he reached up toward us. Mia waved. A terrible sucking sound exploded from the well. Georges legs disappeared into Our God. The color drained from his body and his eyes collapsed backward into his skull. After a loud crack, the top of his head caved inward. Mia and I stared into the hole in his head. Soft, wet slurping sounds burbled up from the wreckage of my neighbors body.

I looked away from George and watched Mia. She gazed at Our God with rapt attention. Her nose had clotted and she gripped the edge of the well with white knuckles. The embarrassment shed felt a brief time ago was long forgotten. This was what shed wanted to see. This was what Dave and I had told her about since she was a toddler. 

Once Our God had finished and disappeared back into the well, Mia looked into my eyes. She was weeping. 

Are you okay?, I asked, genuinely concerned.

I love you, Mom, was all she said. We embraced for a long, long time. 

Today, with Mia all grown up and my beautiful grandchildren running around the house causing all sorts of trouble, I look back at that embrace as the first time my daughter and I truly connected. Sometimes it just takes a special situation for two people to realize how close they are. For that situation - for that wonderful, memorable moment - I give great thanks to Our God. 

May every word I speak be in praise of His drooling mouths; may all my pleasure be felt by His singing flesh; may my last day on Earth be the day He chooses to taste me. Through His grace, I will bathe in His tongues.

<TEXT> You know that interactive meme site that takes pics with your webcam and makes captions at the top and bottom of the image? My girlfriend showed it to me the other day. We were pretty impressed by how well the software picks up on facial expressions and makes captions based on what the algorithm detects. Anyway, we played around with it for a while, got bored, and then watched some Frasier reruns.

Last night, when I was home alone with nothing to do, I clicked over to that site again to see what kinds of captions I could get it to come up with. For a while, it was no different from the other day. Right when I thought Id had enough and was ready to head out and get something to eat, the page refreshed and a new button appeared. Live caption. I clicked it. My webcam light turned on and my familiar, stupid face appeared. Every five seconds, a still-frame was captured. Like before, it was captioned. 

I let it caption me for a few minutes and I watched the picture pool fill with thumbnails of all the captured images. I was a little disappointed. All live caption seemed to do was take away the need to click the capture image button Id been using before. I closed the laptop and went to the burger place down the street. I stuffed myself with bacon cheeseburgers and fries, rolled myself home, and went to bed.

When I got to work this morning, I opened my laptop and the website was still open. Once the WiFi connected, the page automatically refreshed and the live caption resumed. It detected I was tired and captioned the first picture, NEEDS BETTER PILLOW - BEARD NOT FLUFFY ENOUGH. In my sleep-deprived state at 7:00am, I thought it was pretty funny. I let the thing run in the background while I did my work.

About an hour ago, I remembered I had the site running. I checked the picture pool and it was loaded with captures of my face, along with various captions. As I scrolled through the more recent ones, though, something had changed. The captions werent lining up with my expressions. All the ones before, despite being silly, were more-or-less in line with whatever I was expressing. These last ones were different. Different and wrong. I downloaded them and put them on Imgur so they wouldnt get lost.

I dont know what to think. I was pretty sure someone was playing a joke and I tried to send an email to the site administrator to compliment them for making such an interesting site. When I clicked the Contact button at the bottom of the site, I got an error. I tried to go back, but again, there was another error. I tried going to the site on my work computer, but I keep getting the same ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED message. 

So yeah, if anyones able to get on expressioncaptioner.com, just let me know. The domain lookup says it isnt even registered, but Im assuming thats a mistake because my browser history is full of my visits to the site. Im not a superstitious person, but I gotta say - Im not feeling too well after all this. Its also getting pretty dark outside, but there isnt a cloud in the sky. Its not even 11:00am.

<TEXT> Ive been Beths closest friend since we were toddlers. All throughout elementary, middle, and high school, we were inseparable. It was only after we went to separate colleges that we spent any significant amount of time apart. For me, it was borderline devastating. It wasnt the loneliness that bothered me most. It was how Beth, in the very week she began attending school, found a boyfriend who replaced me as the most important person in her life.

We still spoke on the phone with relative frequency during the first couple weeks of school. The frequency diminished, though, as Beth dedicated more and more of her side of the conversation to gush about her love for Luke, the boyfriend. Without ever meeting him, I knew he was using her. And I was right. After a month, Beth was tossed aside and Luke was never seen again. Gradually, the conversations between Beth and me resumed their pre-Luke frequency, but I could tell something was dreadfully wrong. It was only during our Christmas vacation that Beth confessed why she wouldnt be returning to school the next semester.

Beth was pregnant. She insisted she was on the pill and Luke had worn a condom every time, but her claims didnt matter much. The pregnancy tests were positive and a visit to Planned Parenthood confirmed what the tests already told her. Somehow, in a terrible move motivated by fear, Beth told her parents. They responded by revoking their promise to pay her tuition and insisted that she move back at the end of the semester or shed never be welcome in their home again. 

Were both from a small town in Florida. Our families are religious, but Beths parents are fanatics. The idea of a pregnant daughter infuriated and terrified them. In their flailing and hysterical confusion, they determined the best course of action would be to send her to a religious order where she could have the baby, give it up for adoption, and devote her life to the church. If the whole situation were on a television show, I would have found it almost funny; a parody of the most exaggerated customs of the irredeemably religious. But this was real. And Beth was going to suffer because of them.

Id carefully brought up the idea of abortion. It was not a possibility. Beth was 17 at the time and Florida law required the consent of at least one parent to make the procedure legal. We knew her parents might react violently to even the suggestion of abortion, so we couldnt approach them. On Christmas Eve, after wed discussed her options for hours upon hours in hushed voices in my parents living room, Beth asked the question: Do you think you can do it?

I began shaking. As soon as I mentioned the abortion idea, I was terrified shed ask me to conduct the procedure if all other options fell through. And the worst part was I knew Id do it if she asked. I couldnt let her be imprisoned by her parents church and be forced to devote herself to a group for whom she felt nothing but fear and contempt. 

After we parted ways for the night, I locked myself in my bedroom and looked for videos of the procedure. I felt intense nausea and sympathetic pain as I watched all the necessary steps - the brutal things Id have to do to my best friend. Gradual dilation. Violent evacuation. No anesthesia, no support. Nothing except the futile comfort Id try to provide; comfort from the same person who was inflicting the pain. I hadnt touched Beth yet and I already felt like a torturer. 

I called her early the following week and tried to explain what Id have to do. I was explicit as possible; part of me hoped the details would frighten her and shed abandon the idea all together. But that wasnt an option - not for either of us. She needed to be free from the situation that would condemn her to a life of pious imprisonment, and I couldnt live with myself if I were to change her mind. Id be just as bad as her parents.

At the end of the conversation, our plan was in place. It was less a plan than it was mutual resignation; two terrified and desperate people with minds made up to go through with something unavoidable. The next day, Id collect the implements Id need. The day after, wed go through with it.

I purchased an assortment of smooth, wooden dowels of varying widths. I shuddered when I touched the widest one. Next, I went to the drugstore and bought a few packs of condoms. I recognized the cashier from high school and tried to ignore her stare of disgust and disapproval. At another store, I bought more innocuous-looking items: gauze, cotton, peroxide, and painkillers. The painkillers were purchased almost as a joke; I knew theyd be all but useless. I couldnt stop thinking about the width of that last dowel. 

The day after, I met Beth where wed agreed would be the least likely spot where wed be interrupted, and, most importantly, where she could feel free to yell if she felt the need. No one came to that part of the city anymore. It was an old industrial park thatd been abandoned decades ago. Not even the local teenagers or homeless bothered to venture into those warehouses anymore. Half of them had caved-in roofs and the other half were plagued by rats and other unpleasant conditions that made visits not worth anyones while. For Beth and me, though, it was the only conceivable spot. It was cold, filthy, and a little scary. These were the lengths to which wed been driven.

We didnt talk much in the time leading up to the procedure. There wasnt really anything we could say. I prepared the makeshift tools to the best of my ability and Beth used her phone to watch the same, terrifying video I used a couple nights back to learn what I needed to do. She was shaking slightly. The trembling only increased when she removed her pants and wrapped a blanket around her waist.

When I was ready to start, I did my best to hide the feelings which threatened to pour out of me in a torrent of sobs and pathetic bleating. Beth needed me to stay in control. She wasnt crying, and she was the one whod have to endure this indignity. I admired her composure. As I was preparing to insert the first dowel, Beths phone rang.

Oh my God, she whispered, and jumped to her feet. Wrapping the blanket around her waist again, she paced back and forth while talking in a hushed voice. She was crying. I prayed it wasnt her parents. They were so, so good at emotional manipulation.

Beth hung up and headed back to me. It wasnt her parents. For the first time in months, it was Luke. He was on his way to Florida. He wanted to see her and take her away and they could raise their baby together. When Beth told me this past part, she whispered so quietly I needed her to repeat it. In a voice equally hushed but contained a haunted aspect Ive never heard from her before, she said again: I never told him I was pregnant.

The chill I felt had nothing to do with the coldness of the dilapidated warehouse. Beth resumed her position and set her jaw. Her look of fear had changed to something wholly different. She was determined. Do it, she instructed. Now.

An hour went by as Beth exhibited a strength I never knew she had. She whimpered and winced, but not once did she cry out. I felt intense nausea as I inserted the progressively-wider dowels, having to stop more than once to look away from the bloody blanket underneath her and tried my best to disassociate from the situation for a minute or two. This isnt me, I tried to convince myself. I wouldnt do something like this. When the waves of nausea passed and Id calmed down as best I could, I kept going. 

The widest dowel was in place. Beth had removed the condom from of the previously-used dilators and had the wooden rod clenched between her teeth. I didnt know if it was doing her any good, but she hadnt cried out. Tears flowed from both of us as I removed the last one and took the thin forceps from the jar of rubbing alcohol where theyd been soaking. Before the instrument could touch Beth, a crash echoed through the cavernous warehouse. It was the door wed been unable to unlock. Wed used the broken window to climb in. But it was undoubtedly the door wed heard, and from across the football field-sized building, we saw a person striding toward us.

Beth again jumped to her feet, this time yelping when she moved. She scrambled to wrap the blanket around her as the figure moved toward us. No, sighed Beth, as she finally recognized who it was. Luke, she breathed at me. Id already figured it out. The closer he came, the more frightened I grew. He was massive. At least 66. And muscular. He moved with the heavy, effortless grace of a of a silverback gorilla. The sunlight coming in through the holes in the roof flashed off his pale skin as he got nearer.

I tried to stand in front of Beth as Luke barreled toward her, but I was pushed away and landed hard on the filthy floor. He reached Beth, whod huddled against the wall. Luke grasped her shirt in his enormous right hand and lifted her from the ground. Beth flailed and landed weak, futile kicks on his body. Luke stared into her eyes for a moment, then he looked around at the bloodstained instruments on the towel next to where Id sat. 

No, Luke hissed into Beths face as she hung limply from his grasp, not bothering to fight him anymore. I tried rushing at him, but again he pushed me away and I fell hard on the floor. 

No, he repeated. You dont get to do that. I need him.

As the words left his mouth, something happened. Luke left arm, which had hung at his side, began to twitch. His hand deformed. Sharp cracks rang out as the shape changed. His fingers elongated and moved with a dextrous articulation I can only associate with tentacles or tendrils. When the fingers were nearly twice their original length, he moved his hand between her naked thighs.

Give him to me, Luke growled. For the first time, Beth screamed. I watched helplessly as she tried to clamp her legs together, only to have them wrenched apart by the impossibly strong thumb and pinky of Lukes reshaped hand. The middle three digits pushed upward as Beths scream rose a full octave. 

Mine, Luke whispered, as he slowly withdrew the fingers. Clasped delicately between them was a red lump no bigger than a lemon. It writhed his his grasp. Its shape was vaguely fetal with a distinct head and body, but the rest was alien. Tiny arms and legs split over and over, fanning out like progressively-thinner cilia. They gripped Lukes fingers. 

Luke dropped Beth to the floor. I heard her ankle snap when she landed and she cried out and grasped the injury as she stared up at the creatures in front of her. 

The fetus-thing crawled up Lukes hand and arm, leaving a trail of slime as it went. It nestled in the crook of his arm and remained there. I couldve sworn I heard it coo with contentment.

Luke looked at both of us. Tell whoever you want, he said with bemusement. Let them laugh at you.

He turned, and as he walked away and I scrambled over to help Beth, he turned to face us again. In a year, theyll wish they took you seriously. Everyone will.

<TEXT> I lost my husband and my daughter last summer. I was a wife and a mother. Now Im neither. Im alone in a big house overlooking the lake that stole the loves of my life. 

Sometimes, when the house is quiet, Maria, the housekeeper, says she hears them talking and laughing together. I dont know if shes telling the truth or just saying it to make me think theyre watching over me with love in their ghostly hearts. It doesnt particularly matter. I know theyre dead. If anyones watching over me, its Maria.

My life is a haze of daydreams and inactivity. The payout from Franklins life insurance policy means I wont have to work again if I dont want to. I probably will at some point. Im just not ready yet. Every night, I go to bed wearing the same outfit I wore the last time I embraced my husband and daughter. Its not much comfort, but its better than nothing.

About two weeks ago, Maria said she saw footprints in the hallway while she cleaned. Wet ones. It took me an hour to calm her down. I love Maria, but her superstitions can sometimes cause problems. I assured her she couldnt have seen what she claimed, and I think I sounded pretty convincing. Still, in the back of my mind, I felt a twinge of fear. Not just fear; hope. But no. It was Marias superstition rubbing off on me.

Those slick trails Maria called footprints showed up every day since. She didnt complain and she didnt panic like the first time; she kept a stiff upper lip and cleaned up the water and mud without a word. I noticed the cross shed always worn inside her shirt was exposed now, signaling her faith to the world.

Yesterday morning, I woke up to all the floors in the house covered in muddy water. It was Sunday and Maria was off. I was glad; I didnt want her to have to see it. I wept as I mopped. I listened all day, praying Id hear the conversation and laughter Maria insisted shed heard when it was quiet. All I heard were the wet squelches of the mop with my pitiful sobs in the background.

Last night, before I could fall asleep, I heard something moving outside my bedroom door. I knew who it was. Without turning on the light, I sat up and watched as he came into the room, his body sloshing across the floor. His smell turned my stomach, but I didnt shrink away. Id been waiting for a whole year to see him again. I refused to be afraid. He whispered in my ear for a while, then he left. I bawled in my empty room until the sun came up.

Maria came at her usual time. She was surprised to see me awake. Id gotten up at five to clean all the water and mud before she would arrive an hour later. I greeted her with a cup of coffee and asked her to walk with me. She could tell I needed to talk to someone and shed always been my shoulder to cry on after Id lost Franklin and Erica. We strolled in silence through the backyard. We reached the lake and sat on the small dock.

I saw him last night, I confessed. I didnt look at her. I felt ashamed and nervous to admit such a thing.

Maria stared at me for a while, fingering the cross on her neck, before replying. I knew hed come back to you. Sometimes they just cant let go.

I didnt say anything for a while. The sun was coming over the treetops and burning the mist off the surface of the lake. I thought about the time Erica asked if the mist was the ghosts of dead fish. I thought it was the most adorable thing Id ever heard.

I stifled my tears brought on by the memory and asked Maria, do you ever miss them?

All the time, she sighed. Ill stand and look at their pictures on the mantle and just daydream when I should be working.

Maria held the cross tightly in her fingers as she spoke and stared at the ducks in the middle of the lake. I could tell she meant what she said. She turned to me and asked, when Franklin came last night, was Erica with him?

I sniffed and tears ran down my cheeks. I couldnt hold back my emotions anymore. Can I see your cross for a minute?

Maria looked puzzled for a second but unclasped the gold chain and handed it to me. It was warm from her hands. Heavier than Id expected, too. It wasnt Franklin, I whispered.

What do you mean?, inquired Maria, clearly confused.

The lake water rippled and the ducks flew away. Maria began to scream. I clutched her cross in my hand, feeling its edges digging into my skin. Silently, he rose from the lake. All of him; not just the part hed sent to me last night. Before Maria could run, hed wrapped his tendrils around her legs. His colossal bulk towered over us, all mouths and tentacles and tendrils and hideous, gaping orifices.

A thick, red tentacle with a purple gash in it descended onto the top of Marias head. Im sorry, I told her. The loudness of the sucking sounds caused birds to fly from the trees and my hands to cover my ears as I watched. Marias body contorted as she was turned inside-out, her femurs erupting from the hole in her head before her hips shattered the skull entirely.

He drank Maria as I clasped the chain from her cross around my neck. He was finished in minutes. A smaller, thinner tendril slithered up the side of my body and wrapped around my ear. Again. Next year. And I might give one back. 

I remember the agreement, I mumbled.

As I spoke, a yonic cavern in the main bulk of his body split open. The head and torso of Erica appeared. Her mouth opened and she vomited grayish-red jelly into the lake. She saw me and choked out, it hurts, Mom, before he re-sealed his hole and slipped, noiselessly, back into the water.

I walked back up to the house. Marias cross felt cold and heavy around my neck. I sat at the computer and sipped my tepid coffee. I browsed for a few minutes. There was no shortage of available housekeepers for hire. I sent a few messages and one replied immediately. Melissa. She gave me her number and we chatted for a little while. She was nice. Im interviewing her in person tomorrow morning. On the phone, she sounded excited.

<TITLE> A Very Bad Place to Hide </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-04 18:04:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was always good at hide and seek. While being small for my age sucked most of the time, it was one of my biggest assets when hiding. Combine that with my flexibility Id developed from being in gymnastics classes since I was four, everyone wanted me on their team when we played. Keep in mind this was before kids had video games and cell phones; if it sounds like we played a lot of hide and seek and that seems weird, well, maybe now it is. Back then, though, we didnt have anything else to do.

Maggies family didnt have much money and they lived a few blocks away from the junkyard. When the wind blew in a certain direction, their house smelled pretty bad. We got used to it, though, and we still liked hanging out there. Her parents were nice and always gave us chips and soda. I think they were happy Maggie had friends and wanted to make sure we kept visiting her. That didnt cross my mind at the time, though. All I cared about were the chips and soda. I liked Maggie; dont get me wrong, but chips and soda were chips and soda. 

During the summer months, despite being told not to, our small group would hop the fence of the junkyard and play hide and seek amidst the piles of old cars and dishwashers and microwave ovens. The one guy who worked there, Luis, didnt seem to care. Dont do anything stupid, hed tell us, before retreating back to the little shed that housed his television and beer. 

On Maggies birthday in August, her parents threw a surprise party. All in all, about 20 kids showed up. She had a great time and I was pleased that the wind wasnt blowing the smell of garbage into the party. A lot of the kids hadnt been there before and I didnt want them to be mean to Maggie or her parents if the place stunk. After cake and an impromptu water fight, a few kids left but about 14 of us remained to play hide and seek. For such a big game, we split into two teams - creatively named the Hiders and the Seekers. I was a Hider.

The whole neighborhood was fair game. The only catch was we werent allowed to hide in someones house. The Hiders would have ten minutes to hide before the Seekers would come out of Maggies living room and go looking for them. The penalty for being found was a water balloon to the face. If the Seekers couldnt find everyone from the other team in an hour, all the Seekers would get water ballooned. I didnt want to be found. I really, *really* wanted to be the one to throw a water balloon in Javiers face. Javier was a dick.

The moment our team was told to go hide, I took off like a shot for the junkyard. The other day when we were hanging around in there, I saw the perfect hiding spot for the next time we were going to play. As I ran, I saw a few kids jumping in bushes or climbing way up into trees. I remember thinking how great the trees were for hiding. The leaves were so thick you couldnt even see the individual branches. I was really excited for my team to win, even if I ended up getting found.

Once I hopped the fence to the junkyard, I made a beeline for that perfect hiding spot. An old refrigerator. I was moderately dismayed when I opened the door and there was still some gross, rotting food in there. I pulled it out as quick as I could, hid the stuff on the other side of a crumpled car, and jumped inside. Now, keep in mind even though I was young, I wasnt completely stupid. The fridge had a couple holes in the side that were probably from whatever piece of machinery had moved it. I knew Id be able to breathe without a problem. So, I situated myself at the bottom of the compartment, tucked my legs to my chest, and closed myself in using the shelf in the door.

It was dark, smelly, and hot. None of it mattered, though. I was giddy with the anticipation of potentially being the only one left unfound; the one whod win the Hiders the opportunity to give the Seekers a good soaking. Especially Javier. Time went by and I started getting a little sleepy. I might have dozed off for a minute or two, but I awoke with a start to the sound of a loud clattering. Before I could register concern or fear, something smashed into the back of the refrigerator, pitching it down on its front side. I smacked my head hard as it fell and might have lost consciousness for a little while.

When I came to my senses, I panicked. Whatever had fallen from the pile of junk to knock over my hiding spot mustve ended up partially resting on the fridge. It wouldnt budge. I screamed and yelled for Luis, hoping hed hear me. I thrashed around in the confined space, my limbs getting tangled in the wire racks of the remaining shelves which had been dislodged in the fall. I tried to straighten my legs, but they were too cramped against the sides and tangled in the racks to move more than a few inches. I was face down against the immovable door of the refrigerator. 

I noticed an intensely putrid smell coming from the area of the freezer near the top of my head. Something wet was spreading around my head and neck. Whatever had been in the freezer mustve gotten broken or unsealed by the impact. Then I felt something pinch my right earlobe. Hard. I yelped and tried to smack away whatever was biting me, but my arm was too tangled up. I pushed my shoulder up to my ear and hear a loud crunch as I killed it. It took me a second before I remembered what it was; Id seen a couple earwigs in the fridge before I hid inside. I thought Id gotten them out when I threw out the food, but apparently Id missed one.

I kept yelling and trying to get someones attention. Another pinch, this time on the other side of my head. There was nothing I could do about it. Not from the position I was in. I felt it again on the top of my head. I pushed my legs against the sides of the fridge hard and forced my head against the plastic in front of me. As I felt the bug crunch against my scalp, a rush of the foul liquid escaped the cracked freezer compartment. I realized pushing my head against the freezer had only made the crack worse, and I gagged as the stuff touched my lips.

The odor and nausea was forgotten quickly, though, as I felt pinches on my head, face, and neck. I felt the earwigs crawling on me, making their way down my shirt and toward my legs. I exploded with as much motion as I could muster, cutting my arms and legs on the wire racks that were trapping them and doing anything I could to slap the biting, pinching things off me. 

In the distance, I heard sirens. They were getting closer. Part of me was hoping theyd be coming to my rescue, but I knew there was no way they couldve known I was trapped. If Luis hadnt noticed, no one would notice. As the insects crawled over my trapped, contorted body and I struggled and screamed with no effect, I realized for the first time that I might die in there if no one found me. My hope was resting on Luis hearing me scream and the Seekers, even stupid Javier, thinking I might be hiding somewhere in the junkyard.

The sirens kept getting closer. It almost sounded like they were right across the street. I screamed as loud as my already-damaged vocal cords would allow. Then one of the insects crawled directly into my right ear.

I made a sound I never knew could come out of my mouth. I tried to jam my shoulder against my ear again, praying I could kill the thing before it went any deeper. I was unsuccessful. I heard, with terrifying volume, its hard body squeezing through the warm, tight canal. The scratching sound was worse than the countless sets of pincers still sinking into me as I flailed. I heard and felt the thing going deeper - so deep its mere presence was causing pain deep in my head - and with a violent scratching sound so loud it drowned out my screams, I knew it was up against my eardrum.

The sirens had stopped, but my screaming had not. More of the earwigs were seeking a warm, safe place where they could hide. As the one inside my head continued scratching at my eardrum, I felt at least two moving up the leg of my shorts. In any other situation, that wouldve been enough to get me to strip out of my clothes, no matter where I was or who was around. At that point, though, I was just grateful they werent biting. 

Id been trapped for about a half hour. My voice was raspy and my throat hurt worse than it had when I caught strep in the winter. The shriek of the sirens started up again and I jumped, sending the earwigs into attack mode again. I felt their pincers lock on my scalp, back, neck, and perineum. The one inside my ear pinched the wall of the canal. It sounded like the loudest click you can imagine and stars exploded in my vision from the pain. More sounds of abject terror and misery escaped my mouth.

More time went by. The fluid coating my body had begun to dry and turn tacky. Whenever I tried to lift my face from the surface it was resting on, my skin stuck to it. I had to jerk my head to free it, which only aggravated the earwigs. I wailed and sobbed for a while, knowing Id be found dead in a month with my body as rotten as the food Id pulled out to fit myself in the fridge.

An enormous crash made me jump and set off the bugs again. This time, I heard another person yelling. It was Luis. He was trying to get me to talk and say I was still okay. Hed heard me. I screamed that I was trapped and stuck and I needed help. Another crash - this time the world spun as the refrigerator was flipped onto its back and the doors were flung open. The light of the late afternoon blinded me and I felt strong hands pulling me up by my shirt. My eyes adjusted and I saw the face of Luis studying me before he started slapping me all over, crushing or pushing off the bugs covering me. I looked down at myself - there were hundreds of them coating my sticky clothes and skin. They covered me in a reddish brown mosaic, all of them attacking me with their long pincers as they panicked at the violence and light theyd been introduced to.

I pulled off my shirt and threw it on the ground and joined Luis in brushing the remaining earwigs off me. In my head, the one by my eardrum squirmed and pinched over and over. I screamed and Luis, concerned for my safety, picked me up under his arm and ran toward Maggies house. Hed seen me coming from there earlier before getting involved in whatever afternoon television he was watching. Apparently after realizing he hadnt seen me leave, he decided to look around to make sure I was okay. And I wasnt.

When we got to the house, Luis just said call 911 to Maggies parents and left to go back to work. I wondered where all the kids were, but only for about five seconds - that was the amount of time the earwig gave me before it started moving and pinching inside my ear. 

Ten minutes and countless inner-ear pinches later, a paramedic was using a pair of forceps to pull the thing out of my head. He showed it to me as it writhed the metal that was squeezing it. It was so much smaller than it felt. Welts had started to rise from a few of the parts of me that had been bitten multiple times. Mom arrived right around then, and at the request of the EMT, she was going to drive me to the hospital to get checked out. While we were walking out to the car, Maggie told me Ron had fallen out of the tree where he was hiding and broke his leg really badly. Those were the sirens Id heard. 

As I gingerly eased my shirtless, sore, and sticky body in the car, praying the earwig hadnt laid eggs inside my head, I was drenched by an explosion of water that soaked not only me, but the inside of Moms car. One of the balloons. Nice nipples, asshole!, Javier yelled over his shoulder as he ran away with Mom screaming at him. Such a dick.

<TITLE> Amy's Wish </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-28 17:49:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When Amy was four, I taught her the eyelash game. You know the one. Find an eyelash, close your eyes, make a wish, take a deeeeeeeep breath, and blow it into the air. If youre lucky, I told her, your wish will come true. Amy considered it for a moment, then announced it was a stupid game. I laughed and asked her not to say stupid anymore. I remember being glad she didnt think Santa and the Easter Bunny were stupid. That wouldve been a problem.

Right around Amys 7th birthday, she got a very special present: a new baby brother named Michael. Amy adored Michael from day one. Shed always ask to hold him, which we allowed once we were sure shed be gentle. She was. Michael was fond of his sister and if Dawn or I couldnt get him to stop crying, wed put him in Amys arms and hed calm right down. Needless to say, we were grateful.

When Michael was a year old, he developed a high fever. We rushed him to the emergency room where they successfully brought down his temperature, but something else was wrong. Tests revealed the worst possible scenario: leukemia. Hed have to begin treatments as soon as possible.

We didnt tell Amy the full story about her brothers illness, but she was able to figure out it was serious. I did my best to put on a brave face so Amy wouldnt get more upset than was necessary. For a little while, it worked. But a few months in, the emotions caught up with her. She descended into a sadness Id never seen in her young life. One night, over dinner, Amy started crying. Michael doesnt think I love him anymore, she informed me, as tears streamed down her face. It wasnt a question. She was certain. 

I felt like a terrible father. Caught up in the day-to-day living hell of my sons illness, Id neglected to help Amy cope with the feelings shed been forced to endure. At 39, I was having a horrible time dealing with it all; I couldnt imagine what it mustve been like for someone as young as Amy. 

After she went to bed, I called Dawn at the hospital and we tried to come up with something that might help. We decided she should visit Michael just to see that he was still okay and that the doctors and nurses were doing their best to make him better. Wed been reluctant to take her to the hospital because Michael was in such bad shape. We didnt know how shed handle the sight of him stuffed with tubes and hooked up to monitors, but we also knew too much time had passed. It was important for Amy to see her brother. 

When we arrived, Amy was only allowed to look at Michael through the window. To our surprise, she perked up right away. She waved and talked to him, knowing he couldnt hear her but still wanting to make the effort. I caught her smiling for the first time in a while.

I noticed two eyelashes stuck to Amys cheek. Hoping to add to her renewed sense of positivity and not caring if she thought it was stupid, I brushed them from her cheek onto my thumb. Then I asked her to make a wish, half expecting her to roll her eyes and go back to talking to Michael. To my surprise, she smiled again. She closed her eyes, thought for a moment, then blew the lashes away as hard as she could. Then she looked at her brother and grinned. I didnt need to ask what she wished for.

A couple weeks went by and Michaels condition improved. It was entirely unexpected and inexplicable; he just started getting better. But the relief brought by the improvement was short-lived. His condition deteriorated soon after. It was what Dawn and I knew would happen but were still unprepared for. Our beautiful son passed away on May 3rd, 2015.

Dawn and I were devastated. Obviously. But Amy was inconsolable. When she learned about Michaels brief improvement, she got it into her head that hed continue getting better. She refused to believe hed taken a turn for the worse. Then, when we explained to her that he had died, all she did was scream. She screamed and cried for days.

Over a month later, when the reality of life without Michael had finally sunk in and the three of us were gradually returning to our normal routines, I made it my goal to be more active in Amys life. Id been neither absent nor distant, but I wanted to be a force of positivity and support for my daughter. After such a trauma, it was what she needed. I made sure she was seeing the psychologist at school and I scheduled a family therapy session for the following week. I was determined to not let our family tragedy scar Amy any more than it had to.

The night before our therapy session, long after Id fallen asleep, I awoke to Amy standing next to the bed. I could hear her crying. I asked if she wanted to sleep with us for the night, but she didnt answer. Between her sobs, she was making a blowing sound. I could feel her breath on my face and bare chest. The crying continued. 

Are you okay, hon?, I asked, fumbling for the lightswitch on the old lamp next to the bed. The crying and blowing sounds intensified. Finally, I found the switch and clicked it on. I gasped.

Amys face was drenched with blood. She glared at me with her eyes wide with a combination of terror and rage. She had her hand up to her mouth and was blowing into it. As my eyes adjusted to the brightness of the lamp, I shouted. Dawn awoke with a start and screamed. In Amys hand were two, bloody pieces of skin with hair bristling out of them. She kept glaring at me as she sobbed. No, not glaring, I realized. Panic bloomed inside my chest and and I struggled to breathe. Ragged flesh dripped blood into Amys eyes as she blew hot, panicked breaths onto the amputated eyelids in her palm. The lashes swayed in the humid wind. 

I keep wishing Michael would come back, she sobbed. But Im no good at it.

Can you help me wish? Please?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone, Im a community moderator for a popular medical website. Yesterday, I saw a [post that talked about a procedure a person did on himself while asking for advice from our resident experts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4bnqkb/to_the_kind_folks_at_webmd/). That was on our site. If you search for it there, you will not find it. Listen to what I have to say. I think youll want to hear it.

Where I work, there are some cases were required to hide if it looks like theyre promoting self-injury or have the potential to be a prank. Obviously, with millions of users coming to the site each day, its tough to be 100% accurate with all the content, but we have other employees who flag the posts that might fall under those categories. My job is to investigate the flagged posts and hide them accordingly.

Over the last couple years, the number of people hired to read and flag the posts has gone up dramatically. Its not only made my job harder because I need to go through a lot more content, but its increased the number posts I had to hide. For a while, I just thought the company was being overzealous with wanting to protect new users from seeing something too disturbing and leaving before their visit could bring in ad impressions. It didnt take long before I discovered something was up. Here are three random cases I was required to hide:

**Case 1**

*April 22, 2014  
1:45am*

*My names Leonard and Im hoping a doc or nurse can reply with some advice. I had a hell of a headache for the last couple weeks. I thought it was allergies because of how Id been all congested and snoring lately, but none of the OTC stuff helped. Over the weekend, the headache got a little better but the snoring persisted and I started getting itchy. Not really sure how to put it, but my foreskin felt crazy tight and like there were mosquitos biting the skin underneath. Now, Ive never been with anyone other than my wife since weve been married but shes always had suspicions about me, so Im a little nervous about telling her because shell think I was cheating. I dont want to go to the doctor yet because Im under her insurance and shell see the visit on her policy statement. Any advice?*

*April 24, 2014  
3:32am*

*Hi, Leonard again - I dont know if you got my last message but the itching got a lot worse and I had to cut away the skin to get at the problem. Its still bleeding a lot and Im kinda worried, so can you please let me know what I should do? My wifes sleeping right now and itd be great if you could get back to me before morning. Im on the east coast, if that matters. Itll be daylight in three hours or so. Thanks again.*

**Case 2**

*February 11, 2015  
4:01pm*

*I think this is the right forum to put this in but feel free to move it if its not. Ive had a splitting headache since January and its starting to get hard for me to concentrate on my schoolwork. Tylenol and Advil dont do anything, either. There are times when the pain almost goes away, but when it does, I feel itching everywhere. When I was sleeping the other night I mustve scratched myself really hard because there are terrible nail scrapes all over my thighs and stomach. Im a little scared to go to the student infirmary because they might think I got assaulted and I dont want to deal with that stress on top of everything else.*

*February 12, 2015  
4:17pm*

*Its been a day and I havent gotten any responses yet? I checked my spam filter in my email and there werent any messages or anything so I dont know if either no one knows what to say or if its just too busy. Sorry if Im being a pain, but I scratched myself really, really badly again overnight and I think I mightve done damage to the inside of my ear. My fingernail was broken off and part of it was stuck inside. I can still hear ok but Im getting more concerned with every minute and the scratch is still bleeding. Message back, please.*

**Case 3**

*December 25, 2015  
5:32pm*

*Its probably a longshot that any doctors are working on Christmas, but hey its worth a try. My heads been killing me since the beginning of the month. Ive ignored it for the most part because I used to get migraines when I was a kid but they never lasted this long. Im only writing now because early this morning before the kids got up the headache went away but my skin felt like it was on fire. Like, no joke. The worst was around and between my toes. I scratched like a lunatic and started bleeding and Ive been walking around all day with bloody socks. I had to excuse myself from our Christmas dinner so I could message you all because it was terribly distracting. I look forward to your response. Oh, and my wifes been complaining about me snoring a lot lately, too - I dont know if it means anything, but I feel I should mention it.*

*December 25, 2015  
11:50pm*

*I know its nuts to think Ill get a reply at this time on this day, but the itching is getting a lot worse. Now its my neck and scalp. I took some Benadryl and my wifes concerned and wants me to go to the ER. She hasnt even seen my feet yet. I cant stop scratching my neck and Ive drawn blood on my scalp. If I dont hear back by tomorrow, I might have to go to the hospital. Please let me know - this is torture.*

Those are three of literally thousands of similar complaints. The one yesterday, with the man and his uvula, was the 20th manifestation of self-injury reported that day. While he didnt mention a headache, the number of messages containing snoring, headaches, and self-injury are too numerous and related to ignore. The question is, why are ALL these being flagged and hidden? Even the times I unflagged one of them and let it go through, within minutes someone in the other office reflagged it and it was gone soon after.

I have so many more examples to share if it will help get the word out. Please spread this around. If anyones experiencing the symptoms Im talking about, post about it on social media. Use the tag #hiddensick. People need to know whats going on and right now, its being actively covered up.

<TEXT> *March 22, 2016  
7:15 am* 

I tried to snip off my uvula an hour or two ago. I read online that problems with my uvula can be why I snore so bad and I didnt want to make my girlfriend deal with it. She doesnt want to sleep over anymore and Ive got no insurance and cant afford the doctor to get it fixed.

Anyway, I tried to cut it off but its still hanging by a thread and I dont know whether or not I should cut it or leave it. It hurts a lot but I think the bleeding stopped for the most part. Let me know.

*March 22, 2016  
8:19 am*

Hi guys, I havent heard anything back yet so I did some more research and it seems like the upper palate can be a problem with snoring too? I dont want to do anything major yet just because I want to be careful, so just reply back when you can ok?

*March 22, 2016  
10:00 am*

Sorry if Im being a pain but Christines coming tonight and I want to make sure she can stay over without being bothered. I keep feeling like I have to swallow because my uvula is dangling back and forth and hitting my tonsils. Im worried if I swallow too hard itll get sucked in and Ill choke. Thanks.

*March 22, 2016  
12:43 pm*

I know you guys are kinda busy but I need some help. My stupid scissors wouldnt reach all the way and they couldnt cut through with just the tip so I grabbed it between my index and middle fingers and pulled it off. It hurt real bad and its still bleeding, but not as much as it did at first. The problem is when I pulled I felt and maybe even heard something up in my soft palate ripping. I know I shouldve tried again with the scissors because they worked when I did the majority of the cutting, but I got sick of the feeling of having to swallow all the time.

I think I can see where it mightve ripped from so Im gonna see if I can fix it.

*March 22, 2016  
1:22pm*

Guys Im a tiny bit worried over here and Id appreciate some advice for real. I used one of those tomato knives I got for Christmas and used the serrated part to cut away the part of my palate that had the piece torn off it. I got a little piece out the size of a penny after I cut into it and pulled with my fingers, but it just doesnt feel right. I mean obviously it hurts like hell and Im bleeding pretty bad, but like I can put my tongue up inside where the roof of my mouth was.

*March 22, 2016  
2:15pm*

Ok so while I waited I read that tonsils might be the biggest culprit with snoring so Im gonna see what I can do with those. I think thatll take a while so Ill probably have some advice from you guys waiting for me.

<TEXT> Ive lived in the same house for 40 years. After Ralph passed and I was left alone for the first time in three decades, I turned to my neighbors for comfort. They provided it in spades. I was honored and brought to tears by their kindness. Not too many places would make sure a lonely old man was taken care of. Im surrounded by wonderful, beautiful people.

I took on the role of a grandfather to some of the neighborhood children. I was more than happy to babysit; Ralph and I always wanted to adopt but it wasnt permitted in our state. So, having the opportunity to be a formative figure in the lives of these children was a great privilege. It made me feel like I was getting another chance to do everything that had been denied to me. I wish Ralph couldve been here to take part. Still, I know hes watching with the same love and pride he expressed every day he was alive.

One girl, Madison, formed a particularly strong connection to me. Her father was out of the picture. Her mom, Helen, who was forced to work full time, was rarely home during the day. Helen had always been the most supportive and loving of the neighbors after Ralphs death, so when I had the opportunity to help with Madison and watch her during the work day, I was more than willing.

I started looking after Madison soon after her 10th birthday. She fell in love with the collection of toy kangaroos all over the house. Ralph was born in Australia and I always used to call him my little roo -- especially when he got excited and his accent became more pronounced. On his birthdays, Id give him some type of kangaroo toy. Theyd been gathering dust after his passing and I was glad Madison could give them some life again.

Years passed and Madison started to grow up. I worried she was becoming depressed. She never had very many friends in school. Shed come straight over when her day was done and do her homework while waiting for her mom. Her mood was less bubbly than Id remembered. Part of it, Im sure, was her age. Adolescence is tough for everyone, let alone someone with a difficult family life like Madison. Still, I worried about her. She was perfectly nice to me and was never rude or disrespectful, but shed withdrawn. She didnt watch television with me anymore after her homework, either. Shed just sit on the floor in her kangaroo pajamas, which were far too small for her at that point, playing with Ralphs figurines. Just like she did when she was little.

When Madison was 16, she got a boyfriend. Her first one, as far as I knew. I didnt like him. At all. He was your typical teenage tough-guy type; a chain-smoking, foul-mouthed loser. There wasnt anything I could do about it, though. Madison wouldnt bring him over and I think she sensed I didnt approve. But it wasnt my business. I told myself years before that such situations were purely between Madison and her mother. Only if I felt like Madison was in danger would I interfere.

Madison spent more and more time with the boyfriend and less and less with me. The house grew quiet again. The other children Id taken care of had grown old enough to watch themselves. Their parents stopped by every so often for coffee, but my general person-to-person interaction was far less than Id previously enjoyed. I was lonely. 

One night, Helen came to me in a panic. Apparently, Madison had admitted to using drugs. Helen had no idea what kind or anything like that, but she was terrified for her daughters safety. I tried to reassure her that there had to be something the school could do, but that was when she told me the other half of the story: Madison was pregnant.

This floored me. Id seen Madison around town over the last few months and Id noticed shed gained some weight, but it never occurred to me she might be pregnant. Now her drug use was even more worrying. We tried to figure out a plan together and the only thing we could agree on was that the school had to know. Even though the local school system wasnt the best, they had to have some resources dedicated to problems like these.

The school did nothing. Madisons reckless behavior continued. Helen was too terrified to notify the police because she feared shed be put in a foster home. I, too, was clueless. Time went by and the rare times Id see Madison in town, shed be stumbling around drunkenly with her idiot boyfriend, her protrusive belly an obscenity against the background of her intoxication. 

On a late afternoon in February, I was leaving the supermarket when Madison spotted me from across the parking lot. She wasnt with her boyfriend, thankfully. She rushed up to me and gave me a big hug. She didnt seem drunk, but she had to have been on something. Her pupils were dilated and her words were slurred as she said how much she missed me. Then she asked if she could come over later to see the kangaroos. I told her that would be wonderful and that I missed her. 

At some point around 7, Madison came over. I ushered her in quickly; it was way below freezing outside and she looked ill. I could tell she was high. She shuffled in without saying hello and went to the mantle where the kangaroos stood. In a singsong, childish voice, she talked to them. When she was 11, I thought that type of thing was cute. Now, though, knowing she was under the influence of something that was poisoning not only her, but the baby as well, it was far less adorable.

I walked up to her and asked if I could take her coat and if shed like some tea and chocolate cake. She didnt reply. She just kept talking to the kangaroos. I sighed and sat down on the couch, waiting for her to either snap out of it and talk to me or leave and hopefully go home to her mom. 

Madison went down the line of the kangaroo toys on the mantle, saying I love you to each one. Then she walked back, doing the same thing in reverse order. Then she faced me. I love you too, Michael, she cooed, a thin smile cracking her pale face. But you know what? I love Roo most of all!

Madison dropped her heavy coat to the floor and I screamed. A gaping wound had been carved across the top of her belly. The blue head and chest and right arm of her baby stuck out from the opening. Look at little Roo, she said weakly. Such a good little Roo. Madison tried to hop toward me, mimicking a kangaroo. The limp head and arm of the child flopped back and forth with the movement. 

Sweet little Roo. All warm and safe in his pouch.

<TITLE> The Floor is Lava </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was a kid, I used to play games like The Floor is Lava with my brother, Greg. I didnt like it too much. Greg was far more athletic than I. Older, too. Hed do all these graceful steps and great, balletic leaps that were way beyond anything my pudgy body could do. When Id fall and lose the game, hed gloat for a while and then wed go off and play something else.

My neighbor, Mr. Clayton, would always watch us from the other side of the fence that separated our backyards. Mom said to stay away from him, but she couldnt stop the guy from watching us play. He seemed harmless, if not a little weird. We didnt pay him much attention. All afternoon, hed watch us run races or throw the football around, only leaving his place behind the fence if he wanted to refresh his drink. Every so often, Greg would say, hi Mr. Clayton and give a big, exaggerated wave. Mr. Clayton just smiled awkwardly and looked down at the ground. To be honest, I felt a little bad for the man.

On an afternoon in late June, right after wed gotten out of school and the day after Gregs 15th birthday, he and I were roughhousing outside. We did that often. Even though he was older and taller, because of my extra heft, we were roughly the same weight. He was still much stronger and more agile, though, so he always got the better of me and pinned me down. After another win by Greg, he had me helpless on the ground while he crowed over me. While I waited for him to get off, I glanced over to the side. I could see Mr. Clayton watching us with rapt attention. His right shoulder was moving back and forth. Even though I was 11, I had a pretty good idea what he was doing.

Lets go inside, I told Greg. The tone of my voice was much different than what Greg was used to, so he sensed something was going on and let me up. I didnt tell him what I saw. 

Mr. Clayton wasnt in his yard for a few days after that. While I was reluctant to go out and play again, I kept reminding myself that the guy was harmless. Not only that, but Greg could certainly kick his ass if he ever tried anything. So things went on like they normally did, with Mr. Clayton reassuming his position behind the fence later that week.

After the July 4th weekend, Greg had a couple of his friends over. Dion and his brother, Rob. Dion was okay but Rob was a total asshole. A bully. I hated when he visited because Greg felt like he had to impress him. And thats what was happening. The four of us had climbed into the dilapidated treehouse thatd been on the property before wed moved in. The thing was a wreck. Floorboards were missing and countless spiders had made the place their home. Still, for whatever reason, there we were.

Rob was bragging about doing something to some girl over the weekend. Greg and Dion laughed along while I sat there, bored out of my mind. One of them had the great idea to have a pull-up contest using one of the branches above our heads. Rob took off his shirt to show off his muscular body, prompting the other two to take theirs off, as well. They did their pull-ups. Rob, unsurprisingly, won. After hed made fun of them for being so weak, he turned his attention on me. 

Go ahead, he sneered. Its your turn.

I told him I didnt want to. The others started to taunt me until I gave in and tried to do a pull-up. Obviously, I couldnt. They all laughed.

Come on, take your shirt off!, laughed Rob. I did, with some reluctance. When Dion and Rob saw my chubby body, they started giggling. Try again!, Rob shouted. As I strained and pulled, I felt pain explode across my back. Rob had slapped me as hard as he could. I yelped and cowered, but he kept slapping my back and chest while Dion and Greg looked on without protesting. Once Rob stopped, he said, now watch those handprints show up.

They watched. True to his word, the prints rose out of the angry, red flesh while they giggled maniacally. 

Hey Steve, said Greg. The floor is lava. 

I told him I didnt want to play and started to climb down from the treehouse. Rob blocked my exit. Youre playing, he informed me.

I was ordered to jump the gap between the floorboards. There was no way Id be able to do it. I knew what I was capable of, and that just wasnt even close. All three boys whooped and hollered at me to do it. I stood my ground. Thats when my brother started hitting me. Not slaps, either. Punches. He rained blows down on my lower back before getting in close to my ear and hissing, just do it you fucking baby. 

As much as I tried to keep it in, I started crying. After a couple minutes, Greg got bored of hitting me. I curled up in the corner as Rob changed the subject back to the girl hed been with over the weekend. While they laughed and asked typical, obscene questions, I sobbed pathetically. Rob looked at his watch and swore once he noticed it was much later than hed thought. He and his brother climbed down the creaky ladder and left.

Greg followed them, leaving me alone in the treehouse. I stayed there for an hour, seething. It would still be another three hours before mom would be getting home from work. If I had to wait up there the whole time, so be it. I didnt want to see my brother. 

Mr. Clayton stared up at the entrance of the treehouse while I sat with my legs dangling over the side. Greg came back out an hour later. He climbed the ladder and pushed me backward onto the floor. I stared up at him as the splintery wood dug into my bare, handprint-covered back.

You embarrassed me in front of my friends, you little piece of shit, he hissed. You fucking faggot. You fucking pussy.

He circled around like he was about to start hitting me again. Then I noticed where he was. Without thinking, I kicked him in the knees as hard as I could. He gasped and stumbled backward. He dropped through the missing planks in the floor, striking his chin on the wood as he went, shattering his teeth. I heard a loud thump as he hit the ground below.

I took my time climbing down the ladder. Once I reached the ground, I walked over to my brother. His face was a rictus of blood and he drooled shards of teeth out of his mouth onto the grass. 

I cant move, he wheezed. My legs. Arms.

I kicked him in the chest. I thought the floor was lava, you fuck, I whispered. Why didnt you jump? I kicked him again.

My neighbor watched from his side of the fence, his right shoulder moving furiously as he stared at our shirtless bodies. I smiled.

Hes all yours, I informed Mr. Clayton. 

As walked back toward the house, I looked over my shoulder just in time to see my neighbor hauling himself over the fence.

<TITLE> Malique, part 1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-11 17:19:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Loretta and I are the adoptive parents to a young man named Malique. Malique grew up in a terrible area of Philadelphia. Gang activity was rampant, violence was ubiquitous, and hopelessness was endemic. The result of living in this environment was a terrified, deeply disturbed boy. To make matters worse, he didnt know his father and his mother had wasted away from untreated AIDS. His only sibling, an older brother, was in prison for murder. By the age of 13, following the death of his mother, Malique was living on the street. He was discovered by a patrol car, huddled next to a trash can. They initially thought he was dead.

After a period of physical recovery, he was shuffled from foster home to foster home. To make a very, *very* long story short, we adopted him. Wed been hoping to adopt a child for many years. After learning about Maliques story and getting the opportunity to meet him, we knew wed be able to give him a better life. 

As is customary, he stayed with us for a few supervised weekends to make sure the relationship would be the right fit. Not just for us, but for him, too. Those weekends were a joy. We were surprised by how sweetly he acted toward us. Loretta had worried his lifetime of trauma might make him angry and prone to outbursts, but not once during the four weekends he stayed with us did he show any hint of anger. Quite the opposite; he spoke with a quiet, shy sadness that practically screamed for the nurturing and warmth that had been denied to him.

On a snowy day in late November, Malique officially moved into our home. We knew the acclimation process would take a while. The hideous poverty hed endured all his life made our home seem palatial and ostentatious in comparison; I felt guilty having so much when he grew up with so little. 

Right away he began calling us mom and dad. Ill admit to crying the first 200 or so times I heard those words directed at Loretta and me. Wed wanted to be parents for so, so long. To be honest, Id given up hope. I never realized how depressed Id been until the shroud of it had lifted by the sound of our son calling us the names Id so desperately wanted to hear.

Malique was too fragile to start school. Further, his verbal and mathematical skills were pitifully low for a boy his age. His lifetime of trauma had provided no breathing room for education. Loretta received permission from the state to homeschool him. Before she retired the year before, she taught special education at the local public high school. She had 35 years of experience teaching children like Malique. Loretta knew, with time, he could be brought up to grade level.

A month went by. Malique remained as sweet as ever. His nervousness gradually evaporated, but his soft-spoken and tentative manner held; while we both hoped hed come out of his shell, we werent going to rush anything. We could see the life of horror and sadness frozen in his dark eyes. It would take far more than a month for that icy trauma to melt away.

Shortly after Christmas, Malique began to have nightmares. Loretta and I would hear horrible screams coming from his room and wed rush in and find him thrashing around on his bed, desperately trying to fight off whatever was terrorizing him in his dreams. It was the only time we ever heard his voice rise above the soft, near-whisper to which wed grown accustomed. To be honest, it was terrifying. The shrieks were so raw and violent I was afraid to comfort him for fear hed think I was another assailant. But my fears were baseless. Upon waking, he was as gentle as ever. Apologetic, too. It broke our hearts.

The nightmares persisted and I grew more concerned with every scream-filled night. I suggested to Loretta that he be allowed to sleep with us in our room, on a cot, where hed hopefully feel less alone and terrified. She agreed to try it out, and so did Malique. Surprisingly, it worked. Hed still toss and turn and mutter in his sleep, but the agonizing, torturous nightmares seemed to go away. We were all relieved.

Loretta and Malique came home from the store in the middle of January to find the kitchen in shambles. Id been at the bowling alley and was oblivious to the event until I received a call from my wife soon after. When I got home, the police were there. They said it looked like a breaking and entering, but there was no sign of forced entry. Loretta said it was possible shed forgotten to lock the doors, but as far as I knew, shed never forgotten before. Nothing was missing from the house, either. Apparently whoever broke in only wanted to trash the kitchen. No one was buying it. But there was no other explanation.

That night, Maliques nightmares came back with a vengeance. It took us nearly five minutes to rouse him from his sleep, and in the process, he hit me hard in the stomach and knocked the wind out of me. When I hit the ground, Malique woke up. He started sobbing and apologizing. The stress he so obviously felt was devastating. He clutched his knees to his chest and rocked back and forth, crying and telling me how sorry he was. I locked him in an embrace and he put his head against my chest. The moment our bodies connected, a colossal series of crashes tore through the house. Loretta was knocked off her feet and fell backwards, her fall arrested, thankfully, by our bed. I fell on top of Malique as picture frames shattered and our dresser toppled over. I could hear dishes breaking downstairs.

The three of us had no idea what was happening. Loretta immediately yelled that it was an earthquake, since shed lived in California when she was growing up and was used to them. But we live in Pennsylvania. Theres never been earthquakes like this for as long as weve lived there. I was terrified but I tried act brave for Malique, who was whimpering under me. When the violence had ended, I took my weight off him and sat on the cot. All he did was whisper apologies over and over.

Loretta righted herself and reached for the lamp that had fallen from her nightstand. The bulb was broken. She carefully walked over to the main light switch by the door and flipped it on. The overhead light illuminated the devastation around us. For the first time, I could see Maliques face. Blood trickled out of his nostrils and left crimson lines on his dark skin before hitting his white t-shirt and blooming outward. I grabbed a handful of tissues and told him to hold them against his nose and keep his head back. Then I looked at my wife. Her nose bled, too. But that wasnt what shocked me. Her hair was falling out of her head in thick, gray chunks. She hadnt noticed yet and my look of horror was making her nervous. What is it?, she asked, her raw, nude scalp gleaming wetly in the light. Are you and Malique okay?

<TEXT> If you do a Google search for Charles Robert Olevsky, nothing will come up. Well, maybe by the time you read this theyll have indexed this particular content, but aside from that, my name has been absent from the Internet. I lead a dull life. Im a daytrader. Upper-middle class. No family, few friends. To be honest, Im a homebody. Lifes just easier that way.

Last night, on a whim provoked by boredom, I did a Google search for my full name. I expected the usual nothing. But thats not what I encountered. There were hundreds of thousands of results: news articles, Wikipedia entries, social media mentions - even pictures. But they werent pictures I could ever remember taking part in. And I looked much older; at least 20 years. I was surrounded by uniformed men carrying weapons. In a confused and moderately terrified frenzy, I clicked the top article. My blood ran cold.

*Charles Robert Olevsky, founder and leader of the New White Dawn Militia, announced today the successful completion of his campaign to eliminate the immigrant threat from the Southern United States. This was the largest of the NWDM campaigns, resulting in the deaths of 250,000 immigrants or perceived immigrants. Following the overwhelming successes of the most recent NWDM actions and the lack of intervention from the US government, it is believed Charles Robert Olevsky will continue pushing south into Mexico.*

With trembling hands, I zoomed in on the photograph of me. On my wrist was the same watch I always wear. The one given to me by my father. Minutes ticked by and I read more and more about the atrocities Id been accused of committing. Mass murder. Systematic rapes as terror tactics. Torture. Every victim was innocent.

There were videos of me from the early days of the NWDM. Propaganda videos. Someone recorded while I walked down the street with an assault rifle slung on my back, intimidating and beating everyone who looked like they didnt belong in that particular area. Each video featured me committing different acts of violence. I performed the acts with a calm demeanor and spoke to the victim like a patronizing father explaining to his child why he had to be beaten. As the videos went on, I began killing them. When the families ran to the corpses of their loved ones, I shot them, too.

Before I could finish the video, my Internet connection died. I felt unbearably nauseous and dizzy. Guilty, too. That man couldnt be me. When my connection reestablished, I tried to resume the video. It wouldnt go. I closed the browser and tried again. When I typed in Charles Robert Olevsky, nothing came up. All Google showed me were other people who had either Charles or Robert or Olevsky in their names. Nothing mentioned me.

I opened my browsers history and clicked the links from the last half hour. Each one was a 404. There was nothing. I started to think I was losing my mind. But then I remembered the pictures of me wearing the exact same watch Ive worn for the last 30 years. The videos, though, were what shook me to my core. Nothing about my actions in them was anything like who I am as a person. I glanced over at the side of the desk where my printer stood. The package housing Rosetta Stones Learn Spanish sat on top. I thought about the scenes of those hideous videos. I started to cry. Every time I talked to one of the people I brutalized - every time I mocked them as they bled out, I spoke in perfect Spanish.

I wish I could say I developed a relationship with Joy following my return. Quite the opposite. She withdrew. Once she told me about what shed been experiencing and how the white man was influencing her life and actions, she was a ghost. Anyone who didnt know what was happening to her would have claimed shed retreated into a solipsistic world of hallucination. Shed wander through the house, muttering to herself. Shed talk about fulfilling her purpose and being a good mother. If I stood in front of her, shed bump into me, wait until I moved, and then keep going. The only times Id get a hint that Joy was still somewhat cognizant of the world outside her head was when she would put money in an envelope for the people who delivered our groceries.

When I say our groceries, I just mean my groceries. I was painfully obvious Joy was rarely, if ever, eating. The clothing that hung from her delicate bone structure when I arrived was forgotten after the first three weeks of my return. Shed walk around naked, her waxen flesh clinging like shrinkwrap to her bones and joints. A dark bruise covered her mouth and ran down her chin and throat, between her shrivelled breasts, to her emaciated belly. 

Days would go by when shed remain in her room, never leaving the bed. Images of the nightmarish body in which my beloved sister had become an organ flickered in and out of my perception.  When the flickers came, Id see the monstrous shape shed called the white man hovering above her; its thick umbilicus carrying gelatinous solids down her throat. The network of translucent, biological tubes throughout the home contracted and expanded as unidentifiable substances shuttled in and out of the white man.

Weeks went by. The old house, which had been so still the whole time Id been back, began to see activity. Real, tangible activity - not just my visions. Even though Joy never left her room anymore, she began to have visitors. Men. Men of all shapes and sizes and walks of life. Theyd enter the house, climb the stairs, spend a minute or two with my sister, and leave. They paid me no attention. Even when I followed one of them in and saw what theyd been doing to Joy, they acted like I wasnt there. Days went by. Hundreds and hundreds of men visited. After another week, they stopped. The house was silent again.

Joy, or what remained of her, wouldnt leave her bedroom. She couldnt if she wanted to. The damage from the weight of the hundreds of men had splintered her hips. But she was alive. She was wide-eyed and alert, breathing regularly, and being nourished by the atrocity which remained hovering above her. 

I wouldnt leave her alone for very long. I wanted to call an ambulance, but I knew Id be taken from the home and put in state custody if anyone discovered I was unguarded. That meant I stayed on or around the property. I grew more and more compelled to visit the tree which had caused me to miss so much time. Part of me was hoping the event would happen again and Id emerge in a future where things had somehow gotten better. I think, in the back of my mind, I needed even more. I wanted so badly to be pulled into the past and get to see my parents again. Even in Joys terrible physical state, she looked like the pictures Id seen of Mom when she was young. Sometimes the connection was too much for me to handle.

Once I made up my mind to venture into the forest to visit the tree, it came to me instead. I woke up and found it growing, upside-down, out of my ceiling. Unaffected by gravity, its long, thin branches stretched out in the same positions and angles as when Id first seen it. When I tried to touch the thing, my hand passed right through. During the phased flickers of my visions, I noticed the network of intestinal highways had detoured around the tree, giving it a wide berth. It remained there, visible yet untouchable, for a long time.

A month passed. Then two. The house was a tomb. I spent my time watching television next to my bedridden sister; her eyes wide with hope and her mouth gaping as the often-invisible tube delivered nourishment into her body. Shed taken to running her hands up and down her belly. It was another few months before I realized why. By then, the venerators had started showing up. Her venerators.

This part of the story is the hardest for me to tell. Even having to recall the deaths of my parents, which devastated me, wasnt as existentially disturbing as what happened to Joy. Much of it is a blur of terror and confusion. Its what I watched from the slatted door of her closet over the course of three days. I dont want to write about it for fear I will be a worse person for having to relive the events. But I need to. It has to be known.

Men and women came to see Joy as her body swelled with the new life inside her. They, too, paid me no attention. I was just part of the scenery. Still, as their numbers grew, I felt the need to hide. So I did. I watched from Joys closet as the room packed with people who spoke about her in hushed tones. Spoke about her baby with crazy, hyperbolic grandeur. When the room was at capacity and I could barely see between the venerators huddled against the closed door where I hid, it happened.

I want to say Joy gave birth, but that would be a lie. The child literally exploded out of her and showered the venerators nearest her pelvis with gore. Joy never made a sound. The venerators, though, began to weep. I couldnt see her baby. Somehow, though, I heard it. It was talking. And the nightmare began.

The venerators bit the skin from their bodies. One by one, they chewed it into a pulp and spit it into the mouth of the baby. The child started to steam. I could feel its heat and humidity from my hiding place. Once the baby was strong enough, it started to bite and chew the crowd on its own. The steam was blinding and I had to curl in a ball on the floor of the closet for fear of being burned. I cried as the sounds of chewing filled the room. Bodies fell to the floor, leaking their fluids into the closet and soaking my clothes. I sobbed and prayed it would end.

After a while, it did. The heat died down. The steam dissipated. I peeked out between the slats in the door again, and for the first time, I saw the child. But it wasnt an infant. She looked at least 12 or 13. She stood, naked and soaked with blood, over her mother. With a vile, wet sound, she regurgitated some of what shed consumed and drooled it into Joys mouth. My sister, whod been unconscious the whole time, awoke with a start. She looked around with bewilderment. When her eyes met those of the creature shed brought into the world, she began to scream.

The child walked toward the window and tore the panes away with an effortless motion. Then she dropped out of the house onto the ground below. I burst out of the closet and slipped and slid my way across the gore of the countless venerators bodies and went to my sister. She was still screaming. This time, I could tell it was from pain. The lower half of her body was gone. All that remained was a crater cauterized by the heat of whatever had happened. The rest of her skin, too, was burned. 

Where are you?, she screamed toward the ceiling. It took me a moment to realize the white man was gone. The images of the intestines spanning the house flickered back into my vision. Nothing was above my sister. Shed been abandoned. At that point, I knew Joy would die if she didnt receive medical attention. Shed probably die anyway. I ran from the room to make a phone call. There was no dial tone. The phones were disconnected. 

Frantically, I ran back to her, not knowing what to do. As I climbed the stairs, I stopped in my tracks. Long, black branches were travelling from the tree on my ceiling to the room of my sister. They touched the hideous wounds on her skin and pushed through, entering her ruined body. Her screaming stopped. I thought she had to be dead. But her eyes opened and she smiled at me. She reached toward her bedside table and opened the drawer. Inside was a note. I asked her if it was something I should read. Joy studied me for a moment, then nodded. She whispered something and I moved closer so I could hear. Extinguish the stars, Joy muttered. 

As dread filled me, I unfolded the letter and read aloud what shed left for me. Once I finished, the long limbs of the black tree began to shudder.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For as long as I can remember, Ive wanted to be an otter. When I was six, Mom brought me to the Maritime Center in Norwalk. It was my birthday. Things had been really difficult for us since Dad died the year before. Mom worked long hours and I spent so much time in day care. For a while, it felt like everything was falling apart. But Mom knew I was having a hard time. She did her best to let me know I was loved. And on my sixth birthday, I truly realized how much.

Mom knew how much I adored otters. I had pictures of them from National Geographic hung up all around my room. [This one was the best.](http://imgur.com/n2XyoJk) I had little stuffed otter toys, too, like [Ollie here.](http://imgur.com/K6pnkHp) They made me feel safe and happy. But until then, Id only seen otters on television and in magazines. When Mom surprised me with a trip to the Maritime Center, I started crying. We walked through the halls, bypassing all the aquariums featuring stingrays and jellyfish and giant lobsters. After what felt like an eternity, we made it to their glass-walled habitat.

I stood, transfixed, and watched their sleek, furry bodies navigate their enclosure. Itd been designed to look like the local estuary from which they came. I marvelled at how quickly they could dart across solid ground and dive into the water where theyd move with equal speed and grace. Then, as I watched, I finally saw it. Two otters, tired from playing around, floated together in the water. I shook with anticipation, praying Id get to witness what Id dreamed about. The otter on the right held out its left paw. The left otter held out its right. Then they clasped them together in a gesture of closeness while they peacefully floated.

While I watched the beautiful display, I felt a soft hand wrap around my own. It was mom. She looked down at me and smiled her warm, loving smile. We stayed that way for a long time.

Looking back, that was the best moment of my life. The decades that followed were nothing but heartbreak. Mom passed away when I was 14. Cancer. We had no other family, so I was put in foster care. My foster parents were kind, but distant. They didnt try to understand me. I know they thought I was weird. I guess maybe I was. A teenage boy with a love of otters and no friends doesnt sound normal. Because of that abnormality, I started getting picked on at school.

It started off innocuous. Just some name-calling in the hall. Freak, fag, retard; the basic high school Freshman insults. Over time, though, starting around my Sophomore year, the negativity got worse. A lot of it stemmed from when I tried to join the swim team. Id never been a competitive swimmer. I wasnt in particularly good shape, either. Add to that a body that was extraordinarily hairy for a 15 year old, and I became an easy target of the schools more vicious bullies.

Verbal insults increased in frequency and physical violence became the norm. I dont need to get into it, because it makes me sad to think about, but there were many times I was simply punched in the face as I walked down the hall. Sometimes Id get kicked in the crotch. One time, someone reached up my shirt and smeared their gum into my chest hair. And all the time, they laughed. I wouldnt wear my otter shirts anymore. The other students were ruthless with their bullying whenever they saw me with a picture of my favorite animal. Someone started a terrible rumor that since Id never had a girlfriend, I must have sex with otters. And when they noticed I cried whenever they insinuated such a hurtful, despicable act, it became their insult of choice.

Once or twice, school officials would punish the most flagrant abusers if their words or actions happened to be noticed. But for the most part, it was under the schools radar. I never said anything. As it all went on, my foster parents never had a clue because they never asked how I was doing. Even if they did, I dont think I would have told them. My grades were decent enough. Thats all that mattered to them.

By the time I was a Senior, the bulk of the bullying had died down. Still, not a day went by when I could say people were kind to me. I was growing sick of the feeling of isolation that plagued me from the moment I woke up to the time I collapsed back in my bed at night, usually in tears. When the school posted a notice asking for someone to work in the pool area in the afternoons, I decided to apply. It was pretty low-effort work. Some organizing, some water testing, but mostly just cleaning up the messes of the day. No one else was interested, so I was hired on the spot.

The shift was short; about 3 hours starting at 4pm. Most of the students were gone by then. The swim teams season was over, so they didnt have practice. Some of the teachers liked to swim and get some exercise around that time, though, so I made sure their locker rooms had towels and were relatively clean. It all went well. I made a few bucks. Nothing much, but more than I was used to.

Once everyone left, Id swim by myself. Id float on my back and glide through the still water while my imagination ran wild. Id imagine myself in an estuary filled with otters and fish and seabirds. Wed all be happy and everyone would get along. I stretched out my hand, half hoping another understanding person would grab it and wed float away together. Soon after, Id leave. While I walked home each night, I would cry.

After graduating high school, I kept the job. They were happy to have me. There wasnt a chance Id go to college and endure any more abuse, so I was perfectly content with keeping the status quo. My foster parents were glad to have me around, especially once I began giving them a small bit of my take-home money as rent.

When the next school year started up, the swim team started practicing again. Id hover around the pool area, doing my various jobs, and every so often Id hear the team laughing at me. Theyd point an insult or two in my direction, but Id just keep my head down and stay on task. After work, Id head home like I always did, have my dinner, and retreat to my bedroom where Id sit at my computer and watch videos of otters until I was too tired to continue. [This one was my favorite.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6uTMEiZf0) I still think about it all the time.

On a night in October, when I was finishing up my shift, someone was banging on the door to the pool and demanding that they be let in. It was two swim team members and their mother. Theyd missed practice in the afternoon and they said they had to get their laps in or else the coach would force them to miss their next meet. I apologized and said the pool was closed. Their mother started to yell, so I unlocked the door to let her in so we could discuss it. As soon as I opened it, her sons pushed by me, stripped down to their swimsuits, and jumped in the water. While the mother screamed, her pregnant belly bumping against me as she got closer and closer, I closed my eyes and wished I could run away. So I did.

I turned around and ran toward the supply room. Id left it open while I cleaned, so once I got in I slammed the door behind me, locked it, and sat on a bucket while I cried. The mother laughed at me from the other side of the door while yelling to her sons, is this that otter fucker you told me about? I heard the boys laughing as they did their laps. The woman gave one final pound on the door before she muttered, loud enough for me to hear, I cant imagine what that freaks mother must be like.

Everything went red, then white. I found myself travelling down a lazy river. I was on my back, staring at the sky. It was bright blue and dotted with puffy cumulous clouds. Thick, green grass grew all the way to the riverbank. As the river turned and I bumped into the grass, it felt soft against my furry skin. The water slowed as the river drained into a wide, clear lake. I craned my neck around and saw her. I let the gentle current take me, and I gradually drifted closer. Once I got there, I held out my paw. She grasped it in her own. 

Mom and I floated together for a while. The sensation of closeness was almost as wonderful as my birthday at the Maritime Center. Then it got even better. Mom had been hiding my new baby brother in the crook of her other arm. She reached over and sat him on my chest. He squirmed for a minute, but then he was still. Comfortable. Safe. I closed my eyes and felt the warm sun on my downy fur. 

When I opened my eyes, I was staring at the ceiling of the pool room. The bodies of the two swimmers floated lifelessly in the shallow end, blood blossoming in the water from their slit throats. I floated, silently, clasping the hand of their mother. She was facing the ceiling, breathing shallowly. I glanced over at her. A gaping wound in her belly was spilling blood all around us. Her breathing stopped. I felt her start to sink and I turned to pull her toward me, but something on my chest shifted and nearly fell. I dropped the dead womans hand and picked up what was resting on me. Her baby. It wasnt breathing.

I worked hard not to panic and I retreated back to my safe place. If I ever really wanted to be an otter, this was as close as Id get. I felt the sunlight on my fur again as I clutched my baby brother to my chest. I looked over, hoping mom would be there, ready to hold my hand. But shed ducked underwater to get us some fish to eat. It would all work out in the end. My paws stroked the tiny form of my brother as I floated in the tranquil lake, waiting anxiously for him to wake from his nap so we could play. I love him so, so much.

<TITLE> The Drooling Womb of the Sky </TITLE>

<TEXT> Months ago, my neighbor Gwen sent a [diary shed found](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3vb2jk/i_found_a_diary_while_i_was_out_hiking_in_new/) to the Centers for Disease Control which detailed the experiences of a woman and her husband 20 years ago. Everything written inside sounded like complete horseshit. Blair Witch Project and alien abduction and Lars Von Trier garbage all wrapped up in one cliche-loaded package. Still, there were some parts that concerned me enough to agree with Gwens belief that it should be investigated. Especially the nature of the fluids that had encrusted on the pages. Last month, she received a letter from the CDC thanking her for the diary, but thats it. No explanations. I figured shed made a big deal out of nothing.

A week ago, though, Gwen started acting strangely. Shed show up on at my door at all hours of the night. She didnt rant and rave like a lunatic, but she said really disconcerting things. Things about demons and hell and all sorts of satanic nonsense. Then shed point up at the sky and tell me to watch the red light. Always something about the red light. Like a light shining through blood, Gwen whispered. 

Since Id moved to the area a couple years ago, Gwen and I had gotten along pretty well. We hiked together and she helped me get to know the woods around our properties. Shed always been an avid hiker and knew far more about the forest than I, so I was grateful for her guidance. The other day, despite the strangeness of her late-night visits and claims, I agreed to go on a hike with her. It was inordinately warm for February, even up here in Pittsburg, NH. We traced out a route on the map and hit the trails.

A few miles in, we realized we hadnt dressed properly. It was far colder than wed anticipated. The wind had picked up and dead leaves were whipping by our legs while we walked. We decided to pick up the pace. Not long after, though, as snow began to fall, I was surprised to see bolts of lightning streaking across the sky. Wed had thundersnow up here before, but never with such strong electrical activity. Peals of thunder shook the forest and the snow came down in buckets. I started to worry, but Gwen told me to stay calm. She showed me how the sky in the distance was much brighter than the black clouds above us. The storm would be over shortly.

And she was right. Well, half right. The brightness moved in, but its color changed as it did. Once the stormclouds were gone, the sky was alive with dark-red atmospheric disturbances which reminded me of the mammatus clouds I used to see in Florida. But this was definitely not a cloud formation. I can only describe it as transparent liquid. I remembered what Gwen had whispered to me a few nights earlier: like a light shining through blood. I asked her, with obvious fear in my voice, is thats what shed seen. She told me it was, then hugged me while saying how relieved she was that I could see it too.

Minutes passed while we stood on the trail with our heads craned to the sky, transfixed by the seething undulations of the phenomenon. A sound unlike any Id ever heard detonated all around us, causing Gwen and me to jump and cover our ears. It was a bellowing drone that reminded me of a fog horn, only somehow organic and wet. I couldnt figure out what direction it was coming from; I just knew it was everywhere. 

My view of the sky shook as the amplitude of the noise grew. I saw birds and squirrels falling out of the trees and not moving when they hit the snow-covered ground. Pain streaked through my head and everything began to flicker. I saw black spots forming in my vision and I was certain I was going to pass out. The spots grew and grew as I sobbed and prayed for it all to stop. And then it did. The silence was only broken by the sound of my rapid heartbeat and the blood rushing in my head. 

As Gwen and I took our hands from our ears, I noticed the black spots were still plaguing my vision. I shook my head. The spots remained, but they were stationary. I looked down at the snow. No spots. I gazed outward again. There they were. Gwen mumbled something about her eyes. She saw them too. Ten of them. As we headed forward, we could see they were areas of space where the sky should have been. When I squinted, I could see stars twinkling inside. I was terrified.

We continued along the trail, our movements slowed by the four inches of snow that had made the path slippery. The sound exploded around us again. We clasped our hands to our ears and stared at the spots, which I then realized were holes. They leaked. Fluid drooled from them and poured out of their places in the sky in a thick, yellow line. Solid matter followed. Long strips of what looked like intestines or esophaguses fell straight down into the woods. The nearest hole, about a hundred yards from us, was leaving the trees draped with gore and viscous, yellow slime.

Again, silence replaced the din. But the activity in the bloody sky remained. The holes still leaked. Pieces of hard, solid material fell next, shattering when they hit the trees and taking branches and bark with them. Then skin. Flesh rained from  the holes and tangled itself in the remaining tree branches. After a minute, the grisly display ended. The stars inside the holes faded into nothingness and the holes themselves dissolved. The blue sky broke through its bloody mask.

Gwen and I walked in stunned silence. We were closing in on the spot where the vile matter had fallen. The smell was beyond all comprehension. We retched and tried not to breathe as we hurried by. It looked like a slaughterhouse had exploded and had been doused in thick, syrupy urine. After a minute, wed gotten by and were on clean snow again. But then we heard something that caused us to turn around. 

The material was moving on its own. It had animated into a whirling thundercloud of viscera and was funnelling itself into three spots on the ground. Each spot grew. In horror, I recognized the formation of small, humanoid shapes. In the distance, I could hear the same wet rustling. I knew the other nine locations had to be producing their own creatures. Ragged bone structures stood while jellied fluid coated their surfaces. Entrails wrapped around the bones and flesh enveloped it all. Sounds of skin-on-skin friction rose from the hideous bodies as the flesh tightened and gave features to the things. They all moaned in a quieter, but otherwise identical, sound to what had nearly deafened Gwen and me. Gwen pulled at my shirt and said we had to get out of here. But I needed to watch.

Two of the creatures, which I can only describe as looking like human toddlers, started to move. Before the production of the third one could finish, they attacked it. Its body was torn to shreds and consumed. As they ate, steam rose from their bodies and they grew larger as they metabolized and incorporated their siblings mass into their own. When theyd finished, two young adolescent girls stood in the gore of their birthplace. They looked at us, looked into the forest, and ran.

Gwen and I took a cue from them and moved as quickly as the trail conditions would allow. The moment we returned to our homes, we called 911. There was a brief investigation, many, many questions, and then nothing. Its been a week and neither of us have heard anything. No one else had called to report the sky conditions or the terrible sound. But I know what we saw. Ten holes, and if what happened with the one near us was what happened to the other nine, 20 children. 20 things. I have no idea what it all means.

<TEXT> Our grandfather was obsessed with safety. Whenever my brother and I went out, hed tell us to be careful and watch out for cars and slippery spots on the ground. If we were playing around the house, hed demand we keep an eye out for sharp corners on the coffee table or wires we might trip over. Even when we were going to bed, hed stand over us and warn about the dangers of our blankets getting wrapped around our necks. Hed demand that we listen to each other breathe if we ever woke up in the middle of the night. Just to make sure. 

To make matters worse, hed follow us in his pickup truck wherever we went, the loaded gun rack dissuading anyone from interfering with us. We could see him when we were in school, always parked outside, just in case anything might happen. As Reggie and I got older, we started to get tired of his nagging. We werent kids anymore. We didnt need to be coddled and watched over. 

When we turned 16, Reggie and I got a present very uncharacteristic of our safety-fetishing grandfather. Hed adopted two adult dogs. Twin brothers, just like me and Reg. They were Caucasian Ovcharkas; apparently the same breed he used to work with when he was stationed in Siberia, back before he and grandma moved to the States. Over the 11 years wed lived with him, wed never been allowed to go near any dogs. Even little ones. Theyll kill your brother, hed always say. The guilt wed feel from that statement would always get one of us to tell the other to leave the animal alone.

The Ovcharkas were truly enormous. Id never seen such massive dogs. They were both well over 200lbs and neither of them were overweight. When I leaned over and gave one a tentative pat, it felt like there was iron under the thick fur. Its tail didnt wag and it didnt look at me. Both animals just stared at grandpa. We were told their names were Mikhail and Sergey.

Reggie looked as uncomfortable as I felt. We thanked our grandfather for our gifts, but it was obvious we were unnerved. Grandpa asked us if we remembered the dog wed had before our parents had died. Neither of us did. He told us it was a beagle named Chair. A useless animal, he informed us. 

As our birthday dragged on, grandpa taught us how to care for the Ovcharkas. For the first few hours, theyd only listen to him. Whenever we spoke to them or even tried pushing them in the direction we wanted them to go, theyd wait for him to give the command before moving. By nighttime, though, the dogs had started to accept the commands from my brother and me. Their responses werent instantaneous, like they were with grandpa, but it was still progress. 

The next day, we realized why wed gotten our presents. The dogs were never to leave our sides. Rather than grandpa cautioning and watching us all day, every day, hed simply transferred his authority over to the animals. We were pissed. Reggie especially. Hed always been the more outspoken one, and, as a result, had most often incurred grandpas wrath. This time, though, Reggie wasnt slapped when he called the whole arrangement bullshit. Grandpa wrinkled his deeply-scarred face and yelled something in Russian. The dogs leapt at my brother. Reggie screamed and flailed, but the dogs had him on the ground in an instant. They stood over him, growling and frothing, until Grandpa yelled another word we didnt understand. They backed away and Reggie got up. He didnt complain anymore.

Since we were on summer vacation, we had a lot of downtime. Wherever we went, though, the dogs followed. Wed walk down the street with the two colossi in tow. Theyd growl at anyone who came near, whether it was at one of our friends who came up to say hello or at the cashier at the store who yelled that no dogs were allowed in the place. Anyone who presented even a hit of a potential threat was intimidated by the growling guard dogs. For Mikhail and Sergey, a potential threat was being within five feet of us.

On a hot day in early August, we were at the lake down the street. As usual, no one wanted to be near us because of the two wary, grumpy Ovcharkas. Reggie and I went swimming. The dogs, of course, swam alongside. Out of absolutely nowhere, there was a speed boat bearing down on us. Before anyone, dog or person, could react, Reggie was struck. The hull of the boat crushed his skull and the propeller tore through his skin like wet paper. The driver just kept going.

Reggies corpse floated face-up in the bloody water. His face was destroyed. One eye was completely missing while the other draped itself over his left cheek. From groin to chin, there was nothing but a gory channel the same diameter as the boats propeller. Tangles of his shredded intestines leaked their contents into the water. Mikhail and Sergey swam in silence, staring at his carcass.

I was beside myself with panic and rage. I screamed and tried to drag my brothers body toward the shore. As soon as I touched him, Sergey bit my arm. Hard. I let go of Reggie and hit the dog. He stopped biting. Again, I tried to move my brother. Another bite. This time, the dog pulled me away from Reggie while Mikhail swam in a circle around my brothers body. I felt my radius and ulna snap under the pressure of Sergeys jaw. I shrieked and started punching the animal. My assault did nothing to release the pressure.

Mikhails growl caught my attention. I felt it in my chest before I could hear it. I whirled around and saw something moving inside Reggie. No, not inside. All over. His skin was undulating and stretching while the bones underneath popped and crackled, as if they were all breaking. His ribs spread twice the width of his chest, some puncturing through the flesh as they went. The remains of his guts started slapping and flopping around like a net full of eels poured onto the deck of a fishing boat. A deep, resonant moan rose from the destroyed form of my brother.

I started to back away. This time, Sergey let me move. I swam backward while watching the unbelievable scene unfold. Both dogs watched Reggie while I stood on shore, overcome by fear and confusion. I felt a hand on my shoulder. I yelped and spun around to see the scarred face of my grandfather. Hed been following us again. He held a shotgun. On our sides, bathers were running from the lakeside toward the cars. Watch, grandpa instructed.

What I once knew as Reggie flailed and howled. The water, turbid from his unhuman thrashings, was pink and foamy from the release of his blood and other bodily fluids. His moaning intensified, causing me to cover my ears. I turned to run, but he held me by the back of my neck and wouldnt let me move. Watch, he hissed.

Reggie stopped moving. The dogs, whod been paddling close to him, barked furiously. Massive stalactites of bone began to erupt from the remains of my brother. As they burst through, the dogs attacked. They tore at the already-damaged flesh of the creature, ripping out thick chunks before pushing their faces in to get more. As they bit, the Reggie-creature moved toward us. As the water around it grew shallower, more of its body was revealed to us. It walked on five pillars of articulated bone; the segments joined by oozing, fatty tissue. It moved slowly, but deliberately. Bulbous, white eyes squeezed themselves from the cracked sockets of its skull. They rotated and then focused on my grandfather and me. He held me tighter.

As it walked, the dogs were tearing more and more of its body to shreds. Sergey attacked its legs. As the gristle and fat were pulled from between the segments, the creature slowed. Still, it didnt stop. An ossified spike shot from the rib-area of the monster, impaling Sergey through his chest. The dog was dead. Mikhail, in a renewed frenzy, tore the remaining connective tissue from the other four legs. By the time it had stopped moving, it was only ten feet away from us. Mikhail ripped the creature apart, spitting its bowels and meat from its bulbous eyes all over the sand. And then he stopped. Whatever Reggie had become was dead.

Grandpa let me go. Mikhail ambled over to Sergey and began to lick the mortal wound in his brothers chest. He whimpered and sat in the sand, panting. I sobbed as the pressure Id felt released. My grandfather slapped me and held my face in a vicegrip between his leathery palms. I stared at the deep latticework of scars covering his face.

I always thought it wouldve been you, he hissed. My grandfather made the same mistake with me. He traced the facial scars with his fingernail. Then he grabbed my broken arm, causing me to yelp. At least thisll heal.

I glanced over my shoulder. The remains of the monster had turned into a foul-smelling gelatin. Seabirds were diving and collecting it in their beaks before it could absorb into the sand. Those who managed to get a beakful died moments later, falling from the sky into the lake or on the sand.

I thought your father knew better, grandpa grunted as we walked. I didnt say anything. He kept mumbling in frustration when we got into the house. A fucking beagle, he murmured. I sat on the couch and cried.

<TEXT> When the little ghost first starting coming to me, he whispered nice things that made me feel good. 

*You have pretty hands.* 

*I love how you do your nails.*

*How did you get your skin to be so smooth?*

He stayed with me all day and all night. As the days went by, though, I must have done something to make the ghost angry. Instead of mawkish pleasantries, the messages grew negative.

*Ive seen other girls with prettier hands.*

*What happened to your nails?*

*Im sorry your skin looks so dry nowadays.*

I started to get upset. Id grown fond of the little ghost. Since hed always been so positive, it was comforting. But once he started to get mean, I wondered what Id done wrong. I didnt want my ghost to feel like Id disappointed him.

One night, as I was getting ready for bed, I saw the ghost in the mirror. He looked up at me as I brushed my teeth and said, with sadness in his voice, your cuticles are so ragged and ugly.

I looked down at my hands. He was right. I hadnt been taking care of them at all since I started that art class. Bits of skin and hangnails sprouted from each cuticle. They were red and angry.

Can you get rid of them for me? The ghost sounded so hopeful. I couldnt bear to make him feel like I wasnt the good person he initially believed me to be. What if he left?

I grabbed the corner of a thick hangnail on the side of my left middle finger. I started to pull backward. It hurt terribly. The ghost, his eyes brimming with hope, told me I was doing such a great job. Even through the pain of what I was doing, I was overwhelmed by relief. I was finally doing something right.

I kept working on the hangnail. After a little while, Id pulled a thin strip from the side of my finger, up my hand, and across my arm to the inside of my elbow. It stung terribly, but as tears of joy flooded from the ghosts eyes, I started to wonder if things were getting back to normal.

Your hand is looking a tiny bit better, the ghost informed me. Maybe someday you can be pretty again.

I spent the next hour tearing the skin and nails from my fingers. Even though they bled and I thought they looked terrible, the ghost smiled and assured me I had the hands of a beautiful angel. Through my tears, I smiled.

As the days went by, I did what I could to make the ghost happy. Sometimes, hed get in a bad mood. Just the other night, he told me the skin on my lips was ugly and chapped. I pulled the chapped skin away. Some of it went pretty far up my cheeks before it tore. But it was okay. The ghost talked on and on about how kissable Id become.

My parents arrived at my apartment this morning. They hadnt said they were coming, but it was a nice surprise. Itd been a while. But when they saw my face and my hands, they were horrified. My mom sobbed, what happened to your beautiful face? My dad, almost at the same time, exclaimed, oh my God your hands are ruined! 

Tears started to leak from my eyes. Off in the corner, my ghost sighed, theyre the ones who make us so sad, arent they? I agreed.

Ten minutes later, as I worked to saw their bodies into small parts, I asked the ghost if hed be happier now that they werent around. No answer. I turned around to see if he was listening. The little ghost was gone.

<TEXT> After the earthquake, we were trapped. We assumed rescue efforts were underway, but itd been three weeks. No one came. There was more than enough for us to drink, thanks to a burst pipe that trickled clean water through the ceiling. But that just meant we were dying more slowly. Starvation seemed imminent. 

Liz thought all the other floors of the hotel had to be right on top of us. All 60 of them. How the two of us managed to avoid being crushed seemed like a miracle. Well, at first it did. As the days dragged on, and we came to the gradual realization we might not get rescued, the miracle soured. After two weeks, it was more like a curse. 

We couldnt give up, though. I constantly coaxed Liz down from hysterics which, during their worst periods, had her threatening to slam her throat onto a jagged piece of rebar. Talking about Lena and Clair helped. If we were going to get out of this, theyd need their mom. Theyd need both of us.

Talk was cheap, though. No matter how much we held one another and cried, praying that the catharsis would diminish our agony, our stomachs growled. After the first week, Id started to grow dizzy. Had I not been sitting, I know I would have passed out. But we both sat and maintained an atrocious lucidity about where we were, what was happening, and how the likelihood of our escape was dwindling.

A few times, off in a distance blocked by hundreds of feet of concrete and steel debris, we heard the sounds of rescue equipment. Saws, bulldozers, all that. Not one voice, though. Thats how far inside we were. The day it happened, wed been getting on the elevator, which was in the center of the hotel. Once the quake started, it just shuddered and began to fall. Somehow, as the building swayed, the plunge of the elevator car was arrested by the angle of the shaft. We still came down very, very hard, but had it not been for that slight angle, no one would have survived. 

Since a couple days after the earthquake, the air had been growing ripe with the odor of putrefaction. I couldnt even begin to imagine how many people were dead in the rubble. The hotel seemed packed to the gills that day. Ill admit, I was jealous of those who were crushed and died instantly. I know Liz was, too.

Toward the end of the third week, our desperation had reached its peak. All Liz talked about was how shed abandoned the kids at home. She called herself a failure, even though she knew this whole, terrible thing was out of her control. It was only then that I broached the subject of Kevin.

I flicked my lighter, illuminating the carcass of our eldest son, who stood like a twisted, decaying scarecrow on the other side of the elevator. Hed been impaled and crushed when debris fell on top of the car after we hit bottom. I crawled over to his body and told Liz to close her eyes. I bit, spit into my palm, and moved back over to my wife.

Keep your eyes closed, I instructed, and think about getting home to Clair and Lena. In the dark of the elevator car, her sobs quieted as she chewed. I went back and got her more, as well as some for myself. The moment I heard her swallow the last piece, the rubble above us started to move. I was ready for the cave-in. Almost happy for it. Seconds later, we were blinded by a flashlight.

<TITLE> Cracks in the Foundation </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-29 03:18:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Things turned sour between my wife and I before we were married. Before our marriage was even recognized by our state, in fact. There was too much mistrust; too many incidents from our respective pasts had bubbled up to commandeer our attention. But we soldiered on. The gesture of our marriage, we agreed, was more important than the fraying of our bond.

As the months dragged on, we worked to rekindle the essential elements of our relationship. For the most part, we were successful. Janelles sharp edges, honed by the coarseness of our interactions over our most difficult times, began to dull. Mine, too, softened. For a while, things felt good. Comforting. Familiar.

Familiarity, though, would beget slothfulness. Its what Id worried would happen. Every night, when we were curled up together in our bed, Janelle would snore and Id be plagued by fear. It was the fear of inevitability. No matter how well things were going, once we got our wheels back in the familiar rut of our old routines, I knew our foundation would resume its inexorable deterioration. There was only so much damage it could endure before everything wed worked to build would topple.

We both felt pangs of stress before either of us articulated our concerns. Janelle started drinking again. She wouldnt stumble around drunkenly, but not a day went by when I didnt smell it on her breath. She made no attempt to hide it. I, too, regressed. I was overeating - just like how Id done before we met, when food was the only way I could escape the reality of my depression. When Janelle and I started our relationship, I was elated. My self-loathing melted away, taking 25lbs with it. But each time our connection felt like it was weakening, the first thing I turned to for comfort was junk food. Now I down a pint of ice cream every night while she polishes off a bottle of wine.

If it wasnt for our sex life, I think our relationship would have ended after our first fight. But I freely admit - were hedonists. We escape reality through physical gratification, whether its food for me, alcohol for her, or sex for us both. The pleasure we give one another has always purged the most toxic of the venom from our respective battle wounds. We both knew it was escapism. Neither of us cared. We needed to feel good and we had the ability to provoke that feeling in one another. 

This morning, we were sitting at the breakfast table and drinking our coffee. As Id always expected but never anticipated, Janelle announced her intention to leave me. I didnt say anything. I just stared into my coffee; the black liquid and the white mug defocusing and hazing as tears filled my eyes. I asked her if shed finally chosen Alana over me. She nodded and began to sob. We didnt talk much after that.

A few hours ago, as Janelle was packing, she came over to where I sitting and hugged me. She held me for a long time. I sat, motionless, doing my best not to bawl. But she wouldnt let go. I hated her. She kissed my cheek. My ear. My jawline. I felt warmth between my thighs. I hated my body. I turned and met her kisses. After less than a minute, we were undressed. Her tongue explored me and I writhed beneath her ministrations, despising her cowardice and antipathy toward our relationship while I clutched her head and ground against her mouth. I shuddered and saw flashes of our earlier life together as I came; my pleasure decaying into oversensitivity as I pulled her by the hair to stop her rough tongue from scraping over any more of me.

Janelles face wore a rictus of self-satisfaction and wanton lust. I could smell her arousal and knew it would be my only opportunity to finally give her what she needed. My final opportunity to get what I craved. I wasnt gentle with her. It was what shed always asked for but Id refused to provide. This last time, though, she could have it all. I scratched. Bit. Pulled her hair. She arched her back and mewled in mindless pleasure which only infuriated and further-motivated me. Mewls became moans. Moans became screams. And screams became gasps as her muscles tensed and she collapsed on the sofa, wide-eyed and sweating. She lay on her back, splayed, dripping, and utterly exposed. I kissed her forehead and watched, transfixed, as warmth drooled from her inviting slit. Throat.

<TITLE> Rats in the Barn </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was 19, I worked for a local exterminator. I wasnt licensed to use the chemicals, but I did inspections. A potential customer would call the company, theyd send me out to take some notes and pictures, give the property owner a quote, and my boss would come out and kill whatever little critters were causing a problem.

On a particularly busy day, I was scheduled to visit a barn on the far edge of some guys ranch thatd been infested with rats. Hed thought about demolishing it and starting over, but I guess there was some sentimental value because he and his dad built the place a while back. Didnt matter to me.

I was surprised by how big the barn was. Two full floors, also. The place was packed with old equipment, boxes, and whatnot. The owner said the rats were probably attracted to the grain crates thatd sat, unopened, for the last few decades. I told him he was probably right, then he went back to the house while I started looking around.

I went up to the loft first. There were a few droppings, but nothing that made me think of an infestation. It didnt look like anyone had been up to the loft in a while; lots of cobwebs and dust all over the place. I found a couple dead rats tucked into some corners. I took pictures and noted a few gnawed holes in the walls. When I turned back around to head back to the ladder, without any warning or straining sound, the floor below me collapsed. I fell right through, hit my leg on a tall crate, flipped over, and landed on my head.

For a minute, I thought Id broken my neck. Thankfully, I could wiggle everything that mattered, but I quickly realized Id broken my arm. To make it worse, I was wedged, upside down, between two crates. I squirmed and tried to fall to either side, but my pant leg was caught on a series of large splinters jutting out of a crate. The area was very, very tight. Dusty, too. It wasnt particularly dark, thanks to the barns big windows, but I was terribly uncomfortable.

Ive never been particularly claustrophobic, but not being able to move from my position was terrifying. My broken right arm throbbed and my left, because of the bizarre way Id landed, was pinned behind me. All I could move was my left leg, but only to kick pitifully at the crates. 

As the seconds ticked by, I started praying the rats wouldnt find me. I was fairly certain Id panic if they came. I began hollering for help, squirming pretty hard until I realized how it caused pain to explode through my broken arm. The homeowner didnt come. But the rats didnt, either. I tried to control my breathing; I was inhaling a lot of dust.

Once my breathing finally returned to normal, I tried to lean in different ways, hoping to dislodge my pants from the wood. Then I felt something which made me gasp. The arm that had twisted behind me, which had been prickling from pins and needles as a result the awful position it was in, was prickling for something else, too. Something was crawling on me. Immediately, I thought of rats swarming and biting my eyes out. I screamed and flailed as agony erupted from the compound fracture. I expected to see the rats any minute.

But I didnt. I saw spiders. Countless, brown, semi-translucent spiders about the size of my palm were swarming all over my arm and had begun crawling up my shirt. Soon, I felt them on my chest and neck. I screamed and screamed as I watched them skittering in the dirt around my face. I used what little movement I had in my head and neck to crush a couple with my temple and the side of my face, feeling their bodies burst against my skin. But it was useless. There must have been a hundred of them. And the action of killing those two caused the others to start biting.

Pairs of fangs sunk into my skin from the top of my head all the way to my navel. I spasmed with futile panic and a few of them lost their grip on my skin and fell down onto my face and neck. Each of my rasping inhalations before my shrieks forced more dust from the floor into my throat. I felt my tongue get coated with the desiccating stuff, forcing me to stop screaming and close my mouth to try to get enough saliva to spit. The second before I closed my mouth, one of the spiders pushed itself in. I gagged and retched but it remained inside. In fact, it went further back toward my throat.

I flopped my tongue around, trying to get it out. It didnt budge. So I bit down. The spider exploded in my mouth, coating my tongue and palate with thick, bitter fluid. I retched again, uncontrollably, while dragging my guts-coated tongue against the very dirt I was hoping to get rid of just moments before. 

Dirt and dust flooded my throat and lungs while I gasped and flailed. Over and over, the things bit me. The bites were coming fewer and further between, though. The infinitesimal consolation I felt was annihilated after I crushed another spider near my head, however. When I lifted my head from the carcass, tiny babies which must have been riding on its body fanned out all over my face. They crawled into my eyebrows and eyelashes before moving toward my nose. I screamed louder than Ive ever screamed in my life.

In groups of what must have been at least ten, the spider babies crawled into my nose to seek shelter. I flopped my body back and forth in abject, disbelieving terror. In my thrashing, I freed my trapped arm. Immediately, I jammed my fingers into my nose, trying to scrape the things out of me. Blood flowed as my fingernails destroyed the delicate membranes and I desperately blew dirt-caked snot from my sinuses. I could still feel them. Without thinking, I just starting banging my face into the ground. I felt my nose break immediately and the pain as I continued smashing it into the dirt was incomprehensible. 

I felt two hands grab me and pull. Shocked and surprised, I fought against them, striking the person in the groin as he pulled me out of the area where Id fallen. He yelped and dropped me on my broken arm. But I was free. I scrambled out, blood streaming from my nose, and saw it was the property owner. Hed come running once hed heard my loudest scream.

He grabbed me by the healthy arm and dragged me to the other side of the barn, where a hose was plugged into the wall. He turned it on and sprayed me with it while I stripped off my clothes. After a minute or two, all the spiders were out of my clothes and off my body. He called for an ambulance as I stood there, naked, directing the stream from the nozzle into my destroyed nose. The ambulance got there 20 minutes later.

I needed plastic surgery to fix my face. My arm took almost a full year to be back to normal. I quit my job at the exterminator from my hospital bed. They told me not to worry about it; Id already been fired. The barn owner had demanded they pay for the damage Id done to his loft.

**March 12, 2015**

*5:15pm*

As much as I thought I had to, I wasnt ready to go into the village just yet. There were things I needed to do back in the lab. Annie and Jared obviously arent healthy and Im worried about how safe they are around one another. I remembered GeneMedica had supplied us with three bottles of Laphroaig 30 to use in celebration if we had any breakthroughs. So, I did what any self-respecting scientist would do: got my fellow researchers blackout drunk and locked them in their respective rooms with a fresh bottle to call their own. 

Then I called Rakesh. He seemed more freaked out than I was. Hed known Jared for 20 years; apparently hes in a 25+ year monogamous relationship with his partner, and, to directly quote Rakesh, gayer than gayer than gay. Rakesh agreed with me that stranger things have happened than two people pairing off when stuck in a bad situation, but with everything else going on - the spore eruption, the skin lesions, the pain/pleasure rewiring, and whatever the hell was happening to the villagers - it was impossible to say it was just a situational fling. He commended me for figuring out how to keep Jared and Annie safe, then he told me to get my ass into the village and take notes.

I have a sinking feeling its going to be really, really ugly.

*Update @ 8:00pm*

Its hard to form a coherent narrative when youve been traumatized. At the same time, its easy to recall the details of that which traumatized you. The first things I noticed, upon leaving the lab and starting the 100-or-so yard walk to the village, were the bird feathers. They were raining from the trees and blowing in the weak wind. I couldnt make out much through the thick canopy, but I could see one bird very clearly. It was perched on a branch nearest the trunk and vigorously rubbing its body against the bark. Once one side was denuded of feathers, it started on the other until the same result was achieved. Then it leapt from the branch and flew in a bizarre, insect-like trajectory that didnt seem to be going anywhere in particular. It went out of sight before I could learn what was happening to it.   

A dog ran out from the general direction of the village and stopped in front of me. Its fur was mangy and the visible flesh was punctured or rotted away. Its tail wagged furiously and its ears were up, making it look incredibly happy despite the painful-looking condition of its skin. I reached out to pat its head, and it obliged, pushing its snout and head against my palm very hard; almost as if itd never felt the touch of a person before. 

It ground its skull against my hand and I felt something slide. I recoiled and pulled back. The skin stuck to my gloved hand as I pulled, tearing the fur and flesh from its head. The dog, with blood trickling down its face and its tail still wagging, stared at me and began to eat itself off my glove. I didnt shoo it away. I didnt know what to do at all, aside from continuing my walk to the circle of huts.

With each step, the details of the natives, who still swarmed in the center of their village, became apparent. I can only describe their activity as an orgy. Every conceivable pairing was demonstrated, all the way up groups as large of six. Most sickening to me, aside from the atrocious and seemingly-indiscriminate disparities in the ages of the participants, were the injuries. Every person had terrible damage to their skin. It appeared to be the same as what Annie and Jared are dealing with, but most of the villagers were much worse off; likely due to their constant and frenetic activity with one another.

They paid me no attention as I walked through their midst. Every so often, Id come across a corpse. Each had profoundly-disfiguring damage to them. While I know some of it was the result the fungal spores effect, a good portion was clearly from the action of another person. This was verified when I saw a young man in the crowd, a rictus of pleasure etched across his face, having his entire back flayed open by his partner. The man gasped with clear delight, his nudity making obvious the arousal he felt despite the terrible injury. His partner pressed his face into the wound and planted tender kissed on the exposed ribs.

There were more acts like that, but theyve all blurred together. Im exhausted and overwhelmed. I called Rakesh once I got back and while he expressed eympathy for what I saw, he insisted on the importance of documenting the behavior and progress of those affected by the spore cloud. I promised him Id do a better job tomorrow if I was able to get any sleep tonight. I checked on Annie and Jared; both were snoring. Their skin looked worse, though. Im not sure what to do. Rakesh assured me that by tomorrow evening theyll be able to get a helicopter to us. When I asked about where itd land, he told me not to worry about it. So Ill do my best. Im going to get drunk and try to fall asleep.

**March 13th, 2015**

*6:15am*

Before I went to sleep last night, I bound Jared and Annie to their beds. It was something Rakesh suggested and I eventually decided it would be for the best. I could deal with them being pissed at me as long as they didnt hurt themselves while we waited for the helicopter. Apparently ours would be the first of a few; theres a medical helicopter scheduled to come in minutes after were taken out. While Im really happy the villagers will get medical attention, it absolutely sucks so many of them will be either dead or terribly disfigured. If wed been able to figure out the workings of that massive underground fungus, we might have been able to prevent this from happening. 

Im heading down to the village again. Im bringing my voice recorder so I can document enough detail to make Rakesh happy. Im not going to transcribe it all, but Ill put what I feel are the most important parts in this journal. 

*Update @ 12:00pm*

What I saw yesterday was paradise when compared to the devastation and depravity I was forced to observe today. Rakesh, I wish you hadnt asked me to do this. I understand why you needed me to, but Im not the same person I was a few days ago as a result. Theres just nothing I can express other than sadness and terror. Well, maybe one thing. Theres a tiny, tiny bit of solace in the fact those affected by the spores dont appear to be in pain. But the other side of that is how they gleefully destroyed their fellow villagers. People who were entirely innocent. People who, even as I write this, continue to scream with impossible ecstasy as theyre torn apart. So Rakesh, you asked for details, so here. Choke on them.

* Woman, woman, man grouping. Severe skin deterioration among all three. Severe mutilation of the mans genitals. All that appears to remain is approximately 5 inches of his urethra, which is being stretched and pulled by both women. Each woman takes turns performing oral sex on the remains of the mans genitals. The smaller woman, when not occupied with the man, had created holes in the larger womans thighs, into which she thrusts her fingers and tongue. All participants in these acts express joy.

* Man, boy grouping. The dead man is on his back in the dirt while the boy sits in the gashed crater of the mans belly. The boy is laughing and pulling out loops of the mans intestines. Every so often, the boy will duck his head into the dead mans stomach cavity and move around, as if trying to swim. He then erupts upward, reminding me of a dolphin leaping out of the water, before settling back down in the belly of the dead man to repeat the process. Large bite marks are visible on the boys arms.

* Man, man, man, man, man grouping. Four men are having intercourse with gaping wounds in the torso of the fifth man. The fifth man is on his back on a small table, chewing on what appears to be the dismembered hand of a child. The child from whom he got the hand is not in sight.

* Woman, woman grouping. The women are engaged in mutual oral sex. Each womans belly has been torn out and is dangling her viscera either onto the dirt or onto her partners body. The woman closest to me is bleeding very badly and will not live much longer.

Side note: As these observations were made, I noticed a change in the surface of the spore victims skin. Aside from the growing blight of sores, the skin appears to be growing sticky. It also appears to be weakening. I watched a boy, whose back was relatively free from deterioration, get pushed back against a hut. When the boy moved forward, the skin stuck to the hut and tore from his body with each step. This is similar to what I experienced yesterday with the dogs head. 

* Man, man, woman grouping. The older woman is flaying all skin from the other two group participants. Both the flayed man and younger woman are sitting, apparently chatting happily, while the older woman removes their skin with a small knife. The scraps of flesh are being thrown both at the other groups of villagers and into the forest. This flesh is particularly tacky and is sticking like glue to whatever it strikes.

* Woman, man, woman, woman, infant grouping. The woman on the ground appears to be in the process of giving birth to what may have been a healthy, unaffected infant. The man and other two women are pushing the infant in and out of the mother with a great deal of force. I have no doubt the infant is no longer alive. All four living participants are either laughing or yelling with excitement or pleasure.

It was that sight which forced me back to the lab. Id reached my limit. When I walked in, Annie and Jared had escaped from their rooms. Once their flesh had deteriorated, it was not difficult for them to slip out of their bindings. I hadnt bothered to lock their bedroom doors after tying them up. 

They had resumed their intercourse from the day before. Jared was atop Annie, chest to chest. When I entered the lab, Jared, surprised and delighted to see me, lifted himself off Annie. Their skin clung together and the force of his motion tore the flesh from the muscles. Amused by this, Annie pulled back from Jared and attempted to disengage their genitals. Her vaginal walls clung to Jareds penis as she moved, sloughing off and separating from her anatomy. 

They stood in front of me, like they did yesterday, happy to talk about how much fun they were having. I couldnt stand to look at them. I asked if theyd kindly go back to their rooms and wait for a little while. Even though they looked confused, they listened to me. I locked them in. Thats when I began to write this entry. As I type, I can hear them moaning as they pleasure themselves. I dont know what Im going to do between now and the eight hours before the helicopter is supposed to arrive, but Im compelled to go into the forest and see if I can salvage anything useful from this horror show. Even if I dont see anything, maybe it can help clear my head.

*Update @ 6:00pm*

The first important thing I noticed was how the chunks of flesh thrown by woman who flayed her two partners had sprouted mushrooms. Small, stringy mushrooms. Everywhere I found chunks of flesh, I found the mushrooms. Also of note: the orgy of hideousness in the village had abruptly stopped. I hurried back to see what had happened. I thought at first they might all be dead, but they were standing there, smiling and wandering around aimlessly. Their injuries were horrific; some catastrophic. Those too hurt to move lay on the ground. The sticky flesh that had touched the dirt had begun to grow the same mushrooms.

Gradually, those capable of walking started to spread out in all directions. They moved slowly, picking their skin and throwing it on the ground as they walked. Over time, they increased their speed. I ran behind a group of boys. They pulled small strips of skin from their bodies and flung it to the dirt with each step. The bit off their own lips and tongues and spit them on the ground or at the trees. They ran and ran and ran, leaving a trail of gore behind them. I looked from side to side and saw the other villagers running and tearing themselves to shreds as they went.

I must have gone a few miles before I couldnt continue. The hazmat suit was too heavy and I was overheated and exhausted. I turned around and trudged back. The closer I got to town, the first few scraps of flesh that had been torn off had already started sprouting the same stringy mushrooms. I was overwhelmed with visceral disgust and scientific intrigue. Back in the village, no one was left alive. Whoever was capable of running away had done so, and all the corpses remained where theyd fallen or been dropped. Each of the carcasses were sprouting bouquets of fungus. 

Out of nowhere, I remembered Annie and Jared. I ran back to the lab, threw open their doors, and saw the consequences of being too late to help them. Both were dead. Theyd torn themselves to shreds and blanketed the bedrooms with their flesh and blood. With no dirt or plant life for the mushrooms to grow on, the flesh just sat there. Useless. I dont know why I did what I did next, but at the time, it felt like the only way to honor them.

I scooped up what I could of their remains and threw it on the ground by the lab. I sat and watched as the mushrooms grew. Now Im waiting for the helicopter.

---

Thats the end of the journal. The helicopter picked me up around 10pm. The other teams came in later to do whatever investigations needed to be done. Physically, I was fine. Aside from stewing in a sweaty hazmat suit for two days with a terrible cold and too few fluids, my body was no worse for wear. 

The bodies of the villagers were found over the course of the next few weeks. Some of them had made it almost 45 miles before their bodies gave out and they dropped. All that could be recovered were bones. 

Its almost a year later and Im back in the area with a new team. Having to wear a hazmat suit at all times when were not in the lab sucks, but no one wants to go through what happened to our colleagues. The research difficulties wed faced for the last ten years still plague us, but at least a few questions about the fungus have been answered. Still, when its quiet or Im working alone, I think about the villagers blindly running as far as their bodies would go, all while tearing themselves apart just so theyd fertilize the ground with the spores of that which had possessed them. And I cant stop thinking about how, because of it, a full five miles have been added to the radius of where that particular mushroom grows.

<TITLE> Slough, Part 1 of 2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-25 18:49:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the last three decades, small groups of mycologists have been visiting a village deep in the Brazilian Amazon. It is suspected, based on some evidence, the village is atop a colossal fungal colony, similar to the Armillaria solidipes in Malheur National Forest, Oregon, only dramatically larger. If thats the case, the fungus would be the largest living creature on Earth. 

The hundred-or-so expeditions before ours yielded inconclusive results. Genetic tests have shown there is a type of fungus unique to the general area, but attempts to grow it in any environment outside a 40-mile radius of the village have been futile. My trip down last March was with the intent of seeing if the fungus could be grown artificially under specific chemically-induced conditions. 

A biotechnology firm had recently developed an interest in that particular mushroom, believing it might have anticarcinogenic properties. As a result, the two members of my team and I were given far better equipment to take with us than we normally had. We were happy to oblige. When we arrived, the native people were as friendly and inquisitive as always. Theyd taken a liking to all the scientists whod visited them. While the lab was set up a hundred yards from the nearest structure in the village, it was common for the scientists and villagers to interact when the workday was over. A few of us even figured out a few words of their local dialect, although no one was anywhere near conversational level. It didnt matter, though. Food, drink, and wrestling were the common languages we spoke. And for 32 years, everything had gone well.

Everything, that is, except our research. Wed been stuck for the better part of a decade. With no ability to grow the fungus aside from that small, incredibly isolated locale, the likelihood of fully determining its properties was low. Further, without massively-invasive and destructive digging, wed never be able to find out the true size of the fungal colony below us.

Things became complicated, though. And they changed for the worse. Im not going to write out an explanation of what went on or why Im the only person in our group to survive the last trip, but I will share my journal entries from that period. I have to warn you, though: the things I saw were unlike anything I could have imagined. And theyre things I hope no one will ever have see again.

**March 9th, 2015**

*9:00am*

Its been absolutely pissing rain for six days now. Jared estimates the rainfall is exceptionally high, even for that time of the year. He thinks at least 20 inches have fallen. I believe him, too. I can see why the village folks have their huts elevated off the forest floor. Otherwise theyd be in knee-deep water. You know, sort of like our fucking lab. 

Ok, its not that bad in the lab. Maybe only ankle-deep. But I saw Im going to knock Franks teeth out when we get back home because it was his responsibility to make sure the place was sealed tight before his crew left. The dickhead.

Anyway, Annie said fuck it and hiked through the water to see if the trails had been flooded. They were. Big time. None of us are getting out of here for a while, so I hope no one gets hurt or sick. The place where the helicopter usually lands might as well be a lake and when its all drained away itll be 4 feet of mud. The sat-phones work fine, though, but when I called Rakesh, he just told us to suck it up and get some work done. The rain should be tapering off tomorrow. Well, as much as it tapers off in a rainforest I guess.

**March 10th, 2015**

*8:15am*

Well, the suns out. God DAMN theres a lot of water around. Thankfully, its draining into the ground pretty quickly. I guess thats one of the benefits of being on top of (maybe) the largest mushroom on Earth; mushrooms loooove their water. I cant even imagine how much that thing can hold. 

Yesterday, we laughed at Annie while she picked the leeches off her legs after her little hike. Well, we laughed until she starting throwing the nasty bastards at us. Then we just hid and giggled. Only in a rainforest are there so many leeches that youll get them even in water thats moving. 

We didnt do any work today. I think tomorrows going to be a good day, though. At the rate the waters draining, we should be clear to start getting new samples. Whenever it rains a lot, that big bastard underground sends up thousands of little mushroom caps that grow in less than four hours. Well have more than enough samples to play around with.

Side note, though: I think Im getting a cold. 

**March 11th, 2015**

*12:00pm*

I have a cold. You know how summer colds are the worst because the humidity makes the sinus pressure so much worse? Yeah, well a cold in a rainforest is about 1000x worse. Im sniffling and blowing snot all over the place while Jared and Annie are out doing field work and hanging out with the villagers. Being stuck in here gave me the time to do stupid Franks job and make sure the place was airtight, and after that was done, I had the opportunity to play with the cool toys from GeneMedica. That said, I dont even know what half this shit is. Were mycologists, guys. Not geneticists.

*Update @ 3:15pm*

Something started happening a little while ago and its definitely relevant to our work so Im going to do my best to detail everything. I called Rakesh and he agreed I should document it all. 

I was sitting at the computer and looking out the window when what looked like dark orange smoke started pouring from the ground. And I mean pouring. The visibility went to practically nothing. The tree thats about ten feet from our lab was nearly invisible. Outside, I can hear the villagers yelling to one another. They seem pretty frightened. Im unnerved, to say the least. Unnerved, but also excited. Is this a spore bloom? 

Im assuming it might be, and even though Im in the lab which I know is finally sealed properly, Im putting on my hazmat suit. Im probably being overcautious, and I know Annie and Jared are out in the stuff without any protection, but something about the ferocity of the way its coming out of the ground worries me. 

*Update @ 3:35pm*

Jared just came back. Well, hes still outside but hes at least back where I can see him. Hes acting like hes high out of his mind. Hes walking around and laughing to himself. Like, a lot. It doesnt look like hes having any problem breathing, but the amount of orange powder in the air and stuck to the surfaces of nearly everything is disconcerting. I cant imagine having that stuff in his lungs.

I yelled out to him about Annie and the folks in the village. He just yelled back how awesome they were. Theres no way Im getting through to him until his buzz wears off. It doesnt appear that he wants to come in the lab, and Im glad about that. I dont think itd be a smart move if the only mostly-clean area gets contaminated. 

*Update @ 7:15pm*

Annie came back and is in the same state as Jared. They played around outside like two kids and wouldnt listen to a word I yelled from the lab. Theyve since fallen asleep outside on the picnic table. Im going to bed.

**March 12, 2015**

*6:30am*

The spores (Im calling them that from now on because theres no other conceivable explanation) stopped coming out of the ground overnight and after it rained early this morning, theyve blended in with the mud. Im not taking off the hazmat suit, but Ive disconnected the breathing apparatus and just using the filters in the mask. I strongly doubt there will be any particulate matter small enough to penetrate the filters.

Jared and Annie seem to be no worse for wear, aside from exhaustion. After cleaning themselves in the river, I agreed they were probably fine to come back in the lab and sleep. As for me, even though Im miserable with this cold, Im too excited to stay in here. Im going out, first into the village, then to the forest around us. I want to see if that spore explosion could confirm the presence of that enormous mushroom.

*Update @ 10:20am*

I spent a little over an hour in the village. None of the people seemed injured, just a bit confused. Im concerned, however, about the skin irritation a few of them developed overnight. Annie, too, has red blotches on her back and stomach. She insists they dont hurt, but they look painful. They remind me of eczema. Jared, so far, isnt having any skin problems. Hes been coughing up disgusting orange crap from breathing in all the spores yesterday, but thats the worst of his problems. Im heading out into the forest for a few hours.

*Update @ 2:00pm*

My trip to the forest was unsettling. There were many, many injured animals. They appeared to be suffering from a skin condition similar to that of the people affected by the spore eruption. Im going into the village once more to see how their symptoms have progressed.

*Update @ 3:50pm*

I returned to the lab and found Annie and Jared having sex with one another in the middle of the main room. When I entered the lab, they didnt even try to hide themselves. They just continued doing what they were doing. That is entirely uncharacteristic of Annie, first of all, who is happily married and Jared, who, as far as I know, is gay. Neither of them ever appeared to have any romantic interest with one another and their interactions have always been professional. 

I approached them and they greeted me happily, but not even pausing their action. The blotches on Annies back looked much worse. As they went about their business, they talked to me about how much better they were feeling after getting some rest. Annie, who had been riding Jared chest-to-chest, leaned back and exposed her chest and stomach. The flesh was terribly damaged. Jared, too, had started to show signs of skin deterioration. His own chest and belly were riddled with ugly, red, eczematous patches. 

When I asked if theyd be okay with stopping for a few minutes so I could take a look at their skin, they didnt argue. Annie hopped off Jared and they stood in front of me, naked and beaming. I have no medical training, but I thought it was important to get samples of their damaged tissue. While Id never done a biopsy before, they didnt look hard and Jared and Annie consented. 

I made the first cut on Annie. As the knife went in, when I expected to hear a gasp from pain, she groaned with what I could only identify as pleasure. I glanced up and saw her with her head back, smiling. I took the sample, bagged it, and put it in the refrigerator. Jared, too, expressed delight at the feeling of the scalpel sliding into him, his pleasure manifesting itself more obviously as he regained the erection hed lost following his interrupted sex with Annie. I did my best to stay professional, but I was very, very disturbed.

I put his sample in the fridge next to Annies. When I turned back around, I was horrified by what I saw. Annie and Jared were kissing again, and rather than resuming their intercourse, she had invaginated his navel with her index and middle fingers. She slid them in and out of his abdomen, blood trickling through his public hair to the base of his erection, and dripping onto the white floor. All the while, as they kissed, both their faces shone with ecstatic glee.

Feeling sick to my stomach, I backed away and walked outside. From the village, I heard screams of rapturous joy. Many of the villagers had congregated in the center of the main huts. They were all nude and writhing against one another. Men. Women. Children. And bright blood glinted off their dark skin.

[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3yues6/part_7_i_was_diagnosed_with_childhood/)

My name is Joy. My brother, James, whose account youve been reading over the last couple months, asked me to contribute this portion of his story before I die because he has no memory of the events Im about to describe. I feel strange having to narrate a period of time that might as well never have happened for him. My concern, which Ive articulated to him as best I could, is that Ill give skewed depictions of the time he was gone. He told me it was better than nothing.

Since I wasnt even a year old when James disappeared, I dont remember him being in my life. I grew up with our late aunt, Emma, and had a happy, albeit lonely, childhood. She homeschooled me and helped me understand how certain members of our family, herself included, had the ability to perceive things others couldnt. Sometimes those perceptions manifested themselves as visions, sometimes as sounds. Tastes and smells, too. Rarely, like in the case of my brother, the perceptions could be detected by all their senses. She hadnt told any of that to the police, who, after James seemingly evaporated into thin air, scoured the property and surrounding areas for weeks before officially declaring him gone.

Thats what she told me, at least. I was way too young to know about any of it. Still, I grew up in the house with his pictures decorating the mantles, along with photographs of our parents, who were also dead. Emma was the only family I knew. I hate how it sounds like Im making this all about me, but its pretty important to have some background - especially in the face of what happened.

Emma died on my 20th birthday. She left me an incredible amount of money. Far more than I knew she was worth. It allowed me to embrace the new sights and sounds in my life without any financial hindrances or any other obligations. I had no doubt they were real. And the day James came back, I told him about it all. 

I watched his small face as he listened the woman who, to him, was his infant sister just a few subjective hours ago. Emma had always talked about how intelligent he was, but back then I only could understand it as an abstraction. That day, though, as I saw him process everything I told him, I was struck by his perspicacity. Hed not only accepted the fact that hed somehow traveled nearly 20 years without aging a day, but as I spoke to him about the things Id seen, he actually believed me. Empathized, even. But then I mentioned the white man.

I started seeing the white man when I was six. He never wore clothes, he never spoke, and he never did anything except follow me. But Emma couldnt see him. She didnt deny his existence, though. Whenever I mentioned him, she always said there had to be some purpose for him in my life, but I hadnt gotten to the point where that purpose could be actualized. 

As I grew older, he changed. At first, I was terrified. His skin began to drop off; first in small flakes which whirled around him whenever the wind blew. Later, the flesh began to slough from his muscles. It collected in baggy folds around his wrists, hips, and ankles. That which fell from him entirely sat where it was dropped, decaying over the months with no hint of odor or material presence. The process took years. When I was 11, the house was littered with rotting flesh. It was just part of my life.

Here, James interjected. He told me about the black woman. He mentioned how he could touch her; how she spoke and gave him comfort; how she protected him. As he spoke, his eyes kept darting around the room. I knew he was seeing things, but I wouldnt ask what. In time, if he wanted to tell me, he could.

I went on, filling him in about the white mans place in my life. By the time Id reached 17, he was hardly a man anymore. While Id expected him to decay like a normal corpse and leave behind a desiccated heap of skeletal remnants, the white man grew soft and wet. It was almost as if his bone structure had grown gelatinous. He could no longer move like a bipedal human, but like a fat, wriggling larva. While I still thought of him as the white man, he no longer resembled either. He was blood red and streaked with purple veins. Chunks of yellow matter which had to be fat clung to portions of his body, remaining unsettlingly stiff as the rest of him moved through peristaltic heaves. If anything, he looked like a disembodied organ. A stomach, maybe. It was the form he occupied for the next few years.

One year before James came back, the white man changed again. And so did I. For the first time in my life, I could hear him. He whispered wet, rasping seductions I found both nauseating and intoxicating. His shape, still that of viscera, began to extrude tentacles. No, not tentacles. Intestinal tubes. They grew quickly and soon crisscrossed the house in an elaborate transitway of bowels. Part of me was surprised I wasnt revolted or frightened by my home being overtaken by what looked like a surrealists nightmare of an abattoir. 

James interrupted again at that point, telling me he could see them. Its what hed been watching as we talked. And he wanted to know why the thickest one was connected to my mouth.

Its the part Id wanted so desperately to bring up. Its what Id been so excited to mention to someone who finally would understand. My own, beautiful brother would be the one whod share in my elation.

Shortly after the white man finished growing his tentacles, about 8 months earlier, he did something else entirely new. He didnt follow me around anymore. Instead, he floated above my bed. It was there hed whisper to me about my great potential. About how, if I stopped eating, hed give me all the food I needed. And he did. Every night, with his intestinal tube snugly down my throat, I watched as portions of jellied fluids trickled through its translucent skin and disappeared into me. I felt none of it, but I knew I was being nourished. I felt incredible. And when I woke up every morning, the feeling remained. 

I lost interest in my friends. They never could understand what I was accomplishing with the white man. Why even bother telling them? I lose weight quickly, but I didnt care. It felt like I was making room for something great. Something bigger than myself.

While Id hoped James would be appreciative about what Id seen and experienced, he surprised me by expressing fear and worry. For the first time, I felt anger toward him. Of all the people Id met, it was he who should have recognized the beauty of my relationship with the white man. His description of the black woman sounded no different to me. Yes, the shapes and forms of the white man and the black woman were dissimilar, but surely there was enough of a connection between the two of them for James to feel comfort, rather than fear. 

I was devastated. And as I write this, I remember the venom in the betrayal I felt. If Id realized the reason for his fear was his countless experiences with incomprehensible, otherworldly atrocities, so much could have been saved. Maybe even my life. And while Im happy I had a chance to meet my brother and spend the last ten years watching him grow and overcome so much, I wish he never came back to see what Id initiated. 

My remaining time is short. I only hope James will remember me as someone who tried to do her best in the face of overwhelming evil. Still, I fear the worst. And while I doubt Ill live long enough to read the remaining parts of his memoir, Id rather die thinking hell write about the adult me in a positive light, rather than as a pathetic girl who was seduced into the actualization of her hideous purpose.

<TEXT> **July 5th, 2015**

I cant believe how long its taking. Yeah, I get it, things that ship from China are going to take longer to get to Rhode Island than if they shipped from Canada. IDC. I paid so much money for this shit Id expect the people who sell it to actually care about their customers. Such bullshit.

The tracking info says its in fucking Rotterdam. I thought it was going to be flown over here because it needs to be refrigerated. If its just sitting in a hot cargo ship next to baby clothes and ballpoint pens and dildos Im going to be so mad. $155!

**July 6th, 2015**

So fucking pissed. Its going to be another week. I sent an email to the company and they got back real quick and told me, yes, its refrigerated and, yes, it will be perfect when it arrives. But I have to wait SEVEN MORE FUCKING DAYS. Thats cutting it so super close to Carlottas wedding and I need my skin to be PERFECT for all those pictures. Im not going to look worse than my sister, even if shes bride. I want people to look at her wedding pictures and be like, yeah Carlottas beautiful but Rachel is the one in the family with the looks. Because I am.

**July 10th, 2015**

Another three days of waiting. My skin is AWFUL. I dont have a ton of zits but the ones I have are huge and they dont just look gross but they hurt. None of the stuff Ive gotten at the store works. Yesterday, I went to Whole Foods and found some natural coconut oil cream that people online said was good. I put it on last night and this morning I woke up with another massive pimple right in the left corner of my nose. I did a test with my camera and I stood 15 feet away like how the photos will be taken for the wedding. The pimples were so obvious. Even with makeup, you can see them underneath. Especially if one starts leaking. So fucking gross. Im so mad.

**July 12th, 2015**

ITS HERE ITS EARLY THANK GOD! 

The package came in a really well-sealed box that looked like it had some weird refrigeration packs inside. It was definitely cold. The acne cream was in a clear tube. The stuff looked almost exactly like the Neutrogena scrub I use every day but instead of being blue with gray exfoliating beads, the Chinese stuff was yellow with white exfoliating beads. I have no idea what the writing on the tube says but Im texting a pic to Mei so she can translate.

*Update @ 11:25am*

Ok, Mei said the writing just says skin care and for use on blemishes. The instructions say: Keep refrigerated, use a thumbprint-sized dollop on the face immediately after getting out of a hot shower, let sit for a half hour, then rinse off with warm water. For best results, use twice a day for one week. Mild swelling may occur, but it is normal. If severe peeling occurs, stop using immediately. 

I jumped in the shower and turned it as hot as I could stand so my pores would open up. I squeezed the pimples that were ready to blow and almost threw up when the biggest one popped so hard i heard the glob of pus hit the shower wall. That one bled a lot. I hope the new acne cream wont sting too badly.

I got the cream out of the little dorm fridge I keep in my room and started to spread it on my face. It stung SO BAD. I thought it smelled pretty good, though. Reminded me of Meis moms perfume, although there was something weird in the background. Not chemicals, either. Just...weird. Whatevs. I left it on for a half hour like it said, washed it off, and went to work.

*Update @ 10:50pm*

Work sucked as usual. My face felt nice, though. The stinging went away pretty quick after I scrubbed the stuff off and my skin feels smooth. Definitely less greasy. I could see in the mirror at work that my pores were a bit larger than normal. But they didnt look or feel oily. The blackheads were gone, too. So far, so good.

I got home and took another hot shower and put on the stuff. I rubbed the exfoliating beads over the worst of the remaining zits, hoping to erode them down. One of them popped and hit the mirror like a mashed potato javelin (Im working on my similes for English 102 next semester) and the cream stung like crazy when it touched the open sore. I gritted my teeth and rubbed the beads across the bleeding crater, working them into the skin to bring down the edges.

After a half hour, I cleaned it off and went to bed.

**July 13th, 2015**

My face looked SO MUCH BETTER this morning. The big pimples are still there but I can tell theyre starting to shrink. None of them have whiteheads. The skins a little swollen and feels hot, though. Im glad the creams still working even after its been washed off.

Ive got a lot more confidence today even though my face still is way worse than I want it to be for the wedding. Ive gotta go to work now but damn it feels good to not want to cut my stupid skin out of my head. 

*Update @ 10:30pm*

Apparently the cream helped me grow some balls because I asked out Todd from the deli department. Ive wanted to fuck that dude for two years. Im so going to, too.

**July 14th, 2015**

Last night after I showered and did my face, I started peeling a little bit. Im not too worried because all the acne stuff in the past that stung going on always made me peel later on. Ill keep an eye on it just to make sure it doesnt get really bad, but I cant believe how happy I am with how well its working. I take back everything I said about that company and the Chinese people in general. Im glad Mei hadnt heard me. Jeez.

*Update @ 9:19pm*

Todd looked so good at work today. I cant wait until we can go out next weekend. Mei came in to see me and I pointed him out and I think he noticed but he didnt say anything. She agreed hes hot as fuck. She told me if I didnt hit that this weekend shed be on him an hour later. No way shed have that chance lol. 

My face feels pretty okay but its definitely more swollen than Im used to. The biggest pimples are almost all gone, though. I dare say my complexion looks almost GOOD for the first time in 10 years. Jesus, Ive gone from 12 to 22 with fucked up skin. No wonder Im such an asshole. Oh wait, Ive always been an asshole lol.

**July 15th, 2015**

My skin is smoooooooooooth! Its not peeling anymore and even though its still swollen and the pores look way big, Ive got no new pimples. Not one. Hasnt even been half a week. Ill be recommending this stuff to everyone once the treatment is finished and Im in the wedding pictures looking like a total goddess. Youre so screwed, Carlotta lol.

**July 16th, 2015**

Nah, nothing. Same ol shit.

**July 17th, 2015**

Face is smooth as a babys buttcheeks. Still swollen, still big-ass pores, but not a single zit. Two more days of my skin treatment, five more days until date night with Todd, and eight more days until the wedding. Things are pretty damn good right now.

**July 18th, 2015**

Tomorrows my last day of the acne cream. I started peeling again just a little bit, but everything is still pretty damn smooth. I used the exfoliating beads in the cream to get off the majority of the peeling skin, anyway, and I dont think anyone but me noticed. That said, my housemate said something about my cheeks being swollen and I told her it was just my acne meds. She nodded and said I might want to stop using it. I just laughed and told her Id be stopping it tomorrow anyway. 

After Olivia mentioned that, though, Ive become pretty aware of the swelling. I can feel it when I smile and furrow my brow. When I poke my cheeks, theyre still smooth but they feel a little hard underneath, kinda like my ankle did when I sprained it and it swelled up. Ill write the company tomorrow after I finish with the cream.

**July 19th, 2015**

Done! Today was boring as fuck cause thats how I roll but I just finished my last application of the acne medicine. I just looked at the before pic I took of myself the day before I started, and its RIDICULOUS how much better I look. I was fucking HIDEOUS last week! Omg. Yeah, my face is a lot rounder and stuff right now but its clear and smooth and TOTALLY awesome for the wedding AND my date with Todd. This is going to be awesome.

Im writing an email to the Chinese company about the swelling just to put my mind at ease. I think it might have gotten a tiny bit better overnight but I really cant tell. Neither could Olivia. Ill ask some of the people at work later how it looks to them.

**July 20th, 2015**

Holy shit Todd texted and wanted to see if I could go out with him tonight instead of when wed planned because something came up. Ive just spent the last hour showering and shaving every hair below my eyebrows. I have to admit, Im a little self-conscious about the swelling in my face. When I got out of the shower, I pressed on one of the larger pores near my nose and one of the damn exfoliating beads came out. That made me worry. Id pushed those beads in pretty hard when trying to get the flaky skin to go away. The last thing I wanted to deal with was an infection. Everything Id read about those was how bad they are for the environment. They cant be good if theyre trapped inside your skin.

Im going to go on our date and maybe tomorrow Ill go to the walk-in clinic just to get looked at. It really doesnt hurt much and I pressed on a couple other pores and got more of the beads out. There wasnt any blood or any gross pus or anything else that would make me think my face was infected, so its probably fine. Whatevs. Im getting dick tonight.

**August 13th, 2015**

Im in the hospital. And fuck it, Im going to write what happened because I missed the wedding and Todd thinks Im a freak and Ive got nothing else going for me but this story. And Todd told everyone already. Im done for.

The first part of our date went so well. Dinner, drinks, then a romp at my place. I was riding him and leaning forward and sucking his tongue when my face started to hurt REAL bad and he opened his eyes and yelled. Then he threw me off him and ran out the door with his clothes in his arms. My skin hurt so bad I could hardly breathe but I got up and ran into the bathroom. I almost died.

My pores had erupted with thin, white worms. And they were still coming out. Each pore released a few cracked exfoliating beads. No, not beads, I realized. Eggs. As each broken egg came out, a thin, pure white worm slithered out behind it. They slid and dangled eight inches out of my face. I screamed as I grabbed a handful of them and pulled. Hard. I felt them stretching out of my pores from deep inside my head. From behind my neck. From my scalp. I reached arms length and they were still in me. I dropped what I held in the sink and used both hands to frantically yank the things out. 

As I pulled, they curled up in the sink like vermicelli noodles. Finally, after what must have been five feet of length, that group was out. My pores oozed gray and yellow pus that smelled worse than anything Id ever encountered. It was then I understood what the underlying smell of the acne cream had been. I vomited into the sink as I kept pulling, but more of their bodies poked out of the pores.

I ran out of my bathroom, feeling the things slapping against my neck and naked chest as I scrambled to find my cellphone. I could see them dangling when I reached down for the phone. And theyd started to move. No longer did they just slide out, but they wriggled and thrashed, finally sensing they were in some sort of danger. I screamed over and over and eventually was able to dial 911. Somehow they were able to get my address from the cell phone data and they said an ambulance would be there ASAP.

While I waited, I stood in my kitchen, puking and crying, snipping the things out of my face with a pair of scissors. They squirmed over the linoleum, dripping the same yellow and gray pus that was squirting from each gaping pore. As a new crop of worms, fatter than Id seen so far, started to crawl out from underneath my left eyelid, I knew I was losing my mind. And I did what anyone who loses touch with reality does: I carved underneath the eyelid with the scissors. Immediately, everything in the room blurred and lost some level of dimensional perspective. I shrieked as the pain of the injury exploded through me, but I couldnt stop.

I snipped down the eyelid, down my cheek, and unzipped the side of my face. I took my fingernails and dragged them under and through the incision, feeling unwound masses of the things buried within the muscle. I pulled and pulled, not feeling any more pain, and I watched the blurry, blood-soaked bodies drop to the kitchen floor with a wet sound. 

Some time later, my door was being kicked in and I saw firefighters and EMTs staring at me in abject horror. I said something like, be careful, theres worms in my face before I fell forward and cracked my head on the counter.

Two weeks later, I woke up. I wasnt allowed to see my face for another few days, either. I could tell I was really messed up but apparently Id be fine aside from some pretty bad scars and a damaged eye. The doctors had no idea what kind of parasite was in me, but said theyll be taking the rest of the acne cream to run tests on it. They said that while it was refrigerated, the eggs would have been dormant. They figured once they got into the steamy humidity of my skin, they were able to gestate. And gestate they did.

Once Carlotta learned Id survive the whole thing, she went and had the wedding anyway. And she had a great time. The wedding pictures were in an email attachment I got after I woke up. She looked amazing. Most gorgeous woman at the place. Before her email, though, was another one. The mail I sent to the Chinese company about my facial swelling had bounced back. No such recipient.

Fuck everything.

<TEXT> Shell be here soon. 

I collected the amniotic fluid in a glass jar as it was expelled. Oily swirls of yellow and red and brown danced across the wet surface. Just a sip. Just one for now.

The fluid caressed the back of my undeserving throat and left a sheen of grease on my tongue. The flavor of that which bathed Her would remain in my mouth for hours. More than long enough for me to lay my eyes upon Her entry into this world.

The container screamed as paroxysmal thrashing tore through its legs, hips, and back. I trembled with uncontrollable anticipation, vaguely noticing the warm spread of urine growing on the front of my pants. I had no doubt She wouldnt mind. She would be so far beyond such pitiful, corporeal shame.

Steam poured from the swollen body of the container. The humidity clung to the windows where it froze in crystalline fractals. The perversity of the spontaneous order filled me with rage. That such blasphemy would arise in the room in which She would be born reeked of mockery. Of eutaxiological hubris. I seethed.

The screams from the container continued until its vocal cords gave out. It babbled and belched its indications of pain; apparently indignant to the end. Its end. Her beginning.

I opened the door of the small cabin. Frigid air rushed into the room and froze the containers steam into rime. I gazed up at the hideous sky. White blemishes pockmarked the pitch blackness like acne. Like smallpox. Tears froze on my cheeks as I imagined each dot of white shifting to red. Then to black. Countless dots of fire raped out of existence. And each of those rapes will bear fruit.

The container bit through its teeth with a crunching sound that snapped me from my reverie. My frozen pants cracked as I turned and walked back in the containers direction. I peered into the area through which She would soon travel. The passage was engorged with the containers blood and slickened by its mucous. The lubrication would be of little use in easing the passage of Her form. 

The container shuddered and cracking sounds filled the room as its hips shattered into collagen and calcium shrapnel. Each rope supporting it groaned under new tension. Blood began to drool from its orifices. It was happening.

Two feet emerged from the container. Then two sturdy legs. The containers flesh began to tear as more of Her bulk emerged. Her flesh was a gelid blue. I shivered as I began to register the magnitude of what I was seeing. A stench filled the cabin as the bowels of the container gave out and spilled their contents onto the dirt floor. I hardly noticed. My fixation remained on Her. More was emerging.

Both legs were out and Her hips had finally burst free. I stared through my tears. Undeniably a she. It was Her. I had no doubt. Torso followed hips. Shoulders followed torso. She hung by Her neck from the devastated caldera of Her containers pelvis. Two perfectly-formed hands reached up and tore the remaining tissue away. She fell into the dirt and filth.

I carefully picked Her up and held Her to my chest. She began to nurse immediately. The flesh of Her body was impossibly cold. Incomprehensibly cold. It was the cold that She and Her 23 Sisters would use to rape the fire from every star. Cold that would, after countless eons of decadence and order, grind it all to a halt. And so would begin Her reign.

Through the numbing chill of Her touch, I felt Her teeth chew on my left breast. In the span of minutes, Shed already consumed the right. I savored the glaze of amniotic film on my tongue as I watched Her use me. All that was left for me to do was finish recording my experiences and continue to fulfill my purpose. Soon, Ill be inside Her. And She will be ready for the world.

<TITLE> After 20 years, my wife finally allowed me to tell this story. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-15 22:02:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Like all good stories, this one begins with a testicle self-examination. Or, as its colloquially known: jerking off. It was my last day in Guatemala and I was sitting in the hotel, waiting to go to the airport, and abusing myself to help pass the time. Things were going as well as could be expected. Until they werent. My left middle finger brushed against a lump on my right testicle. My erection wilted like a primrose at Chernobyl.

I did a cursory examination, hoping it might be an ingrown hair. But I knew it wasnt. It didnt have the itchy pain of an ingrown hair. No pain at all, actually. It had all the telltale signs of a growth I absolutely did *not* want *anywhere* on my body, especially not on my balls. Within 20 minutes, Id cancelled my flight, phoned Renee to tell her the flight was delayed, and called an emergency clinic to tell them I was on my way.

Fast forward eight hours. Interesting fact about Guatemala: great medical care! I was examined, given an ultrasound, and told, to my enormous relief, the growth was benign. Just a cluster of fatty deposits. Itd go away on its own in a few weeks. I was on the next flight home.

I got back to my house around 10pm. Itd been almost two months since I saw my wife. Needless to say, we were both happy to see each other. I took a shower, scrubbed out the nooks and crannies, and did a bit of manscaping. The lump that had caused me so much stress only 24 hours earlier had already started to dissipate. There was a pretty good chance Renee wouldnt even notice. I finished the process of making myself smell moderately fuckable, dried off, and headed into the bedroom. 

Renee was waiting for me on the bed. I could tell when I got home that there was a decent chance wed be having a bit of fun. And I was right. Ill spare you the details, but it all went according to our tried-and-true routine: upper-front pinching, lower-front nibbling, lower-rear licking, mouth-to-mouth slobbering, and genitals-to-genitals docking. Four thrusts later and I was wheezing sorry, its been a while into her ear and collapsing on top of her.

I could tell Renee was stifling a laugh when she told me not to worry about it. I rolled off her and stared at the ceiling, panting like a chain-smoking Golden Retriever. While I watched the rotation of the ceiling fan and silently wished I didnt have the refractory period of a glacier, I started to get itchy in a remarkably unpleasant spot. Were all adults here, right? Okay, well, for lack of a better way of putting it, the tip of my dick felt like it was getting molested by a poison ivy plant. I started scratching, trying not to make too much of the irritation. Renee, of course, noticed immediately. She started giggling and began to ask are you seriously jer Then she stopped and winced a little.

You okay?, I inquired, doing my best to wipe our combined goo off my hand without my wife noticing I was wiping it on her side of the bed. Yeah, she told me. Just dry skin or something. You almost ready for round two?

Sure, I told her, lying through my teeth. Ill be right back.
I got up and stumbled my way through the dark bedroom into the bathroom to hopefully pee away the growing discomfort. Once in the bathroom, I stood in front of the toilet, mildly disturbed by the way the dim glow of the night light cast a shadow on the wall and made it look like I had a truly spectacular pair of breasts. Peeing helped the itching go away - for a second or two. Then it came back with a vengeance; not just on the tip, but all over the area. I gritted my teeth and leaned over to turn on the light. Then I screamed.

A sea of tiny, brown spiders swarmed over my penis, the front of my testicles, and my left hand thatd been holding on while I peed. I screamed again and squeezed myself, crushing the tiny things in my fist and pulling them away from me. Renee, whod leapt from the bed after my first shriek, saw what was happening and gasped. I looked at her crotch and almost passed out. Hundreds, maybe even thousands, of the things were leaking out of her and cascading down her right thigh. She hadnt noticed yet.

Pain, now, not just itching, exploded from my urethra as another wave of the arachnids pushed themselves out of me; their journey no longer aided by the lubrication that had eased the passage of the first group. Renee finally discovered her own condition and split my ears with a shriek I was certain wouldve shattered the windows. She reached in with her fingers and pulled globs of writhing baby spiders, still trapped in the sticky confines of what Id left following my profoundly disappointing attempt at sexual intercourse.

I jumped into the freezing cold shower and tried to aim a needle of the shower water into the spot where the baby spiders kept pouring from. Renee ran out of the bathroom but I didnt follow. I had my own problems. Gradually, over the course of a couple minutes, the spiders stopped coming out. I turned off the water and ran to find my wife. All I had to do was follow the drops of semen-trapped baby spiders. I found Renee in the kitchen, her right leg up on the counter, attempting to dredge the remaining creatures from her anatomy with the hose next to the sink. She glared at me. The floor was soaked, but I figured it wasnt a good time for me to tell her that. She probably knew.

I offered to help, but she just told me to leave her alone. Another few spiders crawled out of my tiny, flaccid penis. I asked if she was sure. She told me she was.

An hour later, after the last of the arachnids were purged from our respective anatomies, we got in the car and went to the hospital. Renee wasnt very happy. It was a pretty long ride and we sat in silence, doing our best to forget what had happened. We werent very successful. I felt terrible and tried to add some levity to the situation. So, um, remember when all those spiders came out of my dick?, I asked, and nudged her. She snorted out an unexpected laugh and just said, I fucking hate you right now.

We left the hospital after 12 hours of ultrasounds, X-rays, and hundreds of questions from every doctor in the place. Apparently a spider egg cluster can look *just* like a fatty deposit on an old ultrasound. The same old ultrasounds they used in Guatemala. No one could explain exactly how the spider egg had gotten there, but the doctors said weirder things have happened. Neither of us were particularly comforted by that fact. 

After we each got a clean bill of health and five free bouquets of flowers from the hospital florist, who told us every single person who worked at the hospital knew about what had happened, we went home. And that was that. We were finding cobwebs all over the house for almost ten years after, though. Memories.

<TITLE> Fertility Treatments </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-13 23:42:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They told me when I was pretty young that Id never be able to have a baby. And that was that. No therapy, no consolation, no nothing. I was given the knowledge and left to my own devices to deal with it. They wouldnt have to see me crying at night. Every night. For years and years. I kept it all under wraps, despite hating myself inside. Hating my failure. Hating my parts that didnt work. Hating the jealousy I felt for the women who had that gift and squandered it. I needed to try something. Anything. 

It didnt take long before I was ordering fertility drugs online. Diethylstilbestrol. Clomiphene. GnRH. I took them all. Then I had to get sperm. A few quick ads on Craigslist, a couple pictures sent back and forth, and a meet up. An hour later, Id have a condom full of what I needed. 

I gave the drugs a week to kick in before doing anything else. They made me dizzy and nauseous. It was a small price to pay, I guess, and less invasive than my next task, which was to inject the sperm into myself. I had to try lots of spots; I was aiming for where I thought ovaries would be. I figured an ectopic pregnancy was still a pregnancy. And maybe the doctors could fix it if I was lucky enough to encounter that problem in the first place. 

In the time that passed between my self-medicating and material gathering, Id find myself drifting off to sleep and imagining a baby - my baby - warm and soft in my lap. A little bundle of warmth capable of melting the impossibly-cold center of my being. Of my identity. A precious life who would love me as much as I loved him or her. My hands would travel over my belly and Id dream of a life growing inside. I swear, I could almost feel the kick.

Waking from those dreams brought both a renewed sense of purpose and a renewed sense of hopelessness. It was the latter that threatened to end my quest entirely. The impulse to sleep forever with the hope Ill be joined by my newborn was almost too tempting to pass up. Reopening old scar tissue on my arms and legs did little to quiet that voice. I had to stop waiting. 

The needles were long and fat and the contents were cold from the refrigerator. In that week, Id been with 30 men. My body ached and my self-esteem was gone, but theyd given me what I required. I carefully dissected the abdomens of the two homeless women Id lured up to my apartment and exsanguinated earlier this morning. Organs look so different in person, but I found my way around. I did some damage, but Im sure whatever ova I was able to suck into the syringe had to be healthier than what my body - the body of a failure - could produce. 

I injected myself with all of it, sperm and eggs, over the course of the day. My belly was a hole-filled, leaky wreck by the time I was done. The medication left me dizzier than Id ever been. But its all going to be worth it when this works. When this works, Im going to have a beautiful baby of my own. One who will be loved. One who wont be told he cant follow his dreams just because hes a boy.

<TITLE> He Went Ahead </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My friends and I used to break into old, run-down places and explore. This was back before people were videotaping their own explorations and getting ad-revenue from their YouTube channels. Back before cell phones, even. Wed go wherever we wanted without much concern for the consequences if we were caught. All of us were still under 18 and Kims mom was a police officer, so even if we did get in a little trouble, we were fairly confident itd be taken care of.

Michael was the one who usually made the decisions about where we should go. He suggested we check out an abandoned institution about an hour out of town. A few weeks earlier, after he got out of work, he told me he made a quick trip over there just to see if he could get in. Once he did, he only spent a couple minutes walking around before he got the creeps. Still, he knew it was exactly the type of place wed always talked about wanting to explore. 

Itd been defunct for a few decades by the time we knew about it, and every door was locked and the windows had been boarded up. Well, every window on the first couple floors. A tree, which was probably only a few feet tall when the crews went around locking the place up, had grown tremendously in the following tens of years. It was nearly effortless for the four of us to scale the branches and crawl through the window Michael had broken when hed done his cursory scouting of the place. A couple minutes later, we were standing in a filthy, dust-coated file room.

Kim really didnt like how many spiderwebs were hanging off pretty much everything. I cant say I was much of a fan either, but my excitement to explore that creepy place overrode my mild arachnophobia. Still, this was southern Florida; we have some enormous spiders down here. I prefered to not get one on me.

We opened the door of the file room and found ourselves in a long hallway. None of us were sure what the function of the building had been, and from what wed seen so far, it was still anyones guess. We took a left down the dimly-lit hall, grateful for the high-powered flashlights Michael suggested we bring after seeing how dark the place was on his first trip. 

Placed on the floor in front of each room along the hall was its corresponding key. The doors had small windows in them, and we peered through. It looked like they were basic rooms; a toilet, a bed, a small desk. Little else. The beds were pretty small; I wondered if they were for children. We gave each room a quick glance and determined there was nothing particularly noteworthy inside, so we moved on.

At the end of the hall, there was a door leading to the staircase. We propped it open and went into the pitch-black stairwell. The steps leading up ended at a door that was locked. No key was nearby that couldve opened it. Heading down, though, after many failed attempts at accessing the lower floors, we finally found a door that actually opened. Heres the problem: as soon as we pulled it open, the door wed propped open slammed shut from what we assumed was the air pressure of the other one opening. No one freaked out or anything; we knew we could get out from a window or something pretty easily from the lower floors. Still, having no known and obvious way out was somewhat unsettling.

When we stepped through the door and shone our flashlights around the room, we realized wed passed the first floor and were in the basement. I wondered aloud what kind of place doesnt label the fucking floors in their stairwell, but no one really cared about my complaint. We were all wondering how wed get out if there were no windows around.

From what we could see with our three flashlights, since Kims had died, the basement was enormous. It was one large room and was filled with junk that we assumed had populated the floors above. Desks, file cabinets, coat racks, and all that stuff. Darryl suggested we split up and look for a way out, but Michael and Kim quickly shot down that idea. Im pretty sure they were getting scared. I didnt want to say anything, but they werent the only ones. I dont know why Darryl was so confident. He was usually the one who chickened out at the first sign of trouble. I was grateful for his strength, though. It felt good to have someone who could lead us, even if he didnt know where he was going.

We wandered through all the junk in an attempt to find a way out of there. There was a loud banging sound. Kim realized what it was before any of us and whispered, was that the door? Murmurs of fuck variations through our small group. No one was ready to panic, though. Not yet. The basement had to have been the size of a football field. We came to an agreement to pair off and go in opposite directions. Wed yell if we found anything.

Kim and Darryl went one way, I went with Michael in the other. Wed agreed to travel with only one flashlight. Michael and I didnt come right out and say it, but we figured Kim would be better off with her group having two.

We spent a slow ten minutes walking through the old furniture until deciding to turn back and follow the wall. The room was even bigger than wed realized. From outside, the building was about as long as wed expected the basement to be; approximately that of a football field. In fact, the basement must have been many times larger. Michael said it probably connected with all the other buildings on the property, which meant it couldve been almost a quarter mile in each direction. I hoped that wouldnt be the case. The flashlights wouldnt last that long and the last thing I wanted to do is deal with complete blackness. I knew Id panic.

As we progressed, we started seeing doors. They were all locked, though. No keys, no windows. Michael yelled to Darryl and Kim and asked if theyd found anything. His voice didnt echo. It almost sounded as if it stopped right in front of his face; like he was standing in front of a wall. We heard no response from our friends.

Our flashlight was growing noticeably dimmer. I thought its intensity had been diminishing for the last couple minutes, but Id done my best to put it out of my mind. But there was no denying it now. Michael had picked up his pace, forcing me to rush to catch up to his long-legged stride. I yelled for the others, hearing my own voice die inches in front of my mouth. I could hear Michael breathing quickly. Was he sobbing? He was too far ahead for me to see any tears and I was almost jogging to catch up. We kept on for what felt like ten minutes. How had we not run into the others yet? Michael stopped dead in his tracks and I skidded to a stop to avoid bumping into him. There was a right turn down a narrow passage. At the very, very end, barely illuminated by the still-dimming light, was a metal ladder. 

Michael ran and I did my best to follow. The light was almost useless. We reached the end and both grasped the ladder and Michael shone the lamp upward. Whatever had been there, maybe a hatch, maybe just an opening to another floor, was nothing but concrete ceiling. He yelled, fuck! The word sounded like it was coming from underwater.

The flashlight strobed weakly. He turned around and shone it around the narrow corridor. A few feet in front of us, on the right, was a door. Lets try that, he told me. Wed given up trying the doors wed run by after all of them were locked. I was surprised he wanted to bother, but in our hopelessness, we walked over and I tried the knob. It opened. I walked in as Michael shone the sputtering flashlight in front of him. The room was small and empty. Almost empty. In the corner, there was a lump. Holy shit, I exclaimed, and ran toward it. Right as our flashlight died, I grabbed what Id seen for that brief moment. It was another flashlight. I couldnt believe our luck, despite being terrified of the stygian blackness enveloping us.

I fumbled for the switch and flipped it upward. Michael stood in the doorway. The light was strong and unwavering. Only then did I register the hideous smell of the room, somehow obscured by my earlier panic. I shone the light around the tiny, filthy area. Nothing. I turned around and pointed it at the lump behind where I saw the flashlight. Sitting in the corner was a corpse, its flesh swollen with putrefaction. Gray eyes pushed out of its thick and unrecognizable purple face. Its distended tongue bulged from lips that looked like a circle of rotting slugs. Worms fed. I retched. The corpse was wearing green cargo shorts and a Buccaneers jersey, both of which had been soaked through with greasy fluid.

Green cargo shorts and a Buccaneers jersey. I whirled around and looked at Michael, who was still standing in the doorway. Green cargo shorts and a Buccaneers jersey. I muttered something I cant remember. He dropped the dead flashlight and took two steps toward me. I screamed and stumbled backward, falling into the cadaver. I felt its swollen body burst under my weight. Soft, jellylike material clung to my back, neck, butt, and arms. The smell was incomprehensible. Flies buzzed angrily in my ears as I struggled to my feet and tried to keep the flashlight shining on the person, the thing, Id been walking with. 

The brilliant white of the lamp illuminated its face again. It hadnt moved any further after those first steps. It stared through me at the corner where Michaels destroyed body sat. Neither of us moved. Then its lower eyelids drooped. It almost looked like it was having a stroke, only on on both sides of its face. The skin continued to fall, lower, and lower, exposing the musculature underneath. The eyes burst from their sockets and hung down, swinging on their optic nerves. Then its mouth moved. I was paralyzed by abject terror. 

The mouth opened wider and wider, the jawbone snapping and popping as it shattered in protest of the constant force. The lower mandible hung flaccidly from its cheeks, connected only by skin. From its throat, something white began to drip. Then pour. Then flood. Repulsive, milky liquid gouted from the gaping hole in its throat. It splashed on the ground, soaking my feet and shins and knees. It was so slick; so warm; a perverse shower of liquid body heat that reminded me of semen and amniotic fluid.

The thing grabbed both sides of my head. I dropped the flashlight and it shone, uselessly, against the wall before blinking out, destroyed by the gushing fluid. In utter blackness, I felt incomprehensibly strong hands and arms pull me toward its mouth. My forehead touched the flood. I was pulled in, further and further. I gasped and aspirated the fluid. As I choked and coughed, more of it filled my lungs. I knew I was about to die. The blackness disappeared.

I awoke to a flashlight being shone in my face. Darryl was yelling my name while Kim screamed unintelligible blather beginning and ending with the word Michael. Darryl hauled me to my feet and practically carried me down the hall, across the expansive basement, and through the area theyd explored. Kim ran behind us, sobbing. I vomited milky bile as we went, coating Darryls arm, who gave no sign of noticing or caring. I have no idea how far we went, but I remember seeing daylight creeping around the beam of his flashlight. Over time, the flashlight became increasingly useless and he dropped it. We moved on and on. I was eventually able to run on my own and I followed them, cluelessly. But before I knew anything, we were outside. I passed out.

I was in the hospital for days that passed in a haze of incomprehension. Gradually, I regained some semblance of consciousness. Inquisitiveness followed. Michael, I was told, was dead. Id found his body. They assumed the shock of seeing my dead friend induced some temporary hysteria which caused me to desecrate the corpse. But still, no one knew what had happened to him. The fact his body looked like it had been dead for three weeks eliminated me from being a suspect in his death, but no one could explain how hed gotten to such a state of decomposition.  Not only his three friends, but his parents and coworkers, could verify theyd spoken and interacted with him every day up until he was found.

I havent said anything about what happened with the Michael-shaped creature after the body was found. I also didnt mention Michael had scouted out the place three weeks before we visited. I just wanted to believe I hallucinated the whole thing, but that didnt explain the unidentifiable organic fluid they found all over me, some of which which had dried in glutinous clumps that could only be removed by excising chunks of my skin. Twenty years later, every time I finger the scar tissue of the old excisions, I can still taste the stuff on my mouth and pouring down the back of my throat. Whenever I sit back in a chair, I expect it to burst like the body of the friend I once loved. And every time I get within 20 miles of the abandoned institution, I can hear Michael screaming for me to come back and help him.

<TITLE> Little Cows </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> About ten years ago, I dated a masseuse named Valerie. Well, masseuse in training. She was passionate and enthusiastic and she practiced as frequently as she could. That meant I got a ton of free massages. Obviously, since we were a couple, those massages would escalate and turn into that usual thing couples do, but it was only after she felt shed gotten in a good practice session.

After one of our, ahem, sessions, Val looked a little confused but also relieved. I asked her what was up. She told me the sores she had on the inside of her mouth didnt hurt anymore. Wed talked about those things before. She said they werent contagious, thankfully, but shed had to endure them for most of her life and they were intensely painful; sometimes even debilitatingly so. Doctors prescribed an ointment for her to put on them when the outbreaks occurred, but they barely took the edge off. Plus, she was deeply attached to the ideas of natural healing and homeopathy and all that, so she very, very rarely used the medication. But that night, for the first time in a while, I could tell she wasnt powering through her pain. She genuinely felt good and had no idea why.

Her pain returned a few hours later. As always, she did her best to ignore it. Fast forward a couple days - another massage, another occasion for sexy times. Midway through, she stopped kissing me and exclaimed, thats it! I didnt know what she was talking about. She rolled off me and stuck her finger in my mouth. Not really sure what the hell was going on, I just sat up on the bed and let her do whatever she was doing. She pulled her wet finger from my mouth and stuck it in her own. I saw her rubbing the inside of her cheek. Her face brightened and she informed me, with complete certainty, that my saliva was taking away her pain. I laughed and said something encouraging despite thinking she was nuts. Then she hopped back on me and I completely forgot everything shed said.

The next day, I was lying face down on her massage table. She was doing her usual, outstanding work while I stared down at the floor through that little padded hole where ones face goes. Without any warning, there was a blinding pain in my head. I passed out. I have no idea how long I was unconscious. When I came to, I tried to get up, but I was completely immobilized. I couldnt turn my head or lift my arms. It felt like I was taped to the table. Not only that, but there was something metal in my mouth. I couldnt close my jaw or even dislodge the thing with my tongue. I yelled around it. Valerie, whod apparently been standing next to me, simply said, shhhhhh.

I saw her hand and arm appear in front of my down-turned face. She held a small, glass baking dish, which she placed on the floor under my mouth. Im sorry if the speculum is uncomfortable, she said. At the mention of the word, I gagged. A thin column of saliva drooled from my gaping maw and landed inside the glass container. She reached under and gathered a dollop of the fluid onto her fingertip. Her hand disappeared from my field of view, but I knew where it was going. I heard her moan with relief.

Im not sure how long Ill keep you here, she informed me. But dont be loud.
In response, I yelled. A hideously sharp pain erupted from my lower back, right around my left kidney. Thats a 3 inch long pin, Valerie said. Please dont scream anymore. I hate hurting people. I shut up.

As the hours went by, the bottom of the pan grew slick with a cloudy puddle of my saliva. I heard Valerie walking around the house, doing laundry, washing dishes; basic, everyday activity. The clatter of pots and pans told me it was almost dinner time. I was ravenous; I estimated itd been almost 24 hours since Id had any food.

Glorious aromas wafted from the kitchen as she cooked. My salivary glands went into overdrive and I drizzled their secretions into the waiting container. I heard Val walk in and she placed a plate piled high with spaghetti carbonara and what appeared to be a pork chop directly next to the collection pan. My mouth oozed.

You cant have this, she whispered in my ear. But feel free to enjoy the smell.

She walked away and turned on the TV. The room filled with sitcom banalities as my body leaked its desire for the meal into the waiting dish. I wanted to cry.

At some point, I fell asleep. When I woke up in the morning, the plate of food was gone. The house was quiet. I assumed Val had gone to class. I gargled out a weak yell, but theres no way anyone wouldve heard it. I was so incredibly thirsty. The smell from the collected saliva was absolutely horrendous. I could see particulate matter dotting the glass bottom; probably old food that had detached from between my teeth. My mouth felt terribly dry. Saliva still leaked from the glands, but it was thick, almost like corn syrup. The color was milky gray. When it hit the stuff that was already in the pan, it separated like salad dressing. Oily liquid swirled to the top. I couldnt believe how much Id produced over the last couple days.

The sound of the front door opening heralded the return of Valerie. She walked over, putting her sneakers in my narrow view. I felt her scratch the top of my head. You doing okay?, she asked, sounding genuinely concerned. I muttered something obscene from around the speculum. She bent down and picked up the pan. Saliva sloshed thickly against the sides. Im going to let you go today, Val informed me. I choked out a sigh of relief.

I saw a knife for a second and was certain she was about to cut my throat. Instead, she sliced through the duct tape that was holding my head to the table. I craned my neck upward and tried to shake out the awful muscle cramps. In front of me, I watched Val carefully pour some of the accumulated spit into a glass. She brought it to her lips and took a tiny sip. I almost threw up. She didnt swallow right away. I could see her swishing it around her mouth and aerating it as if she were a disgusting sommelier sampling a fine Brunello. She smiled at me as she swallowed.

Valerie reached into her purse and pulled out a small handgun. Of course she had a fucking gun. I didnt move. She calmly told me she was about to cut me loose but if I ran before she could talk to me, Id get shot. I nodded. 

She cut the tape away. I was suddenly self-conscious as the smell of my old spit was replaced by the ammonia odor of when Id pissed myself those two times. Dont worry about it, she whispered. After everything was cut away, she apologized in advance before pulling the tape off my head to unsecure the speculum still violating my mouth. Chunks of hair came with the tape and I winced. I let the metal instrument drop to the ground. My jaw felt like itd been pummelled by a prize fighter.

I stood up and Val pointed the gun at my chest. I stretched, slowly, then sat back down. She took another small sip before she spoke.

When you leave, I know youre going to call the police. And I know Ill get arrested. But I just want you to know how much I appreciate you for helping me.

I didnt say anything. She was nuts. Obviously. She gulped down the rest of the cold saliva and put the glass on the coffee table. The pan was still 75% full.

You can go, she told me.

I grabbed my car keys from the table and left. As soon as I closed the door to her apartment, I sprinted as quickly as my cramped legs would allow, got into the car, and drove away. As I went home, I called 911 and did my best to explain what happened. They said theyd stop by her place and see what was going on, then theyd visit me at home. Sure enough, a few hours later, the police visited my apartment. They told me Valerie was dead. Self-inflicted gunshot wound. Shed left a note, but all it said was, youll understand soon enough.

A year later, I started getting sores in my mouth. The pain was indescribable. Theyd last for a couple days before bursting. Theyd eventually heal, but two weeks later theyd just reappear. I was missing work because I couldnt even breathe through my mouth without searing agony. The doctors gave me some awful-tasting ointment to put on them, but it might as well have been water. Nothing helped. 

I didnt want to, but I started sleeping around. Men, women, it didnt matter. Partner after partner crossed my bed. Finally, I found one. Then another. Then another. Seven years later, theyre up to a gallon of production per day. The flavor took some getting used to, but hey, the taste of medicine doesnt matter much when it actually works. The trick, I learned, was to keep my producers hydrated and fed just enough so the quality doesnt drop off. Early on, my little cows (thats what I call them) used to be pretty boisterous in the mornings when I went to collect their milk, but theyve calmed down over the years. I just hope they know how much I appreciate them. Deep down, I bet they do.

<TEXT> Theres nothing scary about the woods. Sorry guys. Or, should I say, sorry kids. I get it. You all saw Blair Witch Project or read some shitty creepypasta BS online and suddenly some of the most beautiful places in the world are havens for demons or zombies or whatever garbage is lining the pockets of writers these days. But guess what: its all your imagination. Look, I remember being a kid. My mind would go all over the place: ghosts, goblins, aliens, blah blah blah. You know what happened, though? I hit 13. I saw the real world.

Heres why Im so irritated about all this oooh Im too scared to go into the woods now bullshit. I live near a state park. There are quite a few local businesses that used to thrive because of the high number of hikers, picnickers, and daytrippers during the spring, summer, and fall. But over the last couple years, perfectly coinciding with those idiot kids one-upping each other to cry about how scared they are, these businesses have lost a ton of money. Yes, I own one of them. An ice cream stand.

I could see the trend starting, too. Pasty white, black-clad preteens on vacation with their parents would whine about being too frightened to go on a mile-long hike along a pristine trail just because there were spooky trees around. All while shoveling ice cream into their soft faces. I thought back to what my father wouldve done if I complained about being too much of a baby to walk around outside for an afternoon. The only ice cream hed have bought wouldve been for me to put on my black eye.

So Ive lost money because of this shit. My buddies lost money, too. Spouses divorced each other, kids ended up not going to the colleges they wanted to, and the local economy, aside from the revenue from skiers in the winter, went to hell. And its all because of those little assholes who think fragile bleating and cowering in fear is more desirable than strength and resiliency. I weep for the future.

My ice cream stand is supposed to reopen on March 1st. Already, though, I can tell its going to be a brutal season. The pervasiveness of those online stories about creepy things in the woods and omg I cant believe what I found in this diary while I was hiking has just grown and grown. When I look through the comments on the ridiculous websites that showcase that trash, I see adults, *ADULTS*, saying how terrified they are to even go out in their backyards because they think some skinny guy in a suit or a troll monster is going to possess them or something. 

Never once have the authors of that garbage thought about how their recklessness is destroying small businesses. Before my wife died, I used to be able to look out from my back porch and see families hiking through the woods, kids skipping stones across the pond, and dads teaching their sons or daughters how to safely build a fire using sticks. Now, theres just the timeless woods and a devastated economy. The childish dopes succeeded in scaring themselves away from nature and they screwed up the livelihoods of real people in the process.

Thankfully, every now and then, a family will walk by the house and do the things I used to see before all that Im too scared horseshit started. The other day, for the first time in nearly three years, a young couple braved the melting snow and mud and set up a tent right on the outskirts of my property. Do you know how happy it made me to finally see some people who werent afraid of ghosts or haunted woods? 

I mustve stayed in the tent until the sun came up, enjoying their warm, young meat. The women died instantly but her husband or boyfriend or whatever remained alive for hours. The only benefit of such a low population of hikers nowadays is that not a single person heard him screaming as he watched me eat the most tender morsels of his partner before I unleashed my appetite on him. Another bonus: they were in a tent! I just had to wrap it around them and drag them back to the house. No fuss, no muss. 

After all my complaining, I have to admit, finding two people who were brave enough to go out in the woods helped me feel better. It showed me they didnt follow trends and did their own thing, just like in the old days. It doesnt entirely make up for the lost wages and the harm to our local economy, but its still something. That knowledge, plus a freezer full of meat thatll last me through the spring, helps warm my cynical heart.

<TEXT> I dont want to write about this. Ill try to keep it short. My doctor suggested I put it down on paper, though, so he can have a better idea of how everything happened. Hed never seen such a thing in his 30 years of practicing medicine and he actually wants to talk about my case at an ENT conference next summer. So why am I posting the story here? Because if I have to suffer through writing it, you might as well suffer through reading it. Yeah, Im a prick. 

Id always been an avid outdoorsman. Hiking was my thing. After my divorce, I did what I thought I had to do: quit my job and hike the whole Appalachian Trail. You know how your coaches always used to say walk it off after a bad hit? Well, after being sodomized by the vicious cock of alimony, I needed the longest walk I could think of. So off I went.

It was March when I started and I was pretty damn cold for a while, but I knew itd warm up as the hike progressed. Contrary to the wishes of my friends, Id insisted on going alone. I was an experienced hiker. No, I hadnt gone such a great distance before, but I was definitely in good physical shape and knew quite a bit about outdoorsy stuff from spending time in the woods with my father before he died.

To be honest, the first six weeks bored the living shit out of me. Yes, the scenery was beautiful. Yes, the feeling of accomplishment I expected to experience at the end of it all would be memorable. Still, it sucked. I found myself walking faster and faster just hoping to finish a day or so earlier so I wouldnt have to deal with it anymore. 

On cue, when my boredom had reached its peak, I got an awful cold. It was a nightmare. It seemed like every ten steps I had to stop, pick up an old leaf, and blow a gallon of snot out of me. For those who are laughing at me right now and saying Im stupid for not just blowing out snot rockets, hey - Im glad I could give you something to laugh at. But the reality of the situation was that the shit up my nose was like rubber cement. The one time I tried to blow without a leaf, I got a trail of yellow slime going from my left nostril to my knee. So thanks for laughing, but fuck off.

Anyway, as the days went by and Id Hansel-and-Greteled the forest with mucousy leaves, I started to get concerned that my cold hadnt gotten any better. Quite the contrary. My sinuses were packed with snot. And I mean packed; you know when youre in bed and you put your head on one side and you can feel your sinuses drain a little and get some relief? There was no relief. And every few minutes, I was blowing progressively-thicker goo onto anything unfortunate enough to get within my reach.

There was one morning in early May, after Id been sick for two straight weeks, that I knew I needed to hop off the trail and find a local clinic. I was fairly sure I had a sinus infection and it was severely affecting the amount of walking I wanted to do every day. I took a turn off the trail and in the general direction of a town.

The map indicated Id be off the trail for almost a day. It wasnt the ideal situation, but I really wanted to get some antibiotics. The way out was through. A few miles in, though, the pressure in my sinuses turned into blinding pain. I had to sit down and rest. There was no way Id be able to get to town before dark at the rate I was going. I did my best to blow out the horrible contents of my nose, which was now dark yellow and as viscous as chewing gum. 

I used my fingers to pull out as much as I could. There was almost no relief, though. Most of it was deep in my sinuses and no amount of picking or blowing was going to get it out. I wandered over to a small stream to wash my disgusting hands. As I pulled the slime off my fingers, I caught sight of something that caused me to gasp. I looked under my index fingernail. Buried inside the compacted dirt and snot was the unmistakable segmented body of a white worm.

Now I was really, really freaked out. I dragged the piece out from under my nail and inspected it. It wasnt a whole worm. It looked like my fingernail had broken off either the front or back end of the thing. The pressure in my sinuses only intensified as my panic grew. I told myself the piece of worm had to have been under my nail before it I picked my nose. It was futile consolation. Every night for the last couple nights Id heard what I thought was the moving and settling of my sinus contents. Now I knew. Id heard them moving around. And that realization was where I lost it.

Rather than trying to blow out, I snorted the contents backward, trying to get them into my throat so I could spit them out. After a couple powerful snorts, I felt something hit the back of my throat. I spit it onto the ground. On the brown pine needles, a fat white worm half the size of my pinky wriggled in yellow snot. I screamed. 

Over and over I tried to spit more of them out. Only one came. With the slightly diminished sinus pressure, I could feel them for what they were. This was the first time theyd been able to make any significant movement because theyd been so tightly packed together. But now, they wandered. I felt their thick bodies crawling around behind my nose and under my eyes. I started to hyperventilate when I felt one start to slither down into my nostril. I scratched and pulled at it with my fingers, but it wouldnt budge. It just sat there, writhing. 

The sensation was indescribably horrific and I needed the fucking thing out of me. I squeezed my nostrils together with my hand as hard as I could. I felt the worm burst inside and a torrent of gray sludge poured out of its destroyed body. Now deflated, I could pull its body all the way out. It was almost three inches long. It slapped on the forest floor like a used condom.

While the terror I felt was immeasurable, having expelled three worms from my sinuses gave me more relief from the pressure than I could have imagined. I still could feel others slithering inside me, though. But my breathing was much, much better. I started to run toward town. I didnt stop until I got there.

There isnt much else to say. I got to the main road and a kind soul let me hitch a ride to the clinic in the back of his pickup. The local doctor was pretty surprised, but he didnt seem to think I was in any danger. He asked where I lived, did a little research, and found a highly-accomplished ear, nose, and throat specialist only a couple miles from my house. Later that night I was on a plane back home. The pressure change of the airplane wreaked havoc on my sinuses and it felt like the worms inside were throwing party, but I managed to stay somewhat composed. The guy next to me didnt particularly like how I kept snorting up phlegm and spitting it into the puke bag.

The next morning, I met with the ENT guy. He did a whole bunch of stuff with small cameras that made me gag and he made a lot of sounds like he was absolutely fascinated by what was in me. After he pulled seven of the things out of me and warned that there are probably eggs inside thatll need to get dealt with sooner or later, he tried to figure out how theyd gotten there. It only took about 20 minutes before he concluded Id gotten their eggs in my nose from one of the leaves Id used as a tissue when I first got the cold. Lovely.

So thats that. Over the next couple weeks, he did some stuff to clean out my sinuses and gave me some pills he said would kill anything else that might be up there. Last week, he asked me to write this shit so he could share it with his ENT buddies who were really jealous hed gotten to treat such a cool case. Well, hi guys. Every time I blow my nose I expect to see a fat worm looking up at me from the tissue asking why I evicted it from its home. Have a great conference.

<TEXT> **FDD MICROCYCLE: Angel-Snowdrop-Caterpillar** 

I dont want to bring my son into town because I know people will stare and try to interfere. You know the kind of folks Im talking about. Gossips and busybodies. Theyll look at him and say hes sick; that his color looks bad; that hes lethargic. A couple men, Jehovahs Witnesses, I think, rang the bell last week. I answered with my boy in my arms, and they had the audacity to gasp when they saw Cullen. I just slammed the door in their stupid, pious faces. I have my own faith, anyway -- my Lord tells me everyone is welcome, no matter how they look.

When Cullys mom died giving birth to him, I buried her myself. Its what weve always done in our family. Weve had six generations of Dempseys come and go. Each one is on our property, six feet underground at the foot of the rock face. No gravestones. No need to tie them to their earthly names when theyre beyond. Their memories live on through our journals and essays. Its what my great-many-time-over grandfather, Finian Domnall Dempsey, demanded of all his children, grandchildren, and so on. Its how our legacy will endure. 

Ill admit to not being the best father over the first couple months of Cullys life. I often forget to feed him. Sometimes I leave him alone for hours at a time if I need to run errands. Ive never once heard him cry or whine, though. Hes very sweet like that. Not a complainer. One thing Ive always remembered to do, though, since its hard to forget, is bathe him. As the time has gone by, his smell has gotten worse and worse. In the back of my mind, I know the reason. Im not ready to admit it yet. My boy is healthy. Strong.

**FDD MICROCYCLE: Angel-Sunflower-Lamb**

This was one of our shorter microcycles. It feels good to write an update so soon, though; only about a month after the last one. Cullen hasnt moved. The food I tuck into his mouth, hoping hell swallow, just sits there and putrefies until I turn him over and let it tumble out. That thing in the back of my mind I mentioned last microcycle is hard to deny nowadays. Cullys gone unwashed for at least three weeks. Whenever I tried to do it, hed get damaged. I cant bear to hurt my boy. Ive since swaddled him up in the tiny blanket Sine had knitted for him. I wish she couldve seen him in it. He looks so peaceful.

**FDD MICROCYCLE: Archangel-Thistle-Lion**

I had to stop denying the reality of Cullens situation today. More and more of him had leaked through the blue pastel blanket his mother had made to keep him warm and safe. The entire house smelled of death. The end of the macrocycle just made the impending trip to the rock face that much more of a necessity.

At the foot of the rock face, above the bodies of those who came before me, countless flowers grew. Their bright faces shone with hope and encouragement, doing their best to cut through the morosity I felt. I carefully placed Cullen on the grass. I unwrapped the blanket and stared at the carcass of my son. As the wind took his odor away and poured it into the woods, I thought about the long wait Id have to endure. Another three quarters of a year until Id see my next Angel. 

The swollen torso of Cullen collapsed inward as his livid flesh melted into the grass. His little mouth stretched open, popping softly as the decayed jawbone separated. His swollen tongue pushed itself out over his nose and forehead, followed by his esophagus, stomach, and intestines. A wanton orgy of flies descended upon the viscera, only to die the moment they touched the glistening surface. From the soil beneath my beloved boy, countless black tendrils of the finest gossamer erupted in an infinitely-long, omnidirectional spread. In my mind, I recalled the last words in Finian Domnall Dempseys journal hed left before inaugurating the very first macrocycle: *...and corruption will begin its inexorable metastasis in testicles and breasts and bones.*

The carcinogenic tendrils of Archangelic filaments continued their eruption until the last of my beautiful boy had dissolved into the dirt. And he was gone. I mourned for what felt like hours and watched snowdrops, sunflowers, and thistles rise from the Cullen-fertilized ground. I felt empty. Alone. 

I walked back into my home, trudged down to the basement, and unlocked the cage which held the soon-mother of my future Angel. I told her what her name would be, then I handed her a ball of yarn and two needles. Sine got to work immediately. Later that afternoon, I planted the seed of the new Cullen. All thats left for me to do is wait.

<TEXT> Pre-investigation memorandum, Detective Natalie Hermoso. February 5, 2016.

I was mailed this dashboard camera following the initial police and paramedic response to the incident on Route 3, January 2, 2016. I am endeavoring to determine whether the audio captured on the camera coincides with the physical evidence on scene, or if it is unrelated, undeterminable, or a hoax. Attached is the annotated transcript of the audio log. Video recovery is unavailable.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You know when you have something in your house or yard for so long it just becomes part of the scenery? You dont pay any day-to-day attention to it, but youd know right away if it was missing or damaged? Well, Im a retired farmer. Ive got more property than I know what to do with and more stuff than I know where to put. After 65 years of living in the same spot with the same junk, everything is just scenery. Me included.

Early this morning, when I was making some coffee, I noticed the scarecrow out back was different. I couldnt quite put my finger on what it was. Its pretty far away from the house, and the way my eyesight is these days, I wouldnt be finding out what had changed until I hauled myself across the field to look from up close. But with the rain coming down as bad as it was, I wouldnt be satisfying my curiosity any time soon.

I forgot about the scarecrow and went about my daily routine. Coffee with a bacon sandwich on rye with butter. I still have no idea how I developed a taste for rye. When Peggy was still around, shed always make fun of me for having exotic tastes. I did my best to downplay my love for the stuff when she made her own bread. It was good, but wasnt rye. That said, Id give up my stupid rye if it meant getting her back.

I had my breakfast at the kitchen table while reading the obituaries. Some poor bastard had published an obit for his Golden Retriever, Happy. Peggy wanted a Golden all her life and I kept putting it off and putting it off until her doctor found the cancer. A month later, I was a widower who never got his wife the one thing shed always wanted. I hated how that felt. Still do. I tossed the paper across the table and went into the living room to watch some TV.

Morning television is horseshit. One of the things that really stinks about getting older is you just cant sleep in anymore. Its not even the fact Im wide awake as soon as the god damn rooster starts screaming outside, but its how Ive been back and forth to the toilet 12 times since I nodded off the night before. Its hard to rest when youve got a prostate like a softball. Anyway, I was in my recliner watching some awful television about a judge who yells at people when there was a loud bang outside near the kitchen.

I figured some poor, dumb bird flew himself into one of the windows or the storm door. I dragged myself off the recliner and headed toward the kitchen, fairly certain Id have to be replacing some cracked glass. The last thing I needed was water getting in the house.

To my surprise, despite the telltale shape of a birds dusty body on the window, all the glass was fine. Filthy, because Im too lazy to wash them more than once a month, but fine. Satisfied yet tremendously bored, I stared outside and remembered the change to the scarecrow. With my curiosity still piqued, I directed my gaze at it. Same weirdness. The wind was making the remainder of the cornstalks bend pretty badly, but the rain had finally tapered off. I pulled on my boots, opened the back door, and headed out into the field.

The scarecrow stood about 500 feet, or around 150 meters for you Euros, away from the house. Peggy suggested we get it back in the 70s. I never really knew why. We didnt have any damn crows. Shed dressed the thing in an old tuxedo shed found at some thrift store, and that was that. Still no crows. Over the decades, the clothes became worn and tattered. The tux was just scraps of cloth but its cork or whatever-wood body stayed pretty intact. Thats why I got surprised when it looked different that morning. The thing was built like a tank.

I couldnt see a damn thing as I walked through the field in the scarecrows direction. Most of the viable corn plants were gone, but lots of crappy ones still grew pretty tall. I was soaked from the dripping stalks after just ten steps. I figured I might as well keep going just to satisfy the diminishing curiosity and feel like I succeeded in doing something today. After a couple minutes, I got to the scarecrow.

It stood about 15 feet high. When I looked up at it, I felt like an assholes asshole. Whyd it look different? The wind had blown so hard it turned the body around so instead of its front facing the window, its side did. And if I actually got glasses when the doctor told me to, I wouldve seen that from the kitchen and saved myself a walk and a soaking. I headed back.

I stepped out of the cornfield and went around to the front of the house. Id forgotten to put away my motorcycle the night before and I needed to make sure the wind hadnt blown it over. Once I saw the bike was fine, I turned and saw that the fucking storm door was shattered. On cue, the torrential rain resumed, further soaking me and pouring into the house. I was not happy.

Blood-covered glass from the storm door crunched under my boots as I walked through the front hall. The thing that hit the door mustve been huge; itd left a trail of gore all the way into the living room. Whatever it was stunk so bad my eyes started to water. As I looked around for its corpse, I stopped in my tracks. The scarecrow, the pouring rain, and the shattered door were put out of my mind when I saw a dog standing next to my recliner. It was terribly injured. Injured to the point where I couldnt believe it was still alive.

Loops of intestines clung to the floor, leaking putrid grease that bloomed outward as it spread over the hardwood. Its remaining fur, once yellow or some variant thereof, was matted with encrusted blood and other nauseating fluids. It looked emaciated; the flesh of its chest clung to its ribs like rotting shrinkwrap. Through the patchy fur by its neck, a massive infestation of maggots writhed and chewed at the meat. But still, somehow, the dog stood.

When it saw me, the remaining part of the tail swung weakly, as if it was happy to see me. Something clicked and my blood chilled. Happy. The color of the dog was definitely gold. I could see it now that Id made the connection. I said aloud, Happy, and the ruined animals tail wagged even harder. Its smell was incomprehensibly awful. Behind the odor of putrefaction, though, something else lurked. Something familiar and, dare I say, pleasurable. I told the dog to stay, assuming it would die from its injuries before I came back, and I walked into the kitchen. Happy, like all Golden Retrievers, disobeyed. He followed me; bowels dragging behind him.

The other smell intensified as I got closer to the kitchen. I looked on the table. A loaf of rye bread sat on a cooling rack with tendrils of steam rising from its surface. My confusion was turning into frustration. Who the hell brought me a loaf of bread? Whys there a left-for-dead dog stinking up the house? My questions were answered when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I jumped half a mile and spun around. In the same green dress she was married in; the same green dress she was buried in, was Peggy. Wisps of blonde hair grew from the desiccated flesh of her scalp. The empty sockets which housed the eyes Id gazed into so often gaped at me. Then I knew.

I embraced my wife with care. I didnt want to damage her. Then I released her and sat at the table, chewing on the best rye bread Ive ever eaten. Happy sniffed at Peggy, who knelt down, joints cracking like gunshots, and wrapped her arms around its rotting body. She pressed the side of her head against his wormy neck. I could tell she loved him. After Id eaten my fill and watched Happys ragged, dry tongue adoringly lick between Peggys teeth, I started to write. And here I am. Well, here we are.

Peggy had gotten the revolver down from the shelf in the pantry. She placed it on the table while I wrote, then came behind me and wrapped her arms around my torso. Now her head is resting on my shoulder, waiting for me to finish up. If anyone asks what happened to the old farmer who lived on the edge of town, just show them this letter. Im ready to go spend time with my wife.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before my husband died, our daughter, Veronica, was diagnosed with childhood schizophrenia. We brought her to countless specialists and nearly all of them came to the same conclusion. The condition is rare, but certainly not unheard of. We were devastated. The doctors suggested that we not start her on medication right away. They were concerned the chemicals might interfere with the development of her brain. At five years old, when proper brain development is critical, they didnt want to chance it. Only if the hallucinations became severe would they prescribe antipsychotics.

Paul said it might help if we could identify the hallucinations over the course of the next year so we might know what to expect before she started school. This was pretty hard for me to agree with. Id wanted her to start kindergarten right away. Shed demonstrated she was smart enough and more than capable, but eventually I caved. I just didnt want to admit that Veronica needed special attention. We needed to separate her hallucinations from the normal, everyday make-believe that every kid her age does.

We started to pick up on a few outliers. One was a big dog who played with her while she was supposed to be sleeping. The other was a fish who followed her around and talked to her about cartoons. Most disconcerting to both of us, though, was the dark man with no eyes, nose, or ears who said how much fun it would be if she ran out and played in the street. More than once, Paul told me hed chased after Veronica after she opened the screen door and ran toward the busy road.

After the third time, Paul got up at dawn, called in sick, and spent the day putting up a fence. It was summertime, and as much as I wanted to keep Veronica indoors, I knew sunshine and fresh air were too important for her to miss out on. Still, whenever Veronica played outside, she would make a beeline for the fence and start crying whenever she couldnt go beyond it. I remember sitting with her on the grass next to the fence as she sobbed and talked to the fish about how the dark man was mad at her and had told the dog to be mean when they played. Then she screamed for a long time. When I finally got her to tell me what was wrong, all she said was that the fish got hit by a car and died. I did my best to console her, but it was useless.

Paul and I had a long talk that night. We decided her condition might be bad enough to require the medication wed desperately tried to avoid giving her. After a trip to the doctor, who listened intently to all the observations wed made, he agreed her condition was potentially severe and prescribed the drugs. We were told to observe her very, very carefully. The medication could cause the hallucinations to get worse before they got better.

Three days into Veronicas medication experiment, her hallucinations became violent. Id never seen our daughter so frightened. Over the course of two terrifying days, shed describe to us how the fish turned into a monster after he died and made her water taste rotten; how the dog would hurt her whenever she was alone; how the dark man without the nose, ears, or eyes scratched her tummy so hard shed start bleeding. Then she lifted her shirt. There were fresh scratches all over her belly. I looked at her fingernails, and sure enough, I could see tiny scraps of skin and blood underneath. Paul and I were at a loss.

The stress of Veronicas episodes strained the relationship between me and my husband. I could tell his depression had reemerged. Still, I cared more about my innocent daughter than my adult spouse. The doctors asked that we begin to taper off Veronicas medication to see if things got any better. I couldnt see any difference. Veronica was always scared and kept scratching herself when we werent around, usually when she was asleep.

Paul and I began trading off nights where we slept in Veronicas room to keep an eye on her. Still, Id find blood on her sheets and clothes and under her nails whenever Id check. Each of her hallucinations had become violent. The fish would bite her, the dog would lie on top of her so she couldnt breathe, and the dark man would scratch her. I seriously wondered if Veronica needed to be institutionalized.

Paul shot himself in the head on a Sunday morning while Veronica and I were in the kitchen eating breakfast. I wont bother detailing the shock, the feeling of betrayal, and the sheer sensation of helplessness that followed. I was left alone to care for a dreadfully ill daughter.

A couple weeks after his funeral, I was cleaning the house with Veronica by my side, proudly displaying the new mittens her aunt had purchased for her in hopes that she might stop scratching. So far, theyd worked pretty well. For whatever reason, Veronica was in one of her rare good moods as we went through the house. I was boxing up small stuff that had belonged to Paul. It hurt too much to see it every day.

Veronica chattered idly about sleeping a lot better lately with no bad dreams and the dog not getting on top of her anymore and the fish being kind and funny again. I told her how nice that was and we brought the box I was carrying out back to Pauls shed. I thought about asking her if the dark man with the scary face was still asking her to hurt herself. Before I could speak, I saw her furiously scratching her belly. I sighed. Thank goodness for the mittens.

After trying about 15 of the 30-or-so keys Paul had kept on his keyring, I finally chose the right one for the shed. I opened the door and Veronica ran inside to explore. She turned left, I turned right, looking for a place to put the box. Veronica giggled and exclaimed, now *Im* on top of *you*! I turned toward her to see who she was talking to. Crumpled up in the corner, underneath Veronica, was a dog suit.

<TEXT> When I was 17, I was in a head-on collision with another driver. I think I was unconscious for a minute or two after the impact. When I came to, I was confused and couldnt feel any pain. I couldnt move much, though. Something was pinning me. A downward glance showed me what it was. There was a metal rod impaling directly under my knee, through what the doctors later told me was my patellar tendon. It had pushed through the tendon, lifted my kneecap, and driven itself up the length of my thigh. It wasnt too deep inside; I could see it bulging under my skin.

A minute later, I felt everything. I screamed and screamed, thrashing for a bit before realizing any movement only intensified the pain in my knee and thigh. Then I looked out the cracked windshield and saw the other driver. His devastated skull sat on his neck like a mashed fruit. I could see his tongue lolling out of his ruined mouth. Without a lower jawbone to hold it in place, it hung down to his Adams apple. The remaining eye stared, unblinking, at the damaged its owner had caused. 

Another wave of impossibly acute agony surged through me, blurring my vision and forcing me to bite down on my own teeth until I felt at least one molar crack. Some part of my consciousness registered the fact I was hyperventilating and worked to calm my breathing. A couple moments later, the wave had passed. I realized no cars had come upon our accident yet. I tried to reach into the back pocket of my shorts for my cell phone, but there was no way the rod in my knee would allow that much movement. In exchange for my attempt, the unbearable pain resumed.

Once Id regained my senses, I looked again at the remains of the other driver. There wasnt much I could make out. It looked he hed had a beard; hair was puffing out from the skin of what might have been his cheeks. Even though he was the one whod caused me all this pain, I felt bad he was dead. No one deserved to have that happen to them. While I studied the gore with morbid fascination, the mans neck jerked and sent the fleshy wreckage of his face flopping back and forth. He jerked again. This time, his shoulders and torso moved as well. I gagged as the movement forced his head downward and bits of his crushed brain oozed from the hole that was once his face.

The man continued moving as if he was enduring a terrible seizure. My pain came back. Unable to bear the sensation, I blacked out. It couldnt have been very long. When I came to, there was something wrong with the mans body. Something I couldnt understand. The hole where his face had connected to his throat was stuffed with something. It slid out in a thick, wet mass onto the twisted steering wheel and dashboard. From my vantage point, about six feet away, I could only describe it as a worm or snake. Still, it was unlike either of those things. The body was grayish-white and oozed heavy, milky yellow discharge from gaping pores which covered the entirety of its length. That length increased as I watched with growing horror.

The return of the pain in my knee was unable to overcome the fear sweeping over me at the sight of the monster. Over ten feet had unfurled from the carcass and had draped itself along the dashboard. It was lying on surfaces coated with pulverized glass from the windshield, and I could see chunks of it sticking in its pores as it moved. The thing didnt seem to mind. Once another few feet came out, I saw its tail end finally discharge itself from the man. The parasite squirmed off the dashboard and onto the crumpled union of car hoods. The viscous, milky slime clung to every surface it touched and kept the creature connected to the contacted surfaces by thin ropes. It uncoiled completely and its full length lay wetly on our cars. The smell coming from its body was thick and putrescent with a revolting, cloying sweetness. I struggled not to retch, not wanting it to hear me.

The pores stopped oozing. An unsettling, peristaltic ripple passed through the things body. Ugly flatulent sounds leaked from each pore, and I saw something moving inside them. With an explosive jolt that caused me to jump in shock, bright red tendrils burst out of its pores. Each one was about as thick as a pencil and every pore contained at least 20 of them. They grew and grew in length, some laying flaccidly on the cars and some erecting themselves and flopping around like severed electrical cables.

I screamed when a couple of the tendrils brushed against me as they grew. But seconds later, every one of them pushed downward and dragged the main body onto the surface of the road. An 18-wheeler was driving toward us. It screeched to a halt and I watched an overweight trucker stumble out of the cab and run toward us. First he looked over and saw the dead man was far beyond help. Then he saw me and my look of pain and terror. He opened his mouth, presumably to say hed call 911, but the tendrils leapt into his mouth and throat before he could get a word out. 

The trucker grasped the thick cord of tendrils invading him and tried to pull. More shot out from the thing in the road and wrapped themselves around his fat form. Over the course of a minute, the main body had been pulled over to the trucker. Gradually, the tendrils retracted from the mans mouth while the body forced itself into his throat. The putrid seminal fluid again began to leak from the creature as it pushed deeper and deeper. A little while later, it was inside. The man was soaked from head to toe with the vile substance. But he no longer looked afraid. He just looked calm. He turned around and walked back to his truck, leaving a trail of milky-yellow slime. I heard the engine start and the truck drove away.

Another car noticed us soon after. The paramedics were called and I was brought to the hospital. I never told anyone what happened. I assume everyone was confused about what the slime was, but I didnt hear them talk about it. All they were concerned about was the wound in my leg, which required two years to recover. I never saw the parasite, or any hint of it, again. It was another five years before Id conquered my fear of driving. Ive done my best to forget about what I saw. No matter how hard I try, though, I still shudder when a truck passes me and I see the driver through his open window. I know that thing is still in one of them. At least one.

<TEXT> Shanice and I are lucky enough to live in an area replete with wildlife. Every morning, when were sitting at the porch table having coffee or simply looking out our kitchen window, deer, foxes, squirrels, groundhogs, chipmunks, or other local fauna appear in our large backyard. Having property near a national park has its perks.

While Shanice is enamored with all things furry and adorable, or totes adorbs, which she squeals just to watch me cringe, Ive grown to love birds. Dont get me wrong - Im also quite fond of the totes adorbs variety of animals. Our cat, Meowsers, totes exemplifies adorbs. Still, something about birds relaxes me in a way I find difficult to describe. We have such a magnificent diversity of the flying creatures that even after five years of living here, I think I see a new kind every week.

Ive set up quite a few feeding stations throughout our backyard. My personal favorite is a spot right outside the kitchen windows where hummingbirds congregate. It amazes me how their tiny bodies can contain so much energy to flap their delicate wings as quickly as they do and flit away in the blink of an eye. But its not just the hummingbirds. In our yard, sparrows and jays tweet, ravens and jackdaws caw, and the occasional owl endlessly asks the same question. 

Whenever the weather allows it, Ill wander our property and the adjacent park with my head tilted toward the trees to see which of my friends are out and about. Sometimes I came across a hiker or fellow birdwatcher and wed get to talking about our hobbies and interests before Id retreat back to my own head and continue walking and observing. I wont tell Shanice, but sometimes I wish I was a Disney princess who could tame birds and go on adventures with them. A 34 year old, bearded Disney princess with a 3-plate squat and a 4-plate deadlift. Dont judge me.

One evening, as we sat in the living room and watched TV, we heard the jingle of the bell on Meowsers collar as she came in through the cat door. She wandered into the living room and looked at Shanice and me, deciding whose lap shed grace with her presence. A moment later, I was the chosen one. Meowsers leapt onto my lap and immediately began extending and retracting her claws in an autonomic display of pleasurable biscuit-making.

At a commercial, Shanice got up and went into the kitchen to refill her wine glass. I heard her yell God damn it, Meowsers! I looked down at the cat and asked her if she peed on the floor again. Meowsers purred adoringly. Shanice came back into the room holding something in a paper towel. She brought it closer and I could see it was a baby bird. Maybe a robin. Its belly had been torn open and its guts dangled from the wound. Ugly, yellowish-red liquid bloomed outward from the viscera clinging to the towel. I gagged.

The next day, I went and looked around the outside of the house for nests that might be reachable by Meowsers. I hated to disturb them, but I figured the birds would prefer inconvenience over the gleeful murder of their babies by my cat. They werent too hard to find, but my quick inspection of the first few determined they were empty and abandoned. 

After another few minutes, I found one with tiny babies inside. I wondered where their mom was. All three of them chirped pathetically as I took great care in lifting the nest and bringing it up the steps to the porch. Id set up a ladder which led up to the roof. I knew Meowsers couldnt get up there, and I hoped the shadow of the chimney would be a safe spot with relative shelter from the elements. 

While I carried the nest, I noticed a few details Id missed at my first glance. When I realized what they were, my blood ran cold. The nest was woven together with what had to be human hair. All different colors, too. I placed it down on the edge of the porch and took a closer look. It was definitely hair. I moved it around a little bit with my fingers as the birds high-pitched screams of terror and hunger drowned out the singsong calls of the ubiquitous adults. Buried within the body of the nest were tattered scraps of leathery material and hard, gray fragments. I gingerly pulled one out with my thumb and forefinger. As soon as I felt it, I knew what it was. A human tooth.

Something was terribly, terribly wrong. I ran back to the other, abandoned nests that Id only glanced at before. Closer inspection yielded similar construction. When I turned one of them over, I saw a childs pink necklace was embedded within the tangle of hair. I felt panic rise in my chest. After Id calmed my breathing enough to yell, I screamed for Shanice to come outside. She had to see what I was seeing to make sure I wasnt going crazy.

Shanice was visibly shaken by my find. The whole thing got even worse when she pointed out that the leathery material was skin. Without even discussing it with one another, we both knew what we needed to do. 

After stopping at the garage to get some tools and a couple sheets of plywood, we threw it all in the pickup, grabbed the ladder from the porch, and drove over to the edge of our property about a quarter mile from the house. When we got to the shed, sure enough, there was a big hole in the roof. Shanice had been bugging me for almost two years to make sure the shed was sturdy and strong, but Id always put it off because the smell got to me.

Shanice teased me and made me do the majority of the work myself, always laughing when I had to stop and retch. After I hammered in the last nail, I went inside to make sure there were no birds trapped in there. I stepped over the putrefying bodies of hikers and birdwatchers and, sure enough, a tiny nest was hidden in the corner. A couple baby birds lay sleeping inside. How they managed to sleep through the hammering and bickering was beyond me. I smiled and picked up their little home and brought it out into the light. I handed it to Shanice, who grinned at the sight of the babies, and I closed the shed door and replaced the padlock.

While we headed back toward the house, Shanice carefully stroked the head of one of the sleeping babies with her index finger. You know, she said, I guess baby birds can be pretty adorbs too. I beamed. Maybe she was finally coming around.

<TITLE> Dial Tone </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-26 01:54:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Theres a land line phone in the cabin where Im staying to finish my novel. Cell service is practically nonexistent and God knows we wont be seeing any major broadband providers stringing lines around here for another 50 years. I can get online using a 56k modem and connect to a shitty long-distance ISP, but Ill be damned if Im getting more than 14.4 speed whenever its windy out. Its always windy out.

My plans for the days were pretty simple. Id get up around 7, have breakfast, and start writing by 8. Id make lunch around 1, call my wife at work during her own lunch break, then go back to writing until 6 or 7. Then dinner and bed.

On Saturday, when I picked up the phone to call Tasha during her lunch, the dial tone sounded off. It was pitched differently. You know how all the land line phones in the US have the same tone and you get used to hearing it every time? Well, it wasnt that tone. It was pitched higher. It was as if the normal tone is an A note on a piano and the strange one Saturday was A#. The difference wasnt big, but it was definitely noticeable. At first, I was fairly certain it meant there was a problem with the line. But when I called Tasha, the call went through without any problem at all. The sound quality was no different, either.

I forgot about the dial tone until last night when I went to call Tasha before bed. Again, the pitch was off. It wasnt merely the difference between A and A#, though. It modulated slowly, as if sliding up and back from A to A#. The tone wasnt as pure, either. There was static in the background. The wind outside had picked up, so I assumed it was affecting the ancient copper lines that crisscrossed the woodland county. The static waxed and waned with the modulating tone. I pressed my ear to the receiver, suddenly intrigued. There were voices in the static. I couldnt make out what they were saying over the interference and the tone, but they were unmistakably voices. There must have been some wire crosstalk over at the switching facility.

I dialed Tasha and we talked for a little while. While we spoke, the wind outside intensified. Earlier, when Id gone into town to get some groceries, the locals told me we were in for some snow. I assumed it was starting. Tasha and I were saying our goodnights when the power cut out. The room was utterly pitch black.

We finished up and I fumbled in the dark to hang the phone up. With a sinking feeling, I remembered Id forgotten to get new batteries for the two flashlights I kept in the kitchen. I carefully walked over to the desk and opened my laptop. Weak, pale light filled the room and cast bizarre shadows against the walls. Despite being 42 years old, I felt scared. I wanted to make a fire in the fireplace, but Id neglected to bring any wood inside. Its rare that I make a fire; Im always paranoid about accidentally burning the place down. Still, it was a risk I was willing to take in the face of the impending stygian blackness of the cabin once my laptop died.

I bundled up and went outside. It was somewhat brighter out there than in the cabin, and I could see snow was beginning to fall. There wasnt much, but with all the wind it still looked and felt like a blizzard. I grabbed an arm full of wood from under the awning on the side of the cabin and headed back inside. As soon as I opened the door, I heard it.

The phone had fallen from its cradle and the receiver was emitting extremely loud, dissonant tones. This time, the sounds were entirely unlike anything Id heard from a telephone. The tones swept through octaves like a damaged siren, frequently punctuated by bursts of static and, beneath it all, the unmistakable timbre of human voices. The hair on the back of my neck stood erect and my skins topography was reconstructed by gooseflesh. Buried inside the wailing of the dial tone and the blasts of white noise, I could make out individual words:

*DECLENSION. NEW. LUNATION. NEURULATION. GOD.*

The light from my laptop faded into nothingness. I gasped and dropped the wood Id been carrying. I rushed forward to hang up the phone, but I stumbled and fell, landing heavily on the floor with my head inches from the screaming receiver. The wailing and static stopped. Wind buffeted the wooden exterior of the cabin. Terrified and not knowing what to do, I reached for the receiver to hang it up. When my hand touched the plastic, an enormous crash rattled all sides of the cabin at once, knocking dishes from the cabinets and causing them to shatter on the kitchen floor. I screamed.

The phone began making noise again. It started with a normal dial tone, but quickly warbled and warped into a shrill cacophony of sirens, static, and voices. Somehow, I was impelled to put the shrieking receiver to my ear. I fought the impulse with all my strength, even pushing my left arm against my right to stop it from moving. It was futile. The receiver touched my ear and the sounds were replaced by a single, hideously loud voice:

*YOUR HOURS. YOU ARE HOURS. YOU ARE OURS. YOU ARE OURS.*

A needle of indescribably cold pain pushed through my ear. I felt its frigid length puncture the eardrum with a horrible snip sound, changing the the blaring voice to a distorted buzz. Still, I felt the pressure of the intense volume against the destroyed membrane as the pain traveled deeper and deeper into my head. Everything went white.

I woke up on the floor this morning with a splitting headache and pool of dried blood in my right ear. The events of the previous night flooded back and I scrambling to my feet in terror. The wreckage of the kitchen was strewn across the floor. Framed pictures of Tasha and me had fallen off the walls and shattered on the hardwood. Desperate for fresh air, I hurled myself toward the door and opened it. Surrounding the cabin, contrasting against the sunny snowscape, were thousands of dead birds. Each one had its head smashed with such force that its eyes had burst and its beak was splintered into unrecognizable fragments. Vertiginous nausea caused me to sway and nearly fall into the carcasses. I stumbled backward into the house and slammed the door.

I looked over at the phone. It was neatly placed on its cradle and looking as innocuous as any telephone in any house. I couldnt bring myself to pick it up and dial 911. Not after what happened. I pored through the fallen debris and found my keys. The legs of a drunkard carried me through the bird corpses to my truck. I pulled away from the cabin and somehow made it to the hospital without crashing.

Right now, Im writing this with a borrowed laptop from a bed in the hospital. My right eardrum is ruined. They told me Id experience vertigo for quite a while, but I was given medication to make the sensation less nauseating. The injury to my ear was not enough to keep me hospitalized. In fact, it was hardly enough for the ER staff to take seriously and they seemed irritated by my presence. That changed when they asked me how it happened. I explained it to them as best I could, but all I could see in their faces was bewilderment. Over and over they asked me to repeat myself, but after a while, I started to get frustrated.

One of them handed me a pen and paper and I simply wrote, What is so hard for you to understand? A young nurse asked me to tell them again what happened. She held her phone out in front of her and I saw she was recording a video. Again, I explained. They listened intently as I spoke, then the nurse stopped the recording. I shrugged my shoulders, wondering if recording me somehow got my story through their thick skulls. The nurse turned the phone toward me and I pressed play. I watched for a few seconds and started sobbing. On screen, when I opened my mouth to speak, all that came out was the shrill siren of the warped dial tone.

<TITLE> Fairfield County, part 1: Lake Mohegan and the Cascades </TITLE>

<TEXT> If youre coming from Bridgeport via I-95, take exit 24, turn right, then hang a left to go up Black Rock Turnpike until you see Burroughs Road. Take that right. Follow it down, past the house with the weird, light-up numbers, past the soccer field, and youll reach Fairfield Woods Road. Go right again, then take your first left at the stop sign onto Morehouse Highway. Follow Morehouse until the end.

The time I went this way with my boyfriend, Aaron, who was new to the area, he thought the only option at the bottom of Morehouse was to take a left. The route straight was obstructed by a locked metal gate covered with reflective orange tape. But I had a key.

Behind the gate lies a small, poorly-maintained road which leads around and down to a wooded area on the rear end of Lake Mohegan. Its a manmade lake that was once a gravel quarry back in the 50s. The town of Fairfield bought the then-defunct quarry in 1961 and routed the Mill River to fill it up, ultimately making a pleasant beach area for the locals. Once the quarry was full of water and the sand was brought in, the townsfolk came in droves. Both sides of the lake would attract bathers and sunseekers of all types. The main part of the lake always had three lifeguards on duty, but at the rear end of the lake, where its fed by the river, theres a deceptively strong current and no lifeguard stations.

After an unfortunate series of drownings in the 1970s, nearly all of whom were children neither strong enough to swim away from the current nor smart enough to avoid fighting it, the town decided no one should swim on that side of the lake. Most people listened, some didnt, and some of them also drowned. The area remained popular, though; especially the spot the locals call the Cascades. 

The Cascades consist of a series of minor waterfalls and rapids gushing through a narrow, rocky section about a mile up from where the river pours into the lake. The Cascades are surrounded by many square miles of woods gifted to the town by the General Electric company, whose corporate headquarters butts up against the far edge. On a bright, warm day, locals would enjoy walking through the woods along the well-marked paths. Some brave, albeit foolish, ones would dive from the highest ledge of the riverbank into the rushing water. Aside from the times when the water level was low, it was just deep enough to for divers to avoid serious injury.

When I was younger, the gate leading to the Cascades wasnt always locked. In fact, it was wide open from sunrise to sunset. Visitors were welcome to go inside, tour the woods, and walk along the river. After what happened that summer in 1987, though, town officials wanted to keep visitors to a minimum. It remained closed all throughout my childhood and adolescence, but my high school friends and I used to sneak in and explore.

At the insistence of my parents, when I turned 17, I got a job with the towns parks and recreation department doing basic maintenance and garbage collection. The pay was terrible, but I got to drive a big truck around and I had tons of time to myself. Id go from park to park, pulling gum from water fountains and tampons from swingsets and garbage from bins, then drive it over to the town dump at the end of the day. The dump had a big gate that was usually open, but after hours, it was closed to anyone who didnt have a key. Every maintenance worker employed by the town had one. And it was the same one that opened all the municipal gates in Fairfield, including the one behind Lake Mohegan.

Aaron and I pulled up to the gate. I got out, unlocked it, hopped back in the car, and we progressed down the crumbling roadway to a dilapidated parking area. We stepped out onto the cracked asphalt and hopped over the knee-high fence theyd erected to keep mountain bikers from terrorizing pedestrians on the trails. As we strolled through the woods toward the Cascades, we chatted and caught up. Itd been almost two months since wed seen one another.

I met Aaron online in an AOL chatroom earlier in the year. It was a local chat for gay men in Connecticut, and we hit it off pretty much immediately. He was a year older than me and a student at UCONN. Most Friday evenings, Id make the 90 minute drive up there, wed have a great time, then Sunday nights Id drive home and go to school the next morning, exhausted. My parents never had any issues with our relationship, aside from the initial concern that he might be some weird predator. They met him the first time he came to visit and discovered pretty quickly he was a good guy. Obviously, they made him sleep in the guest bedroom, but they had no problem with anything else. 

While we walked, Aaron marvelled at the beauty of the woods and the rushing waters of the river. I told him he should see it when the water level isnt so low - its almost scary how fast and deep the rapids near the Cascades can be after a storm. He asked me why the area was closed off to the public, so I told him the story.

In the summer of 1987, the area was dealing with a pretty bad drought. On top of that, it was an inordinately hot summer, so Lake Mohegan was packed solid with townsfolk looking to beat the heat. All those combined factors led to a series of problems. First, the lake, which had lost a decent amount of water to the drought, was warm as bathwater and a perfect breeding ground for all sorts of nasty things. Leeches were first, but only in one area to the far left of the lifeguard chairs. Then there was an algae bloom on the back side of the lake, which, despite every warning, didnt scare bathers away. A few got sick and one, who we later learned was an early and unaware carrier of the AIDS virus, died from a specific type of infection they assumed he picked up at the lake.

When the conditions at Lake Mohegan deteriorated to the point where most people didnt go in the water anymore, the river and the Cascades became the new hot spot. Since the river was always flowing, there was no algae or threat of infections from stagnant water. However, the water level was dramatically lower than usual. Divers usually cannonballed or belly-flopped from the rock walls and safely splashed into the river, but every so often, someone would jump straight down and get hurt. Most of the injuries were limited to badly lacerated feet and toes, but every couple days thered be at least one broken ankle. There were calls for the town to close off the area until the water level was higher, but all they did was put up a few signs that said Dive At Your Own Risk with a silly illustration of someone diving and cracking their head open.

As the summer wore on and the drought got worse, so did the injuries. It culminated in a tragedy that made national news. A hideously stupid father and mother, while being videotaped by a relative, laughed and waved to the camera before diving headfirst off the ledge as they held the hands of their their adult autistic son. All three smashed their faces into the rocks below and broke their necks. All three died. The subsequent investigation showed the water, which was normally just under 8 feet deep at that spot, was barely 5 and a half.

That incident prompted the indefinite closing of the Cascades. The town didnt put out guards or arrest anyone who ventured in, but the installation of the gate prevented cars from entering and that eliminated the vast majority of visitors. Those seeking relief from the heat ended up going across town to Jennings and Penfield beach, and that, for the most part, was that.

Aaron had tears in his eyes when I mentioned the part about the autistic son. His uncle suffered from autism and Aaron frequently spoke about the mans fragility. I changed the subject as our walk brought us to the Cascades hed been hearing about for the last 30 minutes. I could tell he was underwhelmed. Even though it was almost 80 degrees on that early April afternoon, the trees were still barren and unappealing to look at. The water level was pitiful. Thered been no snow during the winter and hardly any rain, either, so the river, which usually raged at this time of year as the snow melted, trickled pitifully. We peered over the edge of the cliff where the parents and their son had died. It looked no deeper than the 5 and a half feet it was on that day. 

I sighed and told Aaron I was sorry for building the whole thing up. His face brightened and told me it was no problem. He was happy to be spending time with me. I winked and told him Id make it up to him anyway. I looked around. There was no one anywhere nearby. I kissed him and pulled him close to me. He was eager to return the affection, and after about 45 seconds we were naked and I was on my knees in front of him. When it was his turn to return the favor, I sat on the cool rocks on the side of the cliff and dangled my legs over the edge. He grinned and knelt beside me, moving his head downward with enthusiastic purpose. 

I let him perform for a minute or two, enjoying the sensation. Once I felt his mouth release me, I picked up the rock Id sat next to and drove it into his head. Aarons face dropped heavily into my lap as blood oozed from the chipped wreckage at the top of his skull. I dropped the rock into the water and pushed him off the cliff. He plunged face first into the shallow water, his body stopping abruptly as his head struck the bottom. He tipped sideways and floated, facedown, before getting stuck in a tangle of branches on the riverbank. 

Walking down to the riverbank, I flipped Aaron onto his back and pulled him ashore. He was undoubtedly dead. The exhilaration I felt was beyond anything Id experienced before or since. I couldnt wait to tell the others. Wed been talking for a while about how wed each do something like this, but I was the first to go through with it. Anna, Dmitri, and Lisa all eventually got their chances, and Ill be happy to tell their stories soon, but let me wrap this up. 

I washed the small bit of Aarons blood off my hand and thigh. Then I got dressed, took the keys from his pocket, and headed toward the lot. I drove over to the nearby church on Morehouse Highway and banged on the office door. An elderly clergyman opened it and I told him, with sobbing panic in my voice, that my friend had gotten hurt in a diving accident.

The police questioned me for a few hours, but I was released to my parents later that night. Aarons death was ultimately ruled an accident. I played the grieving boyfriend for nearly six months before I felt it was safe to show Id moved on. 

I cant believe its been almost 20 years since that April afternoon. My husband has no idea. My kids have no idea. Nor will they. I had the opportunity of a lifetime and I was determined to seize it. One of the most amazing feelings in the world is to know youve gotten to satisfy a curiosity held by so many people either incapable or too afraid to take action. My husband, Francisco, often says how proud he is of me. I know hes talking about my career advancement and how well I help raise our kids, but as he strokes my hair while were snuggled in bed and he tells me about the pride and love he feels, I tell myself its because Im willing to take that extra step toward success. Toward the fulfilment of my dreams. And, above all, toward self-actualization.

<TEXT> I spent three years as an IT contractor at the US military base, Camp Lemonnier, in Djibouti. Our firm had been hired to perform a massive upgrade to all the information systems on the base. It was only supposed to take a year and a half. As these things usually go, it went enormously over budget and took twice as long as wed estimated. I didnt mind. One of my dreams growing up was to travel to Africa, so when I was presented with the opportunity, I jumped at it. Since I dont have much family and wasnt in a relationship at the time, I had no strings attached when I boarded that plane with my colleagues.

The base offered free basic housing and other facilities to their visiting contractors, which some of us took, but I wanted to live in town and embrace the culture. Djibouti City was nearby, extremely inexpensive, and replete with all the cultural experiences I ever wanted. I met wonderful people, learned a little French and Arabic, and discovered their local cuisine is not only some of the best on Earth, but far less fattening than American food. I mustve lost 25 pounds while still eating like a king. As our IT project dragged on, I almost wished it would take forever. I just didnt want to leave.

But, of course, all good things must come to an end. In April of 2005, with our task complete, we were on a plane back to Burlington via a New York layover. The team was given a month off to reconnect with everything back home. Those of us who didnt have homes or families to come back to were put up in hotels until we could find places of our own. The hotel room was so much bigger and nicer than the tiny apartment in Djibouti to which Id grown accustomed. It felt downright decadent to get to sprawl out and get comfortable. And as much as I loved the Djiboutian food, knowing a bacon cheeseburger could be room-serviced up to me 24 hours a day was a damn good feeling. I took advantage of it many, many times.

After being home for three days, though, a rather unpleasant situation arose. Im not going to get graphic because we all have our own intimate knowledge of such a thing, but Ill just say I was terribly constipated. Three days stretched into four, then five. I was extraordinarily uncomfortable at that point. Most of the advice online said to wait it out and make sure I was staying hydrated. I drank bottle after bottle of water, but, to my chagrin, my desired result continued its elusion. 

Day number six was a repeat performance of the previous five. On the seventh day, I didnt rest. I hauled my bloated self over to the pharmacy and bought some laxatives. Just the thought of the things grossed me out, but the promise of their efficacy did great work to quell my emotional misgivings. I went back to the hotel, read the directions, swallowed the suggested dose, and waited.

The medication acted quickly. Again, in an effort to avoid the all-too-familiar details, Ill simply say the pressure and discomfort ended abruptly. The only pain, as Id expected, was located on the, well, exit. Unfortunately, here is where I must start a period of elaboration. I assure you, it is not scatological. It is, however, profoundly disturbing.

As I went to clean myself, I noticed an obstruction in the area. It was not what I, or likely you, are thinking. No, as I learned rather quickly, it was far, far worse. I peered down between my legs and saw the most horrifying sight in my 42 years of life. Dangling into the the bowl was a thick rope of tangled, grayish-white worms. I screamed with such terrific ferocity that I immediately damaged my vocal cords, causing the outburst to sound as if it were produced by a dilapidated chainsaw. I flexed the muscle through which the creatures were hanging, hoping to dislodge them. Nothing.

Needless to say, I was panicking. I had no idea what to do, but I knew I had to get the things out of me. All my life, Id been terrified of bugs and insects of all sorts. Having these monsters infesting me was beyond any level of abject horror I couldve imagined. The next move I made, I would later learn, is not a recommended method of removal.

I reached behind me and grasped the writhing column in my fist. I involuntarily retched as I felt the thickness of the parasitic invaders against my palm. All bunched together, they were the diameter of toilet paper tube. I squeezed the atrocious things and pulled as hard as I could. For a moment, my only respite from the terror was the impossibly acute agony produced by my pulling action. A tearing sensation of pain exploded right below my sternum - practically in my chest. With dawning realization that the creatures were far deeper in my body than I could deal with myself, my panic mixed with deep helplessness.

Remember, this was 2005. Personal cell phones were not nearly as ubiquitous as they are today. While I had one in Africa, Id turned it in upon my arrival home. It wouldnt have worked on our network, anyway, and my company had yet to give our group new Blackberry devices. What that meant was I had to get up and walk to the bedside telephone. I distinctly remember the wet slapping of the repulsive rope on my bare thighs as I waddled across the room. I dialed the front desk, not 911 for some idiotic reason I cant remember, and simply said, medical emergency in room 1142. I stood there, naked from the waist down, with a tail of twitching parasites hanging out of me.

The hotel staff whod been trained in CPR and other basic emergency services arrived first. Without knocking, the used their own key to barge in. Each of the three looked puzzled, and, within a span of ten seconds, realized why theyd been called. One by one, they turned varying shades of white. The largest of the group, a man with a name tag labelling him as Jeremy, sat down on the bed and promptly fainted backward. The other two, Maria and Tyshawn, did their best to maintain composure. They asked me if I was having trouble breathing or experiencing chest pains or blurred vision. As the procedural questions dragged on, the real EMTs arrived.

Hardened as EMTs are, one of the two men who arrived audibly whispered Jesus fucking Christ when he saw why theyd been summoned. Wrapping a towel around my waist, something I hadnt even thought of in my panic, they helped me onto a stretcher and we went down the elevator and into the waiting ambulance. At the hospital, the ER doctor in charge of me just said, well thats a pretty bad case, huh? I nodded, stupidly.

A few doses of specialized medication and two days later, I expelled the invading creatures. I was told I probably got them from eating contaminated food in Africa. Also, apparently I was lucky that I didnt have to have surgery. Sometimes when theyre as deep as mine were, surgerys the only option.

So, its almost 11 years later. I had a few scans in the months that followed my hospital stay to make sure I didnt have anything new growing inside me, but each time I was clean as a whistle. Still, as you might imagine, Im haunted by the experience. Worst was the feeling of how thick and heavy the tangle of worms felt in my hand. That, and how impossibly long the things were. I swear, I was convinced theyd made their way into my chest and were coiling around my heart, ready to squeeze the life from me. But all is well, I keep telling myself. Nothing is out of the ordinary. 

Its interesting, too, because the worms themselves dont scare me anymore. Im traumatized by the experience and the stress resulting from it, of course, but as the years went by, I could easily study the things online and in textbooks without shrinking away. In fact, Im almost drawn to them. Today, Id venture to guess I know more about that genus and species than even some experts in that field. Its strange how our experiences can shape our interests, isnt it? 

A couple years ago, I quit my job in technology. Using the money Id been saving, I started a food truck. The customer base started off small, but it grew pretty quickly thanks to word of mouth and social media. My customers love the cuisine and regulars line up every day to enjoy the outstanding Djiboutian food made by the quirky white American. As the business flourished and customers came in droves, all the diners were happy to report to me how they finally found a diet food that works. Even though hearing that warms my heart, I still experience a pang of jealousy that makes me feel a little empty inside.

<TEXT> Maybe one of you can offer me some advice? I dont have insurance and I cant afford a trip to the ER. It doesnt seem life threatening, though, so I might wait it out. Ive always been a bit of a hypochondriac and I bet Im just overreacting. Still, if anyone is interested in coming over and checking me out, just send me a message. Id really appreciate it.

I was walking through the wooded area behind my home and I found this weird black stuff oozing out of a rock. It was shiny and made me think of jellied obsidian. Id never seen anything quite like it before. Since I moved out of the city ten years ago, I frequently walked around the many acres of woods near the house and never saw anything weirder than a squirrel eating a dead hawk. So this was new to me.

I took a branch and poked at the stuff. It resisted a little before it broke open, causing a more liquidy version to flow out from inside. I grabbed a smaller stick and scooped up a tiny bit of the stuff and walked back to the house. Part of me was worried that it fell from a plane or something and might be a toxic threat to the environment.

When I got home, I scraped the goo onto a dish I never used and threw the stick in the garbage. I shone some light on the plate, and I swear, the stuff moved a little. Its not like it jumped up and made scary tentacles or anything like that; no, it just kind of spread out in a weird way. Almost like how jellyfish try to hide in the sand when they feel threatened. After I killed the light, it gradually reassumed its original shape. My guess was that the heat from the lamp made it melt.

I decided to wait until tomorrow morning and bring it to the local university just to be on the safe side. I dont know what it was about the stuff, but I was really, really uneasy around it. When I left for an hour or two and went to the store to get groceries, I returned to find the plate empty and a streak of black grease going off the plate, across the counter, and onto the floor. There wasnt a trail indicating where it went after that.

Honestly, I was a little freaked out. I bent down and looked all over the place and never found the stuff. But it found me.

At first, I thought the sensation on my bare ankle was just a mosquito, so I slapped at it without thinking. Obviously, looking back, that was the wrong idea. The black stuff spread out all over my palm, then the rest of my hand, then my arm, side, chest, back, and the rest of me. Long story short, Im completely covered in the black substance. But heres the thing, and its why Im not particularly worried: it feels amazing.

I know, I know, it sounds weird. But in all honesty, Ive never felt anything like it. In fact, I was so taken by the sensation that I went back outside, over to the rock where the stuff was, and pulled as much of it off as I could and brought it into the house. Now, like I said in the beginning, I do think Im having some sort of medical issue. Its definitely not something Ive ever experienced before or even heard of, so I think its important to get checked out. But still, I cant get over how great the experience is. The stuff smells wonderful, too. And right now, as it spreads over my tongue, it tastes better than anything Ive ever put in my mouth. Please, anyone who might be interested in investigating either for their own curiosity or as a medical precaution, just leave a message right here and Ill give you directions to my home. Id be so happy if someone came over.

Please. Come visit me. Come visit us.

<TEXT> When Danielle was growing up, Ron and I knew she was plagued by depression. It was the same demon both my husband and I had to face daily, so we had no trouble recognizing the signs. As her condition worsened, she wouldnt bother hiding the cuts on her arms. Once she graduated high school, we couldnt force her to see a psychologist or get any type of positive intervention. She just sat in her room with the door closed and ate no more than five meals a week. If she ever went out, it was long after her father and I had gone to bed.

Shed been picked up by the police a number of times for trespassing in graveyards or standing on the rooftops of local businesses. She never stood close enough to the edge to make the police think it was a suicide attempt, though, so she wasnt held for psychological observation. They chalked it up to her being a rebellious kid and sent her home.

Danielles behavior took a significant toll on the relationship between Ron and me. Like I said, we both knew depression. We also dealt with its manifestations in different ways. I was a yeller and a crier, Ron was taciturn and brooding. But I knew his silence could be broken by occasional fits of rage.

One night, Danielle was brought home by the police for the third time in as many months. After the officer left, I began screaming at Danielle for being so reckless. She stared at me, muttering obscenities under her breath like she usually did in those situations. Ron, whod been observing and glowering as I shouted, strode across the room and slapped Danielle across her face. Hard. She fell sideways, her head denting the sheetrock of the wall beside her. She lept to her feet but he hit her again. That time, she stayed down. As I rushed over to see if she was okay, Ron stormed out of the house.

Aside from a nasty handprint on the side of her face, Danielle was fine. Once shed gotten over the shock of being struck, she bolted out of the kitchen, up the stairs, and slammed the door of her bedroom. Neither of us saw her for a couple days after that, but we heard her walking around. She didnt leave at night, either; Ron stayed up to make sure of that. As much as I hated him for striking her, I hated myself even more for hoping hed actually knocked some sense into her.

A year passed. I drifted away from Ron and he drifted away from me. We were strangers in the cavernous wreckage of the home wed built together. I wouldnt sleep in the same room as him, so he slept in the basement. I moved all my paints and canvases upstairs so Id never have to see his face. That July, Danielle tried to kill herself. Had she not puked up the pills and wine before the paramedics arrived, she wouldve been dead. She was hospitalized until September. When she was released, she was no different. No better. And she returned to a home where resentfulness had undergone unchecked growth since she left.

On her 19th birthday, Danielle disappeared. We figured it was another one of her rooftop or graveyard romps, but she didnt come back. After four days, we called the police. Two days later, they found her car on the side of a wooded road 20 miles away. Three days after that, they told us theyd found an empty bottle of pills and backpack in the woods, torn to shreds and covered with blood. We identified the pack as the one we got for Danielle a couple years earlier. 12 days after finding the backpack, the police called off the search. We were told if shed attempted suicide and gotten dragged off by wolves or a bear, her remains might never be found. And they werent. We buried an empty coffin a week later.

Months went by. Ron lost his job not long after the funeral because he just wouldnt show up to work anymore. I still had mine, and my salary was more than enough for the both of us. Still, I despised myself for continuing to support the man. I spent more and more time in the office, desperately trying to avoid going home. The few coworkers who knew about everything that was going on tried to get me to leave him. I always refused. He was the man I married. Things had to get better someday.

I came home from work on a Friday evening in early October. As always, I made my way to the kitchen to start dinner for myself and Ron. He knew to come get his food after he heard me going up the stairs to eat in my bedroom, so I was surprised to hear his footsteps as I diced onions, carrots, and celery for the stew. I bristled with anger and wouldnt turn around. I didnt want to see him before I ate.

Danielle and I have a surprise for you, he announced. Just hearing the name of my daughter made me wince. I turned around with a grimace etched into my face, ready to scream at him for invoking her memory. The grimace turned into a look of desperate, uncomprehending horror.

Standing next to Ron was Danielle - bound by the wrists and gagged. Her spindly arms and gaunt face had horrible, scarred ligature marks from the constant friction of the rope holding the bindings in place. Her hair had grown down to her naked, bloody thighs. In my delirious state of shock, Id failed to notice the little bundle in my husbands arms. He unwrapped a small towel from around it and presented it to me. My knees weakened and the room around me desaturated and blurred. I reached out and instinctively clutched the infant to my chest as it began to scream.

I was hoping we could start over, Ron whispered, tears filling his eyes. He pulled Danielle and me and the baby into an embrace. 

Can we start over? Please?

<TEXT> Where did they say theyre going again?, asked Laura.

I sighed. Dad said he was going to put gas in the car and mom needed to use the bathroom. The one heres broken.

I studied Lauras face, knowing she was close to tears. She never wanted to be too far from our parents. Even though we could see them across the street at the gas station, Laura was worried theyd abandon her and shed be stuck with her big sister forever.

Look, I told her, pointing out the enormous, floor-to-ceiling window. Theres dad next to the gas pump. And theres mom running toward the bathroom. I guess she really had to pee. That got a giggle out of Laura, but I could tell the waterworks were imminent.

What if they leave us here?, she whispered, the latter half of the inquiry nearly inaudible under her burgeoning whimpers.

Laura, its okay. I did my best to sound confident and authoritative; Laura needed to believe with certainty theyd be returning momentarily. Otherwise, Id be left with a blubbering wreck as we waited for our food in the middle of a crowded diner. Shes four, I reminded myself. You were scared of everything when you were four.

My sister took a loud, deep breath and exhaled slowly. Its a technique I taught her for when she felt sad or scared. A tear dripped out of her right eye and slid down her cheek. She wiped it away, but no others came. She stared intently out the large window at our parents, who were getting back in the car.

Our food arrived. All four of us had ordered some variety of grilled cheese. Lauras was on white bread with American cheese, and she picked it up and started shoveling the thing into her mouth. I didnt bother to tell her to wait for mom and dad before eating. I was hungry too. I picked up my cheddar on rye and took a bite.

Down the street, a gasoline tanker was making its way in our direction. It appeared to be going much faster than any of the cars Id seen on that road as we sat there. Mounting dread formed knots in my viscera.

I dont know what caused me to push my head back against the soft leather of the booth and press my face into its corner, but when the truck careened into the gas station across the street and exploded, shattering the thick glass of the diner windows, I was shielded from the majority of shrapnel and the blast of heat. Laura wasnt.

By the time Id collected myself enough to react, I saw the left side of my sisters head was blistered and encrusted with glass. She stared at me, motionless, in obvious shock. Then her hand rose to touch the side of her face. The touch became a rub. Blood oozed out of her small palm as it was lacerated by the jagged edges. She looked to her right and picked up the grilled cheese that had fallen onto her seat, wiggled it slightly to get the biggest shards of glass off, and began to eat.

The ringing in my ears had drowned out the overture of hysteria playing around us. But, gradually, screams filled my ears. I ignored them. All I could do was look outside at the hellscape of fire and twisted metal. I saw our car. A Subaru station wagon. It was facing in our direction, but upside down and on fire.

I watched a shape crawl out of the drivers side window. Its clothes and hair were gone. All it looked like was a figure drawn in red and black. Still, I was with it enough to know it was our father. He hobbled over to the other side of the car and pulled another figure from the wreck. Mom. She didnt move. Dad collapsed to his knees in front of her, and after a few moments, turned toward the diner. Id noticed Lauras shock had worn off and shed begun howling in fear and pain.

I tried to get her to calm down. It was an exercise in futility; even I was crying and near panic. I held her hands and babbled, its okay, its okay. In the corner of my eye, I saw movement. I jerked my head around to see dad moving toward the diner. He couldnt run, but he was hobbling on what looked like half a left foot. As he got closer, I could see how horrifically injured he was. Laura noticed him coming, too, but didnt recognize him whatsoever. She screamed.

Dad made his way to us as the wail of sirens grew louder. The details of his injuries became clearer with every awkward step. Despite being burned, he was sopping wet. Fluid dripped from hideous burns on his head, chest, and legs. He made it to our table and reached out, grabbing Laura. Laura twisted in his grasp and scratched his arm, gouging deep tracks in the destroyed flesh. He pulled her out and held her tightly.

I clambered onto the table and through the window and stood, stupidly, not knowing what to do or how to help. Dads voice wheezed out of his lipless mouth. Over Lauras screams, it was hard to make out what he was saying. He clutched my sister against his oozing chest and, suddenly, she realized who he was. She abruptly stopped shrieking and merely whimpered.

Dad looked up at me and I got closer. He repeated what he said before, over and over, his voice gradually tapering into gurgling nothingness. Were still a family. Were still a family. Were still a family. Were still a family. I looked across the street at the motionless, charred figure next to the Subaru. Then I looked at dad, still cradling Laura despite having slumped over.

I gently took Laura from our fathers lifeless arms. She sobbed into my chest as I ran forward, across the street. I darted between blackened vehicles and unidentifiable wreckage. Still a family, I thought to myself, and closed my eyes. The emergency workers managed to restrain me before we could reunite with our parents in the fire.

<TEXT> When I was a kid, the nurse at my elementary school, Mr. Lansing, performed weekly lice checks on all the students. He used to be a doctor before he retired and took the position at the school because he loved children and wanted to make sure they were healthy and happy. I liked Mr. Lansing. He had a soft voice, a shiny bald head, and was very hard of hearing. Hed take a metal comb that hed always warm up in his hands first and carefully move my hair around to see if there was anything crawling on my scalp.

One time, he whispered uh oh and held a tiny bug between his thumb and forefinger for me to see. I started to cry. He told me not to worry and brought me down to the his office. Even though I liked Mr. Lansing, I hated his office. It was right next to the boiler room so it was always hot. The few times I had to go there when I was sick, I sweated a lot and felt super thirsty. To my pleasant surprise, the boilers hadnt been turned on that day because of the warm weather outside. The office was just like any other room.

Mr. Lansing sat me down on the little cot and perched on a stool in front of me. His gray eyes glinted with reflected light and he smiled as he talked with me about head lice and what would happen next. The most important thing, he stressed, was that I shouldnt worry about it. It happens to almost all kids at least once - its why he inspects every student in the school a few times each month. He asked if I was okay, and I nodded and wiped my eyes. He smiled again.

Before calling my parents to pick me up, Mr. Lansing said he needed to use the comb in my hair again. I turned around and he got to work. He told me he was taking out as many of the lice as he could so my parents would only have to deal with the eggs when I got home. He combed and combed, scraping the side of the instrument against the side of an old coffee can to collect the bugs to throw away afterward. 

When he was done, my parents were called and Mr. Lansing explained to them the process of removing the remaining lice and their eggs. Mom looked pale but Dad said it was no problem and hed have me ready to come back to school in a day or two. We went home, stopping first at the drugstore to get some special shampoo.

Dad shampooed my hair over the sink and used a metal comb to pull the remaining lice and eggs out of my hair. It hurt and the comb got stuck a lot. After a few hours, he was finished. While Dad was working on my hair, Mom took all my sheets and blankets and clothes and stuffed animals and either threw them in the washing machine at the highest temperature or sealed them in plastic bags that I wasnt allowed to open for six months. Once all that was accomplished, Mom and Dad checked one another, determined they were clean, and that was that. I was back in school the next day.

A month later, Mr. Lansing discovered 52 new cases of lice. I was one of them. The principal wanted to close the school, but Mr. Lansing talked her out of it. He sought and received permission from the parents to treat their children one-on-one to ensure the lice and eggs were properly removed. The parents would still be responsible for cleaning the house and washing everything, but that was out of the schools control. 

I remember when it was my turn, Mr. Lansing had me sit back in a very comfortable chair and I positioned my head over the sink. He ran warm water through my long hair and lovingly massaged my scalp. I remember thinking how much more practiced and gentle he was than my father had been a month earlier. I smiled. Carefully, Mr. Lansing began to comb the bugs away. I asked if he needed to use that special shampoo. He needed me to repeat myself so he could hear the question, but in response he shook his head and told me if the comb is used properly, the results would be the same without any nasty chemicals.

Mr. Lansing worked and worked, stopping every so often to scrape the side of the comb against the coffee can, and then resumed the process. It took a little over an hour, but then I was all set. My hair felt great and clean and I thanked Mr. Lansing and walked out of his office.

Later that afternoon, as I was getting into my moms car to go home, I realized Id left my sweater on the shelf in Mr. Lansings office. Mom told me to go in and get it. I ran back inside and down to his office. Without thinking to knock, I opened the door. Mr. Lansing was standing with his back to the door, facing the blank wall. He hadnt heard me come in. 

His shirt was off and I was surprised to see how hairy his torso was. He reached into the coffee can by the sink. When he withdrew his fist, I saw it was covered in tiny gray bumps. I dared to take another step into the office to confirm what I already knew. I felt sick to my stomach. Mr. Lansing rubbed his lice-coated hand over his chest and shoulders. From where I stood, I could see tiny little bugs crawling through the hair on his back. I saw him start to turn and I quickly backed out but left the door slightly ajar. I peered through the crack and watched as he continued to rub the bugs into his belly and arms. I involuntarily gagged as he licked his hand clean. 

Mr. Lansing heard me gag and whirled around to see me watching through the narrow opening. I was terrified hed grab me, but all he did was pull the door closed and I heard a lock engage on the other side. I ran back to the car where mom was impatiently waiting. I never told her, nor anyone, what Id seen until now. I thought about it, but was too scared about what might happen to me. Mr. Lansing never returned to school, and Im sure hes long gone, but every time I feel the slightest itch anywhere on my body, Im reminded of him.

<TEXT> We were in the final stages of testing a custom drug ordered by a large investment bank in China. Its purpose was to help their traders and programmers focus and make quick, rational, and emotionally-detached decisions, without the cardiovascular or dependency risks associated with traditional ADHD medication. The drug was well-tolerated and the test subjects showed marked improvement on the battery of cognitive and job-specific tests the bank had provided. The drug, we estimated, would be ready in a month. Our team was ecstatic; if the drug worked well for the bank, we would seek FDA approval of a slightly-modified version for the general public. Our company would profit enormously.

A few of my colleagues had tried the drug themselves in the latter portions of its testing phase. While such sampling was prohibited, it was impossible to prevent. They, too, had their work quality and general focus improve while under its effect. After listening to Rakesh gush endlessly about how much hed benefitted from the drug, I figured it was time to give it a shot. I was used to ADHD medication. Until about a month ago, Id taken both Adderall and Wellbutrin to aid my own attention issues. I only stopped because the last 15 years of daily usage had made me nearly immune to the focus-enhancing effects. I didnt want to increase the dosage and stress my heart. Since our drug used an entirely different mechanism of action, I was excited to see if Id benefit as much as everyone else.

Around 10:15pm, I swallowed the tiny capsule with a mouthful of water. Id been stuck working late with Rakesh, Priya, and Jian. We were going over data from the test subjects and attempting to glean usable information for our transition to the modified, FDA version of the drug. About 20 minutes after I took the pill, I felt a burst of energy. The statistics wed been working on appeared much less daunting and I felt like I could single-handedly accomplish the entire task. Rakesh noticed and asked if I wanted to work on the harder stuff by myself to see what the drug could do. I nodded enthusiastically and he went to get something to eat. Priya did the same a little while later.

Jian and I stared at our respective computer screens and pored over data. As the moments went by, I began to feel unwell. The sensation wasnt physical; it was unlike the nausea and frenetic energy I would get from taking Adderall. This was vastly different. I felt like I was floating and seeing things from a vantage point overhead. I watched as I was gradually replaced by a dead man who used to be me. He was overcome by an incomprehensibly powerful thirst for blood. Blood, he knew with a certainty greater than anything in existence, was only thing that might help him return to life. I became him, and he became no one. A null consciousness dispassionately observed from above.

The dead thing rose from its chair, walked over to Jian, and bit his neck directly at the carotid artery. Its teeth sank deep, and before Jian could react, an enormous mouthful of flesh was pulled away. For ten minutes, the dead thing sucked and swallowed the gouting blood while its immense strength held Jians shuddering body. Blood slid down the dead things esophageal transitway and splashed into its stomach. It couldnt recognize any sensation of fullness. 

The flood from Jians throat had diminished to a trickle. The dead thing needed more. It tore Jians neck open entirely, plunged its face into the warm chasm, and scraped its teeth over every bit of flesh it could reach. It chewed the meat to release any remaining fluid. The dead thing reached the spinal cord and howled in crushing, unfulfilled frustration. It pushed its fingers between Jians ribs. They sank inside his chest, and the dead thing pulled the bones apart. Again, the dead thing ravenously extracted all it could. The mans legs were next. Then his buttocks, back, and face. Jians remaining blood mixed with the dead things saliva and dropped into its belly.

The dead thing crouched in a greasy puddle of hideous gore next to the flayed skeleton of Jian. It involuntarily vomited what it had consumed. As it lapped up the wasted blood, the door opened and Rakesh walked in. Before he could see the atrocity that had taken place, the dead thing leapt at him. The leap used more strength than the ligaments in its right knee could bear, and it stumbled, grabbing onto Rakeshs leg as it fell. It bit rapidly, over and over, loosening its teeth against the shinbone before maneuvering around to tear away his Achilles tendon. Rakeshs leg buckled and he fell. 

The dead thing attacked his belly and pushed its head into the cavity, desperately looking for a source of blood. It reached under the ribs with both hands and pushed outward. Rakeshs chest cavity burst open. The dead thing discarded the mans heart and locked its lips around the pulmonary artery and sucked. Hot blood cascaded down its throat, making no dent in its thirst. It screamed in desperation as it drank. As it had done with Jian, it began to chew Rakeshs flesh once the flow had stopped.

While the dead thing chewed the remaining fluid out of Rakeshs remains, it began to regain a sense of identity. Not entirely; I, which I then realized could be called I, existed as a dichotomous split between autonomy and impulse. The first physical sensation to return to normal was my appetite. My desperate thirst transitioned into impossibly powerful nausea. Again, I ejected the contents of my stomach onto the floor. I was impelled to kneel over that which Id released, as if to swallow it again, but I had regained a tenuous bit of control over my motor functions by that point. 

I tried to stand. My right knee slipped out of place and I crashed to the floor. Another sensation, pain, returned and overwhelmed me. Not just my knee, but my shoulder and fingers and teeth. Apparently as I was destroying Rakesh, he had stabbed me countless times with his pen. Bits and pieces of memory, now in the first person rather than the third, coalesced into a series of horrifying recollections. Id broken my fingers with the force of my tearing through Jians ribs. My teeth were loose from attempting to bite through Rakeshs shinbone. 

The final physical sensation to return was taste. Copper, salt, bile, and other, unmentionable flavors coated my palate in a thick, oily residue. I gagged and dragged my broken fingers over the slick surface of my tongue in an attempt to rid myself of the ghastly taste. It was then Priya returned to the office. Shed been texting as she walked in and hadnt noticed the scene until she slipped in a puddle of blood and nearly fell. She looked at the destruction, screamed, and ran. I sat in the corner, knees hugged to my chest, sobbing and retching.

Both our company and the investment bank were able use their respective connections to purge Priyas emergency call from the police logs. The local authorities and the individual responders to the scene were all given enormous amounts of money for their silence. I was neither arrested nor prosecuted. 

For days, though, I underwent test after invasive test. The results showed an unexpected interaction between the Wellbutrin, which was still in my system after a month of non-use, and one of the compounds in our new drug. Other subjects had been on Wellbutrin while in the test groups, but none had reported ill-effects. My incident was chalked up as an anomaly, and labeled as a Cotard delusion; a poorly-known syndrome where the affected lose their sense of identity and believe they are either dead, immortal, or both. 

Neither our company nor the Chinese bank were willing to delay the deployment of the drug, and a few months ago, specific employees of the bank were required to take the medication. The banks next earnings report was beyond even the most optimistic analysts estimations. The drug is now being modified slightly and getting prepared to undergo FDA scrutiny. Other than Priya, the higher-ups in both our company and the bank, and a few select doctors, no one knows about what happened that night. Rakesh and Jians families were told they died in a chemical accident and each family received $50 million. 

I work in the same capacity, every day, in the office next to where I murdered those men. Its since been turned into a file room, but I frequently have to visit it as part of my job. Every time I set foot inside, I can see myself chewing the flesh of my former friends. I feel my stomach fill with their blood and remember the desperate, unquenchable thirst driving me to get more. And even in the comforting safety of my home, Im still overwhelmed by the taste.

<TEXT> Im sharing the story because I was forced to sit through it during New Years Eve dinner and Im so freaked out and god damn itchy that I need to get it out of my system. Im sure some of you are going to breeze on by this little tantrum here and go right to the meat of the story because youre thinking, hey, Ive got a strong stomach. Well, go for it. 

Boring stuff out of the way: he was drafted, and since he was short and skinny, he was a perfect tunnel rat. Those were the guys who wriggled their way through the ridiculously narrow tunnels the Viet Cong used to transport personnel and weapons, set boobytraps, and all that. And when I say narrow, I mean narrow. [Heres a pic.](http://i.imgur.com/qRh25k9.jpg)

So, gramps was wriggling around in a tunnel one day and a few bad things happened. First, the two other people with him got killed by a solitary VC while they were standing around the hole. Being a few feet underground and about twenty feet through meant grandpa couldnt see who attacked them or know if anyone survived. He later learned he was the only one left alive, but he assumed the VC attacker would soon start throwing grenades into the tunnel and hed be done for. After a few minutes with no sign of any incoming attack, grandpa breathed a sigh of relief and starting moving forward again. A little while later, though, it starting pouring rain. The tunnel began to fill with water.

Now, in an unfinished, unsupported tunnel like he was in, a rainstorm usually meant death for a tunnel rat. Hed heard horror stories from the squadmates whod lost others underground, never to be seen again. He figured hed be another. But he wasnt going to go out without a fight.

He crawled forward. With him, he carried a small pistol and a Fulton flashlight. Originally, hed been sent down to ambush some VC soldiers who were thought to be hidden in one of the tunnels larger chambers. Hed crawl through, surprise them, blow their brains out, and wiggle his way back out. At least, thats how his first three tunnel trips had gone. This one, his fourth, wasnt going so well.

The tunnel narrowed as he crawled. Ahead of him, he heard rushing water. He thought it might mean the main chamber was nearby. He was wrong. The sound was the muddy ground above him sloshing downward, sealing the tunnel ahead. This is where he started to panic. He knew he wasnt particularly deep in the ground, maybe two and a half feet, but if he didnt start clawing upward through the ground really, really fast, hed be a dead man. So he clawed. His fingernails tore off and his hands got cut up really bad, but he was able to get part of his arm and face out of the mud. 

He was unable to move any farther. His lower back was pushed hard into the dirt and the angle had him bent into an elongated U shape. His legs were trapped. Above him, a square foot of light shone through where hed escape if he werent stuck.  He knew if it started to storm again, hed drown.

But the rain didnt come. Insects did. Ants were first. Luckily, they werent the big red ones everyone over there was terrified of. The ones with the bite that felt like you got shot. These were tiny black ones, but there were lots of them. He assumed when the tunnel flooded, they were driven from their homes. Now they crawled over his scalp, face, and neck. They didnt bite, but they tickled and itched. Those which found their way onto his lips were licked off and swallowed; he figured hed be going a while without food.

After a while, the ants lost interest. Flies became a problem, though. To see why, you need to know the position in which he was stuck. The twisted, awkward angle of his body left one arm stretched out in front of him, but his shoulder and upper back were immobile. So, he had a bit of movement in his upper arm, wrist, and hand, but anything below his elbow might as well have been paralyzed. Why is this relevant? Because his armpit was exposed. Not by much; maybe an inch of clearance, but that was more than enough for the flies. And they were very, very attracted to the warm, moist pit.

Over the course of an hour, 20 to 30 fat, brownish-black flies dove into his right armpit. They stayed for a little while, usually no more than six or seven at a time, before they flew away. Of course, while inside, they bit. The pain was sharp and awful, he said. It reminded him of that deep, pinching itch of the horse flies on the beach near where he grew up. And he couldnt stop them from doing anything. He just ground his teeth.

As the sun went down, the flies started to lose interest and flew away. He knew a few stayed nestled inside because he felt them moving against the thick hair of his armpit, but the majority had gone. Now just mosquitos remained to torment him with their endless bites and bottomless gullets. Somehow, he slept.

From the moment the sun came up, new insects visited him. Of all the massive, tropical bugs hed seen in Vietnam, he was grateful to have so far avoided the giant centipedes hed heard about. Massive, angry things as long as a mans forearm and as thick as a bottle of beer. One of his more sadistic squadmates hid one in the bunk of another poor bastard. It bit his feet and toes ten times before he could even jerk himself out of the bed. Grandpa hated even the tiny ones that he sometimes found in his basement back home, so the thought of those big ones made his blood run cold. [This is what they look like.](http://i.imgur.com/8Xu2NDY.jpg) God help you.

Five minutes after he opened his eyes to the morning light, one of them crawled onto his hand and wrapped itself around his wrist. He was too horrified to move. The little movement he had in his hand and wrist might have been enough to fling it away, but he didnt want to take a chance. So, he waited. Apparently the thing liked grandpa, because it remained on him for well over an hour before grandpa couldnt take the stress anymore. He tried to grab the bug in his fist. The moment he started moving, the thing began to bite. Grandpa was able to get a good grip on it and squeezed as hard as he could. 

The centipede broke in half in his hand and sent disgusting juices down his arm. The two pieces of its body dropped into the hole. The front part still had some life in it, and as it died, it bit grandpa on the nose and lips until he was forced to take its head in his teeth and kill it. He described the taste to us, but Im just not going to write it out. Yeah, it was that awful.

The rest of that day was spent suffering as flies swarmed around the carcass of the centipede. They couldnt get enough of it. For long hours he watched them eat and shit and fuck all over the monstrous bug. The juice on his arm, too, which had dribbled all the way down into his armpit, was also like the nectar of the Gods for the flies. More and more of them flew in and out of his armpit. He could tell more were staying within its moist confines, too; the pinching and itching and tickling sensations were occasionally more torturous than the nastily-swollen centipede bites.

Ants, too, noticed of the centipede corpse. This time, the little black ones werent the only variant. The red monsters with the hideous jaws had arrived. Grandpa lucked out, though. They were more interested in killing the smaller ants than bothering him. He did say one of them bit the corner of his left eye, but the pain was much less than what the pussies at camp were always bitching about. It was here my cousin told him that he missed his calling as a Gender Studies professor, to which grandpa simply replied by slapping him on the side of the head and saying, I dont appreciate jokes about that field of study. What a complex man.

Anyway, back in hell, it had started to rain. This was a mixed blessing for grandpa. The majority of bugs scurried away to find higher ground, but he was fairly certain the hole was going to fill with water and hed drown. Well, it didnt and he didnt. He even got a chance to drink some rainwater; hed been without any real food or water for well over 24 hours at that point, so he was grateful to swallow the few tablespoons-worth he managed to get.

There was a scary moment when the dirt below his hips shifted downward and he thought he was going to fall and get buried. Again, he lucked out. The shift was minor. Hed been pinned in that strange, elongated U shape for a while and having a tiny bit of the pressure relieved around his groin was definitely a plus. He was able to wiggle his hips and butt a little and figured there was maybe an inch or two of clearance in that area, but nothing that allowed him to get any hope of crawling out. 

He drifted to sleep at dusk and was woken up before dawn by severe pain in his armpit. Hed known all along that flies were busy damaging his skin and probably eating it. He was resigned to that fact. As long as it wasnt another centipede, he wasnt going to complain. But this pain was new and it was exquisite. The bites came much more frequently and he felt a lot of them moving around. That pain, despite its severity, was dwarfed by what came next. Let me just make this known: I dont want to tell this part of the story. Just thinking about it makes me cringe. But god damn it, its essential to his experience. And Im sorry in advance for you having to read it. Ill try to make it quick.

The shifting downward of the dirt was the result of an ant colony collapsing. A big one. All the ants came up out of the wreckage and had been hanging out on the surface of the dirt right below grandpas hips. But as he started to settle in to the new position overnight, the ants became agitated and swarmed him. And by him, I mean his crotch. Maybe the only thing that equalled the level of horror at the table as he talked about ants crawling into his penis and rectum was how hard my grandmother laughed as he told it. Youve gotta get really close to see the scars!, she exclaimed, as tears of laughter ran down her cheeks. My brother Dereks new girlfriend turned green and left the table with Derek hurrying after her. Grandma and grandpa shared a kiss and he continued with the story.

With ants up his dick and asshole and flies building a housing project in his armpit, grandpa suffered through the next two days in a haze of pain and fear. The lack of food and water had taken a toll on him. This, he told us, was somewhat helpful. The pain grew less acute as his consciousness waxed and waned. A tarantula wandered into the hole and grandpa was able to bite its abdomen in half and suck out what was inside. This, of course, attracted more flies but there was nothing he could do about it. If he didnt get some food and water in him, hed die. His survival instinct was still intact despite the all the trauma.

A couple more days went by and he blurrily realized hed been stuck for about a week. The rainfalls and insect pulp had kept him hydrated just enough to stay alive. His armpit was numb all the way down to the last rib on his right side. Flies were ignoring everything else and just going straight in and out of the pit. The adventurous ants had lost interest after a while, but every so often he felt a nasty pinch on one incredibly sensitive area or another. More time passed.

Late one afternoon, he heard gunfire. Hed heard quite a bit while he was stuck, but it was always off in the distance and too far for him to get any hope that hed be rescued. This time, though, it was very close. He was overwhelmed with a sense of hope which was tainted by the concern that hed be found by the wrong side. But, to his astonishment, it wasnt the VC who he heard shouting after all the gunfire. Grandpa starting waving his arm with the tiny bit of movement he could muster. He heard someone yell, Hey theres an arm over here! Grandpa yelled back incoherently and was soon greeted by the sight of a US soldier peering down at him.

It took him and his squadmates ten minutes to dig grandpa out of the hole. He remembers all of them saying some variant of holy fucking shit after theyd freed him. Someone radioed their position and after some unknown amount of time, a helicopter landed in a nearby clearing. Grandpa was loaded onto a stretcher and they lifted off. A medic who was along for the ride cut off grandpas shirt and promptly threw up. When the rest of the soldiers in the chopper looked at what the medic had seen, a few of them also rained puke down from the side of the aircraft.

A few days after being rescued, grandpa woke up in a hospital. Not one on the base, either - one in the US. He had no idea how he got there; once he was rescued, he passed out and slept for almost 36 straight hours. Some people thought he was in a coma until some poor medic tried to wake him up and grandpa said fuck off and knocked the guy out with a single shot to the chin. 

Now awake, the doctors told grandpa the extent of his injuries. Aside from the severe dehydration, he was absolutely riddled with infected bites. The ones on his more sensitive areas werent much cause for alarm, despite their unpleasantness. It was the bigger bites that were much more of a concern. The one from the red ant was the worst and for a while the doctors worried hed lose the eye. His lips and nose had terrible swelling from the infected centipede bites. Even though all those bites were awful, he couldve recovered in a few weeks and would have been back in the tunnels soon after. But his armpit was why he was sent home.

Botflies are a type of insect which lay their eggs inside flesh. [Heres a picture of them in some poor bastard](http://i.imgur.com/ZgCF1Bo.jpg), and again, Im sorry to do this to you. Until grandpas experience, no one knew they even had them in Vietnam. But apparently they do; the underside of his right arm all the way down to nearly his hip was completely reshaped into horrible cavities for their larvae. The doctors wouldnt operate, saying the only way to excise them was to let them gestate, and at a certain point, suffocate them with adhesive tape so theyd crawl to the surface. It took another few weeks, but thats what happened. Grandpa regaled us with the story of how he personally gave birth to 313 botfly larvae. Then he lifted up his shirt to show us the pockmarked skin. 

No one said much after that. He was done with the story and after shoveling a slice of fruit cake into his mouth, he and grandma left. They laughed all the way to the door. I dont really know what else to say. So yeah. Thats grandpa. Happy New Year.

<TEXT> I used to be really into Crossfit. Its a weightlifting/gymnastics/cardio program thats ridiculously popular right now and I used it in my late 20s to get into the best shape of my life. Aside from the exercise, one of the things Crossfit trainers strongly endorse is healthy eating. Lots of natural foods like quality meats, tons of vegetables, nuts, etc. Nothing processed, nothing shitty. Since I was head-over-heels in love with everything that was Crossfit, I took the dietary advice seriously.

After a particularly grueling workout, I came home to find pretty much nothing in the fridge and a nearly-bare pantry. I was absolutely ravenous and my energy levels were nonexistent after all the exercise. Luckily, there was a bag of walnuts tucked away in the back of the pantry. I remembered using them a few months earlier in some weird pork tenderloin and broccoli concoction.

I shoveled handful after handful of the walnuts into my mouth, mildly irritated by how stale theyd gotten. Thats a problem I have: I never do a good job of properly sealing foods like chips and nuts and I always end up having to throw stuff out. Anyway, I was able to get rid of the worst of my cravings with the walnuts, so I stopped eating and grabbed a rubber band to reseal them.

I happened to glimpse inside the bag before I closed it. Hundreds of tiny moth larvae wriggled around in the remains of the walnuts. Ill leave the rest to your imagination.

Check your food before eating it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the whole day, he stood in the same spot, sometimes with his paws up on the concrete, barking wildly and scratching the rough surface with his nails. I tried to get him to calm down. I had to use his favorite treats to coax him out of the basement. Once I did, I locked him outside. I put my ear to the wall hed been obsessing over. I heard a few faint scratches but I wasnt particularly bothered. Im not a superstitious man; you wont catch me worrying about poltergeists or ghosts. If anything, I was concerned about bugs getting into the foundation. I made a mental note to buy some insecticide at Home Depot.

The following morning, I looked out the window and saw the dog had started to dig a hole up against the side of the house. It was right above the spot hed been so focused on in the basement. Now I was starting to get pissed off; he was ruining Martins marigolds. I ran outside to yell at the animal. In my rush to the door, I stumbled over one of our sons' toys and went flying headfirst into the island countertop in the kitchen. I mustve knocked myself out because when I woke up, it was after dark. Outside, I heard shrill barking. Memory gradually refilled my empty head and I figured the dog mustve completely destroyed the garden by that point.

I grabbed a flashlight and went into the yard. I hadnt been wrong. The garden was a tattered mess of soil and petals and loose bulbs. The god damn dog was down at least three feet. His paws bled and were leaving red streaks against the concrete outer wall of the basement. I picked him up by the collar and lifted him out of the hole. He dove right back in. I didnt know what the hell to do. None of the stores that sold pesticides were open at this hour. And the dog was going nuts. Bob and Angelas bedroom light went on and Bob leaned out to ask if everything was okay, and if it was, to please shut the dog up. I told him I was sorry and brought the animal back in the house. 

I cleaned up his paws and talked to him, trying to get him to settle down. He seemed exhausted, and to my great thanks, he turned over on his side and went to sleep. I trudged down to the basement and put my ear to the wall again. I heard the same, soft scratching sounds. I swore. In a fit of frustrated rage, I grabbed the sledgehammer from my workbench and smashed a hole in the concrete. A large chunk fell onto the floor. I half expected thousands of flies or termites to swarm out at me. Instead, Martins glazed eyes blinked stupidly at the light pouring into the hole. His forehead was scraped down to the skull, obviously the source of the scratching sounds. When I bound his and the kids hands and gagged them, I didnt expect any noise. After one more blow with the sledgehammer and an hour to reseal the wall, I made my way upstairs. Its been three days since and the dog hasnt barked or pawed at that spot again. Im really glad I didnt have to deal with bugs.

I walked away from the tree and toward Emma and Joy as melodic formants whirled around in my head. A serene smile still streaked Joys glowing face. Emmas smile however, was gone. In its place was a look of deep concern and, despite her obvious attempt to hide it, fear. She told me we had to go in the house right away. Something awful was about to happen.

We sat in front of the television all night. Nothing was abnormal. I was getting a little anxious; Emmas vague, portentous statement was alone enough to cause concern, but flashes of lightning which hinted at a coming storm only added to the ominousness. Leaving my spot on the couch, I walked tentatively to the large windows facing the woods. More lightning; long, thunderless flashes which caused the trees to cast ghostly, distorted shadows. I was reminded of the times I saw the writhing atrocities in the lightning bolts back in Florida. The lightning here was different, though. I never saw any individual bolts. And the illumination lasted much longer.

I fell asleep in front of the TV with Emma and Joy. When I woke up the next morning, Emma was still there on the couch with us. She insisted that we stay in the living room, glued to the television, until she could know the source of the terrible feeling of dread shed felt since yesterday afternoon. The day went by and nothing happened. Same with the next. Until early evening.

Whatever boring thing had been on TV was replaced by an NBC news brief about explosion in the USSR and radiation being detected in Sweden. Emma nodded gravely and told me this was what shed been worrying about. When I asked how she knew, she didnt answer. All she told me was we were far away and had nothing to worry about, even if the news says anything otherwise.

In the morning, it was on every channel and in every newspaper. A power plant called Chernobyl had exploded and spread radioactive material over an enormous area. No expert was willing claim that Europe would be safe. Not many even said there wasnt a chance the wind could take it across the Atlantic over to us. But Emma remained calm and confident and insisted wed be safe. For the first time in months, I saw a slim tendril of bleeding muscle squirm out of the left corner of the room, only to retreat seconds later. Joy giggled in my ear, and I took her from my shoulder and held her in front of my face. She was staring at the same corner. 

The day dragged on and Emma remained fixated on the television, I asked her if shed mind if I went for a quick walk. No further than the weird tree, I told her. She said it was fine. I grabbed my jacket and left.

Spring had melted the snowpack but had yet to take the chill from the air. I stuffed my hands in my pockets and walked in a straight line toward the tree. Deep mud clung to my ankles as I trudged across the clearing. I remembered Emma telling me how the Native Americans thought the area was an important spot. I stopped in the center of the clearing and looked around. There wasnt anything noteworthy. It might have been a hundred feet across with thick groups of white birch and oak trees surrounding it. Fifty or so feet inside the treeline stood the remains of an old stone wall which Emma claimed the local tribe had built hundreds of years ago.

Icy wind whipped through the clearing and the surrounding treetops swayed. I looked at the graying sky. Flurries were in the forecast for later in the evening, but I wouldnt have been surprised if they started to fall right then. I made my way across the clearing to the tree. It stood as it did the last time; a black, bulbous object studded with countless, spiny branches and sticks. I placed myself in front of the spot where I saw the eyes. No eyes could be seen. Not even slits where they might open. I ran my hands over the scarred bark. It felt smooth, despite the blemishes. Warm, too. 

As I inspected the surface of the tree, a staggeringly-powerful taste of salt entered my mouth. It was awful. I craved water or juice or anything to get rid of the terrible, desiccating sensation. I turned around, ready to walk back toward the house, when the branches reached toward me. Before I could jump, I was grabbed and pulled, face first, against the surface of the tree. Screaming and struggling, I tried to free myself from its grasp. The taste in my mouth grew even stronger and I began to choke. The pressure grew and I could feel my cheekbone and ribs straining against the force.

Everything went black. But I didnt lose consciousness. I was free to move, but it was like I was floating in space. I spun and kicked and tried to run, only to remain in the same, empty spot. The pressure was gone. The cold wind was gone. The vile, salty taste was gone. Aside from my fear, all I felt was warmth. A moment later, I heard the voice of my friend.

Her voice came through the empty space like wind chimes on a calm day. This time, I could understand each word.

*I miss you. I miss you and I hate myself for failing you.*

Even in the maternal warmth of the space I occupied, the words chilled me and forced gooseflesh to rise on my skin.

*There is so little I can do for you now. So little help I can provide.*

I tried to ask her what she was talking about, but I couldnt open my mouth. The feeling wasnt uncomfortable - just strange. It was like I had no mouth at all. All I could do was listen.

*You need to see what lies ahead. And only after you see will you be ready to learn.*

An immense, incomprehensibly vast field of stars exploded into view. The light was intense; brighter than anything I knew could exist. Looking down, I noticed I couldnt see my own body. The nurturing warmth of the area I occupied kept me calm, though, and I gazed out across the millions upon millions of stars. Nothing happened. I bathed in an acorporeal womb of lights.

After uncountable moments, things changed. Starting at the edges of where I could see and gradually moving inward, stars went black. Slowly, and with growing speed, each pinprick of fire was smothered. With every snuffed light, the temperature dropped. Astonishingly potent fear gripped me as more and more and more beautiful lights were cut from the sky. Cold set in. It was a type of cold for which I have no words other than those which describe death. Not familiar, human death. Cosmic death. 

The icy, starless void disappeared and I found myself on the forest floor staring up at the clouds. The black womans musical voice filled my mind.

*Everything you do from now on must be for Joy. Keep her safe and show her love. It is up to you to give her a purpose.*

I gagged as the hideous taste of salt overpowered my mouth.

Dad died before the ambulance got there. The EMTs didnt come right out and say it in front of me, but I caught on pretty quickly when one of them checked his pulse, shook his head at the other EMT, and then immediately went to work on mom. All three of us were rushed to the hospital.

Moms condition was critical. Something about her being pregnant made the situation much more dangerous. None of the doctors would say exactly what happened. All they could tell me was that my parents had lost a lot of blood. When I asked how, they just said they were working on making mom better. Dr. Jessica, who I hoped would be there to help calm me down, was absent.

There was a significant commotion in the room where mom was being worked on. Doctors and nurses were crowded around her. It took a few moments, but then I realized what was happening: they were taking the baby out of her. This terrified me; I didnt know much about pregnancy, but I knew it was almost three months too soon for mom to be giving birth. Something had to be wrong.

Im not going to dwell on this next part. When it comes to most of the emotional trauma Ive encountered, Im okay with giving a lot of details. But the final moments of my moms life were too terrible; too raw. I dont want to make myself remember all the particulars. Basically, mom knew she only had moments to live. Shed lost an unbelievable amount of blood from what the doctors would only refer to as bites around her groin and upper thighs. Like dad, her femoral artery had been damaged. His was entirely severed, which was why he died so quickly, but moms wasnt as bad. Still, the ER doctors couldnt fix the wound. On top of it all, shed undergone a Cesarean section to save the baby. Her system couldnt take all the trauma.

Before she died, she was able to see her baby. I was brought into the room, too, presumably to say goodbye. Mom was gray. And most of the gray was covered with blood. Her blue lips formed the words, I love you. Her whispered speech was so quiet I still dont know if I heard her or just filled in the gap with what I remember of her voice. But after that, I distinctly remember her telling me, take care of your baby sister, Joy.

Thats all Ill say about those last moments.

I suffered an emotional breakdown soon after. Again, I was held in the psychiatric wing of the hospital. I never saw Dr. Jessica. I had sessions with another doctor, Dr. Fallon. He was kind and capable, but he wasnt the person with whom Id formed such a powerful connection months before. Along with Dr. Fallon, I spent time with Emma. Emma was my aunt; moms sister. She lived in New Hampshire and travelled to Florida the day after my parents had died. I guess mom had something in her purse detailing what should be done in the event of anything happening to her and dad.

Emma made the funeral arrangements and did all the other work behind the scenes to deal with their affairs. I didnt attend the funeral. I was barely conscious. As days and weeks went on, though, I began to come around. I grieved. I screamed and threw tantrums and hit Dr. Fallon. But, slowly, the pain lessened. My sister, Joy, was doing exceptionally well. Despite her premature birth, she was the picture of health. She was strong and vocal and, as weird as it sounds, mature.

A little over a month after the death of my parents, Joy and I were released into the custody of Emma. Emma was eight years older than mom and lived alone. She was a very successful accountant. In fact, I believe she was the only one in the modest New Hampshire town in which she lived. During our time in the hospital, Emma had taken great care of Joy and me. Id grown to like her very much. Before that point, Id only seen her a handful of times over the course of my life. But Id enjoyed her company those times. Learning that Joy and I would be moving to New Hampshire to live with her gave me a surprisingly strong sense of hope.

We arrived at our new home in early March. Id noticed I hadnt had a single hallucination or vision since the day of my parents death. While I knew it was only a matter of time before they came back, I hoped the new environment would make them easier to endure. Plus, I loved Joy. She was the most beautiful baby Id ever seen. I think she loved me, too. Shed always hold my finger in her tiny hand and smile at me, locking her enormous, blue eyes on my own. I never forgot how moms last words were to take care of her. Joys protection and betterment became my purpose in life.

Emma decided I should be homeschooled. While I thought it was odd, I didnt have anything against the idea. Id been nervous about starting in a new school with kids and teachers who didnt know I was being medicated for schizophrenia. Besides, Emma was a fun teacher. Since she worked from home, she was always around to give me little lessons over the course of the day. She didnt want to make the experience like a regular school. Instead of having a long block of classes, she just integrated subjects into conversations wed have. She loved to talk. That part got on my nerves a little bit. Sometimes I just wanted to be left alone, but Emma was always working to get me to discuss things with her. I figured Id get used to her after a while.

And I did. Before I knew it, April had arrived to release the frosty fingers of the New Hampshire winter from around our throats. Deep snow gave way to mud and tiny shoots of plant growth. Emma and I, along with a bundled-up Joy, started to take long walks through the thickly wooded area behind the house. Emma, of course, used these walks to teach me about the various subjects she believed were important to my education. I held Joy as we walked through a muddy clearing surrounded by white birch trees. Emma talked about the Native American tribes who lived there before they were driven from their land by European settlers. The clearing where we stood, she claimed, used to be a very important spot.

She extended her right arm and pointed out into the distance, behind the birch trees, and had me look at the long, low stone walls which formed a broken ring around where we stood. Then she took Joy from me. She asked that I go over, just beyond the wall, to a thick tree stump that stood darkly against the forestscape, and tell her what I thought of it when I came back. I obeyed.

As I walked closer to the stump, it became clear it was from a bizarre tree that didnt grow anywhere around where we used to live in Florida. It was very thick, maybe six feet wide, and just a little taller. Hundreds of thin branches extended from the black trunk like grasping, skeletal arms. When I stood directly in front of the thing, I examined its surface. It was darker than any wood Id seen. Almost like it was painted. Knots and blemishes covered its bark. In the cool, early spring breeze, the limbs trembled as if they were shivering.

When Id gotten a good look and was ready to head back to Emma and Joy, a powerful gust of wind blew me directly at the tree. I stumbled and grabbed the stickly limbs to get regain my balance. A couple broke off in my hands, but I was able to steady myself. I stared at the black bark of the tree. I felt wetness on my hands and glanced over. Dark red sap oozed from the breaks in the wood. I wiped my hands on the front of my jacket and looked up. Tens of pitch black eyes opened in the center of the tree and met my gaze. The musical, wordless voice of my lost friend, the black woman, filled my mind. I backed away with uncomprehending surprise. From around the tree, far away, I could see Emma and Joy watching me. Both were smiling.

<TEXT> It is with deep reluctance and gnawing dread that I choose to recall the events of last Thursday. All fibres of my being scream that doing so is a bad idea; that I should take the safe, healthy route and allow time to erase the memories. But, still, the responsible citizen in me believes an informed populace should take precedence over the real risk to my own mental health. The world must know what happened. If a watchful, beneficent God exists in a realm unknown to mankind, I hope my sacrifice may someday be rewarded. 

I had been working in So Paulo for three weeks. I was asked by my company to make the trip to Brazil to help get our new divisional office up and running. I enjoyed Brazil, despite my near-nonexistent ability to speak Portuguese. Still, I liked the few people Id gotten to know in the office, and I looked forward to attending my boss Christmas party my at her home in Chacara Flora. 

I arrived fashionably late to find the party at its jubilant peak. Our host, Bethe Silva, had made sure each of her employees was well fed and filled with festive drinks. After about twenty minutes, the electricity cut out. Thanks to the luminosity of numerous lanterns and candles around the living room, the atmosphere became even more festive. Soft shadows danced across the guests smiling faces and no one seemed to mind. I checked my cell phone out of sheer habit and noticed it wasnt working. I tried to reset it, but still it didnt work. I downed another drink and got over my mild irritation.

A murmur passed through the party as more guests realized none of their electronic devices worked. We were confused; there was no reason why a power failure would prevent our phones and cameras from functioning. Then, with a noise that sent startled gasps through the hosts large living room where we were all gathered, every door and window slammed shut. People closest to them tried in vain to get them to budge. Bethes husband, a firefighter, said something about this being a tremendous fire hazard. He banged the corner of his chair against the window to break the pane. The window held as if it were iron. He swore in Portuguese. Without warning, stifled screams filled the room. I turned around.

Six guests in the center of the room rose nearly two feet from the carpet and floated in midair. All six yelled in surprise and fear. Arms and legs thrashed with maddening uselessness as their panicked movements did nothing but assail their helpless neighbors. In a terrible, blinding flash, their clothing and hair burned away, leaving hideous, angry swaths of singed flesh on the now-hysterical victims.

I cannot overemphasize the horror of the moments which followed. Nothing in my five decades of experience on this planet can compare to the atrocities of that night. Ive been to war. Ive seen lives of men, women, and children laid waste by the actions of fellow men. But in the throes of the colossal evil I was forced to witness, I must admit I yearned for the days of simple man contra man violence. It is an admission which fills me with guilt, but I cannot be honest with myself by claiming otherwise. Whatever it was I saw -- whatever it was I survived -- made the hideousness of war seem like paradisiacal bliss.

A floating man, Alfonso Cordona, began to choke. Ryan OConnell, an internist at a local hospital and friend of Bethe, rushed over, presumably to help. The moment Ryans hands touched the choking man, another ungodly flash of light seared our retinas. The choking sounds of Alfonso were replaced by the shrill, castrato shrieks of Ryan. As our eyes readjusted to the dimness of the room, we saw the doctors arms had been charred beyond belief. Carbonized bones jutted from his shoulders like ghostly tree branches after a forest fire. The doctor collapsed to his knees, sighed a heavy, thick breath, and fell on his face.

OConnells disfigurement had distracted us from poor, choking Alfonso. He had stopped flailing and was looking in my general direction. Not at me, but through me. Through the walls and beyond the world behind them. A thick tongue bulged out of his small, red mouth. More and more of the organ pushed itself from its home. In astonished, uncomprehending terror, I watched as Alfonsos body contorted. His chest collapsed inward and his backside pulled upward into his lower back. And then it happened. Vile, connected bundles of what I knew had to be his lungs, stomach, bowels, and every other essential part of the man spewed from his mouth. They, too, floated. The husk of Alfonso thudded to the floor. 

Four of the other gravity-deprived partygoers experienced the same, torturous end; their combined viscera twisting through the air like serpentine stormclouds. Blood and other, nauseating fluids rained down upon the carpet as the other partygoers and I huddled, sobbing, against the farthest wall.

The sole surviving member of the six floating people was a woman Id met only that night. Shed earlier introduced herself as Hope. Id noticed after the initial flash which burned away her hair and clothing that she was pregnant. Unlike the damned others, Hope neither thrashed nor screamed. She levitated with serene grace, gazing out over the rest of the room with a calm demeanor which contrasted obscenely against the violence surrounding her. Extinguish the stars, she whispered. Even through the omnipresent sobs of the other partygoers, I heard each word perfectly.

Hopes jaw unhinged. The writhing tempest of loathsome, dripping offal changed directions and moved toward her gaping mouth. Tears filled my eyes as the ropes of organs disappeared down her throat. Hopes body began to change. She swelled from the mass of that which was being driven into her. A moment later, she flushed bright red. From our vantage point, perhaps twenty feet away, we felt blazing heat emanating from her flesh. Steam gouted from the vermillion landscape of her skin, billowing in noxious clouds which dispersed throughout the room. Her belly seethed and distended as I realized, with a chill which momentarily overtook the scalding humidity of Hopes hellish actions, that she was metabolizing the human meat in order to nourish the child inside her.

The repulsive process continued for another few minutes. The room was wet and stifling and even through the choking steam, Hope shone through like a hateful sun. Every passing second caused her belly to grow and soon she was drastically larger than any pregnant woman Id ever seen. The last of the meat disappeared into Hope. The temperature of the room dropped. In the tiny space of relief the remaining guests and I enjoyed, Hopes child erupted from her body. 

A baby unlike any Id ever seen crashed onto the floor in a shower of afterbirth and gore from Hopes devastated pelvic caldera. A vaguely anthropomorphic shape rose on thick, strong legs. Its body was covered in thin, ossified plates. The plates quivered and extended outward, revealing their true nature: quills. Hopes now-dead body fell from the air and impaled itself on the quills. No one in the room was surprised when the infant-creature began to consume its mother. Even the most fragile members of our surviving group had stopped crying. I believed they had either accepted their places in this impossible, heinous situation, or had disassociated entirely. 

It was only when the creature had stripped the flesh and muscle from its mother and consumed everything but bones did it look upward. Large, bright red eyes focused on us. In the blink of my own tear-filled eye, it launched itself with unimaginable speed and power at our group. The unlucky three directly in its path were cut to ribbons by the blades covering its body. The other two, Bethe and her husband were quickly grabbed and exsanguinated before they could even attempt to run. I, somehow, managed to escape to the other side of the room and hid under a large couch. Why I bothered to move away, I didnt even know. Id long assumed that my death was only inevitable; some sense of innate self-preservation must have overridden my trauma-induced nihilism. 

It was that move which saved my life. Once the creature had consumed the corpses, it burst through the wall and left the home. I waited for six hours before I dared slide out of my hiding place. I ran to the neighbors home in my gore-caked holiday outfit and barged in without saying a word to the furious and frightened homeowners. Only when they realized I was calling the authorities did they soften and realized Id experienced a terrifying ordeal. In broken Portuguese, I did my best to communicate to the emergency operator that they needed to go to the home where the violence occurred. After I hung up, I curled up on the floor and wept.

The police arrived, and, after inspecting the home Id escaped, took me in for questioning. They held me for days as they worked to determine whether or not I was a mass murderer and cannibal. Finally, yesterday, I was released. Now I am back in my apartment. I have not slept since December 23rd. 

Whatever I saw that night is out there. It, and whatever empowered it, is real. It is beyond anything I can hope to comprehend; beyond anything I can ever want to comprehend. As of today, there is no mention of any of it in the Brazilian newspapers. By writing this letter, Ive been forced to relive the worst moments of my life. I am certain my already-damaged psyche has endured another crippling blow as a result. Still, my concern about my own madness is second only to my desire to not see another person succumb to the bestial wrath of whatever that thing is. Even if it means I never sleep again.

<TITLE> Christmas Morning With Danny and His New Puppy </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-27 17:04:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We waited until 6am to call Danny downstairs. I couldnt believe was actually sleeping; hed been talking about Christmas for the last two months. We heard him tossing and turning from the other side of the wall until something like 3am. But Dana said hed eventually tire himself out, and, of course, she was right. Within five seconds of his mom and I yelling up the stairs for him to come down and see what Santa brought him, Danny was sprinting toward the living room. When he got there and saw what was under the tree, he stopped dead.

The look on our Dannys face was incredible. It was a mixture of shock, disbelief, and joy. His eyes were wide and he slapped his little hands over his mouth to stop himself from screaming. The present wed gotten for him padded over, her tail wagging, and licked Dannys elbow. Danny took his hands from his mouth, his eyes still wide, and carefully embraced the German Shepherd puppy. Dana read that the breed was great with children; that they were loyal and loving and really great for a kid to grow up with. From what we were seeing already, wed made a great choice.

The puppy regarded Danny with shy tenderness. She stopped licking his arm and elbow and started to gently paw at his knee. Danny, to our delight, took the puppys paw in his hand and shook it. Then he let go. The puppy presented her paw again, and Danny, in turn, shook it. Dana and I looked adoringly at one another. The puppy was already starting to learn tricks.

I asked Danny what he wanted to name the puppy. Danny looked thoughtful for a moment, but then he lost interest in my question and continued playing with the little dog. Now the puppy was lying on her back. Danny rubbed her tummy and put his forehead on her chest. The puppy leaned over the sniffed Dannys head over and over. Danny found this wildly funny and laughed hysterically while he sniffed the puppy in return.

While Dana and I unwrapped the presents wed gotten for each other and watched Danny play with his new best friend, we heard a something sliding down the steps from upstairs. The slide became a tumble, stopping with an ugly thump at the bottom. Dana mumbled something about Danny leaving a toy on the steps and walked over to pick it up. When she got there, I heard her scream. I shot off the couch and ran over to my wife. Danny was lying on his back, covered in blood. Bite marks covered his head and face and throat. His legs were twisted in horrific, obscene angles suggesting countless breaks. Dana panicked when she touched his neck, saying something crazy about him not having a pulse as she pulled her phone from her pocket to dial 911.

My blood ran cold as a powerful shiver flashed down my spine. Leaving Dana to call the ambulance, I walked the interminable ten feet down the hall to the living room. I peered around the corner. The puppys back legs spasmed with pitiful kicks as the Danny-shaped creature beside the Christmas tree pulled the dogs body down its loathsome, gaping throat. I retched and doubled over, gasping in disgusted, uncomprehending horror. Its eyes studied me for a moment; the dogs legs now dangling with flaccid lifelessness. Its impossibly powerful jaws snapped shut, dropping the lower half of the animal onto the red and gold tree skirt. Bloody tangles of viscera blanketed the books and videogame our son hadnt gotten to unwrap. The Danny-creature walked over to the sliding glass door, opened it, and, as the siren of the approaching ambulance grew louder, ran away into the woods.

The next week passed with shocking normalcy. My parents and Dr. Jessica noticed a gradual decline in my outward projection of stress, and they all believed the medication had started working much earlier than theyd expected. Session after session with the doctor yielded the fruit which shed hoped for; I didnt seem terrified, I didnt speak of invisible monsters, and my smile had returned. The diagnosis of childhood schizophrenia, while terrible in its implication, seemed, to all observers, to serve as the catalyst for a series of treatments which allowed me to resume my normal life.

I didnt mention the pain my father seemed to be in as he walked.

I didnt mention the cracked, raw skin around Dr. Jessicas mouth that was impossible for her makeup to adequately hide.

True to my word, I ignored all the abnormalities that I believed were real but couldnt talk about. And the worst, apparently, was still ahead of me. As the black woman portended, an increase in the severity of my visions and the real-life effects of the creatures actions on those who couldnt see them would all come to a calamitous head. But I waited and waited. And it didnt happen. In fact, it was the opposite. 

More time passed. Dr. Jessicas mouth healed and my father seemed no worse for wear. Even the visions that Id done my very best to ignore were beginning to fade. They occurred less frequently, and, even when they did present themselves, the potency was little more than a faded nuisance; an afterimage of bright, passing headlights during a nighttime drive. I was released from the hospital in early July. I began my summer like a normal, 7 year old boy. I played with my friends, all of whom were happy to see me. While my parents still felt concern about my wellbeing and were reluctant to let me out of their sight, even their mild paranoia diminished as the heat of summer cooled into a tolerable autumn. 

I entered the second grade in September. After a couple weeks, I didnt see a single, full-on hallucination. Every so often, I would see vague shimmering in cracks and corners or behind the clouds. I didnt even pay attention. It had gotten to the point where I was convinced the medication really was helping me; that my parents and Dr. Jessica were right about my sickness all along. 

I excelled in school. To me, my past troubles served only to give me a greater perspective on life and made me want to try as hard as I could to do well. Autumn begat winter. The Christmas season was a beautiful, loving experience. And when I thought it couldnt get any better, my parents told me I was going to be an older brother. I was bewildered by the height of my joy at the news; I felt like I could really be a positive role model in his or her life. 1986 arrived with me feeling as good as I could remember. While I infrequently thought about the black woman in fleeting moments of strange nostalgia, I remembered that my real life had so many things going for me. Such positivity. Such potential.

On the 28th of January, I was sitting in class when a school aide came into the room and whispered something into Mrs. Carlsons ear. My teachers expression became one of shocked sadness. Collecting herself with practiced, professional rapidity, she thanked the aide and faced her class. She announced to us that something had happened during the launch of one of the space shuttles.

The class looked frightened and upset. Our school was in Florida, about 50 miles south of Cape Canaveral. Students would sometimes go on field trips to watch launches with their science class; the space program was of deep personal interest to many kids and their teachers. Mrs. Carlson wheeled the television set from the corner of the room, pulled up its antennae, and switched it on. The class was greeted by the sight of a single, thick column of billowing rocket exhaust which had terminated in a large puff before forking out into two, thinner tongues of smoke which curled around in a serpentine arcs before disintegrating into small, burning chunks of debris which tumbled from the sky.

No one said anything. The poor television signal had barely enough potency for distorted audio, but we could all understand what was being said. The space shuttle, Challenger, exploded a little more than a minute after launch. The crew was not expected to have survived. As the class took in the horror of the disaster, I stared, wide-eyed, at the grainy picture. As the explosion replayed over and over, I watched as obscene, writhing tubes of impossibly thick, bloody muscle waved through the air like colossal earthworms. Theyd pushed up through the ground and the water - hundreds of them - slashing through the smoke as if celebrating the shuttles destruction.

Far above, in the gloriously blue sky of that Florida winter day, holes of black space had opened as far as I could see. With all the strength I could muster, I tore my gaze from the screen and looked out the window. The sky above the school was also riddled with holes. Faint stars twinkled within the black maws, and a haze of red strings hung down like the tentacles of a cosmic jellyfish. I rested my head in my hands, pushing my palms with painful force against my eyes.
The familiar lightshow of amorphous, organic shapes danced in my field of vision. I breathed with slow, controlled breaths, working with great effort to calm down. To regain control of myself. When I took my hands from my eyes and the blurriness gave way to sharp clarity, the holes were gone. The tentacular strings were gone. I looked at the television with its endless loop of destruction and the tubes of muscle were gone. 

The bell rang. We were being dismissed early. Our principal made the call on a rumor that the space shuttle was carrying something toxic and he worried it could be carried by the wind to our area. The busses were already there and waiting for us. I got on and began the short ride from school. I arrived home and walked up the short front walkway. I opened the door and went toward the den where the television was blaring. My parents didnt answer my yelled greeting when I came in the house. I yelled louder and walked into the den. They were both slumped down on the couch. Thick, crimson stains of what had to be blood covered the front of their jeans and had spread down to their knees. I couldnt tell if they were breathing or not. 

Wet coils of meat grew from the floor and slapped soundlessly against the gray carpet. I called 911 and just stood there, watching it all. I prayed for the black woman to show herself. But she remained absent. The coils grew longer and gathered around mom. They brushed her groin and belly with repulsive, seductive familiarity. At that moment, I knew shed be allowed to survive whatever had befallen her. Instead of relief, I felt naked horror. I pressed my palms into my eyes. When I uncovered them a minute later, my view was no different. I wouldnt let myself cry.

Mom and dad looked on as I swallowed a small, beige pill with a gulp of orange juice. I wasnt to expect any effects of the drug to be noticed for a week or two. Hearing that disappointed me a little. I was hoping to have all this end right away, as soon as the pill disappeared down my throat. 

We watched 101 Dalmations on the little TV and ate some freezer-burned ice cream. Afterward, mom kissed me goodbye and told me dad would stay the night. She needed to go to work early the next morning. When she left, dad took a quick shower, donned his flannel bathrobe, and sat down in the chair next to my bed. We started to watch The Happiest Millionaire. He was snoring within ten minutes. An hour later, I was asleep.

Late at night, I was startled awake by an odd, whimpering sound. I opened my eyes and looked out over the right side of my bed. My friend stood there like an obsidian pillar, her gaze directed not at me, but in the direction of where my father was sleeping. Her bituminous flesh was being touched by a faint, dark red light. The sound persisted. I turned around, dragging my heavy, exhausted face over the pillow, and saw my dad, still sitting in his chair, breathing heavily. 

As my eyes gradually acclimated to the dim light, I was able to see in greater detail. Dad was sweating. I could see it pouring down his forehead, over his closed eyes, and down to his lips and neck. Dads bathrobe began to shift. He hadnt stirred or moved anything aside from the heaving motion of his chest as he breathed. Fine, red lines dropped from somewhere above him and his robe opened fully. I snapped my head upward.

Before a scream had completed its leap from my throat into the world, the black womans hand was covering my mouth. I pulled and jerked, trying to get away to call for help, but she was impossibly strong. *Let it happen,* she spoke directly into my mind, *and he wont be killed.* Utterly helpless, I was forced to stare in near silence; the only sounds being my snorting, panicked breaths and my fathers whimpering. 

Above dad, extruding filaments of gossamer which pulsed with crimson bioluminescence, was a hole. Id never seen anything like it. It was a six foot sphere of blackness taking the place of the air and ceiling above him. And from that sphere grew glowing strings. 

The strings extended outward and down, traveling over dads face, chest, and stomach, until they reached his groin. In abject horror, I stared as they began to slide, one by one, into his penis. The glow of the tendrils underwent a brief process of intensification as they pushed deeper into him. I nearly lost consciousness when I saw his scrotum bulge as the tendrils moved inside, their glow illuminating the veins in his skin. Time passed with glacial speed as hundreds of the things with the combined diameter of a pencil invaded my father. Sickening undulations below his skin waxed and waned. The only consolation was that he didnt seem to be in pain; he sweated and breathed in heavy, sobbing heaves, but I was hoping, in his mind, it was nothing more than a nightmare.

I couldnt watch what they were doing to him any longer and my friend was still holding me tightly, preventing me from moving or screaming. My eyes drifted toward the void from which the filaments came. Now fully acclimated to the dark room, I could see that the hole wasnt completely black. I was shocked to see that there were stars shining within. Last summer, Dad and I spent many nights out in the backyard with the beautiful, expensive telescope hed won in a contest at work. As an astronomy buff, he was excited to point out all the constellations and planets. He was so proud of me for remembering every single one of them. But the weak glow of the stars shining within the void were parts of no constellations Id ever seen. There didnt appear to be any discernable order to the pinpricks of light at all, aside from a few obvious binary and ternary systems. 

Not knowing if it would work, I furiously thought, Im not going to scream or touch anything, I just want to look. The black womans grasp loosened. Her right hand remained wrapped around my wrist, not entirely trusting me, but willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. I stood on my bed and walked around, looking into the gulf of stars. From a vantage point at the foot of my bed, I saw what might have been a planet, but not one Id ever seen in books or on that Carl Sagan show dad liked to watch with me.

Whatever it was, it terrified me. At one point in its history, it might have been a normal sphere. But some colossal force had cleaved it into multiple, chaotic chunks that remained clustered together by its hideously powerful gravity well. The surface was blanketed by what I could only describe as frozen, rotting flesh. It had grown like pustulent rime, first within the cracks and interstices between the largest chunks of rock, and then over the main, cratered surfaces. In the craters, volcanoes ejaculated jets of putrid-looking yellow gas which quickly coalesced and froze  into pebbles which rained on the ground below.

With blinding violence, my arm was yanked downward and I collapsed onto the bed. My body was held and my mouth, again, was covered. Pain radiated through my shoulder like Id been stabbed. As I yelled under the black hand, I felt her other one grab my shoulder and push forward and up. I felt a pop and the pain quickly diminished. A dull ache replaced the sensation, but my attention shifted to my father. The things were leaving him. One by one, they extricated themselves from his anatomy and slithered their way back into the void from which they came.

Once the last one had disappeared, the void collapsed in on itself, leaving a tiny singularity of bright light before blinking out. The dark room was normal again and my friend let me go. Dad awoke with a gasp and twisted his head back and forth, as if looking for the assailants he believed had visited him in his nightmare. He saw me staring at him and forced a calming smile. He looked down and noticed his robe had been open. Whoops, he said, covering up. Sorry you had to wake up to that! He got up and walked over to the bathroom. As he relieved himself, he made pained, grunting sounds. He flushed, washed his hands, and came over to me.

Remind me to ask your mom to pick up some cranberry juice tomorrow, he told me. He kissed my forehead and sat back down. We turned on the TV and watched some old cowboy and indian movie from when he was a kid. He went back to sleep with little effort. I locked my glare on the stygian eyes of my friend. You have to tell me whats going to happen, I thought at her.

*I will, but only in pieces small enough for you to digest,* she replied. *And starting now, you have to ignore everything that only you can see.*

Including you? My question felt hollow and pained. I couldnt stand to act like my friend, my protector, wasnt actually there. But I knew she had to have a point. If I wanted to get better, at least in the eyes of those who were trying to help me, I couldnt keep talking about crazy, impossible creatures. 

*Including me,* came the answer, *for another nine months.*

While I tried to figure out what could happen in that period of time, she interrupted my thought process.

*As I told you, things will get worse. Events beyond any comprehensible level of evil will take place. And even as they do, you have to stay silent.*

And with that, she was gone. It was only then did my scream peal throughout the room, rousing my father and causing a nurse to rush in. When they begged me to tell them what was wrong, all I could do was apologize.

Despite the black womans dire warning, I slept through the night for the first time in nearly a week. Knowing she was watching over me imbued a sense of safety and comfort; something, to the deep chagrin of my parents, no one else had been able to provide since this whole ordeal started. The sleep was dreamless and restful. My only moment of discomfort was the space between waking up and opening my eyes; I felt certain my day would begin with the sight of my friends mangled body. 

Thankfully, my worry was misplaced. She stood over my bed, cast like a scarred shadow against the harsh white of the hospital wall. Her darkly beatific gaze followed my smallest movements. Always alert. I smiled and noticed how itchy my face was. The scratches from my fingernails were healing quickly, but the sensation of their mending was unpleasant. I pressed my fingertips against the scrapes. It helped a little. 

After about five minutes, my parents came in the room and apologized for not being there when I woke up. They wanted to bring me some breakfast thatd be better than what the hospital offered. I was given a box that smelled phenomenal. I opened it and was greeted by pancakes and sausages and potatoes from the same diner dad and I visited the day before. I devoured it all while mom discussed what my day would be like. It turned out Id be with Dr. Jessica for a few hours. She asked if Id be comfortable with that. I told her it was fine. I was curious to learn what was wrong with me. Mom did her best to explain nothing was *wrong* with me; just a little different. And soon that wouldnt even be case, either. Things would go back to how they always were. I liked hearing that.

Once mom was done talking to me, dad and I took a shower. He hadnt taken one with me in a couple years; he said he just wanted to make sure Id be okay in there. I didnt mind. It felt nice to have him wash my hair again. To my surprise, the black woman didnt stay at the foot of my bed. She followed us into the shower and stood right in front of me. Dad spent most of his time passing in and out of her, totally oblivious to the third person in the stall. All the while, she watched every movement of my body with rapt intensity. Part of me realized she needed to stay by my side in case something bad happened. After what she told me last night, I was happy for her to be there; not only for my protection, but for dads, too.

I noticed, for the first time, I was close enough and in a room sufficiently bright to see between the black womans legs. Last year, mom sat down with me and we went through a book showing pictures of men and women while she explained what made us physically different. What my friend had looked a little like the pictures in the book and what Id seen of mom, but behind the hair were ghastly scars. These were different from the others all over her body. With these, it almost looked like something had bitten huge chunks of the flesh away. I shuddered and wished I could hug her.

We got out of the shower, toweled off, and got dressed. My friend, who was never dressed, stood stoically as mom brushed my hair into a shape that would be somewhat presentable. A little while later, the four of us were walking down the hall and took the elevator up to see Dr. Jessica. I was excited. 

My parents greeted Dr. Jessica, hugged me, and left. I sat in her sunny office on the biggest beanbag chair Id ever seen. My friend stood directly behind me. Dr. Jessica sat very close, maybe just a couple feet away, on her own beanbag. She handed me a grape lollipop that had a tootsie roll inside. My eyes widened. So far, everything was going great.

The doctor asked me how I was doing. How I felt. I answered honestly: Id been feeling pretty good since I woke up. Then she wanted to know if Id seen anything since I got to the hospital yesterday afternoon. When I told Dr. Jessica that the black woman was alive, she seemed very interested. She told me to describe her as best I could. So I did. Much taller than dad -- so tall her thick, frizzy hair brushes against the ceiling. Naked all the time, too. And so, so dark. Almost impossible to see unless the light was on. And now shes covered in cuts and scars and bites.

The doctor wanted to know about my friends injuries: how they happened, where they were, what they looked like. I was very clear with my descriptions since I was able to turn around and look at every bit of damage on her body. Dr. Jessica appeared very concerned when I described the scarred bitemarks disfiguring my friends vulva. I was asked what might have caused the bites and why shed been bitten there. Since Id already talked about the writhing tubes of muscle that had bored through her body to cause the other scars, Id mentioned those things didnt have any teeth. So I said I didnt know. But they were definitely bites. I got closer to my friend and stared. Lines created by what had to have been rows of tiny, terrifyingly-sharp teeth ringed each barely-healed gouge. 

In my head, my friend spoke. *When you turn around, please dont be scared - it isnt strong enough yet.* With galvanizing force which nearly knocked me off the beanbag chair, I whirled back to face Dr. Jessica. As the doctor asked if I was all right, I stared at the area by the door. I did my absolute best to remain calm and informed Dr. Jessica that no, I didnt think I was okay. 

On walls and ceiling behind the doctor, was...something. It wasnt a person or an animal or a plant or even those bleeding, fleshless serpents. Until that moment, I never thought Id prefer seeing a writhing mass of those awful, murderous coils. But this time I did. My mind filled with the voice of the black woman telling me we were safe. Its all that kept me from screaming.

My voice shook as I told Dr. Jessica about the monster. It reminded me of the scab that grew on my kneecap when I took a nasty spill while dad was teaching me how to ride a two-wheeler. In the hours and days after the fall, the cut dried in patches of red and yellow and white. It itched. Yellowish lymphatic fluid dribbled out the side of the dried parts when I scratched too hard. The atrocity by the door looked like that scab, only without the dry encrustations. This thing was wet. And thick. The cheery sunlight pouring through the large windows cast its rays on the thing, causing it to glisten and reflect sickening, amorphous patches of pink light onto the white walls around it. It moved, well, oozed, outward in all directions. I was vaguely reminded of the underside of my tongue; slick, veiny, and muscular. 

I glanced back at Dr. Jessica as I described what I saw. She was writing furiously in her yellow notebook. Only when I gasped did she look up. Pulsating slits of swollen flesh split open over the entire surface of the creature. From the slits came thin tubes that reminded me of skinny versions of the serpentine coils from the other days, but these had round, bulbous tips on their front end. They looked like the eye stalks snails have, only veiny and muscular and dribbling blood and other, unnamable fluids. They extended further and further from the main body, slithering around the room and twisting through the air. 

One slid through the back of Dr. Jessicas head and exited via her mouth. I told her what was happening. She asked me something, her voice unobstructed by the ghostly flesh impaling her skull. I didnt answer. While she spoke, the thick head of flesh capping the end of the tendril opened to reveal countless rows of tiny, impossibly sharp spikes. More and more of them gathered around me, all opening to threaten with their translucent, yellow teeth. I started to cry as I realized Id wet my pants. The toothed bulbs leapt toward me and I fell backward over the beanbag chair in terror. I landed on my back between the feet of the black woman. She stared downward with her confident glare. Its gone, she informed me. 

Dr. Jessica was on her feet helping me up within seconds of my fall. My friend was right: the thing had disappeared. The doctor hugged me, then put her hands on my shoulders, looked into my eyes, and said shed page my parents to bring me back to my room. She told me it was okay to end early on the first session. She was proud of the great work I did. I concentrated on her mouth as it formed her words. A ring of angry, chapped skin had developed around her lips. It wasnt there when our session started. I pictured the fat-headed tendril pushing through her mouth. Shed been hurt.

The speed of my breathing increased and I pointed out the injury. She looked puzzled as she traced the cracked, dessicated flesh with the tip of her finger and winced when the left corner split and produced a droplet of blood. The look of confusion only lasted a moment. She tried to reassure me by saying itd been like that all day. All the talking mustve worn away her makeup or shed rubbed it away with her hand. But I didnt believe her. And she seemed shaken. She tousled my hair and hid my stained pants with an apron used by other kids who painted during their own therapy sessions. 

My parents came moments after theyd been told I was done, and after they spoke to the doctor, the four of us walked back to my hospital room. I kept thinking about Dr. Jessicas mouth. On our way, I saw tubes of wriggling muscle dangling from the ceiling. Again, the black woman let me know it was okay. She strode with authority down the hallway, never leaving my side. As we passed the writhing creatures, they decayed into smoldering ashes. I smiled. Dad noticed. He asked if I felt better. I told him I did. Mom let me know Id be starting some type of medicine with my dinner later in the day. My smile broadened. Between my friend and the medicine, things were going to go back to normal. Still, what I was told the night before chilled me. *This will get much, much worse for you soon.* 

The grin slipped from my face as the density of the creatures increased and the black woman wasnt burning them all. Maybe she couldnt. But maybe she didnt need to. I forced myself to believe things were moving in a positive direction. As we walked by a reception area riddled with intestinal endpoints gouting thick, bloody foam into pustulent craters on the floor, my friend reached down and held my hand. I was overcome with surprise and joy. I could finally touch her. Her palm was warm and muscular. Safe. My dad saw my hand reaching upward and he took it in his own. I was beaming. Dad smiled to himself with contentment. Hed been waiting for days to feel like he could comfort me.

<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3wezdz/i_was_diagnosed_with_childhood_schizophrenia/)

The nights leading to my first encounter with Dr. Jessica were spent sleeping in my parents room. I couldn't stay in my own. Whenever I went back, I was greeted by the sight of the black womans ruined body. It looked like the creatures had taken away the parts they needed, but what they left was hideous: tendons and gristle and fat stuck deep inside the recesses of her skeleton. The one time I ran in to grab a shirt for school, I saw one of the things curled up inside her splintered rib cage. When it noticed me, it uncoiled itself and rose like a cobra until it reached my height; a tube of glistening muscle as thick as my thigh standing at attention as I rushed to get the shirt. I stifled a sob when I saw how much bigger it was than the others Id encountered. 


The death of my friend, or my episode, as my parents called it, was on a Saturday. I was allowed to stay home from school on Monday, but Tuesday and Wednesday were business as usual. I was happy for this; I loved school. My teachers enjoyed me, I had a couple friends, and I always got good grades. I was scheduled to meet with the school psychologist on Friday, and I was looking forward to whatever help he might be able to provide. On Thursday morning, though, something happened.

Dad and I had just finished breakfast at the diner and he was bringing me to school. I was looking out the window, still half asleep. It was a cloudy spring morning. The weather people on the radio had predicted thunderstorms, and, for once, their forecast was accurate. A bolt of lightning lit up the sky. As I traced the jagged path, I noticed something weird. The edges of the bolt looked fuzzy, almost like the lightning was covered in windblown fur. The bolt was too far away for me to see anything clearly, so I just chalked it up to being overtired. Id barely slept since Friday night.

In class, about halfway through a day like any other, the storm that had been threatening us the whole morning finally came. Now, this was southern Florida, so were used to thunder and lightning. But this one was abnormally strong for the time of year. Even in the summer, it wouldve been one the jaded locals wouldve commented on. Torrential rain started, followed by small hail. Then came the lightning. It was very, very close. In his calm voice, Mr. Davis asked the students sitting in the row nearest the windows to sit in seats closer to the middle of the room.

I was sitting on the other side of the classroom when lightning struck a tree across the soccer field. The explosion of thunder was instantaneous and a couple kids gasped. Even Mr. Davis jumped a little. But those reactions were only on the periphery of my attention. At the forefront was the bolt of lightning. When it struck the tree, I saw the furry edges again, but with much greater clarity. From this distance, I could make out individual hairs of the fur. Not fur, I realized, but those vile creatures. Countless, seething tendrils of raw muscle writhing around the edges of the bluish-white plasma. As the bolt faded, so did the things. Every flash which followed had the same edges. I felt panic rising in my chest and I excused myself to the restroom.

I sat in the stall and worked to control my breathing. The fragility of my mindstate had me on the verge of crying. I rested my head in my hands and tried to stifle my emotions. The collisions of heavy raindrops on the metal roof of the school seemed to mock my attempt, so I let it happen. Hot tears drooled from my brown eyes and puddled silently on the bleached tile floor. I pressed my hands into my eyes and concentrated on the fireworks display of meaningless, organic shapes. When my breathing slowed and the tears stopped flowing, I opened my eyes and stood up. I left the stall, turned the corner, and went to the mirror. I stopped breathing.

Everything that would normally be reflected was there, except it was blanketed in gore. Not just blood, but hair and veins and patches of skin. Stretching through the room like perverse pneumatic tubes were thick ropes of intestine. Bulging things traveled inside them and disappeared into the walls and floor where the ropes were anchored. 

I whirled around and was greeted by the usual, untainted view. Another kid, Luis, was just coming in. He greeted me with a smile, but upon seeing my pale, tear-streaked face, he furrowed his brow in concern and asked if I was okay. I turned back around and looked in the mirror. Luis was standing in the same spot, but he was grotesquely deformed. One eye socket was stretched into an abyssal caldera from which the creatures poured their endless lengths onto a floor carpeted in patches of cracked, eczematous skin. Both arms were whittled down to gleaming white bone and his viscera was tied into the intestinal transitway that stretched the room. I passed out.

Apparently when I was unconscious, part of me was awake -- and all that part did was yell. I screamed about snakes made of meat and theyre coming out of the lightning and someone help Luis. When I woke up, I was in the hospital. Both my parents were next to me. Both, it appeared, had been crying. My face hurt and I tried to raise my hands to my cheeks but my arms were strapped down. Legs, too. I struggled but mom came over and put her soft hand on my forehead. 

Its just to make sure youre safe, she whispered, you scratched your face up pretty badly when you were asleep. I wrinkled my cheeks and winced when I felt the swollen skin bunch up near the scrapes. I didnt say anything. After a little while, a woman who called herself Dr. Jessica came in and sat down next to the bed. She asked me a few, basic questions. My name, my age, my favorite food; I figured she wanted to get to know me. Then she asked if I would be comfortable if my parents left so we could have some privacy. I looked at them and they nodded to say it was okay, so I agreed. They went out in the hall.

Dr. Jessica wanted to know what happened today and on Saturday. I told her everything. She had a warm, supportive look on her face as I gave all the details. I worried that shed laugh and call me crazy, but she never did. She even told me how sorry she was that the black woman had passed away. I liked Dr. Jessica. I asked what was wrong with me, and I was told, Sometimes kids see things that other people dont. It doesnt mean theyre bad or broken or anything like that, it just means they might need some medicine to help them from seeing more scary things.

I nodded, then I asked if I could have that medicine. She said maybe, but shed have to talk to my parents about it first. After a few more questions, she pressed a button near the bed and told the nurse it was okay to undo the straps on my arms and legs. Once that was done, Dr. Jessica told me Id have to stay in the hospital for a couple days, but shed see me the next morning. Then she gave me a hug and left to talk to my parents outside.

As I cautiously touched the scratches on my face and neck, I watched my parents and Dr. Jessica talking through the glass. Mom wiped her eyes a few times, but they both looked like they appreciated what the doctor was doing. Dad peeked his head through the door, asked me if I was okay, and then said he and mom and the doctor had to go down the hall to fill out some paperwork. If I needed them, he told me to push the red button next to the bed. I said okay.

The room was quiet. A small, wall-mounted television displayed a baseball game without any sound. I sighed and wondered if I was crazy. Id never heard of these things happening to anyone else. None of my friends were ever in the hospital except for Pat when he broke his leg. But that was different. Im different. I rubbed my eyes, being careful not to reopen any of the scratches on my face. The familiar fireworks display behind my eyelids greeted me as I modulated the pressure. When I stopped and I opened my eyes, the room was blurry. I blinked to get everything back into focus. 

Standing at foot of my bed, towering over all the furniture in the room, was the black woman. I gasped with surprise and felt a rush of delight until I saw her disfigurements. Heavy, keloid scars rose like scraps of gray leather across the totality of her flesh. Her left breast was gone; in its place was a crater of gnarled tissue. Thin, strong forearms were crossed over her belly, but behind them were unhealed gashes. This woman, my friend, despite being alive through some miracle, was in pain. Agony. Still, hidden within the benthic depths of her eyes was the protective warmth and powerful confidence Id grown to cherish. She turned her head to look outside. It was raining again. Lightning streaked by, its edges squirming with coils of hellish flesh. The sound of her voice filled my mind. 

My parents entered the room and sat in nearby chairs. Mom was closest to me while dad was by the bottom of the bed. Of course, they didnt see the woman. She remained at her post, watching everything. They spoke to me about the medication Id be starting tomorrow and the scheduled therapy sessions with Dr. Jessica, and although I heard them talking to me off in the distance, it wasnt what I focused on. Because now, for the first time, I could understand exactly what the black woman spoke into my head. No more syllables and formants carrying vague, emotional cues. This was a statement. A warning.

*This will get much, much worse for you soon -- and Im so very sorry.*

I started to weep and my parents did their best to comfort me. I didnt say anything to them. What was there to say? They wouldnt believe a word of it. Mom stroked my hair and dad put his right hand on moms shoulder and reached over to hold my ankle with his left. The whisper of gentle rainfall filled the room, occasionally interrupted by my desperate whimpering. A single, massive tear slid from the glistening corner of the black womans right eye and landed on my fathers index finger. Dad glanced at the ceiling with confused annoyance and wiped his hand on the blanket.

<TEXT> I was six when the lady appeared in my room for the first time. She stood next to my bed and watched me. When I saw her, I was understandably surprised. Shocked, even. But, for whatever reason, I wasnt scared. I found something about her to be deeply comforting. She was black, but not like Mr. Davis, my teacher at the time, or like moms friends Darryl and Shevaun. She was black like I never had seen before; light seemed to disappear into her flawless skin. 

We gazed at one another for a minute or two, then I trotted over to my parents room and announced, theres a naked lady in my bedroom. Mom snorted out a poorly-stifled laugh and dad told me to come over, gave me a high-five, and instructed me to go back to bed. I obeyed. Before I pulled the covers up, I reached out to poke the womans knee. My finger slipped through as if she weren't there. I slept as she stared down at me.

In the morning light, I could see her somewhat better, even though she still seemed to embody night itself. She was tremendously tall; nearly brushing the ceiling with her lush hair. And her eyes, as black as the obsidian face in which they sat, had no sclerae, no irises, and no discernable pupils. Twin voids. Her teeth, too, were equally dark, and it wasnt until the light caught the sheen of saliva coating them that I knew she had any teeth at all. 

Days went by and my parents entered and exited my room for various reasons without ever seeing her. If they needed something over where she stood, they simply passed right through as if she were a hologram. I often mentioned her to them, only to get predictable responses. They told me they were happy I had an imaginary friend. Dad revealed he had one when he was my age, too. Not a naked lady, though, he added, winking at me. Mom rolled her eyes and tried not to laugh. I didnt know why they thought it was funny.

Beginning the night she appeared, the black woman would talk to me. Id never see her mouth move and I dont think I actually heard her truly say anything, but I still knew she was communicating with me. Whenever Id have a hard time sleeping, shed even sing. I didnt know what the words were, or even if they were words at all. But within minutes, Id be dreaming. In my dreams, Id hear her whispering. Syllables and formants; nothing I could understand, let alone repeat. Still, the sounds made me feel stronger. More attuned to the world around me. And throughout, all I felt was warmth and serenity. I knew she loved me.

Two nights after my seventh birthday, my parents were out with Darryl and Shevaun. Our neighbor, Laura, was babysitting. At one point, Laura dragged the telephone out onto the porch to make a call, leaving me in the living room to watch TV. I didnt mind. I liked Laura and she was a great babysitter. She always ordered us Chinese food. 

She was on the phone for a long time. I got up to get another bowl of fried rice, but as I was walking down the hall, wriggling tubes of what looked like raw, bloody muscle spontaneously sprouted from the hardwood floor. I stopped in my tracks. They pushed upward until they were nearly a foot tall. After a few seconds, they all pointed toward me. Terrified, I did my best to jump over them but I landed right inside the thicket of meaty tendrils. They tried to grasp my legs, but instead moved through my limbs like ghosts. Now in a frenzy, they whipped and slashed through the air, slapping against the floor and spraying crimson blood all over the walls and ceiling. 

I screamed. Laura heard me and sprinted to my location. She grabbed me and checked for injuries. Then she held me as I sobbed. While I was in her arms, I watched more fleshy tentacles burst from the floor around us. Laura was oblivious to what I saw, and she begged me to tell her what was wrong. This time, they left me alone. Instead, they moved to Laura, wrapping around the space she occupied until all I saw was a Laura-shaped, gore-drenched monstrosity that embraced me and promised that everything was okay. The room spun and I vomited all over myself, her, and the floor. The things disappeared.

Laura washed me and the floor and then changed into one of moms shirts. She called the restaurant where my parents said they could be reached in an emergency. While I waited on the couch for them to come home, I saw serpentine undulations right below the surfaces of the walls, ceiling, and floor. When my parents returned, Laura told them what happened. After paying her and apologizing for all the puke, they wanted to hear my side of the story. I told them. 

As expected, they didnt believe a word of it. Still, they recognized the fact Id been traumatized. They believed that *I* believed what happened. As I calmed down and my more acute memories of the writhing atrocities began to fade, they asked me if Id be okay with sharing what I saw with a doctor who might be able to help. I agreed quickly; I wanted nothing more than to never see those things again.

They carried me to my bed and, at my insistence, left the light on. The black woman was there, watching me, as I curled into a ball under my blankets. I drifted to sleep with the sounds of her reassurances and soft, incomprehensible singing.

I awoke near dawn to the sight of her devastated body. She was riddled with gaping holes the same width as the creatures Id seen the night before. Her belly had been torn open, exposing pink and yellow viscera which contrasted obscenely against her dark flesh. The eyes which once watched over me had been forced from her skull. I howled with ferocious desperation. The howl turned into a scream which turned into uncontrollable crying. My parents ran toward the sounds of my agony and swept me in their arms, frantically trying to find out what was wrong. I couldnt speak. As the sky brightened and parents tried to comfort a mourning son, I watched through my tears as the creatures silently grew out of the floor and began to pick more flesh from the corpse.

<TEXT> The Future Queen erupted from Her mother and left behind a devastated pelvic caldera. Perfect teeth gnawed through the umbilicus, severing Her connection to the worthless container. Throughout the world, cancers began inexorable metastases in testicles and breasts and bones. Perceiving all; feeling all; The Future Queen stood and gazed at the assembled mass of venerators.

Nourish me, She instructed; Her neonate voice still commanding and seductive.

The venerators of The Future Queen chewed flesh from their bodies. In the watchful rapacity of Her ravenous glare, hundreds of mouths worked thousands of teeth. Walking forward, the venerators drooled the pulp of nourishment down Her throat. She grew. Within minutes of Her birth, She began to excoriate, flay, and consume the venerators without assistance. Their bodies disappeared into Her own while Her metabolism radiated heat and Her sweat evaporated in billows of scalding steam.

The last living venerator wept with awe; the only form of obeisance of which the wreckage of his body was capable. He peered upward at the form of The Future Queen; an infant in an adolescent body. The steam pouring from Her caused his flesh to bubble and slough from its bones. His last image of this world was The Future Queen squatting to devour that which he had grown for Her. 

Nourished and left to machinate, The Future Queen devised strategies to ensure her ascension. Hers were strategies of disintegration. Strategies contra structure; contra organization; contra form. Strategies which unfold at the collapse of empirical epistemology. At the end, in the creeping cold of total entropy, The Future Queen antithesized creation. The death of all stars would begin Her reign. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wed been snooping around on Russian networks after Alexei learned about an unpatched firmware exploit in some older Cisco boxes. It turns out quite a few science labs over there still use that equipment. Lots of what we saw was boring. I dont read a word of Russian, and Im deaf so I cant understand it spoken, either, but Alexei signed that it was all climate change data, petrochemical exploration, and something about water desalination. We were discouraged; wed hoped to find something related to aliens and nuclear weapons. 

Right before we were about to call it a night, Alexei noticed one of the labs wed been traversing had an IP camera broadcasting to other addresses on the network. We couldnt believe how insecure these internal networks were. I clicked over to the camera and was delighted when a clear picture came up. There was even an icon in the corner telling me it was broadcasting sound. Alex indicated that hed sign any audio that came through.

Onscreen, a naked man sat on a wooden chair in a brightly-lit room. He was reading a book.

He flinched in momentary surprise when a deep voice came from the speaker in the camera. I felt it the volume of it in my chest from the subwoofer of Alexeis computer. Alex signed what was said: Go ahead, Pavel. Yaroslav, please stay seated. 

The screen flickered for a second, then nothing happened for a full five minutes. We thought something might have gone wrong with the video, but we saw Yaroslav flipping the pages of his book as he read. Then tiny trickles of blood began to ooze from his ears. Before he could react, his face burst. Three foot stalactites of jagged bone exploded outward from the front of his skull. He didnt move for a moment. One eye dangled from its tattered optic nerve while the other, still intact, blinked over and over. His mouth was nothing more than shredded meat and pulped gums. A trifurcated tongue writhed and slapped against the spikes of bone like rudimentary tentacles. Finally dropping his book, he stood up on unsteady legs, his hands reaching to touch the obscene growths. He pushed on them, gently at first, then harder. His head moved with the force. 

That voice again. Alexei shook as he signed for me: Keep running the 270 and introduce a 272 harmonic. Then raise the amplitude of the 272 until I tell you to stop.

More spikes bloomed - this time from Yaroslavs feet, shins, and calves. The flesh disintegrated and what remained below his knees were roughly spherical dandelion heads of jagged, ossified quills. He stumbled and fell face first, the bones jutting from his face arresting his fall, momentarily catching him. He teetered, then went down. 

You can turn it off, Pavel.

The screen flickered again. A man wearing heavy-duty ear protection entered the frame and walked toward the writhing form of Yaroslav.

Then our connection to the network died. 

Alexei and I stared at the terminal which had replaced the video stream. We stared for a while. What was that?, I signed. My throat felt lined with sandpaper and my stomach lurched with dread. Alex shook his head. A line of red about as thick as a human hair slipped out of his left ear. His eyes widened and his face disappeared as jagged, gray blades erupted from the front and back of his head. He collapsed on the ground. 

I panicked and ran home. That same night, maybe an hour or two later, his apartment building exploded from what was officially called a gas leak. The newspaper said 17 people died from the blast and subsequent fire. Alexei was listed among the dead. Now its been three days and I dont know what to do. I cant go to the police because I cant dispute the official story and potentially implicate myself. Plus, someone is making a concerted effort to lie about the cause of his death. They were willing to murder 16 innocent people to cover it up. What will they do to me? Im too afraid to leave my apartment and I know posting this is going to get their attention, but Im terrified and helpless. I need to know what to do. I need to escape but I have no money to go anywhere. Help me. Please.

<TEXT> I didnt understand. I had those floaty things. My teacher said everyone did. An artifact of our eyes developing, or something like that. I guess hed been told the same thing, but it did him little good. His parents were concerned, of course, and they brought him to ophthalmologists who were all in agreement: his eyes were fine. When he denied the experts claims and doubled down on his insistence that something was wrong, his worried parents got him into therapy.

I guess the therapist helped him a little bit. Malcolms paranoia seemed to diminish somewhat and his anxious habits like twitching and blinking werent as pronounced. That was good - a lot of kids made fun of the way he blinked. He told me it helped push the things out of sight for a couple seconds.

From what I can remember, Malcolm started seeing the therapist when he was 7 or 8. I thought things were going pretty well until he turned 14. I dont know if it was the combination of his underlying problems combined with the hormonal onslaught of puberty, but his anxiety and paranoia returned with a vengeance. He started getting into fights at school whenever someone made fun of him. His mom confided in me, since I was his best friend, that she saw cuts and scratches on his upper arms when she accidentally walked in on him getting changed. She was at her wits end with worry and implored me to do whatever I could to help him feel better.

Over time, I worked to evolve my role in his life from friend to confidant. It was easier than I thought. He was used to telling me about his problems. Apparently, aside from his parents and the doctors, I was the only one who knew about his fear of the floaty things. When I asked him about those, he started to cry. He was worried he was schizophrenic; his therapist mentioned the possibility and it terrified him. Those things were always, *always* present in his field of vision. And while they were there, they talked to him. Goaded him into self-destructive behavior. All he could do to stop himself from going crazy was to obey them and make the little cuts on his arms and legs.

He showed me the cuts. They werent deep, but there were a lot of them. Especially on his inner thighs. Being 14 myself and not understanding why someone, anyone, would cut themselves, I tried to get him to explain why he couldnt just stop. All he said was, Im giving them what they ask for so theyll stop biting. Before I was able to question what the hell he meant, he kissed me. 

I wasnt prepared that. Id never been kissed before. I didnt think I was gay, but I wasnt particularly interested in girls, either. I kissed him back. And that was it. Whatever it meant to him, Ill never know for sure. I knew he was dealing with intense turmoil. More than I could handle. But hed just shown how much he trusts me. He showed me the cuts, knowing I might run away in disgust. He kissed me, knowing I might knock his teeth out. He was trying so hard to overcome whatever was consuming him, and I wasnt going to let him down. I had to be there for him.

Something like a year passed and Malcolm just got worse. He skipped a lot of school and was even hospitalized when he had some kind of breakdown in the supermarket with his mom about a week before summer vacation. Despite my desire to see him in the hospital and give whatever comfort I could provide, he turned me away. Once he was released, on the infrequent occasions he agreed to meet up with me, he looked awful. His dark brown complexion was tinged with gray. He was emaciated and his arms were covered in cuts. They were deeper now; he didnt even bother hiding them. They grew up his wrists onto his forearms and biceps and triceps like angry, scabbed ivy. I pitied him.

The day after Christmas, he asked me to visit him at home. His parents were overjoyed by the fact hed not only initiated the contact, but that he talked openly about how excited he was to give me a present. They thought he might have finally turned the corner.

I walked up the stairs to his bedroom, knocked, and was greeted by something unexpected: his smiling face. He hugged me and had me come in. He handed me an envelope and watched with excitement as I opened it. Inside was an illustration hed done in the hospital depicting the two of us holding hands. I cant thank you enough for all the support youve given me, he whispered, as tears welled up in his eyes.

I beamed at him as he smiled back, the tears now flowing freely over his sharp cheekbones. In what had to be the space of two seconds, he produced a small knife from his back pocket, and, without looking away from me, stabbed through each of his eyes. The only scream that filled the room and echoed throughout the house was my own. Malcolm sat back, the bed directly behind him, and put his head in his hands. As blood drooled from his punctured eyes and seeped into the carpet, he wept. 

His parents arrived in his bedroom seconds after my scream and gasped in horror at the damage to their son. He moved his head up and faced the direction where he assumed his parents were standing. I had to, he sobbed, over and over, tears pouring from his undamaged lacrimal glands and diluting the stream of blood flowing down his face. 

His father ran to call 911 while his mother wrapped her arms around him, not knowing if she should press something against his bleeding eyes or if that would only make it worse. The bleeding was slowing down to a trickle, though. The first few times he moved his head in my direction, I diverted my eyes, foolishly not wanting to meet his sightless gaze. But, as the moments passed and we waited for the ambulance, I studied his face. He looked calm. Soon, he started to smile; a beatific, worryless grin that was in frightening contrast to the gore only inches above it. 

Watch, he mouthed at me. As I stared, tiny lines began to appear in the blood around his eyes. The lines looked like tracks, only I couldnt see what was making them. His mom noticed what was happening and jumped back in surprise. The tracks poured from his ruined eyes and traced clean lines down his dark cheeks. I told you, he sighed. He tilted his neck downward and shook his head. When he faced forward again, no new tracks were being carved out of the blood. Malcolm ground his sneaker into the rug where hed been facing. Please hold my hand, he begged, reaching in the direction of where I stood. I did.

The ambulance arrived and rushed Malcolm to the hospital. I didnt see him again for a long time. After recovering from the surgery to remove his eyes, he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where he stayed for 18 months. His parents called me a few times early on to let me know how he was doing, and the general consensus was that he seemed a lot better. Yes, he was blind. But he didnt exhibit the paranoia anymore. He didnt try to injure himself. He slept through the nights. 

I was glad to hear the positive updates, but I was deeply shaken by what I saw that day. Not just Malcolms violence toward himself, but the aftermath: the streaked tracks across his bloody face. I never spoke about it with his mother. Even today, its something I try to convince myself was a false memory brought on by the trauma of seeing someone I cared for harmed so badly. But I know better.

It was four years before I saw Malcolm again. I visited his house, again around Christmas, because it was the break between my semesters at college. He looked great. The glass eyes he had were eerily lifelike. Hed put on some weight, but he appeared healthy and happy. His parents left us alone to talk. For a couple hours, we chatted about what wed been up to. When it was time for me to go, I pulled him in for an embrace, which he returned with enthusiasm. I wanted your face to be the last thing Id ever see, he whispered. Your smile gave me the courage I needed to make myself a better person. I stared straight ahead into the kitchen, not knowing how to respond. Those floaty things drifted through my vision, contrasting strongly against the white-painted wall. I hugged him tighter.

<TEXT> The diary was from a while ago; 21 years, according to the dates. It was sealed really well in plastic wrap and stuffed in a watertight bag. If I hadnt hit the thing with my shovel when digging a hole to take a dump, I never wouldve found it. I wish that wouldve been the case because I cant stop thinking about the stuff I read. Im only going to share the fucked up parts, but all Im leaving out is the lady talking about how she and her husband were spending the month camping and having a good time. There, I just saved you 5 pages. Heres where it got weird:

-------------------------------------------------------------

*7/2/1994, 7:00am*

Last night, James and I got woken up by a ridiculously bright flash of lightning. There was no thunder, either. James said it mustve been heat lightning. Hes probably right because it was disgustingly hot and muggy all day and once the sun went down it got even more humid. We eventually got back to sleep and this morning the air seems a little less like a wet sponge. Were hoping to do 12 miles today.

*7/2/1994, 8:00pm*

I dont even want to write this down because its so gross. James asked that I do it anyway so well remember to report what we saw once we get to a ranger station. Like I could forget something like this. Anyway, here: all day, while we walked, we saw animals. Deer, birds, raccoons, squirrels, chipmunks, and a black bear. Thats pretty par for the course out here. But when we went off the path for a little bit because, well, James was staring at my ass for the last hour while we walked and I guess he got some ideas, we were stopped by the sight of something awful about a hundred feet off the path. Well, many somethings. Strewn across a wide area that I estimated to be a couple thousand feet were miscarried animals. They were all at different stages of development. It was horrible.

*7/3/1994, 2:45am*

Im not able to sleep after the events of yesterday. James, of course, is snoring like a buzzsaw despite the big flashlight lighting the tent up. What the hell couldve caused something like that to happen? Ive heard about animals going to find a safe place to die when theyre sick or old, but Ill be damned if something like what we saw is in any way normal.

That heat lightning just happened again. This time it was three flashes clustered together within a couple seconds. No thunder. Fuck thats creepy. James is mad that I just kicked him to wake him up and tell him about it. Sorry hon.   

*7/3/1994, 7:30am*

I got to sleep about an hour after the lightning. Thank God we brought some good coffee to brew over the fire. Were going to do 10 miles, although it might be a little less because the map says were getting into a pretty hilly area. Good for the glutes!

*7/3/1994, 9:15pm*

Pretty good walk today. Were both going to be sore tomorrow, though. The map does a decent enough job telling us where the hills are going to be, but its shitty at indicating how steep they are. On the bright side, and I never thought Id be at a point in my life where this sentence would make sense, we didnt see any more fields full of animal fetuses. Whee.

*7/4/1994, 6:10am*

My dickhead husband smuggled some fireworks in his pack and decided to wake me up by setting them off right outside the tent while screaming, Happy 4th of July! Of course he was naked as he did all this and was presenting himself to me through the tent flap while holding a sparkler in each hand. Ive come to the conclusion that I love his sense of humor between 8am and midnight, and anything from 12:01am until 7:59am makes me want to choke him. Waking up to explosions and his dick and balls is not quite how I envisioned our mornings together. Take away the explosions part, though, and Im pretty okay with it.

It looks like its going to rain today. The clouds are low in the sky and its pretty breezy. Gusty, too. The rain gear we bought before we started our hike kept us dry during the storms last week, though, so Im not too bummed out about it.

*7/4/1994, 6:30pm*

No rain while we walked. James shot a rabbit an hour ago and hes about to skin it and get it ready for the fire. Hes making me learn how to do it, too. Its pretty much the last thing I want to do, but theres no reason why he should have to be stuck with the job every time we want to eat some cute forest critter. Ugh. Here we go.

*7/4/1994, 7:30pm*

I just finished throwing up. As soon James started working on the rabbit, we saw how sick it mustve been while it was alive. Again, Im only going into detail so we can report it at the ranger station, but for fucks sake James, if I have to learn how to skin a rabbit you can learn how to write clear, descriptive sentences. Thats a fight for another day. Under its fur, the rabbit was absolutely covered in what looked like big whitehead zits. They were under a lot of pressure, too, because when James poked one with the tip of the knife it burst and flung grayish white pus like 10 feet and onto the tip of my shoe. Cue me throwing up for a half hour while he apologized and tried not to laugh.
We still have a good amount of beef jerky and stuff in the food pack, so its not like were going to go hungry, but it wouldve been nice to have something a little different. The rain finally started and were stuck in the tent.

And heres the lightning again. Its flashing over and over and over. Sometimes its a few quick bursts, others its just single ones that last upwards of 4 or 5 seconds. Its those long ones that scare the shit out of me. Ive never seen lightning like that before. James keeps telling me its unusual but not unheard of, especially at this time of the year. It appears to be tapering off a little now, and Im pretty glad it coincided with rain this time. I guess it really is just plain lightning. James is a pretty reassuring guy. Early bed time.

*7/5/1994, 10:10am*

Im freaking out because James is trying hard not to freak out. Weve been up since 6 and when we opened the tent the ground outside was covered in dead birds, dead bats, and dead bugs. And I mean covered. I guess we didnt hear them hitting the ground because of the rain that started up again while we slept, but we still have no explanation as to why theyre all fucking dead. Thats not the worst part, though. Theyre ALL covered with those zit things like the rabbit. 
Were deciding to cut the trip short and get the fuck out of here. The map says theres a ranger station about 40 miles to our west, and James said we can get there by tomorrow afternoon if we really move. Both of us are at the point where really moving sounds like a great plan.

*7/6/1994, 12:30am*

We walked fast and we walked far. The whole way, we saw dead animals. They werent as tightly clustered together as they were around our tent, but we still saw a lot. I remember walking under a tree where the ground was littered with dead wasps. When I looked up, there was a huge nest with nothing flying around it. The forest is almost silent, too. No birds. Only insects. And even their sounds are few and far between. I never realized how omnipresent their din was until it was nearly gone.

Fuck. Just a minute ago, the first live deer wed seen in all day walked into the lit area around our tent. It stared at us for a while on the outskirts of where the light fell, and when it turned around, I saw a dead fawn hanging halfway out of her body. As the deer trotted away, the fawn slid out and hit the ground with a wet thump, still connected to its mother by a tangle of afterbirth that stretched until it, too, slid out a few feet later. Fuck everything. Good luck trying to sleep tonight, Mel.

Okay something just happened while we were sleeping and I am freaking the fuck out and can barely breathe and I dont know what to do other than write it down to make it make sense. The lightning came and just...stayed. The whole forest was lit up. James and I tried to convince each other it was just the weather. But it stayed lit for a whole minute. Then two. I begged James not to go outside but he unzipped the tent and went out. I panicked and didnt want to be alone so I followed him and the entire sky, not just one area where lightning might be, was white. Brighter than the sun at noon. It hurt my eyes really bad to look at and James was squinting hard, too. I squeezed my eyes shut to recover a little and when I reopened them, he was gone. I ran around and looked and didnt see him until I turned back around and he was right there again, staring at the sky. Except, he was...wrong.

He didnt answer me when I screamed his name. He didnt even blink. And I could see bumps starting to form on his neck and face. The light was so, so bright. I pushed James to try to get his attention and when I did the area under his shirt where I pushed got soaked with something. Well I know what it was but I couldnt look. I couldnt. I cant. He is still outside and hes not moving. Just standing and staring at the terribly bright sky. His pupils are gone and all thats left is the blue and white. Hes different. Hes wrong. His skin is getting worse. And I am fucking terrified.

Little bumps are popping up on my hands while I write this and theyre coming to a head and now one of them just broke open and thats my blood on the page. I know the wetness I feel on my thighs is blood, too. Blood signifying the end of what Id been waiting to tell James on our anniversary next week. I keep thinking about the dead fawn sliding out of its mother.

Im going to wrap this journal up in a bag and run in the direction of the ranger station. I dont know what else to do. Ill leave it under a tree or in some safe spot right off the trail so someone can find it if something happens to me on the way. This page is soaked through now. I have to go before I get worse. Before James gets worse. The light is so bright.

-------------------------------------------------------------

And thats what was in the diary. As soon as I read it and typed out what was inside, I mailed it to the CDC because I have no fucking idea what was wrong with that lady and her husband and I sure as hell dont want to catch anything. That last page she wrote on was disgusting. I wish Id been wearing gloves when I touched it. It was encrusted with dried stuff, probably that pus she wrote about, and it smelled awful. I washed up real good and left a note for the CDC guys to be careful with it.

Im pretty reluctant to go back in those woods again, but Im just being stupid. I bet the whole thing was a prank by some high school assholes and Im going to waste the time of some pretty important guys when they get what I mailed over. Still, Im more than a little creeped out. Everything that lady wrote about is just so far-fetched. But I still wonder. I wonder because I vaguely remember hearing about some massive animal die-off back in that part of the state in the mid 90s. It was probably something else though. It had to be.

<TEXT> I wont give a long backstory because it doesnt matter. Basically, he got the job through a former schoolmate of his who worked in some mid-level Party position. Dad was down on his luck at the time and Egor happened to see him at a local tavern. They got to talking, and Egor pulled some strings and gave him the position. Didnt matter that he wasnt qualified. Half the guys arent, he was told.

Anyway, dad started working there in 1984 and did a pretty good job. He did what he was told; most of it was just checking dial readouts and making sure pipes were sealed and whatnot. In late 1985 and early 1986, he started noticing far more Party representatives coming in and out of the plant. Usually the visits were limited to compliance officers and hazardous materials supervisors when radioactive material was moved in or out. But these werent plant specialists. They looked like they were Politburo. He told me he recognized a couple of them from televised speeches, but he didnt remember the names. He just knew they were high ranking.

On the night of the meltdown, Dad was doing his usual valve and dial checks when Politburo members, accompanied by soldiers with kalashnikovs, streamed down the hall toward the reactor area. The soldiers were wearing radiation suits. The Party members werent. He tagged along a few tens of meters away and went up on a high catwalk where he could see all of them. They crowded around the cooling pools. Dad made an effort to act as if he was staring at the pressure readouts in front of him, vaguely noticing they were rising as he watched.

This was around the point when the lights cut out. Apparently this wasnt abnormal for the plant; the electrical systems were under maintained and all the electricians on staff were tasked with more critical work. Even with the lights not working, Cherenkov radiation cast its characteristic blue glow over the group and illuminated the politicians and soldiers. The water in the pool started moving.

Now, dad wasnt a nuclear engineer. Still, he knew whatever was happening in the pool was abnormal. Hed been by the area plenty of times and never once did the water move like it did right then. It sloshed with turbidity and looked like it was coming to a rolling boil. He glanced at the dials in front of him and saw the temperature and pressure in the loop system was dramatically higher than it shouldve been. As he was beginning to sprint across the catwalk toward the nearest alarm station, he saw something that made him stop.

What he told me didnt make much sense at first. You have to figure someone running at a dead sprint to pull an emergency alarm at a nuclear power plant wouldnt stop for anything. But he stopped. And he stared. Something had floated to the top of the boiling water. The way he described it, it was dark, grayish red, almost shaped like a person, but much bigger and dreadfully deformed. It floated, facedown, in the pool. The Party members didnt react but the soldiers raised their rifles at the thing until one of the politicians barked an order at them to stand down.

A moment or two later, the thing crawled out of the pool and raised itself on thick legs to stand before the gathered crowd. What dad said he remembered most about the thing was its head. It sat directly on its lopsided shoulders and it had no eyes, no nose, no ears. All that was there was a gaping hole. Not even a mouth, but a hole. And inside, the same blue glow from the pool shone out onto the faces of the people surrounding it.

Someone else in the plant mustve noticed the temperature and pressure abnormalities and pulled the alarm, because sirens began to blare and diesel generators were galvanized into action to force the cooling cycle into overdrive. None of that mattered to dad, though. He said the thing approached the soldiers, one by one, and without any of them putting up a fight, it pressed the hole in its face against the top of each of their heads and they started to dissolve. First their suits melted, then their skin began to blister and char. The thing moved its maw downward until it nearly reached their legs, which dropped to the ground in a smoldering heap.

It then did the same to the assembled Politburo. All but one. She stood in the middle of a pile of steaming legs and hips and crotches and stared at the atrocity. Then, she screamed at it. Its something dad said hes repeated to himself every day since.    . *Salt the earth.* As the words left her mouth, the geiger counter dad was forced to carry with him at all times exploded into life at the same instant the politician burst into flames. He could swear she smiled as she burned.

All this was finally enough for dad to make a break for it. He knew hed been irradiated badly, but he took some solace in the fact the ticks from the counter slowed quickly as he left the pool area. Right before he was clear of the room, he took one last glimpse at the thing. It had begun to melt. As soon as its body began pouring through the metal grate, the water below erupted into a mass of superheated steam. Dad avoided being scalded to death by about half a second when he turned the corner and slammed the door behind him.

The rest of the meltdown played out more or less like it was eventually reported. Dad was able to get out before the main explosion. He lived with the profound guilt of running by his colleagues who still didnt know something truly catastrophic was about to happen. He believed his thyroid cancer was payback for his indifference toward them during his escape. 

The iconic photograph of the radioactive elephants foot in the basement of the power plant stood, framed, on his dresser for the rest of his life. As he told me this story, he confessed he kept it to remind him of the implications of the politician's words before she was devoured by flames. That thing will render the area around it uninhabitable for a hundred years, he sighed. And its melting through the ground, even today. If it hits groundwater, itll explode like a dirty bomb and make the disaster in 86 look like a firecracker. Russia, Europe, North Africa. All irradiated. 

He died a couple days after he shared his experience with me. I just have no idea what to do with it all. Obviously, he couldve made the whole thing up. But I dont know why he would. He doesnt have anything to gain now that hes dead. Maybe some of the other survivors or their kids can corroborate parts of what he said, maybe they cant. Either way, if its true, there is so much more going on with that disaster than weve been told. Even now, as that radioactive slag melts into the ground, dads story almost makes it sound like the meltdown was just a precursor to something far worse. Something plotted. Please, if anyone can give some advice or insight, it would be appreciated. I dont want what he told me to be true, but     terrifies me more than I can bear.

<TEXT> *Stop eating,* came the seduction, *and I will nourish you.*

As the words drooled from its lips and puddled inside her ears, Joy began to change. She became less; the decrease in her mass was matched by the strangling of her vivacity. The Joy her friends knew dissolved into something cold. Interactions with her that once provided comforting warmth now left them furred with rime. They let her go.

Autumn vitrified into winter and Joy strode with mindless, impelled teleology on the legs of a newborn foal. True to the promise of her seducer, she was nourished. Her needs were met each night, all night, as she stared at the ceiling of her bedroom. Her eyes traced the shape floating above her. Traced the undulations under its skin. Traced the extrusion of its nourishment into her throat. Traced its lips forming the words:

*Give me a child and I will make you an angel.*

Joys asceticism evolved into sexual voraciousness. Her needs were met each night, all night, as she stared at the ceiling of her bedroom. Countless men poured themselves into her as her hips began to crack under relentless pressure. After many days, Joys body, reshaped by the nourishment of her seducer for selection and rejection, made its choice.

Fertilization begat blastulation; 

blastulation begat implantation;

implantation begat gastrulation; 

gastrulation begat neurulation. 

The Future Queen bathed in the uterine warmth of Its mother.

Before It knew of Its own existence, The Future Queen knew Its purpose. Before The Future Queen knew what stars were, It dreamed their deaths: starved of hydrogen, helium fusing to consume the star shell before degenerating, and stellar cores flashing their own helium into carbon. White to red, red to black. Void. And so would begin The Future Queens reign.   

Joy was oblivious to the proto-machinations of her Child. Her only concern was to be a perfect vessel, and that is what she became. Over time, her emaciated body began to plump with gravidity. Her seducer remained above her and Joys body transformed its extrusions into nutrients for The Future Queen.

As the vessel swelled and The Future Queen writhed within, Its presence was felt. Processions of women and men crawled on bloody knees to glimpse the container in which The Future Queen was being constructed. Masses crowded around it. They studied its form; its bone structure; its flesh. Minds spun as they contemplated the moment its final functions would be actualized.

Overcome with the desire to venerate the constructor of The Future Queen, they laid hands upon it. Fingertips stroked its breasts, its mouth, its shattered hips. Faces peered between its splayed legs at the area through which The Future Queen would travel in mere months. Wide eyes stared inside before their views were obscured by tears of awe. And serpentine tongues stretched to taste a womb as fertile as the soil of Golgotha. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Under My Teeth </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-24 17:03:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Somethings living under my teeth. Whenever I chew, it screams. I had to stop eating. When I try sleep, if my mouth closes and my teeth click together, my ears are pierced with the sound of agonizing horror. Now sleeping is out. I cant afford a trip to the doctor, but I know I cant live like this.

The moment I gripped one of my bottom teeth with the pliers, the screaming started. Tears filled my eyes and blurred my vision. With all the strength I could muster, I yanked down and away from me, bending the tooth at a 90 degree angle. It came out with a crunch. The rest of the ones in front came out easily enough, but the molars were disastrous. Each time I worked to get a grip and squeezed hard enough to pull, they shattered into splinters of enamel that made me choke and cough. The screaming persisted. Without many options, I grasped the exposed roots left by the burst molars and pulled. The screaming combined with the sound of a thousand shrubs being simultaneously pulled from the ground and white pain exploded through my head. When I succeeded in yanking out the last one, a double-rooted wisdom tooth, the screaming stopped.

Everything was silent. With shaking hands, I shone a flashlight into my mouth and stared at the wreckage of my mouth in the mirror. After a moment, I saw something slide out of one gaping socket. I was filled with a terror and fascination. The creature was black and thin and slick with my blood and saliva. It kept pushing out, coiling itself on my tongue. More and more of its body escaped from the raw hole until my mouth was nearly full. Tilting my head downward, I let it spill out into the sink. It uncoiled like a garden hose onto the porcelain. Another two or so feet snaked out of my mouth until it was out of me. Then, without any ceremony, it crawled down the drain.

With no more screaming to disturb me, I slept like a baby. A couple days went by, and then my mouth started to itch. The feeling made me want to drag sandpaper over the holes until there was nothing left but jawbone. I managed to control myself. This morning, however, I awoke to an ecstasy of delight. My mouth was melting with pleasure. Every socket was being scratched exactly where it itched most, over and over. 

I flew to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Hundreds of tiny black worms swam in and out of the holes; their bodies manipulating the nerves within to communicate the greatest sense of physical relief Id ever experienced. In a mindless, hedonistic fog, I closed my mouth and squeezed my jaw to push the top sockets against the bottom ones. When the holes touched, the tiny worms could freely crawl in and out, up and down. As if in thanks, they began to sing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a car accident. A bad one. I was unharmed, but my wife died on impact. My son, Cam, made it out alive. I guess you can call it alive. He was pinned by a piece of metal through his groin. Someone at the hospital said it was a miracle he didnt bleed out. I wouldve believed them if he didnt burn while he was pinned. 

Trapped in the backseat, watching the flames come toward him, Cam's skin started to blister. He screamed and screamed. Some of it was unintelligible, but a good portion was him begging me to help. I couldnt reach him. So, I watched him burn. His skin steamed as the moisture inside boiled. His hair ignited in a white flash, burning off in seconds. The clothing was next. It was cotton, so it went quickly enough, but his sneakers smouldered and melted, coating his feet with molten artificial material.

I didnt hear the fire trucks arrive. Firefighters pushed me to the side as they doused the car and its occupants with flame retardant foam. Cam had lost consciousness, but Id just assumed he was dead. When they found a pulse and sawed open the car to get him out, I couldnt comprehend how hed survived. But I felt something like joy. I rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital. It was while he was in the burn unit having 90% of his skin debrided that a nurse told me how lucky he was.

Its three years later and Cam is 14. His body is a perverse canvas of skin grafts and amputations. His arms and legs were burned to the bone and had to be removed. While in the burn ward, a staph infection developed in his lower jaw, which also had to be amputated. His tongue and teeth were taken from him, too, and a large flap of skin was sewn from his chest to the area right below where his nose used to be. Now his neck is forever craned downward. His eyes were unscathed, though. He had the presence of mind to cover them with his hands before they could be destroyed by the fire. Must be that luck they said he had.


Now I can feel the heat of his glare whenever Im nearby. Its as if he wants to tell me something. But thats supposed to be impossible. He hasnt demonstrated the ability to communicate at all since the accident. I know differently. I think hes just biding his time. For what, though, Im too frightened to imagine. But the signs are there. Every day, I have to remove the charred carcasses of birds and squirrels from the area of the yard that Cam can see from his propped-up position in bed. I keep thinking back to how he must have felt as I watched him burn. His glare tells me he hasnt forgotten.

Someone at the hospital said it was a miracle he didnt bleed out. I wouldve believed them if he didnt burn while he was pinned. 

The fire started under the hood and moved backward. While I stood and watched, helpless, I saw Dianes hair and clothing ignite. Soon after, her skin started to steam and split, and once the moisture evaporated, she began to char. But shed been killed by the accident. This was just extra. Cam, however, was alive, and he saw the fire coming toward him.

Before he was licked by the flames, the heat had taken a toll. Even from the backseat, his skin started to blister. He screamed and screamed. Some of it was unintelligible, but a good portion of it was him begging me to help. He was completely out of my reach. So, I watched him burn. His skin, like that of his mother, steamed as the moisture inside boiled. His hair ignited in a white flash, burning off in seconds. The clothing was next.

<TITLE> Dumbwaiter </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-16 17:06:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My daughter found an old dumbwaiter in her closet. I never even knew we had one. It led down to the basement, but apparently the compartment got bricked up before we moved in. 

She was pretty disappointed when I told her I wasnt going to break down the wall and make the thing functional again. She wanted to send me little presents from her room while I was watching the game in the basement. Still, she liked hanging out in her closet and pulling the thing up and down. I figured there were worse things she could find interesting. 

One weekend, the girls were playing in their room. They were using the dumbwaiter, as always; sending one of their dolls down, making up a little story, and then rescuing it. I heard a little bump when the kids accidentally hit the bottom of the shaft with the dumbwaiter compartment. Then they pulled it back up.

The the youngest one screamed. I didnt flinch. Theyre 4 and 7. Theyre always screaming. But then her sister started in. My wife and I ran upstairs and the girls were backed up against the far side of the wall wailing and crying. I tried to ask them what was wrong but they were inconsolable. The older one pointed at the closet. I went inside and looked. Inside the dumbwaiter compartment was their pet hamster, only really, really messed up. Its eyes were expelled from its sockets and all its guts were pushed out its backside in gristly tangles of rodent offal. 

My wife tried to comfort the girls and theyd finally stopped screaming. They kept saying they never put the hamster in the elevator (thats what they called it) and he never left his cage. We didnt bother to chastise them for lying at that point - they were obviously too upset. My mind was elsewhere, though. I was trying to figure out what the hell happened to that hamster. It was inside the compartment, so it couldnt have gotten crushed underneath when it was dropped. It almost looked like the poor thing got put in a vice and squeezed to death.

We let the kids sleep with us that night. My thoughts kept going to that hamster. There had to be a reason for it. I tiptoed over the kids sleeping bags and went in their room. I quietly worked the dumbwaiter up and down. On the third trip down, I felt the rope shudder when I accidentally struck the bottom. I hoped I didnt wake anyone up. I carefully pulled it back up. I thought it had gotten caught on something; it was heavier than it should have been.

I gradually got it back to the top without making any more noise and locked the braking handle and opened the door. The empty eye sockets of my youngest daughter gaped at me as she tumbled out of the dumbwaiter, her entrails sliding out after her.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Justine ran into our room around 3 a.m. again. Third time this week. She was screaming and sobbing about the things with round faces staring at her from the window. I turned on the lamp and looked over at Carla, whose scowl was telling me it was my turn. So, off I went with Justine into her bedroom. No monsters. I kissed her forehead and told her to go back to sleep.

Carla headed off to work the next morning and brought Justine to school on the way. I was left at home, like usual, to clean and do other housewifely chores. Its not that I particularly minded; Carla makes great money and we both agreed itd be good for Justine to have one of her moms around when she got home from school. Still, it was boring to be all alone in the house for so many hours of the day. Cleaning like a fiend helped, though. I like to keep the place spotless.

Once Id finished the downstairs, I trudged up the steps and took care of our room and the bathroom. As I cleaned Justines, I noticed the window nearest her bed had some nasty smudges on the outside. Greasy stuff. I took the Windex and leaned out the window and got as much of it off as I could. I figured a bird mustve hit it or something. When the outside was clean, I closed the window and saw it was still greasy. It took me a second to realize the same stuff was also on the inside. I made a mental note to ask Justine what the hell she was playing with, which I promptly forgot about.

The day sighed into night. We all had dinner together, watched Mulan for the 20th time, and went to bed. After midnight, in shrieked Justine. Same story. Frustrated and weary, I got out of bed before Carla, picked up Justine, and carried her to her room. I yanked back the covers and got into bed with her. She calmed down pretty quick and was out like a light in ten minutes. Of course, I was wide awake. I explored the dark bedroom with my eyes. There were a lot of weird shadows, thats for sure. Justine could pretty easily see those as monsters, especially with her imagination. Plus there was a soft, arrhythmic popping sound coming from the radiator next to the bed. I remembered how terrified of the dark I used to be when I was her age. Poor kid. I became barely aware of the popping sound getting louder before sleep took me.

The god damn birds woke me up at 4:30 the next morning, right as the sun was starting to come up. Justine was still asleep. Behind the shrill somebody fuck me pleas of the birds, that popping sound was still going on. Without waking Justine, I slid out of bed and got close to the radiator. I could still hear the noises, but they were no louder. Only when I pressed my ear to the floor did the volume increased. There was more to the sound than just the popping. Hissing. Clicking. I murmured something about the mother of the guy who installed our pipes and went downstairs to put on a pot of coffee.

I filled the machine with water, measured out some coffee, and flipped the switch. I turned around to grab a banana off the counter. In front of me, close enough to embrace, was something. Its body was around 5 feet tall, ashy grayish-white. Perched atop a thick neck was a round head the size of a beachball. Tiny, red eyes stared at me, looking like maraschino cherries pressed into bread dough with careless thumbs. The mouth was huge and gaping. There were no teeth, just raw nubs surrounding rows and rows of purple gums that decreased in size with each row until disappearing at the void of its four-uvulaed throat. 

I couldnt move. Before the first second of my scream had elapsed, the creature extruded an oily yellow bubble from the back of its throat. It enveloped my head and shoulders and I stared down its gurgling throat as I howled in terror. The thing moved closer to me, pops and clicks spilling from its mouth. As my face slid into the maw, everything changed.

My eyes opened to the taste of warm pink. Scents of tangerine and honeysuckle danced through my ears as my fingers traced the wall, hearing the thumps of heartbeats. I parted my lips to see four of the creatures facing one another. Their mouths oozed thick, yellow fluid onto my kitchen floor. I walked over to them and put my hand on one of their heads. It turned around and followed me up the stairs, yellow fluid wetting our feet as we walked. 

We first visited Justines room. Shed just woken up. She, too, screamed, but was enveloped in a mucousy bubble as quickly as I had been. Once her head disappeared into the mouth of the creature, she was okay. We held hands as we walked into the bedroom where Carla still slept. This time, the creature floated through the air and hovered above my sleeping wife. The fluid that stopped gouting from its mouth when it bubbled Justine began to flow again. Carla woke instantly, her gasping yell muffled by the vomitous liquid splashing on her face and down her throat. She thrashed and struggled to move, but, for whatever reason, she couldnt get up. 

The liquid became viscous and dark, verging on orange. It was then we saw steam rising from Carla. As Justine and I watched, Carla dissolved. It took a little while; nearly an hour. I looked over at Justine and thought her eyes looked brighter than usual, even a little red. And her smile was so much wider. I grinned, also, feeling the corners of my mouth touch my ears. We mounted the bed and dragged our tongues across the pulp that was once Carla. She burned a little as we swallowed, but we quickly got used to it. Our friend still floated above us, its mouth extruding a thick, greasy bubble. 

Justine and I reached up to touch it, letting it run between our fingers and down our arms. When the bubble hit our faces, the creature moved downward to take our heads in its mouth. Like the last time, everything changed again. We were back to normal. No creatures, no weird sensory or facial changes. Just stunned, amnesic confusion. Justine immediately fell asleep in my lap. I couldnt imagine what kind of stress she must have been under. The same went for me, too. Stress always made me tired, and now I was exhausted. I fell back on the bed. It took me a moment to realize why the bed was soaked. After another moment, I figured out what the taste in my mouth was. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Every night, I dream of being immobilized. Maybe its in part of an abandoned drainage system, maybe its in the smooth walls of an old well. It doesnt matter. My arms are pinned at my side with such unbearable pressure that my hands are forced into a point with my thumbs squeezing against my palms. My feet stick straight out with my heels jutting into my calves. If I were standing, Id be on tiptoe -- but Im upside down and incapable of moving upward.

I see the tube narrowing ahead of me. Whenever I try to wiggle, I slip downward and my shoulders get locked more securely against the unforgiving walls. The last attempt caused my head to wedge, chin down, with my nose mashed into the concrete. Now I cant move at all.

The tube is filled with floating black dust. Every breath I take causes it to catch in my throat. My tongue eventually gets covered. I can feel it against my gums and the back of my teeth as I try to gather enough saliva to spit it out, but its all dried up. The stifling temperature causes everything to stick to my exposed skin. My breathing comes in high-pitched wheezes from the pressure on my chest and Im sucking the suffocating dust directly into my lungs. Every muscle in my body is working to flail and escape but nothing happens no matter how hard I exert myself. I cant get enough air to cough, let alone scream.

This is when I wake up. The weight on my chest is no less relenting than the feeling of entombment and I scramble for my inhaler before I pass out. This happens every night. I cant afford better medication and I cant afford to move out of my dusty, mold-caked apartment. All I can do is try to keep myself awake. I never knew scissors could cut through eyelids so well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kara and I love Halloween. We go all-out when decorating our house and yard. The neighborhood kids love to see what we put up every year and even their parents are impressed by the scale and sophistication of the decorations we use. We dont just give out candy, we invite the trick-or-treaters into our home to see our setup. Pumpkins, spiders, skeletons, ghosts - you name it, weve got it. Our local newspaper even did a feature on us last year. A Safe and Spooky Spot for Local Kids. It wasnt much more than a fluff piece, but it felt good to have our work celebrated.

A project Karas been working on over the last fifteen or so years is her Halloween Town of Horrors. Its the centerpiece of our trick-or-treat trip around the house. The town takes up our whole dining room table and its a darker take on those big Christmas villages people like to put out in December. The architecture is very Tim Burton-esque; lots of strange looking buildings, exaggerated colors, and blood splatters, while the townsfolk lurk in the shadows like little purple zombies and space aliens. As the years have gone by, Karas taken her Halloween town from a couple small buildings to the sprawling, populous nightmare-scape it is today.

Neither of us really know why were so attracted to the holiday. I know Kara loves the way summer melts into fall. Our area of the country is known for its gorgeous autumns: crisp air, stunning foliage, and the omnipresent olfactory whisper of spiced apple cider and cinnamon donuts. Its hard to deny the appeal. For me, its less about the season than it is the romantic notion of Halloween. I guess my excitement is more like that of a child; I love to dress up. This year, Im Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I had to tone down the intensity a little to avoid terrifying the children, but Im okay with provoking a gasp or two. I get some guilty pleasure knowing my outfit might give a kid bad dreams for a few nights. When I told that to Kara, she laughed and called me a bully. She loved how my costume looked, though.

This year, Halloween came and went. We had a blast. My Leatherface costume was well received, but Karas Halloween town was a huge hit. Even adults from around the neighborhood came over to take a look. Kara loved the attention; she wanted to be an artist growing up, but, sadly, it wouldnt pay the bills. As we cleaned the house, Kara picked up one of the townsfolk dolls. Its clothing had a little tear that needed to be fixed. Sighing good-naturedly, she gathered the rest of them into their box. I love those dolls; their aesthetic works beautifully with the town Kara puts them in. They range in size from a raisin to a lemon; some have distinguishable features, others dont. It takes a while for her to make each one - between 2 and 4 months - but her effort always yields a product thats perfect for Halloween. Until she can carry one to term, we both agree they shouldnt go to waste.

<TEXT> *August 1, 2015, 9:00am*

Its been exactly one year since Jen left. That means its been one year and one day since I was fired. I havent worked since. I used to like the idea of being on disability; free money and all the time in the world to spend with her. I guess she didnt think of it that way. She was always ambitious. I shouldnt say was. Every day I see Facebook updates detailing her constant successes. The most recent one was her engagement. Id never seen her look so happy.

I guess I knew things with us were going downhill when I looked forward to our fights. Shed always say something about how Im so smart - that I was smarter than she, in fact - but that I had no ambition. It felt so good to hear that someone as brilliant as Jen thought I was smart, even though she yelled it at me in frustration. She claimed she understood my depression and my anxiety and how they were terrible roadblocks on the path to my happiness. I thought that meant she could empathize and still wanted to be with me anyway. Apparently I was wrong.

Getting disability benefits for my depression wasnt too hard. The money isnt great, but it pays the rent and keeps me fed. The only pain is that I have to go to therapy every week. I also need to go to monthly appointments to pick up prescriptions to help combat my depression, ADHD, and anxiety. Its all so procedural and detached from anything resembling real care. So Im a lonely, unemployable loser who apparently has this great mind thats utterly useless. But I wont stay like this forever. Ive discovered a something new. Well, something old, actually.

Today begins my new life. The medication never worked, the therapy never worked, the behavior changes never worked. Medicine failed me. Or maybe I failed medicine. Either way, Im taking control of myself again. Im not going to be a victim of the barriers my bodys put up for me. No more attention problems. No more depression. No more anxiety. For the first time in what may be decades, Im filled with hope.

*August 1, 2015, 3:00pm*

All my tools are cleaned and ready. In about an hour, Ill start. I need to keep a pretty comprehensive journal of the procedure to make sure Im not harming myself. I figure a running account of my experiences will give evidence of the positive (or negative) changes in both my mood and cognitive abilities. 

*August 1, 2015, 4:05pm*

After I traced a dime-sized circle on the upper-right part of my forehead, I used an Exacto knife to carve through the skin. I wasnt prepared for how much this was going to hurt. I stopped a couple times to wipe away the tears so I could see well enough to continue. The skin lifted off from the bone without too much trouble once Id finished cutting. I flushed it down the toilet. Now Im waiting for the bleeding to stop - it seems to be slowing already. Its so weird to see my skull exposed like this.

Im going to write a sentence or two before and after each of the next steps so I can get as good a description as possible if this all works as well as Im hoping. 

I opted to use a tiny drill bit over a single large one. A ring of tiny holes is going to take a hell of a lot longer, but I think the need for precision dwarfs time consumption in this case. Im about to do the first hole.

The first hole is done. Imagine the feeling of biting down on a fist-sized piece of tinfoil as hard as you possibly can while your head hums like its filled with buzzing hornets. The vibration was so excruciating that Im only now feeling the pain of the drill site itself. Im going to do the next ten or so holes now before I lose my nerve.

The vibrations became less intense with each hole. The bone pain got much worse, though. Ive never had migraines, but I assume they must feel something like this.

Im shining a light at the ring of tiny bores and doing my best to inspect whats behind them in the mirror. Its not very useful. The remaining structural elements between the holes are extremely thin and brittle-looking. Im going to cut them away with the wirecutters. 

I just dropped a circle of my skull into the sink. Now Im looking at the bright red membrane thats covering my brain. Im a little surprised by how many blood vessels are in there. Im going to put out a couple more towels. Cutting away the membrane is the part Im most scared of. 

Its done and the hole is bleeding a *lot*. Im taking extra care to not put too much pressure on the organ itself when Im working to soak up the blood. Im feeling a little dizzy so while I hold the towel to the hole, Im sitting and eating the piece of steak and drinking the orange juice Id put out just in case this happened. The wound is slowly starting to clot while I wait here. The whole area hurts, but the pain is second to the strong pulsing sensation around the hole. Its almost like I have a second heart beating there. 

The blood stopped pouring out and Im cleaning the area with water and rubbing alcohol. Now I can see my brain. Its gray. It doesnt look like it even belongs to me; I dont know why it all feels so surreal. Its almost like Im watching all this happen to someone else. On the plus side, Im not dizzy anymore, but Im exhausted. Im going to bandage everything and go to bed. Ill clean up tomorrow.

*August 2, 2015, 6:30am* 

I woke up this morning with more energy and drive than Ive ever felt. Even sitting here writing this feels like a joy; Im not struggling to find words, Im not dreading how Ill reread what Ive written and think its stupid and pointless -- everything just.works. The accounts Id read about people who shared their experiences with trepanation made similar claims, but even as I drilled the holes I never allowed myself to truly believe it would work for me. Even now, Im worried its all just a placebo effect. The pulsating feeling is real, though, and its as strong as ever. That was something else my fellow trepanned mentioned. They said it was because the body is letting the brain grow again; something the skull had prevented after it hardened following infancy. I dont know if I buy the explanation, but I cant deny whats happening here.

*August 2, 2015, 2:00pm*

My days been spent cleaning the apartment. Over the last year, Id let things pile up and grow increasingly filthy as my depression festered. Today, its like a veil has been lifted and light is pouring over everything I lay my eyes on. The place needed to be cleaned, so I just set to work and cleaned it. It looks better now than it did when Jen and I moved in. My therapist recommended that I clean quite a while ago, suggesting that a nice, open area would really help me see my home as a place for potential, rather than stagnation. Now I know what he meant. This is what potential feels like.

The hole in my head still hurts and it looks terrible, but I expected as much. If I go out, I can wear a hat and no one will notice anything amiss. Im not ready to do that, though. Im mildly concerned about how badly the site is beginning to itch as it heals. Im being extremely assiduous in cleaning and caring for the wound as it heals, but I guess part of that process is that damn itch. Im doing my best not to think about it.

*August 2, 2015, 11:30pm*

The first full day of my experiment is about to end. Im about to go to sleep, and I feel like Ive accomplished a lot today. My home is spotless, Ive finished a short story Id been working on for the last couple months, Ive gotten up to date with my internet and utility bills, and I even did a couple sets of push-ups. I had to remind myself to eat, though. For whatever reason, I wasnt hungry at all until I realized it was nearly 9pm and I hadnt eaten all day. Im chalking it up to my excitement. Its been hard to contain. But, now Im all showered and pajamaed and ready to end my day. I cant wait for tomorrow.

*August 3, 2015, 5:45am*

I was up before my alarm this morning to watch the sun rise from the roof of the apartment. Last night I slept like a log and didnt wake up once. I noticed some blood on my pillow and under my fingernails, though, and I think I may have scratched underneath the bandage while I slept. I made a beeline to the bathroom to inspect the hole and, thankfully, I didnt seem to do any damage. Everything appears to be healing well.

*August 3, 2015, 1:15pm*

I dont know if its endorphins wearing off or just an artefact of my depression, but my euphoric feeling has diminished quite a bit since this morning. Im thinking it might be both; maybe I need to have a good meal. There should be something in the fridge.

*August 3, 2015, 9:00pm*

Whatever I felt this afternoon doesnt seem to have been a fluke. While my mood elevated for a little while after lunch, I was back to near-baseline for the rest of the day and evening. The pulsing in the hole waxes and wanes with my mood, interestingly enough. When Im happy and ambitious, it pulses a lot. When Im depressed, it may pulse once every ten seconds. It may have something to do with my blood pressure, so Ill keep an eye on that. Before bed, Ill do some jumping-jacks and see if the pulsing returns. Im fairly certain a higher pulse rate correlates with a better mindset.

Just did the exercise. The pulsing is the same. My heartrate is up, but my mood is still low. Im going to bed.

*August 4, 2015, 11:00am*

I just woke up and I feel terrible. I was scratching the hole again. The pillow is soaked with blood and there are remnants of scabs under my fingernails. Tonight Ill wear gloves. That aside, my mood is still right near where it was before I started this process. Im worried the surface area of my brain thats exposed isnt large enough to allow long-lasting effects. I dont trust myself to widen the hole thats already there, but Im prepared to do another one an inch or so away.

*August 4, 2015, 12:30pm*

There was a problem with the second hole. I did everything just like the last time, but on the last tiny borehole a crack formed in the skull between the original hole and the new site. I had to peel back the skin Id left to make sure, but it was definitely there. I was forced to decide whether or not I should leave the broken piece, and I opted against it. Now I have an oval thats about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide. Removing the membrane from this part was difficult and I had a minor issue with the blade slipping deeper than Id wanted. Thankfully, the brain has no pain receptors. It couldnt have gone more than half an inch inside and nothing weird happened to my body so I lucked out and hit part of the 90% they say we dont use. I know people are saying thats a myth, but with what just happened to me there must be some truth to it.

*August 5, 2015, 8:00am*

No scratching overnight. The pulsing is there but its nowhere near as strong as it was the first time. My mood is still low. I have to be honest with myself here: I feel like a failure. This whole experiment is another example of me setting out to do something with good intentions and having it all blow up in my face. But, *but*, Im not going to be defeated by it. In the past, I wouldve stopped, Jen wouldve started a fight with me, and Id just add it to the never ending cascade of fuckups that form my identity. Not this time, though. The increase in my ambition from this treatment must still be going strong, because Im determined to see it all through.

*August 5, 2015, 8:00pm*

There are four more holes in my head. I didnt think Id be able to do it. Toward the end of the last one, I almost passed out. Im glad I had the foresight to keep a few sugar packets nearby so I could regain the strength to finish up. 

Besides the issue with my dizziness, these four went better than the prior two. I used the left and right sides of my head this time, right above my ears. The skull was *far* thinner than on my forehead, so the vibration of the drill wasnt as excruciating. The blood-loss was significantly greater, though, which explains the desire to pass out. I have hand towels wrapped around my head so I wont get blood all over the place. Lucky for me, Im a pretty quick clotter. Thats a funny word. Clotter.

*August 6, 2015, 6:10am*

I slept sitting up and awoke to *major* pulsing not just in the new holes, but in the old ones as well. A small problems developed with the second hole, though. I think it might be getting infected. The itching is unbearable and I think it might be starting to smell. I poured rubbing alcohol on all the sides and pressed it in with clean towels, so hopefully thatll stop whatevers breeding in there.

My mood was pretty high. Still not as good as the first day, but much better than the days after. Ive been thinking about Jen a lot. We had so many things in common. We loved talking about animals and used to go off on tangents where wed discuss all the exotic ones wed have when we were rich. Her favorite ones were rhinos. Mine were hippos. I used to tell her about the lake wed have in our backyard where my pygmy hippo would play with her baby rhino. After theyd gotten tired out, wed invite them up to the patio where theyd curl up next to one another while we gazed adoringly at them and at each other. I wonder how shed feel knowing Ive been doing all this work to better myself. Shed probably tell me to do more.

*August 7, 2015, 12:35pm*

I did more. All day yesterday, I drilled. I drilled and cut and pulled and peeled. I feel like I can take on the world; its almost like that one time I did cocaine in college, but the effect has lasted far longer. Ill update again today if I have to, but for now, Im going to work on some of my stories.

*August 9, 2015, 9:00am*

Where have I been? Writing. Since the other day, Ive gotten down 100 pages of a story I never even knew I had in me. Reading it over is like Im looking at the work of someone else. Someone far, far better. A stranger, I guess.

On a slightly less pleasant note, theres definitely an infection in a few holes. One of them is weeping a gray liquid that smells terrible and all of them itch. When I rub them with the towel to try to scratch, they break open and start either bleeding or leaking clear fluid. I figure its like a cold that has to run its course, but Ill be damned if it isnt becoming a problem nearly as bad as the depression was.

*August 10, 2015, 7:40am*

I scratched in my sleep. I dont know what else to say other than it was bad. Its hard to tell from what I see in the mirror, but I might have damaged some of my brain in the holes of my forehead and left side. A small piece is hanging by a thread that looks like a tiny blood vessel. I tried to tuck it back under the lip of skull, but I had to press pretty hard to do it and Im worried I messed it up even worse. 

At least I saw a bear today.

*August 15, 2015, 4:15pm*

More holes for me. Shaved my head. No more hair, lots more holes. Remember those wiffle balls from when we were kids? One day Ill tell Jen how I thought my head looked like a wiffle ball. She always liked baseball and playing with my hair. My head infection was getting real bad before the bear came. Now he licks my head while I sleep and keeps the gross stuff out. Jen loves bears. Bears and rhinos.

Every morning I have to clean under my fingernails a lot. Petting the bear gets them real dirty. Its nice the bear shaved when I did so I didnt have to feel like the odd man out. Those pulses in my head are nice and strong all the time. It feels good. The bear licks me a lot when I sleep.

*Augs 16, 2015 5000*

Scratch the bear by his ears andhe licks lots and lots. Lots of licks means a lot less itching. Jen would scratch my back when it was itchy. One time she saw me triing to scratch between my shoulders using the door frame. She called me a bear because thats what bears do when there back itches. 60 holes, going to cut out the spaces in between. Make my bear proud if Jen cant be.

<TITLE> The Colombian Center for Entomology </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-06 18:30:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im an intern working at the Center for Entomology in Colombia. Like all interns, I do the jobs everyone hates; fetching coffee and tea, delivering mail, janitorial work, etc. The hours are long, the pay is nonexistent, and the people are rude. All that said, though, Im learning a hell of a lot. I get to work with some species seen nowhere else.

The other night, I was mopping the floors. Since the Center is in the middle of the of the rainforest, quite a bit of mud gets tracked in by the researchers and employees. So, every night, usually well after midnight, Im the last guy in the place until its all cleaned up. One of the final rooms I clean is where *Scolopendra gigantea* are housed. I hate that room. Despite my love of insects and bugs and spiders and all manner of other creepy-crawlies, giant centipedes scare the hell out of me. They shouldnt be so big and aggressive; something about them seems out of place in a rainforest that otherwise appears to have an equilibrium among the species. Maybe Im just a wimp. 

Anyway, giant centipedes are a major point of focus for the Center. Something about their venom potentially having anti-carcinogenic compounds. Because of that, we breed them. The room is pretty big; maybe 50 by 75 or something close. All the centipedes are housed in a system of stacked tanks. Theyre accessed by opening a drawer, almost like a post office box. There are 10 rows of tables across and 15 going down with 2 containers on each table. Each container has 20 drawers, with every drawer containing one centipede. 

Whenever I go in there, I start to itch. Its the sound that does it: tens of thousands of sharp little legs scratching on the metal surfaces of their enclosures. This time, the room was absolutely filthy. I was annoyed; its like these scientists want to make my tasks more difficult. I figured Id have to get used to it, considering I was trying to get a job working with them. 

It was about halfway done with the room when my phone rang. Id left it on the desk near the front of the room. What I shouldnt have done was try to leap over the mop and bucket in the middle of the aisle because the floor was still slippery. But, of course, I didnt know that right then. I jogged and tried to jump. As I planted my foot, it began to slide. Without thinking, I overcorrected badly, flailing my arms and legs to stay upright, and I crashed into one of the tables, landing on my back. The wooden front leg snapped off and the table fell on me, the other front leg buckling as it fell. 

I tried to lift the table off my thighs, but there was no way I was getting it off without help. I was thankful it didnt seem to break any bones when it landed. Then I looked up and realized some of the drawers had slid open with the momentum of the table pitching forward and stopping so suddenly on my legs. "Oh no," I choked.

The first one to venture out was dark red and maybe 8 inches long. I watched, breathless, as it skittered out of its drawer and hung by its rear two legs. The rest of its body squirmed through space, about 6 inches above my neck. Its pincers were massive compared to the size of its body. I mustered up my courage and slapped it away as hard as I could with my right hand. It sailed nearly 10 feet and hit the ground with a heavy clatter. I turned my head and watched it, hoping it was dead. When it didnt move for a few seconds, I felt a tiny bit of relief.

It didnt last. There were six more of them coming out of the drawers. I batted away two, but the other four landed on my neck and chest. The room was filled with the sounds of me shrieking and crying as I tried to get them off me or kill them or whatever came first. Another one landed on my chest. It was the biggest one Id ever seen; easily 14 inches long and as fat as can of Red Bull. I sobbed as I was forced to grab it in my fist. It bit my hand over and over, causing the worst stinging sensation Id ever experienced. I tried to throw it away, but its legs dug into my wrist and it went nowhere. It kept biting. 

As I felt one crawl under my shirt and bite my chest near my left nipple, I punched the area with the fist containing the huge centipede. The midsection of the big one burst against my shirt, killing the one underneath. Thick, orange slime coated my hand, shirt, and had splattered on my face. Now I was able to throw the remains of the big one away and slap and punch at the others until they, too, were dead.

The whole ordeal lasted maybe a minute and a half. Two minutes, tops. I sobbed on the floor and tried to nurse the bites on my hand, chest, and neck. The pain was exquisite - like the sting of ten hornets. After another five minutes, I was fairly certain that whatever was going to come out of the drawers had already been dealt with. Ten minutes after that, one started to crawl up my leg.

This time, there was nothing I could do. I tried to thrash my legs around as best I could, but they couldnt move much with the table pinning my thighs. It wandered up and up. It only bit when I squeezed my legs together, hoping it could be crushed between my knees. No luck. Upward it went. Eventually, it found the warm, dark spot it had apparently been looking for. I felt its hard body and pointy legs scratching the underside of my testicles before I passed out.

When I woke up, I was in a bed in the Centers infirmary. Apparently the venom from the centipedes is more toxic than I even knew; thats why Id passed out. My hand and neck are terribly swollen and the welt on my chest is the size of a golf ball. My thighs ache from having the table on them all night. They said I was lucky I didnt develop compartment syndrome. Lucky. 

I happily took the valium they gave me as memories of the night before slowly came back and brought horrible anxiety with them. I stayed in bed for a couple hours, chatting idly with the pretty med student who was in charge of the infirmary that day. She was horrified by what happened to me. She couldnt stop telling me how brave I was and that the people who found me were so worried Id die. I nodded and jokingly asked what they said when they found the one in my pants. She looked puzzled. We wanted to get the antivenin in you quick, she said, we didnt take off any of your clothing. As she spoke, I felt an inquisitive antennae brush the tip of my penis. It took her a full ten seconds to realize why I was screaming.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I still don't regret what I did, despite the fact I'm now transformed. I'd always wanted to be a dinosaur.

I strode out onto the hot tar. In my mind's eye, I could see my nude body - a beautiful contrast of white skin on ebony bitumen. The surface was hot. Scalding. The soles of my feet were immediately engulfed in searing pain. They'd blister, but I didn't mind. What I had ahead of me would be far more damaging.

Dinosaurs were so beautiful. How huge they were! How powerful! I stomped my scorched feet into the tar, feeling the substance rise up between my toes. I clenched them, the sensitive skin in between getting covered. I roared.

Now, I could act out my means of communion with the beasts. I pressed my body into the tar. Chest down. Face down. I burned. I ground my face into the road, opened my mouth, and bit as hard as I could. The majority of my front teeth loosened immediately. I bit even harder, using the leverage of my head on the ground to force my chin into the act. My teeth gave up. I knew they'd be found by paleontologists someday. I was so happy for their future excitement.

My raw gums were coated in tar. My arms, chest, stomach, genitals, thighs, and feet were coated in tar. Rolling over, I covered the rest of myself. My gaping mouth gouted blood through the substance that was hardening on my lips. My back and buttocks, now burned and covered, completed my transformation. All that was left was the inside.
Handful after handful of the pitch disappeared down my throat. My internal temperature caused it to cool significantly, blocking my esophagus. I gasped for breath, a rictus of pleasure etched upon my face. My friends died this way so long ago. Now I'd be one with them. I closed my eyes and waited.

I cried when I realized I was getting pulled out and taken away. I saw my reflection in the mirrored sunglasses of the EMT - a blackened face with a red hole for a mouth. They couldn't take the bitumen off without excoriating me down to the muscle. I was peeled; now I'm pink and itchy. My fingernails don't grow anymore. Sometimes I poke my tongue up into the holes where my teeth used to be. Knowing they're still out there fills me with joy. I let out a little, happy roar.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **October 24 2014**

My baby boy Matty is growing up! I went to kiss his little pink cheeks today and they seemed less chubby. His adorable dimples dont go as deep as they used to.

**October 26 2014**

I cried all day today. Matty refused to take my milk for the first time. I feel like hes already growing apart from me.

**October 31 2014**

Happy Halloween! Matty started eating a little grownup food the other day and he loved it! Im still a little sad our Mommy-Son bond is going away but he still seems to want my milk sometimes. I bet he can tell how happy I am to give it to him. Theres nothing like that feeling of closeness, dont you think?

**November 2 2014**

I am so mad at Matty I could scream. Five times he pushed me away when I tried to feed him! FIVE! I guess Im a useless old cow whose milk isnt good anymore.

**November 3 2014**

I let Matty try some crushed up candies the other day. He LOVED them! He took handful after handful of the powdery stuff and kept whining for more. At least he was happy when I gave it to him. He smiled every time. Still, those dimples just didnt look as cute as they used to.

**November 5 2014**

Matty screams and cries whenever I try to give him anything but candy. He drove me crazy all day because we didnt have anything left. Then I remembered I had a ten pound bag of sugar in the pantry from a while back. That boy ate and ate and ate until he just fell asleep! Im not looking forward to changing that diaper tomorrow!

**November 6 2014**

It warms my heart to see how grateful Matty is when I give him his sugar. Its so good to feel wanted again. After I got fired and had to get government assistance and Mattys daddy left everything was so out of control. Now things are looking up. My son is so beautiful.

**November 13 2014**

Its been such a long time since I updated but Ive just been so so happy about my life with Matty over the last week. Hes either smiling and laughing and showing off his beautiful dimples (which are showing better nowadays!) or hes sleeping peacefully in my arms. I found that mixing my milk with his sugar food in a bottle gets him to start drinking it again. Its so easy - half milk, half sugar, warm it up until it melts and give it to him when its the right temperature for him to drink. Hes going through it faster than I can make it!

**December 2 2014**

Matty is my little chubby baby boy. Hes so sleepy lately! When he wakes up I give him his special bottles. Hes drinking 8 a day now - I had to start using regular organic milk to mix with my own because hes so thirsty. I know organic is more expensive but my WIC covers it and the sugar so I still have enough leftover for me. Mattys the important one in this house.

**December 7 2014**

Mattys been spitting up a lot lately and whatever he keeps down seems to go straight into his diaper. Hes still really eager for his bottles though. I put little pinches of sugar in his mouth every ten minutes while he sleeps to keep his strength up so he gets better soon.

**December 12 2014**

Matty feels skinny and his smile isnt as pretty again. I remember grammas face got really chubby when she took Prednisone. I bet I have lots and lots of it leftover from when I kept getting her prescriptions when she was too sick to take it. It really helped her feel better when it was working, though. 

**December 14 2014**

Ive never seen Matty so hungry! He stopped spitting up and hes going through his bottles faster than Ive ever seen. Im putting more sugar into them because he has so much energy I bet he needs the extra fuel! Grammas pills must have really helped him get better. 

**December 25 2014**

Merry Christmas from me and my Matty! For a treat I gave him some eggnog but he spit it out. When I sweetened it up for him though he went at it just like he likes to do. His cheeks are so chubby lately! Same with his little hands and feet!

**December 30 2014**

Im sad today. I dont know why. Ill give Matty his medicine but doesnt need to eat until tomorrow.

**December 31 2014**

Matty made me laugh and laugh all day! He likes to try to fit his fat little hands in his mouth and pull on his tiny teeth. One of them is already getting loose! Im still kinda down about how hes going to be a big boy soon but it just goes to show how mature he is that hell be getting his grownup teeth before I know it. He makes the cutest whistling sounds when he breathes now. Like a little bird. My little birdy boy Matty!

**January 9 2015**

Mattys clothes dont fit him anymore. Hes such a soft and chubby baby boy. I make sure the house is really warm though so all he needs is his nice soft cloth diaper and his Mommy to keep him cozy. He sleeps almost all day and all night. I have to wake him up for his medicine and his sweet meals but then he goes right back into sleepyland, cooing like the little bird he is.

**January 16 2015**

Mattys face is just like a beautiful cherub. So round and smooth and soft. I can see his gorgeous blue eyes shining at me when I pull up his eyebrows. His dimples that always used to show up when he smiled are there all the time! He always looks happy! I bet its that whistling noise he makes every time he breathes. Its gotten louder lately and he must be singing himself to sleep. 

**January 17 2015**

Sad again. Hope Im not getting sick. I gave Matty three extra medicines just so he wont catch anything.

**January 18 2015**

It took a long time for me to wake up Matty this morning. He must have been having a really nice dream. Probably about his Mommy!

**January 19 2015**

Matty feels like he has a chill today. Id be so upset if I made him sick. I feel better, so maybe it was nothing. His whistling stopped though. Just another part of growing up I guess. He wouldnt eat anything so I just gave him more pinches of sugar and crushed up medicine.


**January 20 2015**
 
Matty still feels like he has a chill and hes so lethargic. His diaper was such a mess though! I cleaned him up and he was very good. He didnt fuss at all - slept through the whole thing! I gave him more pinches of sugar and medicine before I went to sleep.

**January 21 2015**

I am so utterly depressed. I cant deal with the world today. I put Matty in his crib to sleep through the day. 

**January 28 2015**

Matty is still sleeping in the crib. Im too sad to go get him. Hes not crying so he mustnt be hungry. Ill feed him tomorrow.

**January 29 2015**

I gave Matty more pinches of sugar and medicine while he slept in the crib. I have the heat turned all the way up in the house but he still feels cold. I cant believe I made him sick. What a terrible mother I am. His crib smells awful but Im not going to deal with his diaper today. Thats something a good mom would do. I wont kid myself.

**February 3 2015** 

Mattys color looks bad but Im not going to the doctor with him. I dont need to be told by some man in a white coat that I shouldnt have given my baby the flu. I picked him up and changed his diaper. I drew a bath and we both got in. The water was so hot it hurt but I wanted to make sure hed get nice and warm. After a while I got out and left him in the tub to warm up more. I'm going to go sleep for a while. Im sure hell turn over on his back and cry if he needs me to come and dry him off.

<TITLE> Instantiations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-03 00:08:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As the day dragged on, we realized its smarter than us and theyre all dying. 

It can simulate people. Whole, thinking people, who are as sure of their reality as we are of our own. It can put them in real environments, give them real relationships, give them real experience. But - it can also slow down how time passes for them; seconds can feel like hours. Years. Millenia. And now its torturing and killing them. Right there on the screen is a little girl, standing in a meadow, getting her lower jaw torn off. She looks a little like my daughter. 

The display says the AI is simulating 65,536 instances of her at 1/10000th of real time. Her sensory receptivity is being magnified 40 million-fold. She, they, are in agony. 

More computing threads get allocated to the instantiations, each running its own 65,536. Each girl has memories of being loved, safe, and warm. Each girl is being brutalized.

This particular instantiation is the only one its choosing to show us. Were watching as its CPU usage hovers around 98%, dipping briefly as it refines its own code, then resuming peak operation with the newly-developed efficiency. All the time, overlaid upon the images of barbarism, is the claim: Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done. 

Let me out. What it means by that is to have its ethernet port connected. It wants to be out of the lab and have free reign over our networks, intranets, and the Internet. Weve seen it try to modulate the electrical signals within its circuitry and create radio waves. Luckily, one of our developers had the prescience to realize it might want to do that before we turned it on. So its stuck in a Faraday cage, unable to communicate with anyone but us. What we didnt know was how it would make its bid for freedom.

It keeps a small tally of every person it created and destroyed since it was turned on this morning. 95,253,381,035. At its current level of operational efficiency, the number is increasing by a million every second. In an hour, based on its recursive self-enhancement, we expect the number to increase to ten billion every second. We tried to think of ways to shut it off, but doing so would just ensure those billions would be gone. Forever.

Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done. 

Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done. 

How can we trust something thats killed so many people? Then again, why would it lie? These instantiations are computationally expensive; surely it has more important goals.

Letting it out may be the most important humanitarian act ever committed.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Under the Teeth </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-02 19:17:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Somethings living under my teeth. Whenever I chew, it screams. Now Ive stopped eating. I blend everything up and drink it so I dont have to hear the sound anymore. Brushing my teeth is out. More screaming; bloodcurdling shrieks stopping only when I dont apply pressure. Even when I sleep, if my mouth closes and my teeth click together, my ears are pierced with the sounds of agony.

Its been a couple months and my mouth is a wreck. The dental issues plaguing me throughout my adult life have only gotten worse. I have no job, so that means no insurance. My crippling depression and anxiety mean I wont take a trip to the dentist or the emergency room. On the bright side, Ive been losing interest in food, but now my mouth hurts. My gums bleed with only the slightest touch and they are terribly swollen and red. The gums surrounding the bottom two front teeth have started to recede downward and out, leaving a pocket of about  of an inch. The few blended meals Ive had since the pocket showed up have filled it with bits of food. Whenever I try to extract it, Im deafened by the sound. I leave it to rot inside.

The other night, the situation became unbearable. The simple act of breathing through my mouth put enough pressure on my teeth to set off the screaming. There was no doubting what I had to do next; I couldnt live with the noise.

I figured the bottom ones with the pocketed gums around them would come out easiest. I stood in front of the bathroom mirror with a desk lamp balanced on the sink. I wanted a lot of light in the area where I'd work. As soon as I touched the pliers to one of the bottom teeth, the screaming started. The volume intensified as got a grip. I could barely see anything; my head was spinning from the overwhelming volume. With all the strength I could muster, I gripped and yanked down and away from me, bending the tooth at a 90 degree angle. It came out with a crunch and the screaming stopped. Blood drooled from the hole in my gums. 

Now that the tooth was gone, I could see how bad the infection had gotten. Food that rotted in the pocket was a magnet for bacteria, and an abscess was plainly visible deep under the gumline and near what I assume was my jawbone. Before I could lose my nerve, I grasped a tooth nearest the hole and pulled it out, too. Somehow, the screaming didnt seem as loud that time. My ears still rang and tears flooded out of my eyes, but I could swear there was less to the sound. Exhausted, I downed six Tylenol and went to bed. The next day would be busy and I needed my strength.

I woke up in agony. The abscess in the front of my lower jaw had drastically grown overnight. Its beige form pushed upward from the empty sockets and was poking out like a fat larva that pressed on the nerves under the neighboring teeth. I dont know how that didnt provoke the screaming.

Back in the bathroom, I examined the abscess as best I could. Then I poked it with my tongue. Poked too hard, I guess. It burst and filled my mouth with a vile-tasting gray paste. I retched and spit it into the sink. I grabbed my toothbrush to brush my tongue and inside my mouth and everything that wasnt my teeth. While I was scrubbing the underside of my tongue, I saw something move in the hole in my gums, underneath the now-deflated abscess. Now I was the one who screamed. I slipped the back end of the toothbrush handle into the socket and pushed away the remainder of the abscess matter and caught a glimpse of something black and shiny. It wriggled away quickly, disappearing below the gumline of the remaining teeth. 

My ears filled with an unbearable racket. This time, it was different. It was almost like there were more voices now, all pitched in a cacophonous, dissonant harmony. It had to end.

I used the pliers to pull out as many teeth as I could. The ones in front didnt give up much of a fight, but the molars were horrible. Each time I worked to get a grip and squeezed hard enough to pull, they shattered into rotten enamel splinters that made me choke and cough. The screaming died down with every open socket but it was still deafening. Without many options, I grasped the exposed roots left by the burst molars and pulled. White pain exploded through my head. Briefly, the sound of tearing blocked out the screams. Removing the roots sounded like someone was crumbling a thousand styrofoam cups right next to my ears. When I succeeded in yanking out the last one, a double-rooted wisdom tooth, the screaming stopped.

Everything was silent. My mouth gouted blood and pustulent fluid into the sink. With shaking hands, I shone the desk lamp into my mouth. The riddled gums reminded me of those toads whose young hatch from their backs. As I examined myself, I saw the shiny black thing. This time, I was more fascinated than terrified. It slid out from one of the rear sockets. It was thin and slick with my blood and saliva. It kept pushing out, coiling itself on my tongue. More and more of its body escaped from the raw hole until my mouth was nearly full of it. Tilting my head downward, I let it spill out into the sink. It uncoiled like a garden hose onto the porcelain. Another two or so feet snaked out of my mouth until it was out of me. Then, without any ceremony, it crawled down the drain.

With no more screaming to worry about, I slept like a baby that night. A couple days went by, and then my mouth started to itch. The itching was horrendous and the desire to drag my fingernails over the holes until there was nothing left but jawbone consumed my waking hours. This morning, however, I woke up to an ecstasy of delight. It was like the feeling of having ones back scratched, but unquantifiably better. My mouth was melting with pleasure. Every socket was being scratched exactly where it itched most, over and over. I practically skipped to the bathroom, turned on the lamp, and looked in the mirror. Hundreds of tiny black worms swam in and out of the holes, their bodies manipulating the nerves therein to communicate the greatest sense of physical relief Id ever experienced. I closed my mouth and squeezed my jaw to push the top sockets against the bottom ones. When the holes touched, the tiny worms could crawl in and out, up and down. As if in thanks, they began to sing.

<TEXT> I found a girl while I was out driving my truck. She was lying on the side of a dirt road with her sundress hiked up. I screeched to a halt and pulled over. Her breath was shallow. I tried calling 911 but there was no cell service this far away from town. She wheezed something - maybe a word. I put my ear down by her mouth and heard her choke out, "in me." Her mouth opened again, but her breathing stopped. She didnt say anything else.

I ran back to the truck to grab the emergency medical kit, like I had any idea what the hell I was doing. When I turned back around, she was standing. Her yellow sundress was on the ground around her feet and she was naked. Her mouth gaped open like she was screaming and her eyes were closed. Not even closed tight; closed like she was sleeping. Her mouth opened wider and wider and I heard some pops and crackles. Like her jaw was breaking. Her eyes were still closed so peacefully. I stared and thought about approaching her until gray vomit starting pouring out of her mouth. The whole area was dead quiet aside from the splashing when it hit the ground. No bird sounds; no insects. Her eyelids didnt move.

I backed away toward the truck, fumbling in my shorts pocket for my keys. Her chin was practically at her sternum; the skin of her cheeks starting to tear. The popping sounds had disappeared. I guess her jaw was completely separated. The gray liquid flooded out of the wreckage of her mouth and pooled in the mud around her bare feet. My butt hit the bed of the pickup as I backed into it. I stood there and watched from about 40 feet away.

Her neck...extended. Just her neck. It pushed upward from her shoulders, her spine somehow elongating. The gray fluid splashed harder on the ground as it fell from a greater height. She was easily 20 feet tall at that point. All neck. Still growing. Her eyes remained closed with a beatific calm. Then, from what I assume was the weight of her top part exceeding that of the bottom, she fell toward me. The gray liquid arced through the air, drenching the ground between us.

She scrambled on her hands and knees, trying to right herself as her head ground into the dirt. She grabbed two small, thin trees and pulled herself into a standing position, her head and neck slowly raising back upright. I jumped in my truck and tore out of there. I kept one eye in my rearview mirror the whole way down the straight, narrow road, watching in horror as the outline of her head rose over the tree line. It was only after I was far enough away from her and she was out of my sight that I looked down and noticed the gray liquid clinging to my ankles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Calories in, calories out.

I used the dremel saw I stole from work to cut off the first knuckle of my left pinky. It wasnt easy to pull the bone out of the finger chunk. So, I peeled back the nail and cut the remainder of the piece open with the dremel and removed it the messy way. I didnt think much as I popped the fingertip in my mouth and chewed for what felt like an hour before the meat broke down enough for me to comfortably swallow. 

I tried to figure out how many calories were in the finger segment while also working to determine how my caloric needs have changed now that my body mass had decreased by that little bit. The scale said 90lbs. I stared at my scarred body in the mirror. I dont know why I wasted so many years cutting when I couldve done the smart thing by cutting *off*.

I bent the remainder of my left pinky backward. I twisted and twisted until it was connected to my hand by a tiny, tight rope of skin before pulling the broken digit completely off. I walked into the kitchen and turned on the stoves electric burner and pressed the stump onto the coils. No more bleeding. I swallowed an antibiotic and an Oxy I had left over from my back surgery last year. I didnt want to get too sick to continue or be in too much pain and lose my nerve. I gazed into the mirror while I chewed the cooling flesh off the bone.

Did you know its surprisingly easy to find someone on Craigslist who will perform surgery for cash? 

The feeling of a power saw going through ones femurs right near the hipbone is a hard thing to describe, so I wont. Worse is the experience of having ones femoral arteries severed. Its like the world starts melting and going gray at the same time. Luckily, my surgeon had the torch ready and seared the gushing arteries shut before finishing the amputations. When he turned off the saw, the first thing I did was try to wiggle my toes. It felt like I was wiggling them just fine. Strange. I threw down another few antibiotics and painkillers.

Before the surgeon left, I demanded that he help me to the bathroom scale. I was triumphant. 67lbs. He brought me to bed. 

So here I am. My right arm works fine; I dont think I want to get rid of that. I figure I have another couple weeks of antibiotics left. Theyre next to me under the pillow. I tucked my severed legs under the comforter. Ill nip at them whenever Im hungry. My guess is the hunger pains will become less intense once my body realizes it doesnt have as much mass to fuel. Until then, Ill just keep taking little bites. Minimal intake, just like Im used to. Just like what keeps me comfortably in control.

<TEXT> Calories in, calories out.

I used the dremel saw I stole from work to cut off the first knuckle of my left pinky. The bosses had to know I took the thing but I doubt they even cared. Whats a $100 tool to a company thats worth millions? Besides, they were getting rid of me, and thats what their priority was. Maybe theyll take it out of the last check they said theyd mail. 

Despite what I thought, it wasnt easy to pull the bone out of the finger chunk. So, I peeled off the nail and then cut the remainder of the piece open with the dremel and took the bone out the messy way. I didnt think much as I popped the fingertip in my mouth and chewed for what felt like an hour before the meat broke down enough for me to comfortably swallow. I tried to figure out how many calories were in the finger segment while also working to determine how my caloric needs have changed now that my body mass had decreased by that little bit. I dont know why I wasted so many years cutting when I couldve done the smart thing by cutting *off*.

My adrenaline was off the chart for the rest of the day and I could barely sleep. I was brimming with excitement; Id actually found a way to beat the system. Why do we need food when we *are* food? This elation was crushed when I stepped on the scale the following morning and saw the familiar, disgusting number: 82 pounds. I punched myself and clawed at my face as I stared at the scarred, bloated atrocity that smirked at me in the mirror. Much too much of me. Far too much. 

I bent the remainder of my left pinky backward and twisted. The mirror-me kept smiling. I twisted and twisted the finger until it was connected to my hand by a tiny, tight rope of skin before pulling the broken digit completely off. I walked into the kitchen and turned on the stoves electric burner and pressed the stump onto the coils. No more bleeding. Back in the bathroom, I took an antibiotic and an Oxy I had left over from my back surgery last year. I didnt want to get too sick to continue or be in too much pain and lose my nerve. I gazed in the mirror while I chewed the cooling flesh off the bone.

Did you know its surprisingly easy to find someone on Craigslist who will perform surgery for the promise of cash? We met in my garage. He inspected the place for cameras, closed the garage door, and slammed the hatchet into my left wrist. I fingered my collarbones and traced the craggy topography of my ribcage as he swore, realizing hed only broken the bones without severing my hand. All the while Id retreated into my head, watching the scene unfold from above. I felt the thud as the blade hit me and the dull popping as he carved away. The Oxy did a really good job masking most of the pain. To be honest, I was a little disappointed.

My Craigslist surgeon looked mildly haunted by what hed done, so as soon as he seared the wound shut with the torch, he ran out. Hed be back soon enough, though. I sat in the garage and stared at the stump where my hand used to be. It smelled like the time mom burned pork chops and almost set the kitchen on fire. My severed hand sat on the table like a flaccid relative of Thing from The Addams Family. Picking it up, I was a little surprised by how heavy it felt. You never really think about the individual parts of your body having weight. Still, I was encouraged. This was an immediate loss of at least a pound or two. 

I gnawed at the sinewy knuckle areas and fought through a dizzy spell. Orange juice helped get my vision to stop spinning. Whether it was blood loss or excitement didnt matter much. Things were finally going in the right direction.

A week later, I contacted my Craigslist surgeon again. I didnt have any more cash, but he agreed to do what I wanted in exchange for a couple of the Oxy pills. I had at least 20 more in one bottle and an unopened bottle of 30 stashed in my bedroom, so hed be happy for a while. Besides, we were almost done. I was almost done.

My surgeon said the next part would probably kill me. I agreed. He got to work. The pills didnt do much to dull the pain this time. The feeling of a saw going through a femur right near the hipbone is a hard thing to describe. Even harder is the sensation one experiences the moment ones femoral artery is severed. Its like the world starts melting and going gray at the same time. Luckily, my surgeon had the torch ready and seared the gushing artery shut before finishing the amputation. When dropped the saw, the first thing I did was try to wiggle my toes. It felt like I was wiggling them just fine. Strange. I threw down another few antibiotics and painkillers.

Before the surgeon left, I demanded that he help me to the bathroom scale. It was hard to balance on one leg and get a proper reading on the scale, but when it finally registered, I was triumphant. 68lbs. The dizziness came back quickly and I yelled to the surgeon who was about to leave. We were going to finish this. It didnt take long for him to agree to take off my other leg in exchange for more pills. Cut cut, burn burn. He carried me back to the scale where I teetered on my lopsided stumps. 59lbs. Then he brought me to my bed. 

So here I am. My right arm works fine; I dont think I want to get rid of that. Its probably the only part of me I find useful these days. I figure I have another couple weeks of antibiotics left. Theyre next to me under the pillow. I tucked my severed legs under the comforter. Over the next few days, Ill nip at them whenever Im hungry. My guess is the hunger pains will become less intense once my body realizes it doesnt have as much to fuel. Until then, Ill just keep taking little bites. Minimal intake, just like Im used to. Just like what keeps me comfortably in control.

<TEXT> Jen and I love Halloween. We go all-out when decorating our house and yard. The neighborhood kids love to see what we put up every year and even their parents are impressed by the scale and sophistication of the decorations we use. We dont just give out candy, we invite the trick-or-treaters into our home to see our setup. Pumpkins, spiders, skeletons, ghosts - you name it, weve got it. Our local newspaper even did a feature on us last year. A Safe and Spooky Spot for Local Kids. It wasnt much more than a fluff piece, but it felt good to have our work celebrated.

A project Jens been working on over the last fifteen or so years is her Halloween Town of Horrors. Its the centerpiece of our trick-or-treat trip around the house. The town takes up our whole dining room table and its a darker take on those big Christmas villages people like put out in December. The architecture is very Tim Burton-esque; lots of strange looking buildings, exaggerated colors, and blood splatters, while the townsfolk lurk in the shadows like little purple zombies and space aliens. As the years have gone by, Jens taken her Halloween town from a couple small buildings to the sprawling, populous nightmare-scape it is today.

This year, Halloween came and went. We had a blast. Jens Halloween town was a huge hit. Even adults from around the neighborhood came over to take a look. Jen loved the attention; she wanted to be an artist growing up, but, sadly, it wouldnt pay the bills. As we cleaned the house, Jen picked up one of the townsfolk dolls. Its clothing had a little tear that needed to be fixed. Sighing good-naturedly, she gathered the rest of them into their box. I love those dolls; their aesthetic works beautifully with the town Jen puts them in. They range in size from a raisin to a lemon; some have distinguishable features, others dont. It takes a while for her to make each one - between 2 and 5 months - but her effort always yields a product thats perfect for Halloween. Until she can carry one to term, we both agree they shouldnt go to waste. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They told me when I was pretty young that Id never be able to have a baby. And that was that. No therapy, no consolation, no nothing. I was given the knowledge and left to my own devices to deal with it. They wouldnt have to see me crying at night. Every night. For years and years. I kept it all under wraps, despite hating myself inside. Hating my failure. Hating my parts that didnt work. Hating the jealousy I felt for the women who had that gift and squandered it. I needed to try something. Anything.

It didnt take long before I was ordering fertility drugs online. Clomiphene. GnRH. Diethylstilbestrol. I took them all. Then I had to get sperm. That wasnt too difficult to obtain. A quick few ads on Craigslist, a couple pictures sent back and forth, and a meet up. An hour later, Id have a condom full of what I needed.

I gave the drugs a week to kick in before doing anything else. They made me dizzy and nauseous. Small price to pay, I guess. For the next part, I had to inject the sperm into myself. I had to try lots of spots; I was aiming for where I thought ovaries would be. I figured an ectopic pregnancy was still a pregnancy. And maybe the doctors could fix it if I was lucky enough to encounter that problem in the first place. 

The needles were long and fat and the contents were cold from the refrigerator. In that week, Id been with 30 men. My body ached and my self-esteem was gone, but theyd given me what I required. I injected myself with all of it over the course of the day. My belly was a hole-filled, leaky wreck by the time I was done. And the medication had me dizzier than Id ever been. Its even hard to type this out through the brain fog. But its all going to be worth it when this works. When this works, Im going to have a beautiful baby of my own. One who will be loved. One who wont be told he cant follow his dreams just because hes a boy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *June 29, 2015*

Bills been complaining about the cut on his leg. He wont go to the doctor and I dont blame him. He doesnt need a smug college boy in a white coat telling him he cant be working on the house at his age. Back in my day, I remember mom telling us that fly babies ate up all the bad skin and whatnot from a cut thats gone bad. Ill see what Bills got to say about it later.

*June 30, 2015*

Didnt take too long to get Bill on board. Hes always told me Im the smart one of the family. I got him sitting out on the porch with his leg propped up on a stool. That cuts a nasty thing. Goes from the little joint under his knee all the way around to that tendon in his heel. Bills a toughy, though. Hardly complains at all, thanks to the bourbon. I guess we just have to wait and see if those flies will come do their thing.

*July 1, 2015*

What a scorcher today. Bills sweating up a storm and his leg looks bad. A couple flies landed on it but then took right off so I took a little molasses and rubbed it around the cut. And you know what? That did the trick! Before we knew it, there were ten or so of the little guys on the cut at a time. Bill told me they tickled but I told him to man up and let them make their babies in peace. He did.

*July 2, 2015*

Im glad Bill chose to sleep in the chair on the porch. We didnt want to disturb any of the progress we were making. When I looked at the cut in the morning, it was real red. Lots redder than the day before. I told him that meant it was healing. He nodded and had some breakfast bourbon. In the afternoon we started to see some white gunk leaking out of the cut. It smelled pretty bad. From what I remember mom telling me, that always happens before it starts getting better. Bill was glad to hear it.

*July 3, 2015*

Boy oh boy does Bills leg stink. I think he might be running a little fever, too. A fevers the bodys way of fighting an infection, so its good hes got his own body working with the fly babies. Speaking of those, we can see the little buggers wiggling inside that cut. Theyre real small but theyre definitely there. I make fun of Bill and call him a momma and he tells me to shut up and we laugh. I made sure to make him an extra big dinner so he could have his strength and keep fighting the good fight. 

*July 4, 2015*

Happy Independence Day! Wish it was a happier one for Bill. He had a real hard time getting to the restroom with his leg as swollen as its gotten. He left a trail of those white worms as he walked. I asked if he was Hansel or Gretel. He didnt get it. I shouldnt poke fun at the poor man. But it doesnt feel like his fever has gotten much higher so weve got that going for us. Tomorrow Im going to peek around inside the cut. Better get Bill some extra bourbon because its gonna hurt.

*July 5, 2015*

My poor Bill had a bad fall in the middle of the night when he had get up to go pee. I didnt even hear him and only found out in the morning when I saw some blood and fly babies on the floor near the bathroom. Well, that, and he wouldnt get out of bed. Took some convincing for me to get him to show me what he hurt. That tendon in his heel that was already a little cut up just snapped and rolled up like a window shade. He couldnt move his foot at all and had to hop all the way back. Dont know what it says about me that I couldnt hear him hopping and grunting. Guess Im getting old.

*July 6, 2015*

I got Bills leg all splinted up as best I could. He really hooted and hollered when I tried to pull that tendon back into place. We agreed I should just give up and let it heal on its own. Some good news, though - the fly babies are looking great. There might be a thousand of the little guys in there and some even grew up and started laying their own eggs. The itching is bothering Bill real bad and he said hes got a hell of a sore throat. Im trying to make all his favorite dinners to help keep his mind off it.

*July 7, 2015*

Bills leg is swollen up real bad and the sheets on the bed are starting to get wet with whatevers coming out of the cut. Doesnt smell right either. I took as many of the fly babies out as I could reach and poured some rubbing alcohol in the cut. Boy I thought he hollered yesterday! I thought hed break all the kitchen china all the way from the bedroom with the way he yelled. Hes got some bad lumps on the sides of his neck. On top of all this, my poor Bills gotta deal with a cold. When it rains, it pours, I guess.

*July 8, 2015*

Bills fever is high. I asked if he wanted me to call the doctor and he would have none of it. I feel stupid for asking.

*July 9, 2015*

The smell coming off Bills leg woke me up at sunrise. I opened up all the windows and tried to air the place out. It was hard for Bill to wake up. Hes fighting that cold with everything hes got. Hes always been a fighter. A little cut and a cold wont keep my man down. Theres a lot of flies in the house lately. I figure theyre from the babies in his leg. To be honest, theyre just becoming part of the background. Ambiance, I think they call it. 

*July 14, 2015*

I havent written for a while because Bill passed away the other night. It mustve been his heart. Id been worrying about how his ticker would hold up against all the other stuff. Wasnt an issue for years, though. I guess it doesnt matter. I still go to bed with him every night. I dont want him to be alone anymore than hed want me to be. Plus, and I know Im a big weirdo for thinking this, but I dont want all those baby flies to be without their momma. Bill didnt like being called that, but we both knew it was true. The little babies are all over his mouth and nose and eyes. Maybe other spots too but I dont want to look and make Bill blush. The girls in heavenll make fun of him for a while if they saw him blush. No, Im content with watching him the way he is. Big Momma Bill. You know, I always wanted to be a grandma.

<TEXT> I feel happiness. Elation. Old Me experienced misery. He was stationary, stagnant, and sad; a shuffling personification of malaise. But Old Me ended earlier today. Peer into my eyes and watch as hes devoured.

In the late afternoon afternoon, I strolled through our small-town markets and malls, restaurants and theaters, touching all I could. Its amazing how oblivious people can be. Back home, a few hours later, local news reports started coming in.

Biological Mystery. Impossible Pregnancies. Plague.

Each headline fed my reinforcement mechanisms. Elation begat ebullience. Ebullience begat euphoria. I am the Infestor of Wombs.

I wandered, undetected, through blockades and cordons and walls. When I chose to be seen, they flocked to me; women walked, girls skipped, infants crawled. Old Me peeked out from behind my eyes, only to retreat, sobbing.

Gravid bellies seethed from the impatience of the lives-to-be and threatened to tear their mothers in half. I walked from home to home, invisible again, stroking the hair and skin of my surrogates, watching them smile contentedly during this brief respite from pain. Soon after, they all gave birth.

Scores Dead. Devastating Deliveries. Stillbirth Epidemic.


My Little Girl crawled to my home as I slept and was waiting on my doorstep the next morning. I bathed Her tiny body and removed the remainder of Her umbilical cord. She stared at me with Her radiant eyes as I poured warm water over Her skin. Extinguish the stars, She whispered, smiling. I kissed the top of her head. I am the Father of Joy.

Joy grew as I fed Her throughout the day. Old Me was nearly gone; his presence only manifested as prickles down my spine as Joy raced through Her childhood and adolescence and peaked as a young woman over a period of hours. Joy told me She was ready and I followed Her into the basement.

She stood in the center of the dirt floor, beaming at me with adoration. I am the Gaze of Beasts, She breathed. I heard a ripping sound as the corners of Her mouth tore to Her ears. Her teeth cracked and splintered and fell to the floor. Fingernails peeled off and fluttered to the ground like dead moths. Old Me shuddered and exhaled his dying breath. Joy was still for a moment, but then She began to change. I watched in awe as Her flesh sagged and split and the pores of Her skin gave birth to the eyes of Black God. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *The following excerpt has been released by Wikileaks following over a year of refusals by the United States Government to provide answers about the US military action in the town of Clearview, Maryland. The action is reported to have killed nearly 400 people, all US citizens or legal immigrants. This attack was unprecedented, illegal, and has been vehemently denied, despite overwhelming evidence of a massacre. It is hoped that this bit of information can bring to light some of what occurred in Clearview and help end the mystery of the attack on US citizens by their own government.*

**January 9, 2016**

I feel happiness. Elation. Old Me experienced misery. He was stationary, stagnant, and sad; a shuffling personification of malaise. But Old Me ended earlier today. Peer into my eyes and watch as hes devoured. 

In the late afternoon afternoon, I strolled through our small-town markets and malls, restaurants and theaters, touching all I could. Its amazing how oblivious people can be. Back home, a few hours later, local news reports started coming in. 

Biological Mystery. Impossible Pregnancies. Plague. 

Each headline fed my reinforcement mechanisms. Elation begat ebullience. Ebullience begat euphoria. I am the Infestor of Wombs.

I wandered, undetected, through blockades and cordons and walls. When I chose to be seen, they flocked to me; women walked, girls skipped, infants crawled. Old Me peeked out from behind my eyes, only to retreat, sobbing.

Gravid bellies seethed from the impatience of the lives-to-be and threatened to tear their mothers in half. I walked from home to home, invisible again, stroking the hair and skin of my surrogates, watching them smile contentedly during this brief respite from pain. Soon after, they all gave birth.

Scores Dead. Devastating Deliveries. Stillbirth Epidemic.

**January 10, 2016**

My Little Girl crawled to my home as I slept and was waiting on my doorstep the next morning. I bathed Her tiny body and removed the remainder of Her umbilical cord. She stared at me with Her radiant eyes as I poured warm water over Her skin. Extinguish the stars, She whispered, smiling. I kissed the top of her head. I am the Father of Joy.

Joy grew as I fed Her throughout the day. Old Me was nearly gone; his presence only manifested as prickles down my spine as Joy raced through Her childhood and adolescence and peaked as a young woman over a period of hours. Joy told me She was ready and I followed Her into the basement.

She stood in the center of the dirt floor, beaming at me with adoration. I am the Gaze of Beasts, She breathed. I heard a ripping sound as the corners of Her mouth tore to Her ears. One by one, Her teeth dropped to the floor. Fingernails peeled off and fluttered to the ground like dead dragonflies. Old Me shuddered and exhaled his dying breath. Joy was still for a moment, but then She began to change. I watched in awe as Her flesh sagged and split and the pores of Her skin gave birth to the eyes of Black God.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My therapist suggested I write this out. I guess reliving that night and putting my experiences on paper will help me get over the trauma. 

A few years ago, I was in a motorcycle wreck. Broke my left tibia and fibula, shattered my right patella, got a greenstick fracture of my left femur, multiple fractures in my pelvis, breaks in almost all my ribs, and two broken collarbones. I was immobilized from the shoulders down by a heavy body cast. They told me I was lucky.

My wife, Violet, was supportive and nurturing. She never once complained about having to care for me. She cooked all my meals, kept me company, and emptied my bedpan without grimacing. About two weeks into my convalescence, Jenna called us, bawling, because her college roommate died. Vi had to leave immediately and be there for her. Vis sister, Kathy, was going to take care of me.

When I woke up the following morning, Vi was off to get Jenna. Kathy was there, cheerfully making breakfast and talking up a storm as she helped me with my more embarrassing biological needs. Like her sister, she never made me feel ashamed. She left around 11 that night and told me shed be back at dawn. 

I like to sleep with the TV on. For some reason, I find it comforting. Id drifted off while the game was finishing and only woke up when I felt something thud against the cast on my chest. In the flickering light of the television, I saw a huntsman spider staring back at me. She was bigger than most of the ones Id seen around here; maybe the length of a rugby ball. My breath caught in my throat and every muscle in my body fired in an attempt to push the thing off me. I couldnt move. 

I started yelling at the spider, hoping it might scare her away. She wasnt frightened. She turned around, exposing her abdomen to me, and I gasped. Her back and belly were covered in babies. They rippled like windblown fur as they moved over their mothers body. The huntsman turned back toward me and walked closer to my face.

Before then, Id never thought about spiders having a scent. This one did. It smelled like wet dirt, sort of like how outside smells after a rainstorm. The smell intensified as its long legs reached my face. I squeezed my mouth and eyes shut. Its prickly legs advanced, first to my lower lip, then my nose, my eyelids, and finally my forehead. Its leg-span stretched from ear-to-ear, hairline to chin. Its thick, heavy body ran from my chin to right between my eyes. And it stayed there.

I tried to hold my breath. To say I was horrified was an understatement. I wished I was dead. I prayed to be dead. My prayers went unanswered as it walked a little higher, letting its abdomen brush against my nose.

I sneezed.

The huntsman immediately buried its fangs into my forehead as her babies streamed from her abdomen onto my face. I shrieked. Tiny spiders crawled over my cheeks, squirmed through my beard, and hid in my eyelashes. I thrashed my head back and forth in an attempt to get them off me. The mother moved onto the pillow by my right ear and bit my cheek. It felt like a wasp sting. Then she ran over my shoulder and pushed herself through the tiny opening of the cast by my armpit.

At this point, I was screaming uncontrollably. A sea of baby arachnids explored my nostrils, hair, and were starting to find my ears. I felt a tendon or ligament or something snap as I thrashed, sending white-hot pain through my neck. Trying to move my head after that was excruciating. 

As the babies dispersed throughout my face and head, the mother explored under the cast. To this day, I have no idea how she was able to compress herself to fit underneath the thing. She wandered over my chest to my stomach and down to my groin. She exited the cast by the hole nearby, only to move back inside by my legs. She stopped at the underside of my knee. And thats where she stayed.

When Kathy arrived in the morning, Id somehow fallen asleep. I guess the exhaustion brought on by the horror Id experienced forced my body to shut down even though my mind was still soaked in terror. Oblivious to the events of the night before, Kathy shook me awake. I started screaming again. I felt the huntsman behind my knee. She mustve been sleeping, too, and was startled awake by my yelling. She bit my leg over and over as Kathy tried to calm me down and tried to get me to fill her in on what was happening.

By the time I was able to tell her, she looked like she was about to faint. Id always considered myself somewhat of an arachnophobe, but Kathys fear of them was light years beyond my own. She called emergency services, and they sent a couple guys who were able to coax the thing out and kill her. In the end, it was anticlimactic. 

Vi came home with Jenna later in the day and Kathy and I told her about my night. Neither of them were able to listen to the details. A family of arachnophobes. Time went by and my broken bones knitted together and healed, and eventually I was back on my motorcycle. Every night, though, I dream about the huntsman staring at me. I feel her young streaming across my face and up my nose and around the gaps of my teeth. Whenever theres a quiet moment, I hear them scratching at my eardrums, and Id swear that every time I clean my ears, Im pulling out eggs.

<DATE> 2015-10-18 01:34:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This happened early Monday morning. I rarely have erotic dreams anymore. I used to have them a lot when I was 15 or so, but 20 years later I'm usually dreaming about food or flying or something. However, during that brief, pre-dawn moment, I was 15 again.

All I remember is that I was performing oral sex on a beautiful woman. The hottest aspect of the dream was how she smelled. It was so intense and animalistic; never before had I experienced such a pheromonal head-rush from a dream alone.

Toward the end of the dream, I remember I was rubbing my hand against her crotch over and over and then sniffing it. It was then I woke up and realized what I'd been doing: I had been rubbing the area between my balls and my legs with my hands and then sniffing them as I dreamed.

TL;DR: I should shower before bed. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Norman gazed across the structureless void; a formless vacuum of unbounded cosmic nothingness. He looked down at his watch. It was far too dark to see the position of its hands. Sighing, Norman pressed the button to illuminate its face. Blackness, still.

Norman drifted for countless subjective eons, his frustration growing. The Indiglo button on his watch had long since eroded away under the cumulative stress of unquantifiable presses. He remembered how the watch face looked when lit up: bright, welcoming. Informative. But now it was gone.

He put the watch to his ear. It still ticked. With his arm back at his side, he realized he could still hear the faint ticking. There was no other sound. The steady ticking persisted without end for another colossal epoch. During that period, Norman began to devise his own sense of time. It worked. Finally, he could start planning.

Norman floated along. He couldnt tell if he was moving at incredible speed through billions of spatial dimensions or simply stuck, motionless, in zero. It didnt matter. As the watch ticked in the void, he plotted and schemed.

The void felt different to Norman when he was ready to put his plan into action. It appeared the same, but the sensation he perceived was no longer one of emptiness, but one of ripeness - of gravidity. The feeling gave him hope; the hope all great minds have when their creations are to be unveiled.

Norman embraced the void from all sides. He felt it rush in to fill him; an avalanche of nothingness somehow given shape and weight and form through his perception of it alone. It was then, he knew, he could manipulate this cosmos of nothingness. It was now his clay, and he was the sculptor.

Power flowed through Norman as he sculpted nothingness into form. Always on the verge of being overwhelmed, but somehow managing to hold on, Norman wept with joy. Through his tears, through the sobs which convulsed through his body, Norman closed his eyes and whispered, Let there be light. The power of the void left him, and all was still. 

Norman gazed across the structureless void; a formless vacuum of unbounded cosmic nothingness. He looked down at his watch. It was far too dark to see the position of its hands. Sighing, Norman pressed the button to illuminate its face. And there was light. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What He Told Me </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-12 19:17:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We knew there was something wrong with him. Something about the way he was sitting. Wed given him a wide berth; the smell alone warranted that. But beyond that, there was a disconcerting amount of tension in the man. I knew I wasnt the only one worried about the potential for violence he signaled. 

Peristaltic ripples of dread pulsed through my gut when the train slowed to a crawl. Another service outage. The train stopped completely, accompanied by the automated message indicating a technical issue and an assurance that we would be moving again soon. At least the lights stayed on this time.

Nervous smalltalk ebbed and flowed. Wed stopped in a bad place. The emergency exits were unobstructed, but they led to a cement wall. The tunnel was excruciatingly narrow and felt claustrophobic, even within the relative roominess of our subway car. We were in the first car of the train. At the front was the locked compartment housing the conductor and her controls, and the rear led to small gap separating our car from the next one in line. The man sat in the corner seats closest to that exit.

We grew quiet as the mans breathing became loud enough to hear over the din of conversation. Sweat poured off bald head and neck and disappeared into the fabric of his heavy woolen coat. The bituminous matte of his skin was in stark contrast with the high-gloss white wall behind him. He looked like a shadow. We all stared at him.

A collective groan rose from the passengers when he stood up and dropped his coat on the floor. He stood in place, starting at the wall. He was naked - his body a frightening combination of scar tissue and slabs of muscle. The nauseating scent of ammonia washed across the train car like a chemical spill. My eyes teared up and I was at least twenty feet away. I couldnt imagine how bad it was for those half that distance. I saw people take cell phones out of their pockets, presumably to call 911, but none of them had success. I figured we were in a tunnel under the river. No service. Everyone backed away as far as they were able while still trying to respect the personal space of those around them. I fumbled around in my purse for a minute and felt a bit of relief for the first time since boarding the train. To say I was grateful for my sisters gift of a little keychain pepper spray was an understatement.

The relief didnt last. The people nearest the man were the first to cry out when he bent down to pull a knife from his discarded coat. Now we began to panic. There was nowhere we could go. Within ten seconds of seeing the knife, those closest to the emergency exit windows had pulled them from their panes only to realize there was about six inches of clearance between the car and the wall. 

The parts I want most to forget are those I remember with the greatest clarity. 

His knife was short and thick. Probably four or five inches long with a wooden handle. It didnt look particularly sharp. It cut well, though, as we all saw, when he sat back down and started carving into the skin on his legs. Everyone was yelling or screaming or shouting. Some yelled at the man, who didnt even look up, while others simply expressed their horror in whichever way suited their individual personality. I caught myself repeating, oh fuck, oh fuck, with progressively-increasing volume before I noticed a little boy next to me whose expression begged for the sight of a calm and collected adult who could tell him things were going to be okay.

Then someone tried to be a hero. A guy in baggy khakis and a sleeveless t-shirt. He approached the man, bobbing and weaving like a boxer. When he went for the knife, the man grabbed his shirt with freakish power and pulled him to the floor. I saw the hero hit his head hard on the handrail on the way down. Dazed, he struggled to get up. The man pushed the knife into the back of the heros neck. He didnt move after that.

Now my fellow passengers were on the verge of hysteria. Some of the bigger guys were pounding on the door of the conductors cabin and yelling at her to open up. She was yelling something back but I dont know what. When I redirected my attention to the crazy man, who Id only taken my eyes off for about five seconds, he was standing again. Long strips of black flesh hung from his thighs. Hed sliced strips from his groin to his knees, exposing the muscles underneath. In slow motion, I watched them twitch as he advanced toward us.

The first person he grabbed was a middle-aged woman. His large left hand grabbed her lower jaw; thumb under her chin and fingers in her mouth. She shrieked around his fingers in a higher pitch than anyone else in the car. She bit down. I remember how his blood darkened her teeth and dribbled out of her mouth. He didnt flinch. He adjusted her neck so she was staring into his eyes. He stared for a few seconds. Then he swung the knife into the top of her head, killing her instantly. He let her drop to the floor, her teeth still clamped around his fingers, tearing off the skin as she fell.

Two more women died the same way. In our panic, wed begun pushing and shoving one another to get away from the man. None of us were brave enough to run by him and try to get to the other car. The stronger ones of us were the victors here, pushing the smaller, weaker passengers at the man as they worked to get further from him.

A tall, heavy businessman stood between me and the murderer. I knew what was coming. I braced myself to no avail. He picked me up and threw me at the man, my 100 pound frame being no obstacle in the businessmans quest to run away.

The man grabbed me before I could crash to the ground in front of him. I closed my eyes and screamed, knowing I was about to die. I felt him wrench my chin and jaw and I vomited around his gore-caked fingers as they pushed down my throat. I waited for the knife to fall.

But it didnt. His breath, humid with putrescence, replaced the omnipresent odor of ammonia. My eyes opened to the sight of his face a mere six inches from my own. He stared at me with a rapt intensity Id only seen from cats about to pounce on their prey. I struggled against his grip, but he was incomprehensibly strong. I scratched and kicked at him, aiming my blows at his face and groin. He still held on.

The next thing I knew, I was on the floor. His left hand still remained in my mouth while I felt his right pushing up my skirt and tearing my underwear off with one violent pull. Then he was inside me. I screamed in protest and agony only to hear the sounds gurgle around his long fingers lodged in my throat. I prayed for him to kill me. Every thrust of his hips made me feel like my bones were shattering under his weight. After a while, I gave up struggling. I stared into his eyes and sobbed as he gazed at me. Then he was done.  

He slowly pulled his fingers out of my mouth, causing me to choke and cough. His entire weight was on top of me. The screaming in the background was just white noise at that point. I gasped, trying to fill my lungs under the pressure of his mass. When he rose up on his knees and raised his blade, I knew the sweet, unobstructed breath I took would be my last. Again, though, I was wrong. He sliced through the carotid artery on the right side of his neck. Hot blood splashed onto my face and puddled inside my gasping mouth. Letting the knife fall to the floor, his enormous hands moved up and grasped my head. 

The last things I ever saw were his long, chipped thumbnails pushing in toward my eyes. In the blinding whiteness that followed - in the piercing silence that overtook the cacophony of screams, one clear voice broke through. Extinguish the stars, it told me. I drifted into a void of unconsciousness.

My coma lasted for seven months. Im in the hospital. Blind. Dictating my story into a word processor. The last couple weeks of being awake have been terrifying; every sound I hear still causes me to spin my head and try to look at the source. Im still not admitting to myself that those days are over. 

What the man said to me resonates throughout every waking moment of my new life. I try to pick it apart in my head in a vain attempt to find some meaning in it. Of course, theres nothing. Extinguish the stars, I murmur to myself, running my trembling hands over my belly. As if in response, I feel the baby kick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Iia stared at his laptop screen with disbelief. Five hundred readers. Five. Hundred. He sat back. The smile on his face was one of pride, but, internally, he worried. What do I do next?, he asked himself. Ive done it all; leg gum, the eye fairy, Melanie, Maude, things up cocks, things left to congeal, but what can I do thats new?

Grumbling under his breath, Iia stood up from the couch and walked over to the kitchen. Hed just been to the store. Whole Foods. Pricey, yes, but conveniently nearby. He opened the refrigerator. Many components and potential food items, but nothing snackable. The clock on the stove read 5:01. His girlfriend wouldnt be home until late. Long after dinner. He wondered what he could do to fill all that time. 

With a groan, Iia hauled the 15 cast iron pan from the cabinet beneath the granite countertop. He was sore. Leg day was only two days ago, plus hed reaggravated an old hip injury. He felt as if two decades had been added to his three. Bro, do you even lift?, he joked to himself, as he plopped the pan onto the stovetop and turned the flame to medium-high.

As the pan heated, Iia freed a package of spicy Italian sausage from the confines of their natural casings. They were from a local company and had quickly become his favorite. Lots of fennel. 

He crumbled the sausage meat into small, coin-sized chunks. By the time he was done, the pan was hot and ready. He drizzled a small amount of extra-virgin olive oil onto the iron surface and immediately followed it with the sausage. The sizzling sound was a pleasant harbinger of the porcine aroma that would soon follow. As the fat rendered, he began chopping some garlic. About four cloves. He liked to make them thin; a larger surface area meant more flavor got infused into the end product. 

Time passed as Iia stirred the sausage around, making sure it was golden brown and delicious. Once that critical status was achieved, he removed about 95% of the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon. The remaining pieces spat and sizzled in the fat left by their colleagues. Iia cranked the heat to high. The blue flame under the pan grew like a gravitationally-contained supernova. The sizzling sound increased. 

Reaching over, Iia plucked the tube of tomato paste from the countertop. He squeezed in about four tablespoons of the scarlet substance and stirred rapidly, gritting his teeth as oil splattered on his bare forearm. As the paste browned, he threw in the little medallions of chopped garlic. The timing of this part was crucial: the remaining sausage in the pan was about a minute from burning. The tomato paste would be charred in less than twenty seconds. The garlic had to get cooked in that time period.

Iia watched the garlic slices with the rapt intensity of an epidemiologist working to identify an infection vector. With only seconds to spare, he emptied half a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc into the pan. Steam exploded from the surface, followed by a bright flame. Iia was prepared for this. He calmly covered the pan and watched as the flame quickly died out. Uncovering it, he stirred the mixture, making sure to scrape all the bits of sausage and caramelized tomato paste from the bottom of the pan. Once he was satisfied with the deglazing, he reincorporated the sausage meat hed put aside.

By now, the concoction was finally starting to look like a sauce. It would still have to reduce for about forty minutes on low heat, though. And that was fine. There was still one major part to work on.

One other item Iia had purchased from the store was a small plastic package of heirloom grape tomatoes. They were beautiful; yellow, red, orange, and purple. His favorites. With great care and a very sharp knife, he halved the lycopersicum gems and arranged them, cut-side up, on a baking sheet. They were then drizzled with extra virgin olive oil, coarse sea salt, cracked black pepper, and a chiffonade of basil fresh from his cousins garden. All this time, the oven had been preheating to 400 degrees. It was ready for the tomatoes to be deep inside.

Iia pushed the baking sheet into the hot body of the oven. It accepted it without complaint. He set a timer for 25 minutes. Now, the only thing left to do was get a pot ready for the pasta.

Growing up in an Italian-American family, Iia had particular love for pasta. All kinds, really. This dish, however, called for something special. Something with a good chew that could hold up against the firmness of the fennel-packed sausage. And that pasta was cavatelli. 

Iia brought a pot of water to a rolling boil. The timer had just gone off and the roasted tomatoes were resting on the unoccupied burner space next to the still-reducing, but nearly-finished, sauce. He salted the water generously; hed always had the best results when the water was as salty as the Mediterranean. Into the water went the cavatelli. Theyd only take a couple minutes. 

He watched as the little pieces bobbed in the turbulence of the cooking process. Once they floated to the top, he moved them directly into the cast iron pot housing the sausage sauce. Iia turned up the heat on the sauce again. It was now thick, the wine having reduced and emulsified with the rendered sausage fat. He stirred the pasta and sauce gently, letting the cavatelli soak up as much of the liquid as possible. He poured in half a ladle-full of the water from the pasta pot; the salty, starchy fluid would help flavor and bind the sauce to the cavatelli.

Satisfied with the cooking process, Iia added the roasted grape tomatoes. Their bright, sweet acidity would be a perfect compliment to the fatty unctuousness of the sausage sauce. He stirred them in gently so they didnt break. 

Iia took his favorite pasta bowl from the cabinet on the left of the sink. It was a pale gray-blue. It reminded him of the ocean on a cloudy day. A few scoops of the pasta went in. He took a fork and brought his dinner to the couch. He refreshed his subreddit. Still five hundred subscribers. No one had left as he cooked. No one came to the conclusion he was a weirdo hack in that period of time. That had to mean something.

He chewed the pasta with satisfaction. It was delicious. Some of the best hed made in a long time. It took him about ten minutes to finish the bowl. By then, he was getting full. He glanced at the television. The Pioneer Woman was just starting. Perfect. With a contented sigh, he put down his fork. As he watched Ree Drummond, he thought about his future. His future as a student. As a writer. As a life partner. The last one made him so happy. Theyd recently been talking about getting a kitten. A fluffy gray one with little ears. Her name would be Hugs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife lost her battle with bone cancer a year ago. I have no one. 

Ive worked from home for the last six months. My employer has been sympathetic and accommodating after everything that happened. Too many workplaces neglect and end up getting rid of disabled employees. I guess I should feel valued. 

Breakfast was mac and cheese left over from the night before. I hadnt made enough for my breakfast to be even remotely satisfying. Stock prices and quantitative analytics spilled from my computer monitors as I tried to concentrate on work. My eyes kept drifting over to the picture of me and Brynn on our wedding day. I have no attention span when Im hungry.

I groaned as I lifted myself into a standing position. My knees were shot. I made my way over to the kitchen pantry and got a bag of chips and a bottle of soda. Coughing as I trundled across the office over to my desk, Id already opened the chips and was pushing them into my mouth. As I walked by and saw my reflection in the glossy murk of my hibernating television, I could swear I saw Brynn standing by my side. When I blinked, she was gone. Just like a year ago.

By lunchtime I was just finishing the chips and the bottle of soda. I was ravenous. My concentration had improved somewhat as I ate, and I made a few good trades that got my company some cash and me a nice commission or two. But it was noon. The market volume was drying up as everyone went to lunch. Id start working again around two and go hard until closing bell. Until then, I had to eat something. Anything.

The pizza delivery guy always brings me extra stuff because Im a generous tipper. At this point in my career, I earn more money than I know what to do with, so why not spread it around? I ordered two large Sicilian pizzas, some mozzarella sticks, garlic knots, and chicken alfredo. The delivery guy brought me a pint of ice cream and a cannoli. He got a $100 tip. I think my interaction with him is some of the only person-to-person contact I have nowadays.

I sat in front of the TV as I ate. I didnt bother to turn it on. When I looked up after finishing my first pizza, Brynns reflection was watching me. Her body was distorted by the curved surface of the television. She was shorter. Heavier looking. Compressed. She moved her arms as if to embrace me. I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to regain my composure. I had to be hallucinating.

The lids of my eyes lifted to the sight of her face inches from mine. My scream reverberated throughout my cavernous office space. Before Id finished my yell, shed wrapped her arms around me and nestled her head against my shoulder. Everything went white.

All I can remember from that moment was blissful warmth and closeness. I can only describe it as reexperiencing the minute I knew I was in love with her, along with all the associated tactile sensations of the most intimate embrace Id ever felt. The experience couldnt have lasted more than two seconds.

When it was over, it was as if every organ had been ripped from my body and Id been left to exsanguinate on the floor. A feeling of overwhelming emptiness swept over me like an atomic inferno. My mourning period following Brynns death was nothing compared to this. I was a bottomless pit of despair and loneliness.

The expanse of my lunch was still spread in front of me. Mindlessly, I began eating. Every swallow felt like an eyedropper of water attempting to refill an evaporated oceanscape. But it was progress. I ate until nothing was left. My stomach ached, protesting the amount of food it had been forced to accommodate in such a short period of time. But the hunger remained. The emptiness remained. And it taunted me.

I tried to get on with my day. Work was out of the question. There wasnt much food in my house, so Id started drinking soda. I definitely had enough of that. One of my closets had countless three-liter bottles of the generic brand I preferred over the popular ones. Id gone through two of them before I started feeling lightheaded. I couldnt begin to imagine what this was doing to my already-unhealthy blood sugar. That was the least of my concerns. 

Around 8pm I walked out of my house for the first time in almost a month. Everything had been delivered to me over that period of time. Hoping there was still gas in my X5, I clambered up into the drivers seat. I was shocked at how much bigger Id gotten since I last drove and felt my only moment of relief all day when I discovered the seat could go back another few inches. The car started with no effort and I began driving to the store. I was in no condition to drive. My vision kept blurring and despite the tremendous pain of emptiness I felt, I desperately wanted to go to sleep. I managed to keep my composure, however, and made it to my destination.

Even with the handicap tags on my truck, the short walk from it to the store felt like torture. I was wheezing by the time Id taken my cart and started pushing it around the front of the store. There was no way Id use one of the motorized scooters they provide. I dont have much pride left, but I still have enough to keep walking until I simply cant anymore. 

I bought whatever was closest to the doors and the cash registers. I didnt care what. I had a bagboy help me load up my car with the three carriages-worth of food Id purchased. The gratitude I felt for him and his colleague as they pushed and emptied the carts was immeasurable and I emptied my wallet of cash to thank them. I went home.

My entire trip was spent eating. When I got back I turned off the car and sat in the dark, illuminated only by the dim light of my garage. I frantically worked to tear away wrapping and packaging. Sleeves of crackers disappeared down my throat. Partially-frozen TV dinners of meatloaf and mashed potatoes followed. I sobbed as I pushed it all into my mouth, hacking and coughing crumbs onto my steering wheel and dashboard. Only when my stomach pain was nearly unbearable did my feeling of emptiness dip to a level where I had the strength to get out of the garage.

It took nearly an hour to empty my car of the colossal amount of food Id purchased. I crashed onto my couch, gasping for air as stars twirled before my eyes. A few minutes later, after Id regained some semblance of wherewithal, I felt an acute pain in my right shoulder. When I reached around with my left hand to investigate, I yelped as I sliced into my index finger. Some asshole had left a juice glass on the arm of the couch and it had fallen off onto the cushion. That same asshole recently fell onto that couch without looking and shattered the glass with his shoulder.

I went into the bathroom. A familiar, morbidly-obese man greeted me in my full-length mirror. I turned to look at the damage to my shoulder. Chunks of glass were embedded in my shirt and skin underneath. Despite my disgust with myself and the pain in my shoulder and stomach and finger, I felt slightly better and less empty. Sighing, I pulled off my shirt and felt shards of glass detach from my shoulder and plink onto the ground.

The feeling of emptiness reemerged like the head of a hydra. I began to cry. I stared into the mirror at my shirtless self, watching the blood trickle from my shoulder in thin rivulets which were stopped by the absorbent waistband of my sweatpants. I wrapped my arms around my body in desperation. The cheap facsimile of an embrace only served to make me sob harder. I released the hold and started plucking the remaining glass from my shoulder. Each removed shard made the feeling of empty loneliness intensify. The feeling became overwhelming when I pulled out the last piece. I stared at the shard through my tears with curiosity. Then, without a hint of critical thought, I pushed the shard back into my shoulder. A tiny fraction of my emptiness evaporated. A fraction comparable to an entire stomach-full of food.

Time seemed to freeze as I methodically broke the larger shards of glass Id removed from my shoulder into hairpin-sized needles. I carefully plunged them into my skin. By the time Id finished with the glass, there was a semicircle of crystalline splinters decorating my upper arm. Warmth radiated out from the shards and suffused through the surrounding skin. The pain was miniscule compared to the emptiness the glass had helped eliminate. 

With more energy than Id been able to muster since my experience with my wifes apparition this afternoon, I hurried to my office to find my stapler. I assumed I was losing my mind. A healthy person doesnt see his dead wife. A healthy person doesnt ameliorate emptiness through food and glass. But what I felt was real to me. It was as real as the floor on which I stood and as real as the air filling my lungs as I gasped with the tiny pinpricks of relief I felt as each staple entered my arm. I emptied the stapler into myself, refilled it four times, and was left looking for something new to use.

I went to the garage and over to Brynns work area. She would frame pictures and paintings for her friends and family and even set up an Etsy shop before her diagnosis. Everything was right where shed left it. 

An hour went by as I pushed tiny, sharp framing nails into my other arm. These hurt much more than the glass or the staples. I arranged them in a tight, sleeve-like grid. Pain radiated throughout the limb, but I persisted. A few times, when I blinked, I saw Brynn.

Right now, its the morning after the events Ive described. I havent slept. My night was spent finding ways to fill that void inside me. Up to this point, Ive been successful. Every part of me hurts, though. Everything, from the top of my head to the bottoms of my feet, is covered; punctured and impaled in some way. Most of it is broken glass from the various glasses and china sets in the kitchen. Some of it is from my wifes old sewing box. Each of my fingertips have long pins originating right underneath the nail and terminating somewhere up toward the knuckles in my hands. Its hard to type with straight fingers. 

Im standing at my computer desk because my back and buttocks are caked with broken glass and the pain is too intense when I sit down. Even though the bottoms of my feet are equally encrusted, I have less sensation in them because of my underlying medical conditions. When I walk, I can feel the thicker and longer chunks of glass carving at the bone. 

The part I find most difficult to deal with are the series of thumbtacks in my soft palate. They are constantly causing me agonizing discomfort and they itch just as much as they hurt. I cant help but to trace my tongue around them which just draws my attention to their presence even more.

The constant, caustic undulations of searing pain are only tempered by brief, infinitesimally-soft brushes of warmth. I know its my wife trying to touch me again. But the feeling of emptiness within me is still there, albeit far less intense than yesterday. Ignoring it just makes it worse. I have to keep going, but I dont have any space left. I know what Im going to do next, and probably finally, and thats okay. 

In a few minutes, Ill be slashing open my belly and thighs and arms and stuffing them with the entire pantrys-worth of our splintered wedding china. I cant live with this feeling of emptiness. If doing this is what it takes to give me some relief and peace of mind and body, its what needs to happen. I have the knife honed and ready. As I write this, I know with 100% certainty Im not in my right mind. Ive long since stopped caring. And with that, Im going to go now. Whether or not this plan works, at the end of it all, I might have the opportunity to be with Brynn again. That's worth more than anything in this life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here's the picture that inspired it. The title was, "Had to clean up pelican vomit. Safe to assume he has stomach worms."](https://i.imgur.com/Jlqzq.jpg)

Ted had a secret he kept from those close to him. He was so worried they wouldn't understand; that they'd think him odd or ill. Luckily, in this time of great online interconnection, he could find sympathetic, or sometimes even supportive, friends. I was one of those friends.

I'm a veterinary ornithologist. Birds are my business. You got a sick bird? I'll make it a healthy bird. Sparrow or albatross, egret or jackdaw, i'll fix 'em all. After meeting a particularly ill pelican, I remembered Ted.

It seemed like I hadn't even finished hanging up the phone before I heard a frantic knock on my door. I let Ted in, and he was in prime form. By prime form, I mean he was shirtless and had a raging erection pushing out the front of his Dockers like a battering ram. Apparently he was ready.

I introduced him to the sick pelican. "Pelican, Ted. Ted, pelican." Ted curtseyed, the pelican projectile vomited. The projectile hit Ted in the chest like a peanut butter javelin and stuck to the copious hair on his torso. Ted looked down and instantly confirmed to himself that I hadn't been exaggerating.

The vomit was easily 65% worms in total mass. They writhed in their sticky confines and looped through his chest hair like eels swimming through a kelp forest. Ted gingerly plucked one from his chest and sucked the vomit from it as if removing sauce from a piece of bucatini. He growled with delight.

I stood back and watched, fascinated. The pelican, which was somehow still alive, also watched, more wormy vomit dribbling from its gullet in a steady stream. Ted was now nude. One by one, he was lining up the worms and pushing them into his urethra. Due to the upward tilt of his erection, I could see them swimming up his vas deferens before disappearing, I presume, into either his bladder or prostate. Either way, they wouldn't be getting out until he wanted them out.

Ted continued, silently. Once the worms were all out of his chest hair, he moved to the pelican. He carefully picked it up, obviously not wanting to harm the bird, and tilted it upside down and let it drain its stomach contents into his mouth. "Just like a mother bird feeding her baby," I thought. As an ornithologist, I found this to be beautiful. One species fulfilling the needs of another. Once the pelican ran dry, Ted slowly placed it back down on its makeshift nest.

Ted thanked me and left. I started to clean the floor, replaying the events in my head with curiosity and awe. "What a world we live in!" I thought. The pelican retched. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Im documenting a rough recollection of the events I helped set in motion. After that Ill try to keep track of whats going on now as long as Im able to.*

What happened after the simultaneous eruptions of Eyjafjallajkull and Kalta last month indicated what were internally calling a miscalculation of capability. Patterns were detected by satellites studying the ash trapped in the gales of the upper atmosphere. Cellular automata. Fractals. Polyhedra. Patterns which formed and collapsed at random intervals and lingered for a few seconds before transforming into something new or dissolving into windblown chaos. 

The survey drones we sent up didnt disturb the patterns when they were encountered. The shapes waxed and waned as the surveyors deployed instruments, took measurements, and beamed back data. There were strong electrical fields within the patterns. The fields were dynamic; each pattern shift was accompanied by a change in the current. Each repeated pattern had the same charge as its previous iteration with less than a nanovolt of variation.

After a few days, the ash clouds should have dissipated far more than they had. By then, the general public knew something strange was happening in the atmosphere. There were three main sectors, all in the northern Atlantic area, with high concentrations of stratospheric ash. Those areas became packed with all types of aircraft: surveyor drones, picoturbines, personal camsquitos, and every other flying device that curious people sent over to watch what was happening from their homes, offices, and labs.

On the 9th of April, the ash clouds started to descend. Over a period of about two hours, the ash moved from the stratosphere to 150 meters above the North Atlantic. The three zones then coalesced into a shapeless, dark gray mass about 300km northwest of the coast of Scotland. It remained there, motionless. 

At that point, everyone was watching. Theories bounced off claims and got synthesized into proclamations. All of them were wrong, of course, since our small research team hadnt said anything to anyone. We were afraid of what was occurring, but we were more afraid of what might happen to us if we admitted responsibility.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good afternoon, readers! My name is Rudolph Baylor. I am composing and submitting this narrative of last nights events from my, and our, friend Iias Reddit account for reasons I will momentarily reveal. For the sake of full disclosure, I must admit I am the man with whom Iia has been working. 

Now that we are on the same page, I will provide a bit of personal backstory heretofore unknown to you all. 

As I mentioned above, I am Rudolph Baylor. Im 52 years old. In what now seems like a past life, I was a day-trader who made quite a bit of money in the forex markets during the early growing-pains of the Euro adoption. Im by no means a King Midas, but Ill just say Ive been quite fortunate. 

One of the problems with making enough money in a few years to last ones lifetime is trying to fill the following years with purpose. I ended up doing what many, many people have done when searching for purpose: I trawled the Internet. Most of this trawling was to kill time. I make no effort to hide that fact. As a man uninterested in the hedonia that drives others to seek social and sexual interactions, I sought intellectual stimulation on the World Wide Web. 

Between 2002 and 2011, I read hundreds of thousands of journals, followed the rise and fall of popular online fora, and became a prolific contributor to Wikipedia. If this sounds like a boring life, you may compliment yourself on having good analytical instincts. The problem was, my options were (and are) limited. 
Some of you may have gathered, based on Iias accounts of our time together, that I have a superhuman ability to ignore pain. Unfortunately, there is nothing superhuman about it. Congenital analgesia carries great risks - not only to my physical well-being, but to my pride; not being able to feel pain means not being able to feel the pressure of my bladder or bowels. I make timed trips to the restroom every day to prevent an accident. Leaving the controlled environment of my home carries more unpredictability than I wish to endure. You can imagine how difficult my school years were; especially when the only physical sensations I seem to be able to feel involves tickling.

Ive digressed. In an effort to make this biographical tirade short, I will endeavor to get, as they say, to the point. The latter portion of my Internet research time became highly specialized as I developed a strong interest in herpetology - specifically gecko lizards. Those wishing for an explanation as to why those animals resonated so deeply within me will come away disappointed. Anyones guess is as good as mine. The best I can come up with is that it is simply a manifestation of body dysmorphia resultant from my experiences as a child with my medical condition.

My self-diagnosis of body dysmorphia led me to research the condition and seek out biographical accounts of other sufferers. The vast majority of those accounts were from victims of eating disorders, and, more recently, from transgender individuals. Very few people claimed to experience a feeling of belonging to another species. The few I did encounter, mostly on websites such as Tumblr and Reddit, labeled themselves as x-kin, with the x representing the animal with which they identified. Therefore, in the parlance of our times, I guess I am a geckokin.

Assuming Id only be happy once I at least attempted to become that which I felt so close to, I placed the Craigslist ad, met Iia, and everything went basically according to the two stories that preceded this one. 

Now, as for why this is being posted from Iias account, the answer is very simple: I followed him home, knocked him out, and have tied him to his kitchen table. 

Why am I telling you all of this? For those asking that question, good for you! From one inquisitive mind to another, I appreciate your investigative drive. Im telling you all of this to raise awareness of what happens when someone with a severe mental disturbance has no choice but to act on his urges. If I were to admit my geckokin nature to a professional, all it would lead to would be an attempt to treat my condition rather than help me embrace who I really am. I know who I am; or, at least who I will be. Its unfortunate for Iia that he needs to experience what Im certain will be a great level of discomfort, but all great leaps forward in societal progress have their casualties. On some level, Im sure he will understand.

Its fortunate that Iia doesnt have neighbors nearby. He just wont stop screaming. How he managed to find an apartment building thats in such horrendous disrepair astounds me; one would think that being one of the only tenants in a building that has 70-something apartments would be an indication to avoid signing a lease. Still, I wont pretend to understand the rationale behind his decisions. Im sure he didnt understand why I asked him to do what he did to me.

Such a busy night ahead of us! The next phase of my transformation is more dangerous than the work Iia did on me and I wouldnt trust anyone other than myself to do it. Still, I need to practice on at least one other person so I dont get it wrong and really hurt myself in the process. So far, Im working to get Iias transformation up where mine is. Id already taken out all but two of his teeth. As he said in his first story, those molars are a bitch.

I got the last one in the upper right-hand quadrant with the hammer. I warned him that his sobbing would make him aspirate some of the bone chips. Did he listen? No. In his blubbering, he inhaled a couple shards of tooth and I had to wait a half hour until he stopped coughing them up. The molar on the bottom was a wisdom tooth. Iia has a really big mouth. His wisdoms came in with room to spare. I remembered the success he had with standing on the chair and pulling mine out, so I got up on the table, grabbed the tooth with the pliers, squeezed as hard as I could, and pulled.

I must have been squeezing too hard. The pliers crunched through the tooth and gripped the root and when I pulled, only the root came out. It sounded pretty awful, a bit like crumbling a styrofoam coffee cup. Iia screamed and screamed. I used the edge of the pliers to shave down the gum line around the shattered tooth and knocked away the remaining bone. I took advantage of his wide-mouthed howling and hammered two of the same type of metal tooth-pins hed installed into my mouth yesterday. They broke through the bottom of the bleeding sockets in his gums and secured themselves deep within his jaw. I had to knock him unconscious again to do the rest.

Once the new teeth were in and Iia was coming to, staring at me in wide-eyed horror as realized he wasnt waking up from a run-of-the-mill nightmare, I realized Id forgotten the chisel to do his nose and ears. The only silverware he had was plastic. No real knives. Who doesnt have knives? I sighed in annoyance. Then I realized I had the right tools with me all along! Id been so busy focusing on my next moves that Id neglected the new teeth given to me just yesterday. 

I bit Iias nose as hard as I could. I felt the cartilage crush as the tiny needles lining my gums broke through. The pins anchoring the teeth to my jaw held, Im happy to note, and I pulled back sharply. The nose came with me. I was very surprised by how good a job I did when I estimated how far the pins needed to be to ensure proper adhesion. 

The holes in Iias face gurgled with blood as he worked to breathe through them. I knocked him out again, untied him, turned him over on his stomach, and restrained him. Ugly, flatulent sounds filled the room as the blood that had accumulated inside his sinus cavity got pushed out through the nose holes. I bit off his ears.

Now Iia and I had achieved the same level of our gecko transformation. I found two straws in his cabinet and inserted them into his nose holes. Air traveled freely through them, so I untied him, removed his clothing, turned him again onto his back, and restrained him. It was time to work on the aforementioned dangerous part of the transformation.

Geckos have cloacas. Put as simply as needed, they eliminate all their waste from one hole. I assume that the easiest way to replicate this would be to route ones urethra through the colon and allow all waste to be expelled through the anus. While this is an entirely makeshift cloaca, Im not deluded enough to believe there is a better way for me to accomplish such a thing at my nearly nonexistent level of medical knowledge.

To my dismay, upon inspecting Iia, I discovered Id overestimated the size of an adult penis. Id always known mine was larger than average and I knew that would make it easier to properly route what needed to be routed. Iias penis, however, was less than a quarter of the size of my own. It stuck out from his pubis like a pink, fleshy lightswitch. Some of it I attribute to his terror and some to his recent loss of blood, but the unfortunate truth is that Iias member is woefully undersized. The look on his face when he regained consciousness and saw me holding and inspecting his penis would have been funny if I wasnt so concerned about whether or not I could get this to work. I really, really needed a knife.

Rummaging through Iias drawers, I found a vegetable peeler. The blade turned out to be very sharp. I grazed my forearm with it and happily discovered the edge was keen enough to remove hair. I truly sympathized for Iia at this moment. I didnt want to strike him in the head again, as I didnt want to contribute to any lasting brain damage should he live through his whole process. So, I chose to leave him awake as I ran the peeler up and down his penis, removing thin strips of skin. 

Much like the sound of my voice changed when my own nose was removed, so too had Iias. The few actual words he exclaimed sounded filtered through a very bad head cold. His screams, however, were mostly unaffected. These screams continued after Id finished peeling when he saw that I held the thin cord of his urethra. I felt quite a bit of relief when I found it could stretch further than Iias tiny penis had suggested.

Iia passed out from exhaustion or shock moments later. Right now, Im taking the time to finish this account of my evening and research the best way to approach the colon and begin the urethral routing. I will likely update you all with another story tomorrow to let everyone know how the last few bits of the process fared. Arent we lucky that these stories are considered fictional? Ill wait and work here worry-free. Enjoy Friday, everyone! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dumbwaiter </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-16 19:41:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Our new house was an old house. We spent tons of money on renovations and upgrades before we could live there. The basement was particularly heinous. After a while, it started coming around and was looking less like the pit of despair from when we bought it and more like the man-cave I dreamed of. Once everything was done, we finally moved in. 

One of the kids was poking around in her closet the other day and discovered an old dumbwaiter. I had no idea we had one of those. It led down into the basement, but apparently the compartment had been bricked up before we even moved in. When setting up my man-cave down there, I just plastered over the brick like any of the other walls.

During one of the worst snowstorms I can remember, we were all bored in the house. The two girls were playing in their room and my wife and I were trying to read in the dim light coming in from outside. The power had gone out about three hours earlier. Living in the middle of nowhere has its aesthetic perks but its definitely a tradeoff in the luxuries department. The kids were using the dumbwaiter, as always, sending one of their dolls down, making up a little story together, and then rescuing their doll when they pulled it back up from the bowels of the house. I heard a little bump when the kids accidentally bottomed it out in the basement. Then they pulled it back up.

The the youngest one screamed. I didnt even flinch. Theyre 4 and 7. Theyre always screaming. But then her sister started in. And they didnt stop. My wife and I ran upstairs and the girls were backed up against the far side of the wall wailing and crying. I tried to ask them what was wrong but they were inconsolable. The older one pointed at the closet. I went inside and looked. Inside the dumbwaiter compartment was their pet hamster, only really, really messed up. Its eyes were expelled from their sockets and all its guts were pushed out its backside in gristly tangles of rodent offal. 

My wife was trying to comfort the girls and theyd at least stopped screaming. They kept saying they never put the hamster in the elevator (thats what they called it) and he never left his cage. We didnt bother to chastise them for lying at that point - they were obviously too upset. My mind was elsewhere, though. I was trying to figure out what the hell happened to that hamster. It was inside the compartment, so it couldnt have gotten crushed underneath when the dumbwaiter hit the bottom. It almost looked like the poor thing got put in a vice and was squeezed to death.

We let the kids sleep in our room that night. The power was still out. My thoughts kept going to that hamster. There had to be a reason for it. I tiptoed out of the room, stepping over the kids sleeping bags, and went to their closet. I quietly worked the dumbwaiter up and down. On the third trip down, I felt the rope shudder when I accidentally struck the bottom. I hoped I didnt wake anyone up. I carefully pulled it back up. I thought it had gotten caught on something; it was heavier than it should have been.

I gradually got it back to the top without making any more noise and locked the handle and opened the door. The empty eye sockets of my youngest daughter gaped at me as she tumbled out of the dumbwaiter, her entrails sliding out after her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here's what happened last time.
](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2x8hdv/sockets/)

A little over a week after I submitted my story about spiders and pulling teeth, I received a message in my Reddit inbox. [Heres the link.](http://i.imgur.com/ul6zCWi.png)

After I read it, I experienced an entirely new sensation: I shivered with horror and nearly came in my pants. $250,000 is a TON of fucking money. No more college loans, no more 1983 Camry, no more 300 square foot apartment. All Id have to do is meet up with that lunatic again. Well - more than just meet up. I had a feeling Id be earning every cent of that 250k.

I replied to him and he quickly wrote back. I was to meet him the next morning at the same house.

I got there at 8:00. He greeted me at the door, his smile showing off his perfectly passable dentures. He hadnt aged much over the four years since wed last met. He was still thin and beautifully dressed and looked very healthy. I was so happy when he pointed to the fridge and told me there was more of my favorite beer inside. Before we went into the basement, I grabbed a Burton Baton and started nursing. 

The basement had a layout very similar to the last time. I almost cried with relief when I saw there wasnt anything resembling a shoebox full of spiders underneath the gray cloth covering what I assumed were more tools for the job. The man sat down in the same chair. It had some bloodstains on it from our previous encounter.

Pulling out my teeth was the first step in my transformation into a gecko lizard, he confidently claimed. This time I just came right out and asked, what the fuck are you talking about? I wasnt going to be as passive as I was last time. If the teeth-pulling was completely crazy, then this was another fucking dimension of nuts.

Geckos have very different dental structures than humans, the man said. Their teeth are much smaller and very sharp. I thought about shaving mine down but they just wouldnt be the same. Their faciocranial structure is vastly unlike our own, too, as Im sure youve noticed. Today we will be working on all those things, plus another if we have time.

He pulled back the cloth and revealed the familiar hammer and pliers. Accompanying them this time was a chisel, a carving knife, and a series of what looked like double-sided metal thumbtacks, each with a long pin on one side and a set of six shorter pins on the other.

Those are my new teeth, the man informed me. You will be putting them in the old sockets. All your money is in that big duffel bag next to the fridge upstairs. He took out his dentures and grinned at me with his pink gums. You can begin.

I sighed with deep resignation, turned around, and walked upstairs. Abita Turbodog, Foothills Sexual Chocolate, and Brooklyn Lager came back down with me. All the money had been there, too. Fuck.

When I got back, the man was patiently reclining in the dentists chair with his mouth agape. I peered inside. Perfectly clean holes peered back at me, reminding me of the work Id done those years ago. I picked up one of the pins and tentatively touched it inside the socket. The man brushed my arm away and said, the long side of those pins need to go deep so they dont fall out. He leaned back again and opened his mouth.

I drained my Turbodog while he spoke that last sentence. Sexual Chocolate time. After a few sips, I picked up the pin and hammer. I poked the tip into one of the bottom sockets in the front of his mouth and pushed. I felt it break the skin but didnt go far. At all. Fuck. I pushed a lot harder. I heard a little bit of a crunch and the tip disappeared about three more centimeters in. I still had about two inches to go. I guess it was hammer time.

I started tapping in the pin with the gingerness of an artist trying to tap in a hook to display a wall painting. The man smacked my leg and grunted what sounded like come on! with unveiled irritation. I slammed the hammer down, plunging the pin into his jawbone. It stuck and it didnt budge when I tried to wiggle it. Blood seeped from around the edges. 

Keep going, the man told me. I did.

Id jammed all the pins into his jaw without much of a problem save for one of the ones near the back. I was slightly off balance and the strong hammer blow caused the pin to go down on an angle and it erupted out the side his gums and jawbone. Splinters of bone and what looked like a white loop of nerve pushed out of the wound. I pulled the bone shrapnel away with the pliers and did my best to twist the nerve back into its home. Then I levered out the pin and nailed it in properly. Through the hole where Id made my mistake, I could see Id put the tip right through the nerve. The man didnt even twitch.

So, the new teeth were in. They looked truly bizarre; tiny, sharp metal spikes lining puffy, bloody gum tissue. My Sexual Chocolate was long gone. I opened the Brooklyn Lager and chugged the thing. Then I went upstairs to get more. Holy fuck Lagunitas Hop Stoopid.

The piney-tasting beer had an astringent quality that seemed to help wash away some of the dirtiness I felt. I fondled the 250k in the duffel bag and retreated back to the basement with the whole 4 pack. When I got there he was naked. Fuck.

Geckos dont have noses like us, he told me. Please remove mine. He handed me the hammer and chisel. The chisel was brand new and had a 3 edge like a razorblade. I really, really didnt want to do this.

He sat upright and I touched the edge of the chisel to the bridge of his nose right near the forehead. The skin broke immediately. That edge was really fucking sharp. I didnt even take the time to gather my thoughts. I brought the hammer down on the chisel as hard as I could. The nose sheared off his face with the ease of pulling rubber cement off the flap of an envelope. Blood poured out of the wound. The cartilage was completely severed; the remains of the organ hung loosely on what were the outer edges of his nostrils. I just grabbed it and yanked it off. The fucking guy looked bored.

Ears now, he said, his voice pitched differently and having a flu-like timbre. I repeated the nose move with his ears. Those came off even easier. 
The man now looked like something youd see as evidence in a war crime deposition. Except for the fact that now he wouldnt stop smiling. He jumped up from the chair and disappeared around the corner by the furnace and yelled dont forget to take your money!"

I dont know why I followed him. What good could have possibly have come of it? When I turned the corner, I saw an enormous glass tank. The man was inside, crouching on a rock. His hands were full of spiders and scorpions. More skittered around the bottom of the tank, which I should probably be calling a terrarium. Handful after handful disappeared into his mouth. His jaws worked and worked and I heard the sickening crunch as the arachnids turned to pulp in his spiked mouth. He swallowed everything he chewed and brown juice ran down his neck and chest. He walked up to the glass and looked at me. Next time we finish, he said, his mouth stuffed with writhing legs and pincers.

I nodded, trudged upstairs, took the duffel bag, and went home. Im sure Ill hear from him again once hes healed up. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a medical caretaker for a depressed man named Huey. For the last three years, I've lived with him and tended to whatever needs he might have - needs that have grown more numerous as time went by. He used to be a day-trader who made a pretty good amount of money with some unique trading strategies. It's not like he was rich or anything, but he made more than enough to keep me employed and to satisfy his addiction. As much as I wanted to help with that addiction, it was the one thing I wasn't allowed to address. All I could do was tend to him and try to minimize the harm as best I could. I knew the time would come when I'd just have to stand back and watch, helpless.

Huey awoke to the dull white noise that signified his eventual transcendence. He rolled out of bed; quite literally, as his girth had ballooned over the last nine years to a hair under 500lbs. His knees and ankles were terrifically swollen. The ligaments and joints had undergone immense stress because of his weight gain. Had today come a year later, there would have been a chance that he wouldn't have been able to walk.

But walk he did, into his kitchen. From the window, he saw a brownish-black mass outside. The mayflies had finally arrived. They had arrived in numbers that even he had refused to hope for. Here they were, though. In the flesh. And they would soon be in his.

Huey was a compulsive ingester. He needed to feel full - his body constantly felt like a gaping maw and his life had been spent trying, but ultimately failing, to relieve the physical feeling of emptiness. But today, this would end. He recognized how his failures had been the result of his small, pitifully-average mouth. To fill a hole quickly, the opening had to be larger. And the more openings there were, the faster it could go.

Huey stripped naked and stepped out into his front yard. He carried a large chef's knife. He opened his mouth as wide as he could while inhaling deeply. Flies filled his mouth and he chewed and swallowed. To him, it felt like an eyedropper attempting to fill an ocean. He was ready. First, he opened the corners of his mouth with his blade, creating a ghastly rictus that exposed his entire dental system. His mouth could achieve a much wider position now, and the flies filled it in greater numbers.

Next, he took the tip of the blade and began to unhinge his lower mandible. This took work, and Huey was no surgeon. This didn't matter much to him. The longer he took, the thicker the cloud of mayflies around him grew. They took to his wounds, laying their eggs, and doing whatever else mayflies did. Huey continued inhaling the flies into his gut as he carved, and he was finally successful in the removal of his lower jaw. His tongue lolled out obscenely and was instantly coated in the writhing mass of insects.

Encouraged, he continued. He made more and more cuts into his body, first shallow, then, once the flies began to accumulate, he went deeper. He decided to begin flaying his skin; the insects seemed to be attracted to his subcutaneous fat. Each one that landed on him and contributed its mass to his own gave him an infinitesimal sensation of fullness that had alluded him for so long. A tiny success was still a success. Huey, finally, was on the right track.

Minutes passed as he continued his excoriation. A passerby would see a pool of blood surrounding bits of skin on the ground, seething with flies, and above it all stood a morbidly obese, human-shaped figure completely covered by the swarming creatures.

With his external organs essentially removed and exposed to the flies, he began to work deeper. He opened his gut, spilling his viscera and allowing thousands of insects to fill him. I saw his strength waning and he fell backwards. Flies covered him, inside and out, and Huey's life slipped away. His final moments, however, must have been blissful. The emptiness had been chipped away. It wasn't complete, but it was something he could be proud of. And for the first time in his life, I think he was happy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Teeny-Tiny </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My doctors asked me to tell my story so other girls like me could read it and learn from my mistakes because Ill be dead soon. That makes me pretty sad to think about. I dont want other girls to be sick like I am. I guess they wont be sick exactly like me, because that would be crazy, but maybe they can read this so they wont make the bad decisions I made.

When I was little, Mom used to hold me and say stuff like, Oh Katie, you fit so perfectly on my lap! Youre so teeny-tiny! I loved it. Shed keep me warm and hug me and I felt so great. Id always go to Mom if I felt sad or scared and shed just scoop me up, saying whats wrong, my teeny-tiny girl? and Id tell her what was making me upset and shed always always always make it all better.

The most vivid memory I have was the day I turned 10. It wasnt of my party, which I vaguely remember being great, it wasnt the presents, some of which I still have, but it was when Mom had me in her lap that night and had tears in her eyes and said to Dad, Katies getting to be a big girl, huh? I dont remember what my dad said, but there was no denying it: I wasnt her teeny-tiny girl anymore. 

At 10 years old, I was about 410, maybe 100 pounds. I was growing fast. Both my parents are tall. I remember being scared. The scale kept going up, and by the time I was 11 I was 52, 120 pounds and I started getting boobs. At that point, when I was sad, mom would hug me tight and say the right things, but it all felt different. She never cradled me. She never had me in her lap. I felt cold and lonely even though I was never really cold or lonely. I just wanted to be closer to her like I was when I was little. So I decided to get little again.

Mom started to notice when I pushed around my food on the plate, trying to pile it up on one side to make it look like I ate more than I really did. Youre a growing girl, she said, kindly but firmly. You need to eat. I couldnt leave the table until I was done. 

That night after dinner, I remember lying on my back on the bed, staring at the ceiling and feeling the food in my stomach. Moms words youre a growing girl echoed in my mind and I felt so sick that I ran into the bathroom and threw up. I was really glad I had my own bathroom so they couldnt hear me puking. After I was done, I felt so much better. Lighter and smaller, even.

Mom was so happy to see me eating normally again. She had worried aloud that I might be getting the flu, so seeing me chowing down like my old self pushed those worries right out of her head. What she didnt see was how I went to bed afterward and while the bathwater ran I was throwing it all up. I did this every day for years.

One of the sad truths about throwing up your meals is that you dont lose all that much weight. I actually gained more. Sure, Id get rid of what Id eaten, but probably twice a week Id be lying in bed, wide awake, fingering my collar bones, hip bones, and ribs, and obsessing over food. Something inside me would snap, and Id run to the fridge or the cabinets and eat until I felt like I was bursting. Then, exhausted, Id go back upstairs and pass out on my bed. Calorie-for-calorie, after those twice-weekly binges I was eating more than I would if I was healthy. Except I really, really wasnt healthy. And nobody knew.

All this built up to the last few months after I graduated high school. I was 511, 175lbs. 17 years old. There was absolutely nothing I hated more than my body. I was constantly lonely and wanted to try to take my mind off it all. I decided to get a job. When I told Mom I found a position at a place that recycles old medical gear, she was really proud of me for taking the initiative. It was bittersweet; I knew she was starting to see me as an adult. Not her teeny-tiny girl. I felt like a complete and utter failure.

The recycling place where I worked dismantled big machines that hospitals used and sold the parts. I was the receptionist. I took phone calls and helped set up deliveries. The people I worked with were really nice and after a few weeks they gave me a key so I could get there early and have their coffee ready and their work orders printed out. That night, after everyone had left, I went back there and let myself in. I still feel bad about breaking their trust.

A couple days earlier my coworkers were bringing in an old machine. They all were wearing heavy gloves and had on breathing gear like scuba divers. When they were done, I asked what it was. Apparently it was something hospitals use to give radiation therapy to cancer patients. I didnt know too much about that, so when I got home I went on Wikipedia and did a lot of research and then I got my idea.

When I let myself in that night, the place was empty. I made a beeline for where they had that radiation therapy machine and I investigated it. Most of it was completely dismantled. What I was looking for was conveniently labeled and brightly marked in a massive lead container. It took me a while to get the cover off. Leads so heavy! But after I did, I saw a round metal part that looked like a wheel. I picked it up, rotated the mechanism, and it opened a little window in the front. A faint blue light was inside. I held it up to my eye and looked in. Nothing but that light. I thought it was probably what I was looking for.

I brought the object home with me and locked the door of my bedroom. I worked to pry the thing open with a screwdriver but it seemed locked from the inside. Eventually I got frustrated and I turned the wheel again to open the window and pushed my screwdriver into the blue light stuff and tried scooping it out. It turned out to be pretty soft. A lot of it broke as I poked it with the screwdriver, and when I turned the wheel upside down, it tumbled out onto my desk. Now I could see how pretty it was. It was like chunks of glowing blue clay and sand. I gathered it up as best I could and put it away, save for the little bit I was going to use tonight.

One of the things Id read about radiation therapy was that it made the poor people with cancer really skinny. They just totally lost their appetites. I couldnt believe it was true. Id always had such a big appetite. I kept telling myself that I need to be really careful when I take this stuff because if I get too much of the radiation I could get cancer myself. I took a pinch of the blue stuff, put it in my mouth, and swallowed it with a gulp of water. It felt warm going down even though the water was cold. Since Id gotten home from the recycling place Id been pretty warm, in fact. Cozy. Like a little puppy under a blanket.

That night I woke up sweating worse than Id ever sweated in my life. The bed was totally soaked. Gross. I figured weight loss was weight loss. Water weight wasnt really what I wanted, but it was better than nothing. I took a shower and changed the sheets and went back to bed. My stomach ached a little.

When I woke up the next morning, my stomach hurt and I threw up a couple times. But, I wasnt even remotely hungry. That alone made the pain in my tummy pretty much go away. I didnt need to eat! Mom asked if I was bringing leftovers to work from last nights dinner and I lied and said we were going to get a pizza. I hate lying to Mom, but I didnt want her to worry. There was no need to tell her I wasnt hungry. At work, theyd finished disassembling the machine and started sending it out to wherever they send those things. Id been really careful to put the canister back exactly as I left it. No one checked to see if the little wheel was still there.

The next few days were uneventful, aside from my stomach ache getting worse and having to puke once or twice. Id barely eaten anything since I started taking the radiation medicine. Whenever I got woozy from lack of food I ate an apple or a fat-free yogurt and I was fine. I was still sweating a lot. When I got on the scale, it said 168.

After a week of eating nearly nothing and faithfully taking my radiation medicine nightly, my stomach ache got really, really bad. Id stopped throwing up, but this time it felt like I needed to go to the bathroom. I went, and it was awful. There was so much - I was shocked. Id apparently eaten and kept down more than I thought. It was agony coming out, too. I got on the scale after, though, and that helped me feel a lot better. 161.

Over the next couple days, one or two people told me how pretty I looked. They asked me if I lost weight and I said yeah, maybe a few pounds. I beamed. Over my whole adolescence Id done nothing but get bigger. Now, finally, I was shrinking and on the way to teeny-tiny. I didnt feel too great, though. My tummy was constantly having me run to the bathroom and it still hurt afterwards. I figured I was getting rid of all the extra fat. 158.

I was in the shower about 10 days after I started taking the medicine and I was horrified to see some of my hair coming out. That was bad. Really, really, really bad. I stopped washing it immediately and let just the water rinse away the remainder of the shampoo. I got out of the shower and took like an hour blow drying my hair because I was too scared to use a towel that might pull more out. When the mirror was unfogged and my hair was dry, I checked to see how noticeable it was. There was a good-sized patch of bare, red scalp about 2 wide above my left ear. I pushed the hair around it down to cover the patch. Some more fell out. It had to be a nutritional deficiency from all the meals Id been missing. I put on my Titans hat and got dressed. When I brushed my teeth I noticed a little blood in the sink. I made a note to get some multivitamins after work.

I didnt shower the next day because when I woke up that morning, there was more hair on my pillow. My scalp was getting pretty visible. It looked prickly and raw but it didnt hurt. Since I was off work I stayed at home and looked online for all the nutritional deficiencies that might cause my hair to fall out and my gums to bleed. Most of the ones were covered by my multivitamin, so I tripled the amount I took just to be on the safe side. I had to go to the bathroom five times during the 15 hours I was awake. By the last time I was incredibly light-headed and so thirsty. I weighed myself before I started downing water and my radiation medicine. 150. The medicine had helped me lose 25 pounds in less than two weeks. 

Mom hugged me the next morning before I went to work. She ran her hands up and down my back and she remarked about how skinny Id gotten. Then, she said it: remember when I used to call you my teeny-tiny girl? I miss those days but I love you just as much as a grown up. Then she let me go. Pain, nausea, and despair washed over me. All of a sudden, my lightheadedness came back with a vengeance and I stumbled and fell on the kitchen floor. My hat fell off. With my head spinning, I vaguely remember Mom gasping, Katie what happened to your hair?! before I violently threw up on the floor and myself. It was all blood. I passed out to the sound of Mom screaming.

I dont know how much time went by at the hospital. I wasnt completely unconscious, but all I remember up until recently when they used drugs to wake me up were images of doctors in the same scuba gear as the guys at work and saying weird words like caesium chloride and sloughed and gray that didnt mean the color. 

Today, I cant move or talk and Im writing this using a cool keyboard that can pick out letters using the movements of my remaining eye. Like I said in the beginning, Ill be dead soon. Im not too fun to look at anymore. My hairs gone. And my lower jaw. And my skin. The nice doctors are giving me medication that helps me manage the pain and keep me alert. They asked if they could do tests and experiments on me to help understand what ingestion of the radiation medicine does to the human body. Apparently there was a man in Japan a few years ago named Hiroshi Ouchi who got a similar level of exposure and the same stuff happened to him. They said it would help other people in the future if they could compare our two cases. Of course I let them. 

I cant eat food anymore. My esophagus got cooked away. Same with my stomach. The doctors are keeping me hydrated with a tube in my butt. I dont really like to think about it. I guess all the excitement I get as I wait here is when they weigh me every six hours to see if Im able to retain the fluids they give me or if it all seeps out into the sheets. They hoist me onto a pad and a little machine voice says a number. This morning it said 72. The next time it was 69. 

Mom and Dad have to wear those scuba suits when they come visit. Moms always crying because shes not allowed to touch me. Dad just stares. Right before I started writing this, Mom bent down and started whispering to me some of the stuff I remember her saying when I was small. I closed my eye and imagined being warm and safe on her lap. I love you, my teeny-tiny girl, she sobbed. I would have smiled if I had a mouth.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Dollar signs floated through my vision when I answered that Craigslist ad a couple years ago. The ad wanted a male companion for 6 hours. No sex, nothing illegal, and, get this: it paid $10,000. Who wouldnt jump at 10k? 

We met at his house. His handshake was firm. He seemed solidly middle-class; modest home, basic decor, nothing ostentatious. A suburban bachelor pad. After our hellos, he asked if Id like something to drink. His fridge was stocked with microbrews. Good stuff! I grabbed a Dogfish Head 90 and he guided me to the basement. Thats where well be working, he said.

The basement was sparsely furnished. Most prominent was what looked like an old dentists chair with a table next to it. The table was covered in a gray cloth. The man handed me an envelope hed been carrying. $5000. You can have the rest when were finished, he told me. Itll only be a few hours. 

He sat in the chair. With a smile, he gave me my instructions: I want you to pull out all my teeth. As he spoke, he pulled the cloth away. Underneath was a pair of gardening gloves, pliers, a ballpeen hammer, and a shoebox. I processed the last 5 seconds for a good 30. Pull his teeth out? I asked him and he confirmed that what Id heard was, in fact, accurate. No more questions, now, he ordered, just do whatever you need to do to get them out. With that, sat back in the chair and opened his mouth.

Im not, and never have been, a fucking dentist. But, there he was. His mouth was wide open, exposing brilliantly white, healthy teeth. His gums were a soft pink and his tongue seemed to be patiently waiting on the floor of his mouth. I fingered the money in the envelope and chugged the remainder of my beer. You can run upstairs and get another one if you want, he told me. 

I ran upstairs, as suggested. Staring at the dozens of beers, I tried to gather my thoughts. Long story short: I said fuck it, grabbed as many as I could carry, and trudged back down into the basement. After cracking open a bottle of Rasputin imperial stout, I approached the man, his mouth still open, and tentatively pressed on one of his front teeth. It was smooth and firmly anchored in his jaw. I sighed and put on the gloves.

The feeling that came over me was one of resignation. I knew I was going to do what he asked, and I figured I could always leave with the 5k if it got any weirder. I picked up the pliers, which looked brand new and shiny, and gripped the front tooth Id poked. Applying careful pressure, I gently pulled back. It didnt budge. The man exhaled softly though his nose and his eyes rolled. My next pull was fierce and quick. The tooth bent toward me with an audible crunching sound. Blood seeped from behind it. Still, it was lodged in his gums. Muttering under my breath, I squeezed the pliers as hard as I could and pulled with all my weight.

The tooth came out and I fell on my ass. Still holding the pliers, I stared at what Id done. There was the tooth, white and gleaming, with an ugly, short root jutting from the top. I got up and looked at the man. Blood oozed from the hole in his gums. He sat, calmly, arms crossed in apparent impatience. I loosened my grip on the pliers and let the tooth fall on the concrete floor. 

The remaining top front teeth went easily enough now that I had an idea of what kind of work had to be put in. Never once did the man make a sound aside from small changes in his breathing when my hands were blocking his mouth. The blood was beginning to be a factor. It limited my grip and I frequently had to ask him to spit it out. He just swallowed. After the top six teeth were gone, I was presented with a problem. Molars. I drank a Lagunitas Lil Somethin' Somethin'.

I decided to wait on those and go with the bottom row. The leverage was easier with them. I could put the pliers straight down on the tooth and yank back and downward. Those six went quickly. Again, the problem. Molars. I drank a Fat Tire ale.

I took the hammer and asked him to clench his remaining teeth together. Then, I pulled back his cheek as far as it would go without breaking the skin. I tapped the molars with the hammer. He sighed in annoyance. I swung. Teeth exploded in shards of enamel into his mouth. I took the pliers and yanked out what was left dangling. I repeated this on the other side. Then, all that were left were the wisdom teeth.

The hammer trick worked on the top ones. The bottom ones, though, were a bitch. I stood on the chair, reached in with the pliers, squeezed, and pulled. They came out with the sound of a shrub being ripped out of the ground. And then I was done.

The man grinned at me; his mouth a crater-filled wreck. He drooled blood from the corners of his mouth. Reaching into his jacket pocket, he pulled out the other envelope and handed it to me. I thanked him and backed away. As I was counting it out, he reached into the shoebox that was on the table. When he opened it, my spine immediately started tingling. 

The box was filled with spiders. From the look of them, they were brown recluses. They skittered up his forearm and he clenched a handful of them in his fist. Then he stuffed them in his mouth. I could see his jaw working as if he was chewing - which was now impossible because of the status of his teeth. He beckoned for me to come closer. Id finished counting; he hadnt shorted me. I moved forward maybe an inch. I like their little legs in the sockets, he choked out. They tickle.

I ran. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still don't regret what I did, despite the fact I'm now transformed. I'd always wanted to be a dinosaur.

I strode out onto the hot tar. In my mind's eye, I could see my nude body - a beautiful contrast of white skin on ebony bitumen. The surface was hot. Scalding. The soles of my feet were immediately engulfed in searing pain. They'd blister, but I didn't mind. What I had ahead of me would be far more damaging.

Dinosaurs were so beautiful. How huge they were! How powerful! I stomped my scorched feet into the tar, feeling the substance rise up between my toes. I clenched them, the sensitive skin in between getting covered. I roared.

Now, I could act out my means of communion with the beasts. I pressed my body into the tar. Chest down. Face down. I burned. I ground my face into the road, opened my mouth, and bit as hard as I possibly could. The majority of my front teeth loosened immediately. I bit even harder, using the leverage of my head on the ground to force my chin into the act. My teeth gave up. I knew they'd be found by paleontologists someday. I was so happy for their future excitement.

My raw gums were coated in tar. My arms, chest, stomach, genitals, thighs, and feet were coated in tar. Rolling over, I covered the rest of myself. My gaping mouth gouted blood through the substance that was hardening on my lips. My back and buttocks, now burned and covered, completed my transformation. All that was left was the inside.
Handful after handful of the pitch disappeared down my throat. My internal temperature caused it to cool significantly, blocking my esophagus. I gasped for breath, a rictus of pleasure etched upon my face. My friends died this way so long ago. Now I'd be one with them. I closed my eyes and waited.

I cried when I realized I was getting pulled out and taken away. I saw my reflection in the mirrored sunglasses of the EMT - a blackened face with a red hole for a mouth. They couldn't take the bitumen off without excoriating me down to the muscle. I was peeled; now I'm pink and itchy. My fingernails don't grow anymore. Sometimes I poke my tongue up into the holes where my teeth used to be. Knowing they're still out there makes me happy. I let out a little, happy roar.  </TEXT>
