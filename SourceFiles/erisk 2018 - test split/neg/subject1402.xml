<TEXT> Spain: Great quality tap water but tastes poorly along most of the med coast since it's hard and full of minerals. 

More than 50% of households therefore consume bottled water generating 6-8 billions of bottles of plastic per year. As this generally doesn't get recycled it most of the plastic ends up in landfills and then leaches into the ground water and recovers and finally the sea. Soon we cannot eat any fish anymore due to the amount of plastic.

Refuse plastic!

<TEXT> Actually. The issue with cheap restructuring loans is probably that it would have kept property prices artificially inflated. 

They partially managed to do this anyway though for a long time as people didn't understand that property valuations could go down.

The political and socio economic issue though as I see it is that the wealthy generally tended to profit from the crisis while the middle class lost out. There is no solution in sight to this as the wealth gap keeps increasing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True with smaller retail banks. US indirectly bailed out bear strain, Merrill Lynch, etc by supporting them.

Anyway, my point was it's very unlikely that letting the banks fail would have been a better route for Spain. In the end I think the government will profit from the banks in Spain as well thanks to the value of the property assets as the market recovers. UK government is at the point of break even now.

 But you already commented on this above. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's your source for this information? Barcelona's tap water is as good as most other tap water in Europe. I know because I've been working with drinking water for several years. The only issue is the taste. The exception is people with very sensitive stomachs but then you're more likely to get sick from food and other bacteria.

<TEXT> Welcome to Barcelona! 
1. Cool restaurants depends a lot on taste but you definitely need to pick a couple by the beach like Gallito (Spanish), Escriba (great paella for lunch by the beach), CDLC (Asian food primarily), Bestial (mix), vaso de oro (amazing tapas) and a bit more central Ciudad Condal (great allaround tapas for a good price). 
2. For entertainment it's probably a good with place real (Ocaa) and maybe flamenco around there even though it's obviously very touristic. Also look for concerts at musica de Palau.
3. Clubs. You will probably like the beach places like shoko, cdlc or pacha. Cdlc is free to get in before 1am I think. Note that most places don't fill up until 2.30/3am.
4. Water temperature depends on preference. A lot of people swim but it's pretty cold around 17 degrees at the moment I think.

Check out Foursquare which is one of the most reliable apps for tips in barcelona.

And watch you wallets, phones and hand bags. Unfortunately too many people get pick pocketed in barcelona.

Avoid plastic bottled water. It's bad for the environment and the tap water is clean (although it might taste a bit more of chlorine).

Enjoy your holiday! </TEXT>
