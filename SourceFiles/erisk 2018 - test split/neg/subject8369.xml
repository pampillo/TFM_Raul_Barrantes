<TEXT> I do find it unusually upsetting because I deal with entitled crap like that every day at work where people expect the rules bent for them, or break the rules, and then use the system is against me victim logic when caught. 

It feels like a lot of the shittier things in this world is because entitled pricks like this guy abuse resources and other people and then blame everyone else when caught. If rules are not enforced then why should anybody follow them and saying well most people are decent and follow the rules so why does it matter if some people do not... know incentivizes indecency. 

Also, glad you get to feel superior judging me without knowing anything about me... maybe I am bored and have trouble sleeping, or slow day at work, or maybe can't get around much because of issues, or go on Reddit to get away from my life issues, or maybe don't have friends... we are all on Reddit, I am not trolling, what's it to you why I am here? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tragedy of the commons? 

Property ownership has been at the core of most human societies as people stopped being nomads. 

For nomadic society their society is based around cattle or hunting territory. Part of the basic tenants of society governs ownership and sustainable control of limited resources.

Ownership of property and capital allows for the advancement of human society and has allowed for the creation of cities and advanced institutions and is the basis for midern life. Land is a big part of that, and a lasting and important commodity in human society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there is a revision of history in certain circles that tries to make Hitler into some effective populist leader undone by his generals, Soviet numbers and American arms, who happened to have an unfortunate side hobby of industrially murdering Jews (these revisionists tend to downplay the number he murdered).

They forget that genocide was the doctorine, not the side effect and that Hitlers plan was only sustainable through the conquest or large territories and obliteration of their peoples... the Jews were just the start. He refused to allow retreats because his vision and plan required those territories where he planned to murder 100s of millions and colonize with germans. This was the endgame.

3) Return to negotiating table.

4) Get foreign aid/concessions.

5) Violate agreement.

6) Rinse, lather and repeat.

Their primary exports are coal and slave labor. They have concentration camps. Most of the country goes hungry while the elite lives like western billionaires.

They have mismanaged their industrial and agricultural sectors and can't support themselves. This isn't poor little Kim being abused by the west not letting him sell coal to feed his people... it's Kim, abusing his people unable to get foreign countries to subsidize his 1950s style communist totalitarian state.

They got some of it funded by seizing assets and murdering parts of their own popoulation and needed to invade their neighbors to continue. For all the effectiveness of public works like the autobahn, much of the rest of the industrial activity resulted in little benefit for the average German and was not generating sustained economic growth.

<TEXT> Seriously, any gains he achieved were unsustainable, and his management of the civil and military aspects of Germany was amateur at best and many of his successes came as strokes of luck. Some of his subordinates were more effective than others but much of that was also luck as their positions were based as much on ideological grounds as personal ties and loyalty to Hitler.

He was a very accomplished propagandist and orator although he did luck into a natjonal mood amenable to his messaging and an existing moverment/organization in the form of the freikorps to add paramilitary muscle to his propoganda. 

He also lucked into a convenient boogieman, the communists, in getting establishment Germany to back him. The old conservative guard (who would later form the core of the Valkyrie assasination attempt) helped lift him to power in an attempt to counter leftist movements (only to ultimately lose everything because of it). 

Hitler is not so much an example of leadership, as a testament to the dangers of steam rolling reactionary populist sentiment backed by conservative elements trying to regain control, and the almost invetable war of conquest and genocide to feed the resulting ideology and unsustainable government initiatives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, for a significant back fracture opiates are reasonable... I don't know why you didn't get them. The problem is in this thread people are treating all back pain as the same. Back spasms, slipped disks, radiculpathy, just chronic back pain are not well served with long term opiates. 

An acute fracture especially requiring a brace, which is acute reversible bony pain, it's not unreasonable to get opiates... it's actually what they are meant for (outside of cancer/ acute abdominal pathology etc) so I don't diagree with you. Your initial comment wasn't clear. 

As for ibuprofen being ok for fractures? Most orthopedists and neurosurgeons give it to humans all the time with no change in healing. There are no human studies showing it to be a problem. Older doctors quote this based on a mouse study and theory but has not borne out. If you pull out a recent review it will discuss how in vitro and animal models have conflicting results, human studies are inconclusive, and they will hedge their bets saying in patients with high risk for non union (elderly, diabetics, smokers, etc) NSAID use should be limited. In older people we already avoid ibuprofen because of risk for stomach bleeding, heart attack and stoke. Young lawschool student ok for ibuprofen (although with food no alcohol becuase of risk of stomach bleeding).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, it depends on the cause of back pain, people have pain for different reasons... amytriptylline is a anti depressant which works for neuropathic pain.

Medication is applied chemistry to a system we poorly understand and opiates high jack a system not meant to be long term stimulated. Long term opiate use cause long term changes to that system that are problematic. Dependence and tolerance are pharmacological events. 

Wtf is even permanent spinal injury anyways? Are we talking radiculopathy? Or actually soinal cord injury? That's the problem, is that not all pain is the same, opiates are for a specific subset of short term pain. 

It's amazing, somehow other countries get by without the metric tons of opiates the US consumes every day. And people take any discussion personally without any nuance in regard to the 1000s of causes of back pain and indicate treatment. Compression fracture? Fine opiates. Bulging disk for past decade? Probably not... </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) tolerance... with any prolonged use you will need an ever increasing dose.

2) dependence... you will get a pharmacological dependence, so you can have withdrawal and a need that can progress to addiction. At some point you just need a baseline amount of opiate to function so you don't withdraw instead treating your pain.

3) You become tolerant to respiratory effects faster than the pain effects so at certain doses you just run the risk of not breathing... and still being in pain.

4) they are sedating and have other adverse effects on normal function.

5) opiate hyleranalgesia... you become less tolerant of pain in general when off opiates (controversial).

6) studies suggest opiates don't help people be more functional and long term doesn't really make a difference in pain scores.

7) long term opiate use has side effects like sleepiness and constipation, it can also cause stomach pain because of the problems with you gut working.


Alternatives:
Complicated, depends on your cause and the type of pain (nerve, bony, muscle pain)... for some diet, weight loss and exercise, for some its anti depressants (for nerve pain old school one like amytriptyline), for some it's surgery, and others it's nsaids and time...

Our armanamentarium for pain isn't great...  but we are starting to find out opiates are a short term crutch which long term makes it worse. 

Other developed countries use a fraction of the opiates we use and they get on about their lives without worse functional outcomes or being in pain all the time.

Not to sound corny, but it's about america changing cultural expectations and focusing on mental health and fitness and lifestyle. Less sitting, less driving, healthier food, access to mental health. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any opiate that hits the mu receptors can cause withdrawal and tramadol withdrawal unlike other opiates has a seizure risk. It also interacts with other medications to lower seizure threshold. Furthermore it is habit forming, dependence forming and addictive too.

If you use it daily or multiple times daily you for a prolonged period of time you are can withdraw.

Also, you can't get high on antidepressants. Also overdosing on antidepressants is unpleasant and still doesn't give you a high... which is why outside of suicide attempts people do not do it.

<TEXT> Tramadol is a crappy drug with seizure risks and is messy meanhing it hits multiple receptors so cause some other effects. You can have seizures in withdrawal, you can have siezures in therapeutic dosing and in overdose. It interacts with other meds that lower seizure threshold. It is habit and dependent forming, has poor or limited pain control and being an opiate is still not indicated for back pain. You still get tolerance, dependence etc.

Maybe valium or flexeril or robaxin to take the edge off but still not great from long term use. Honestly some things hurt and take time to heal... it's something people have to accept. There is limits to what medicine can do and sometime a long term holistic view is required. 5 months of suffering is nothing compared to lifelong dependence. 

Also good luck studying on opioids. Good luck functioning. And people also develop opiate hyperanalgesia where they tolerate pain worse.

After 5 months of tramadol or worse oxycodone good luck stopping, you will have to wean yourself becuase you would go into withdrawal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nsaids, in particular ibuprofen don't impede healing, that was a claim made onsome bad rat studies but does not bear out in humans.

Back pain sucks but long term opiate use is risky. Just because you went to a decent law school does not mean you aren't at risk for dependence and tolerance.

Opiate use is not appropriate for long term back pain and also would have made your studies difficult. If you became dependent and developed life long opiate habit you would ruin your life.

Yes it hurt, back pain hurts and not much helps, however most studies suggest long term  opiates are not the answer.

Also if you weren't in a brace it was probably a mild fracture like coccyx or transverse process and the opiates are particularly unnecesary.

Sorry you had a crappy time but in the long run it was probably better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure but also Americans refuse to wait for anything, accept any risk, accept any lifestyle responsibility, tolerate pain etc...

We spend so much money torturing elders at the end of their life to prolong it for a brief period of time. We do too many CT scans, too many MRIs, to many surgeries, etc. Every cancer has to be fought, every condition intervened on. 

Instead, we need to focus on quality of life, cost effective care, and reasonable limitations on care without people freaking out about "death panels"...

Furthermore, we as a society need to invest in the quality of life of our citizens because these drive healthcare costs. Healthier food availability, walkable communities, less sedentary lives, less stress, less opiates...

With all the baby boomers who don't tolerate any pain, are scared of death, are overweight and unhealthy, entitled and have no savings start to overload our hospitals the game is over...

Also the as much as healthcare is a drain on the economy, the gross disproportionate sector of the economy, unequal compensation, and brain drain of the financial services sector is a problem too... </TEXT>

If obama said what trump said, regarding the constitution and seperation of powers, Fox News hosts would be foaming at the mouth and calling for riots/impeachment/arms hoarding becuase obama was going to impose martial law. Trump says it and not a peep. 

Also why does trump even want more power, he has no actual political aims other than feel successful/ important/liked by the press/enrich himself. I almost wonder if he is jealous of erdwans ability to jail reporters and Putins out right murdering them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is rising nationalism and the concern is the Japan, in never really owning the human rights atrocities of the 30s and 40s, sets up the potential for a resurgence of militarism built around WWII symbols and doctrines. 

This is particularly problematic because aside from geopolitical issues in the region, the surrounding countries, allies like SK, and non-allies like China and NK, are all still rather sore about the rape, murder, medical experimentation, biochemical warfare, slavery and prostitution of their population by the Japanese... which the Japanese only really have partially acknowledged. 

The guy who ran Unit 731, the Japanese version of Mengele, unlike Mengele who died in exile a pauper... went on to run one of Japan's largest pharma companies. The guy who ran the rape of Nanking was a royal who escaped prosecution. Abe visited the shrine were some of Japan's A class war criminals are buried. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was an unarmed/ minimally armed supply ship so nominally needed an escort.

However, the "destroyer" Japan sent is actually huge (3x bigger than most destroyer) and is actually a helicopter carrier that can only really do anti-submarine warfare in this scenario (no missile interception). Has no offensive weapons of its own and carries no STOVL jets for air defense/anti surface warfare/missle defense.

OTOH the main threat from NK is submarines. 

But America has more than enough ships in the region to spare for escort duty. 

So mainly a, we are in this together, kind of display... oh and btw a message to NK that Japan now has a more offensive posture than in the past.  </TEXT>

Modern Chinese Navy? 2 aircraft carriers (soon), 3rd being build (with catapults), modern chinese radar on their latest destroyers, advances in sub tech and planes, and numbers have a quality of their own... Australia would not fair well, only probably saved by the fact that major urban centers on the Southern side of the continent.

In the pacific, the only force outside US comparable to China are Japan and distant 3rd South Korea. 

India of on its own has some modern ships but given mismanagement of their navy and aging fleet carriers and support ships, unclear how effecive a fighting force they are vs China. </TEXT>

So director of security at infowars is related to blackwater -- which was founded and run by the borther of Trump's education secretary -- who also was involved in a secret island meeting with Russia -- Trump praised Alex Jones and went on his show -- while Russia was pushing pro-trump propoganda to sway the election.

<TEXT> Trump has little foundational knowledge and little experience actually running a complex organization. 

His business is just a large family wealth fund grounded in real estate. It's run through a rather rudimentary s corp ane operates without accountability or disclosures. 

It's not like Trump ran Apple or GM or even a midsize organization like a hospital or a regional brand. Add in a knowledge deficit on most aspects of government and the fact that no rational person is going to risk their career by working for him and you get a situation where:

1. He doesn't know what he is doing
2. He doesn't know how to organize his staff 
3. He doesn't have enough of a staff
4. Experienced staff won't work for him
5. He lacks the connections to staff the government
6. Those who do work for him have ulterior motives
7. He has no ideology or doctrine so staff can't work independently to advance the administration agenda, identify problems, generate solutions.
8. His ~~parties~~party's ostensible agenda will hurt their own base. The party cannot even advance an agenda through other government branches because they won't be re-elected because their platform is not actually fit to govern.

The republicans seized all levers of power and now realize they don't know what to do with those levers or what the levers even do. Trump is incompetent, his staff is a shell of incompetents and ideologues,  he has no experience with government or running a large organization, his election platform is undeliverable and self-contradictory, his party has no feasible or passable platform for him to fall back on.

The country is currently like a headless chicken. The brain stem works so it can shit and walk around but it's screwed if anything mode complex arises and eventually it will starve to death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suppose Trump doesn't care about the global economy or Seoul. Within the first hour of the conflict, Seoul, millions of South Koreans are at risk from a conventional North Korean artillery barrage (35 miles).

That is the dirty secret, Kim does not need nukes, his artillery can hit Seoul. That is millions of lives at stake (10 million population). 

The global economy won't handle to the obliteration of the capital of a major economy (11th by GDP), the headquarters of Hyundai (18th largest company), LG, Samsung (13th largest company). 

Not to mention the destabilization of East Asia as the power balance is upset. God forbid there is a nuclear exchange. China has to decide if their troops enter Korea. Who is going to absorb the refugees? SK troops and US troops cross the DMZ? Run into Chinese troops? 

The whole situation portends to be a cluster on an unprecedented scale.

<TEXT> Trump wants his aides to distil it to 1 choice... and since as you pointed out the government at the senior level is half staffed, and they fired everyone before getting replacements, it is really Kushner or whatever aide is the flavor of the month, given Trump 1 choice. Amateur hour with nukes, geopolitics, taxes and healthcare... buckle up America. That 1 page tax proposal probably taxed the Trump administration's policy capabilities... just wait what happens when faced with real crises....

Also, in the absence of government staffers, the legislation and policy is written by corporations like we saw on the executive orders allowing coal to pollute rivers. Diplomats are irrelevant at this point because Trump has no cohesive foreign policy... foreign diplomats are saying they have started ignoring Trump pronouncements since they change so rapidly and are often rapidly disputed by himself or senior administration.

Example: Nato is irrelevant, next day Pence tells them the are essential. China needs to fix NK. Talks to chinese leader and takes back his earlier statements. Same with NAFTA... No one knows what to expect from a Trump administration that is totally reactionary and clueless. 

The problem is he doesn't have the organization, the people and ideas to actually create policy and maneuver in Washington. Because he is an empty shell and a con man he is going to slip into irrelevance... and Trump is not a man to handle irrelevance very well so the worry is that he will do something insanely stupid (like bomb NK) to get attention again... 

Lets us hope that when the time comes, when faced with a destructive order, the junior level staffers/undersecretaries are ready to say, "no Mr. President, as an American, I cannot follow that order." </TEXT>

He doesn't have the connections,  the people, the intellectual framework, or the charisma to run the government... this and the 40% of America that buys it or just despises politicians/elite/complex thoughts/books is all he will ever have.

Early on he had opportunities. If he turned around and said we will put Gorsuch to SCOTUS, but next we will put Garland, or if he just put Garland on then he would have neutered a lot of democratic ammunition against him. 

He could have pushed real bipartisan health care reform, or a bipartisan tax package. He can do it because he needs democratic support and he is not that behooven to the actual republican party.

The problem is he doesn't have the organization, the people and ideas to actually create policy and maneuver in Washington. He had a real opportunity but because he is an empty shell and a con man he is going to slip into irrelevance... or do something insanely stupid (like bomb NK) to get attention again... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed, trial by firing squad vs hanging was a convention thing, criminal vs military, so symbol-wise hanging him was important. 

Executions are not to make the perpetrator pay... he can never repay his wrongs, they are a mechanism for society to sanction inappropriate actions.

But let us not reduce his role in one of the largest and most brutal genocides and oppressive regimes as a mere paper pusher. The nazis are one of the few examples in history of an almost comically 2 dimensionally evil enterprise on a continental and even near global scale and he played a central role in propagating these actions.

<TEXT> Addicts come in different flavors. Some do benzos, some cocaine/ meth, some opioids... saying addicts like opioid suggests that there is a sub class of people who are just addicts... the truth is much more complex. 

People are predisposed to different substances differently and have different risks of becoming dependent or addicted. Some people drink their whole lives but are never alcoholics and some people try alcohol once and then cannot get enough. Same with opioids.

Narcotics are very addictive. Drugs have different addiction rates, opiates in long term use have a rather high rate. And if you add dependence in (which is different than addiction but still and issue) the problems are even worse. 

A lot of those studies suggesting opioids were not very addictive was pushed and funded by pharma. It now seems that those previous studies were wrong and some are based on old data that does not take into account modern synthetic opioids. 

It seems like in addition to the typically predisposed population who biochemically are just more susceptible to opiods there are people who are at risk.

It seems like duration of use matters, greater than 3 days sets up more risk. Other social and psychiatric issues probably play a role. Furthermore, not all opiates are equally addictive. Vicodin is less addictive than oxycodone or percocet. High potency short acting opiates seem to be more addicting. 

Physicians were taught by purdue driven studies that you cannot get addicted to opioids if you are not using them recreationally and that simply proved false. 

Ask any clinician and they run into this all the time....

Also, with the easy street availability of heroin and fentanyl, if someone gets cut off from opioids its very easy to transition.  </TEXT>

I wonder if China is worried about the precedent of a missile shield in the area or that it might destabilize NK. An NK who worried about the neutralization of their nascent nuclear deterrent might be more likely to lash out first. 

China is also full of shit as they built radar installations, airstrips and long range anti air and missile emplacements all over the south china sea in violation of international courts and treaties and aggressively violate other countries waters and freedom to transit international waters. 

Chinese "fishing boats" harrass other countries, poach fish, violate marine sanctuaries, over fish, and spy... and now china is building huge heavily armed "coast guard cutters" with heavy caliber guns and long range endurance.

China is worried this diminishes their nuclear deterrence and their carrier-killing ballistic missiles, but again it's unclear that US naval assets do not already have that capability. 

I think China just doesn't know the capabilities of the new system (maybe they forgot to hack the relevant defense contractor like they did with many major US weapons systems) and is worried about dealing with unknowns. Or they are worried that this will set a precedent for future missile defense shields like in Europe...

The situation is complex... China is a hypocrite because no one likes their long-range air defense installations and runways to project their power over the entire south China sea and economic zone.  </TEXT>

Everything reduced to a torrent of short sound bites... people get used to this torrent and are unable to do complex long cognitvely intensive tasks. 

Pizzagate is a classic example. Its either an oganic outgrowth of a preconditioned popoulation or actively pushed narrative by some entity.

Basically snippets of information, intrigue, linked to together with loose associations. No time intesive cognitevely complex information.. rather just intuitive random associations. Add in the aura of mystique by adding in nefarious organizations and leading political oepratives.

Add in an an anti establishment pro trump angle... and people take this hook line and sinker. Promoted on some sites (infowars whose star admitted to it being an act) to some people in positions of power (flynn, aka russian agent)... and it gets credence.

Then 100s of people on the internet do "research"... aka image searches and simple good searches, and then spin them into the narrative.

<TEXT> Possible, I do not know that we know that for certain. Also opiod and alcohol dependence abuse are a complex interplay of social, psychological and biochemical elements. For sure some canabis crossover effects in the mu and delta receptors might play a roll, but its effects on other pathways involved in everything from anxiety to depression might play a roll as well.

It is not surprising that one sedating substance off sets use of other sedative type substances likely alcohol and opiates and we know that the latter have a high morbitiy and mortality associated with them. 

I am curious to see what the long term effects of marijuana are on a population level when substituted for other drugs. Do people eventually come off of canabis. What are the risks of smoking vs edibles. 

Do people remain in a status quo, the marijuana helps with a holding pattern but does not allow addressing the underlying habits, social and psychological issues that drove the substance use (although address the biochemical aspects)...

Basically, are we accepting modern life to be a level of shitty that requires some large subset of our population to require life long habitual drug use to function without spiraling into more addictive and destructive drugs? </TEXT>

Alcohol and narcotics have terrible long-term morbidity and mortality and health effects. 

The real question is cannabis better and what are the long-term effects. Also, compared to getting people off of substances altogether what are the downsides for cannabis as a long term strategy. Furthermore, does it decrease the number of people who get clean altogether? Is canabis a stable long-term subsitute or do people relapse?

Pizzagate and Clinton foundation stuff while the government swamp is filled twice deeper. Sketchy Russia connections. Out in the open nepotism.

<TEXT> Yeah, public understanding of needing opiates is driven by cultural expectations created by pharma to sell more opiates.

Opiates are appropriate for short courses for specific symptoms. There is always risk of dependence and addiction, the longer the use the more the issues. People on narcotics develop less tolerance for pain in general: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid-induced_hyperalgesia. The truth is a lot of people never needed the opiates and now people expect them. Everyone thinks their need is legitimate and everyone else is dependent or an addict.

<TEXT> 1) Advil or Motrin (ibuprofen): toxic to kidneys (stay hydrated), and stomach bleeding (take with food), and long term use can increase stroke and heart attack (less proven). Don't combine with alcohol because of risk of stomach ulcers.

Alleve (naproxen): same as ibuprofen but less theoretical risk if strike or heart attack.

Tylenol/Paracetamol (acetaminophen): in large doses or long term medium dose use runs risk of liver toxicity. Don't combine with alcohol because liver toxicity.

2) high dose opiates work fur a little but then you develop dependence, opiate induced hyperalgesia and then you will be in more pain and opiate dependent. Past a certain dose risk of death dramatically increases because your tolerance for your brain not telling you to keep breathing  doesn't grow as fast as the pain effects.

If I read another article about an Appalachian or Kentucky coal country trump voter talk about how they are dependent on obama care for life saving care and didn't think trump and the republicans would actually repeal it, I will have a minor stroke. 

But it is important to realize that there are many blue collar community in America that are hurting and it's important to listen for their issues... because in someways these groups are the proverbial canaries in the gold mine. 

Le Pen is a fascist. Her core supporters are fascists. But Europe is also having trouble with the shear rate of migrants, the poor assimilation of migrants, cultural issues (like women's rights). Walk around parts of French urban centers and you will get hastled and hustled by migrants looking to make a buck... it's unpleasant.

So while acknowledging Le penn and her core backers as a problem, not recognizing the challenge migrants pose, the escalating problem as Syrian, African, Afghany conflicts continue... will drive people into her camp... and that's how you get fascism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, why do we fixate on WWII culturally? 

Vietnam is a problem because it too close for man people. Still lots of people who served with lots of PTSD.

Also complex in that America did not win and the enemy was fighting for their independence from a colonial power... of course chinese and russian geopolitical aims further muddied waters, but ho chi min was a freedom fighter first, communist second. Ho chi min wanted US backing after Israeli independence but got turned down by french colonial interests. He then turned to Russia. Finally, America didn't achieve their aims despite leveling half the country and 10s of thousands of US casualities... oh and that image of the US helicopter over the US embassy and marines pushing hueys off of carrier decks to make room for refugee choppers.

Korea. Well again, muddied conflict, Mcarthur's hubris, and advance to the chinese border, chinese involvement, results was stalemate at the same starting line. Weapons marginally different from WWII makes it even feel similiar to a WWII game but with geopolitical baggage. 

Desert strom... too one sided. Bosnia... to soon, to much genocide, Western intervention too much overwhelming western firepower...

Falklands... talk about geopolitical shit storm, basically argentine conscripts and a few special forces against a run down British fleet... a politically limited conflict defined as much by weapons malfunctions and geopolitical realities as anything else. Malfunctioning exocets, mismanaged diesel electric subs that never entered the conflict, under trained and under supplied argentine soldiers, a jury rigged british flottilla of civllian and miliarty ships with an aging carrier saved from retirement... ultimately actually faily limited military action... yeah terrible game. Oh both the brits and argentines are still upset about the whole thing. 

Seriously, flaklands air war simulator... argentine jets running out of fuel, against harrier jump jets with limited engagment time, all subsonic...

Sierra Leone... genocide... not good video game material. Even WWII games dont have much concentration camp missions...

WWII, safe material, internationally accepted "good guys", far enough ago, in American and European cultural consciousness so people feel comfortable with the general hx... games generally avoid the holcoaust thing...

WWI... long ago, less clear "bad guy", but 'merica, and the germans don't feel as bad about it... also different enough tech and feel from WWII so different mechanics. Less genocide and away from the main theatre... safe game material.

Vietnam, korea... geo policital (and some racial baggage)
Falkands... geo political baggage, not much opportunity for material
Bosnia, sierra leone... genocidem to soon
Desert storm? one sided
Ruso-Japanese war? One sided, still sore spot, AMericans dont really care about it.
Spanish-American war? Americans dont really care
etc, etc. Companies do what is safe and easy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not quite true, Sherman's and t34s could take on most German tanks with the mark exception being tigers and somewhat the panthers. The flak 88 guns where also a problem but allied artillery, Air Force, and numbers did the trick. 

But American agricultural output was enormous, yes Canada contributed but American plains states produced enormous amounts of grain and meat. American ships got it to Europe, America trucks carried it the front while Germans relied on horses for logistics. Not taking away Canada's contributions, just more awknolodging the juggernaut that was America. 

Also the British brains thing is offensive... Bletchley park, proximity fuses were helpful but American designs and tech were also insrumental. American generals were largely effective leaders, at the least as effective as their British counterparts. Not hating on the brits, but dismissing American technological, leadership and logistical contributions is inane.


America was backing England early on, although American companies individually worked with Nazis, Roosevelt was just looking for an excuse to join the war when the Japanese gave him Pearl Harbor. Lend lease and other programs meant american goods were flowing to largely England. 

America itself was untouched by the war. Her literally undprecedented and unmatched industrial and agricultural capacity set the next 50 years. Argentina who was agricultural export dependent and enourmosly wealthy until 1946 got wrecked by us agricultural output (and internal mismanagement and fascist tendencies). American had undeveloped land, farms, factories, and dynamic intact work force and intact infastructure.  

 No one wants to overlook or minimize British/ Russian/Polish etc contributions to the war, but the hidden lead is American industrial might, agricultural production and logistics allowed the allies wage war across 2 oceans and replace losses at an astounding rate.

Honestly, if Japan won at midway and butler succeeded in barbosaa, it's still likely that while the war would have lasted longer America still had enough industrial capacity to over whelm the axis. 

Also, one has to wonder, if the war dragged on and the US was further from winning would we have used tactical nukes? Like instead of fighting for Iwo Jima just nuke the island? If Hitler succeeded in barbossa would we have nuked Hamburg or Berlin or German panzer divisions? One wonders if the axis was lucky to have lost when it did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even when senator and reps mean well, law is very complex and corporations basic help write these laws in areas they dominate, usually big companies. Politicians and their staffs are rarely scientists or economists etc... and since scientists and economists are ussually occupied with research or other work, they don't have time to argue and advocate bills. 

But large companies like Monsanto have lobbiests that help write the bill. Thats how liquid coal gets labeled a clean energy. It's how cms links hospital reimbursements to pain scores (opiates). It's how gm gets light rail torn up. 

Worse yet I keep hearing politicians clearly operating on some Econ 101 logic... talking about how clean energy is subsidized and how markets need to decide... wtf? Econ 102 would explain how fossil fuels produce pollution and that this is not factored into their cost as it is borne not by consumers directly so fossil fuels are cheaper than they should leading to over consumption... not to mention that supply and demand don't give a fuck about long term health and environmental outcomes as capitalism is a tool for efficient economic resource distribution,  not a value system or in anyway concerned with average Americans quality of life.

 Basically, congress is science and economics illiterate, big companies write bills and executive orders... coal can dump into streams, no CO2 regulation, fuck neutrality, health care is somehow supposed to work as some hybrid of public good and free market, opiates for everyone, cars and planes but no trains, weed for no one, and once you get caught with weed private prison for you, god forbid you regulate sugar, etc. </TEXT>

They might have to do a bit more legal work but there is no way they don't have some clause in the contract they can't use to get out of it. The NFL and patriots legal team will have no difficulty in a civil case proving Hernandez violated the terms of his contract.


Where things get more dicey is odin loyds family now has to prove a civil case against Hernandez' estate... they still will likely get it, burden of proof is less in a civil case, (preponderance of evidende, 50% probability vs beyond a reasonable doubt 95%) but they need to redominstrate proof Hernandez did it, and demonstrate damages, rather than just demonstrate damages alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having spent a decent amount of time in academia, I agree, women do get condescended too, hit on, and sometimes taken less than seriously. 

Although, professors and upper management some time condescend and talk down to everyone while appropriating ideas... it's a syndrome that often comes with being in power.

But it is frusturating when I hear colleagues complain that they are being mansplained to when in fact they are just wrong and someone was just trying to correct something... and I have often heard the term used to shut down discussions. 

Also, communication is important. I want to hear what the peope below me or above me think about a situation or idea or what lay people think... what is often ascribed as mansplaining is just people throwing out their theory or idea. If it's wrong? They should be corrected... it's now information gets exchanged... </TEXT>

We do know long term exercise is good for you. Long term cocaine causes plaque deposition, vasospasm etc. Caffeine in normal doses is not potent enough to cause long term adverse effects but in very high doses can be deadly. Nicotine has long term effects as well. Basically, some stress is fine, normal doses of caffeine is fine, exercise is good as long as you don't have underlying issues, healthy balanced diet with plants and fewer carbs is good, too much food is bad... these are not terribly controversial... </TEXT>

Also a marathon runner or athlete don't have hypertrophied hearts... if they do they need to detrain and likely have a cardiomyopathy... furthermore caffeine and nicotine in their broad effects also cause things like plaque deposition.

<TEXT> I enjoy that on this site conservatives and liberals interact. I think it strengthens us that people from different regions interact, domestically and internationally. If we had more female and more older users it would be good too but I think that will happen in time. 

We don't benefit from a small vocal minority aggressively using Reddit to spread misinformation and hate filled dogma from white supremacy to misogyny. The ability of the internet to deliver hateful dogma and recruit people to ideologically driven fringe causes is a huge threat of our time. 

In other Internet communities it is how a small group of radical Islamists can convince someone in Paris or San Bernindino or London to carry out a terrorist attack with minimal investment. It's how hate material makes it to a kid who is unhappy and shoots up a church in Atlanta. 

Diversity and free speech are vital to our Reddit community, and usually freedom is more valuable than security, but it is a balance. And it's unclear how we innoculate our popoulation against the influence of these fringe movements. 

I only brought up Reddit demographics becuase I believe, racism, mysogyny, alt right ideology to actually be a minority, although growing position in Reddit. And that we as a community need to find a way to provide our youngest and most vulnerable and angriest resistors context against some of these echo chambers and campaigns of racism, mysogny, etc... </TEXT>

<TEXT> what worries me is that the front page is largely videos and imgur photos, but, periodically, sometimes with some effort from the respective sub, some content will make it through to the front page, out of context, from some unreliable source. 

The concern is it an insidious way for the material to reach a broader audience, inocously mixed in with cat videos. And since early comments get upvoted the most, then hardcore users in these subs drive the top comments too.

So basically, you get users presented with a biased case, from a biased source, with biased comments masquerading as a legitimate story on a public forum (no immediately apparent political/corporate angle)... then people tell their friends, etc. Eventually, some story or some comment will debunk the claim/ story, but some fraction of those readers will stay and subscribe to that given reddit/ eco system.

<TEXT> Honestly, it is one of the reasons I don't really talk about Reddit, I pretend I barely know what it exists. 

For the lay public, reddit sometimes carries a less than desirable association with the alt right, PUA community, etc. even though the site is predominantly left-leaning, young over-educated tech savy users... lurkers, based on the people I know in real life who lurk, tend to be even more in that camp.

There are some out of mainstream threads specific to that demographic that can be problematic, and sometimes reddit can have a hive mentality that coupled with tech saviness can lead to problems... although conventional media campaigns like fox news gather the pitchfork calls have lead to far more problems imho.  

But generally, redditors tend to be more informed, non-violent, progressive than the public at large but a small vocal minority taints the site's reputation. Worse yet there is an element of reddit where alt right, neo-nazi, PUA types etc use reddit as a platform to exand to young tech savvy redditors to grow their numbers... so these elements are not simply an inconvenience to general reddit users but a cancerous growth...

The problem of how to address this without censorship that would degrade the sites primary function as a global internet forum and raise concerns as to who would vet the content and what is undesirable... The internet for all its good is also incredably effective at delivering toxic ideology to isolated angry youth, particularly young men... whether its ISIS, or its PUA, or its alt right. I think it is a question for our time as we struggle to share a national and global consensus on a factual base to help address pressing challenges of our time from global warming, to automation, to income inequality, to health care.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean here is an example where we simply don't know and people aren't willing to wait and find out more.  

Take your example:
1) Assad gets 70-80% in rigged elections, and definatelty not in the area he bombed. Sadaam used to get in the 90s. Also, remember assad controls all the media in the country. Honestly, it's a useless propoganda number.

2) Assad has gassed his own citizens before. He is also willing to drop barrel bombs on hospitals... repeatedly.

3) Chemical weapons are a red line. Why risk Russian backing but so clearly toeing that line especially since Russia was supposed to ensure he destroyed his chemical weapons.

4) Russia and assads protestations are weak, we saw the plane take off on satellite. Russia was also at that base. So they know as well. I believe Assad did this with Russian approval. If they hadn't Russia would just compellingly debunk US claims and embarras the shit out of US... after Iraq and wmd fiasco they would neuter our foreign policy credentials. Also china would have joined in as they have Syria interests too. 

5) But it makes little sense why Assad would for little tactical gain shoot himself in the foot like that by risking a US and European military response. I think he did it to test US reaponse because he is desperate and needs a final push to regain control. 
6) But why Russia allowed him or didn't just give him mor conventional support is what's interesting. The response was predictable, the US danced the expected dance. 

Meanwhilw, The strike on the base was limited. The Russian knew and left ahead of time so at the least the Syrians would see the Russians leaving and probably move assets out. When we say we destroyed x many planes, how many were even flyable. In return trump gets leverage on the Russian connection story. It's a limited US response and in Washington less heat on Russian election meddling and sou rectruitment... maybe they decided trump was too close appearing to them and too weak to lift sanctions now, so for now they decided some distance there.

Also, I think more importantly they established an international redline. Conventional explosives to kill babies? No intervention. Chemical weapons? Intervention. As long as Assad stays behind that line no western intervention.

Finally, Ukraine. If Russia does a false flag attack in Ukraine with chemical weapons in a couple months the US won't be able to say anything when a 1000 Russian tanks converge in Kiev.

No, I believe a Syrian plane dropped a chemical barrel bomb and I believe they bombed the hospital and then I believe Uncle Sam danced his tomhawk laden jig, and I believe that someone, probably in Moscow popped the champagne to celebrate how well they played us.

<TEXT> Also there is an added challenge. People don't like being wrong. Critical thinking is hard and unpleasant. People don't actually know how to do research or check sources. And many lack a knowledge base to ground their research. 

So instead they just find a media and craft a media environment for themselves that reflects their own beliefs... for the really lazy it's bouncing around "facts" in a face book echo chamber. 

The more inspired watch Fox News or Alex jones or dr oz and do cursory google searches and cherry pick results out that match their ideals. What's interesting is it isn't even hard because these movements develop their own terms that enrich google results. Google the term and after a few results you get the crazy pages. Worse yet add 

Macedonian fake news writers looking to make a buck or fringe sites looking to make a buck or state actors looking to push and agenda and there is polished shit out there for tha public to consume.

But the most determined are the conspiracy theorists who sit their and "research" or basically scour conjecture and loose association driven theories on fringe sites and buy books and videos produced by either the mentally ill or people looking to profit off of them.

But even in more main stream media with cuts to newsroom budgets there are misinformed lay articles in major newspapers. Any professional will tell you after reading an article about their field that it's more complicated than portrayed and information is not quite right.

Or take bill maher ranting about gmos without information... that's the other issue, we let opinion news amd news shows drive discussions... and what's is mahers credentials? Why does coultere opinion matter? Who are all these panelists on CNN? They tell us they are experts but who knows.

We have lost touch with that news is actually not always exciting. 

That facts can be complicated. 

It can take time to develop a clearer picture. 

What a lay person intuits isn't always right. 

That a lack of a shared civic platform and basic knowledge base is undermining the integrity of our country. 

Fractured media markets make consumers vulnerable to misinformation.

Non experts, opinion news shows, and entertainers are not an adequate source of news or thought leaders.

The combination of social media, consumer culture and cable news is toxic.

<TEXT> I am a space x fan and I honestly, don't understand the finer details of rocket/ rocket engine design but recognize how space X has pushed the envelope in commercial space flight. That being said, the future of Space X is by no means assured or certain. Furthermore, it is not clear to me the feasibility of the Mars ITS or if it is the correct way forward. Furthermore, space X's contribution seems to be the reusability and landing rockets, not so much engine or aerodynamics design. 

I guess my point is that space X is a start, that can still fail, is not necessarily the only, or correct way forward and has its own blind spots and limitations. I think its is important the public support multiple players in a field, and in particular, we need to push the government to continue to fund Nasa. Musk isn't funding climate change satellites or europa missions and I find it concerning that people are so ready to outsource the exploratory vision of a nation to a single or even a couple of billionaires.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's fine if grad school, internship, and jobs are infinite... also it degrades the value of your degree. If a company hires people with 3.75 GPAs who can't communicate in English or know the expected material it will hurt the value of your degree. Academic integrity is a thing for a reason and grades are as much an assessment of your knowledge for yourself as an external marker to future employers. Professors aren't detectives but they aren't your moral instructors or parents... it's not their job to teach you right and wrong you should have learned in middle school. Even in high school cheating should get you a 0 and in some places expulsion. His job is to teach and asses your knowledge.  Not be your sensei. It advanced education with adult learners... you don't know shit then it's your job to figure out how to remedy that... cheating is a non option.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When applied to Newell or Musk it's with grudging respect... joking but a suggestion to the sway they hold among certain interest circles... particularly Newell in his control of steam (and steam sales) and half life 3 release (or non release). 

With trump I can see that idea of a fascist leader bringing society back from the brink and self destruction appealing to a certain sect of Trump supporters... if you believe Trump is playing 4 moves ahead and restoring American greatness from the threat or immigrant/liberal/feminist/minority one can see how that appeals to that minority....

Others on the other side use it ironically because they suggest trump is anything but in control or ahead but are concerned about the other side of the coin in his percieved fascist tendencies and self love. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am singling out how this situation was handled and the ceos tone deaf response that cost them stock price and brand image. 1st rule of dealing with any kind of client issue or pr issue is a sincere apology... you don't even have to admit guilt or liability... just an apology and a promise to address the situation. When you make more than 100x your average employee or the average American you don't get to make fuck ups like his... literally the worst feasible tweet he could have sent... show he clearly doesn't care about the little people... what a fuck...

Also, why is the link wrong, lines up with most of what I read regarding this situation... 

Furthermore, my experience lines up with United performance in surveys... shitty service, indifference to passengers, crappy inflight experience... will pay more to fly other airlines, they are the last I search.

They took US bailout, cut pensions, now when times are good still treat consumers like shit and clearly their CEO doesn't care about "reacomidating" the little people. What is the doc doing his transplant has been reaccomidated? First class passengers aren't he only ones with places to be. </TEXT>

People get nickel and dimed for everything, fucked with change fees, and after spending a sizable amount of money not even guaranteed a place on the plane. People risk losing out on vacation or in this instance important work... add insult to injury it was employees and no another passenger. People's rage boiled over and they want pitch forks out and heads to roll. These fucking airlines get government bailouts in bad times and treat customers like shit in good times.

So is this more important than Syrian children, global warming, the nuclear option for scotus nominees, etc? No, but people feel like they can relate to this, are upset and angry with airlines and feel as consumers they can make a difference. 

So fuck united... an airline that despite not being particularly cheap, still fails to meet the very low basic expectations set by the American consumer base long accustomed to shitty treatment from airlines... </TEXT>

<TEXT> YouTube didn't even censor it. It's restricted under an opt in used for parental controls and probably insitutions like schools. 

Furthermore, maybe it's time people realized corporations aren't benevolent bodies... they have one mission, they are obligated, legally, and incentivized to maximize near term profits to maximize investor wealth. And since dividends aren't the main source of income from stocks, it's really about maximizing stock price. 

And our morals and sensibilities are limited to the collective willingness of us as consumers to boycott the convenience of a site like YouTube.

And, we must not forget, Scotus affirmed the rights to free speech of corporations so YouTube can pull and censor videos all it wants...

And if net neutrality gets fucked by this republican congress, your ISPs will start defecto sensoring content... good luck with that.

This is why regulations exist. Free markets don't always yield socially optimal outcomes. If it benefits companies in the near term to poison a river, especially if their customers aren't effected and they will be gone by the time the need to clean up? They will poison said river. Coal companies don't care about mercury emission or climate change. Oil companies only care about spills as lost oil... unless they are threatened with fines. If companies maximize profits in the near term by paying sub livable wage? They will do so. 

All sorts of negative externalities in markets exist when societal costs aren't proved into the good. Free markets are an effiecnt way to organize resources in the near term, but they don't have inherent values or principles... they are a tool that need scare and adjustment.

Idk how you fix YouTube free speech, but if the corporations buying add space feels they want this and American consumers are apathetic... then this will fly.

Also, don't forget, a lot of those future and current consumers are liberal, young people who feel alienated from the people on this sub and generally support sensible gun control... so they aren't going to care or support you on this unless you find a way to speak to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kushner is Jewish. Whatever his feelings on communism - probably not very warm - I doubt he has warm feelings about the Nazis or other Belarussians for the matter. Eastern European Jews (with Ukrainian Odessa Jews being the exception) don't really identify as Belarusian or Polish or Russian but Jews because they were ostracized and limited to ghettos by czarist governments. Periodically murdered in pogroms.

Odessa Jews, Odessa being the cultural center of Eastern European Jewish culture and wealth identified slightly separately from the bulk of Jews in the Pale.

Jews in former Austria Hungary and Germany were culturally distinct enjoying more integration, freedom and economic/educational opportunities.

The Kushners are corrupt, kushner is amateur hour, and his actions are dubious but he is a) not a neonazi, probably opposed bannons alt right b) not pro Russia ideologically. However, Russia is antisemtic as fuck and don't consider kushner as truly Russian. Idk what ties trump and Kushner have with Russia but money, compromising materials, shady business deals are more likely to be the driver of the Russia/ Trump connection than ideology.

Kushner is a crook looking to make a buck and get some power... now flynn? Money or ideology? Unclear. Sessions? Who knows his motivation. Mannefort? Probably money.  </TEXT>

However, to think that we are going to feed 7 billion and growing with small scale agriculture and heirloom varieties is insane and misses the challenges of large scale food production and distribution. 

Mainting varieties of agricultural products is vital for tweaking existing large scale production to tweak flavor profiles, drought resistance, disease resistance etc... biodiversity matters. But we don't have the land, resources or climate to allow everyone to eat small scale locally produced heirloom produce and meat. </TEXT>

2) Russia knows it will be a limited attack and long term knows it can wait out the storm.
3) Weeks or months from now chemical attack in East Ukraine. Russia states red line was breached. Russian tanks poor into Ukraine.

Or 

Russia is using Syria to test weapons. Invites US retaliation so S400 middle system tests radar against real US tomahawk attack.

Or 

No chemical attack, US defense contractors want $70 million in missle orders.

<TEXT> I think it's patronizing but to suggest that people who are already deeply suffering and have high rates of morbidity from suicide to sexual assault that they are being fed some rosy picture of their reality. There is some stupidity where this is taken too far and people identify as a cat or a pony... there is no biological way or reason that could happen, but gender makes sense that sometimes either epigenticallty or some other mechanism might cause misimprinting of gender. 

If someone identifies as another gender why can't there be some no fuss way of letting them live that life. Fuck even Iran allows for and supports gender reassignment surgery because they recognize it's a part of who someone is... let that sink in for a second, sharia law Iran. It's done without hoopla, they have a medical panel exam the applicant, determine its not a whim and a real medical needs, and then allow them to undergo plastic surgery and change their paperwork...

No one chooses to be a gay and not one chooses to be trans... if you are a straight man you generally never thought about fucking a dude, it never occurred to you. One day when you were going through puberty you suddenly noticed you wanted to have sex with females... like honestly for a bit of time until your hormones come in check that's almost all you wanted to do. Similiary you never once looked at women and felt like you were one of them... 

This idea that if we allow trans people to live normal lives out as their gender identity that there will be some epidemic and there simply won't be.. no more than normalizing homosexuality changed the fact that 5% of the popoulation is gay. Being trans comes with its own challenges. It's hard to find partners. The transition is at best good enough and there are social and biological complications. If we normalize this it's not going to do anything other than allow trans people to live their lives as they want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, it is because people have mutually agreed to a system driven by rule of law which is the core tenant of our constitution. Application of law, which is written by fallible men, to complex situations is messy so we have agreed that the courts will be arbiters of this law. The police generally serve to enforce the law. And while we have issues in America with police behavior (say civil forfeiture), generally America is governed by the rule of law. Obviously its more complex than that, but at its base we mostly generally agree that we want disputes settled in accordance to the law by the judicial system because its the best way to protect our basic rights, our property and provide for a stable functioning society. Most people don't want Somalia... now that is a place ruled by men with guns... </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You omitted the analogy of career vs friends. No analogy is perfect. The basic tenant is delayed gratification and investment in a cause that yields a long term return. It is human to develop feelings of closeness and intamacy with others as you go through life but there are healthy ways to channel that to friendship or to address those situations before they become an issue. Otherwise, no relationship will survive difficult times and really those are when relationships really come to matter...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk, all day long people have urges to do things that are not good for them... you get angry driving home because some truck with truck nuts coal rolled you... you have the urge do harm to their car and or them but you don't because you recognize the need to be a part of a functional society and don't want to ruin your own life to teach that attention seeking asshole a lesson.

Or a better example you might want to eat only bacon but recognize you are want health and longevity and in the long run it makes you happier to forgo that junk food today. Or you might want to hang out with your friends but you work long hours because ultimately you find your career choice fulfilling and want to excel at it.

Life is about choices. Investment in a meaningful mongongamous relationship has an opportunity cost in missing out on flirtation and new relationships but when it's good has unique worth in a deep kind of love and support born out of years shared difficulty, joy and investment into the relationship. 

Ultimately, one also might wonder if you mistake friendship and familiarity for sexual attraction... you can be drawn to people and form friendships without giving into the sexual attraction part... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, it seems like the real conspiracy is missed in the discussions of building 7 or debris patterns. 

Basically, an organization (al quada) formerly funded by the US, now fund by Saudi Arabia (a US ally) had 19 men (largely from Saudi Arabia) plow a plane into US buildings. 

Saudi Arbaian leadership had ties with the Bush administration. They were never held accountable for their actions. Instead, the US invaded Afghanistan (not totally unreasonably), but then proceeded to invade Iraq... based on fake claims and based on unsubstantiated intel...

When an ambassador wrote a white paper debunking those claims, Cheney and company outed his wife as a CIA operative.

We then invaded Iraq, using contractors associated with the administration where billions were unaccounted for...

There are tons of conspiracies there, and most don't have to do with free fall or debris patterns... but yet no one here is interested...

I mean fuck, cheney and libby commited treason outing Plame... they invented a causus belle in wmd and yellow cake and their friends got rich while they maimed ans killed 10s of thousands of US soldiers, 100,000s of iraqis... and they also suspended our civil liberties in the process, the media failed, and Saudi Arabia got off scott free and even benefited to have Iraq, one of their geopolitical opponents destroyed...

Even now Saudi Arabia is agitating against the Iran deal because Iran is a geopolitical foe...

The conspiracy is Saudi Arbaian involvement in US foreign policy...  </TEXT>

And while you are correct, anti smoking ad campaigns are good (although even good public awareness efforts can have bad outcomes), I am not certain this video is particularly good for anyone... it does not make people educated media consumers, or help people understand the nuances of government/ media interaction... it just dogmatically labels government/corporations as evil and bad.

<TEXT> Yeah, so no. DT happens because alcohol stimulates your GABA system. If your are constantly drunk, your brain responds by down regulating GABA. This takes about 2 weeks, longer in naive drinkers, shorter in alcoholics. Withdrawal is when you take away the alcohol this down regulated system all of a sudden is understimulated and you get symptoms. Since gaba is responsible for the downer parts of your brain, not enough GABA results in over stimulation... so tremor, hallucinations, seizures. You can withdraw while drinking because for people who are constantly very drunk, if they get used to a BAC of 300 they might withdraw when the start to get below 100. Basically they aren't drinking fast enough or strong enough alcohol... there also seems to be a wind up aspect where if you get behind and the excitatory symptoms are out of control, you might need more than usual gaba targeting substances to get the symptoms under control. </TEXT>

Also, the missing a heart beat, alcohol can definately give you arrhythmias of variable forms... so your heart might have been racing, or skipping beats or had irregular beats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with regular heavy drinking, even if less than the professional alcoholics (when your alcohol intake can reasonably be measured in liters hard alcohol or 30 racks of beer per day) can progress to heavier drinking over time, particularly in settings of increased stress. 

Heavy drinking isn't healthy, it's expensive, and make you feel crappier and less mentally sharp, so good on you for cutting back... 1-2 drinks for a man daily is probably ok... but more than that it's time to reconsider alcohol in your life... </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's variable by person, and also duration for drinking and amount really matters. For people drinking 1-2L of hard alcohol daily, bad withdrawal is more likely but even people who drink less can get bad withdrawal too. 

Some people wake up and have to drink first thing in the morning because they are already tremelous. Also if you withdrew in the past and had seizures or complications it means your are likely to do so in the future. 

People are complicated though... it's hard to predict.  </TEXT>

Your response is muddled, draws odd comparisons and examples, and has what seems to be your application and intuition mixed with some basic underlying fact... which unfortunately in science is often wrong. The question itself is rather vague and general which makes it hard to answer. Muscles are one part, neurological development and brain size is another (both for processing inputs and motor control), selective pressure is a third, and mass to size ration, cardiac output, warm blooded vs cold blooded etc etc... and these factors vary depending on the ecological niche occupied by a given animal.

His criticism of the NYT? I get his attention to it
- it's a national Newspaper, although why he singles it out more than say the Washington Post is Washington Post or WSJ (after that recent editorial) is unclear.

Also, why is he so caught up in what stars say about him, like at he golden globes? It's not like many of his supporters, or anyone else really watch the golden globes or care very much about Meryl Streep a musings on the contributions of a few immigrant starlets to Hollywood.

<TEXT> Trump isn't actually interested in legislating a conservative agenda... he wants popularity and approval. And while I used to think it was popoularity in national polls, I am increasingly starting to think he wants approval and popoularity among the national elite, particularly the New
York elite. That's why he is so fixated on SNL... Maher and other comedians go after him but SNL really grinds his gears... because he probably watched it and it's a NY institution. Same with the NYT... So he blows his capital fighting those fights instead of advancing a conservative agenda he does not understand. 

Meanwhile, Ryan is not charismatic or skilled enough to lead and unite the republican house and, despite media claims to his wonkishness, not smart enough to craft bills that intelligently and functionally lead to effective and good governance along conservative principles.

The republicans have seized all the levers of governance only to realize they have lost the visionary, imaginative and intellectual parts of their party along the way and have not actual clue how to govern or achieve the promises and principles they ran on.

Ryan's healthcare bill is was terrible. It cut care, cost more in the long run, and didn't make the healthcare marketplace any more open or competitive. The dems didn't like it because it threatened coverage for poor people, republicans didn't like it because it didn't save money, and hard core conservatives didn't like that it didn't really roll back all that much of the ACA. The bill had nothing good for anyone... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want him to answer or stand trial... trials serve many reasons. For civil cases it is about offering restitution to an injured party (both in the tacit acknowledgment of wrongdoing and the monetary award). 

But in my opinion criminal proceedings are not for the victim, or for their families or interested parties. They are for the state... to enforce the laws that govern a functional society. 

Bannon's trial won't fix the damage him and the Trump administration has already wrought to the credibility and function of our executive branch. Nor reverse the hate he has unearthed, nurtured and fanned. But, if he is shown to have had committed treason or some other infraction, his trial would serve as a record of his doings and his punishment would be a reaffirmation of the functioning of government and rule of law. 

If he commits suicide, it leaves him a mystical nexus for the conspiracy theorists and the fringe to spin their own narrative. We have found that bringing hate to the light can be dangerous because if it hasa critical mass its starts to thrive in the open... 

But I do beleive that Americans are still law abiding and retain some civic grounding and that treason, collusion with foreign governments and duping the American public will be universally rejected. And, if done right, may serve as a bipartisan nexus to recover from this collapse of American political insitutions... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nixon was a paranoid sociopath... who opened up China... but along with Kissinger also tried to sabatoge Vietnam peace talks for personal gain... brilliant but ethically challenged. Reasonable that later presidents saw him as a sounding board... hopefully not for ethical dilemmas though.

<TEXT> It's not, but transgender people identify as the opposite from their biological sex. It's different from body dysmorhia because after a sex change they are happy and feel more comfortable with improvement in outcomes... less likely to have dysphoria, depression, suicidality. 

But there are limits and sports falls at the limit.... having MTF compete in women's categories is simply an unfair advantage and breaks the sport. Also, for ftm if they are taking steroids and other meds that are banned as PEDs they also shouldn't be allowed to compete. 

It's tricky because inhalers for asthma are also PEDs but the meds in ftm like testosterone are clearly more problematic from a PED standpoint. 

Again, we can respect the medical needs of the transgender population while recognizing reasonable limits...

Edit: literature on the subject is murky. A brief look suggests while dysphiria improves a Swedish stufy in 2011 showed possibly worse outcomes for mortality and suicide... however sub group analysis of more recent reassignments 1989 to current shows similiar mortality/suicide rates to the general popoukace...  basically gender reassignment is one piece of the puzzle...which makes sense given that trans youth tend to be at risk for all sorts of social issues like sexual assault and homelessness and discrimination. Gender reassignment does not tux that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again all gross simplifications, tesla did not invent AC poet or remote control... although he was a pioneer involved in their development and while Westinghouse did utilize teslas ac motor other people came onto those designs as well. Tesla was brilliant and ahead of his time but he is not the only, and probably not even the most important overlooked scientist or inventor. 

People like teslas mad scientist story and the mystique surrounding him but his isolated contribution to science is often overblown... this was a time of immense rapid progress at the height of the Industrial Age... people were racing for firsts... because ideas were floating around and the environment is as ripe for invocation. Tesla was an prominent part of that age but Bell and Edison are the only ones demented... partially likely because they had massive companies bearing their names... tesla died a pauper... that's probably a big party of the legacy thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing I refuse to underestimate is humanities pennant for slaughtering other humans and if really struggle to belief that given the opportunity to harness the earths magnetic field for large scale energy generation the major militaries of the past century would have done so... not to mention that the USSR would have missed this opportunity to show up the capabilist West. 

I just don't see energy starved Imperoal Japan or Nazi germany from ignoring this tech... Later nuclear subs sent the Cold War into another level because nuclear subs were not behoven to refueling stops and could not be tracked. Soviets experimented with high risk molten sodium reactors. Even today american logistical support for war making is what makes us the only true power capable of force projection and even that is vulnerable to new long range missles that threatens our airlift and sealift capability... I find it hard to believe our military would overlook the ability to leave the constraints of fuel behind...

Tesla is not remembered because curriculums and text books have limited space and Edison was a skill d inventor and self promoter... also tesla was less skilled on delivering finished goods and made less of a direct impact. Also, he didn't exactly publish science papers or rigourlsy test his discoveries.

Most Americans maybe hear about bell, rarely marconi or other contemporary inventors. Kind of like we remember Eli Whitney as cotton gin inventor and slater for bringing the industrial revolution... these people become simplified stand ins for entire eras of scientific acomplishment. In general our history overlooks the contribution of scientists in favor of lawyers and politicians...

<TEXT> Honestly, energy is a prime component of the logistics of conducting warfare. And if people thought they could power their war machines with wireless free energy... well we would have seen World War II and then Cold War era utilization of the technology. 

Simply given that logistics is the Achilles heal of any army and the amount of resources and lives devoted to protecting fuel conveys and supply missions I just don't see such tech being overlooked in soviet or American plans for WWIII and such would expect to have seen said technology deployed in Cold War Germany, the DMZ, and other anticipated fault lines or in hot conflicts like Vietnam. 

Also don't see the fuel starved Nazis ignoring this during WWII. Also don't see Israel with a small territory to defend and also import fuel dependence overlooking such tech either....

America is currently the only nation that can project its forces in any meaningful way and even then is really exposed if the enemy can target US airlift, sealift, aerial refueling capability. Other countries simply don't even have those capabilities to begin with. So you believe everyone is voluntarily hamstringing their abilities to humor big oil? Do people really think Russia but molten sodium cooled reactors on fast attack subs that could never be turned off if they had other options? </TEXT>

<TEXT> And different states use their resources differently. 

Israel has a smaller elite team that develops really high end multiple exploit attacks like stuxnet. Israel like their assasinations doesn't leave fingerprints and denies it if they do. Precision is the game. That's why the US paid heir firm to hack the bernidino iPhone. Mystery, surgical precision, innovation... that's their fingerprint. Stuxnet was a technical marvel, US resources (they tested on a mock up centerfuge built in US desert) and Israel tech and intelligence (5 new exploits, has a targeting mechanism for specific simiens centrifuges, secretly attached itself to USB drives to get to offline system).

China goes after industrial and government data and secrets... if they steal political info they don't share it. They wouldn't mess with US politics because that could invite the US to do the same. Also, Chinese aren't a sophisticated in the misinformation game.

Russia... we know they have teams of everything from elite hackers all the way down to paid posters on comment sites on domestic and western web sites. I wouldn't be surprised if they let hackers operate from their territory in return for state sponsored work/ sharing info kind of like the british let drake raid Spanish gold ships... also this political destabilization and misinformation is a a GRU favorite going back to before WWII... the russian conventional forces might be a shadow of soviet might but their special forces and propoganda units are in fine form... Crimea is an example of propoganda, undercover cells, followed by special forces and then conventional forces. The article attack required huge resources, a propoganda/misinformation unit, the motive, and political backing... if the shoe fits...

<TEXT> This is what was so upsetting about this election. 

Yes, Hilary has her flaws and has her demons. Her campaign was sometimes too insular, too aggressive about trying to control the narrative. They reacted badly to minor scandals and missed the boat on the economy. They tried to hang the election on Trump being despicable and it turned out not to matter to many voters who were concerned with their own short-term economic well-being. 

But, even many democrats bought into lies and the fox news/ republican generated narrative about her being a liar, about her being out for herself. Benghazi never got anywhere except to create a narrative of untrustworthiness. The emails showed the realisitic working of a stateswoman committed to her job but it got spun as being two faced. The home server was a problem, but many politicians have resorted to private email because of limitations of government email incuding her predescors.

And so all the while, even liberals who voted for her would grumble about how they were picking the better of two evils, or how she was slightly better... when her opposition was acutally corrupt, was actually unqualified, was a relentless liar, actually hides business dealings etc.... meanwhile Hilary, while too pro wall street and corprotist, too supply side, nevertheless planned to raise the minimum wage, had policies for everything for family leave to syria ready to go... etc.

We all bought into this smear campaign agaisnt hilary and we now are going to pay the price. It is time we support our press but demand from them accoutnability and better communication. It is time we start to build a shared platform of facts which the right and left agree upon so that we can then build consensus policy from that platform... 

Till then feelings will rule the roost, and when people let feeligs dictate votes they are suseptable to con men like trump and smear campaigns like swift boat and the anti hilary hit job... </TEXT>

<TEXT> The science of zyklon b wasn't complex or ground breaking than the experiments mengele conducted had scientific merit - which is to say non or little. The industrial infrastructure was unique only in its application to murdering humans. 

Eugenics was a fashionable topic among educated westerners but it wasn't based in anymore sound science than other Nazi beliefs like Nazi understandings of race or even history. The lesson of the dangers of nazism was not the dangers of science, but rather the dangers of pseudoscience and propoganda. I don't see nazism as the out growth of the heady early days of modern science...

It was an exercise in modern propoganda,  nationalism, pseudo scientific race theory.... it was the use of false pseudoscience to sell racial biases and dehumanizes fellow humans. 

There is a difference between Nazi undertakings and homophobia or racism in the US. There is difference between action t4 and US sterilization programs. And there is a difference between the work of mengele and the Tuskegee experiments. 

The difference is intent, scale and ferocity... don't get me wrong, America and the west have their own sins. Belgium maimed and slaughtered the Congo. The Americans slaughtered and robbed the native Americans, enslaved and subjugated Africans. The English have more than a few sins of colonilaism under their belt. 

But never did they succumb to a drive to exterminate races and countries and classes of people or see them as not human...

It is important to remember that science and economics are but tools of a society to answer questions but themselves do not impart values or reason... they are, in a functional republic, best used in service to the elightenment principles of modern society. 

It is important to recognize the Nazi regime as not one of mad science but of pseudo science mated with propoganda in the service of a cult... Nazi understanding of race was outdated even by 1940s standards and their understanding of history was also based in myth... we must be suspicious whenever science is used to push or define ethics, or values the same way we must be suspicious when economics becomes a means onto itself.

It is the institutions of rule of law, codes defining civil rights, the free press, functional education system, separation of church and state, checks and balances, free elections, etc are so important. They are what help define the needs and questions science and economics can answer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And it was wrong. It is important to recognize and understand that social mores and ethics evolve over time, often to reflect social needs as well as our evolving understanding of science and humanity. 

But what the germans did was unique and special in the annals of atrocities. Salin murdered millions and so did Mao. There were contemporaries of Hitler who were as cruel and oppressive. But the difference is they murdered for political ideology, or out of mismanagement of resources etc. Stalin went after Jews. Mao annexed Tibet and persecuted monks. Even the Japanese, who raped and pillaged across Asia, who conducted biochemical weapons tests on Chinese cities, who also exhibited wanton cruelty and violence towards those they occupied, never quite reached Nazi level plans for extermination, murder and torture. 

Hitler industrially murdered his own and neighboring peoples because he felt them to be subhuman. He intentionally drew up plans to murder 100s of millions. To wipe out countries, cultures, and people. His regime medically experimented on its victims on a wide scale with wanton cruelty. They created factories to murder people. It was cold, calculated, and planned atrocity powered by early computers and the industrial revolution.

But what is important to remember is that they were in the minority and that there was at the least acquiescence and likely broad support for the general plans and policies of the nazi regime if not for the practical details of what went on in concentration camps and battlefields.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure antisemtism was not unique to Germany, and murdering Jews was not unique either. But German plans for extermination of the Jews and also for colonization of Eastern Europe, displacement of entire countries and atrocities was unique to Germany and Japan in the modern era. 

Stalin for all the horrors and murder he did was not seeking to exterminate and replace entire popoulations. 

Nazi germany divided the races and saw much of humanity as sub human and therefore ok to exterminate or enslave. And Nazi propoganda and tenants were pretty clear on that count. 

To suggest th German people had no knowledge of what we happening or weren't at least passively complicit is a rewriting of history.

The German soldiers spearheading tank divisions across western Europe and slaughtering everything along Eastern Europe were not fighting a defensive war. They were conquering territory and people to be remade along the Nazi model and that meant the slaughter of Jews and later the slavs... followed by the subjugation of the French and English... the concentration camps were developed when it became clear that having frontline German divisions shoot Jews was costly and taking its toll on german soldiers. Extermination camps for Jews were to trial the technology to wipe out the majority of Eastern Europeans. The holocaust was the warm up act...

There were 3000 concentration camps in Germany. Jews vanished from the popoulation. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers participated in either burning village in Eastern Europe and shooting Jews to runninga concentration camps... box cars of people vanished into the east... the German knew on some level what was happening if not exact details. 

I do not say this to suggest that Germans are somehow fundamentally morally deficient as a people, but as a case study of what humanity can do when it acquiesces to authoritarianism, nationalism and racial division... 

When you define the other as subhuman, when you get caught up in the perceived collective greatness of your own, when you let propoganda dictate your reality, when you let fear drive policy and when you allow dissent to be suppressed you can put entire societies at risk for collective madness... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess, recordings and transcripts of german soldiers from POW camps suggest more than a passing level of anti-Semitism and commitment to the Nazi mission. Remember, many of these 18-24-year-olds had spent the formative years of their life, really their entire teens, under nazi propaganda... this hearkens of the clean wehrmacht myth and really, in my opinion, misses the most chilling lesson of WWII regarding the banality of evil. 

And while this phrase, coined about eichman, missed eichman's chillingly unrepentant sociopathy, it is a useful way of understanding that a relatively modern western nation, through the exploitation of existing racial biasis and divisions, nationalism, propaganda, with some facilitating socio-economic factors, can become a machine which conducts the slaughter of their own and neighboring peoples on an industrial scale.

These soldiers aren't defending the river rhine, they are defending the beaches of normandy and conquered french territory, in the same way that they burned and murdered entire russian villages and shot and rounded up entire cities of Jews.

Nazi propaganda was about granting Germans living space... the Germans knew this, it was outlined in mein kampf and called for at the least displacement of 100s of millions and in practice the murder of those people. The holocaust was the warm up act. 

To pretend that the german soldiers were some average joes protecting their homes misses the point... a point that should be a sobering reminder about the dangers of unchecked propaganda, flaming sectarian and racial divides, and dismantling the institutions of government/democracy/free press etc...

These are mainly articles about leadership being bugged, don't remember where its was about rank and file POWs...

<TEXT> Multiple pronged approach:

1) Pathway to citizenship for those here who have been lawfully abiding, non-violent citizens, particularly dreamers.. including probationary period etc. and some fee/ back tax.

2) National employment verification system, if you cannot earn money, you won't come here. Punishment for employers clearly violating system, including jail time and penalties. Companies employing illegal immigrants can risk losing eligibility for government contracts.

3) A system for tracking those who overstay visas, new rules going forward regarding overstaying visas and ban for future eligibility for citzenship x 10 years (or something like that).

4) Reassessment of the quotas/ how our immigration system works. H1, J1, guest worker programs etc. 

5) Engagement of latin america in further bilateral trade agreemens and support of democratically elected governments and forces in Latin America (better conditions in Latin America = less incentive for immigration while better US trading partner and market for US goods). 

6) End war on drugs, sensible drug policy, Marijuana legalization to starve latin american gangs of money... less gang violence in hondrus and mexico = less drive for immigration. Investment in drug programs in use to treat addicts/ social interventions to decrease drug demand. Better controls on money and guns flowing south.  </TEXT>

Disagree with me in whatever capacity you want but what do you propose as a solution? 

A big wall to stop the airplanes from landing? Send teams to round people up and deport them? 

Btw, we know rounding up prostitutes does not lower the prostitution rate, just pushes them into the shadows, desperate  people will do what pays... but rounding up pimps and johns helps.

<TEXT> Well it's complicated... 

1) the parents... they are looking for a better life for their kids, sometimes this is the only chance of that. They broke law, true, but they have been here for a decade. If they are law abiding social economiclly contributing people while they be sent back? Maybe... there are a lot of considerations, like will they be murdered or jailed in their home country or will they simply be poor. But also, what about their children?

2) The children... well this has parts a and b.
a) Brought as children, also illegals but did they have the capacity or agency to decide their own fate? They grew up here, they can't function in their home country, should they be punished for their parents sins?
b) kids born here, American citizens, in sending their parents back you hurt them and they are American citizens and I guess the government should work to protect their interests too... they are here to stay so don't we want them have stable secure upbringings so later they are functional members of society.

At the end of the day, this issue requires some pragmatism.... and black and white, this is wrong and his is right is not helpful in untangling a complex mess. Deporting any large fraction of these people will be enormousness costly and destabilizing to entire cities and communities and the economy... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess, maybe if we had sensible immigration policies and a different reality on the ground... but what you have is 11 million undocumented migrants, around 50% of whom who landed in airports and overstayed their visas. 

Deporting them would be grossly destabilizing to businesses. 

They have children who are US citizens and stranding those kids would also hurt the economy. 

Some of them came as children with no knowledge of what they were doing and grew up in America so have not experience or ability to survive in their "home countries". 

This situation is clearly complex. Meanwhile, they live here, are victims of crimes, drive, function in society, etc... and aggressively going after them pushes them further into shadows leading to abuses, crimes, and further depresses wages. 

Maybe I was flippant about the fruit, but the black and white, they broke a law, woe to them, lets shit on them as humans and deport them to countries with socio-economic instability whose language they don't speak is not a solution either. 

Or what is your solution, round up 11 million, send em back, build a wall and hope for the best? Does anyone think that will actually end well? </TEXT>

They still want a functioning society and will compromise... and have some reasonable policy proposals. In a balanced govenment they are part of the the balance.

Strict conservatives like Cruz are scarier, no compromise on spending and no compromise on social agenda. They are aggressive, ideologues, but in the end still believe in basic laws and structures of government and generally accept all Americans as people... 

Bannon and company are fascist... with an ideology beyond government size or function but goes after the heart of what government is and can do. For them the ends justify the means. The only truth is their own, and they really don't see many Americans as Americans...

That is scary... the first two actually have a place on government as they represent an approach to governance... the last one does not because it truly seeks to undermine the principles of rule of law and personal freedoms while destroying the organs and institutions of democracy if society.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree, education needs to teach 4 fundamental skills, reading comprehension, writing (vocabulary, grammar, attention structure), empirical thought (scientific method, probability, supporting your argument), mathematics. 

These are unpleasant to learn simply because they require a type of thought that is not intuitive. It's a reprogramming of the brain that allows for more complex thought and allows functioning in modern complex jobs. It will require painful, rote learning... memorizing vocabulary, memorizing grammar, practicing writing, memorizing foundational math principles, reading boring passages and extracting info, doing repetitive physics and science problems. It sucks but it lays the foundation for future awesome endeavors like programming, science research, medicine etc..

Then schools need to teach additional things that benefit society by creating a common value system: civics, history, economics,  etc...

The problem in American schools is not breadth but that it graduates utterly lack concrete skills... suffer from lack of reading, writing and mathematics ability... no clue or skills to undertake self directed learning and no understanding of the rigour and approach to learning complex skills.

Problem is those  are the jobs that need workers and pay well. We have a plethora of grads with broad educations and no concrete skills...

<TEXT> Hilary wasn't planning war. Her released emails as SOS and her promises to continue Obamas polices suggest war unlikely. She was a dedicated diplomat. 

Moreover, who would she invade? Drone strikes she would likely continue as well as special forces ops, but there was never any suggestion of Hilary invading Iran and the idea that she was out to start war with Russia was fantastical.

Meanwhile trump has no clue what he is doing, is alienating allies, and picking fights and likely looking for a reason to further ban immigration. He is as likely to start war of on accident as he is to start war because of ego or incompetence. 

Hilary was a stateswoman regsrdless of her other draw backs. Trump has no concept of statesmanship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The part I love about trumps oil commentary is the logistics of his proposals...how does he propose we take iraqs oil? Does he imagine that we can just rapidly extract billions of barrels from multiple under developed and neglected oil fields in insurgency contested areas and bring it out in trucks and then ship it out? Does he understand the logistics of such a task and where would we even store those billions of barrels... it's like he has no concept of reality... </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Democratic Party wants to offer things that will help people who don't have wealthy to catch up... 

1) Bernie wanted free college education - I don't agree but it was an idea. In any case democrats want to improve public education. Republicans have a reasonable point in that teachers unions can be obstacles to change. Dems are also less into teacher accountability (not good). In any case the ideal would be every child gets some baseline standard meaningful education... we can debate how. Betsy Davos and her commitment to faith based learning and anti public education is not going to be helpful. Basically the vast majority of Americans cannot write, cannot do math or program at the levels necessary for competitiveness in the modern workforce.

2) minimum wage. Dems want people at the bottom some guaranteed minimum living wage that profitable corporations can afford. Simply while people are retraining or looking to expand their career or just trying to survive this will make a big difference to working class people.

3) health care. If you are not healthy you can't retrain or work or function and with the risk of healthcare costs over people heads it's a problem. Furthermore it stifles entrepreneurship because people need to stay employed by a large corporation to maintain h with insurance for themselves and families. Shitty and no insurance gets in the way of people getting the care they need so they can function. We need to join every other developed nation with some kind of universal health care, or at least keep improving obama care. The republicans are out to screw poor people on health care... the republican debate audience recently applauded that if people can't pay they should die in the streets.

4) income inequality. The wealthy stay wealthy because per the recent book by Thomas Pikketty RG, or capital grows faster than wages. US wages are stagnant, wage laborers have been shafted. Increasing income inequality kills social mobility, poor kids can't compete. Add in the erosion of public supports like insurance, education etc and the poor are screwed.

5) globalization is irreversible, things are too interconnected, it's too profitable and too effective. Any country not partaking will fall behind. Out capitalist economy and modern consumptive life style can't handle isolation. But their will be winners and losers. In the 90s and 00s no body wanted to help the losers, and they are now angry. They were also promised their jobs and prominence back by successive republican campaigns... it hasn't and won't happen. They need retraining programs but also to accept reality.

 6) infrastructure spending. We  need need to all the belief that we are ever on war footing. We need a smaller and leaner military and the industrial complex is out of control. Instead we need investment in civilian infrastructure... high speed internet, alternative energy, modern smart grid, high speed rail, better roads, etc... the foundations of a modern economy. No one expects roads or airports or sports stadiums to pay for themselves, why are other projects helps to the standard... like public transport. The poor and elederlt are tied to their cars which cost a huge part of their income, if they lose their license that are screed, and if there is an accident the liability is huge. We need better infrastructure that helps the poor, creates blue collar jobs, stimulates the economy... 

7) global warming warming... should be #1, but it's the republicans maybe can start by acknowledging it's a thing.

Etc, etc.... the dems have strong plans for all these issues, some republicans do too, there is room on these issues for a balance of progressive and conservative approaches...

Trump meanwhile is busy repealing laws banning oil companies from bribing foreign powers, coal comlanies from polluting streams, pointless orders against refugees, repealing obama care and appointing a cabinet of billionaires, oil and finance tycoons and military folks late of the military industrial complex to his cabinet. He is degrading the institutions of truth, the media, rule of Law etc...

Meanwhile, rust belt and southern voters think their coal and factory jobs are going to magically come back... in the meanwhile all solar manufacture has gone to china and Taiwan, we don't even know how to make high speed trains, and so but not investing in infrastructure smartly we are behind in global manufacturing and imaging that 50s era employment models are coming back... they are not any more than Boston, Camden or Brooklyn will be shipyards ever again... or large numbers of blacksmiths will make horse shoes or peope will make horse carriages etc, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The republicans have been professionally playing victim for years.

I agree though, we do need to reach out to southern and rust belt voters and say, yes, automation and globalization has left you behind and this is why the policy proposal of the Democratic Party will help you and your families.

But the other side of trump, the lies, the propoganda, the corruption and the attack on institutions needs to be pushed back against. 

And we cannot let those southern and rust belt Americans hold the rest of the country hostage. 

Coal is over. Manufacturing jobs are not going to employ or support the middle class. Even blue collar jobs will require increasingly complex math, reading comprehension and empirical thinking skills. Modern cars and machinery will be complex and digital. 

Our economy will need to adapt... it means protections for low wage workers, healthcare for people and an affordable cost, it means create ways for small and local businesses to survive and flourish, it means energy efficiency etc...

But that requires telling people the truth. That means restoring respect for science and expertise. So honestly, until those "hardened" blue collar white folks in these communites stop being special snowflakes and recognize that their industries are gone and they need to move on and vote for a party that actually cares about their lives and existence but less about their right to shoot things... well in the meanwhile we need to push back against trump. 

Attack his ego. Hold him accountable. Smother him with his own need for validation. Wreck his businesses through boycotts. Because trump does not care what the rust belt and southern folks think of him. He cares what the manhattan elite and the Hollywood stars and the tech czars think of him...  and they see him as dirt... an intellectual light weight, an uncultured con man, a C level celebrity and every day they let him know that will hoepfully push him to impeachable offense territory. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically, liver breaks down (metabolizes) alcohol, gets better at breaking it down with time by increasing the machinery available to process the alcohol. The problem is, this machinery can process more alcohol into toxic breakdown processes that can damage your liver. The metabolic process itself can also hurt the liver. 

 With time, your alcohol activates a certain pathway in your brain (GABA), with chronic heavy use your brain adjusts to decreasing your response to alcohol by making fewer receptors available. The problem is that for alcoholics who stop drinking abruptly, the system is clamped down, so without alcohol, it is under-activated. The problem is this system down-regulates brain activity,  so that is why in alcohol withdrawal you get quickened heart rate, high blood pressure, tremor, sweatiness, delusions, and seizures... until your brain adjusts or is weaned from the alcohol your brain is basically overexcited unless some agent is stimulating your gaba system... be it alcohol, benzos, barbs, or propofol... </TEXT>

The gist of his point carries across but the specifics of his point are unclear. Granted, it's only a piece of the sentence but I doubt the preceding part made the sentence work better. Grammar and sentence structure can be used for stylistic effect, but must work on some fundamental level to articulate a specific point. I think maybe the teacher could argue that the  student got the point across but a resounding "you can write, that much is clear" without marking up the last sentence either suggests very low standards, is fake, or the teacher does not care.

It cost our economy money by hurting trading partners, opened them up to Chinese invetment, created political instability, supported murder and torture, and created some of the instability that drives today's illegal immigration.

But, it's worse when they do it to your own opposition and journalist and citizens.  Or because Americans matter more but because it means the mechanisms to curtail these actions and drive change are lost. It's a sign of the compete loss of rule of law. Sure FBI had files on MLK and other civil rights and liberal acting activists. It was not good. But US residents or citizens were not jailed, murdered or tortured at home or abroad... yes obama drone striked that guy and his child and it created an uproar.

<TEXT> Idk, I don't think it was his choice of high road that did it, it was bungling his campaign often and early. 

First question he was asked to as about his brothers presidency.... not really unexpected and he totally bungled it. 

He never seemed to be really that into it, and that why trumps low energy moniker stuck. 

Trump is a professional school yard bully. Has been all his life. And he is really good and finding people's weakness, exposing it and making it stick... regardless of the substance and merit of that person. Low energy Jeb, crooked Hilary, it stuck because it played to what people were seeing. bush bumbling his campaign. 

Comie shitting on the hatch act and the near decade long republican hit job making Hilary look less than honest, as well as the Hilary campaigns way of handling of scandal did not help and the crooked moniker landed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long term toxicity is incredibly difficult to determine especially by the person exposed because the changes are subtle and progressive and can be chalked up to life changes and aging... it's really hard to know what someone might have been. Throw in a developing brain and that is even more complex. 

Small incremental change can add up over years of use and also because of social constructs impairment in late adolescence really stratified future opportunities, earning potential, and other socioeconomic factors. So even a minor temporary impairment can have life long effects (ironically for the same reason that criminalizes weed and charges against youth, particularly minority youth had lifelong impacts on outcomes).

Adding regular habitual use of psychoactive substances to the developing brain just seems like a bad idea. </TEXT>

It's also robust in that you still walk and talk and function but that does not mean that higher cognitive function, mood disorders, anxiety levels are not affected and in modern life where cognitive performance, delayed gratification, stress management are vital to financial security, career gratification, well being etc, etc, small subtle changes can have significant social and economic costs to the user... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your brain is still forming, you probably will have some acute effects but it's hard to know long term effects like anxiety, attention, subtle changes in cognitive function. Weed is probably less harmful than most drugs but it would not be a stretch to see it as more harmful in adolescents. 

Take lead for instance... lead poisoining in a child leads to life long cognitive deficit and impairment dose dependent. In adults there is acute toxicity, it's not good but much fewer long term neurological effects. 

Also chronic use of some drugs reprograms your brain. For instance long term use of heroin/opiates makes you hyper sensitized to pain, so people who use it for pain (physical and probably mental) chronically in addition to addiction and dependence also when off of it are less capable of dealing with their pain than before. 

Also, one might wonder if instead of developing healthy coping skills, exercise, mediation, mindfulness, adequate sleep, regular schedule, healthy relationships, work life balance, hobbies outside interests, etc... adolescents are substituting weed and therefore never form the coping skills and life skills needed to function well as an adult.

Also if you know it's bad but still do it you might see how you Le impulse control is in the rest of your life... if it's not good that's a problem. Training yourself for delayed gratification and impulse control and coping skills is the most valuable skill for thto rest of your life. Being informed won't fix that btw, it's about learning to deal with shit in a healthy way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He also planned to murder almost 90% of Slavs and eastern europeans from Poland to the urals... he felt more strongly about the Jews and disabled so much so he undertook the mass murder before and then even during the war despite needing the resources elsewhere. Hitler felt that the Jews were a threat to German security and society so bad to be exterminated immediately... the Slavs could wait until after the war. 

That is what people forget when comparing Hitler to Mao or Stalin. Sure both mao and stalin where murders on a large scale... Hitler aspired to murder on an unprecedented level. Mao and Stalin murdered for authoritarian and ideological reasons and Stalin was anti Semitic, but they did not murder people because they felt entire ethnicities should not exist. For Eastern Europeans, WWII was quite literally a life and death struggle.  </TEXT>

How are you going to tax people who do not have legal standing here? 

Or are you going to tax all wire transfers to Mexico? Not even sure that's legal but that would be hugely destabilizing and oddly punitive... many legal immigrants send money too. 

Why is it fair for legal immigrants and US citizens to be taxed for money they choose to send their family and friends in Mexico? 

How are you even going to identify remitiances specially? What is to stop someone from setting up a shell corporation in Mexico and then treat the remittances as payment for some nominal service? 

And what about other countries with illegals like china, or even migrants form Central American and South American countries?  </TEXT>

We know giving women control over reproduction is one of the most effective ways to reduce poverty, improve education and literacy, and helps the economy. And no birth control is prefect. Furthermore, everytime policy disregards that we are human and have human needs and desires it fails because people are evolved to need and want intimacy and sexual relations but likely with modern medicine we don't have 14 children per family as a result... </TEXT>

C) It's a long time until next election time... and I would not venture a guess as to the dynamics of that election... but since truth was not very important in this election and continues to be a weak spot with the trump administration, would not bank them having to do anything.

<TEXT> 1) good journalism, somehow we need to unite or penetrate across multiple tiers of the current fragmented media market.

2) get better at explaining complex platforms to voters and making them relevant to those voters.

3) voters need to start accepting the truth, any policy will have losers  and winners, you can't do everything for everyone. Truth and bad news have been absent from US politics. Coal is not coming back. Manufacturing jobs are going to get automated if they come back. Unskilled, entry level jobs are not going to command the salaries they did in the 50s. People will lose with globalization but we also can't stop it.

4) corollary to 3. With progress there are losers and winners. Unlike in the 90s and 00s where losers of globalization were overlooked, people who get marginalized need programs to help mitigate their suffering. Retraining, education opportunities, investment into those areas, increased minimum wage so if they do end up in entry level service work they can live with some dignity, healthcare etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I think it's complicated in that science and economics are tools... when it comes to policy, these are tools that can help achieve certain goals but are indifferent to the goals set. 

It is for as a society and political parties who are theoretically representative of society, to pick those goals, and then use science and economics to optimize the appropriate parameters... within the framework of government and law (in the US the framework of the constitution and according to principles of humanism and empiricism laid out in the Declaration of Independence and other works laid out by our founding fathers). 

 The problem and disconnect you see with parties is they say one thing and then cherry pick data to support that argument and then the results don't help those that they were supposed to help and hurt others while benefiting a third party...

The problem there is multi-factered but at the end of the day these parties, while ideological, are not stupid and simply tell the electorate one thing, manipulate science to support the proposal and claim, but in practice the policy was really never meant to help the electorate and is to the benefit of either a religious, ideological, corporate or socioeconomic segment of society. It's not necessarily that the policy isn't data driven or thought out, it's just sold as doing something else so it seems like it's logically and empirically unsound. 

The parties get away with it because the average voter is either not equipped or not willing to see through th BS and the media has failed to bridge said gap. </TEXT>

They won't see spencer as a loser anymore than 1930 Germans saw Hitler as a moody failed painter who wrote incoherent steam of consciousness tracts. 

Fascists want to be the victim and the aggressor and, just like in the 1930s they used anarchist and comunist movements in Europe as foils, culminating in burning (false flag?) attack on the Reichstag, Spencer will use this and similiar acts to rally people sympathetic to his cause.

For the fascists to admit spencer is a loser they have to admit they are losers or following him and it won't happen.

There needs to be a cold, dispassionate, colective rejection of the nascent fascist movement in America and this needs to come with programs that address wage stagnation, income inequality,  inadequate education, employment opportunities to strip the fascists of their recruiting base. </TEXT>

Can Russia/ China detect a 2 bomber flight? I mean it is not like the refueling tankers are stealthy....

Anyways, the B52 would have been cheaper, and also losing one to engine failure or mechanical problem is no so irreplaceable. Rather I was wondering why they did this from the concern that Libyan factions/ ISIS somehow has access to SAMs.

Every reason they gave for using the B2 applies to the B52 at likely a lower cost... except for stealth.

<TEXT> B52 is longer range, fewer refueling missions, net fuel might be less, especially depending where the refueling tankers are leaving from. Also b2 has a much higher hourly flight cost. So the total costs and even fuel cost of a b52 or 2 might be less when factoring net mission fuel consumption.  Although you correctly pointed out a pair of b52 would raise alarms from radar systems around the world. I am sure some calculus of available aircraft, threat assessments, training requirements and other considerations were weighted. I think though more went into this decision than simply bomb loads and even optics. China and Russia know we can do this as we did this in Iraq and Afghanistan and Bosnia... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk, democracy is fine depending on which element of the population you apply it to... the Scots want the EU and stayed because of the UK inclusion in the UK and access to the common market. The Scots feel they were betrayed in that they gave up their right to self-determination under false pretenses. It would be democratically sound for the scotish to revote on the referendum in light of this new reality and express their democratic principles and right to self-determination with the intention of joining the EU and being part of a broader European marketplace. 

Furthermore, the brexit vote happen under the aura of simply outright lies and misinformation by the brexit side. Democracy does not exist and a vacuum and is not always right, which is why most countries are republics or representative democracies. Putting such a vote as Brexit to a referendum was foolish and inappropriate... and back fired spectacularly. 

You could put to a referendum vote to make the queens corgi foreign minister, and it might pass, but it would not be sound democracy nor the right choice (although maybe better and less comical than Boris Johnson). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know, I agree, but it's more informal display and it is a recruitment tool, just like fly overs and games. Now is it some what problematic given how the military has been used recently and the pervasiveness and expanse of the military industrial complex? 

Yes, it's a problem,  but not the same level as a full on military parade through DC past the capitol building.

The former glorifies the military and use of force, and advertises the military industrial defense complex. Similiar to movies it misses the gravity of war and sells the flashiness of the hardware.

The latter is state sponsored intimidation and implies a military in service of the commander in chief, rather than country. It's soldiers being reviewed by their commander for their commander that's the problem... it's Hitler/Stalin/Gadaffi/pick a Kim/ Sadaam/Nasser etc. reviewing their armies, not answerable to their people, but to their leader.

The US military answers to the Comander and Chief but serves the constitution and the people and as such it is inappropriate for them to march in review for trump... far more so than doing a fly by at a playoff baseball game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your argument is odd, where is it written in the constitution that your should pay for roads or the military or healthcare for the old or children or public education or any of the the other myriad functions of government that are vital to the function of a modern society? You pay taxes and the government spends accordingly within the limits of the constitution. 

The same principles came be applied to things you use like roads and bank acounts (fdic insurance) or military protection or airports etc...

If the government only protected property rights modern society and economy would not function. Basic research would not happen, roads would be unbuilt, our military would not be able to defend our borders, gps would not exist, when you got old and say need dialysis you would just die if you did not have the money, streams would be polluted, air would be polluted, you would have no standard for food safety etc... 

  Now if your beef is with the mandate, we'll think of it as a tax, it's really functionally the same. And healthcare is such that as you get older you will need it, it's a question of how much. 

Your model only works if we are willing to let people suffer and die... if we can limit care to those that can afford it then people will sacrifice everything for insurance, but then people with chronic illness or diseases would be screwed , unable to work and this get health care and the what? Is it productive to have them suffer?

Your argument is spurious and totally ignores the functions of a modern advanced society and how that is funded and also suggests a complete navet as the actual costs of the services you rely on to live a modern life and the risks to your wealth and well being from potential health problems, natural disasters, etc. 

It's not difficult to see how sometimes helping others in a organized central government makes everyone's prosperity and quality of life go up.

Like for a life saving drug... the company could charge anything and you would have to pay... or die. It's not like you can shop around. You had a stroke, you need a clot buster, the company says give me $1 mill, and say your insurance say nope, no covering that, are you going to argue? It's not like you have time to shop around or go to another hospital... that's why regulation exists.

<TEXT> There are all sorts of things vital to women's health in the aca. Access to an gynecologist without a referral. Also without insurance oral contraceptives can be expensive, especially if for whatever reason women need a specific type. Furthermore, other contraceptive options are covered by the aca like mirena, depo, nexplanon. Repealing aca will decrease women's access to care and access to birth control. The situation is not free vs low cost, the situation is that with aca repeal for some women the costs will be prohibitive.

The same people who decry the aca, abortion and planned parenthood also lament freeloader welfare queens with many kids... you know women's control over reproduction is one of the few things consistently shown to improve poverty, well being of families and communities. Instead of worrying about whom might sleep with whom or who might get a free or unearned perk let's for once act on the societal interest.

Edit: women's health provisions aca

That's precisely why government exists because, among other things, we decided people should not suffer or die in the streets... so government exists to temper the excesses of free markets and to make sure important fundamental things vital to our society and economy are addressed.

This is not a corporate failure, it is a failure of politicians, regulation and government.  Corporate officers have one priority, their bottom line and that is their duty to shareholders to maximize said bottom line... any less is a breach of their responsibility.

Government then exists to make sure things like rights are respected, law is followed and the tings that allow the society to function are addressed... education, defense, infrastructure (roads, airports, trains), and health... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whole sale adopting European social democracy ala Bernie is also not something that will work in America. That was the problem with Bernie, no new ideas, just parroting the models of Northern European countries which have very different demographic, economic and geographical realities. Also European economies rely on the US economy and innovation to function...

The US needs a rehabilitation of her health care system, infastucture, safety net and schools but it's going to have be a clever and indigenous approach.

Yes, we need to cut military spending, increase spending on science, reform and centralize education (every kid in America should have access to a standardized modern curriculum that gives them a fighting chance in the knowledge economy), rebuild public transport, encourage sustainable city planning, make healthcare functional.

Increasing the minimum wage is a start, but stimulus bills need to be carefully thought out, education needs a clever revamp that goes around the voucher crazed evangelical right and the protect every teacher no standards,  no accountability left, etc. etc.

Bernie was an intellectual light weight, broken record, his repeating the same policy proposals for 60 years is only slightly less of a sign of being intellectually stunted than Paul Ryan worshiping an Rand...

Depo/implanon shots also beneficial because they are inconspicuous and no one knows you have them. Its about giving people options. Yes condoms are vital for std transmission prevention, but long acting birth control is a complete game changer for teen pregnancy.

If people have proper education and access to healthcare they can make informed choices about their reproductive health and navigate social stigma.

1) Russians: Germany murdered about 20 million in WWII, in Russia one of the great sources of national pride was contributing to stopping Hitler. Everyone had someone they lost, sometimes entire villages. Evoking German domination plays to that narrative (even though many Russian work in Germany, buy German cars and generally don't have a grudge towards individual Germans).

2)  Eastern European states Russia traditionally sees in her Spenser of influence. They too were subject to German atrocities in WW2, although some of the are wary of Russia too. This is to try to prevent them from looking economically and socially westward away from Russia.

3) European countries with national pride etc... Russia wants them to resent German economic power and leadership in the EU to help fracture the EU. Especially Southern European countries with imposed austerity already have issues with German treatment. Also immigration etc. are wedge issues. Putin is exploiting historical fault lines to weaken his economic and geopolitical adversary and neighbors.

He wants to do this to push his own Asia economic union which currently no one wants to be a part of. </TEXT>

Hilary can be accused of being closed off, not transparent, uncharasmatic etc... but she is not corrupt by any nations standard and her released emails and DNC emails show a dedicated public servant who care about her country...

<TEXT> IIRC progressives misjudged the situation and helped get a fascist elected... 

Hilary was boring, status quo, and establishment-backed, and Bernie got fucked by the DNC...

But there was a time to down the pitch forks and get people excited for Hilary, and not because Trump was a sexually assaulting (per his own description and victim accounts), peeping tom (walking through Teen USA pageant changing rooms per his own account), race baiting (Mexicans are rapist)... but because he posed a material threat to the democratic institutions and financial well-being of the country.  

The progressives misjudged the mood of the country, they thought their time was here and missed the part that we were in a life and death struggle for the future and well-being of our nation.

Clinton's home server, speaches to wall street, trumped up Ben ghazi hearings...
Vs Russian connections, speeches to wall street, shady business practices, opaque conflicts of interests, no release of tax returns, appointins bankers and military industrial compex and oil interests to the cabinet, etc... 

not to mention unhinged tweeting, clearly playing favorites with anyone who helped him get elected from trumpeting LL bean, to firing the long time inauguration announcer for someone who backed him, etc.

Nothing is too small or petty for him... he got rid of the guy who announces the innaguration http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charlie-brotman-inauguration-announcer-fired_us_58751638e4b099cdb0ffa92e for someone who backed him...

Demanding lists of people who worked on climate change and other causes, his advisor calling on CNN to clean hosue and fire unfriendly reporters...

Hilary sounds down right exciting at this point. </TEXT>

Pence is scary because the whole incredibly right wing, cut down the safety net, conversion therapy for gays, take America back to 1950 thing...

Pick your poison? I think the thing we can hope for is Trump campaign did actually collude with Russia and Pence and Trump both knew about it... so both get impeached... 

...but then we get pseudo-wonk and ayn rand aficianado (a common sign of stilted intellectual development past high school) Paul Ryan who wants to cut medicare to  a fixed grant system and privtize it along with social security....

So in the end, I don't know where things land will be better? Except maybe if Trump goes it will spare us the globally destabilizing tweets?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk, I think the interchangeability of swear words like crud, crap, shit is relatively new,  and our generation is definitely less sensitive to it as a whole. But I think the loss of delineation of severity does strip nuance from the language and limits expression. It's nice having grades of bull shit. 

It's nice to be able to say you did a crap job or that's crap to someone who is doing a mediocre job or is producing a mediocre falsehood and but then have the lexicon to tell someone they did a shit job or their claim is shit if they are really underperforming or deliver a real whopper...

<TEXT> Um, this was not a classic military ship, it was a spy ship made to look like a freighter, they on purpose were meant to look like diminutive in inconspicuous vessels. This is not a destroyer brimming with guns and missles.  

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/USS_Liberty_%28AGTR-5%29.jpg/450px-USS_Liberty_%28AGTR-5%29.jpg

From the cockpit of a mirage jet or a fast attack boat it is hard to tell whose ship it is. The Egyptian navy at the time while not a blue water navy had destroyer and missile boats and was not some run down endeavor. Moreover, the Israeli navy at the time was reall y primitive and in its infancy, attention was on the airforce and ground forces.

To suggest it was an act of intentional aggression against US naval forces is not borne out by investigations or make sense for Israeli national interest. 

edit:
this is what israel thought it was attacking, single funnel, single mast destroyer of the egyptian navy:

Not hard to see why they messed up. It is not like they had sophisticated radar or communication gear. They had no real anti capital ship capability... clearly poorly thought and not premediated, just trying to pre-empt further attacks on Israeli positions.

Honestly, people don't get how much their healthcare costs. Medicare recipients who argued they paid into the system so they deserve care mostly paid only 1/3 of the actual cost of their care. 

We need to stop seeing healthcare as a business or something earned. It's a way of helping people lead productive lives. It means helping elders be healthier and more independent, people with mental illness to cope and function, people with chronic diseases to cope and function, average Americans to be healthier and more productive... etc.

It's like roads, transport, etc... it's a part of the framework that allows a modern society and economy function. We are the only western advanced democracy that approaches health care as a private not public good. </TEXT>

Resisted calls to investigate concerns Russia hacked the dnc to selectively leak information to affect the election. Refuses to release his tax returns... lots of smoke... reasonable cause for further investigation.

You compared that to pizza gate.. where podesta discusses pizza in an email and then anon misconstrued some completely innocent pictures into a child trafficking conspiracy that was just a rehashed updated version of 90s spirit cooking allegations...

Do you not get false equivalency? I don't care what your political affiliation, it more suggests hyperbole at best, deflection at worst or an inability to compare and evaluate the authenticity and evidence behind allegations...

Skepticism is good...   blindly lumping everything as false crock or shit is not helpful. We need to trust some information to inform our decisions, otherwise it's a fact free world. Might as well flip a quarter for every decision.

<TEXT> The dossier is likely false, the CNN article, judging by his teams strategy to deflect is likely true, and it would be interesting to see how they believe they might have tried to compromise him. But more importantly, without his tax filing we have not way to know Russia's and other foreign powers fiscal ties with the Trumps organization... really that is what is needed and likely why he won't release his tax filings like every other modern president. 

To suggest that this is comparable to some random anon members generating a conspiracy because podesta once ordered some cheese pizza and claiming his order pizza meant he was running a child trafficking ring scandal... well that is disingenuous false equivalency not far removed from the performance from Kelly Anne that the OP posted above.

This attack on truth and investigation is part of the problem. Information comes in grades of legitimacy, pizza gate is at the bottom, buzz feed dossier just above that, and some ways up above that, actually quite a ways up, is the CNN report... 

And no one is accusing trump of specific transgressions, there are calls for further investigation of foreign attempts to influence the election... not exactly comparable to pizza gate.

<TEXT> Trump's administration goes after the press, calling for culls of reporters, demanding fluff pieces, demanding impossible journalistic standards, lying and decrying use of anonymous sources...

Basically, she is calling for a dismantling of the 4th estate and any opposition press. 

That is chilling. With Trump's Twitter and YouTube channels his administration has direct, uncontested, daily, and instant access to the public. With a chief advisor who is the former editor of breitbart they have a friendly news organization that has an ~~alt righ~~ fascist agenda... This all adds up to an attack on the foundation of democracy by eroding any levers or accountability. 

At at time when Trump's party has control of both the executive and the legislative branches, the need for an independent and robust media is vital, especially as the judiciary is at risk in the common years as well... otherwise who is left to hold Trump and company to account? And so these attacks on the media are particularly distressing. 

By their standards deep throat could not have happened, the pentagon papers shouldn't have been published, none of the wiki leaks stuff they so heavily used in their campaign should admissible, etc... they want total control...

Furthermore, they seem to have no problems with lying themselves, conflating the truth and doing all the things they falsely accuse the press of... they are now the elected government... it's far worse when they do than some blog news site.

All of Trump's demonstrably wrong tweets... are those lies or mistakes? Why don't they fire him? They are straight up gas lighting us right now. The ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda is being birthed in front us on TV.

If people though Cheney and then build up got the Iraq war, the silencing of ambassador Wilson and outing Plame, etc was peak disingenuousness for the Bush administration... Trumps administration, I think, is going to make that look like child's play. </TEXT>

Hypocrisy implies CNN is actually lying... which they are not. Trumps team is just flat out gaslighting us.

The fucking ministry of public enlightenment and propoganda is being birthed in front us on TV. 

If people though Cheney and then build up got the Iraq war, the silencing of ambassador Wilson and outing Plame, etc was peak disingenuousness for the Bush administration... trumps administration I think is going to make that look like child's play. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump's administration goes after the press, calling for culls of reporters, demanding fluff pieces, demanding impossible journalistic standards, lying and decrying use of anonymous sources... 

Basically she is calling for a dismantling of the 4th estate and any opposition press. That is chilling.


With trump's Twitter and YouTube channels and direct access to the public, and assault on the press, a chief advisor who is the former editor of breitbart and hence basically a friendly news organization... it's an attack on the foundation of democracy.

By their standards deep throat could not have happened, the pentagon papers shouldn't have been published, none of the wiki leaks stuff they so heavily used in their campaign should admissible, etc... they want total control... </TEXT>

2) Anderson might have been mistaken, and he denounced linking to the busted article if it did happen.

3) Kellyanne would not specify what part of the CNN report is false, is spinning a false anti CNN narrative, suggests that CNN and other news organizations clean house of reporters to improve relations with the White House, suggest news should no publish reports that might lead to other people publishing reports, and wants to have reporters held to a standard of 100% right or fired (not even peer reviewed science articles meet that standard, there are anomalies in data) rather than print retractions...

She also attacks press popoularity ratings, conflates reports, refuses to address specifics, and just goes after any opposition press. It's terrifying.

She complained that when obama was elected the press focused on superficial things like the noble prize... trump didn't win a noble prize and obama was not appointing people with Russia ties to the cabinet at a time of concern when Russia was trying to influence US elections. 

It's like they don't understand that the press' job is to report events... not to to ensure the president has a good image? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is hurtful and it sucks... it feels wrong and distasteful. But the problem is public opinion goes and cycles and after agressive progress on many issues like gay marriage rural voters are feeling like their needs aren't a focus. And regardless of the merit to their feelings, when Trump promises them the world, dems need need to counter that. 

The aggressive roll back of healthcare and govenment programs that is going to happen is going to far more harmful to vulnerable marginalised minorities than many other groups. 

Furthermore, if minorities and young people want a say things, they need to more aggressively turn out to the polls. 

So it sucks, it feels wrong, but if income inequality and social safety nets are not improved then margenalized minorities are going to be the canaries in the coal mine for all working and middle class workers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The free market is only concerned with balancing supply and demand today. That is the input and output. It does not care if the company is there 1 year later, 10 years later etc. 

Its why it can't factor in global warming, the cost of global warming is not reflected in the cost of fossil fuels because the price is paid in the future collectively. 

Economists agree on this. Growth has happened because free markets efficiently allocate resources, the population grows, we consume more, creates long term growth... but its does not have to, it just has so far. Companies following free market principles look to short term growth and earnings reports.

Its why westen companies build factories in China knowing their IP will be stolen and chinese will build knock offs because in the next 5 years they will turn a profit. 

It is why government builds roads, funds  basic science, funds the military, etc... the highway system generated the opportunity for auto markets, for goods transport, etc. Government airports allow for air travel. Free markets don't care if everyone has access to roads, or to education or healthcare. 

A free market solution to healthcare would be to let poor people die. A free market solution to roads would be if you cannot afford to pay for road use you would be unable to get around. A free market solution to education would be people would only get what their parents could afford. A free market approach to the environment would be people could pollute where ever as long as the goods they produced were purchased.

<TEXT> I do not get how markets apply to a public good. A school produces two products, education and educated students. The customers are the students themselves and society. Free markets break down when the consumer-producer relationship is indirect. Furthermore, for poor students, its not like they have the resources or options to shop around anymore than you have time shop prices for hospitals when you having a heart attack or price out local fire departments when your house is burning. 

Furthermore, society benefits if everyone gets a good education, and the students cannot pay, so if their parents are poor, they currently get a terrible education. This further worsens income inequality and costly cycles of crime and poverty. Private schools already do this, they focus on good students, cut struggling or problem ones, help the wealthier students with educated parents, not deal with the rest. 

Except the problem students are the ones that are going to be very costly to society if not educated to some basic level of auntonomy. And we can blame parents, but when they break into your house, well no one is putting their parents in jail. 

The proposal would be to have publicly funded schools, with competitive teaching salaries, which would also reflect the demand on that skill set... stem, programming etc would get paid better because other sectors want those workers than music or art. 

But giving over education to companies does not work because their incentives are to cut costs and short-run profits, not long-term student quality, equal edcuation, or helping struggling stidents. 

In any case, performance-based pay, incentives to work in shitier schools disticts, professional acountability will create competition for those jobs, creating a competive labor market. 

We see this in places with good education systems like in Finland or South Korea. Well paid, highly professional teachers, with competitive salaries and benefits. 

Free markets are a tool. In the short run they help balance resources and assign costs. They are less good for situatiuons were long term value is needed and were there are negative externalities where cost is not factored into the pricing. 

So cutting education costs can save money now, but later the work force will suffer for lack of candidates and crime will go up etc... but the market does not factor in that later cost. 

The internet, btw, is not fully privatized, its run on a government backbone and is still goverened by the US rules (net neutrality). Fully removed of controls you would get throttling of specific domains based on the relationship of you ISP and the content provider. Furthermore, the internet is not a fundamental public good, like healthcare or education.

<TEXT> Well, the problem is that at the wage that they are paid, and the shit they have to deal with, it does not attract top talent... which is a problem.

Education is complex because teachers were historically paid less in America because it was traditionally a woman's job. This tradition was left over from the one room school houses of the American fronteir. Because it was one of the few avenues for women to work it meant that they got very qualified and talented candidates at a low cost.

Since women entered the rest of the labor market they now compete with private sector salaries and the salaries teachers are paid do not attract top talent. 

So they system is screwed from 2 sides. 

* Dem supported teachers unions using tenure to protect shitty teachers, make it hard for talented new teachers, and prevent accountability. 
* Republicans pushing to cut salaries, defund the system, and sell the system out to private corportations from running the school to making the testing.

Also 3 additional issues:

* Constant anti-intellectual movements to cut science from schools and push religous/ political agendas (banning evoloution, texas getting rid of jefferson from their textbooks because he was to liberal etc.)
* Overemphasis on sports and sports teams, huge funding for highschool football, cutlure of worshiping the sports teams, anti-intellectual spirit
* Toxic, material driven, environment of public schools, made even more toxic by social media. Literally its seems like everything other than education is of import in the schools.

What needs to happen is teachers need to be paid more, receive performance pay, increased bonuses for working in shittier areas, but also increased acountabiltiy, training, accreditation just like other professionals.

We need to commit to as a country guranteeing as solid education to all of our citizens. A undertrained illetrate popoulation will struggle competing in a global marketplace, is a risk to our national security (worse candidates for the military), and makes for uniformed voters.

As to privatizing public goods? when has that gone well? becauase health insurance compaines, for profit health care, for profit prisons, or mercenaries have worked out so well? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That the point isn't it? What separates us from him is rule of law and due process. Due process is about assessing if someone committed an act and the proportional punishment. 

So even if it is clear that he had committed the crime, it has to be shown he had the capacity to understand that he was committing a crime and then to ascertain the appropriate punishment. 

Without that process it is just murder or violation of someone rights and freedoms... furthermore, having the accused stand trial is a way to hold someone responsible for their action and assigning responsibility. 

It is as much for society, the victims and their families as it is for the punishment and sentencing. 

It is a way of establishing that what he did was wrong and will not be tolerated in a systematic way... makes it harder to then later spin and craft narratives.

Take Nuremburg post WWII, it is helpful because it held what was left of the Nazi leadership accountable for their role. It is instructive because they did not deny their actions, just minimized their collective roles or stated they were following orders. 

But the trial documented the evidence against, the charges, the witness testimony and their defense so posterity can have this as a record of their crimes and guilt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the dems failed to make a case to the bulk of american voters why trump and the republicans are a threat to their well-being. 

But if your father and grandmother voted dem except for trump, then that is irrational because he stands against most democratic issues and with a republican congress will have the chance to implement those polices. 

I think you need to do some soul searching why they voted against hilary... either they bought into the crooked hilary message, didnt care for a woman in office, or just did not like her. But voting Trump and then dem down ballot seems not well thought out.

If they care about medicare, social security, income inequality, minimum wage, and other stalwart dem platforms, then I don't understand where trump fit that narrative. 

People can be wrong, and your father and grandmother and another slightly less than 50 million voters were largely wrong. It is hard to see the merit in the argument of side that argues against scientific consensus or economic theory and dismisses educated opinion as liberal propaganda. One side tries an evidence based approach, Trump just shoots his mouth off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, foreign aid, modernish medicine, decreased mortality rate... particularly child mortality. If fertility stays the same population grows rapidly... problem is even in more successful African states like nigeria large families are a religious and cultural thing so there is no drop off in fertility like happened is the West, Asia, and even catholic Latin America. Also, income inequality and subjugation of women doesn't help. Nigeria is projected to be 400 million by 2050 and 800 by 2100. 

But what you point out will happen, and the problem is when the continent collapses into starvation, war etc. (more than now), and the 1 billion refugees flee north to Europe... what will happen? 

So to avoid that, Europe needs to invest a bit more in African family planning, income inequality, and women empowerment programs... or start building the wall's and coast guard navies/ steal themselves to watching a 100s of millions starve.

<TEXT> I don't disagree that we are not at end times, and rejected that rhetoric during the came, but Trumps cabinet and policy proposals pose a real threat to the well-being of many American citizens. 

The other issue is that American has repeatedly failed to make the substantial and meaningful structural changes to its economy necessary to address long term major challenges like climate change, income inequality, health care costs and health care disparities. 

These will catch up with us, and while Hilary likely offered treading water, Trump carries the risk of sinking the ship. The trillions lost on Iraq and to Bush tax cuts continue to haunt our fiscal policy and foreign policy to this day. It is naive to believe that Trump, with republicans in control of the executive, the legislative and soon judicial branches will be unable to do irrevocable harm to the nation.

Furthermore, there is concern regarding trumps fitness to be president. He is unprecedented on many levels and this creates uncertainty that is worrying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is not about Hilary vs Trump, the election is over. It is about Trump going back on his promises before he even takes office.

 His cabinet is full of the very special interests he decried and promised to tackle. And it is only the beginning. Winning the election does not make Trump's positions or governance good for the country. It means he won the election. 

And while I do wish that things work out, early signs suggest that he has not clue what he is doing and his cabinet is staffed with conspiracy theorists, bankers, generals, special interests, and billionaires. The swamp is represented amply; from oil interests, to the military industrial complex, to bankers etc. 

With discussion of obama care repeal, privatizing the VA and medicare, privatizing social security a lot of people are going to get hurt. 

There is already concern of compromising net neutrality. There is concern about a new patriot act. A cabinet of generals, trumps propensity for bombastic twitter foreign policy, plan to increase our navy size, means conflict is more, not less likely. 

Ultimately, I think many trump supporters are going to be hurt by their vote. And when that happens they are going to double down behind him... because people do not like to be wrong. Maybe I am wrong, and I hope I am... time will tell. </TEXT>

You can fight for social issues and other liberal platforms, just focus on the economic messaging at a time when people are worried about their economic well being.

The Republicans do this all the time. Focus on popular things like cutting taxes, occasionally trot out a wedge issue or two to attack the dems. They hide their big bussiness lobbyist platform and othe rless savory platforms.  </TEXT>

Check out the resale value on a diamond, it's terrible. Investment grade stones are 100s of 1000s because they are unique.

Gold, as in pure gold ingots is more complicated,  risk of theft, potentially volatile, no t liquid or easily convertable to goods... not particularly safe either. 

Anytime people invoke the real goods argument it's ridiculous, everything has a nominal price and is dependent on social constructs to command that price. Real estate might be real but your claim to it or it's value is a socioeconomic construct. Same with a dollar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because people forgot about Western European exploits in the Congo or in other colonial undertakings. Agreed that one of the particularly terrifying aspects of the holocaust is a relatively modern western nation industrially murdered people their own citizens (and later neighbors) for being different... but when you realize that nazis did not see Jews or Slavic peoples as people, you start to see how it happened...

It's a reminder why current conspiracy theories and alt right pushes for racial segregation are so dangerous, they sow the seeds for potentially horrible outcomes. We need to be vigilant because once such ideas hit critical mass they can be hard to roll back. Civilization and modern society are but very fragile and thin veneer s that need constant buffing and care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Germans who ran the camps provided many of the estimates. 

Eastern Europe was dotted with abandoned villages and towns where the people simply vanished. Jews stopped being part of the German popoulace. French and west European Jews also never returned. 

There is documentation and German testimony of their methods and the pace of the murder. This was a huge operation, many German soldiers were involved. 

Nazi leaders defense was also almost never that it didn't happen. Their defense was that they either just followed orders or did not know the extent. They didn't deny the evidence or the murders themselves. One Nazi division of soldiers who followed Nazi troops in the invasion of the USSR documented the murder of 1 million Jews even before transport to concentration camps.

And then after the war there was video evidence and documentation of the camps. Polish resistance had snuck into the camps and documented the slaughter. Allied over flights showed the set up of the camps and the gas chambers in operation.

But the part that I do not get is the part where people pretend they are surprised... the Germans were doing what they said they would do... 

You can disagree with Israels situation and actions but to suggest the holocaust is a Zionist fabrication simply ignores the numbers... Europe lost 67% of the Jews in occupied German territory and these people vanished. Their bones and fragments sometimes still found littering mass graves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Um, ok, are you one of the "no jews died" crowd, the "some jews died" crowd, or the "nit picking with the 6 million number" crowd.

Because for the "no jews died" crowd we have video footage of dead jewish bodies in concentration camps.

For "some jews died" crowd, well we have the 1930s germany went from having 240,000 jews to almost none, and then the fact that entire jewish neighborhoods and villages in eastern europe stopped existing. Based on the people who ran aushwitz and other concerntation camps they admit to murdering millions. If its 5 something, or its 7 something million we will never know, but in the balls park of 6 million jews and 5 million additional others were murdered in the camps. 

For the "nit picking with the 6 million number" crowd see above. 

Otherwise, ask yourself why it so hard for you to accept the fact 2/3 of european jews were murdered in the 30s and 40s.

For people like you allies video tapede the camps, made german and local civllians tour the camps in germany and recorded witness testimony and presevered germanies own meticulous records.

But moreover, why is it a surprise, the nazis did what they said they were going to do, they jsut didnt have the chance to finish murdering all the jews and were jsut getting started on the slavs. Afterall, nazis did not see jews or slavs as human, so why is it a surprise that they went about murdering them?

Why is there such a movement for holcoaust denial... while pan acceptance of much less well document genocides like armenia.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't get denial, Hitler and the Nazis are almost comically and 2 dimensionally evil in a way that almost never happens in history. 

Of course the leadership never denied the holocaust... Massive genoicde was the reason why the  Nazis fought the war. Some like goering tried to distance themselves a bit from it and core Nazi ideology, or pretend not to be aware of the extent, but no one tried the it did not happen defense. 

Hitler laid out the idea of Lebensraum, or living space in his prewar speeches and writings. The plan was to murder everyone in eastern europe and colonize it with germans.

They started with the jews as they were deemed subhuman/ inferior and hitler saw them as a threat that weakened germany. They were the priority and even as the war was turning he still poured resources into slaughtering them.

But, it was just the warm up act, they planned to murder millions more slavs and others too. The holocaust was not an event that happened as a part of the world war II, it was why the Nazis went to war. It even guided strategic planning and was at the core of hitlers refusal to authorize retreats on the eastern front. 

It was almost like for the nazis, winning the war and not committing genocide was not victory at all... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Entire villages... gone. 6 million never to be seen againn (+ the 5-6 million additional non jews, gays/roma/etc). The scary part is that it was the warm up act. 

They planned to kill the jews, that was priority #1, such that even as the soviets were advancing and the allies were opening new fronts, germany still devoted logistics and man power to killing jews.

The there was phase 2 where hitler planned to murder and enslave all the slavs in eastern russia/ukraine/poland and colonize the areas with germans. 

He was so set on this that he refused to authorise retreats on the eastern front any any cost, even if it meant over stretched supply lines and spread out defensive positions because it would mean loss of territory where he could muder everyone and colonize with slavs.

That is the scary part... the 6 million was practice for the full plan and for Hitler the entire point of the military plan was to carry out it out, all or nothing.

When people search for the holocaust they are looking for scholarly vetted and accepted work, just like they might if they searched for the American revolution etc. Because of how vocal deniers are it can skew results and game the system so people might get those results first. It makes the internet unusable because now you can't find properly sourced relevant info. 

Google makes the whole internet usable. People have forgotten how far search engines have come and how hard it was to find things in the 90s and early 00s.

So when things got bad people turned to fundamentalist/sectarian movements because at least unlike the nationalist movement they were a bit less corrupt. 

So western/Russian (now Chinese) middle eastern meddling is a problem but Iranian vs gulf, Sunni vs Shiite, anti Israel fixation, tribalism (some places) etc... has resulted in regression in social norms, increase violence and radicalization, economic stagnation... etc.

Middle eastern populations need to stop hating each other based on religion, Sunni vs Shiite, ethnicity and move on to revuild the region. Stop the fixation with Israel. Stop tolerating Saudi and Quatari money funding instability etc. Time to join the 21st century... </TEXT>

If Trump had Alzheimers his tweets would reference past events or circumstances. He would have difficulty staying on message rally to rally etc. 

His denial of past tweets is perplexing but I think it is more likely that he lives in his own reality and as most con men, is used to bluffing and denying his way through obstacles. 

His media approach this entire campaign is deny, redirect, attack. I think the bigger concern is Trump's willingness to lie, bypass the media, and constantly attack the press, degrading any challenge to his own propaganda and claims.  </TEXT>

And this trump voter is not going be swayed by trump shooting his mouth off on twitter, or trumps lack of character, or his hurting the rights of lgbt/ minority communites. 

These voters just shot themselves in the foot out of fear, insecurity and anger. We need to show them how these program help them and allay those fears, otherwise we are collectively doomed.

It hurts, but we have to collectively swallow our distrust and sense of hurt and be the adults in the room, because the country is in the hands of a petulant spoiled 70 year old child, and the adults need to what is needed not what feels good... </TEXT>

The problem is you might have no sympathy but due to the nature of sharing a country and government massive changes to social and economic policy will hurt all of us together.

So the sooner we move past wtf were they thinking voting in Trump and his merry band of republican congressman... 

and on to how do we make the platform of healthcare, retirement, social services relevant to the red state voter that just shot him/herself in the foot to spite the snooty liberals, the better.

It might be hurtful to have to work and reach out to the people who  denigrate the issues and platforms dear to many of us, but we need them in 2 years to at least get one chamber of congress to put a break on trump, his cabinet, the house... and maybe moderate his legacy of supreme court nominations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hitler by accounts had an incredibly detailed memory. Also he was, it seems,  a charismatic both as a public speaker and in private. His downfall was in that he assumed he knew everything. 

In practice his military training was minimal, he was a pretty low level officer in WWI. Early successes in WWII some because of changes at his behest made him buy into his tactical genius. As the war went on and things got worse, he became paranoid and distrustful and took more and more control resulting in more and more mistakes.

Furthermore, his dogma of murdering all the Jews/Slavs/etc and gaining "living space" for Germany meant he refused to authorize any retreats on the eastern front meaning units were isolate and destroyed with over stretched supply lines and were destroyed. He also continued to devote massive ressources to his genocidal undertakings even as everything else was falling apart.

At the end of the day, intelligence is but one part of success. Hitler probably was relatively intelligent in some ways, if not in well rounded ways. In Hitler's case, ideology, hubris and paranoia were his undoing. Also, the meth and opiates didn't help. Probably based on his odd personal behaior has underlying personality disorder or mental illness too.

Furthermore, Trump is engaged in unprecedented shady shit:

Trump is:

* 1) Running his own security force focused on protestor control
* 2) Engaged in murky business practices that probably have conflicts of interest with US interests.
* 3) Naming a cohort of billionaires, generals, and wall street to his cabinet.
* 4) Refusing to do press conferences, holding rallies and disseminating media directly through you tube. 
* 5) Hired an alt-right media leader as his chief strategist. 
* 6) Refuses to investigate widespread allegations a foreign power has engaged in disruptive propaganda and cyber warfare in America while his staff stripped any sanction of said government from the republican platform and appointed pro-Russia nominees to his cabinet. 
* 7) Puts his children who are going to run his businesses on calls dealing with state matters.
* 8) Constantly attacks any dissenting press reports or any press reports that do not support his narcissistic narrative...

This list goes on.  </TEXT>

Islamic terroriziam has reached the state its at now because of continued conditions and instability of Islamic regions and continued support from Saudi and whabist sources. Furthermore, the internet has expanded their reach and communication in a unprecedented way.

Furthermore, to your conjecture regarding the welfare of these countries under colonial rule, it was the excesses of colonial rule and the lack of real organic institutions that resulted in popoular uprisings and then the collapse of any real democratic or modern institutions... often fueled by competing geopolitical agendas and resource needs of western powers as well as sectarian divisions previously exploited by western powers.

<TEXT> I do not believe that the Koran and Muslim teachings are somehow uniquely destabilizing and corrupting. People make decisions based on how they are incentivized and sometimes when their is instability it makes people respond on maladaptive ways. Combatting extremism means getting at why here is instability and give people alternative ways to address their anger or frustration or fear. 

Fundamentalism and fanaticism in any for is bad and saying let's stop admitting muslims, let's kick out the one that are here and let's single out this religion for further scrutiny is a bad precedent and ultimately will be more corissive to Europe than beneficial. 

Socioeconomic engagement and helping restore middle eastern stability will help stem the flow of migrants and reduce radicalization. Dwelling on Islam using 19the century Churchill quotes is not helpful and ironic because as an agent of British empire he helped set up the conditions of today's instability.

<TEXT> That is a fine quote but it happens that islam is the religion of these dysfunctional countries. In other places other forces wrought havoc. From pol pot onward. Moreover, the british exploited sectarian and religous differences to control and subjugate large tracts or asia and the middle east. 1890s anthopological and econiomic observation needs to be viewed from the colonial circumstances of the time and observer.

I think the answer is more complex than something about islamic teaching or culture is some potent mechanism to breed terrorism.Rather, the issue is lack of civic institutions in many of these countries, lack of access to accurate and free press, corruption, poverty and high birth rates. Furthermore, the middle east has been particularly destabilised by a mixture of dutch disease, foreign geopolitical jostling, and corrupt strongmen.

This is important because its clues us into what needs to be done and it is a warning to Western democracies about the risks of what can happen in their own countries. 

Ultimately, the Syrian situation needs to be addressed and the instability there stemmed so that the flow or refugees stops. Otherwise, how are you going to stop millions of desperate people flowing over borders without spending huge resources on militarizing the border. Also, middle eastern instability creates the space for isis and other radicalization.

Western Europeans needs to stop fixating on Israel and address the middle eastern nation's disfunction... which will be hard, but its the only way. Just like in America no wall will stop desperate hondurans who face death at home... same with Syrians and other middle eastern refugees.

<TEXT> Well, why are there no Greek conspiracy theories? There are plenty of Greek tycoons and Greeks in America are also very successful. It's because while Jews historically were a part of insular communities, on the other side of the equation, governmental and religious institutions around the world have for centuries created a cannon of antisemtic conspiracy theories for various self serving reasons over the ages. You had the czars and elders of Zion, Hitler and his claim the Jews were weakening the aryans, Jews drinking christians blood (inquisition, I think)... etc. 

This tradition continued in Arab dictatorships to drive their own nationalist agendas and now has moved into the lexicon of Arab theocratic governments and organizations.

For someone bored, or dissatisfied looking to find someone to point a finger against Jews are an easy target because they don't even have to make  up their own conspiracy theories. There is an existing library of 100s of years of state sponsored propaganda and conspiracy theories about Jews. </TEXT>

<TEXT> what? Hitler constantly fired generals for retreating or suggesting retreats. Personally ordered army groups around, and disregarded advice from any general he disliked. His greatest disasters (and some successes) came as the result of disregarding military advice. He held absolute power. People were relieved of army groups for suggesting tactical retreat.

Hitler was, first and foremost, determined to command personally. According to his so-called Leader Principle (Fhrerprinzip), ultimate authority rested with him and extended downward. At each level, the superior was to give the orders, the subordinates to follow them to the letter. In practice the command relationships were more subtle and complex, especially at the lower levels, but Hitler did have the final say on any subject in which he took a direct interest, including the details of military operations, that is, the actual direction of armies in the field.

Moreover, as time went on he took over positions that gave him ever more direct control. From leader (Fhrer) of the German state in 1934, he went on to become commander-in-chief of the armed forces in 1938, then commander-in-chief of the army in 1941. Hitler wanted to be the Feldherr, the generalissimo, exercising direct control of the armies himself, in much the same sense that Wellington commanded at Waterloo, albeit at a distance. http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/hitler_commander_01.shtml

Romney and many modern day republicans in an obsession with supply-side economics, free markets, unrestrained capitalism did not seem to get that this wasn't the goal itself. Market efficiency is irrelevant if that means a couple of guys own the country and the rest are little better than slaves. It was not clear the Romney saw the human side of the job.

<TEXT> Have you read accounts? Stalingrad was bypassed, the German troops were freezing, starving, out of food, and ammunition. There was no armor left. The airlift was a failure and by then the Germans had not the planes or airfields or fuel to continue... and by then they had lost all airfields in Stalingrad. The northern pocket held out a bit longer but surrendered when the Soviets just pointed artillery and tanks point blank at building by building.

Paulus was likely not even the one who initiated the negotiations. Hitler in his inability to fathom tactical retreats doomed Germans soldiers all over the eastern front and ultimately hastened the end of the war...  100k starving, frostbitten, unarmed, immobile troops are not going to carry on any measurable fight. It's ironic because the encircle, bypass, mop up pattern was learned by the soviets from the Germans in their early reversals in the war.

Ultimately, hitlers incompetence was a good thing for everyone but the nazis so no complaints... Auchwitz was liberated that much earlier, it meant the allies could open new fronts, Hitler lost his window for Moscow or southern Russian oil... Stalingrad was a failure, the most visible and costly example of Hitler's own blind spots and weaknesses.

edit: Also there was no honor in fighting for Germany and there was no integrity in that nation...

it was run by a pack of murderous ideologues on pharmaceutical grade meth and synthetic opiates who wanted to hold as much territory so they could murder more Jews and Slaves and loot more material and treasure.

And China can weather a trade war better than we can owing to smaller deficits and large cash reserves, while blaming hardship on US belligerence.

<TEXT> Paulus surrendered at Stalingrad because the Russians were about to outright annilihate them. 

Stalingrad should have been bypassed to begin with and then evacuated or broken out of when things got bad. It was held because it was named after Stalin and Hitler could not cope with losing any territorial gains even transiently. 

So yes, Paulus saved his own skin but his command staff facilitated the surrender and whether they fought and died made no difference by the time they surrendered.

Thankfully for the allies and humanity, aside from some luck earlier in the war, Hitler's mistrust of others and arrogance coupled his being a rather amateur tacticition and strategist meant he ultimately handicapped the German efforts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe, just maybe McCain swallowed those insults to get re-elected so that he can stick it to Donald... 

Romney cowed and kneeled for the Don, maybe McCain has a spine and some principles left after all these years and will fight. Him and Lindsey Graham can be the buklwark, the check of trump, the mavericks... Rand Paul can fight for civil liberties and join them as needed.

Maybe amidst the bleak landscape there is hope. Give us hope McCain and Lindsey Graham, continue the fight Rand Paul.

<TEXT>  Green house gasses do not fundamentally alter the physics governing earths weather. The equator remains hot because of its position relative to the sun, seasons still happen because of the earth's tilt.

Green house gasses do trap heat, and this has disperate effects. Now some of these effects because of long term shifts in weather and global temperatures, but the rate is much faster than anything we have seen before and seems to correlate with man made changes to the amount of green house gas in the environment.

As things heat up the equatorial regions dry out, wetter regions get wetter until global warming disrupts things like the Gulf Stream and then places in Europe will get colder and drier... other currents and weather patterns might mean similiar disruptions and then you might have some places change their character from wet to dry or cold to warm or the reverse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When the titanic sank the only solace for the wealthy was their wives and kids had a better chance of getting a life boat and the band played nearly to the end. 

The orange el duce has been handed the tiller just as the wireless ticks off "...saw much heavy pack ice and great number large icebergs also field ice." 

But el duce has no time for briefings or advice. 

"Full steam ahead," he roars prudence and reason be damned! I have deals to make."

Unfortunately, for our orange friend, and the souls aboard his ship, the rules of physics and nature do not negotiate nor do they care about his deals...

The ballroom glitters, the wealthy dance, the music plays. Below in steerage, the poor huddle together amid a blanket of hope, new opportunities and futures await. Their captain won't steer them wrong, they will get to the promised land. 

The ship hurtles on into the enveloping night.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think the problem is Hitler is a loaded topic, I think if you substitute someone like Mussolini it is an easier discussion to evaluate the perils of trum leadership. 

Furthermore, there is Hitler in the 1920s (building power base), the 1930s(consolidating power) and 1940s (WWII and fall). Comparisons fail because people see WWII Hitler not beer hall putch or nurenburg rallies hitler and miss the point. 

Finally, history rhymes but never repeats. Trump's current position is clearly distinct from Hitler or Mussolini, the country is in a different place with different power structures and demographic.

However, trumps rallies, the blind fanatacism of his followers, the corporatist and military cabinet he is assembling, his direct to the people propoganda, attack on news media, use of racial and geographic fault lines, willingness to outright lie, and cult of personality are all concerning. 

The ties with Russia, Russian interference in US politics, and Russian propaganda are not far from Stalins power plays pre WWII. Stalin was pushing communism, Putin Russian imperial greatness.

Furthermore, the discontent, fear, divisiveness, racial tensions etc. all have echoes of 1920s Europe. I think Mussolini is probably not a terrible comparison, he wanted to restore Italy to greatness, rose to power on popular support, suppressed the media, flamboyant cult of personality etc...

In the end Trump is scary because of the echoes of past badness, and not that I see internment camps in the future, or WWIII, but it is important to remember that neither did many in interwar Europe. It is too easy to declare "peace in our time". 

We can assuage our fears with the fact that he has no dogmatic or ideological vision... but we do not know that for certain, at least he has not shared it with us. Also, the people around him definitely do have visions (Pence, Bannon, Flynn) that are scary. 

We can assuage our fears by placing trusts in insitutions, but the bicameral republican control of congress, and their unwillingness to meaningfully challenge Trump or the Hastert rule is not reassuring. The supreme court might soon be stacked with trump appointees rubber stamped by a cowed congress. 

We can say the military will never turn on its own, but the military rank and file was strongly pro trump. Also trump has surrounded himself with respected military men. 

We can that the US presidency on its own is weak, but expanded executive power in the modern presidency, the precedent of war without congressional consent,  and the need for courts and congress to check his power mean trump could do much damage before he can be stopped.

We can say the media will not let the public sit quiet, but trump bypasses the media, has an alternative media in infowars and bretibart. People do not listen to mainstream media but hyperfocused fragmented media sources. 

Furthermore, the media is pared down, local media is decimated, investigative reporting budgets are gone and there are half the reporters of yesteryear; Discussion panels and opinion pieces replaced investigative reporting because it is cheaper. False equivalence reigns. Post Iraq war, the media never recovered their authority.

And look at the alt right, recruiting among disaffected blue collar former middle-class whites, getting rid of silly robes, and buzz cuts for suits and (slightly less ridiculous than shaved heads) metrosexual fashy haircuts. Go over to r/the_donald, the fanatacism is unreal. It is like they are trying on brownshits over there. I think Orwell best captured the appeal of facism to the young and disaffected in his review of mein kempf.

All three of the great dictators [Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin] have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people I offer you a good time, Hitler has said to them I offer you struggle, danger and death, and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years of slaughter and starvation Greatest happiness of the greatest number is a good slogan, but at this moment Better an end with horror than a horror without end is a winner. Now that we are fighting against the man who coined it, we ought not to underrate its emotional appeal.

Trump is not like anything we have seen before, and we used up our rhtoric with hyperbole about past administrations we disagreed with.  We must find a language to discuss the threat and dangers of a trump adminsitration to the future direction of our nation and the material and social well being of all of its citizens. 

America is in a most precipitous situation and the forces of reason, science and modernity have been decimated and barely have the tools to even begin to mount a defense. 

The very enlightenment principles of our founding father are at risk, the invective against blending church and state,  governance based in rational and empirical thought, the rule of law, advancement of science are under attack like nothing seen before (maybe Andrew Jackson but he was different, or since the South seceded).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brifiengs are hard. It's complex info and not predigested by the media or info wars. Sometimes it's info that you have to file away. It's sometimes self contradictory. It does not work with the fact trump is an intellectual lightweight and has no patience for kearning. They are about groups he never heard of in places he can't find on a map with geopolitical forces at play he does not understand and realities he does not want to accept. 

He likes making snap judgements on actionable easy to digest info on topics he understands. He is not interested in heavy cognitive lifting and making weighted difficult decisions with expert input...

Just like his voter base. They also went by what felt right and did not want to do a heavy lift when it came to voting their interests. 

We see this in r/conspiracy and r/the_donald where liberated free thinkers clang their way to conclusions by making rapid intuitive connections (no matter how tenuous) on predigested sources of dubious provenance that fit their preconceived conclusion iften planted by someone else. They don't want to actually do leg work and sift through documents, read advanced expert opinion, etc (real research) but rather "research" aka flop through 4chan, read blog posts, google random info about people and things that don't like and then cherry pick info from sites they like with no critical scrutiny, to make ultimately ridiculous conclusions.

Trump thinks he is smarter than everyone, that he can intuit complex policy decisions using easy predigested info... basically the richer version of r/conspiracy is going to be president... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am sorry, but it is the very people who have been stepped on an overlooked who are going to pay the dearest for this. They are at risk of losing health insurance. They are the most impacted by income inequality. Their schools will be gutted. They won't get retraining programs...

Also read the room and let Bernie have a go? There is no evidence Bernie would have won. But honestly the dems made 3 related mistakes:

* 1) believed that americans would find trump so distasteful as a person they would not vote for him. 
* 2) did not make a case to blue collar fly over country voters why the democrats benefit specifically them
* 3) believed the polls showed them winning and focused on pushing other democraic agendas, getting away from the economy.

In debates Hilary needed to agresssively go after trump on jobs, challenge his knowledge and understanding of policy, pull him into the policy weeds... instead she just went after his character.

Turns out Americans heard Trump's impossible promises at every stop... to back space industry in Florida, coal in Appalachia, shipyards etc. etc.

But people were apathetic too, upset Bernie fans needed to fall in line, 3rd party voters needed to sense the stakes of the election, liberals needed to drag friends to polls, young people needed to be more aggressively recruited. Somehow, people did not appreciate the imminent danger and the stakes of this election. 

So sorry, but Bernie was no saint and savior, and we are now in a massive hole. Time to get off the smug what if wagon and get to explaining to voters in states with senate races in 2 years why dems will help them, and time to groom talent for 4 years from now that can recruit America. 

Also, Biden was the best candidate. My turn-isms greatest victim.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Japanese birth rate/1000: 8
* Japanese death Rate/1000: 9.6
* Fertility rate per woman: 1.4
* Japanese over 60: 33%
* Marriage rate Japan: 60 percent of women and 72 percent of men 30 never married (2005 figures), Japanese don't have many out of wedlock children
* Japan population current: 130 million
* Japan projected 2050: 100.6 million

*edit: Some more thoughts*

Yes, the caricature of basement dwelling dudes marrying their pillows is a gross mischaracterization of a nation. But rigid conservative social norms, high work stress, stagnant economy, lag of living space, high cost of living all contribute to a maladaptive patterns among young Japanese that portend undesirable social and economic trends. It is important for the West to note this because some these trends are developing in the West, more in Europe than the US, but among urban educated Americans too. 

In America, I think it is important for us to ask ourselves if the current income disparity, long work hours, digital distractions, consumer culture etc. are really a healthy and sustainable path forward. These are the hidden costs of underemployment, lack of a safety net, inadequate social services, inadequate minimum wage etc. 

In Europe the equation is different, Germany has tons of social services but they still have an anemic birth rate. One must question if western consumer culture is a possible effect. Regardless, in America the maladaptive patten might be more out of wedlock kids raised in single income  households etc...

Regardless, current realities means people in America don't have the time or money for healthy social relationships, dignified life, healthy living etc. If we raised the minimum wage, single payer healthcare, increased worker protections... people would have healthier relationships, better mental health, healthier lifestyles, and also would help the economy because they would spend money on dinners out, movies, clothes, things for their children, etc... more enterapaneurs because starting a company no longer risks no heath insurance etc...

Japan did the opposite, economy stagnated, they doubled down on corporate culture, long hours, etc. Its not working out for them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Ivankas own business is tiny. Trump said she will run his along with his other children.

2) What else is the prime minister of Japan going to say? His staff did complain about the decorum and handling of the meeting.

3) No one was worried about trump being offensive to the Pakistani PM, it was the opposite.

4) Duterte has authorized murder, just as long as people claim drugs are involved. Also, he is going to sell his country out to China.

5) Taiwan is nothing like Crimea. Think of it as a civil war that never ended, The Taiwanese government used to run China and Taiwan is what is left. Until China's rehabilitation in the 70s, the US considered Taiwan as the one true China. Now it's the reverse. The status quo won't change, but it's a historical/ geopolitical reality in diplomatic relations.

Crimea, also a historically sensitive and complicated reality is different because Ukraine is a sovereign independent nation internationally recognized and Russia grabbed a piece of it because it thought it was entitled to it and and didn't like Ukraines pro west stance, particularly economically because Russia regards it as in its sphere of influence.

China also claims a sphere of influence, the 9 dash policy outlining their claims to the South China Sea outside of any international treaties and norms. The US and regional players have agressively opposed this, sending military vessels and aircraft through the area and arming nations in the area. Duterte, who hates America and is upset that they criticized his murder spree want to buddy up to China and give up the Philippines are the sea to china.

The thing is, trump is likely ignorant to all of these realities. He is just improving along like he always does.

Operating as POETUS requires nuance, subtly, deftness and a good team and listening to experts. Trump is not really doing those things. As for American leaders being trampled that's a fox new talking point. Also, teddy had some good advice that Obama seems to be following. Talk softly and carry a big stick.  </TEXT>

People called Hilary a hawk but he wants Flynn to be the national security advisor, and anti islamist aggressive hawk. 

Clean up Washington? Get rid of wall street croneys? Hire senators and billionaires and a Goldman Sachs and Hollywood affiliated financier to run the treasury.

It's like a joke, trump voters voted for trump for reasons exactly the opposite of what he is going to do. It would be funny if it wasn't so tragic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, polar space launch because aside from the difficulty of handling launch equipment under those conditions it also the least favorable launch location owing to very little assist from earth rotation...

...so you claim the rich are escaping earth from a site where current launch apparatus cannot function, where it's hard to deliver fuel and supplies, where any launch would need tons of fuel because of the unfavorable latitude, to a destination that does not exist because we have not yet developed the technology for long term space inhabitance or interplanetary transit without massive health effects. 

Going to label this one as plausible. 

Edit: before anyone mentions nuke subs with ballistic launches from under ice in arctic, those are small payloads without achieving escape velocity, launched from subs that show up fueled, ready and with climate control on board. A bit different from erecting a man rated launch system in sub zero weather, amid blizzards. Also it's not like the scientists at Amundsen Scott who are largely liberal geogolgists and meteorologist wouldn't notice large scale military proceedings or the scientists and tourists studying penguins and plankton wouldn't notice either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because it's complicated. We sell them arms and have a mutual defence agreement. We maintain their right to be an independent entity. But we agreed with China that we recognize one China, the PRC. 

China is hypocritical on this count too. There are direct flights to Taiwan, business and trade goes on as well. 
However, china sees the nearest islands to its coast as a) their territory b) integral to their defense. And so officially they want Taiwan not be recognized as a separate country for geopolitical and saving face reasons.

They being a large trading partner and nuclear power we humor them because the last time things got heated we deployed 2 carried groups to the region, including one full carrier group and all the escorts transiting the Taiwan straight. Do you know which party was in charge of Taiwan, and under whose leadership they were during that cluster? It was the current leaders father and the same party that just came to power.

This diplomatic spat hampered US-Chinese cooperation and relations for a decade. 

With tensions in the South China Sea and Sea of Japan already high, with North Korea  being itself and the South Koreans in political turmoil, now is not the time to rock the boat diplomatically on the Asia pacific. 

Chinese papers are spinning this as taiwans fault and also getting in jabs at trump as incompetent but things could go worse. 

He already has messed up a call from Pakistan, breached etiquette in his meeting with Japan, involved his children who are to manage his money on calls with foreign leaders, praised duterte's campaign of extrajudicial murder, etc...

It's amateur hour at trump tower. Unfortunately, he is playing big league pro poker with all of our lives, money and reputation at stake. </TEXT>

2) I agree, Melanie trump petition is stupid, a piece regarding concerns regarding the cost and security issues with Melanie staying in NYC would be reasonable. The petition is stupid. Also most of manhattan did not vote for trump so clearly they will be biased.

3) I agree that taking some local Russian politicians stupidity as testimony for Russian intervention in the US election is stretching things. People's concern regarding Russian intervention in US politics and the long term impolicatons is reasonable.

4) Calling Taiwan is a huge deal... sorry no way out of that one. It's a giant geopolitical foot in mouth. It's no 2 dudes having a chat, it POETUS talking to a country we don't formally recognize, then calling out the seeming inconsitincy of our foreign policy on twitter... and generally showing no understanding of the historical and geopolitical forces at work in ASIA.

5) I don't know which issue that specifically references but learning about religions in the setting of history and social studies? Fine as long as it's done empirically and according to secular approaches. Teaching theology on school? Problematic, how to choose which religions, how to do somsensitviely, justifying spending the time on it, taking into considerations athteists etc... it's thorny and has no place in public schools... not a minor issue. Separation of church and state is vitally important.

<TEXT> Europe is too inward looking, it needs to engage the middle east and north Africa culturally using the economic heft of the eurozone. This will have a liberalizing effect on the regions if there is economic improvement and cultural exchange and in return Europe has new markets. A post colonial economic partnership. In isolation Europe will stagnate and is weak against Russian geopolitical games, Chinese investment and economic control, and middle eastern instability. 

Similarly, the US needs to engage latin, central and south america in economic partnerships or we won't solve the immigration issue. Kids from guatemala and honderus want in? who can blame them, if they stay they will be murdered by gangs. 

By raising standards of our neighbors, investing in them, and exchanging culture and technology we grow markets and stabilize regions. 

Otherwise, numerically it is hard to control with an entity like China with 1 billion+ and trying to carve out another 500 million person economic sphere of influence in the South China Sea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Refugees will keep flooding in if the conditions from where they come are so bad that its means they will risk all to make it to Western Europe. Europe needs a more aggressive foreign policy that addresses issues at the source. 

That means European leadership and involvement in Syria, North Africa etc. Sorry dropping a few bombs with the Americans in Syria won't do it. Russia is actively using Syrian refugees to destabilize Europe and Putin is manipulating the Syrian conflict to his benefit.

Europe needs to either aggressively challenge Assad or join Russia and restore him to power. Otherwise, people will keep flooding north. Similarly, working on Libya getting a functioning government to stem the flow across that border etc. 

Europe can deride US interventionist foreign policy all they want but you cannot isolate yourself from regional crises and therefore it is their interest to address them (and maybe have the capability to do so without needing America to hold their hands, and provide weapons/logistics/command and control to do it). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Russia does not have the capability for a true projection of force owing to a lack of a true blue water navy... at best they can reinforce an ally with a protected airbase like Syria where they can base an expeditionary force. 

They do have a large ground force and air force that is a threat to contiguous states, as Ukraine already found out. Russia is also very skilled in special warfare, dis-information and control of separatist groups, like in azerbaijian, moldova and Ukraine. Therefore, they have a huge relatively effective force hey can project from their borders. 

They also have a very large and potent nuclear force with second strike capability in case things get out of hand. 

So yes, the army has issues, is probably aside from a few elite units under trained, much of the equipment is old, logistics is iffy etc.. but there is more than enough bite left to hurt people. 

Therefore, we needed a US President who was adept at countering the high risk aggressive geopolitical games Putin has been playing. 

Instead, we elected Trump. I feel like our Baltic, Polish, Ukrainian, Georgian friends are shitting bricks at the moment. Also, Syria looks like it will likely remain a quagmire, which means continued refugees and further destabilization of Europe.

<TEXT> Basically with the system as is the dems need to regain control of the senate in the short term and the presidency in the near term. To do that they need to convince young people to vote (near impossible historically), explain to white working class voters why their vision of America helps that specific voter, or sway old people (if trump and Ryan go for Medicare quite possible). 

The democrats simply failed to explain to the swing state voter why trumps policies would hurt them and demonstrate that trump's promises were empty. It turns out that the voters didn't care as much that he was a temperamental, mysoginist or rascist. 

And young people did not turn out but that is not new. Too many voters were apathetic in general because he dems allowed the republican driven false equivalence narrative take hold.

The republicans played for keeps, the dems were to busy planning the afterparty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Calling anyone with a different perspective than yours a shill suggests a closed mindedness against the spirit of the sub. It also suggests you have not truly considered others positions. How can you win anyone over if you do not understand their fears, interests, positions? Moreover, how can you be awake or a free thinker without being able to consider the other side? Do you need a safe space and echo chamber? If that's what you want then you are just another sheep, just with a different allegiance than most,  but just as blind and limited. 

If this sub was about intellectual growth, argument, discussion, evidence then maybe people would take the conspiracy theorists more seriously. Until then you are just a contrarian sheep...

I come from the perspective where many I know are still in shock and disbelief about trumps win and are genuinely concerned for the future. Many being well off will weather this ok most likely but they are worried that things they care for will be destroyed. Researchers who need grants, doctors who work with patient with a wide swath socio exonomic back grounds, teachers in the public schools systems etc... and then people who care about advancing knowledge, science or care about civil liberties.

<TEXT> The sub is not pro-hilary so much as terrified by Trumps' plans, cabinet, lack of presidential decorum, opaque finances, conflicts of interest etc...

People are upset because they perceive a false equivalence was drawn between candidates and now that Trump has been elected his predictably unpresidential conduct, unpreparedness, and the right-wing allegiance are manifestly evident. 

I don't by the popular vote argument, Hilary won by a huge margin - true, the electoral college is likely an undemocratic insitution - true, but they were playing a different game and Trump won according to the rules of the contest. 

Also, all this fantasy about recounts, electoral college overriding the vote, and impeachment on day 1 are fanciful liberal coping strategies. Also, if any of things happen it would be terrifying... like riots and violence terrifying. 

But overall, people are concerned that Trump is showing no restraint on Twitter, surrounding himself with a very right wing cast of characters, and showing now understanding of what a blind trust is, conflicts of interest, and emoluments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> what evidence is there that trump is a liberal... he is probably best described as self-serving, but the people who are going to be doing the actual work in his administration are going to rip through every program liberals hold dear and expand the military industrial comlex. 

**His brain trust is republican insiders, conservative billionaires and the military.**

* Pence, VP, head transition team: Very right wing on social and economic issues
* Munchin, sec treasury: Banker, ties to wall street and hollywood
* Sessions, AG: Right wing republican senator
* Tom Price, HHS: Right wing senator, wants to repeal ACA
* Elaine Chao, transportation: Wife of mitch mconnel, sec transporation under bush
* Betsy Davos, education: Pro school vouchers, anti public school, faih based philanthropy, ? vouchers for religous schools
* Priebus, chief of staff: head of RNC, right wing establishment
* Candidates for Sec def, nsc, sec state: Mathis, Flynn, Patreus... not exactly going to be reigning in defence spending.

Nikki Haley is an exception but she is still right wing. 


**The republicans are getting ready to:**

* Repeal ACA
* Privatize medicare
* Cut taxes on the rich, raise taxes on middle class
* Gut public schools
* Stop funding climate research at NASA
* Go after Marijuana on a federal level
* End net neutrality

Under anti muslim sentiment get ready for:

* Patriot Act return
* Torture

Also, conservative on the supreme court will mean:

* Go after Roe V Wade
* No chance to repeal Citizens United

<TEXT> Ok legalization is a socio-economic issue, as is rescheduling, its needs to be legalized because people are using it already, and it benefits no one to put people in jail, strip people of jobs, and ruin chances at future employment particularly among poor and minority youth. 

Also, Marijuana is not harmless, it exacerbates some conditions, causes others (cannabis hyperemesis syndrome) and long term heavy use or use by young people may have long term effects on brain development and function. 

Finally, the cannabanoid system and multiple cannabanoids in Marijuana are poorly understood. While it might make people feel better it is unclear on its affect on long term disease progression and mechanism of action. 

Also, if they can create a non-sedating/ or altering version that would be great from people who cannot get high for work/ personal reasons. 

Using the medical argument for legalization is dangerous. If the studies don't pan out, if they isolate a cannabanoid that is responsible for most effects, it will backfire. 

tl;dr: Medical science is slow for a reason and hawking untested therapies can have long term adverse effects. Marijuana legalization is a socio-economic reason and should not be tied to unporven medical use.  </TEXT>

You are on immune modulating agents because it's an auto immune inflammatory process and these days their are many therapies available with fewer side effects when just relatively recently they had maybe two or three. Immune therapy sucks but it's better than nothing and weed is certainly not an adequate replacement... it's interesting and worth studying but the options for treatment have exploded recently compared to even a decade or two before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> European/Asian heroin from Afghanistan, most US heroin South America. Not sure where synthetics like fentanyl, carfentanyl etc come from.

As for why people use its multifactorial. Some get hooked from prescriptions after one day breaking a leg. 

Others have some poorly defined chronic pain process and some well meaning physician prescribed an opiate... build tolerance and some underlying psych disease and you get an addict.

Teens in Appalachia try it a party and get hooked or sold to them by grandparents looking to supplement social security.

Shitty life, bad support network, mental illness, no job, bad insurance, crappy friends who use, shitty sig other, lower eduvstion, never taught coping skills and the fact that it's very addictive with a terribaly uncomfortable withdrawal means it's hard to quit. 

It messes with reward pathways and decision making even when not high. People sell all their stuff, steal from friends, prostitute themselves to get heroin making life even shittier, digging the hole... hard to clickb out. </TEXT>

how is they anywhere near what Hilary did where she as a civilian unintentionally might have put low grade retroactively classified  info at risk, using a private email like many of her predecessors. Which she did because State department email is slow, clunky and does not work with smartphones and she was trying to get shit done?

<TEXT> The problem is conspiracy theorists can be 100% guaranteed to overlook any real conspiracy especially one that does not fit what is often a weirdly anti establishment but also at the same time authoritarian world view. 

So Russia tampering with elections? Disregard. 

Large corporations spreading anti climate change propaganda and buying off scientists and politicians? Disregard.

Trumps opaque finances possibly threat to national security and interests? Disregard.

Fake news that army drills in Texas operation jade, is really a take over of America, or some guy on 4 chan decided a pizza shop had wierd logo, or the plane overhead is leaving some contrails which must be chemicals? Call to arms... we must expose these conspiracies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole trade package. Trump at every stop would say I am going to tear up nafta. Then he would pick a local industry and say I am going to open this factory again or fund this sector or rebuild the shipyard. In Florida it was NASA, in Indiana it was a carrier plant, in coal country it was the local mine.


 The media covered all the other stuff he said and the things that happened at his rallies. The locals heard trump is bringing back blue collar jobs. Doesn't matter how or if it's possible.

 Meanwhile dems refused to lie outright and talked about education, retraining, taxes and healthcare. All much more abstract. 

Didn't help that 8 years of republican smearing convinced everyone anything Hilary said was a lie... somehow Trumps pathological lying got overlooked and here we are. 

Problem is, with out massive subsidies, even if you get rid of nafta and tpp, not sure how those jobs are supposed to come back... and now what. 

Those people are going to be rather incensed when those factories stay shuttered and those coal mines remain unprofitable and when factories do come back are robotic. When nafta is gone and production grinds to a halt. When Obama care is gone and they are insured. No marijuana for pain control. No clean needles. And tax cuts for the rich. </TEXT>

<TEXT> +/-, you would want nurses, workers, engineers who those that had some management experience and could see the bigger picture too. 

Very specialized people like nurses or workers or engineers don't always translate to good policy makers... sure they might have a more real and immediate sense of the problems but they do not have the training to see things as a broader system, how to organize change, what tools to use. Even doctors who have a slightly broader education and training than say a nurse make generally terrible political leaders, from bill frist, to Carson, to rand and Ron, to stein. Having spent mode of my life around scientists, doctors, engineers and nurses most would not make good political leaders although they are very bright, they are just too narrowly focused.

I do not disagree that lawyers are not better and that a more diverse set of career paths should lead to political roles. Lawyers are an added problem because their idea of truth and reality is based on an artifical legal code based in precedent and philosophy not empirical thinking.

I would also conjecture that we should expect our politicians to be a nerdier less polished lot, with broad credentials and experiences in management etc. 

We need to focus less on who they sleep with, and which church they belong, and if they would be fun to share a  beer with but instead demand clear cut polices and planes and demand the media deconstruct and translate those plans and policies to the American public. 

The American public also needs to get a bit tougher about bad news and actually elect politicians who say things as they are. Trump flying around the country, playing up American exceptionalism and promising to reopen this factory and that ship yard at every stop is also people hearing what they want to hear.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is truth to that, but Cheney after leaving power remained pretty vocal. Cheney believed his neo con agenda. 

I am not a fan of the neocons and they played an aggressive, dangerous and ultimately misguided game. But they are not there same existential threat to our country's institutions as bannon is.

 Bannon is the face of an alternative news distribution network with a fascist/ white supremacist flavor. He is dangerous because he has the connections to bypass the news media and create his own narrative while advancing a very fringe agenda. Sure the bush neocons utilized Fox News in a similar way but business interests and establishment interests served as some check on their activities. Bannon has no such limitations and neither does breitbart/ Alex Jones/ info wars etc. 

So while I do not defend bush neocons and their actions while in power continue to cost America dearly, from tax cuts to the Iraq war, they were not so incompet, unbound and extreme as bannon and ilk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By western standards, we are a den of inequality with massive  differences in outcomes regarding health, life expectancy, educational attainment, employment opportunities etc. based on socioeconomic, regional, and racial divisions. It is kind of why trump won, because many people are feeling left out, they just do not care who else was left out too. 

But also many feel that the gains of women and minorities have come at their expense. There is also a regional divide where they feel the gains of the costal elites have come at their expense as well.  

As for the special snowflakes, many of the Trump voters and the dear leader themselves are the most thin skinned. 

Honestly, all these coal communities and rust belt communities, raised on American exceptionalism and nationalistic fervor, do not want to hear that those opportunities are not coming back. If they do come back the jobs will be automated and require and different skill set than they have. Also if there is a trade war they won't be able to afford any of the products they now take for granted. 

They lost, and the party that told them that were special blocked any attempts to soften the blow, give them a safety net while they retrain. 

I would be fine for them voting their interests except trumps proposals are not going work or help them, and the vitriol they direct at everyone else. Somehow coastal elites and liberals are unamerican in their eyes, interlopers, weak.

When they repeal obama care, slash government programs, roll back medicare, privatize all the infrastructure, they are going to pay most dearly. Kansas is a little experiment that gave us taste of things to come.  </TEXT>

To be fair the public has been demanding coverage of scandal and horse races for years so in some ways the media was doing what people wanted. Also it's cheaper and easier to sit two surrogates on the air and have them argue than to actually do reporting... and as fast a surrogarate like Conway spins lies and deflects, the media does not even try to keep up and fact check. </TEXT>

No one spelled out the way they are doing now what kind of conflicts of interest trump would have but we have known this would happen because trump never promised a blind trust and never released his tax returns. The media never went in depth with trump about how he was to help the working class. The details of his wall. How he was planning to deport all these people. Details of the ACA. No theh never really got past the groping women video and other outrageous things he said... which were already litigated in the publics mind because everyone saw the tweets and video front the horses mouth.  Not saying these were not issues but they were only an easily accessible piece of the picture, they missed the rest lurking below.

<TEXT> His critics go stuck on how terrible he was as a person. Turns out Americans did not care. 

The media never really explored his lack of policy ideas or the fact that he is absolutely ignorant on the issues. They never explained to the average swing state worker why Trump's policies would hurt them. 

Turns out swing state voters don't care about what happens to women/ minorties/ gay couples. 

Also they made a false equivalence with Hilary too. They made Hilary look as corrupt and unethical as trump. Since the media and the Clinton campaign never dug into trumps actual plans or preparedness and hoped trumps despicable persona would do the job.

They underestimated how much the average voter bought into the republican 8 year long anti Hilary hit job and many trump voters also probably were not fans of the big tent dem message.

So people voted to fuck the establishment and for the guy who promised them and their kids jobs. It's the medias fault he was never put on the spot as to how he actually plans to get back jobs...

Oh and then a bunch of Americans sat on their asses. They own this too, dem voters that did not bother to vote own a special place in this cluster fuck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, I think the OP has reduced both complex commentaries on society and the future of society to a black and white simplification.

 Neither writer was completely prescient, nor were they trying to be, they were exploring complex themes about society through the telling of a good story. 

After all, these were novels. For sure, the world of Huxley was hedonistic on the surface, with an underlying artificial and troubling class structure. 

Alternatively, Orwell pictured a surveillance/ propaganda state which also overwhelmed citizens with fake news on one hand and authoritarian enforcement on the other.   

Like the joke,  "history never repeats itself, it does however, occasionally rhyme", similarly I would use literature as a way to explore our existence rather than some blueprint or explicit warning.  </TEXT>

So people ended up overlooking that he is a crook and despicable person and voted because they still believed his non existent policies would help them. No one explained to the rural voter that trump presidency would hurt them personally. </TEXT>

In the meanwhile, its pretty amazing how much damage trump can do I 2 years through executive orders alone... and he has both legislative chanmbers to help him. 

Set backs on climate change, environmental pollution, US geopolitical standing, the economy, and other issues can be hard to undue. For infants, we are still dealing with the sequale of bush era foreign policy. We are still dealing with the sequale of the 2008 crash, the deficits from bush tax cuts and Iraq war spending, etc... a lot can go wrong in 2 years that's not easily fixable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah so:

1) His children still run his company, not a blind trust

2) His children are 1/3 of the leadership of his transition team and his son in law is apparently calling shots on appointments.

3) We have no clue with whom Trump has business dealings because he runs an opaque private organization and has not released his tax returns. 

He could literally owe money or have shared investments with kremlin connected oligarchs, beijing connected Chinese businessmen, etc... and how people beleive that his own interests and his children's interests won't affect his decisions, consciously or unconsciously. Its a conflcit of interest and national security risk. 

Also, I am sure Pakistan loves the fact the Trump is meeting his Indian business partners. The entire situation is downright surreal. 

And all these people were screaming about the nefarious dealings of the Clinton foundation? The hypocrisy and the double standard is insane. God forbid hilary took money to help Haitian children... Trump is taking money to enrich himself and his own directly. 

Why do we think he will treat the federal government any differently than he treated his charity. He is already biliking them for use of his plane, and securing trump tower but the masses are caught up in the measly $400K he will save the government by not drawing a salary... which knowing Trump he might do anyway when all is said and done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's worse than that. His company is not publicly traded and as such does not make disclosures or earning statements or have shareholder meetings. It's not a classic company but more of a holding company for trumps assets and wealth. And since he has not released any tax returns trump's business dealings are completely opaque. 

So not only is there risk for conflict of interest at the least and quid pro quo favors at the worst, but we have not clue who his business dealings are with. So foreign business entities could affect executive branch policy and this could be against us interests or even a security risk.

It's next order of magnitude concerning. What drives me crazy is any concern regarding the Clinton foundation which is a public charity with incredible transparency pales in comparison for this opaque and concerning mess. And trump never promised that he would put his assets in a blind trust so people knowingly voted for this.

After months of ctr accusations make you wonder if these pro trump accounts are fanatics, trolls or worse that we have been had and they are in fact trumps version of ctr or Putins paid posters... that maybe ctr was not so prevalent but the the ctr accusers and trump zealots are actually counter propagandists...  </TEXT>

When pushed he would say the same thing, like he thought it was a policy to bring jobs back, that obama simply needed to get some smart people together, ask them to bring jobs back, and they would order something and jobs would come back... like it was simply obama not realizing we need more good paying jobs in America.

<TEXT> Globalization has been destructive and has hurt many people. Like with any change there are winner and losers. Rural communities, blue collar communities got hit hard when intellectual capital became more valuable than labor. Even modern manufacturing jobs require advanced skills. Now it is fair that we did little to help these people but then again their own elected small government republicans led the charge... because they did not want retraining, the wanted to do the same thing, get paid unrealistically for it, and make sure no one else got to live life any differently then they though right based on their religion and morality. 

And the line the was fed to these communities was that you do not have to change to face these changes. They were told America is great, the greatest in fact and so are you, simply by virtue of being American. And that post cold war industrial boom mixed with heady days of the 90s, that is the norm. It is just the politicians standing in the way of companies that is holding the economy back.

And when that line grew thin they trumped up wedge issues like guns/religion/abortion. And then they depicted the other... women, minorities, illegals. The system they were told favors the other, that is why they suffer.

But no one can deliver on that promise or entitlement... so along comes a demagogue who no longer plays to wedge issues, or blows dog whistles. He promises to roll back the privileges of these others, hold back the international competition, cut taxes, and unleash the corporations. And they vote for him. 

It is all lies, they have been had and while they figure that out, the other they so despise will be hurt, and so will they...

I do not hold these trump supporters so innocent, they either did not care or wanted trumps mysogony/racism/anti-intellecutalism because they wanted what they felt was due to them the rest of the country or world be dammed. 

Agricultural subsidies, mining subsidies, gun laws that make no sense in cities, unde influence religion in our government... we already cater to these dying communities too much. They need to adapt like the rest of us. 

To be fair though we all failed, so we will pay this price together in the worst possible protracted way as this trainwreck of an administration grinds the machinery of government to the ground. </TEXT>

 If the Clinton foundation was accused of pay to play and allowing foreign money to influence us governmental and political decisions, then this set up is an order of magnitude more concerning... 

Especially, considering his empire being private corporations is completely opaque and he never released his tax returns.

His financial well being might already be dependent on Russian and Chinese money. Not to mention his kids are already a major part of his transition team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well stein is also clueless and underinformed, with no policy substance or realistic understanding economy, so keep wearing that chip on your shoulder with pride. 

But to be honest a not an insubstantial portion of the population has been wound up with cries of American exceptionalism and are demanding an authoritarian to return them to dominance in the country... without any change or adaptation on their part to the modern socioeconomic equation. They want a return to when they had no competition, america dominated world markets, and they did not have to deal with gay people, women in charge, minorities, etc, and they picked a guy who promised to strong arm those changes for them democracy or facts be damned. 

Sorry but coal is not coming back, neither is manufacturing and their kids are still going to do heroin... </TEXT>

<TEXT> They had less time with Obama and he had less of a political history. Also if that is the bar, to be as squeaky clean as Obama, we will dismiss a lot of qualified candidates. Obama literally has an antiseptic past and no one hacked his emails either.  I am sorry but a part of this narrative is that we let the republican pundit class and slander machine create the narrative and facts of this elections and the rest of the media lapped it up. Furthermore, it is insane that somehow the fact that trump is a hugely flawed human being was completely overlooked.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In an industrial society like 1918 able bodied men were valuable on average if you look at their future productivity. Also people maimed and injured are a long term cost. 55,000 able bodied men is the workforce of a large town... that is a huge expenditure, especially as they had been raised, so capital was sunk and there was no return yet. 

If we take modern numbers, a person has on average say low-ball $6-8 million lifetime productivity, that is 330-450 million in productivity, not to mention the lost productivity of their offspring less the costs of their training. Unlikely that those few miles would produce anything near that for a long time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> we let the republican slander machine erode at her for years and let them supplant reality with this some fact-free version of it, and if you think they wont do it to all future liberal or opposition candidates you are mistaken.

 Its important we take a stand against the fact that we allowed and stood by while this happened. Hilary had her flaws but was not what she was projected to be. 

Unless we take a stand against sensationalist media coverage, false equivalency,  and a rejection of expert opinion we are screwed... this extends to issues too. 

We cannot get acceptance of climate change which is backed by an insane scientific consensus let alone anything actually controversial. That is a big part of this election too. Boring, fact-driven, nuanced approaches and candidates need to be ok again... until then we will vacillate between demagogues and  strong men.  </TEXT>

If mccain after being belittled by trump in the most personal way or ryan after literally deeming trump a despicable human being could swallow their pride and back him, the large majority of establishment republicans are going to fall in line. Its also not an insubstantial portion of the republican primary electorate that supports him so they also cannot toe the line against trump too much either.  </TEXT>
