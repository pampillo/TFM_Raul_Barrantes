<TEXT> I got from g5 to plat in 1 week in my first season (6) playing only Sona. Now I play mostly Zyra sup and I'm p2 (trying to get dia). Counters don't matter so much in the lower ratings, just picks champs that you like and are at least OK (don't play terrible champs with 40% winrates if you want to climb easily).

About being stuck: You have to realize what is your problem. Is it you? Are you winning your lane most of the matches? If no, are you more usefull in teamfights than your lane opponent? If you own your lane opponent in most of matches and make no use of it it's also mistake. Make cs lead, try to get 1-2 kills on him, push lane and roam to use your strength around the map. 

If you want to learn about specific champs i suggest to watch video of one-trick-ponies of them on youtube or twitch.

If you want to get general-knowledge about game I recommend series from: https://www.youtube.com/user/HuzzyGames/videos (Unranked to Diamond) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I often use sounds from websites like http://www.freesfx.co.uk/  and add notes about them in credits. Just google free sounds / music and you will find a lot of them. When you use sounds take a look at license if it is something like cc0 or cc-by (need for credit) etc.
For music this is great site: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good link. I should say it another way: I would like everything to be specified (In ideal world it would be), but people like to misuse things, so it can create more bad than good. If it was just another layer of confidence that you know that if it works here with this order it will work with another compiler with the same order then it would be great. But in real world people will try to use it making "compact code", that will be hard to read and without composition cos you cannot take arguments out or change their order without breaking things.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are just getting into game development then you will make it with unity a lot quicker. It was designed for 3D, but there are lot of games for 2D, so you can do that. However if you want to make more games over time you may consider learning java/c++. You can still make great games with unity, but if you want to have more control over your game or make some advanced stuff you will need to do it with native platform code. So to sum up, try unity, if you grow big you may easily use something else later, if u start with hard stuff you may spend 1 year learning and making your game to just discover that you failed because you didn't promote it well or something else. Better to start with few small titles and build your success over time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And the amount of optimization an app has on an ios device is leagues beyond most Android devices. This is probably the biggest benefit Apple has by making the OS so closed off.

It's kinda opposite. Closing system in this case doesn't make it optimized, TBH it makes iOS less optimized. If the system was open you could look into source code and look how things works internally to make your code perform better. Also if it was open you could use JITs instead of interpreted code for things like Lua, custom Javascript implementations etc (you can use only Apple JIT for Javascript in their closed system). List can go on. What makes these apps run faster than most of Android devices are native code, thread management and usually better hardware than avarage Android Device (You usually don't buy iphone for 50$, thats what I mean with better hardware). Also native code usage was more important few years ago before Android 2.2 with JIT and Android 5.0 with ART, now it's mostly mix of hardware + system design.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also thought about 'choice of' games. Base idea is similar (text rpg with options), but it looks that /u/JManoclay did a bit of improvement here. The way how you interact with app helps you "be more in it". I know it's just text rpg, but details like clicking stuff in text instead of just "texta area on top and few buttons on bottom", make things more enjoyable. It's good textrpg, but kinda short tbh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, if you already know Android it will be 'cost-efficient' to learn iOS Dev, lot of things are similar and in very short time you will something like 2x possible jobs to take.

If you want to stay with Android (because you don't have iDevice or you just hate apple), then you should get familiar with NDK and Xamarin, when I look for jobs on freelancing sites there are a lot of people that now Android as you say, but they just know how to use Java/Cordova/etc for the most typical apps like chats/social/news... When job need more skilled developer (for NDK/C or for example audio processing(but not just playing audio but doing something more 'lowlevel')) then 90% of these people cannot take these jobs. 

So to sum it up, learn NDK and specialize in some field like audio processing or opencv/AR (there are a lot of jobs with lower numbers of freelancers applying for them). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idea is good but graphics may be turn-off. People went outside for pokemons because they are cute, people associate emotions from childhood with them etc. Look at ingress, many people think it is better game than pokemongo, they had even more money than you to polish and promote it and still it wasn't so popular. Some people will just like me look at this game just to check what it is and then leave it, because there is not so much to achieve/be excited for. As I wrote idea is good, but you need much more content and maybe gameplay? or something else to make people fall in love in it just like pokemongo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi I haven't build PC for few years so I got a bit rusty and my knowledge may be outdated. I have drives, monitor, mouse, kb so I need only core parts. I need PC for gaming and programming (so I prefer reliability over performance). I'll OC a bit in future.

I prefer Gigabyte over Asus cos It never let me down and I like black   red color theme ;)

I don't have cooler cos I'll have CPU box, I'll buy it in case of OC.

Is there anything bad in my build?

Thank you for your tips!

<TEXT> Lua 5.1 as target may be better, because it's more widely used, also LuaJIT is mostly compatible with this version.

I think that book from Lua's creator is easy at all, so if you want to make something easier, then maybe make something for kids. For example writing games with LVE (+ setup etc), it may be more entertaining then playing with console that usually most people are scared of and when they see it they run away (anxiety is not so good for learning ;p).

<TEXT> Hi!
We made game for Windows Phone (WP8+), it's retro-style tamagotchi-like virtual pet simulator.

Link to the game: http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=e68449e2-e12c-49b7-b2d8-03d5d12f6c8a

Users from previous platforms like this game so I hope WP users also will like it ;)

Thank you for any feedback and downloads. Please post review/rating if you like the game, it's really helpful.

Dev info -
We are indie devs - I'm programmer, my GF made graphics for pets foods.

Nerd info ;) -
I use my own engine in which I make games mostly using Lua. It's mix of C/C++, Java , Obj-C, Lua   now also some CX/C++   C#. Previously I had games only for Android   iOS but I added support for WP so now I plan to make games for 3 platforms at once. Because engine was OpenGL-based I used angleproject to wrap DX calls and anyway performance is good enough. So if anyone here wants to port iOS/Android OpenGL-based game to WP then I may give some tips about angleproject and other porting-related things.

Kind regards,
Janusz </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow. Honest review.

* I may add it, at all it make sense to allow everybody name the pet however he/she wants.

* Sound can be disabled/enabled in settings. I used http://www.bfxr.net/ it looks almost the same.

* I personally like fullscreen games, but I'll try to solve it by adding option in settings to enable/disable fullscreen.

* I did it 'by design' to all games that have arrows. I thought that it is better. I'll review all games and reconsider it.

* Good point. It may be nice to blink 1 or 2 times.

Thank you for all these notes! They are really helpful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are no IAP. Maybe I'll add later something like 'unlock all pets' for inpatient ppl, but at all I don't want it to be coins-grinding game. 

Auto-jump: not everyone is good in jumping, I saw that majority of casual gamers found it easier to jump on click, so it is a bit problematic case ;) but I think that there are few games that are more challenging (panda has easy games, wolf has harder).

<TEXT> Your article is full of passion but it's little pessimistic. You don't need so big marketing budget to achieve your goals. If you believe in your skill and have really good idea you may start kickstarter campaign. It will give you money and what is important may give you huge marketing boost. Lot of ppl without money achieve something with help of it. 

Anyway emotional / idealistic part of article is good and I think that there are a lot of devs that spend even more thatn 14h/day in front of monitor ;) </TEXT>

Game is valid and logic is good but, everything else is lacking. Your icon is just gradient. I see that you made few games. I see that you take them to the level of good tutorial and then you leave them, you should put more heart and work into them make something bigger (it doesn't mean complicated, it means polished).

I was nerd with 0 graphics skills so I know that you just don't want to make graphics and keep coding but this link may be helpful to you: http://2dgameartforprogrammers.blogspot.com/ Almost everyone today can make graphics applicable to mobile casual games after some praticing and this blog should be your first step. Of course the better way would be finding some with art skill and make something together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By 'not so good' I mean 'harder'. You can simply workaround for example making texture atlases with packer in runtime with somehow bound images, but it's not so popular and I haven't seen engines that offer such a functionality (at all most of engies are not vector graphics oriented) so you would have to implement it on your own (anyway this one is not so huge problem). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pitfalls:

- it's not so good for making texture atlases, it has noticable impact on performance

- may increase launch time because you have to generate bitmaps from svg, especially on mobile devices

- not good for some types of games for example retro/8bit

Otherwise it is good in terms of productivity cos you don't have to make mipmaps or specialised assets for different screens etc. So in my opinion if you don't need texture atlases and vector graphic suits your game then it's good choice if properly done.

<TEXT> I've used a lot of engines and red source code of few of them. I also wrote my own desktop/ios/android crossplatform Lua-oriented engine with api based on LibGDX so I may wrote from 2 perspectives. 

LibGDX - for 2d games it is the best engine and it's not so hard as everybody says (It was my first engine and I used it when I had low Java knowledge). It has great community and docs. You may use the same code for desktop/android/etc so you have faster prototyping. It may also be used on iOS with RoboVM. 
It may be used for 3d also. You code with this engine in Java (but it has itself some parts written in native code for better performance), at all you may code in lot of JVM-based languages (I've seend scala   clojure tuts for libgdx).

Andengine - it is easier than libgdx but it's android-only and it has worse performance, docs, community so at all even if it is more 'high level' it may be harder to write without lot of tutorials etc. It's also Java-based.

Cocos2dx - When I used it year ago it was buggy and ugly (it's too objective c'ish, it's just so unnatural to write releases when you have RAII in c++ / all these CC prefixes etc, ugh). I belive that it's good option only if you are familiar with Cocos2d. You have to code in c/c++ so you will have additional NDK-related problems.

Unity 3D - if you like it (there are a lot of ppl that just don't like making whole-coded games) it's the best option for 3D in terms of productivity.

Corona SDK - with basic package it is good only for simple games. You cannot use custom native libs until you have pro option. Coded in Lua, it's really simple but if there is no something (for example custom ad network) then you can do nothing.

"Custom engine" - I wanted to code in Lua insted of Java for better expressiveness and more productivity (it's case only for alone developer, big Lua project + big team = usually big distaster). I've wanted also to eleminate Garbage Collection problems that Java cause in games (You may use pools but you have to remember about it and it consumes some time, and may also force weird architecture decisions on you). GC is not so much problem in Dalvik in most cases (it was on 2.x Androids) but anyway I like to have more control about GC. Of course you don't have GC problems when you code in C++ but then you have to care more about memory management. 
Writing you own engine at all is not so good option unless it gives you more fun than writing game itself. It costs you a lot of time that you may invest into making one or few games so to sum things up with current options it's good for your education/skills (it requires knowledge in almost every aspect of CS) but it will hurt your money/efficiency. </TEXT>

<TEXT>     AdRequest request = new AdRequest();
    adView.loadAd(request);

Try this, it's older method. Maybe new one is bugged somehow. Check your permissions and activites in manifest (anyway it should crush with another exception instead of NullPointerException if that's case). Look into logs before error, SDKs often give more verbose info there. Adding ads is straightforward it has to be subtle mistake.

BTW consider SMART_BANNER instead of BANNER. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As you know Java apps on PC run on Java virtual machine. Android apps runs on Dalvik VM (you write them in Java then Java bytecode is translated to dalvik bytecode), for simplicity you may think about Dalvik as Java VM optimized for mobile devices. That's why you use Java as default language, it is why ppl tell apps written in Java as native apps, cos Android was designed to use apps written in Java primarily. Original Java VM can use not only Java but also native code (for example C) via JNI, this feature was also added to Dalvik and you use it with help of NDK. So you have Android SDK for apps in Java and Android NDK for c/c++ support in your app (it's harder than java development so learn that later). Other solutions are apps like 'webpage' in WebView that are just pages trying to be apps (here you can use HTML etc), there are also other frameworks that may use Python/Lua code and change app via exposed API, there are also solutions based on translating for example ruby to native projects. Another solution is running any JVM-based language as 'Java' apps for example Scala or Clojure. So to sum things up, you have full freedom, but for begging choose Java if you are familiar with this language or other easy frameworks based on Javascript if you have problems with Java, it's somehow problem of preferences. Personally I'd go with Java at start cos for me it's easier to fight with language than with tools and for Java for Android you have much more tutorials and better IDE support. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's easy, there are a lot of tutorials on web. Start with tutorial for android 'hello world' then move on to UI (buttons, xml-based designer, etc) then move to more advanced topics like multithreading (async tasks), then probably you will do concrette app so you will have to get specialized knowledge, for example about Android audio (MediaPlayer, AudioTrack etc). I also recommend you to get familiar with Android NDK when you learn enough about advanced topics.

If you don't want to develop in Java you may also do something in frameworks based on HTML/javascript that are usually easier than native development. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 30% is enough for me to support (I usually support Android 2.2), these users may be useful in fist month when you want to be in top new free, there every user counts because it takes you higher what gives again more organic downloads etc etc.

If you don't have good reason to drop support for old Android don't do that. From your message I assume that your only problem is memory and probably you want to use android:largeHeap="true" in your manifest. So do it, it will apply to Android 3+. For older version (check android api version at runtime) use VMRuntime.getRuntime().setMinimumHeapSize(SIZE), it's deprecated, but it should be good for old devices, so use it only when you check that API version is low enough. Also if you know when your app need lot of memory you may try/catch OutOfMemoryError, do System.gc() and retry.

Anyway my advice is for free apps, people with old Androids wouldn't pay you so you may go with 4.0+ then.

<TEXT> It depends.

For basic usage it's really simple,something like 2/10.

Because it's simple language for more advanced things like OOP or making bindings to C you need some knowledge so then it's like 7/10. </TEXT>
