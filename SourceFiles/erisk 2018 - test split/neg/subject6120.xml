<TEXT> I mean a little less dry than that :-) use the porn video as a frame for what is described, e. g.:

He sits on her face and yells "lick my ass!"

She is taken aback, was not expecting the sudden change in tone of their sexual encounter, but starts licking... both afraid and excited.

She feels her hips being lifted, even as puts on more weight on her face. Forcing her tongue into his asshole.

She feels a finger being inserted in her moist cunt, then another, and another - three fingers! - but before she could get over this amazement, he starts to insert another...

<TEXT> Definitely. The actions taken by Trump, his admin, the GOP, and the people that have been fighting to be seen with Trump, it's something that I only have ever seen from those in control of 3rd World Countries. 

It's disturbing because it represents a devolution from the norm in how US politics, politicians, and power mongers operate.

Whereas before the impact and influence of these people are at least curbed since they also had that invisible line that represents what is acceptable and therefore should not be seen as crossing, that line has since faded if not totally erased. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you hire a lawyer to setup a trust with the insurance payout? The trust could then give her a monthly payout until it runs out. 

Alternatively after X years, the trust could award her the remaining amount. Make X long enough that she's close to retirement when it happens (20 - 25 years?) this way she would be older and hopefully be more mature.

I think your wife will need to work still but at the very least will have that minimum monthly income if she loses her job etc.

If you can: don't tell her how much she's about to receive. Uncertainty could make her be more conservative about money.

Good luck man. Whatever is left of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Politics is relationship, but I think past a certain point, that relationship should be extended to the constituents - not just to the people that could afford to walk and brush shoulder with those on power. 

Obama's (and I mean to include his administration) performance is phenomenal, especially given the shit show it got handed from the get go, but it is not perfect and immune to criticisms. In fact it should be criticized as it could serve as points to cover for the incoming administration --- but let's be honest with those criticisms, be factual, and be able to compare without bias against the plans and policies that Trump, et al., aims to bring online. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever heard of the phrase: when the US gets a cold, the world gets the flu?

But even if we discount this point, complaining in the face of overall progressive results is just nit-picking (at the least) and outright misleading regarding Obama and his administration's performance - it's a caricature of the Asian parent finding fault after their kid brings home A's -- "This is not an A+, you've been slacking off, you're grounded!"

This economy and policies that have been put in place, it had barely paid off its dividends. But it has started paying off. T

To regress and overhaul just because it was what delivered by Obama and does not fall in line with the vision and plans of GOP and Trump's cronies is not just wasteful, it's downright retarded and irresponsible.

<TEXT> That's your response? Look at the negatives? 

Obama's administration saved the world economy, improved American lives, and restored the world's faith in the US. This despite the obstruction thrown by the Republicans.

You're basically complaining about not being able to dunk this big fucking cookie that Obama somehow was able to hand over to you, into your warm glass of milk.

You can't possibly be that shortsighted. 

Now the US has Trump, and each one of those progress made is about to be reversed - and then some... maybe you could blame this fuckup on Obama... </TEXT>

But he could easily flip and say "I'm a businessman, no need to be petty or emotional! Let's see what they can offer..." 

Trump's supporters and GOP will lap it up either way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure if you are trolling at this point. 

But just look at the news, look at what he's doing now (what he's been doing during the campaigns), is this seriously someone you think would be competent or has enough integrity to follow through with his words to serve the people?

Look at this example: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-foundation-money-claims_us_58627534e4b0d9a59459096a - you could easily verify this yourself.

The terrible thing about this is not the lie. That's the least of it. The terrible thing is that this type of behavior isn't an exception for Trump, it's his normal. 

So back to my question: why Trump?  </TEXT>

Serious question though: why Trump? 

Every rhetoric and actions he's done so far does not look like it would be to the benefit of people like you (or us) or the world itself. And if we're talking personality (say vs Hillary) Trump isn't exactly a good choice objectively. We're not even discussing fitness for office of POTUS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not saying it was fair.

But Gates was a relentless, single-minded, and effective player. A technocrat too boot. Jobs would have loved to be in that position then, and for a time he was when he came back to Apple. Ballmer just didn't have the taste (like Jobs did) or innate sense of tech (like Gates) which I think contributed to MSFTs stagnation in the early 00's

Post MSFT, Gates just changed focus. But he's still applying the same sense of purpose and will, but this time around to distributing back the billions he amassed in a very productive and effective way. 

Not something we can envision Jobs doing, nor Ballmer. So in the balance of things, if there is good and evil, I think Gayes falls in the former category. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obama's administration got a lot done and started. Would have done more if the Republican's weren't hell-bent on obstruction every step of the way.

Progress on various fronts: healthcare, marriage equality, weed legalization, rebooting relationships with Cuba, destabilization of ISIS - just to name a few. We could have thrown in shutting down Guantanamo as well, but it was cockblocked each time it was on the table...

There are some issues that his administration fucked up to: NSA v Snowden is one of the biggest IMO... however all or most of the issues tackled and their approach was progressive and meant to help the country.

Trump's administration on the other hand, just from the looks of his appointments we can easily argue or point as either regressive, self-serving, or both.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope you and everyone here is right about this. But the level of delusion the Trump supporters are in from what I have observed during the campaign alone makes it a very fickle hope. 

They remind me of people who have done so badly at life and was offered or found religion. Every good thing that happens to then from now on they would believe is because of Trump, no matter the evidence, reason, or logic behind it. And every bad thing that would befall them and the country, will never be because of Trump, his policies, and allies. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for the title of a graphic novel; the plot is about a smart home schooled boy whose parents died in a car accident. [more inside] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-02 07:06:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Anyway at the scene of the accident we see that the parents were robots. But in some frames they appear to be just regular dead bodies - suggesting maybe that part of what we see in the story is from the POV of the boy. 

Other hints that might help: 
The story opens with a superhero type character fighting robots and later on switches to the boy waking up - again suggesting that it (the robots, etc) was his dream or fantasy.

There's another superhero type that appears. He seems to be guarding the boy and is after the other superhero. Yet in some frames, we see them (the superheros) as just graffiti or graphics in a van --- again a suggestion that they might not be real.

Thanks for the help.

<TEXT> That dividing line exists for us too. The unspoken rule was you shouldn't eat something you've given a name. 

So I had a pet dog growing up, but my father or his friends would not have seen it as food. 

The thing in the US (or the West) is that they treat pets like one of their children - which was weird for me in the beginning. People would be talking about what they did with someone over the weekend and it takes a minute or so before I realize they are talking about their cat.

I think I still see that line, but I don't think I'll cross it again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wonder why no one just tries to take Kim out. 

If it feels like the situation is hopeless since you lose if you escape (your family hauled to the camps) and you lose if you don't (you get executed) then it looks like the next best thing is to take out the person that is the cause of your miseries... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of it was, and part of it was not. Germany was fucked over after WWI - which never ended, merely paused. Japan had imperial ambitions (which was true for most advanced nations in those era) - none of which is evil by itself, but the means were. Or at least ruthless (it had to be)

Saying the US went to war to stomp out evil is simplistic at best. You could even say that statement is egotistical. 

It went to war to protect itself and its interest which include its allies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. Some wars you have to fight. 

Marking them as evil simplifies motivations to black and white and fail to solve or reduce the chances of the same things from happening again.

Breaking their appetite for wars does not mean they won't go for it again. Just that they'd think long and hard before they do, and hopefully their populace raise questions whether it would be just for them to go into. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I loved most/all of SK's earlier books (anything before the 90's)

Try reading any of these after: Christine, FireStarter, and Cujo. Just like you described Pet Sematary, the horror in these books aren't in the supernatural and is centered around the personalities and emotions of the characters in the stories.

The last and most recent SK book I read was Dr. Sleep - here it seems/reads like he's back to old form. I finished it in 5 days and while not exactly a "can't put down", I couldn't stay away from it for too long.

The main character is dealing with alcoholism and the destruction and pain it causes; I could've skipped reading the "horror" parts and it would've still been a good read. 

This book feels like it's autobiographical, and felt all the more sincere.

EDIT: Added 3 more paragraphs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 20 would've been better. Should've just dropped one a day until Japan's high-command itself reached out and offered unconditional surrender.

Those 2 bombs were not enough punishment for the amount of destruction and misery that Japan dealt out to the Pacific nations.

As such, 2 was merciful and measured. </TEXT>

A joke based on this word:

Q: What's the English word for "amok"
A: "osquito"

Explanation: "lamok" is the Tagalog word for "mosquito"

Edit: additionally, the word "juramentado" is used in place. Almost everyone thinks it's Tagalog, but is likely Spanish (at least in origin) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Time to move. 

They might counter but the salary jump from moving to a new job can be hard to match, the only plus with staying is you know the people you work with and presumably you like the people you work with. 

In my experience (20+ years) it's almost always better to move. If you're good with your current employer, you now have them as a valuable node in your professional network (at the very least)

I did notice some xenophobia, but mostly from younger men (this was early 2000s) - I'd be on a date with a Hungarian girl and some Hungarian guy would try to chat her up in Magyar, without even acknowledging me - it happened maybe 4 or 5 separate times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought it was his most terrible. 

It really just read like someone's tidbit on things they picked up on their visit to Italy. It seemed almost pointless - I stopped being on the lookout for Grisham's book after that; my girlfriend back then was speculating that maybe Grisham just got to the point where he just hired a writing team and all he does is give a plot outline and affix his name once the book is written. 

Three of his earlier ones I thought were good though: A Time to Kill, The Firm, and The Rainmaker.

<TEXT> Actually fines reduce these from happening. 

If a bank is fined every time there is a leak or breach of their customer's account, you can bet your ass it'll be a much rarer event. 

SaaS providers, like Steam, no matter how charismatic their CEO's are, should step up and be compelled (via fines and other means) to protect their customer's data. An empty promise like "We will not share your data" is not enough.

Hopefully Steam is fined for these, not just face a class action suit, as it might pave the way for laws or regulations that will improve the way businesses "protects" their customer's data. </TEXT>

But I wouldn't be thinking about suing them. I'd expect that they get a slap in the wrist - which would piss me of even more, because they lengthened my commute by 15 minutes or so, but I'd be horrified if anybody pushes for more severe forms of punishment.

Caning would be acceptable, he'll recover from it. Unfortunately we don't have it. 

Multiple lawsuits and/or 6 months in jail - that would be fucked up. Considering people at most just got inconvenienced.

<TEXT> Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy while not straightforward is comprehensible. 

You have to pay close attention though, and work to keep the threads you've untangled so far. And if you've done this, at the end of the movie, when everything is laid bare, you get the satisfaction of having unravelled parts, or if you were really astute, most or all of the mysteries and sub-mysteries that drove the story.

There's some movies however that are convoluted just for the sake of; Mulholland Drive comes to mind. Everyone seems to love it and claims it's a wonderful mind-fuck - but I think the writer/director just really did not have a story to tell: just finely crafted scenes/vignettes (which are all weird and memorable) - but as a whole, totally worthless and might as well be random. </TEXT>

Ended up chatting with a female employee from Croatia which eventually turned into a make out session and progressed from there.

Fucked behind the bar, behind the sofa in the lobby, the elevator, the hallway to her room, the odd waiting area in the hallway - we never got to her room (she had a roommate) - so finished there and fucked some more. 

Went back to my room with a shit eating grin. </TEXT>

"I don't know" would have been 10x better response and less suspect. 

"Are they okay?" 100x.

"I got stung by a wasp, are they okay?" 1000x.

Getting stung by a wasp was an excuse, after he found out how grave the injury he caused to "teach a lesson".  

It's perfect, no one will ever find the wasp, and he could claim later that he thought he got stung when it turns out he does not have and wasp related injury. 

It's unfortunate that wrongdoing on his part cannot be proven, because now he know he can get away with it again. </TEXT>

Either way would you like to be the target of this guys rage if he's got a gun? He's a marine, there's a high chance he had a gun in his vehicle. 

And the point was this: uncontrollable rage with or without a weapon from a tool like this should be taken seriously and punished harshly. 

A prison term would reduce his chances of ever owning a gun legally, and deter him from a similar behavior in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Exorcist had this very brief scene showing the statue of the Virgin Mary beheaded and sporting makeshift tits. 

13 year old Catholic me was horrified by it, even when I eventually shed off religion. It was even more disturbing than seeing the Linda Blair fuck herself bloody with a crucifix screaming "Fuck me Jesus, Fuck Me!"

In the book, which I read before the movie - for some reason the crucifix masturbation scene was somewhat more disturbing.

William Peter Blatty is very hard to top.

The U.S. became a world power, and honestly I can't think of a better nation to wield this position. I'm not saying this because I'm pro U.S. but because the U.S. is a country of immigrants, any significant group of which could pose as an argument against the U.S. going to war against their own homelands or their friends' - it does not always work out that way, but it does put a counter-balance against the type of behavior we see from nations that do not have significant immigrant population or cultural makeup as the U.S. </TEXT>

- restored the worlds respect in the U.S.
- passed the affordable care act (perfect if only congress hadn't hobbled it)
- major and hopefully lasting victories in the gay rights movement 
- financial reforms (again hobbled by republican congress and crony)
- demolished the taliban 
- improved the economy
- improved the mix of supreme court 

he had some fuck ups too, but if you tally his wins and losses, I think it's easy to argue that he did a lot of good as POTUS

he's got one more year left - and seeing that he has nothing to lose anymore, one could hope that he would swing for the rafters and tackle issues traditionally considered risqu by politicians. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you can work on it in reverse: draw the outline of the shadow you want to project first; then position the light source; then use whatever material you need (crumpled pieces of paper or Lego blocks) to block the light, taking care not to project any shadows outside or past your outline as you try to fill it.

Bonus point for using as few pieces as possible.

Artsy Fartsy points if you use materials that relate to the shadow image you are projecting (eg, bullets and guns and pills and cash to project the shadow of a man in prison) </TEXT>

Likewise an embryo or fetus up to a certain point is just that: alive, not aware, no self, and more of an automata than a person.

As science moves toward, we'll likely discover when awareness happens, and we would no longer apply arbitrary points in time to determine when abortion crosses ethical boundaries.

Simply banning it causes a lot of issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Easy availability of gun is to blame. And it doesn't help that there's always huge opposition from gun lobbyist and owners everytime there's a move to curb it.

It's a simple equation: more guns available equals more gun deaths. We've seen the opposite is also true in Australia, Japan, London...

More gun deaths from cops too because the have to assume you have a gun and might use it even if you're being arrested for a non-violent infraction.

Gun control makes sense. We just need to move away from the emotional or patriotic arguments for it for about to see it clearly.

(and now I've pulled away from the real story: the untimely death of someone's daughter) </TEXT>

For a quick fun read that's also well done, look up John Birmingham's Axis of Time Trilogy.

Greg Bear's Quantico and it's sequel Mariposa is also good. Near future, hard(ish) sci-fi. Can't complain about the writing style as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The books is badly written. Maybe it's well researched, but the dialog and monologues are cringe inducing. I'm almost 90% done and I just gave up on it not caring what happens to everyone.

However this is one of those books that would lend itself well on screen. So the movie might actually be better.

Thinking about it now, the way it was written, feels like it was done by someone whose main mode of entertainment is the movies and probably the reason why it's a very stilted read (same way that reading the script of a good movie feels rather lackluster) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember this one time, a friend of mine asked me if I've ever fucked a cow, and I said "Are you fucking insane?!"

"Oh, no no no, it's good you gotta try it man!"

"What about the horns?" I asked. "Those things, short as they are they could fuck you up bad!"

"Don't worry man, I could hold them for you, make sure the cow can't move her head."

And so we went to this cow that he's been seeing regularly. He got in front of it and held its horns while I do my business from behind.

It was good. 

And when I was almost there I said, "Let her horns go!" 

"I can't, you'll get gored!"

I said: "Fuck that noise! let it go so I can give it a kiss!"

<TEXT> we visited last year and discovered cacaolat. we liked it so much we brought back two 6-pack packages of it.

we're down to the last bottle :-( and can't find it anywhere in the US or websites that sell international grocery products. 

does anyone have any advice on how i could get more of it? 
would anyone here be willing to purchase and ship it over to me? (i'll pay of course)

thanks!
