<TEXT> I'm shocked but I think I understand. Thank god you were here to help. You are saying that the man may not be a ghost at all. This man may be a living, normal human who purchased my home after me and my wife died, and we are the ghosts. I'm not sure how it happened, I can't remember when we transitioned to the afterlife. Now that it's dawned on me my world has definitely changed into a darker, shadowy realm. Thank you for your guidance, I must make the rest of my journey alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a victim of workplace bullying and the only film that can help me relax was this movie that they showed on VHS in the common room when I was in the ward. I watched it 100s of times but the beginning with the title was cut off and we weren't allowed to see the cassette. I'm out now and trying to find it. There were these little flying robots in an old apartment building, one of them got cooked on the grill like a hamburger! They cut the title off because one of the other patients would become enraged if the saw the name Hume, so one of the people in it was called that, if it helps. Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a producer and I'm thinking about making a movie about workplace bullying about my experiences. I work in a somewhat hostile workplace. It's an office setting but I think it is unusual in the large number of bad people who work there. One morning I woke up and decided I wasn't going to take it anymore, so I set out to make things right. The first bully was Walter. He bullied everyone by hanging out in the mens bathroom all day and making horrid noises and odors. Every time I tried to use the bathroom he was in there. He told me once that he had an irritable bowel, but I know he thinks it's so funny to make people hear and smell gross things. Sure enough he was in a stall when I came in. I figured, if he wants to be in the stall, he should have some reading material. I banged on the stall door and he asked what was the problem, so i said "i got the newspaper for you, hot off the presses!", then I lit the newspaper on fire and threw it over the stall door and ran out. Next time he wants to hang out in the stall all day, he'll surely remember this incident. The next bully was Greg. Greg was the work gym bully. He is 60-70 years old but insists on standing around naked in the mens locker room, forcing everyone to see him nude. It's a real passive aggressive bullying behavior. Outside the gym was a pile of pulled weeds that some gardeners were working on. I took a large handful of weeds and dirt on my way into the gym. I went into the locker room and he was just getting out of the shower. I yelled "hey Greg, welcome to the garden of Eden!" And jammed the handful of weeds in his face! He started yelling and lashing out at me so I ran out, bullies can turn to violence to abuse others and I didn't want to risk injury. There were more bullies I stood up to, but I don't want to make a wall of text. Is this a movie you think you would enjoy? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in a crowded train station and I really had to use the bathroom (#2). I hated to do it but I had no choice. I went in the gross bathroom and began my business. As usual, I decided to pass the time in the bathroom by playing games on my mobile device. That's when I let my guard down. Then some guy kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said to give him my email and he will give me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I gave him my email address. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list. Then he sent EVERYONE on the list the pic of me on the toilet, including my wife and children, my friends and coworkers and my boss. There was also a fake audio clip of gross sound! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently took a flight to the annual Jar Jar Binks convention in West Horton, Ohio. I did not want to pack my Jar Jar costume as it is extremely expensive, but it wouldn't fit in a carry on, so I had to wear it. First, the search at the airport was a human rights violation. The airport security was very rude, and made me give up the two blasters I had on, then got mad at me because of my elaborate costume, saying it took so long to search it held up the line. Then when I finally got on the plane, the stewardess said I couldn't wear my Jar Jar mask, and the two people sitting next to me (I was in the middle), grumbled because my costume took up too much space and had stuff sticking out. After takeoff, I got in the aisle, put on my mask, and danced and yelled to entertain the other travelers. The stewardess tried to stop me but I ran screaming down the aisle, and then dove into a bunch of peoples laps. I was restrained for the rest of the flight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Playing music over the mic is simply a good idea. If you have your own band, this is a great way to get exposure. When u r just starting out, it's hard to get people to hear ur stuff, but the other players will listen. If they criticize your work, ask them to be constructive and then take it to heart. If they tell you to stop, just tell them to shut it because the other players r enjoying it. Even if you don't have ur own band, play music that you enjoy. It will energize the team and let them know more about u as a person. All this adds up to better teammates and maybe, fans and friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My son decided to change his name which really bothered me. His given name was Karl. He said it was to help his career, he is an aspiring rapper. He changed it legally to Cash Money God, which I agree isn't a great name. I don't really understand it, we are well off but still. I am also an aspiring rapper and I changed my legal name a year prior to Superking, but that's a little more awesome and badass.  </TEXT>

Luckily she knew what she was doing and was able to avoid being injured during the ritual. I didn't check on her or go downstairs because she told me not to, as I could be injured by spectral energy if I interrupted the seance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, spreading those rumors about my priest burned a lot of bridges for me. A different problem I had with my neighbor and the police didn't help my reputation around town either, so my options are somewhat limited. I think a Wiccan is my best bet, my town is kind of small too so I would have to go into the city probably to find one. I think there is a Wiccan bookstore by the train station. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I don't know if they would refuse but they would not be happy. When I first moved here I was was intrigued by a beautiful policewoman. Although I wouldn't be unfaithful to my wife, I wanted to get to know her better so I kept calling in crimes so she would come by, often I would insert my neighbor into the crimes as well. Like I would call and say my neighbor was dumping an old refrigerator in the woods or that was brandishing a firearm. Anyway the police got totally grumpy and made me pay all these fines and said any more and I would get in even bigger trouble. I would prefer to keep them out of it until I have more concrete evidence. </TEXT>

Then some guy kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said to give him my email and he will give me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I gave him my email address. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list. Then he sent EVERYONE on the list the pic of me on the toilet, including my wife and children, my friends and coworkers and my boss. There was also a fake audio clip of gross sound! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue with my priest is that I had been telling parishioners that he had gotten in trouble for going to an Asian massage parlor, receiving an inappropriate sexual type of massage, and then running out without paying. In fairness, my priest has a very common name so when I looked up his name on Bing and found the police log of the above activities, you can understand how I got confused.
I'll try and find a Wiccan who can help and report back.

I think we have confirmed by this point that the man is supernatural, but we don't know if he is a ghost or something worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently moved into an old house with my family. When I first moved in I met a man who lived in the neighborhood. I came back from work early and saw this man running through my backyard. I asked my wife and she was all disheveled, she said she saw him too. She then told me that this man had died recently and must be haunting our new home! I have seen him several more times, once in my bedroom while my wife was sleeping and for a few days he was in the basement. My wife told me to stay upstairs so she could hold a seance to get rid of him, but came back in a few hours looking exhausted, saying it didn't work. I also once saw him in the grocery store at the checkout! Are there any ghost experts out there who can help me, I want to move but my wife refuses too. She says I should just ignore the ghost! Is there any way to get rid of a spectral being!?!? Please help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so tired of people complaining about Peruvians ruining online games. First off, yes they have bad internet and computers. So what? If they lose the connection just pause it. If they feed or spam, take the opportunity to try and help him mature. These people live in poverty, they need our help, not our disdain. I had a Peruvian on my team, and he died 5 times in the first 10 minutes. Did I freak out? No, I talked to him. I trained with him. I wired him money to help with his bills and family. A friendship formed. Now he is he is great player. I was invited to his village for his birthday, which was a great time. I ended up being intimate with a beautiful Peruvian woman. Be helpful, it pays off. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why foreigners playing online games on our servers is a good thing </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why using foreign servers is a good thing. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

Some people get bent out of shape when players from other countries play on their home servers. This is foolish. I play on servers all over the world. It helps me experience another culture and meet new friends. Some guidelines to help you do the same are:

1.Pause early and pause often. Each pause is an opportunity for discussion and culture.

2.Use google translate. If you don't speak the language, pause every time someone chats and input it into google translate so you understand

3.Stand still. If your ping is too high to play effectively, stay out of the game and focus on convo

4.Get to know the other players. Insist on discussion, if they don't answer consider grabbing their attention with pings.

5.Punish unwelcoming cultures. If ur teammates don't participate, send an message that gamers is a welcoming community by Intentionally ruining the game.

Remember, playing games can be a wonderful and cultural experience if you invest the time and energy to do it right! Thanks and good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a professional Dota scout checking me out and my chances were ruined by other players in a ranked match. My persona involves that I ask questions either over chat or in the mic and I need the other players to respond with a"yeah yeah". For example, I'll be like "am I original?" They say "yeah yeah". "Am i sexual?" "Yeah yeah". The questions come from the song backstreets back. Anyway the other players would not say "yeah yeah" no matter how much I asked or explained. The scout said without that showmanship I can't go pro. How could fellow gamers refuse to cooperate like that, when it was so important to me. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My wife is constantly calling me a loser just because I like gaming, particularly dota and the character Silencer, and am having trouble getting a job. She thinks she is so great because she is a lawyer and makes a lot of money. I like to wear a Silencer costume and go around town. I go into stores and dance around, knocking merchandise on the floor. I dance in front of cars so they can't move and the drivers get mad. I knock on houses and when they answer I scream in their faces and try to push my way in to smash their things. I like to entertain people and spread Dota awareness. I believe that is more important then making money. She yells at me all the time. I asked if we could include the Silencer costume in our lovemaking and she flipped out. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why I feed the courier, an open and honest discussion </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-23 01:33:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why people feed the courier. This is the second installment. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

I occasionally feed the courier. I am not proud of it, but I admit it. I do it primarily because it makes me feel good. For a brief moment, it feels like I control my teammates and they view me as a god. I'm not trying to ruin the game or anything like that. I also think people overreact to a courier feed. 1 courier feed hardly decides a game, and I think weaker players use it as en excuse for their own poor playing. Those are just my opinions, and I welcome yours. Thank you. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why can't Dota players be happy for others success? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-22 20:49:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I enjoy playing Dota but I've taken issue with how few players are genuinely happy when others do well. When another player, my team or the enemy, makes a great play, I congratulate him, even if I died! Likewise, if another player has success in life, I congratulate him. I'm not interested in trying to tear them down. Yet when I play, I hardly ever get congratulated. Whether I made a great play or reveal my great new job(6 figures), all i get is shade. It's gotten to the point that I don't even want to tell other players about myself, my car (new black benz, fully loaded), or the girls I get. When will the average player learn to not be jealous but instead to be happy for others? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so tired of people complaining about Peruvians ruining the game. First off, yes they have bad internet and computers. So what? If they lose the connection just pause it. If they feed or spam, take the opportunity to try and help him mature. These people live in poverty, they need our help, not our disdain. I had a Peruvian on my team, and he died 5 times in the first 10 minutes. Did I freak out? No, I talked to him. I trained with him. I wired him money to help with his bills and family. A friendship formed. Now he is 6k MMR. I was invited to his village for his birthday, which was a great time. I ended up being intimate with a beautiful Peruvian woman. Be helpful, it pays off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why I and others throw matches. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.
I occasionally throw matches. I admit it and I'm not proud of it. However, I have my reasons. You see by skill I'm a 5k mmr player, but I like to play at the lower brackets. So for me to maximize my fun and not advance to the higher brackets, I have to purposefully lose some time. So usually I'll play a game for real and have a great time crushing scrubs, and I'll play a second game, and have a great time doing something silly, like fight for mid with someone else, feed the courier, carry kotl who pulls players back to base. Every game I play is fun. This is valves fault for not letting me choose my bracket. Since no one has reports anymore, there is no downside. So if this happens to you remember, don't hate the player, hate the game. Tell valve to let players choose their bracket. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I very much enjoy playing dota 2 but I have an issue I was hoping somebody else may have worked out. I'm a very religious man and adhere strictly to the church's guidelines. However I am also a very skilled dota player, and through normal play, I often go on "godlike" streaks. This is of course blasphemy and not acceptable. I asked my priest and he said it was ok as long as when I get a godlike steak I say "praise Christ" over mic or chat. This makes the godlike comment about HIM and not me. However he also said at least 3 of the other 9 players must also say "praise Christ" for it to work. If they don't, I must immediately feed the courier. As you can imagine, most other players won't cooperate and flip out when I feed the courier. It's making it very difficult to play a full match and I'm getting a lot of reports. Had anyone else figured out a solution to a problem like mine? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was approached by the individual HapJak over Reddit who told me he was a pro scout and I should invite him over steam to watch me play a ranked match. I agreed. He told me he wanted to assess my leadership abilities by seeing if I could convince the other players to participate in my online persona. I was to say or chat "Am I original?" and all the other players had to say or chat "yeah yeah". Then I had to continue with all the lyrics to the chorus of the song backstreets back, e.g. "Am i sexual?" "Yeah yeah". The other players refused to cooperate and the situation deteriorated. Ending with me feeding the courier and my team losing, and me getting reported. I later found it through Reddit that he ISNT EVEN A PRO SCOUT. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why playing on other country's servers is the smart move, an open and honest discussion </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why using foreign servers is a good thing. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

Some people get bent out of shape when players from other countries play on their home servers. This is foolish. I play on servers all over the world. It helps me experience another culture and meet new friends. Some guidelines to help you do the same are:

1.Pause early and pause often. Each pause is an opportunity for discussion and culture.

2.Use google translate. If you don't speak the language, pause every time someone chats and input it into google translate so you understand

3.Stay in the jungle. If your ping is too high to play effectively, stay in the jungle for easy xp.

4.Get to know the other players. Insist on discussion, if they don't answer consider grabbing their attention with pings.

5.Punish unwelcoming cultures. If ur teammates don't participate, send an message that Dota is a welcoming community by feeding the courier or gems to the other team.

Remember, playing dota can be a wonderful and cultural experience if you invest the time and energy to do it right! Thanks and good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about whether you should play music over the mic in ranked. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

Playing music over the mic is simply a good idea. If you have your own band, this is a great way to get exposure. When u r just starting out, it's hard to get people to hear ur stuff, but the other players in ranked will listen. If they criticize your work, ask them to be constructive and then take it to heart. If they tell you to stop, just tell them to shut it because the other players r enjoying it. Even if you don't have ur own band, play music that you enjoy. It will energize the team and let them know more about u as a person. All this adds up to better teammates and maybe, fans and friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so tired of people complaining about Peruvians ruining the game. First off, yes they have bad internet and computers. So what? If they lose the connection just pause it. If they feed or spam, take the opportunity to try and help him mature. These people live in poverty, they need our help, not our disdain. I had a Peruvian on my team, and he died 5 times in the first 10 minutes. Did I freak out? No, I talked to him. I trained with him. I wired him money to help with his bills and family. A friendship formed. Now he is 6k MMR. I was invited to his village for his birthday, which was a great time. I ended up being intimate with a beautiful Peruvian woman. Be helpful, it pays off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to wear a elaborate Silencer costume as part of my every day life. I went to the grocery store and saw how depressed everyone was, so I thought I would help. I started dancing in the aisles and yelling at people and running up to people and taking things out of their cart. It was great fun. Then when I went to check out, there was only one lane open and there was a long line. I screamed and screamed while in line and danced, bumping into other people. I opened a box of baking soda and threw it around. Finally, I got to the checkout. I started making noises at the cashier and I kept pressing buttons on the computer. Some people in line were groaning because the line was getting very long, but that gave me even more incentive to make them laugh. I climbed onto the table and started kicking peoples groceries on the floor and screaming. The manager and one of his goons pulled me off and said I could never shop there again. Can I sue for harassement or possibly assault? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why peope are toxic. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

Full disclosure, i sometimes behave toxic in ranked. If a player in my team dies, I spam ping him, say gg over and over, tell others to report him, and then go into his lane to get his xp. I may also feed a courier to punish him for dying.

You may think this behavior is bad but it is actually a good thing. I make the person who died feel like garbage, and make myself feel like a king. He is motivated to not die again, and the other players see me not as a teammate, but an iconoclast to be worshipped. This makes us play better and become more cohesive as a team. In the end, we have a much better chance of winning because of me. </TEXT>

I asked my wife and she was all disheveled, she said she saw him too. She then told me that this man had died recently and must be haunting our new home! I have seen him several more times, once in my bedroom while my wife was sleeping and for a few days he was in the basement. My wife told me to stay upstairs so she could hold a seance to get rid of him, but came back in a few hours looking exhausted, saying it didn't work. I also once saw him in the grocery store at the checkout! Are there any ghost experts out there who can help me, I want to move but my wife refuses too. She says I should just ignore the ghost! Is there any way to get rid of a spectral being!?!? Please help. </TEXT>

She thinks she is so great because she is a lawyer and makes a lot of money. I like to wear a Silencer costume and go around town. I go into stores and dance around, knocking merchandise on the floor. I dance in front of cars so they can't move and the drivers get mad. I knock on houses and when they answer I scream in their faces and try to push my way in to smash their things. I like to entertain people and spread Dota awareness. I believe that is more important then making money. She yells at me all the time. I asked if we could include the Silencer costume in our lovemaking and she flipped out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why the current reporting system works very well. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

First off, full disclosure. I occasionally feed the courier. I am not proud of it, but I admit it. I do it primarily because it makes me feel good. For a brief moment, it feels like I control my teammates and they view me as a god. I'm not trying to ruin the game or anything like that. Many of you would like to be able to report me and get me banned. Luckily, the report system won't let you, and this is a good thing. You see I bring a meta game to the table. But not knowing if I will feed the courier, my teammates have a more exciting game. In your anger, you try to report me but I'm never stopped. You see ur monthly report is not enough to do anything, and the chance that everyone will have a report available for me is non existent. In effect, there is no way to stop me, and that's great news. So sit back and enjoy a more exciting and more rewarding gaming experience!

Those are just my opinions, and I welcome yours. Thank you.

<TITLE> Why I feed the courier: an open and honest discussion. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-11 17:22:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why people feed the courier. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

I occasionally feed the courier. I am not proud of it, but I admit it. I do it primarily because it makes me feel good. For a brief moment, it feels like I control my teammates and they view me as a god. I'm not trying to ruin the game or anything like that. I also think people overreact to a courier feed. 1 courier feed hardly decides a game, and I think weaker players use it as en excuse for their own poor playing. Those are just my opinions, and I welcome yours. Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a huge dota fan and apparently that has made me not worthy of protection from my local police. There is this policewoman who i like so recently i kept calling in crimes so i could see her. I called in a Meepo invasion, an invoker meteor crash, and a pudge attack. The police have become totally grumpy and say if i make one more fake call they will arrest me! Anyway, my neighbor put on a Juggernaut mask and came into my house and beat me and robbed me! He said he was gonna come back tomorrow for more stuff and more beatings!!! If I call the cops and say Juggernaut is beating me up, they will arrest me, and if I don't, my neighbor will beat me and take more of my stuff!!! What can I do? I have nowhere to turn!!! Please help me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I too had a similar experience with a different company during air travel so I know how horrific it can be. I recently took a flight to the annual Jar Jar Binks convention in West Horton, Ohio. I did not want to pack my Jar Jar costume as it is extremely expensive, but it wouldn't fit in a carry on, so I had to wear it. First, the search at the airport was a human rights violation. The airport security was very rude, and made me give up the two blasters I had on, then got mad at me because of my elaborate costume, saying it took so long to search it held up the line. Then when I finally got on the plane, the stewardess said I couldn't wear my Jar Jar mask, and the two people sitting next to me (I was in the middle), grumbled because my costume took up too much space and had stuff sticking out. After takeoff, I got in the aisle, put on my mask, and danced and yelled to entertain the other travelers. The stewardess tried to stop me but I ran screaming down the aisle, and then dove into a bunch of peoples laps. I was restrained for the rest of the flight. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Everyone complains about Peruvians and others, but what have you done to help? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm so tired of people complaining about Peruvians ruining the game. First off, yes they have bad internet and computers. So what? If they lose the connection just pause it. If they feed or spam, take the opportunity to try and help him mature. These people live in poverty, they need our help, not our disdain. I had a Peruvian named HapJak on my team, and he died 5 times in the first 10 minutes. Did I freak out? No, I talked to him. I trained with him. I wired him money to help with his bills and family. A friendship formed. Now he is 6k MMR. I was invited to his village for his birthday, which was a great time. I ended up being intimate with a beautiful Peruvian woman. Be helpful, it pays off. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> HapJak invited me to a mid level dota tourney so I agreed and we met at a train station. Unfortunately, I really had to use the bathroom (#2). I hated to do it but I had no choice. I went in the gross bathroom and began my business. Then HapJak kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said he will email me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I agreed. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list. Then he sent EVERYONE on the list the pic of me on the toilet, including my wife and children, my friends and coworkers and my boss. There was also a fake audio clip of gross sound! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently enlisted the services of HapJak's MMR and LP Service to both get me out of low priority (I fed the courier a few times) and raise my MMR 1000 points. He said it would take 5 days and cost $175. I told him I didn't trust him and I would only pay after he was done. He agreed, but said he needed a copy of my drivers license first. I took a quick scan and sent it over. The next day he didn't even start playing my account. Then the second day came and went. The third day I get a phone call from West Youngton police, saying a left my license at a message parlor. I told them I don't live anywhere near there and I had my license on me. Turns out HapJak had used my license scan to make a fake ID and then sold it. The guy who bought it went to an Asian massage parlor and requested a handjob, and then ran out without paying, dropping the license during his escape. Protect your personal information people! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was approached by the individual HapJak over Reddit who told me he was a pro scout and I should invite him over steam to watch me play a ranked match. I agreed. He told me he wanted to assess my leadership abilities by seeing if I could convince the other players to participate in my online persona. I was to say or chat "Am I original?" and all the other players had to say or chat "yeah yeah". Then I had to continue with all the lyrics to the chorus of the song backstreets back, e.g. "Am i sexual?" "Yeah yeah". The other players refused to cooperate and the situation deteriorated. Ending with me feeding the courier and my team losing, and me getting reported. I later found it through Reddit that he ISNT EVEN A PRO SCOUT. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a professional scout checking me out and my chances were ruined by other players in ranked. My persona involves that I ask questions either over chat or in the mic and I need the other players to respond with a"yeah yeah". For example, I'll be like "am I original?" They say "yeah yeah". "Am i sexual?" "Yeah yeah". The questions come from the song backstreets back. Anyway the other players would not say "yeah yeah" no matter how much I asked or explained. The scout said without that showmanship I can't go pro. How do I deal with people who flat out refuse to cooperate? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I very much enjoy playing dota 2 but I have an issue I was hoping somebody else may have worked out. I'm a very religious man and adhere strictly to the church's guidelines. However I am also a very skilled dota player, and through normal play, I often go on "godlike" streaks. This is of course blasphemy and not acceptable. I asked my priest and he said it was ok as long as when I get a godlike steak I say "praise Christ" over mic or chat. This makes the godlike comment about HIM and not me. However he also said at least 3 of the other 9 players must also say "praise Christ" for it to work. If they don't, I must immediately feed the courier. As you can imagine, most other players won't cooperate and flip out when I feed the courier. It's making it very difficult to play a full match and I'm getting a lot of reports. Had anyone else figured out a solution to a problem like mine? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in a somewhat hostile workplace. It's an office setting but I think it is unusual in the large number of bad people who work there. One morning I woke up and decided I wasn't going to take it anymore, so I set out to make things right. The first bully was Walter. He bullied everyone by hanging out in the mens bathroom all day and making horrid noises and odors. Every time I tried to use the bathroom he was in there. He told me once that he had an irritable bowel, but I know he thinks it's so funny to make people hear and smell gross things. Sure enough he was in a stall when I came in. I figured, if he wants to be in the stall, he should have some reading material. I banged on the stall door and he asked what was the problem, so i said "i got the newspaper for you, hot off the presses!", then I lit the newspaper on fire and threw it over the stall door and ran out. Next time he wants to hang out in the stall all day, he'll surely remember this incident. The next bully was Greg. Greg was the work gym bully. He is 60-70 years old but insists on standing around naked in the mens locker room, forcing everyone to see him nude. It's a real passive aggressive bullying behavior. Outside the gym was a pile of pulled weeds that some gardeners were working on. I took a large handful of weeds and dirt on my way into the gym. I went into the locker room and he was just getting out of the shower. I yelled "hey Greg, welcome to the garden of Eden!" And jammed the handful of weeds in his face! He started yelling and lashing out at me so I ran out, bullies can turn to violence to abuse others and I didn't want to risk injury. There were more bullies I stood up to, but I don't want to make a wall of text. Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in a crowded train station and I really had to use the bathroom (#2). I hated to do it but I had no choice. I went in the gross bathroom and began my business. Then some guy kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said to give him my email and he will give me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I gave him my email address. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list. Then he sent EVERYONE on the list the pic of me on the toilet, including my wife and children, my friends and coworkers and my boss. There was also a fake audio clip of gross sound! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sandlot, because of the bullying scenes. It made me scared of bullies until I was 40, but then I stood up to them.

I work in a somewhat hostile workplace. It's an office setting but I think it is unusual in the large number of bad people who work there. One morning I woke up and decided I wasn't going to take it anymore, so I set out to make things right. The first bully was Walter. He bullied everyone by hanging out in the mens bathroom all day and making horrid noises and odors. Every time I tried to use the bathroom he was in there. He told me once that he had an irritable bowel, but I know he thinks it's so funny to make people hear and smell gross things. Sure enough he was in a stall when I came in. I figured, if he wants to be in the stall, he should have some reading material. I banged on the stall door and he asked what was the problem, so i said "i got the newspaper for you, hot off the presses!", then I lit the newspaper on fire and threw it over the stall door and ran out. Next time he wants to hang out in the stall all day, he'll surely remember this incident. The next bully was Greg. Greg was the work gym bully. He is 60-70 years old but insists on standing around naked in the mens locker room, forcing everyone to see him nude. It's a real passive aggressive bullying behavior. Outside the gym was a pile of pulled weeds that some gardeners were working on. I took a large handful of weeds and dirt on my way into the gym. I went into the locker room and he was just getting out of the shower. I yelled "hey Greg, welcome to the garden of Eden!" And jammed the handful of weeds in his face! He started yelling and lashing out at me so I ran out, bullies can turn to violence to abuse others and I didn't want to risk injury. There were more bullies I stood up to, but I don't want to make a wall of text. Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I very much enjoy playing dota 2 but I have an issue I was hoping somebody else may have worked out. I'm a very religious man and adhere strictly to the church's guidelines. However I am also a very skilled dota player, and through normal play, I often go on "godlike" streaks. This is of course blasphemy and not acceptable. I asked my priest and he said it was ok as long as when I get a godlike steak I say "praise Christ" over mic or chat. This makes the godlike comment about HIM and not me. However he also said at least 3 of the other 9 players must also say "praise Christ" for it to work. If they don't, I must immediately feed the courier. As you can imagine, most other players won't cooperate and flip out when I feed the courier. It's making it very difficult to play a full match and I'm getting a lot of reports. Had anyone else figured out a solution to a problem like mine? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work for the state and was put in charge of a huge sum of money that was to help Newark schools (zuckerberg gave it). Anyway I was looking at different projects and proposals when I got a strange email. The email was from a beautiful Russian woman who was looking to move to the states, but needed help. You wouldn't believe how hot she was, so I sent her $200 to help, hoping it would help me get with her when she got here. Anyway, she kept running into more and more problems, and I kept having to bail her out. After about a year, I realized I had burned through like 40 million dollars! Chris Christie was pissed and was gonna fire me but we're friends from the country club so he let it slide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guy, your music is wonderous, can you use that insight to solve this ancient riddle?
"Solomon the powerful and wealthy king chooses to test his most loyal and trusted minister, Benaiah Ben Yehoyada, by asking of him an impossible task. The king asks Benaiah to find for him a ring, knowing full well that the ring does not exist, which has magic powers. If a happy man looks at it, he becomes sad, and if a sad man looks at it, he becomes happy, he tells him. He expresses his desire to wear the ring for Sukkot, which is six months away. After months of searching, Benaiah finds himself, the night before Sukkot, walking through the poorest neighborhood of Jerusalem. He happens upon a jeweler, who, when asked if hes heard of such a ring, produces from his pocket a plain gold ring, to which he adds an engravement. Benaiah reads the inscription and smiles. He returns just in time on the eve of Sukkot to give the king the ring he has requested. The king laughs and takes the ring, but upon reading the inscription, becomes very sad. What was engraved on the ring?" The Answer is: The ring was engraved with "This ring is good for one blowjob from King Solomon." </TEXT>

I recently took a flight to the annual Jar Jar Binks convention in West Horton, Ohio. I did not want to pack my Jar Jar costume as it is extremely expensive, but it wouldn't fit in a carry on, so I had to wear it. First, the search at the airport was a human rights violation. The airport security was very rude, and made me give up the two blasters I had on, then got mad at me because of my elaborate costume, saying it took so long to search it held up the line. Then when I finally got on the plane, the stewardess said I couldn't wear my Jar Jar mask, and the two people sitting next to me (I was in the middle), grumbled because my costume took up too much space and had stuff sticking out. After takeoff, I got in the aisle, put on my mask, and danced and yelled to entertain the other travelers. The stewardess tried to stop me but I ran screaming down the aisle, and then dove into a bunch of peoples laps. I was restrained for the rest of the flight. </TEXT>

Then some guy kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said to give him my email and he will give me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I gave him my email address. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list. Then he sent EVERYONE on the list the pic of me on the toilet, including my wife and children, my friends and coworkers and my boss. There was also a fake audio clip of gross sound! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can code a program that will help me with my workplace bullies? I work in a somewhat hostile workplace. It's an office setting but I think it is unusual in the large number of bad people who work there. One morning I woke up and decided I wasn't going to take it anymore, so I set out to make things right. The first bully was Walter. He bullied everyone by hanging out in the mens bathroom all day and making horrid noises and odors. Every time I tried to use the bathroom he was in there. He told me once that he had an irritable bowel, but I know he thinks it's so funny to make people hear and smell gross things. Sure enough he was in a stall when I came in. I figured, if he wants to be in the stall, he should have some reading material. I banged on the stall door and he asked what was the problem, so i said "i got the newspaper for you, hot off the presses!", then I lit the newspaper on fire and threw it over the stall door and ran out. Next time he wants to hang out in the stall all day, he'll surely remember this incident. The next bully was Greg. Greg was the work gym bully. He is 60-70 years old but insists on standing around naked in the mens locker room, forcing everyone to see him nude. It's a real passive aggressive bullying behavior. Outside the gym was a pile of pulled weeds that some gardeners were working on. I took a large handful of weeds and dirt on my way into the gym. I went into the locker room and he was just getting out of the shower. I yelled "hey Greg, welcome to the garden of Eden!" And jammed the handful of weeds in his face! He started yelling and lashing out at me so I ran out, bullies can turn to violence to abuse others and I didn't want to risk injury. There were more bullies I stood up to, but I don't want to make a wall of text. Thank you. </TEXT>

All of a sudden I see some shadows moving in an alley. Three assailants rushed out at us, they were armed with semi automatic weapons. I drew my weapon and fired 4 shots in 1 second. The three assailants went down, each with a head shot. The fourth bullet hit their getaway driver, disabling him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wouldn't you agree that most of the people who are vocal about the right to bear arms are merely playing make believe, similar to a child wearing a cape? There is very little chance that a legitimate situation to be carrying a gun will arise, but they wish to carry them anyway as it makes them feel powerful like a real soldier in a war zone. Of course, they are too scared to be actual soldiers. </TEXT>

I checked ur proof pic and noticed you have very batlike features. Not unattractive, just more similar to a bat then I would expect from random chance, especially the eyes. Considering you are also a bat researcher, it seems like to much of a coincidence. Care to reveal any genetic testing/alternations/hybridization that you may have underwent? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi PF, I'm interested in buying a upper floor condo in a very hip downtown area in northern NJ. It's in high end area popular with young go getters, and has lots of nice amenities. The cost is $800,000. I'm 26 and make about $200,000 a year base salary, plus up to 20% bonus. I am also given a car and most meals, so I can save a lot of my income. I also have a brokerage worth about $100,000, which generates another $5000 per year. I have about $100000 in cash for a down payment. The area seems like it will only continue to improve. Does this sound like a good investment? </TEXT>

The two embraced, and the foundation of the building rocked with their passion. A crate fell to the ground near their feet. An order form fell out, it revealed that they had sold enough FX Crates.
