<TEXT> Actually, she did not do anything, as demonstrated by an extensive investigation

No, what the investigation found was there was no intent.

She did do something. Just not anything that was strong enough for a criminal case.

Let us not pretend Clinton fucked up using a private server because she did. I voted for her, i was happy to do so and excited to see her be president but she fucked up there in that regard.

Downplaying the severity of something just because no charges were filed diminishing the severity of the actions taken in this ordeal and that shouldn't happen.

<TEXT> Why would a left-leaning independent media outlet such as ProPublica deflect from the Trump Russia scandal?

Why would the people/the media not also provide oversight into intelligence agencies if they operated not truthfully or wholly accurately compared to their public statements on their actions?

Why can't we talk about both? 

To paraphrase Crooked Media's Lovett or Leave It, why don't liberal people understand that this was a serious investigation into misconduct into the Secretary of State's office's handling of information? James Comey basically tried to explain that it was a serious and legitmate investigation to Sen Feinstein during his hearing last week. Why is that anything that doesn't talk about Trump/Russia on days that there is big news about that get dealt with the same seriousness or at least tone as other news pieces, especially ones from a site like ProPublica? 

That's just ignornance on your behalf for not knowing ProPublica and that is fine but your comment , the tone of it and the idea that others will see this article and think of it as nothing more than deflection rather than reporting is annoying.

The FBI was investigating a legitimate fuck up by Hillary Clinton and her staff, Huma Abedin included.  You or I or anybody else shouldn't write off independent reporting from places like ProPublica into the conduct and actions of the FBI and Director Comey just because it was published on a big news day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So let met get this straight.

Are you claiming that an independent news organization, albeit somewhat left leaning, is chosing to research and report on something that probably the more mainstream NYT/WashingtonPosts of the MSM-sphere are reporting on as to "change the subject?"

I find that to be extremely fucking stupid thing to want an independent outlet like ProPublica to do. Reporting on things that don't get a lot of coverage elsewhere is exactly what ProPublica does best and should do.

Just because they report on something that isn't Russia or today's hearing doesn't mean they are trying to change the subject. Spoiler alert but there are a number of angles and valid criticism of both sides, the investigators and the investigated.

The fact that you said "Don't change the subject" to a ProPublica article is down right insulting and laughable.

We are fully capable of criticizing and investigating Donald Trump as we are the actions of the FBI and James Comey and their operating as well. 

I know that we are capable because we are humans but also because the Senate is doing the same thing. They are investigation Trump and providing Oversight to the FBI.

The people are and should be doing the same thing. The Washington Post and NYT and NBC News and CNN and other outlets big and small are investigation Donald Trump and his  ties to Russia. And the people should continue to critique and oversee the actions of the FBI and it's director much like any organization. 

These people and outlets should also not care too much about when they publish their articles if they do so in the future on a day when some other big news because they should just ignore people who claim they are trying to change the subject by talking about something else of importance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well let's think it out. I think the is a case to be made for yes and no but we need to establish some things and get questions answered.

Treason is defined has giving aid to our enemies. It's in the Constitution and that definition is the only one that matters.

Was Flynn giving aid to our enemies? That is a question we need answers to.

Firstly we should decide who out enemies are and is Russia one of them?

Also would it matter that legally Mike Flynn was not a legal registered agent of a foreign governments? 

I can't say if Flynn committed treason in the legal sense. But I believe that Flynn committed moral treason acting against that which or country was founded on, what he did might not have been treason in the legal sense buy he certainly betrayed his country and his fellow citizens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes and no.

I think that if Mike Pence isn't a moderate neither is John Kasich.

But John Kasich is a man of his views, he is not moderate in his opinions. The difference this election was that he was moderate in his way of speaking, his tone, demeanour, his public persona. He was and is easily digestible on public. Making him seem like the moderate compared to the bombast of Trump or the ideologue of Cruz.

What would make Kasich better than either of them is he's pragmatic. He will take what he can get. My problem is that what he wants is not moderate 
and given a competent republican Congress would give him a lot I disagree with strongly.

So perhaps Kasich is a moderate lawmaker but he's not a moderate in opinion. Perhaps his private view is far far less moderate than good public view or accomplishments but he takes what he can gets.

From the Rolling Stone:

Despite his carefully cultivated appearance, and despite comparisons to the moron and the goblin left standing next to him, John Kasich is no moderate. A cursory look at his record proves the opposite: On the issues that matter, Kasich is a deep-red conservative who would do everything in his power to move America in an uglier, more regressive direction.

Let's look at just one issue: the right of women in Ohio to get an abortion when they need one. As governor, Kasich has done everything in his power to put roadblock after roadblock in their way.

Kasich has worked with the legislature to jam some of the nation's most restrictive anti-abortion policies into the state's budget (a neat trick that makes them easier to pass).

In 2013, the budget defunded Planned Parenthood, eliminating $1.4 million in federal funds that went toward a wide variety of health care services  and not a penny toward abortion, since federal dollars can't pay for abortion anyway.

That same budget funded so-called "crisis pregnancy centers," fake health clinics that offer free pregnancy tests and sometimes ultrasounds to draw women in the door, where counselors ply them with false information claiming abortion causes everything from breast cancer to cooties.

Thanks to Kasich, women in Ohio who need an abortion must undergo an ultrasound  and a doctor must describe the fetus to them  a condescending, harassing provision that implies women don't understand what being pregnant actually is, and that once they find out, they won't want an abortion anymore. (Turns out they pretty much all still do.)

Perhaps ugliest of all, Kasich's 2013 budget banned rape crisis counselors from referring victims of sexual assault to abortion services. Tell a woman who's been raped how to end a pregnancy, and you lose your funding from the state.

John Kasich thinks women who are raped shouldn't be told where they can get an abortion, and he used the power of his governorship to stop it.

The 2015 budget included further restrictions to abortion clinics, meaningless requirements masquerading as "protecting women's health" with the actual purpose of shutting clinics down. And shut down they have: About half of Ohio's abortion providers have shuttered since Kasich took office, and that number could easily rise.

That's the real John Kasich. Not the friendly dad on the debate stage shaking his head at all the bickering. Not the guy who attended a same-sex wedding  the one who went, and still opposes same-sex marriage. Not the one who sounds reasonable and kindthe one who would keep a rape victim from learning where she can end her pregnancy.

For Frontlines, especially on Fort De Veaux it can turn the tide of a stalemate. Probably most useful for the 2 objectives that are outside, the ones before each team's telegraphs.

If the enemy keeps capturing that objective and attacking your telegraphs use smoke to push up when it's time to capture that objective.

<TEXT> Yes, I am against it. Not only is it not enough money it's a lazy half-assed way of fixing a problem. 


Why go half-assed, halfway with pre-exisiting conditions. Just make it fucking illegal to discriminate against it. Don't bullshit it halfway.

It might pass the house but i will not pass the Senate unless Pre-exisiting conditions are covered wholly and fully as they are in Obamacare. 

Seriously? These guys think that $1.6 billion per year actually makes a difference?

Anyway, who knows what's going to happen now. The basic problem is still the same, namely that this is a very dangerous vote for folks in swing districts. That might be worth it for a higher cause, but not for a bill that can't come close to passing in the Senate.

Plus there's the fact that 24 million people would lose coverage if the bill passes. I suppose that might be a factor for a few Republicans. Maybe.

<TEXT> It's not that hard to say she's much better. Even with amendments and changes it got through. They still got the major piece of legislation through and kept most Democratic reps in line to vote for it.

Everything i've read and heard about Pelosi outside of Reddit, says she was a fantastic House leader that whipped votes and got things done.

Paul Ryan for both issues of himself and of the House Republican party, cannot accomplish the single biggest legislative agenda they have claimed to have for 8 years.

But a good leader as you say gets people on the same page for major legislation. They make compromise, they promise something down the road. 

Paul Ryan can't do that because of the ideaology fracture in the House GOP party but it seems like he isn't trying. He can only placate to the Freedom Caucus or the Tuesday Group because they are so large and because of the intra-partisan divide so different.

That is a whole another problem for the House GOP party. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well then Paul Ryan needs to realize that not only is he bad a whipping votes for something the party as whole promised to do but also that they need to pick their battles and/or accept their losses.

Republicans aren't going to get a win repealing or doing anything that restricts Obamacare. Yes there are fixes that need to be done but it's clear that those fixes are not going to be accomplished by letting the market decide or other conservative ideas.

There are plenty of ways "small government" or the Conservative way of thinking of politics could help or at least not be as unpopular. He or they need to accept that Healthcare is not one of the issues they can win on or get something helpful done.

It's obviously a multi-faceted issue with a number of problems from both the party's spin, Ryan's incompetence and so on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What? What sorta of distorted view do you have that this is the take away you get?

I didn't hear any news of deaths following the strike so I asked if that is true, for i don't know, proof or a source or news report to show that "oh people did die."

And you can't even confirm whether or not people actually died and whether your comment is legitmately truthful? How fucking shameful.

There is plenty to shit on Donald Trump about and you better be god damn right and not just be making up details about things because that is a poor way to do it.

And a minor detail of a missile strike intended to damage an airbase is the deaths of people in surrounding areas? How the fuck are unintended deaths a minor damn detail?

That is not a minor detail and that is not something that should be questioned. It's literally life and death, it's supposedly a simple fact you should know and be able to answer very simple with the words.

"Yes people did die."

You think i'm trying to distract from the main issue? That's absurd, i wanted to clarify what happened because i wasn't sure.

In fact it helps your comment and makes Wilbur Ross's comment more outrageous if you can literally know for a fact people died. But you seem to fucking lazy or intellectually dishonest to bother to do that or clarify and innocent query.

Fucking shameful. I'm embarrassed for you. </TEXT>

No that is not basically all the Chief Justice does.

You should just read the wikipedia page. The Chief justice does more behind the scenes of the court itself as well as other duties. There are some interesting tidbits.

One of the more topical today being the appointment of federal judges to the FISA court and the overseeing of the impeachment trial of POTUS.

I heard that it's because of the destructability that the gas goes through things. Something to do with the game engine you can't have the destructablity and the gas not go everywhere.

But you could also just think that no walls are air sealed perfectly so gas would get through eventually.

I can't say anything about Deer Park but it will be cheaper if you go go where the town owns the parking and not a private company.

And you are wondering why random nobodies with nothing to lose, no boss to answer to, not sitting in the briefing room with dozens of other reporters and so and so forth.

<TEXT> I'm pretty surprised at how Tillerson has been one of the more reasonable cabinet members.

There is nothing reasonable about Tillerson actions as a cabinet member.

He's treatment and/or lack there of his press members. He's refusal to answer any questions anywhere unless at a press conference. He's refusual to stand up for American journalists when the Russian Foreign minister insulted one in Moscow.

Tillerson is not reasonable because he didn't want the job in the first place. He can't get a deputy, he let go career civil servants. 

Tillerson's actions and sometimes lack of speak a lot fucking more than some lip-service comments here and there.  </TEXT>

There is no reason for it to be completed now. Congress has just returned to session this past week, presumable the White House has been prepping the tax reform plan and working the details.

<TEXT> Considering the Turkish govt hasn't confirmed something so harmless is skeptical.

This whole thing makes no sense on the surface and as Rachel Maddow continues to say if it doesn't make sense on the first look it will make sense on some other level.

Right now, with no government statements from either I'm not inclined to believe this to be true. 

The Erdogan government has far more to gain from lying and claiming this happened then the W.H does by this actually being true.

I work at a major media company, I've seen nothing or heard nothing that makes me think this is legitimate right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats where I disagree. I think the creator does have a right to control the distribution of their content regardless of the transaction of money.

For example, a neo-nazi group takes a photo i took that wasn't intended to having meaning to a neo-nazi group. They aren't selling the shirts but they had them made up to wear to their protests.

I believe I have the right to demand they ceist and desist the creation and distribution of those shirts with my photograph. They didn't ask for permission or anything, they just took it and it's being used in a way in which i don't approve and could cost me work if i'm a pro-photog and it gets up a neo-nazi group if using my photo.

Copyrights and patents are different things and trying to discuss them in the same conversation will get difficult. I have no interest in patents here, only copyrights.

Information is not what get copyrighted.

You can't copyright the idea you have for a photograph/photoshoot or movie

You can copyright the script you wrote from the idea or the photo you took.

Copyrights are for tangible, existing things and thats how it *should* be used.

<TEXT> I agree with the overall idea but this is a sentence i take issue with.

But beyond that I want there to be no legal avenue for you to impugn me on the basis that I use something you publicly distributed and which I purchased in a way you do not like

I'm not sure if we agree or just have our wires crossed. Publicly distributing something in what way? In a what you are stating this is in the public domain or any and all use? In Creative commons where it cant be used for commercial reasons only non-commercial reasons? It ennds up getting complex.

So as an example a photo i have in a photo gallery for which i have all the rights for ends up on a t-shirt you are selling on your website. You never asked for permission or licensed the photo as you are expected.

I find out that this photo if being distributed and used on a t-shirt. I would then send cease and desist letters to stop the sale and try to work something out with you, be it monetary compensation or just the stopping of the use of the photo and money not being the problem.

It for the creator to control their property and distribute as they want. Which is public domain is a thing and copyright is a thing, they are different avenues of distributive laws you can pursue depending on your intentions with the content.

The issue is that you create something that and the laws are there to give you and your content the protection from illegal distribution or use. Such as your photo you took ending up on a t-shirt at walmart that you still hold the rights to wholly, for example.

Hence why most issues around copyright i notice are dealing with people who don't ask permission to use things in a certain way, be it big business or youtuber. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you say isn't very convincing to me. I'm in favor of protecting intellectually property. I think life of the author + 70 years is fine, it allows for the author and their family or estate to control that which the author created and how it can be used after they are gone for a period time. I work in media now and studied it in school. Can you explain somethings, perhaps to try show me I am wrong or  at least better understand your problems here.

Why is the an issue that matters to you? What exactly is wrong with this, okay you seem to think the time is too long. Why is that? What do you propose instead?

If I create something that becomes a very big thing or is marketable, makes me a lot of money or whatever else I would want the ability to control it's use and who else makes money from it during my lifetime and at least for some time after. If that's what i am leaving the world I'd like to know it won't be destroyed or used in a manner which i feel is inappropriate. </TEXT>

You're all pissy that there is a theory or a conspiracy that Trump conspired with Russia?

Are you going to ignore all the other "Russia thing(s)" about Trump and Trump people that as a public official we have the right to know if he expects to be a leader?

The only conspiracy is the Trump himself colluded with Russia or had contact there is no proof only speculation of that. But there is plenty of proof Trump officials had contact with Russia by way of Russian officials and lied about it.

Why did they lie about these contacts? Why can they just be honest about literally anything?  </TEXT>

Chechnya is probably the most well known of these republicans due to it's past history of war and violence.

While yes it's technically part of Russia just like New York is part of the United States but Chechnya did something just in Chechnya independent of all the other states, republicans and regions of Russia.

I think they specfically say Chechnya because of this reason and that people have heard of this place before just as in the past week headlines have read "New York makes public school tuition free for students" rather than "United States makes public schools tuition free for students."

<TEXT> Well Kushner lied in his TS clearence forms that's a huge deal

That was before the strike, those articles were sent out. My RSS feed got them. I saw it Reddit and facebook shared there, it was covered on at least CNN and MSNBC and i'm positive of.

 A US comressman conspired with the Whitehouse to stop a house investigation into the Whitehouse

Literally like 2 weeks of news coverage, covered the day he stepped down too, again before the strike. I know everybody covered that, shared online everywhere.

A Russian hacker was arrested in Spain today.

Yes and now what? From just the page on reddit it confuses and makes no sense to me and i'm very technologically literate i would say. 

But you sayd 0 articles popped up about the Russia prob, but is the hacker in Spain deal about the Russia probe or not about the Russia probe?

Did that not pop up on your "dashboard?"

Are your complaints more that the tv news networks haven't given ample time to that story today rather than it being on your "dashboard" even though i presume you saw it somewhere, on reddit or wherever else.

IMO with the Russian hacker in Spain, it seems to be the connections may run deep to other people and to the layman person would be rather complex for those who don't "get tech" aka older and or just technologically illiterate folks. So i think in that regard media people need to   simplify the story some way. To be like "Okay a Russian hacker was arrested in Spain. Why does Bobby in middle america need to know about this, why should he care about this, etc etc."

In that regard, it's not as simple for "mainstream" outlets i feel. </TEXT>

For example i i dont understand why you are incapable of giving an inch or even bothering to see the other side. Do you believe that youre opinions are the only correct ones on this matter or something? Since you refuse to come halfway and i'll have to waste time either trying to drag it out of you or do the work for you.

So instead of doing any work, engaging in any worthwhile discussion you are more intent on hurling insults like a child.

If you can't be bothered to try to understand why something is the way it is and would rather resort to insult and shooting down first hand experience from people who are trying to explain it you, than you are not worth anybody's time in this discussion, argument or any future ones.

<TEXT> If your entire argument hinges on not giving any time to Nunes stepping down and the fact is that there was an entire day between news stories, you're argument is weak.

You lied about the time table, something easily verifiable for you.

Nunes stepping down from the Russia investigation was given all the news it needed. 

Did he step down? Yes.

Why? Because of xyz

Who is replacing him? These guys

There is no more information, story over. Lets wait for the investigation to continue.

There are far more important things in the world going on than the guy stepping down. It's not as big a deal overrall as some redditors like to make it seem. It seems like a big deal or like the biggest news story in the world because this is an echo chamber.

It was a big story, it was given the time it deserved and everybody was caught up and moved onto the next important world event.

Everything you question was discussed when the event was in the news cycle. If you missed it, you missed, you can seek out those opinions if you wish but that is on you. Do not blame anybody but yourself for not getting yourself up to speed.

It's 2017, the information is right there. I work at a major media outlet and i cannot stand lazy people who cant be bothered to seek out information they miss and blame everybody else for it.

Nunes stepping down was given the time of day it was deserved for the impact it had overall to the grand scheme of things. 

Neither side is perfect, media or the consumers. But as reddit finds out time and time again, not everything that is treated as biggest story on earth here is the biggest story out in reality. </TEXT>

You making it seem like it wasnt a thing 

Or people making it the only thing why she lost. Considering nobody talking to you of saying it's the main reason I'm going with the later.

The fact that you seemingly cannot move an inch on this subject and that you are right and everybody is wrong, there is no middle ground is exceptionally obnoxious.

Do you know why media didn't talk so much about Clinton's look? She's spent 20 years trying not to bring authentic l attention to it, not responding to bullshit about it, dressing the way she had dressed for years.

Yet somehow you manage to essentially complain the media shit on Trump's looks, that more people publicly shit on his looks.

Do you know why? Because it's been shown that Trump shits on the way people look. He seemingly doesn't care or mind doing it to others and receiving it from others. It's basically the treating others the way you want to be treated or least bring about to take what you dish out.

It's perfectly reasonable and true that people haven't liked Clinton because she's a women, people won't outright say it but pretending that it didn't help facilitate the dislike it hatred is as nave as saying Obama's skin color didn't play a part, consciously or subconsciously.
 
What your are basically doing is telling a women who has first hand experience seeing and being on the receiving end of misogny and telling her it didn't matter. That is astoundingly tone deaf. </TEXT>

Why are you lying?

I didn't edit anything.

My comment originally said what it still says now.

This has absolutely nothing to do with being a conservative and everything to do with being out of touch and not caring about the harm one's policies will do to the citizens the President is supposed to govern.

If he doesn't fucking get it that people will suffer under these policies. Maybe he's stupid or blind to facts or just doesn't care. If he's doesn't care, if the President does not care that his policies will cause more suffering, harm and bad to people than good than he deserves to suffer.

*Here is an actual edit*

Yes, i hope something horrible befalls the President's family so then maybe he will fucking understand and have some god damn sympathy. Not because he's a republican or a conservative but because he is a poor excuse for a human being. For all the shit things he's done or said to or about people and for the policies he will inact that will hurt people, he deserves the karma for leading a horrible life.

<TEXT> You need 60 votes to end debate, aka the filibuster, and bring the nomination to the floor for a vote.

Since the Republicans currently hold 52 Senate seats, it means the GOP needs eight Democrats simply to schedule a final vote. (After the 60-vote threshold is reached, the nomination itself needs only 51 votes to pass.)


Given the degree of partisan polarization in the Capitol and in the country today, most observers expect it will be hard for Republicans to secure the backing of eight Democrats. So a procedural shortcut known as the "nuclear option" stands as an alluring alternative, since it would allow Senate Republicans to sidestep the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominations.


The nuclear or constitutional option is a parliamentary procedure that allows the U.S. Senate to override a rule or precedent by a simple majority of 51 votes, instead of by a supermajority of 60 votes. The option is invoked by the presiding officer of the United States Senate ruling that the validity of a Senate rule or precedent is a constitutional question. The issue is immediately put to the full Senate, which decides by majority vote. The procedure thus allows the Senate to decide any issue by majority vote, regardless of existing procedural rules, such as current Senate rules specifying that ending a filibuster requires the consent of 60 senators (out of 100) for legislation, and 67 for amending a Senate rule.


In 2013, Democrats, led by then-Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, finally gave in to frustration over the refusal by the chambers Republican minority to approve President Barack Obamas appointees, notably appeals-court judges. With the support of 52 Democrats, Reid succeeded in deploying the nuclear option, easing passage of several of Obamas executive-branch and judicial nominees.

Reid limited the scope of his maneuver to appointments below the level of Supreme Court justice; for the Supreme Court, traditional filibuster and cloture rules would still apply. The fact that Reid left that exception is what brought us to the current faceoff.


Going nuclear is not changing the filibuster overall. It's a shortcut to by pass it for the nomination of presidential appointees, Which Harry Reid first changed in 2013. To get rid of the filibuster and implement this "shortcut" all the way requires 67 yay votes, 2/3 Senate majority to fully change the rules of the senate.

Frankly, i don't really care. I think your comment is an overreaction that the (D)s lost, whether it's Sanders or Clinton. You feel betrayed by the people, the politicians, whatever. It doesn't matter and i don't care. In the political world that is ancient history. .

There is more important things to do, to apply pressure to than worry about the delicate sensitivities of people who don't like Hillary Clinton.

If she wants to come out, speak out, be part of this supposed unified front than I am smart enough to not say no and if she has something to say, to rally the people now and for 2018 than i welcome it.

She is dead weight dragging the country down.

I don't want to waste time commenting on things that are irrelevant to what I am saying. I don't believe i could be anymore clear on that now or before. When nothing i speak of is about any specific weakness or issue Clinton had in the campaign.

Like I said, if you want to rehash the primary or talking about what Clinton's weaknesses or issue in the campaign were find somebody actually having that conversation to do it with. That was never my point or path. Thanks.

<TEXT>  And Jill Stein had no legitimate chance of beating Donald Trump, so a vote for her wasn't a vote against Trump, it was a vote for the Greens.

Semantic b.s. excuses is what that is.

Plain and simple there were plenty of ways to vote against Trump.

Literally vote for anybody that isn't him than you think would do a better job.

but she can't give that to people without inflaming others

Literally nobody can, not in 2017.

This is politics. Adam Schiff is getting a smear campaign because of what he says about Trump by Republicans for instance.

Any Democrat that says anything will inflame others.

At a certain point you weigh the options. Is inflaming ignorant Rs and Ds worth rallying everybody else with the capacity to think critically?

Is speaking out or acting out for the greater good better than sitting idly by or quietly by while policies are rolled back or enacted that will hurt people?

I don't think so. 

Anything that can rally people now to act now and act in 2018 is what we need. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And she did, throughout the transition and much of the first 100 days.

Trump's honeymoon is over, frankly it never started.

As the former candidate she allowed for a peaceful transition of power, she did not try to undermine the election results in public comments, she has let Trump try to govern, give him the time to be President and enact or change policies.

We all have. 

But it's a continual face-plant after face-plant on issues and policy be it by the WH or the Republican congress. When it's not a face-plant it's a rollback on regulations or policies that appease the ignorant and reward the corporations or the wealthy all while trying to spin as if it will be beneficial for Joe the former coal miner.

Rallying the people to apply pressure to congressman is exactly what Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been doing. Hillary Clinton 'ought join the likes of them now that the first 100 days of the Trump administration near their end.

To what end do you expect somebody who has the history of public servitude as a Democrat to remain silent on a Republican administration that is dismantling policies that:

A) This D supports

B) Does more harm than good, or is at least projected to do

This "thinking out loud" or "asking rhetorical questions" he'll never get an answer to are his bullshit way of throwing his weight around to rile up his base to attack people and groups to do or do not do certain things.

Lets not pretend Trump isn't asking them or telling them to stop covering Russia and do the wiretapping bullshit.

Sean Spicer does it.

Trump surrogates do it.

Trump does it. He's done it in the past, he's done it today in these tweets.

<TEXT> Obviously we all know the Republican's first swing at healthcare failed horrendously. Based off of comments from politicians they seem to be signalling they will be moving on to ~~impeachment~~ tax reform and infrastructure. Personally as somebody who lives and works in NY i think infrastructure in America, at least the north east corridor could use a pick-me up. Whether or not that gets done in a manner in which the work is done properly and the cash not pocketed by organizations or companies remains to be seen. As does President's Trump much talked about Trillion dollar infrastructure plan. So basically at the heart of the issue, moving from healthcare to tax reform and/or infrastructure do you find the fact that the GOP is effectively putting Healthcare on the back burner and moving on as their attempt to distract from the fact that in 1998 the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell and plummeted 16ft through an announcer's table. I feel as though healthcare oughta be a important issue given that fact. </TEXT>

Which specfically mentions Michael Steele former RNC Chair.

https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele

Which is from the twitter page for this report Paul Brandus

I mean the information this guy claims Steele told him is easily verifiable because Steele is a public figure, on CNN. This Brandus fellow is in the WH Press Corp.

<TEXT> Really?

Yes really. I didnt say Gorkov is or was a spy just that he went to the russian spy school.

I believe I missed typed in my previous comment that made it seem like i said there was no proof. I apologize.

Also you may want to take a peak at my link about the FSB. They do have schools which are claimed to be non-government focused.

Okay, fine. Personally I cannot find anything in that wikipage so if you can point out specfically where that would be nice.

How can I link to proof if even you agree there isn't any? but the proof that supports our educated guesses is classified.

But there is proof. His biography from Sberbank and VEB Bank both say


In 1994, he graduated from the Academy of the Federal Security Service of Russia with a specialization in Law.


Okay so what is Academy of the Federal Security Service of Russia. Well that is Russian spy school, that is The FSB Academy. The school the trains and schools people to work in the Federal Security Service of Russia as well as other Russian intel organizations.

Here they have a website

http://www.academy.fsb.ru/index.html

I mean for crying out loud it used to be called "The [Russian name] Higher School of the KGB" We all know what the KGB is most famous for being? Russian spies. 

The school Sergey Gorkov went to is the Russian Spy School. It can't be anymore clear. Whether he went on to work as a Russian spy in the financial world remains to be seen but let us not pretend he didn't just got to some run of the miller place of higher learning in Russia.

 Is there proof that the school was in fact a spy school 

Yes there is. Just look into the school itself, everything i've posted from the articles to the website for the dang school.

Gorkov was a spy

Nobody said he was a spy just that he went to school you go to to become one, to receive that type of training. 

Was there anything from stopping you from posting? Why are you, a random internet stranger, in a position to tell me, another random internet stranger, what to post? There are two people who can tell me what to do. You neither gave me birth nor do you let me fuck you doggy-style on Wednesday nights.Basically - don't tell me what to do. You're not my real dad.

Furthermore, all this bullshit. I don't know why you are acting like such a snowflake over it.

I was trying to help back up your claim Gorkov was FSB trained, showing proof that he was since he went to that school.

I was trying to explain it's far more useful to link to the proof he went to such school than linking to something that does not show the banker did what he did.

<TEXT>  There is no unclassified "proof" that Gorkov is a spy

I didn't say there was. I also never said he was a spy. In fact, nobody here said he was. Not I, not Rachel Maddow, not any of the articles i linked to state that i believe. Just you. 

So let me be very clear in restating, Sergey Gorkov went to the Russian spy school for schooling. Period, fact. Source? His biography of himself from the bank he was the deputy chairman at.

What I did say was this:

It makes more sense to link to proof that Gorkov went to FSB spy school or the Maddow segment when she discusses this instead of the FSB wikipage

What I also asked you to do is instead of linking to the wiki-page for the FSB is that it makes more sense to link to link to proof that somebody is FSB trained, proof that somebody went to the Russian spy school instead of just a link to the wikipedia page for the FSB as background information. Okay, background information is nice but that's literally burying the lead.

Making a claim that Kushner met with FSB trained banker and then choosing not to link to proof or a citation that said banker is "FSB trained" or "went to Russian spy school" is a poor thing to do.

The point is the proof is there. It was stupid of you to not include such proof in your "fixed" comment that really didn't fix anything but raise more questions to anybody who is not abreast to the situation or the nature of Sergey Gorkov/Jared Kushner situation

If this information is so classified why does it literally say Sergey Gorkov graduated the Academy of the Federal Security Service of Russia aka Russian Spy School in his biography on the bank he was employed?

https://www.sberbank.ru/en/about/about_sberbank/sb_management/board_members/sgorkov

I've also included a number of news reports saying how Gorkov graduated Russian spy school. You should add them to your comment as proof instead of a useless like to the FSB wikipage.

So in closing I'd like to say I proved a Russian banker Jared Kushner met with with a direct Russian source and I don't even work for the intelligence community. </TEXT>

No, they are experts.

I don't understand why you are acting like such a a snowflake over the word "conclusion" so much so that you cannot answer what is a horribly simple question. It shouldn't be pulling fucking teeth for what is supposedly you god damn opinion.

For the third time now i will ask:

"how do you come to that conclusion?" that Trey Gowdy ~~would be~~ ~~could be~~ maybe be Chairman if House Intel?

Because you don't get it, you aren't saying the same thing you did. You are the only person characterizing what you said.

I said I would be 'concerned' if Gowdy was put in charge.

Yes and no. You said you would be concerned but what you said is that

**Gowdy would be put in charge.**

Not if. But would be.

There is a difference between what you literally said and what you are now claiming you said, using the word "If". "If he was put in charge" and "Would be put in charge" are sentences with different implications for the reader.

"Would be put in charge" sounds like it's already a done deal some how. This is why i asked, why i continue to ask, how did you come to that conclusion? </TEXT>

Saying Gowdy would be put in charge if Nunes is removed from the House Intel committee is a lot stronger than a speculation, you are claiming this to be a strong possibility.

I ask again on what grounds did you reach that conclusion that Gowdy would be named House Intel Chair over any other Republican currently on the committee?

<TEXT>   it wouldn't generate any waves?

No i said it wouldn't have huge political implications.

 It would be one of the biggest news stories this year

No, it would not be one of the biggest news stories this year. The chairman of the house intel committee resigning because he acted inappropriately is no where near being the biggest story of the year.

We both know exactly how this will spin. He would understand his error, still claim that the information he discussed was unrelated but didn't want to appear partisan until proven otherwise.

We can talk about what we think he did but thats all unknown.

What we do know is he acted inappropriately as chairman and was on the transition. Given the outrage of his actions he would resign under the guise of not wanting to be partisan.

We dont know with what information did he act, with whom he discussed. We don't know a lot about what happened, it's just it looks really bad.

But lets not pretend like this would be some canary in the mine situation because it's not and would never be spun that way by the GOP.


Further, it would basically confirm theres real teeth to this investigation and that the GOP candidate won the presidency with Russian assistance totally delegitimizing him.

What? No it wouldn't lol how on earth do you come to that ridiculous conclusion, that sounds more like an anti-dream than logical reality.

It would just confirm the chairman acted like an idiot without thinking, even if the information he said he discussed was irrelevant. It doesn't confirm anything other than Nunes not having any foresight and being an utter moron.

I think it would be a part of the biggest story but Nunes alone being one of the biggest stories of the year is hyperbole.

<TEXT> But the election was valid, at least the only part that matters in the validity of the election, the actual and physically voting. Votes were not changed or faked or anything like that.

The spread of misinformation to sway the minds of voters is one thing and i think a very different action and issue than the changing or faking of votes. But that action as taken by a foreign government doesn't invalidate the votes of the people IMO.

I think the best way to phrases it is Russia meddled in the presidential campaigns but not the physical election of Trump via vote meddling. 

This is not to say what Russia did by the spread of misinformation, false facts, fake news and such isn't a big issue or anything, it's just one i dont think constitutes an invalid election or constitutional crisis. Just a crisis of a different kind. </TEXT>

No, the constitution lays out an order of succession that needs to be followed.

Trump leaves and you get Pence, he goes and it's Paul Ryan and so on and so forth down the list until you get to somebody that is not guilty of an impeachable crime or is impeached.

You don't remove the President and immediately jump into making a constitutional crisis. </TEXT>

You were talking about qualified.

You mean to say somebody who was a Representative, Governor and VP is no more qualified to be POTUS than somebody with 0 political experience?

0 governing experience.

0 knowledge of politics or how things work.

Is that what you are saying? Because i disagree strongly. Both Pence and Ryan are eminently more qualified to be POTUS than Trump ever was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, im not butthurt, and you misinterpreted what i was asking.

No i didnt misinterpet anything.

I have conversations with republican/conservative friends who i know will immediately handwave the source since its website is "lawnwz

If ~~you are~~ "people" butt hurt over a website name nothing will change your mind.

 i was asking and being hopeful wed find another source more "trustworthy" with a better source that gives the same info.

What you are looking for is a website that appeals to the delicate sensitivities of conservatives on facebook.

To hell with that b.s. IMO

If people can't be bothered educate themselves about news sources than let them wallow in their ignornance. If a "Z" at the end of a URL suddenly invalidates the truthful, factual information contained within the article and the experience of the person who runs it then yeah dont waste your time, i wouldn't. 

This source when they report legal news is trustworthy. There is no reason to pussyfoot around calling them "trustworthy." That implies they are in fact not trustworthy which is false. 

If people can't handle a simple explainer that a source is wholly legitimate and experienced because of a letter in a URL than fuck that kind of ignornance or maybe not ignornance so much as it is stubbornness.

I think an example to illustrate differences could be:

Lawnewz is trustworthy

Shareblue is "trustworthy" </TEXT>

<TEXT> First things first, this is not fucking true.

and less than 24 hours later the entire democratic wing was calling for Attorney General Sessions to resign because he had the audacity to meet with the Russian Ambassador.

He is and was called to resign because **he lied about it**.

When asked multiple times, he denied it. People from the Transition denied.

If its a fucking meaningless meeting why would you lie about it? 

Why would you offer up in a congressional hearing that you had no contact when that wasn't even in question and you still offered up a lie.

**This is not about meeting the Russian Ambassador. This is about lying about it over and over and over for seemingly no good damn reason**

  Trump gave a very nice joint sessions of congress speech where he called on unity and putting aside petty partisan fights to pass improved healthcare and a 1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill.

When will Trump put aside petty partisan fights?

When will Trump stop making the judiciary into a partisan issue?


When will Trump apologize for the birther shit?

When will Trump apologzie for lies about Obama wiretapping him?

Why on earth does Trump or the Republicans who peddle his bullshit deserve to have democrats "put aside petty partisan fights" when they continue to propagate them both based in half-truths and full-lies?

I don't think anything was meant to distract anything from something that is going to very public, has been known to be happening for roughly a week now.

I don't really find it becoming that everytime Reddit gets stuck on a story that anything else that happens and controls a news cycle for a day or two is suddenly meant to distract you. 

Especially when it comes to the wiretapping lie and fact that the House Intel has no proof as per intel agencies or the fact that the Secretary of State publicly put preemptive military action on the table against North Korea, or the fact that the meeting between Merkel and Trump was supposedly tense and not hunky-dory.

Who pray tell is trying to distract everybody from this well known fact of what will be happening on Monday?

<TEXT>  she is in fact not liberal



Also. I know my personal experience is not rule of law but I have many conservative family andfriends who gag at the thought of Hillary. Wheb Bernie comes up the response is usually, I don't agree with him but at least hes honest.

Thats the important bit right there as to why many folks don't think Sanders could win.

Yes he's seemingly honest normal person but he is very liberal to a point where even if he has redeeming qualities as a human, the spending policies, the "big government", not conservative economically thing would greatly impact his chances, turning away or at least giving weariness to many conservative independent voters.

That is the most important factor i think that would contribute to his loss. Yes he's nice but he's the furthest thing from conservative and that's a breaking point for many voters especially when it's egged on by the Republican political machine.

People this election wanted change. Theyre tired of corrupt politicians. There tired of corporations owning their law makers. Trump offered real change.

What?

Trump didn't offer change. The only change is he wasn't a politician and just said whatever stuff was on his mind, no filter.

Outside of that, not very different than the archetypal corrupt politician.

Being tired of corrupt politicians and corporations owning law makers is one thing, totally fine. 

But than deciding the solution is a corrupt private citizen who is owned by corporations is not the solution.

Donald Trump offered change, that change being he will be corrupt, lie, cheat and steal out in the public with no shame.

I get that there are places in this country that are scared about the future of the economy, their jobs so on and so forth. I understand that but Donald Trump never offered change. He offered a safe umbrella for you to get under and hide from fairly inevitable things. Such as related to jobs, energy, etc. </TEXT>

 President Trump's administration asked Monday for more time to comply with a House Intelligence Committee request for evidence substantiating Trump's claim of wiretapping.
 
 But according to CNN, the Senate Intelligence panel has received a response to its inquiry into the presidents allegation.
 
 "I've talked to all the appropriate people," Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told CNN. He said he has received "sufficient" responses about the wiretapping claim.
 
 "I would say from our conversations, what we've gotten are sufficient answers, he added, though he would not confirm if there was evidence backing Trump's claim. </TEXT>

It's a lot more genuine if you didn't lessen her importance and come back around with a compliment for seemingly no reason other than to be the first one to point out she's not doing anything but connecting the dots and verbally telling the story.

Seems like preemptively fighting a battle nobody else is engaged in. </TEXT>

She is not in the line of succession so long as she is **not** Speaker of the House. Which means the Democrats would need a majority of the House and that ain't happening here.

He's clearly lying. He can't look at Hayes and say no to a number of things.

The interview was horrendous, i will be excited to read professional opinions on Page's body language because it was bad. Looking away, smiling awkwardly. He rarely looked Hayes in the eyes when he denied doing things.

Also, anybody else watching Maddow? She was leaked a confirmed DHS Intelligence document put together by State, ICE, DHS, USCIS and another that CITIZENSHIP IS NOT A GOOD DETERMINER FOR TERRORISM.

 She was interviewed by CNNs Jake Tapper after her visit in Syria and she uncovered some details that the CNN host did not like to hear. The Congresswoman disclosed strong evidence that Obama and his administration funded these two terrorist organizations.
 
 Gabbard said that Syrians expressed happiness and joy at seeing an American walking their streets. However, they also enquired as to why is it that the United States, its allies and other countries, are providing support, are providing arms, to terrorist groups like Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, who are on the ground there, raping, kidnapping, torturing, and killing the Syrian people?
 
 They asked me why is the United States supporting these terrorist groups who are destroying Syria  when it was Al-Qaeda who attacked the United States on 9/11, not Syria. I didnt have an answer for that.
 
 Tapper reacted by saying that, Obviously the United States government denies providing any sort of help to the terrorist groups you are talking about, they say they provide help for the rebel groups. </TEXT>

For somebody people who think will be some unstoppable force she isn't exactly putting herself out there in person. She's seemingly shut up after that trip to Syria sketchiness/controversy

Even a search on Youtube i see an interview with Tucker Carlson, an appearance on CNN and an interview on RussiaToday (RT)

Most if not all of them regarding Terrorism/Terrorists and her trip to Syria.


edit:

Thinking on it more, i don't think she is nessarily a bad politician but i admit that i am influenced by other supporters. I do get turned off by those in the "cult of personality", those who believe somebody is the savior or the 1 who can fix everything.

I'd like to think she is a good person and will be a good Rep for the people of Hawaii but personally looking to the future I couldn't give a shit if she ran. She a long fucking way to go before i ever even consider voting for her for anything.

Personally, somebody who I could support that has shown truely good colors since the election has been Al Franken. I have yet to see or hear that from Rep. Gabbard but i also understand she doesn't have the opportunity to grill Cabinet members like Franken has. 

A few written statements and little from her in person out in the mainstream consciousness just isn't good enough for me as a voter or a potential supporter. </TEXT>

Rep. John Conyers is ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and Rep. Jerrod Nadler is ranking member of the Judiciarys Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Subcommittee. 

Conyers was critical of Richard Nixon during his tenure, and as a result was number 13 on President Richard Nixon's enemies list during Nixon's 196974 presidential tenure. The president's Chief Counsel described him as "coming on fast," and that he was "emerging" as a "black anti-Nixon spokesman."

Conyers voted on the Articles of Impeachment against Nixon in July 1974. He is the last remaining member of the House Judiciary Committee who did so </TEXT>

Does a black crime section exist on Breitbart News' website?

It doesn't seem like it.

There it is misleading. They are saying the policy is drawn comparisons with a section on Breitbart that seemingly does not exist.

Just seems more useful to be honest and say something like "has already drawn comparisons to the actions of Breitbart News who often publish articles highlight acts of crime committed by Black people while choosing not to highlight acts of crime committed by people of other skin colors."

Currently I only see:

He didn't. Nor does the article say that.

Seeing as you did not read the article:
 
 TRUMP: "Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs."
 
 THE FACTS: Many of the announcements reflect corporate decisions that predate Trump's presidential election, making it unlikely that his administration is the sole or even the primary reason for the expected hiring. </TEXT>

Really? Not even a guess?

A) it's new information on an on going story

B) it's a story about the American president and one of their biggest adversaries

C) it's gives some credence to the theory that the dossier is true. In that the source is creditable not necessarily that he was paid for the information I mean

Nobody should be unsure why this is news.   </TEXT>

There are those in this thread that criticized Democrats or Clinton supporters for doing that in the election and now they are the ones doing it.

Take not that ya'll are a minority. You don't get anywhere with 0 help, you don't get anywhere with 0 allies or support.

<TEXT>  In all seriousness, why does the opinion of these specific men matter?

1) For wanting "in all seriousness" you made a very lackadaisical and seriousness comment. So i will go sentence by sentence and explain this to you.

Because they are high-ranking military people in the Dept of Defense so they have 1st knowledge how money is best spent in the DOD.

They also have the experience to understand taking money from other important depts to fund their own is not the best way to get that money. 

"Oh, they've killed middle eastern civilians, so they know everything there is to know about war!"

Defense department budget is not war FYI.

I mean, you think Trump is sitting in his office with a notepad writing down the international agenda all on his own? Does he not have an entire team of highly experienced advisors that all come together, and decide what's best? 

And a group of highly experienced military person ell don't know what's best for...the military?

 But oh no! 120 random old fucks have all the answers!

No, it's 120 retired military generals.

 And they've signed a petition so they should be given executive authority!

No, they've signed **a letter** to congress advising them on what to do.

Why is this even news?

Because Trump has touted he has so much support from Generals.

Because Trump has also said he knows more than the Generals.

WHY DOES THEIR OPINION MATTER MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE?

Because they were high-ranking people in the military, which is in the Dept of Defense.

Personally, I think coconut oil should be 100% subsidized (I use it for masturbation), where's my CBS article?

Is the US Gov't or W.H. currently proposing a change in the subsidization of coconut oil or anything regarding that product?

No. So no news, no article. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Conducted by a catholic institution,

1) It wasn't conducted by a catholic insitution.

2) It was sponsored by CRUX, meaning they paid for it. They didn't do the polling. They may have even worked with the polling company to come up with the questions and refine the.

2a) The Marist Institute for Public Opinion aka Marist Poll aka Marist College conducted the poll, sponsored by CRUX.


 no information on who was polled,


There is plenty of information on who was polled. This is a Marist poll, often posted during the primaries and election.

545 adults

Aged 18+

Residing in contiguous United states

Contacted on landline and mobile phones

English and Spanish

Live interviewer

Between 12/12/16 - 12/13/16

Source: https://www.docdroid.net/ArVWFKT/crux-marist-poll-national-nature-of-the-sample-and-tables-february-2017-1.pdf.html

then cites its own results as facts like "1 out of ten Americans" blah blah...

The Federalist doesn't state anything like a fact. They use the same kind of language nearly every other media outlet that reports on polling does. Same kind of phrasing and wording. Same goes for the CRUX article, nothing about this is shocking or new or out of the ordinary. Nor is it as negative and you make it out to be.

Not very scientific.

The above information begs to differ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many people won't vote for someone without what they see as relevant experience, such as a military background.

Which is equally as dumb.

Why is it a "dumb fucking issue" for me to want my representatives to have relevant experience in living like their average constituents?

Because single issue voters are dumb. 

Deciding on whether or not to vote for somebody because they have money says nothing of their policy, nothing of their experience. At least using military as an issue shows experience, at the very least it can show leadership experience or something.

What difference does it make if the Democratic Presidential candidate was wealthy as fuck but transformed the low income communities around him and tried to raise people up or if the Republican one was poor but did nothing or propose nothing good to help other poor people?

Would you vote for the poor guy with no ideas or experience or the rich person who has shown results?

<TEXT> Oh please, let's be real. It's normal. What Trump did and has said is seemingly acceptable to a vast majority of people including members of Congress.

But drawing the line at the WHCA Dinner is laughable. Drawing the line here does absolutely nothing. You wanna say "Don't normalize it" every time Trump does something as President fine go ahead but from an observer the continued repetition is silly and stupid especially when it comes to this very instance.

It's normal now. This is the world we live in now. If you didn't want it to normalize you're about 1.5 years too late.

If you "dont want to normalize it" then you don't cancel the WHCA Dinner. You don't appease Trump because that's what he's doing. You know what the best thing for Trump is?

Not having an entire night devoted to pushing his buttons and bashing him and his administration in an intelligent and funny way.

You know what happens when you boycott it or cancel it? It's not that hard to imagine how it would be spin positively for Trump and negatively for the "fake news media."

Anybody who comes into a political party and demands full and unequivocal change and appeasement are obnoxious. They are whatever other negative ridiculous adjective you wish to ascribe to them.

Period. Doesn't matter what political party in America, if you are a member of it and outsiders come and make demands or threats, expect to meet with "Bitch, please." responses. 

You need to show the political party you want to change results. You want change, you start to make it, you get results. You do not go in, lose an election and essentially what is seen by members of the party as emotionally yelling or whining. You do not name call people, you do not insult.

You challenge, you challenge their beliefs and their politics with an alternative you feel is better.

So this is for everybody. Progressives, do not call Democrats "neoliberal" or anything else like that as if it's an insult. Do not insult the people in the party you are trying to change, you will fail.

Non-progressive Democrats. Do not call Progressive "Bernie bros" or "Sandernistas." Stop alienating and insulting people who can help. </TEXT>

Asked on Fox News Sunday WALLACE: But -- but just to button this up very quickly, sir, are you saying that if you become president, you might try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage? TRUMP: I would strongly consider that, yes.

--------------------------------------------

Trump Compared Opposition To Same-Sex Marriage To Disliking Extra Long Putters In Golf. At one point, he compared his opposition to the legalization of same-sex marriage to his reluctance to use a new kind of putter. Its like in golf, he said. A lot of people  I dont want this to sound trivial  but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive, said Mr. Trump, a Republican. Its weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they cant sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist. [New York Times, 5/2/2011 ]

--------------------------------------------


Trump Said He Would Tell A Gay Grandchild Well, Its The Way It IsI Have Been Against [Same-Sex Marriage] From The Standpoint Of The Bible But He Would Still Love And Cherish Them. When asked by Bloomberg News how would he explain his stance against same-sex marriage to a gay grandchild, Trump responded, Well, it's the way it is, Trump said Wednesday during a Bloomberg interview with Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. I wouldnt speak to them at all about it other than they are who they are, and I want them to be happy and I will love them and I will cherish them..Ive gone to gay weddings. Ive been at gay weddings, said Trump. I have been against [same-sex marriage] from the standpoint of the Bible, from the standpoint of my teachings as growing up and going to Sunday school and going to church, and Ive been opposed to it, and well just see how it all comes out. But, you know, if I was ever in that position I'd just have to explain it. [Huffington Post, 8/27/2015 ; Bloomberg, 8/26/2015; VIDEO] </TEXT>

I might go so far as to say he is a more level headed, journalistic O'Reilly. Whom i also feel wants the President to do good, regardless of party but will still heavily criticize and praise when the occasion or action calls for it.

Journalist IMO is very broad, it doesn't take much to be a journalist.

Commentator, reporter, correspondent so on and so forth are more specific IMO and all fall under the catch-all-term of journalist.

Bill O'Reilly much like Sean Hannity don't break news. The react to it.

Shep, Wallace, Hemmer, Baier break  the news. Maybe not so much Wallace since Sunday magazine shows are different but regardless.

Whether or not this aspect of journalism or reporting is due in part to O'Reilly or Hannity's desires or success may be partly true. What is also partly true is doing taped news programs that air at what 8pm and 10pm respectively. </TEXT>

Hannity, O'Reilly are pundits first. Hannity is a supporter. O'Reilly, i can't really says. But much of that comes from the prominence of Fox having a number of shows that are more opinion first, news second than the other way around.

<TEXT> Just because you don't say the words "The definition of state-run media is" does not mean you are not distorting the definition or the phrase to make a point.

When you say this:
 
 Wallace claimed, "We don't have a state-run media in this country."
 
 What he fails to recognize though is that our mainstream media is anything but diverse and free.
 
 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America
 
 http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6

You are strongly implying that Wallace claimed something and it is wrong because of this reason.

You are saying Wallace claimed we don't have state-run media and he is wrong because he failed to recognize that much of the mainstream media is owned by a handful of corporations.

Corporations that have a history of working with the government or lobby the government to their benefit rather than the benefit of the people who consume the news media from those division of the corporations. </TEXT>

Why should the people of WV and ND vote against their best interests by voting for a candidate who doesn't support their way of life, their interests or values? Because some "liberal elite's" feelings were hurt by HRC losing?


 I dont care that West Virginia is a coal state and it is a specious argument for Joe Manchin to say that he didnt want to offend his coal industry folks.  Bernie Sanders, a hater of coal and a huge advocate for tough and immediate action to fight man-made climate change and a huge advocate for massive environmental protection won the Democratic Primary by 15.6 points and **might even have won the entire state in the General.**


 
 And I dont care that Donald Trump won North Dakota by almost 36 points.  Those people didnt, and many of them wouldnt vote for Scott Pruitt and Heidi Heitkamp shouldnt have either

That bolded bit, a huge fucking might. And is that might worth risking 1 if not 2 Senate seats on? Instead of risking it on a feeling, risk it on a fact and run with Manchin and get him to win, keeping his seat. Win else where, win Reps, win Senate seats where the risk does not outweigh the reward.

 This is the third such survey by the organisation, which began polling the panel of presidential experts in 2000
 
 The poll ranks each US president on various issues, including "crisis leadership", "moral authority", "international relations" and "pursuing equal justice for all".
 
 Obama scored particularly high on the "equal justice" scale, coming in third behind only Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865) and Lyndon Johnson (1963-1969).

<TEXT> Then you have to answer to others why accept Keith Ellison? People shouldn't just wholly accept him in a leadership position for the whole reason is he is not stereotypically establishment.

Establishment is not bad. Poor leadership is bad. DWS was a bad leader, establishment or not. She failed at her job and replacing her with a progressive Democrat doesn't fix leadership problems if the replacement is a poor leader and somebody that can't organize to get others elected.

Tom Perez and Keith Ellison both seem like fine leaders regardless of politics. But this is about getting people elected, establishment or not. It's about getting Democrats elected, plain and simple.

Given the way Harry Reid lead the Nevada Democrats to fairly consistent winning against trends and who he endorsed that's who I think would best choice. But it's not me you have to explain, why people should accept Keith Ellison.

You should have a good reason to accept somebody or want somebody in a leadership position.

It's equally ignorant to dismiss or accept Tom Perez because you might say he is establishment as it is to dismiss or accept Keith Ellison solely because he's not. 

In my book for some people, let me be clear when I say I'm not saying you are, I've seen on here to use that as there only criteria, establishment or not as a means of choosing a politician is short sighted. </TEXT>

Their failure is one of the primary reasons we're living with a Trump presidency.

No the reason we're living with a Trump presidency is because Hillary Clinton didn't campaign enough in the states that mattered when it came to white working class folks in the middle of the country.

We are living in a Trump presidency because HRC did not appeal to the needs of certain voters in the same way that Trump did.

The media is not a primary reason we have Donald Trump as president. </TEXT>

The only issue is having people who don't necessarily qualify as journalist and more just commentators or bloggers. I have to agree with the Trump administration on this point because i think it's a fine thing to allow people representing local news affiliates to ask questions thru this method. What i wouldn't agree with is allowing people who represent highly politicized blogs and sites that sound like Conservatard.com or GOPNews.net, i.e. sites that clearly distort the truth for an agenda rather than add their own commentary to the facts </TEXT>

  then why was DWS fired for rigging the primary?

She was not. She was fired because she acted inappropriately as DNC chair as evident through emails. She spoke of doing things and favor a candidate which is against the rules of her organization.

Why was Donna Belize fired from CNN for rigging the primary?

She was fired for sharing questions with the campaign(s). Not rigging an election.

Why did DNC lawyers argue that Bernie supporters had no leg to stand on when they sued because they should have known the primary was rigged? 

Why are Hillary sycophants still lying and saying the primary was not rigged, after the DNC already admitted it was rigged?

Rigged? No, presence of a DNC rule-breaking bias? Yes.

For example, Rick Washik, donated to the Sanders Campaign between February 2016 and June 2016, months after posting a link to a petition that claimed that Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz was biased. Catherine Cyko, FAC  19, donated to the Sanders Campaign between February 28, 2016 and June 30, 2016, after she posted an article accusing the DNC of bias.  Marlowe St. Cloud Primacy , made her first reported donation to the Sanders Campaign on March 8, 2016, several days after posting an article accusing the DNC of bias.Rosalie Consiglio,, made her first reported donation to the Sanders Campaign a week after posting an article accusing the DNC of bias

This sample demonstrates that, aside from not being actionable, Plaintiffs theory that donors relied upon Defendants statements about neutrality to make donations they would not have otherwise made is not plausible

What the DNC argued is that somebody gave money to the DNC after the fact they were aware of the idea that DWS has a bias and using it to affect things professionally. It make's a bit of sense, if you think something is corrupt and your money might not be going where it should be, why the fuck are you still giving them money, and then you expect to get it back? Seems silly but i would also think things through and not donate to an organization that seems shady or at least not 100% transparently truthful but i digress.

because Hillary and her cronies prevented the best people from having a shot.

It's never Bernie Sander's fault or his campaign' fault right? It's not his fault he didn't expand his base and pick up minorities early on that would have won southern states? It's not his fault his campaign was disjointed and poorly run according to those who actually worked on in some places.

Bernie Sanders' didn't get the nomination because he was running in an unwinnable race or at least a highly unwinnable race for numerous reasons. From reasons related to the experience and strength of the opposing campaign, to the name recognition of the opposing campaign, to biases from people who were in positions to push the needle. From his own campaign's faults as well.

There is no single reason Bernie Sanders' lost.

The division of the Democratic party is not the fault of HRC or Bernie Sanders, its the fault of, ignorance, gullibility and fake news or not wholly accurate reports.

Copy/Paste from WrestlingInc -- http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0322/591618/michael-cole-on-preparing-for-wrestlemania/

**How privy he will be to what's going down at WrestleMania:**

If I wanted to know, I could know everything. But I don't want to know and especially at WrestleMania. A perfect example was last year with the Undertaker and Brock Lesnar. **When Undertaker's streak was ended by Brock, oh, my God, I was as shocked as the people sitting at the stadium that night inside the [New Orleans] Superdome.** I had know no idea in a million years that was going to happen, and that was the reaction you got out of our call hopefully. I was expecting The Undertaker to kick out and I did one of my normal "One, two" and I was expecting to say kick out and all of a sudden it was three. **I looked at John and he looked at me and I mouthed to him off-air, "Is it over?" His eyes were big and wide and I said to myself: "Okay, the streak is over." I want those moments to happen.**

One of my favorite WrestleMania matches to call was the first time Rock and John Cena met in Miami [at Wrestlemania XXVIII]. I didn't know what would happen and it was such a great year-long build. It makes that moment so much better. At the end of the day, just like anyone else who calls any sport, we are fans of the product and we want to be as intrigued as everybody else.

**Who is in his ear during RAW:**

So this is the fun part of my job. People think I sit down in a chair and I look at the ring and say, "Okay there are two guys fighting and this is what they are doing" and call the match. That is, and I swear to God, so far from the truth. I sit down and in my headset when I am calling Monday Night Raw for three hours, **I have my executive producer, I hear my audio technician, I hear whoever is producing us backstage whether it is [WWE Chairman and CEO] Mr. [Vince] McMahon or Triple H or whoever it may be at the time. I also have two guys I have to listen to that I am working with so we can have a conversation on the air. So at any given time I have my voice, the two guys at ring side, audio, the executive producer and whoever is producing that night. So I sometimes have six voices in my head at once while we are on the air on live television.** While that is going on, someone might say that the number one trend in the world on Twitter is this and we have to hit on it. Meanwhile, don't forget to tell people why Paige is doing this to Nikki Bella. Then John may be telling me a joke and Booker T might be laughing and I have to keep all this going and keep the train on the tracks. I am a traffic cop.

**How hard it is to do three hours of RAW:**

When 11:15 p.m. ET rolls around, people have said to all of us, "You guys look like zombies. And it's true. It is mentally exhausting. And it is physically exhausting, too. I sweat through my suit sometimes. When I am done, I get in my car to drive to the next town and I completely zone out for two or three hours. But it is also rewarding every week. I love it.

**What he considers the greatest match he's called:**

I have done a lot of thinking about this the last couple weeks as we get ready for WrestleMania. **I think the number one match for me professionally and personally was Eddie Guerrero and Brock Lesnar in 2004.** Eddie had gone through a lot in his career and I was very close to Eddie. That night was a really special moment for me. I'd also pick the Mick Foley call the night he won the championship [in 1999] during the Monday Night Wars. Was it a great call? I don't think by any stretch of the imagination but what made that call special to me was the emotion in my voice. That was a special moment. Mick and I have been real close over the years because of our connection to Bruce Springsteen. We are both huge Springsteen fans and we both know Springsteen's guitarist, Nils Lofgren. That's sort has been our bond, and Mick gave me for my birthday one year a harmonica that Springsteen had used in a concert. Rock-John Cena I is up there too. That was one of my all-time favorite calls. And in retrospect, I would put last year's Lesnar-Undertaker match because of the historical significance and the surprise factor.

**Sting in WWE:**

He's a great guy, number one. Number two, I thought I would ever have the opportunity to do that. In my career I have called matches of some of the greatest guys of all time and Sting is one of those guys that I don't think any of us who have been all WWE all the time ever thought we'd have the opportunity to say, "Oh, my God, it's Sting."?

To be able to call him and Hunter (Triple H) at WrestleMania is going to be an absolute thrill.

**Paul Heyman:**

He is an absolute genius. Paul Heyman, a lot of people don't know this, used to be the head writer on SmackDown when I was cutting my chops as a wrestling announcer. He taught me so much about this business. If it weren't for Paul, I probably would not be in the position I am in. He is a genius.

*Something I found interesting in the SI article is as follows*

SI - *Let me read you something you said in an interview with prowrestlingnet.com that I found interesting: "People don't understand the amount of pressure that's on us as commentators to serve so many masters. First off there's the hardcore fans who have been watching for 20 or 30 years who want their old school wrestling. They want you to call a wrestling match; they want you to call every single hold, so you've got to please that. You've got to try to do your best. You also have to please your kids who are 50 percent of your audience and your women who are a large part of our audience too, so you're talking about different stories when it comes to those demographics. We're obviously in a PG era now, so you can't get away with a lot of things you could get away with 15 years ago."
So how do you take care of all these factions in a broadcast?*

MC - Honestly, you are never going to please everyone. It is impossible to do. We have to do what is best and asked of us. What people have to understand about our product is that we are entertainment. There is no ifs, ands or buts about it. We are an entertainment television show, just like watching Walking Dead or Better Call Saul. We are an entertainment show so we have to entertain. And we need to entertain a wide variety of people. Again, you have your hardcore fans that want it to be complete wrestling like it was back in the 70s and 80s. We dont do that anymore. That is not what we do. 

MC - Now obviously the way that I talk about our product and I will be dating myself: I harken back to the old television show Taxi. The show was based in a taxi garage and that is where the conflicts were ultimately resolved. But what was interesting about the show was everything that was happening in these people lives outside of the garage. It is the same thing that we do in WWE. Our conflicts are resolved in the ring but what is interesting is everything that is going on around that match to get us to that point. So it is hard to serve all masters and we just have to do what we can do. The other thing is, from the standpoint of women who watch our product, that demographic is growing immensely over the last number of years. It is one of the reasons the "Give Diva A Chance" revolution has started. Women watch our product so you have to serve that master. You have to serve kids. You will never please everyone but you have to go out and try do what you can to at least please the majority of the masses.

<TEXT> Having posted a thread not to long ago about podcasts I finally got into listening to some podcasts.

My question now is about comic books. I like to try and diversify the media I consume to try and have my hand in a bunch of different pots, looking for things i like. Which is why i wanted to get into podcasts, it was one form of media that is getting really big that i wasnt into yet.

I read my first comic book last week **Superman Red Son** as I thought was a good starting off point. Its a stand alone story that i can read in one go. I followed that up by looking for a Batman one and found **Arkham Manor** which sounded cool and I read all the issues and will continue to as long as new ones are coming out. Lastly, I started the **Guardians of the Galaxy (2013- )** series and have throughly enjoyed what i've gotten through.

Personally what makes me feel overwhelmed is all these crossover things. Like can i just read say a series in the New 52 without having to read 12 other series or ones that don't interest me despite having like these crossover things. 

I also am having trouble understanding the Marvel comics and how to read the ones that are coming out now. I understand that DC's 52 is a restart so you start at #1 for all the series and continue on (except Green Arrow which ive see that starting at #17 is better).

Other than the overwhelming feel i get trying to figure out reading orders or how to read a series or events/crossovers i feel good about the comics. I find DC to be a lot easier to start with their 52 rather than Marvel because even though i'm reading GOTG they still talk about thigns that happened in the past that i have no idea what they are.

----

I also plan to read the following

- Green Arrow (52)

- Green Arrow Year One

- Batman Year One

- Batman Killing Joke

- Batman Long Halloween

- Batman Dark Victory

- Gotham by Gaslight

- Gotham Noir

- Batman Master of the Future

- Skullkickers

---

Along with all that i'm looking to other characters or series to get into, i heard about the Suicide Squad film and that sounds like it would be an interesting comic story. I think i'd like the "bad guy group." But also i'll look into Deathstroke and some other DC series. But i don't know if i can figure out Marvel as ive said before.

<TEXT> What ring announcer, announcer a superstar the best? I came up with a couple off the top of my head and found videos for them. 

What superstars get the best, most enthusiastic introduction by the ring announcer or what ring announcer goes wild with announcing what superstar

[Lillian Garcia introduces Triple H at Summerslam 2007](http://youtu.be/KgV6to_tayU?t=4m15s)

[Justin Roberts introduces The Undertaker at Wrestlemania 27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHH0YgiD8WQ#t=77)

[Justin Roberts introduces John Cena on RAW](http://youtu.be/TafgRrE2fg8?t=18s)


I think its really just a contest to see how can draw out a superstars name the longest and i think Justin Roberts is winning with John Cena.

<TEXT> Across the board what are some of the best named and worst named PPVs in sports entertainment? 

Don't limit yourself to the WWF/E. Think about TNA, WCW, ROH.

Obviously there was a time when PPV wasn't a thing but those's yearly titled shows from back in the day pre-ppv should still be included in this discussion

Obviously, I like Wrestlemania. I like it even better when they have the intro to DVD's an there is the audio of the guy, maybe Vince, maybe Fink that says "WELCOME TO WRESTLE..MANIA!"

TNA's Victory Road has a nice ring to it. Knowing little to noting about TNA is sounds like it could be the PPV that leads into Wrestlemania </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, I'm a mod of /r/YouShouldKnow  and thanks to some input and sugguestions from our community members we've deicede that the current flair, while it works, would work better in the same style has /r/randomactsofcards

What I'm trying to accomplish is to

1. Get rid of user applied post flair

    1a. I know how to stop users from being able to apply their own flair in the subreddit setting

2. Create a submit button for each of our categories (which are currently the flair choices

3. Upon clicking the Submit a Technology YSK the submission page will have the submission title prefilled with "[Category Tag] YSK ......."

4. Have AutoModerator remove posts that do not begin withi [Category Tag] YSK...

    4a. I will be able to write teh AutoModerator functions as i understand

What I don't have a strong grasp of is what CSS changes to be made. While I did the CSS of the subreddit, i haven't really followed up on creating my own personal website and doing codecademy lessons, i have kind of forgotten most of what i thought i knew.


I've attached a link to a conversation I had with a subscriber discussing the issues. What i'd really love is some sort of step by step instruction for creating the buttons, then implementing  submission box, etc..

Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't get what I'm doing wrong. I've tried doing pulled pork in the slow cooker 3 times and each time the meat is un-pull-able. Its just a tough mess. 

I've put liquid (water) in the slow cooker, i've done it without liquid. I don't have the first recipe I tried but maybe I cooked it for too many hours. 

I just coat the meat in dry spices and put it in on low but it is never tender, fall off the bone. It goes from raw to tough.

I've only used bone-in pork shoulder from the super market. Roughly 4.5 to 6.5lbs is the range i can get in the store.

Today, I tried this recipe

http://www.tasteofsouthern.com/pulled-pork-bbq-in-the-oven-recipe/

I followed it to the tee, save for putting on mustard, liquid smoke and worchestor sauce. Was that a mistake? 

Is there some sort of unspoken rule for making pulled pork that is assumed to be common knowledge and isn't put into recipes.

Its very frustrating and I can't figure out what to do and discouraging me from taking out my slow cooker again.

If you need any specific information go ahead and ask.

Thanks for the help :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I think this subreddit has gotten better in the past 6 months. That quality of posts has gone up and I think the number of bad posts has gone down, due in part to the community reporting posts and the implementation of AutoModerator, which removes posts based on certain pre-determined keywords as defined by the rules on the side bar.


I want to know what the community thinks of this subreddit.

What can be done to better improve the posts in this subreddit?

Should new rules be added to the subreddit?

Is the tagging flair system working for posts? 

I haven't figured out a way to remove posts that have no flair without going individually and doing that. Which is something I don't have the time to do. I think  70 to 80 percent of posts have flair which is good but i would want all of them to have it, very much in the same vein as /r/woahdude 

So, know-it-alls what are you ideas for the subreddit? Things to change, things to stay the same?

There's been little moderation in this subreddit because it doesn't seems its needed unless to remove bad posts and comments. Are there things you want the mods to facilitate in the subreddit, such as weekly/monthly discussions or things of that nature.

We are at 367k and change subscribers and I think we can grow even bigger just as LifeProTips has.

-------

I think some things for everybody to remember is to report posts that are bad. Report posts that are false, report posts that the community as whole deems bad. Such posts will then be removed and comments too. In some cases reporting is how we find out there is a user that is going to get banned since I don't click through the posts often, when somebody reports a comment or when we get a message from AutoModerate that a comment has been reported 5 times and we check it out and its a troll, then we ban that user or take action to remedy.

Also, what are your thoughts on the quality of the post, not just the YSK in the title. Are posters discussing their YSK or just posting and leaving. Do you want a body to the post that discusses the YSK?

Are YSKs about Reddit something you want here? I often just point people to FAQ about reddit or other reddits because I see this subreddit to not be about Reddit or facebook YSKs.

------------

That is all for now! Respond away with any ideas your have about this subreddit or about how /r/funny isn't funny. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-01-24 01:06:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, long story short last week i got a ~4lb bone in pork shoulder to make pulled pork for the first time. I followed the recipe 

http://civilizedcavemancooking.com/crockpot/crockpot-pulled-pork/

*4lb bone in shoulder

*Various spices

*1/4 water

*Onions on the bottom of the cooker

* Cook for 8 - 10 hours on low

Aside from changing some spices to my personal taste. My dilemma comes from the aftermath of the 8 hours. 

I took it out after 8 hours and to be honest, it had the consistency of pork chops (or at least to my mothers pork chops). I had to work to get it to pull apart and even then it didn't really pull.

I suppose it was tender to the fork but it wasnt fall off the bone tender

Is this because it was not cooked long enough or cooked too long?

Did it matter that it had the skin on one side which i left on when i put it in the cooker? Skin side up.

I've been trying to figure out what may have went awry but i cant really seem to find a general consensus as to how you should/could cook a bone in shoulder.

Now, today, i got a 4lb boneless pork shoulder and would like to try again this weekend. So, is there any advice you guys/girls may have or recipes that are more well written than the one i used? Ive searched the sub for anything similar to what i experience and i wasnt able to find anything </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think we as the subscribers/community of /r/YouShouldKnow should talk about what this subreddit is turning into. 

It seems that from reading the comments on many posts here that the quality has definitly decreased or at least the quantity has increased and thusly the number of low-quality posts have increased accordingly. This subreddit is no longer a small community IMO with over 300k subscribers we've grown quite large.

I've noticed in the past few weeks/months a growing number of posts in which a majority of the comments complain or discuss the post and how it should have been put into /r/todayilearned or elsewhere. I've also noticed a lack of regad for the 4 rules that are on the sidebar including posts that contain an agenda or call to arms, which i think is the most important one (aside from proper titling)

As a one who often vists and post in this subreddit I can only point out what i've seen and what i think should change. I personally speaking think we need better or more moderation. Perhaps moderators who don't mod the large Million+ subreddits. Moderators who can have some time to deal with what this subreddit is turning into, a low-quality TIL/YSK forum. Whether it be more or better rules or more/new moderators I cannot say for sure. I also think it would be nice to have some good CSS considering we are a lot like /r/LifeProTips, a community with good CSS and organization.

These a merely my ideas, what I would do if I had the powa. What are yours? Clearly there is are strong feelings toward the state of the subreddit (i think) so we should share them. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 12 Years A Slave - My feelings after viewing [Possible mild spoilers but I don't discuss specfic events in the film.] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-20 06:20:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [I don't mention specfic moments in the film, this is fairly vague but again read at your own risk]

12 Years A Slave

I went in with preconcieved notions of what the film would be, what it would be like, what it wouldn't be like. I've heard people say it's like Schindler's List and I've heard people say Fassbender's slave owner makes Leo DiCaprio's (Django UnChained) look G-Rated. I've been told it's an "experience" and an "emotional rollercoaster." I've been told numerous things along the same lines but you get the gist, I'm sure you too have read reviews or other pieces about the film.

I would first like to say that the cinematography is fantastic. The use of the framing and camera movement or lack of movement was incredibly well done. As was the camera's relation to light in the film, the film was lit stunningly. Hans Zimmer's score was something that was both odd and out of place but perfect and right. It sounded and felt at times "Inception-esque" yet it fit the period of the film, it fit the setting of the story in an odd yet satisfying way. The acting overall was pretty good which from my view goes to say the directing was great too because in some scenes I wouldn't know what to say to the actor to ellict the preformance, emotions, look or feel that came out the preformances in 12 Years A Slave.

All that being said I felt there to be something missing. I was not on the edge of my seat, I was not crying nor was I caring. What is shocking that a slave owners wife threw a crystal alchoal bottle at a female slave's head? For some people in the theater yes it was, the gasps and flinching at certain moments such as this and various other instances of violence were and are expected. But I felt like the story was missing something, I didn't care about the character(s) at the end of the film. Is that something wrong with me or the film? Am I the heartless basterd who can't feel for these characters or did the film's story not do a good job to make me care. 

I went it wanting it to be fantastic. I went in under the assumption it would be a film festival and award show winning film. But I left the theater with a feeling of lacklusterness. The most recent films I've seen in theaters were Captain Phillips, Last Vegas and 12 Years A Slave in that order. I would go see Captain Phillips again over seeing any of the others for a second time. Although the first two i was emotionally invested in the characters, I and many other people in theater cried or nearly cried during Last Vegas. I was on the edge of my seat in Captain Phillips even though I knew full well what was going to happen. 12 Years A Slave did neither of that for me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> For Your Information: Breaking Bad   The Emmy Awards </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-16 23:32:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel that many of you are unaware of how the Emmy awards work. I will try and explain some of the more important rules and procedures for you.

1. The finale eight episodes of Breaking Bad are not eligible and therefore not going to win any Emmy awards this sunday at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards

This is because the eligibility window for these awards was June 1 2012 - May 31 2013. Which means that only the first half of season 5 is eligible for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. The second half or finale eight episode are eligible to be nominated for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards which will take place in 2014 NOT on sunday. 

2. Actors/Actresses who are nominated for Best Supporting/Lead are nominated for their show from one episode, not the entire season. When the network or production company submits their shows/episodes the actors are nominated for their preformance in one episode. 

Bryan Cranston in nominated for "Say My Name" the 7th episode of the 5th season. Jonathan Banks is also nominated for best supporting actor in a drama for the same episode and Aaron Paul for "Buyout" the 6th episode of the 5th season. Anna Gunn (supporting actress) is nominated for her performance in "Fifty-One" the 4th episode of the 5th season

2. Breaking Bad is nominated for best series but the voting was only on the first 8 episodes of season 5 because that is what is eligible for the Emmys. The Best Series Emmy takes into account all episodes of the submitted show's season.

3. The writing and directing Emmy's for drama and comedy shows (not including variety shows such as Colbert/Stewart/Fallon/Kimmel) is only for one episode. Which means any show including Breaking Bad can only one a writing or directing emmy for one show that was submitted for nomination. Breaking Bad has two different episodes nominated for best writing and one for best directing in a dram series.

Do keep this in mind that any Emmy Award Breaking Bad wins on Sunday has absolutely nothing to do with the finale 8 episodes that we have been watching over the past few weeks. The voting for the 65th Primetime Emmys occurred long before the finale eight were finished.

To repeat the finale 8 episodes of Breaking Bad including "Ozymandias" will be eligible for Emmy nominations in 2014 for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards.

<TEXT> I just found out about these earlier this month when i saw these large yellow lockers in one of my local 7/11s and they turn out to be Amazon Lockers. Which are lockers that you can have products, that are handled via Amazon and within certain dimension restrictions delivered to. I think that these are very useful for people who leave in urban areas where packages my be taken off your stoop. I'm currently in University City, Philadelphia and i can see this being a safe alternative for having items delivered to me should i choose.

Having read into the service here:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201117910

You put the address of the locker which you can look up the nearest one to you and it's shipped there. The downfalls i see are that if all the lockers are full the delivery person will try again the day after so one must relie on the promptness of people to pick up their packages in a timely manner.

You also are emailed the electronic password to the locker in which your package is placed once it has arrived at the locker and i assume that these passwords change but i'm not sure.


All in all, i think that this is a nice service and a fair alternative to the post office/p.o. box if your post offices are further away or something.

<TEXT> **PC = SHIFT + ALT**

/u/Ulaer 

Yes, but its a little bit trickier. Launch Netflix and then wait a second or so. Then using the left stick on your Xbox controller click up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, up, up, up, up. This may take a few tries to get it right. If you mess up just wait a second then try again. If performed correctly, it should open a menu showing some of the things mentioned above as well as a "Log out" option. 
 /u/familydoubledare pointed out that you can use the D-pad for making this procedure easier.


/u/growlingbear

Its select on PS3 


/u/sudosudont

Ctrl+space pauses the movie and enters key frame mode (aka intra-frame or i-frame mode). The right and left arrow keys then move between key frames.

The following 

Ctrl+Shift+Alt+* shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+Option+* in Mac OS X)  toggle information displays on/off when the player is NOT in full-screen mode. The displays will remain on, however, if full-screen mode is activated.

Ctrl+Shift+Alt+M  Menu;  includes loading custom .dfxp sub-title files.

<TITLE> YSK That not all plungers are created equal and that there are different plungers for different drains. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-30 19:51:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Did you know that there are different plungers?

You probably did because you've walked through your local super-market or chain box store.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/kTgCblp.jpg) and [This](http://i.imgur.com/1U7wWeh.jpg) are **Cup Plungers** and are designed to unclog sink and bathtub drains. These are also the classic or original plunger designs and can be used for toliet bowls but are more suited for sinks/bathtubs because **your toilet bowl drain is curved** The bottom of these plungers is flat so it is more difficult to form a seal with the bowl

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/YQOdQGB.jpg) you can see the differences between a sink plunger (on the left) and a toilet plunger (on the right). Toilet plungers are also known as **flange plungers.** 

This more modern design is better for toliet bowl uncloggin because of it's curved shape it is significantly easier to get a seal between plunger and bowl and with the increase in size you trap a large volume of air in the seal which makes for a more powerful plunge.

You should also remember that as with anything price matters. Cheap plungers will not preform as good and for as long as ones that cost a more. 

Additionally you should have a cup plunger and flange plunger just because of the specific uses but also because you shouldn't be using a toilet plunger in the sink because of sanitation issues. 

------------------

Here are some steps for how to plunge a toilet properly. 

Place the plunger in the bowl so that it forms a seal.

Push down slowly until the cup of the plunger is completely compressed.
(WARNING: This is where people cause damage to their toilets! If you push down too hard, you will push the water through the wax seal between your toilet and the floor, and then you will have to call a plumber.)

With a quick jerk, pull the plunger back.

Repeat until the toilet drains.

So youre wondering why on earth would you want to pull the clog back up? Youre trying to send it down the drain, right? No, actually. Youre trying to dislodge the clog. It got stuck on its way down. You need to back it up so it can try to go down a different way. Thats what the quick backwards motion does: it rocks the clog back and forth, just like a car thats stuck in the snow, until it can move forward.


--------------------

Hope this helps, its my first YSK tip :) Cheers </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine was [Glory](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097441/), i was in elementary school, 5th grade specifically and we were studying the civil war and they wanted to show us this movie so we all had to bring home slips to have our parents sign so we had their permission to watch it and one day they brought a bunch of the 5th grade classes into the lunch room and we watched the movie.

<DATE> 2012-12-06 04:11:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Probably around 1995 but i'm not sure. All i can remember is it was an animated film, hand drawn i believe and the scene that i remember took place in the rain with a boar. Wild boar i assume may have been chasing somebody/something, there may have been a river boat and bears involved as well. I'm not sure if the animals were anthropomorphic but assuming it's a 90's Disney-esque children's film it's not out of the question.

I also know for a fact it is not Disney's Robin Hood film </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just watched the two part mini-series. Overall I really enjoyed it from both an audience standpoint and filmmaker stand point. The story and characters were cool and interesting and Eddie Izzard plays a great pirate.

I also enjoyed the look of the show, with the odd visual effects/camera movements/focusing etc. It very a great breath of fresh air from other programing. But, I very much like the premium television shows/tv mini-series.

I would suggest to anybody with a weekend to spare to watch The Kennedy's or for longer invest of time, Deadwood, The Borgias, Hatfields/McCoys.

Back to Treasure Island, I would suggest it to everybody its a total of 3 3 hours, split into two 1 1/2 hours episodes, with a bunch of great actors/acting and a high quality production that looks really good.

This exludes anybody talked about or seen in only flashbacks to events prior to Game of Thrones, such as Rhaegar Targaryan, Arthur Dayne, etc, etc.

Let's try to keep this as spoiler free as possible for those who haven't read the books. So let's try not to say blatant spoilers such as "I choose X because he killed Y and therefore he's better."  Get creative with your reasoning!


At the end let's tally up who are the most popular and create a Kingsguard for the subreddit, or just see who the three most popular warriors you guys chose for your Kingsguard! :D

I'll go with:

**Sandor Clegane**

**Tywin Lannister**

**Oberyn Martell** </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I say "friends" because I understand that the system isn't really for creating two way communication between two people but rather as a notification or flagging system when a friend posts. But still, i'd think it would be interesting to know who if not how many people "friend" you on Reddit.

I imagine the reasoning for some people adding others as friends after good interactions with them or after the person posts something interesting and they continually provide good content to the community.

<TITLE> I'd like to drive across the country (USA). Do you have any advice? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-02-19 17:56:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, Reddit.
To give you some background information I'm going to be part of a summer program at my university where they send us out to Los Angeles for internships. Anyway, because of what the program entails I would really want to drive across country for a couple reasons.
1)The experience of driving across country
2)So I can have a car out there and I don't have to relie on borrowing somebody else's car in the program.

(I'd be leaving from either Philadelphia or New York)

My concerns are that my university is on the quarter system and there is 1 week between the end of spring term and the start of summer term.  

My concern is whether or not I will have enough time to drive out there in a week. I would not turn this into a vacation stopping everywhere as much as I may like to. Logically, I would want to drive out there with more than just myself so that we could spend more time on the road by switching drivers. If I couldn't get anybody from the program to drive with me I would try to convince my father to drive out with me and i'd fly him back just so I could have a passenger to share the drive with.

I hope I've made my concerns clear for you to read, if not just ask.
P.S. - Some of the professors have said the university may be able to get a deal with a car rental place in L.A but considering 99% of us are under 21 the rates for a rental car driver being under 21 would still be a lot. I am 20yo.

If you have any other suggestions please do tell :)

**TL;DR Is driving to L.A. feasible within a week?
What would be the best route to get there?
Would flying out and renting a car be better?** </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are they actually building in front of the Hans and McAlister? I've heard from a couple people it's a new dorm thats going on top of the dining center. But, frankly that just doesn't seem like a feasible idea. I've also heard they are putting another stop light somewhere on Chestnut near that area. 

Anybody hear anything else/different? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey r/Photography can I get your input on an 
upgrade? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-01-15 23:03:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey r/Photography, I'm looking to upgrade my DSLR. I have a Nikon D5000 with some additional equipment but I'm looking to leave Nikon to go to Canon. For one I got this Nikon back in high school before I was aware of what I wanted to do in college (which is being a Film major). Since then I haven't really stayed up with any new DSLR news and things of that nature aside from the Canon 60D/7D/T3i. I currently have a Panasonic HVX200 which is a digital video camera I purchased recently and quite enjoy it. The reason I'm looking into the Canons 
-is primarily as an all aronud upgrade from my Nikon
-i can tell you i'm leaning toward the 60D, as the 7D as alot of nice features but really features i don't need such as the FPS. I won't be shooting any baseball games or anything like that so the FPS on the 60D would be suffient.
-Lastly I would use the Canon as another HD Video camera as the DSLR for video is a trend that is picking up and some clients do like that style and it does fit certain applications.

-So I'm hoping for some input to just "reassure" me that the 60D is what I'm looking for, which after speaking with my local camera shops back home in NY (in school in Philadelphia) I'm feeling strongly towards that. Or is the 7D worth the extra however much exact money it is for the additional features/upgrades that the 7D has compared to the 60D

Much appreaticed if you take your time to respond.
