<TEXT> Don't buy a brand that you never heard about. 
My frist mistake was buying a psu cheap and when it died it went with my all  components.

Good luck  </TEXT>

What are your current drivers.

<TEXT> How often does this happen? 
What you can do is set windows to full performance in power  settings.  
If you are using windows 10 disable directx 12.
Sadly there is no fix since AMD and Nvidia are getting this problem. 

For me putting full performance on windows settings helpt. 
Good luck  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pre alphas or so called Pre released games are becoming more more frequent. 
You have to understand that when games are doing that they need a majority of players. 
To even see if they game has no hype flaws , be tweaked or maybe change its course. 
Look at killing floor 2 when they announced micro transactions. 
Dayz when it's hasn't seen the light of the word beta. 
H1z1 "said no micro transactions" which they lied about. 
And people stay pay for it. 
Waiting for that sweet sweet release. 
Trust me on this. If they don't have a official date and yet released the game as early access. 
It's legal scam. Who ever thinks it's ok to have unfinished games needs to be slap with a wet fish. 
Stop following this trend  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am leaving the game or Cuz heart of thorns was a huge disappointment for me. 
No new dungeons 
Meta huge grind events. 
Raids. Not even sure why they called Raids. 
1 new map for pvp. 
People defending this content is what hurting the game. 
Not even get me started on pvp. 
Disable new traits for f2p and non heart of thorns players it's a huge Wtf.
That's disabling the base core of a game. 
It's just forcing you to buy the expansion.

<TEXT> I don't think it's the right stuff you got. The lg3 has built in sensor to connect to the wireless charger. So putting the sticker from the product you have..might interfere with the receiver.. Try to use it with out the sticker. Sorry for my bad English  </TEXT>
