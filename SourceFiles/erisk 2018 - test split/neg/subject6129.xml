As I said there are no innocents in those wars. Now, after obviating your bias, let's get back to the essence WHICH was that the picture shown is NOT what it is presented for, the same way acts of genocide took place not only in Bosnia and not only against Bosnian Muslims. </TEXT>

Germans were repatriated from Kaliningrad which changed the demographics and respectively the language spoken there. Nothing like California where the Hispanic/Latino population continued to grow and is a majority in the State of California now. You see the difference? So sending back population which was already there before the whites and offering the 8th largest economy in the world and the largest US state economy to secede and claiming that nothing will be lost is kind of inane. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You, specifically, suck at many other things but that's what karmawhores like you do. If you did intentionally posted the NSFW pics knowing that they were **FAKE** I wish your family the same. Cause we take things personally on the Balkans as some lying douchebags from other parts of Europe might have noticed. 

# So here is  about that pic titled "Two kids killed by Serbs" in your photo diatribe:

*Those are not kids, first! Second, that's only a snippet of the pic. Third it's in Vukovar and not Srebrenica. And last but NOT least, those people are SERBS, killed by the Croats and there has been plenty of such cases when the NATO countries scum masquerading as UN troops, blamed the Serbs for their impotence and sheer betrayal of the local population.*

**"As Croatian forces withdrew from Vukovar on 15 and 16 November 1991, they dragged Serbian civilians from the cellars where they were hiding, and massacred them. These Serbs were axed to death in a courtyard, after being dragged from the cellar at 74 Nikola Demonja Street in Borovo-naselje, near Vukovar [Names, courtesy of the 4international blog: Radosav Pavic and Velimir Trajkovic (both wearing red); Zorica Pavlovic, her brother Zoran, mother Nada and Milojka Pavlovic.]"**

The photo appeared in the March 1993 issue of the now defunct British magazine Living Marxism, my convergence with whom I explained here. The article was titled Hidden side of the Yugoslav war: the pictures they dont want you to see, and explained:

The British government has banned an exhibition of photographs showing atrocities committed against Serbs in the civil war in the former Yugoslaviaunder sanctions imposed on Serbia by the United Nations. Croatian and Muslim groups from the former Yugoslavia have been allowed to stage their own exhibitions of atrocity photographs in Britain without hindrance.

Living Marxism takes no side in the Yugoslav conflict. But we have sought to expose the distorted way in which this war has been presented to people in the West. In particular, we have opposed the dishonest campaign to demonise and scapegoat the Serbs

[Original captions by Living Marxism preserved:](http://www.juliagorin.com/wordpress/index.php?s=dorich paged=2) 

You can google that image yourself and stop whoring and spewing BS. [Here is NSFW!!! Srebrenica for you](https://zarfiinfo.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/ekskluzive-masakra-e-srebrenices-ne-fotografi/) but NOT that pic hosted on imgur. 

That's just to remind you that that there are always at least two sides of each story.

<TEXT> The origin of militia is Latin. Basically it means armed citizen army/forces for self-defense purposes i.e. armed citizens defending their own and that was its original and genuine purpose since 1580s when these formations appeared in the US where most likely the concept was adopted from. The militia is a self-defense against criminals and later one during the War of Independence against the professional British army trying to stifle the popular revolt. So the original idea has just a partial overlap with the modern concept used by the MSM though not that remote to cause confusion. And indeed, as mentioned below, it has to do with the socialist idea that those are armed representatives of the citizenry/ the masses defending it/them from law-breakers and criminals thus to make the difference between the police which defended the rights and the property of the bourgeoisie but not the proletariat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why American Airstrikes Go Wrong
By ERIC SCHMITT and ANJALI SINGHVI	APRIL 14, 2017

The Pentagons laser- or satellite-guided bombs and missiles almost always hit their intended targets. But because of human error  sometimes compounded by technical glitches  the military has a history of mistakenly killing civilians or allies. Here are five causes.

Poor Communication
An American gunship hit a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, last year, killing 42 people.

In major military blunders, rarely is there just one culprit. Human error as well as equipment and procedural failures can add up to devastating consequences. That was the case in the attack on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan.

The problems started when missile fire forced a lumbering AC-130 gunship, sent to eliminate a compound swarming with Taliban fighters, off course. Its targeting systems homed in on an empty field instead.

The crew spotted a collection of buildings that roughly matched the description of the Taliban compound. The gunships navigator called an American Special Forces air controller on the ground to seek guidance.

The response was immediate and unequivocal: Open fire.

The air controller was wrong. Even after Doctors Without Borders frantically alerted American commanders that a gunship was attacking the hospital, the airstrike was not immediately called off because the Americans could not confirm that the hospital was free of Taliban fighters.

Sixteen American military personnel, including a general officer, were given administrative punishments for their roles in the strike.

Right Target, Wrong People
A coalition airstrike on Tuesday aimed at Islamic State fighters killed 18 Syrian fighters allied with the United States.

In the fog of war, distinguishing between friend and foe can be perilous. Allies and enemies are commingled on the battlefield. What looks like an insurgent from data gathered from spy satellites or surveillance planes may be a more complicated target.

In the airstrike Tuesday in Tabqah, Syria, Syrian fighters allied with the United States were mistaken for insurgents. Allies on the ground had called in the airstrikes and identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position, the Pentagon said, using another name for the Islamic State. But the location turned out to be a position for the Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been fighting the Islamic State alongside the Americans. The military is investigating.

Without eyes on the ground, targets can be misleading. Several missiles fired from a C.I.A. drone in March 2011 struck a meeting in northwest Pakistan among locals and Taliban mediators who had gathered to settle a dispute over a chromite mine. While some of the three dozen people killed were Taliban fighters, Pakistani officials said, most were elders or simply residents.

American officials sharply disputed Pakistan's account, saying that all those killed were insurgents. These people weren't gathering for a bake sale, an American official said. They were terrorists.

Reliance on Local Allies
An American airstrike called in by Iraqi special forces to kill snipers ended up killing as many as 200 Iraqi civilians.

Ideally, American spotters would be able to call in all American airstrikes to help avoid accidentally striking civilians. But in war zones like Iraq and Syria, where small numbers of American Special Operations forces are advising indigenous troops, the advisers must vet and approve information relayed from allied troops closer to the fight. Its an imperfect arrangement forged in the crucible of combat.

American commanders in Iraq say that an airstrike in Mosul last month that killed scores, if not hundreds, of civilians hit the right target, but that the choice of target relied on partner forces who may not have the same values or standards, especially when it comes to risks to civilians.

The top American commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, acknowledged that the airstrike most likely led to the building collapse that killed the civilians. But American officials have also said that the Islamic State may have herded the victims into the building as human shields, or that the attack may have set off a larger blast from explosives set by militants inside the building or nearby.

Maj. Gen. Maan al-Saadi, an Iraqi special forces commander, has said his men called in an airstrike to take out snipers on the roofs of three houses in Mosul. The Iraqi forces, General Saadi said, were unaware that at least some of the houses were filled with civilians.

Nearby Civilians
Two American airstrikes in 2016 and one in 2015  both in Mosul  killed civilians near designated targets.

Often, civilians stray too close to a target after an American or allied warplane has dropped its weapons, and the pilot is unaware or cannot abort the strike.

In a significant number of the 85 strikes involving civilian casualties that the United States has acknowledged in Iraq and Syria, noncombatants entered the so-called killbox after the weapons were released, according to Airwars, a London-based organization that tracks civilian casualties in war zones.

On Feb. 12, 2016, and again four days later, airstrikes were carried out on Islamic State car-bomb factories in Mosul. American commanders concluded that two civilians were unintentionally killed in each strike when they entered the target area after the munition had been dropped.

American commanders also concluded that an attack on an Islamic State headquarters building in Mosul in 2015 killed four civilians in the building and wounded two others.

Flawed Intelligence
A B-2 bomber mistakenly struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1999, killing three people and wounding 20.

American military planners draw on a range of aerial, human and other intelligence to help plot airstrikes, always seeking to prevent civilian deaths. Even so, that planning sometimes goes awry. Most famously, flawed targeting techniques, outdated maps and sloppy follow-up on the ground led to a disastrous result in May 1999.

Satellite-guided bombs from a B-2 bomber struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo War because C.I.A. analysts misidentified the building, and military databases used to catch such mistakes had the wrong address for the embassy. The intelligence failure led to a deadly case of mistaken identity that killed three Chinese and wounded 20.

When the target was initially checked against electronic mapping data in American military and NATO computers to protect against civilian casualties, no red flags were raised because half a dozen government databases listed the old location of the Chinese Embassy, in another part of Belgrade.

A secret document that President Bill Clinton used in authorizing the strike, obtained by The New York Times in 2000, described the Chinese Embassy as a warehouse.

The intended target was the headquarters of a Yugoslav arms agency. Intelligence analysts in Washington apparently picked the Chinese Embassy, which had been in that location for only two years, without vetting from anyone on the ground.

Then it's /r/worldnews, where kids defeat enemies on the PC as if it is a video game. Some joke. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see you are spewing dumbshit warmongering BS all over the subreddit from behind your PC (like everyone else here, in your defense). Here are some bullet points for you to consider before mouthing off your rather ignorant and idiotic war apologetic. First, no US admin built the bomb (MOAB), it was my and other taxpayers' money who paid for it. Hammer that in your head if you are a taxpayer (which I doubt) and when the next 9/11 happens. Although bombs fall from the sky, it's the taxpayers that pay for them, so i.e. there are no innocent people in the game called war. Take it whichever way you want and remember that chickens come home to roost next 9/11. Second, unrelated to this post but to your other BS, China will NEVER join the US in attack on NK, so the US is on its own there with SK. I bet a million bucks SK would not like to see a war conflict a la Korean War 2.0 with nukes, fo sho. Whatever the result, the victory will be a rather bitter one. The global outcry and everything else even worse. Why? Cause NK might be whatever the half-witted MSM brainwash ppl to think but hey, they didn't attack anyone. Same goes for all the countries like Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia etc that the US ATTACKED. Third, the US Govt/CIA financed those tunnels (w/taxpayers' money), now they destroy them again w/ taxpayers' money. Do you see the idiocy here? I doubt it. WHY is all this ??? What is our interest in Afghanistan and NK when 99% of the US population can't find those on the map? So quit watching TV and solving world problem on your computer if you are not aware that you are actually paying (in case you pay taxes) to create more such. My pleasure. </TEXT>

But the condensed imagery and shocking metaphors which were delivered not only thru the content/semantics but also conveyed thru the form/syntax and lexical material (words, neologism, literary techniques) were what swept me off my feet. He deconstructed the whole system of language - words, word order, even the graphic arrangements on the page to deliver the message in the most powerful way i.e. he was ready to break any rule of grammar/semantics to get to the point. For me he was an epitome  and embodiment of his time.

<TEXT> There is a raging war in Afghanistan and the Taliban are closing on Kabul. The dumbshit yankees were warned that this will happen when after 9/11 they started the offensive against their own proxies they used in the war against the Soviets. And they were warned by no one else but the military experts of Russia. The bottom line is over 3000 US military dead and counting plus hundreds of millions if not more thrown down the drain. The Afghanis flood Europe because they can settle and receive political asylum although all of them are economic migrants abusing the misguided EU criteria for granting political asylum. The main problem in this case, as with the Iraqis and the Syrians, is that those immigrants belong to the Wahhabi/Salafi Sunni Muslims (read Al Qaeda/ISIS) and they are the one that are radical and Sharia-minded. So briefly, trouble is ahead for the EU but that was the whole idea of the schadenfreude from beyond the pond i.e. the US, expressed unwittingly by the dumbshit former US Asst SoS Nuland in a different situation as "Fuck the EU!".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's all theatrics. He most likely knows it wasn't Assad and it was all another White Helmets Hollywood show (If you want me will link a "witness video" with the dead kids where one "dead" kid couldn't wait the shoot to end and opened its eye) but he's getting in deep shit here and taking a blow after a blow - with his executive orders, with his staff appointments, almost on all fronts. So he had no choice but show some balls, which in fact is just a dick waving, 'cause you understand that if they warned us the airfield was cleared from military staff and working equipment ASAP and they left just things that can't be moved as hangars and  fuel silos and some malfunctioning equipment. So it's much ado about nothing but the US population will get the message that he's a tough guy though he's just another talking head and the next idiot in US politics. To be fair, I expected quite a bit more from him. Never liked him and clearly saw he is a clown. Same with the other witch bitch - HRC, a hyper-disgusting person though talking reasonably if we exclude her warmongering which is the biggest NO NO in my book.

PS. It wasn't Assad fo sho. The US just dropped the idea of regime change in the UN. The declaration blaming the regime was postponed too. The attack was by SAA Su-22 which can carry just standard missiles which CANNOT be retrofitted to carry gas canisters (such attack could be carried only by choppers and barrel bombs). If you have paid attention no one ever showed any bomb shrapnels with traces of chemicals as evidence (and there should be enough of those). Also you don't handle sarin attack victims without gloves as shown by the AQ Helmets. Two Turkish MPs made a statement Turkey provided the terrorists with sarin. The source could be Libya, Iraq or KSA too as the CIA planned such provocations to justify the regime change and as Carla Del Ponte, the chairman of the UN commission, investigating such attacks in the past (2013), mentioned in an interview the evidence collected leads to the terrorists. Also J. Kerry, in front of the UN, stated back in 2014 that the last batch of chemical materials that could be used in chemical weapons and belonging to the Assad Govt was disposed of back then. Assad is winning the war and there was no justifiable reason to tarnish his name in such a senseless way unless s/o thinks he's an idiot, which he def is not.

<TEXT> No, if it wasn't true then there would be bomb shrapnels with traces of the chemical used paraded on the MSM. And if it wasn't true some "expert" should explain and show how a SAA Su-22 could shoot other than standard equipped missiles (which can NOT be retrofitted to carry gas containers). And if it wasn't true then [Turkish MPs wouldn't claim that the gas was provided by Turkey to the terrorists which has happened in the past too in similar cases](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/sarin-gas-materials-sent-to-isis-from-turkey-claims-mp-eren-erdem-34286662.html).

<TEXT> Can't agree on either of these. [Germany is quite big in homosexuals, in fact the biggest in the EU](http://www.towleroad.com/2016/10/germany-lgbt/) and also:

In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in **the Netherlands, France, Slovenia and Spain. Sweden** is the only country that allows marriage between half-siblings and they must seek government counseling before marriage.[134]

The most public case of consensual adult sibling incest in recent years is the case of a brother-sister couple from Germany, Patrick Stbing and Susan Karolewski. 

In the Netherlands, marrying one's nephew or niece is legal, but only with the explicit permission of the Dutch Government, due to the possible risk of genetic defects among the offspring.

Historically:

Many European monarchs were related due to political marriages, sometimes resulting in distant cousins (and even first cousins) being married. This was especially true in the Habsburg, Hohenzollern, Savoy and Bourbon royal houses. However, relations between siblings, that may have been tolerated in other cultures, was considered abhorrent. For example, the accusation that Anne Boleyn and her brother George Boleyn had committed incest was one of the reasons that both siblings were executed in May 1536.

<TEXT>  He has always seemed like the type of person who would prefer to build his control over the population by focusing them on an imagined enemy to fight against, as a way to ignore the problems that aren't actually trying to be fixed with the country.
 It's similar to the tactics used by the Republican Party in the US

I have a few pretty simple questions:

1. So who/what exactly is that "an imagined enemy" you talk about? Examples.

2. Indeed, that type of tactic is typical for the US, most recently however it's a part of the strategy of the Dems, not so much of the Reps, and again fear mongering in the US is a more of a State/Govt policy in general.

3. Why are the names of those murdered not mentioned? They def have nothing to hide anymore or fear for their lives. Do you, or anyone, expect people to be moved just by some MSM claims not supported by facts? And as you are the one making parallels with the US - how about that SINGLE act in Orlando where 49 gay people were shot dead and many others wounded?

<TEXT> **EU Says It Cant Block Russia-Backed Nord Stream 2 Pipeline
EUs executive arm proposes negotiations with Moscow to ease the security concerns of some member states**

By EMRE PEKER

BRUSSELSThe European Union is giving up on efforts to stop a Russian pipeline project and instead proposing negotiations with Moscow to alleviate the security concerns of some of its members.

Under pressure from about a dozen governments led by Poland, the EU had been attempting to block Nord Stream 2, which would provide a second gas link from Russia to Germany and double the Baltic Sea export capacity of Russian state-owned energy company, PAO Gazprom.

At stake is increasing the blocs reliance on Russian energy at a time when Brussels has sanctioned Moscow for its military intervention in Ukraine and EU governments warn of political meddling by the Kremlin. The pipeline would allow Russia to divert its gas shipments to Europe away from Ukraine, cutting off an economic lifeline for the country beleaguered by violence and instability.

In a March 28 letter to the Danish and Swedish governments, seen Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, the European Commission, the EUs executive arm, said it has no basis to bar the planned pipeline.

Pushing for a political solution, the commission said it would seek a mandate from EU governments to broker a deal with Russia that would define Nord Stream 2s legal framework and align it with Brusselss priorities.

We dont like Nord Stream 2 politically, said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, an energy spokeswoman at the commission. This being said, there are no legal grounds for the commission to oppose Nord Stream 2because [EU] rules do not apply to the offshore part of the pipeline.

The letter, written in response to a Jan. 25 request by Denmark and Sweden for a prompt assessment of the pipeline project, ends a long-running debate on whether the EUs political concerns could be translated into legal action against Nord Stream 2.

Still, the commission reiterated its position that the project jars with EU objectives to diversify and secure gas-supply sources, curb dependence on major providers like Gazprom, and prevent a concentration of transit routes.

The commission sees no need for new infrastructure of the magnitude of Nord Stream 2, Vice President Maros Sefcovic and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Caete said in their letter. The commission will also continue supporting the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine.

Policy makers are crafting the commissions request for a mandate to broker a deal with Russia, and a timeline for the process is not yet available, an EU official said.

The Swedish port of Karlshamn is taking part in Russia's expansion of the Nord Stream pipeline, while the island of Gotland declined.

The commissions statements contain no major revelations, said Russias envoy to the EU, Ambassador Vladimir Chizhov. He declined to comment on whether Russia would negotiate a bilateral agreement with the EU on Nord Stream 2, citing the lack of a proposal for talks.

It is also unclear whether EU governments that have sparred over Nord Stream 2 would green-light the commissions bid to seek a deal with Russia.

Poland and other eastern members of the EU, which benefit from transit fees and supply security as long as Russia uses existing pipelines, staunchly oppose doubling the existing Baltic Sea connections capacity to 110 billion cubic meters a yearenough to meet Germany and Frances combined annual consumption.

Berlin, on the other hand, has sought to prevent political meddling in Gazproms project, which is also backed by European energy companies.

During an October 2015 meeting in Russia with President Vladimir Putin, then German Economic Affairs and Energy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the parties should strive to ensure that the EU doesn't get regulatory oversight of Nord Stream 2. If we can do this, then opportunities for external meddling will be limited, said Mr. Gabriel, who is now Germanys foreign minister.

Even if EU governments mandate the commission to negotiate with Russia, Moscow may have little incentive to sit down for talks on an intergovernmental agreement now that the EU has said it lacks authority on offshore pipelines.

For Nord Stream 2, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprom based in Switzerland, the commissions acknowledgment marks a major vindication. The companywhich had been planned as a joint venture including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Wintershall AG, Uniper SE, OMV AG and Engie SA until Polish regulators derailed ithas long argued that it is fully compliant with all laws and regulations.


The European firms continue to back the project, which has already committed 4 billion ($4.3 billion), applied for regulatory approval in Sweden, and shipped about 700 kilometers of pipes to warehouses around the Baltic Sea, more than a quarter of whats needed.

The commission confirmed that the national authorities are in charge of approving the project, which is something we have said all along, said Sebastian Sass, Nord Stream 2s EU representative. As far as an intergovernmental agreement is concerned, we dont see a need for that, because for us the legal framework is clear.

You can tell that to s/o who hasn't spent 40 years in his life in that same country and have seen quite a lot you haven't dreamed of as runs with the law and other shit. Save me the teen and post-teen enthusiasm. How about if I tell you I have ordered alcohol during the short-lived 'dry' law period, of which you probably don't know shit (USSR Andropov times), in socialist Bulgaria (serving alcohol before 12 at noon was not allowed) in Troyan and it came in a tea cup? Does that make me a member of the Resistance, a dissident and anti-totalitarian fighter? No one is gonna risk his relatively hard to get license just to make a couple of levs more. Some joke. </TEXT>

You wish. No pub or bar will sell you alcohol for sure, especially to a bachelor party bunch and I deeply doubt any establishment will host such a party on that day, so better buy your drinks the day before and as it is the local tradition have it in private setting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are some caveats though. The official (right or wrong) unemployment rate in Belarus is ~ 1%. (WiKi) though "Many unemployed people in Belarus are trying to avoid registration, because of obligatory public works..." So basically the law does not target ppl registered as unemployed as I understand but the ones who don't work and don't register as such which already gives some better perspective on why the law exists. It's interesting to have some opinions from Belarus ppl. Also in confirmation that it is bad journalism I can say that from what I saw Belarus does NOT struggle to quell the protest, they (the Govt) shut down the protest in no time and without any hesitation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   we lose our country once and for good (or for another 50 years maybe), or you guys will lose here in Ukraine.

You already lost your country, mate, the moment your Govt send the troops to shoot at their own. Donbass, as Crimea, is not your country anymore and only a blind person won't get it. You will lose in the rest of Ukraine, from where the blood thirsty scum filling the lines of the ultranationalist Ukro-Nazi Bandera rabble battalions come too.  Why? 'Cause people will realize that Maidan did not change the system, it simply put even more unscrupulous and corrupt ppl in charge. The difference ? They serve their own interests better and exploit the artificial divide they themselves created and fostered. Although it will be too late. I'm not Russian, not former USSR either, my country is in the EU but I've seen all that type of transformations and foreign exploits before, 25 years ago and was also for a change, on the side of where the honest ppl on Maidan stayed and got used by the corrupt who took over shortly. They went thru one and the same CIA script all over Eastern Europe. You are no exception. Good luck in your delusions and  - ,  - ,  - .   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a play of words, associations, alliteration and connotations, some semantic shit, to be frank:

First, it contains allusion to the KKK:

Creation and naming

A cartoon threatening that the KKK will lynch scalawags (left) and carpetbaggers (right) on March 4, 1869, the day President Grant takes office. Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Independent Monitor, September 1, 1868. A full-scale scholarly history analyzes the cartoon Guy W. Hubbs, Searching for Freedom after the Civil War: Klansman, Carpetbagger, Scalawag, and Freedman (2015).[46]
Six Confederate veterans from Pulaski, Tennessee created the original Ku Klux Klan on December 24, 1865, during the Reconstruction of the South after the Civil War.[47][48] The name was formed by combining the Greek kyklos (, circle) with clan.[49] The group was known for a short time as the **"Kuklux Clan"**. The Ku Klux Klan was one of a number of secret, oath-bound organizations using violence, which included the Southern Cross in New Orleans (1865) and the Knights of the White Camelia (1867) in Louisiana.[50]

But also from C. Doyle's Sherlock Holmes:

Have you never said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voicehave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?

I never have.

Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. Here it is, said he presently: Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful **resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle**. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War...."

So, briefly, **BLOODY EVIL RUSSIA**. Doesn't matter that the Klan historically was a pillar of the Democratic party in the US. Just browse Klan, Democratic Party and you will see some nice pics from 1924 :)))  </TEXT>

**In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that YOU POSSESS EXPLOSIVE INFORMATION about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers and the Russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity**

So he pretty well knew from the horse's mouth that the Jared/Flynn talk with Amb. Kislyak in the Trump Tower were wiretapped and he knew about the transcript of the talk. Now ELI5 how they had a transcript of the talk if they didn't wiretapped it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's pretty simple if you look at the details. The EU sanctions don't block Russian trade, they block individuals and their assets mainly, make access to financing from EU banks more difficult and the ONLY trade affected directly is high tech in deep sea drilling and oil/gas extracting technologies (which by default will reflect on the EU gas/oil delivery prices - I hope you can see the absurd here). Russia OTOH directly blocked trade imports from the EU and the US. That causes loss of jobs and mainly of market (as that could be irrecoverable even if relations are restored), it gives the Russian economy an impetus to diversify from its mainly raw materials export dependence, develop its own economy and create jobs. Also the EU sanctions literally have no effect even in the areas they target as seen - the Norway company which had the contract for providing deep sea drilling tech, and fell under the EU sanctions, just registered an offshore company that served as a shell and thus avoided the sanctions. So let the sanctions stay and Russia develop its economy and I believe in the current situation Russia is NOT a partner which will be denied financing from other banking institutions outside the EU. Plain as that. </TEXT>

Everyone is taking it in stride and  agree that even if sanctions against Russia are lifted the ones against the EU should remain as they are a push for the economy to diversify, seek better and cheaper alternatives and get self-sustainable as opposed to dependent on oil and oil products only.   </TEXT>

Let's not pretend - it was the US that set all the ME on fire - Iraq, Libya, Syria and it was their making to "fuck the EU" (as the other bitch AsstSoS Nuland declared openly) with the flood of immigrants which might as well bring the EU down. Same goes for the coup d'etat in Ukraine which brought the accession of Crimea to the RF and the war in Donbass. </TEXT>

Also economic hardships are not a reason to sparkle russophobia, such things exist worldwide, the US included (to be precise the % of ppl living under the poverty level is bigger in the US than in Russia, to say nothing about the poor members of the EU as Romania and Bulgaria or former USSR republics like Ukraine). </TEXT>

That means that the mfos in Kiev (whoever they are by that time) won't be able to sell the country's valuable assets for pennies and cash out the bribes for that kind of robbery i.e. this will prevent them from really running the country into the gutter and selling their own down the river. So basically Russia will have them by the balls and Ukraine will have just a geopolitical value void of economic such.

It's simple, indeed and you are plainly lying and here it is for the ones that upvoted you for telling a lie: 

# [Marine Le Pen was NOT found guilty inciting religious hatred before.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/15/marine-le-pen-not-guilty-inciting-religious-hatred-lyon-french-front-national) 

So, let's see how sweet undeserved karma works when juxtaposed to the truth and check if you will recuse and apologize for spreading lies?

She won't be found guilty this time either IMHO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's also important to point out that you are wrong and your statement is unsubstantiated. Metformin does increase the life expectancy of people suffering from metabolic syndrome morbidity, namely DM. It's also a fact that metformin's main mechanism is by induction of LKB1 AMPK where inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory capacity is an element through activation of (e)HIF-1a as a factor. AMPK is the main upstream anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory signaling path involved in longevity and all known ways of lifespan extension are downstream of it including inhibition of mTORC1 mentioned here. The claim presented in the study that "multiple lines of evidence indicate that AMPK is
dispensable for metformins beneficial effects (Foretz et al.,
2010; Griss et al., 2015; Kalender et al., 2010)" is a bit baffling and IMHO is a result of not well and completely understood mechanisms of AMPK induction as is the case with Compound C which was considered as an AMPK antagonist while research shows it acts as an agonist but I could be wrong here. Metformin is a drug and as a such has a prescription label use although it's widely used off-label. It's not something ppl buy OTC and gobble to extend their life yet. However your statement contradicts the scientific fundamentals of the model of action of metformin and the signalling paths involved which are also, I repeat, involved in longevity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> According SOHR, the one-man run info website in London which feeds on entirely radical Sunni/Wahhabi/Salafi aka "rebel" sources, the SAA has not taken part in the air-strikes and they have been lumped as Russian airstrikes. Total BS as info and credibility, same as the White Helmets aka the ISIS Red Crescent. The vast majority of the civilian casualties are caused by the SAA chopper airstrikes and attributed wrongfully to Russia for a reason. You see the real difference now? </TEXT>
