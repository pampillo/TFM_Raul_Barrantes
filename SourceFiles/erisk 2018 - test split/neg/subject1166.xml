<TITLE> [Advice] My coach insults us during practice and during events. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-24 03:24:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we have a new coach this year and she seems to be the opposite of anything good in this life. To start the season she picked who she liked and didn't and moved them to the "fast" lanes and had them swimming more events than the rest of us. I don't know exactly why but to top that off, she always says we need to be like them and during a set she decided we weren't doing good enough and called us all retarded and how we need to be like the "fast" lane. I have a problem with how she treats us and what brought me to my breaking point was on Saturday, I got invited to an invitational and she decided to put me in the 200yd free and just a little background, I am a breaststroker and sprinter only... and I HAVE NEVER SWAM THE 200!!! So after my event she comes up to me saying that i should've done better and she was mad at me for getting last. That's what threw me off the edge because I know I tried my best and for her to say that really upsets me... Should I confront her or just let it be since season is almost over with anyway?  </TEXT>
