<TEXT> Reddit is unique because of it numerous aspects. But one thing that I love about it is its anonymity and its community. 

But if in the foreseeable future people start promoting their profiles to make them look impressive, than there won't be any contribution to the actual discussion.

 Plus the activity feature for me is quite unsettling, because I don't want anyone to know what I'm doing on the sight...

<TEXT> Tunnel vision Mercy and kill her ASAP. Running into a duo like that a lone, would probably result in your death anyways. So trying to kill a pocketed 76 is not a bright idea. Because even if you actually kill him, the Mercy might rez, or even worse escape to her teammates and keeps them healed up. So this is how I think: Kill Mercy and die, and deny her from helping her team out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you know what you are talking about. By reading what u said you clearly aren't anywhere near masters or GM. In the entire T500 leaderboards there are literally less then five people that XIM4. And on top of that, it is quite unlikely they will all be playing at the same time. BTW the xim4 is really bad on console, because you cannot adjust in-game sensitivities like PC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can confirm as well. Pharahs are picked mist of the time. But I am a GM/T500 player. And up here Pharah gets countered fairly easily by just having a but of communication. Players up here also have got better aim the most (ofcourse) considering their rank. But I would suggest to get Mercy-Soldier to counter a Pharmacy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Seer did warn Bjorn that Ragnars arrival would bring chaos to Kattegat. Plus Ragnar visited Lagertha, talked to her and even kissed her whilst ignoring Aslaug the whole time. This indicates that Ragnar loves Lagertha. (Plus he wanted to see her before he 'dies', because he said that he'll travel to England to die. I also believe that Lagertha wants to kill Aslaug because she saw her performing some ritual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel the same way as you. But I still fucking love the show. In short: The show went from historic accuracy + action to having more freedom with changing historic events and adding a shit ton of drama </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do understand where you are coming from. But if you recall, in season 1, Ragnars intentions weren't to become famous, but instead to become rich and expand viking settlements. That is why during season 1 his main goal was to travel west and loot the lands. 

And I don't think referring to historical records would  be good in this case. Because after all in reality Rollo isn't Ragnar's brother. And Ragnar has over 10 children. The show has created many extra elements to the show to make it more entertaining. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although Ragnar started to 'doubt' his gods, I really do think that in the inside he still believes in them. Just like his brother Rollo, who converted to Christianity and now is a prince amongst them (Christians). But deep inside, he still believes in the Vikings. He even said to his wife (Gisla) that she would hear thunder but he still hear's the God Thor beating his hammer. 

I feel like there is a very strange connection between the two brothers. They seem to doubt their fate quite often, but they still believe in their viking gods, Valhalla.....in the inside.

And yes I actually do believe that Ragnar is blaming the Christian god on Athelstan's death. And that, in my opinion is why he ordered his son Ivar to seek revenge on Ecbert. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its just a hard type of shot to pull off when an enemy is not close to your crosshairs, but have to finish him off. (It kinda showcases the players skill) Btw they most efficient way it to flick once, then lock on. But some keep on flicking out of a habit. </TEXT>
