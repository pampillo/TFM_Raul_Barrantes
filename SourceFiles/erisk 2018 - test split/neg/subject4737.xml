Just before this passage, in verses 11-12, it says "If anyone among you has been rendered unclean by a nocturnal emission, he must leave the camp, and he must not reenter the camp. Toward evening he shall bathe in water, and at sundown he may reenter the camp." But, as I understand it, "nocturnal emission" is referring to a wet dream. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Uh except for the fact Aquinas actually was a proponent of the cosmological argument and has four or five reasons for it which TheCosmicSkeptic goes into detail about in his video.

Right, he was a proponent of the cosmological argument, but he **never** said "Everything has a cause, the universe is a thing, and therefore the universe should have a cause" as TheCosmicSkeptic quoted him.

I also dont see how this is supposed to convince me of the cosmological argument? Just because some author claims that no one else used it because its stupid?

No, the author isn't claiming that nobody used the cosmological argument because it was stupid: he is saying that there are gross misrepresentations of the cosmological argument which are put forward as straw men, and then knocked down, and that it's disingenuous to treat this as the "real" version, and then say that arguments as they were actually presented by major proponents as an attempt to patch the original up.

 Thomas Aquinas for one even though the author you quote claims he wasn't a proponent despite the fact he has five reasons, as presented in TheCosmicSkeptic's video as to why the prime mover of the universe was in his mind God.

Feser notes that the cosmological argument isn't intended to establish truths of revealed religion (that's point 5. in his blog post) nowhere does he say that Aquinas didn't argue for the attributes of God as part of his natural theology. Indeed, he says the exact opposite in point 4. of the blog post.

but to be atheist or theist then you have to have the ability to make observations that shape what you think about the world or universe.

Not if atheism is defined as "lacking a belief in theism".

I should note that TheCosmicSkeptic is only attacking the argument which many theists do actually use as a reason for their own Gods existence.

If he's just attacking "many theists", then why does he mention Aquinas and Craig? </TEXT>

<TEXT> . I highly recommend watching TheCosmicSkeptics videos on YouTube. He responds to a lot of said arguments.

Ok, I just watched his video on the Kalam cosmological argument:

He says at :33 "Everything has a cause, noted Aquinas. The universe is a thing, and therefore the universe should have a cause."

As Ed Feser writes in an excellent blog post called "So you think you understand the cosmological argument?", which I thoroughly recommend you read:

*"Lots of people  probably most people who have an opinion on the matter  think that the cosmological argument goes like this: Everything has a cause; so the universe has a cause; so God exists.  They then have no trouble at all poking holes in it.  If everything has a cause, then what caused God?  Why assume in the first place that everything has to have a cause?  Why assume the cause is God?  Etc.*

*Heres the funny thing, though.  People who attack this argument never tell you where they got it from.  They never quote anyone defending it.  Theres a reason for that.  The reason is that none of the best-known proponents of the cosmological argument in the history of philosophy and theology ever gave this stupid argument.  Not Plato, not Aristotle, not al-Ghazali, not Maimonides, not Aquinas, not Duns Scotus, not Leibniz, not Samuel Clarke, not Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, not Mortimer Adler, not William Lane Craig, not Richard Swinburne.  And not anyone else either, as far as I know.  (Your Pastor Bob doesnt count.  I mean no one among prominent philosophers.)  And yet it is constantly presented, not only by popular writers but even by some professional philosophers, as if it were the basic version of the cosmological argument, and as if every other version were essentially just a variation on it."*

He goes on to say at 2:36 "Even if the Kalam cosmological argument was sound, and I hope to prove that it's not, it still wouldn't prove any particular God".

If his argument here is "The Kalam cosmological argument doesn't establish the truths of any particular revealed religion (e.g. Jesus was God incarnate, Mohammed is the last seal of the prophets)", then that's not really a strike against it. Which major proponent of the argument ever claimed that it *did* establish such a thing? As for his question "why not multiple Gods?" and that the argument commits the fallacy of composition, you'll find that Craig has addressed these questions in his published work.

There are serious criticisms of natural theology, but teenage YouTube atheists are *not* the place to go to find them. J Howard Sobel and Graham Oppy are two qualified authors who are prominent in this area.

calling atheists shoes (an ad hominem to this day I still dont know why theists constantly use)

<TEXT> There is absolutely no way whatsoever that you can go from saying a God might exist using cosmological or teleological arguments, to then infer that if there is a God that God is a personal one

Well, Craig gives an arguments in his presentations of the Kalam and teleological arguments for certain properties of the designer. As far as I can see, all you've done is say the words "no proof!" rather than actually addressing them.

So, you are saying the ultimate being in all of existence, one in which they are saying has no beginning, will always exist, has all knowledge, and is all powerful is somehow a 'simple being'?

I certainly don't see why it's true "by definition" that God must be complex.

 The Cosmological Argument or First Cause Argument is a philosophical argument for the existence of God which explains that everything has a cause. That is the definition of the Kalam Cosmological argument, just so we are both on the same page.

No, we aren't "on the same page". As Ed Feser writes in that post I linked to earlier:

*Lots of people  probably most people who have an opinion on the matter  think that the cosmological argument goes like this: Everything has a cause; so the universe has a cause; so God exists.  They then have no trouble at all poking holes in it.  If everything has a cause, then what caused God?  Why assume in the first place that everything has to have a cause?  Why assume the cause is God?  Etc.*

*Heres the funny thing, though.  People who attack this argument never tell you where they got it from.  They never quote anyone defending it.  Theres a reason for that.  The reason is that none of the best-known proponents of the cosmological argument in the history of philosophy and theology ever gave this stupid argument.  Not Plato, not Aristotle, not al-Ghazali, not Maimonides, not Aquinas, not Duns Scotus, not Leibniz, not Samuel Clarke, not Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, not Mortimer Adler, not William Lane Craig, not Richard Swinburne.  And not anyone else either, as far as I know.  (Your Pastor Bob doesnt count.  I mean no one among prominent philosophers.)  And yet it is constantly presented, not only by popular writers but even by some professional philosophers, as if it were the basic version of the cosmological argument, and as if every other version were essentially just a variation on it.*

*Dont take my word for it.  The atheist Robin Le Poidevin, in his book Arguing for Atheism (which my critic Jason Rosenhouse thinks is pretty hot stuff) begins his critique of the cosmological argument by attacking a variation of the silly argument given above  though he admits that no-one has defended a cosmological argument of precisely this form!  So whats the point of attacking it?  Why not start instead with what some prominent defender of the cosmological argument has actually said?*

*Suppose some creationist began his attack on Darwinism by assuring his readers that the basic claim of the Darwinian account of human origins is that at some point in the distant past a monkey gave birth to a human baby.  Suppose he provided no source for this claim  which, of course, he couldnt have, because no Darwinian has ever said such a thing  and suppose also that he admitted that no one has ever said it.  But suppose further that he claimed that more sophisticated versions of Darwinism were really just modifications of this claim.  Intellectually speaking, this would be utterly contemptible and sleazy.  It would give readers the false impression that anything Darwinians have to say about human origins, however superficially sophisticated, is really just a desperate exercise in patching up a manifestly absurd position.  Precisely for that reason, though, such a procedure would, rhetorically speaking, be very effective indeed.*

If you want to believe with faith, do so. Don't pretend to have reason for it. Be proud of having faith despite there being no rational base for it; many believers seem to hold faith in higher regard the fewer reasons there are for having it. 

Given that you think the Kalam cosmological argument begins with the proposition "everything has a cause", you have a lot to learn and should drop this kind of rhetoric. For example, you can find the answer to your question "Noone has ever seen an actor cause something to come into existence from nothing. Ever." in Craig's lecture "Objections So Bad I Couldn't Have Made Them Up. The World's Ten Worst Objections To The Kalam Cosmological Argument". </TEXT>

<TEXT> To run with the example from forensic science, if somebody said "Yes, I recognise that the samples from the crime scene match my blood type and microsatellite markers, but how can you say that those samples deriving from me is the only plausible hypothesis? Isn't it possible that there was a thermodynamic fluctuation which assembled them from the sources of carbon, nitrogen etc. already at the crime scene?"

But this prompts the reply "Yes, that is a *possible* hypothesis, but not a plausible one".

Surely because eliminating hypotheses as implausible is part of the process of science, evidence against some hypothesis "a" will be support for another hypothesis "b" only in the case that a and b are known to be the only plausible hypotheses.

I'm a creationist, but I think I would disagree with the statement that "evidence against evolution is evidence for creation"? simply because both of those words have multiple senses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You would be left with the same probability that a giant pink unicorn is our God as the Christian God. 

Well, neither Craig, nor any other major defender of the teleological argument, claims that it is intended to establish the truth of doctrines peculiar to some particular revealed religion e.g. that Jesus is God incarnate, or Mohammed is the seal of all the prophets, etc.

So this really isn't a flaw in the argument, because that's not what it's intended to do! 

Craig writes elsewhere concerning the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which is often brought up in a similar manner to the way you used the giant pink unicorn:

*what is the point of the parody? What does it show? Its striking that Hendersons parody does nothing to call into question either the legitimacy or necessity of the inference to an Intelligent Designer of the universe. Rather the point of the parody seems to be that we cannot know much, if anything, about the nature of the Designer. Therefore, its arbitrary to characterize the Designer of the universe as God, especially the God of some specific religion.*

*Whats curious about this parody is that ID theorists like William Dembski have been insisting on this same point for years, but everyone seems to think them disingenuous. Dembski makes it abundantly clear that on the basis of the specified complexity in the universe one cannot infer that the Designer is infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and so forth. It is precisely for that reason that ID theorists deny that ID is disguised religion. The identification of the Designer with God is a theological conclusion that cannot itself be warranted on the basis of the design argument alone.*

*Dembski writes,*

*Insofar as design theorists do not bring up God, it is because design-theoretic reasoning does not warrant bringing up God. Design-theoretic reasoning tells us that certain patterns exhibited in nature reliably point to a designing intelligence. But theres no inferential chain that leads from such finite design-conducing patterns in nature to the infinite personal transcendent creator God of the worlds major theistic faiths. . . . As a Christian I hold that the Christian God is the ultimate source of design behind the universe. . . . But theres no way for design inferences from physics or biology to reach that conclusion. . . . Far from being coy or deceitful, when design theorists do not bring up God, it is because they are staying within the proper scope of their theory (The Design Revolution, p. 26).*

*Therefore, Dembski is adamant that religious interpretations of Intelligent Design should not be taught in public classrooms. Dembski himself, had he thought of it, might have appealed to the Flying Spaghetti Monster to illustrate his point! Ironically, then, Hendersons parody actually reinforces one of the central contentions of the ID movement, that it is not religious teaching. The inference to a Designer is not an inference to any particular deity.*

*This is not to say that we can infer nothing about the Designer of the universe on the basis of the specified complexity of the cosmos. Principally, what we can infer is that there exists a personal, and, hence, self-conscious, volitional being of inconceivably great intelligence who designed the universe. If people really believed that to be true, they would be wide-eyed and open-mouthed with astonishment, rather than mocking and derisive.*

*Moreover, its plausible that any ultimate explanation must involve a personal being which is incorporeal. For any being composed of material stuff will exhibit precisely that specified complexity that we are trying to explain. The old Who designed the Designer? objection thus presses hard against any construal of the Designer as a physical object (see my Richard Dawkins Argument for Atheism in The God Delusion in the Question of the Week Archive). That immediately rules out the Flying Spaghetti Monster as a final explanation.*


--------

Being we are talking about a being that is infinitely powerful, all-knowing, and some Christians claim, omnipresent, then it is by definition the most complex being possible to exist.

Why is that true "by definition"?

If that cause has no cause, then once again not everything has a cause.

Once again: "everything has a cause" is **not** a premise of the Kalam cosmological argument, so that's irrelevant. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Just because something is vestigial doesn't mean it has no function

Plenty of people *do* formulate these kinds of arguments in terms of the lack of function, though. E.g. Jerry Coyne in his book "Why Evolution Is True":

"One of my favorite cases of embryological evidence for evolution is the furry human fetus. We are famously known as naked apes because, unlike other primates, we dont have a thick coat of hair. But in fact for one brief period we do  as embryos. Around sixth months after conception, we become completely covered with a fine, downy coat of hair called lanugo. Lanugo is usually shed about a month before birth, when its replaced by the more sparsely distributed hair with which were born. (Premature infants, however, are sometimes born with lanugo, which soon falls off.) Now, theres **no need** for a human embryo to have a transitory coat of hair. After all, its a cozy 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the womb. Lanugo **can be explained only** as a remnant of our primate ancestry: fetal monkeys also develop a coat of hair at about the same stage of development." See [here](http://blog.drwile.com/?p=1309) for a debunking of this particular example, incidentally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you are doing is presenting a critique of the Kalam cosmological argument, in saying that Craig acknowledges "that at least some things can exist without a beginning."

Where did he ever deny this though? The first premise of the argument, as Craig formulates it, is "everything that begins to exist has a cause" **not** "everything that exists has a beginning". This idea that Craig is simply arbitrarily exempting God from some principle misunderstands the argument. I thoroughly recommend the following blog post: http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2011/07/so-you-think-you-understand.html

I don't want to sound rude, but this objection is irrelevant and you've displayed no evidence of having actually read his critique of Dawkins's argument, which may be found [here](http://www.reasonablefaith.org/dawkins-delusion).

<TEXT> Thanks for the effort you put in to your post.

My question is: by what principle do we infer this conclusion from this observation?

Well, that's sort of my question as well: I'm struggling to understand final causes within the Aristotelian framework, and how one is supposed to determine what the final cause of a particular entity is.

 if we could get clear about what this reason is, then we'd be in a position to assess whether this is an adequate account of Aristotle's position, and try to clarify the relevant issues if it is not. But I'm hesitant to try to guess at what this reason is, so I was hoping you could clarify the point.

Sorry if seems I'm trying to surreptitiously "gotcha" here: I'm genuinely interested in this topic, and this is not my intent. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Do you mean the final cause of snowshoe hares, on an Aristotelian account, is to produce such a cyclic oscillation of the population? If so, why would the Aristotelian say this?

Um, I'm not well-read enough on this topic, so I don't see what you're getting at with these questions. Why *wouldn't* the Aristotelian conclude that this cyclic oscillation was the final cause?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sci fi author, retired engineer, and lay Catholic Michael Flynn writes [as follows](http://tofspot.blogspot.com/2011/12/oh-happiness-our-beings-end-and-aim.html):

*William Wallace distinguishes three kinds of end:*

*1. Terminus. In traveling from "here" to "there," the "there" is the end of the trip, where the traveler comes to rest.  When such stability terminates a natural process, whether inorganic or organic, it is the end of the process and as such its final cause.*

*Falling motion terminates when the heavy object arrives at a center of gravity.*

*Fleas grow, but not to the point where they reach the size of elephants.*

*Chemical reactions "go," but they also "stop," for example, when hydrogen and oxygen combine to form a stable molecule in water.*

*The breakdown of uranium terminates at lead.*

*[TOF: Regular cyclic behavior counts as "at rest".  We would say "equilibrium state" in modern lingo.]*

My question concerns cyclic behaviour. Consider the example of the snowshoe hare population. Records of the number of pelts traded from the Hudson Bay Trading Company have revealed that snowshoe hare populations oscillate over a ~10 year cycle. 

See: https://www.math.duke.edu//education/ccp/materials/diffeq/predprey/pred1.html


Now, if you saw the data in the link above might you not conclude "the terminus of snowshoe hares is this cyclic oscillation of population"?

But say you visited Canada in 1880 without knowing of this wider phenomenon, and left after 5 years, concluding that snowshoe hare populations had suffered from some abnormal disaster, are steadily rising and will one day reach a plateau. I.e. the terminus of snowhoe hares is to maintain a steady population.

Couldn't a nominalist say: well, the fact that the latter person made an incorrect conclusion shows that all that's going on is fallible inductions about the combinations of matter that they come across in their daily lives, rather than any kind of genuine insight into a "nature" which these beings possess? </TEXT>

St John Chrysostom wrote, referring to Psalm 1, in his "Instructions to Catechumens"

*"As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.*

*And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old said, "You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."*

<TEXT> Just to give a few citations:

Saint Augustine (354-430 A.D.) discussed this question in his ["On The Literal Meaning of Genesis"](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_s0kIgD0nCcC pg=PA92 dq=augustine+%22why+brute+beasts+inflict+injury%22 hl=en sa=X ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI9bXo9_PwxwIVguimCh1UJwPn#v=onepage q=augustine%20%22why%20brute%20beasts%20inflict%20injury%22 f=false), suggesting that predation is part of creation's intrinsic design:

*"But one might ask why brute beasts inflict injury on one another, for there is no sin in them for which this could be a punishment, and they cannot acquire any virtue by such a trial. The answer, of course, is that one animal is the nourishment of another. To wish that it were otherwise would not be reasonable. For all creatures, as long as they exist, have their own measure, number, and order. Rightly considered, they are all praiseworthy and all the changes that occur in them, even when one passes into another, are governed by a hidden plan that rules the beauty of the world and regulates each according to its kind."*

St Basil of Caesarea, (~329-379) in his [9th Homily on the Six Days](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/32019.htm), gives the anatomy of predators as an example of God's creative power, and I think he can be taken as implying that carnivory is a necessary aspect of these creature's lives:

*"If you examine the members even of animals, you will find that the Creator has given them nothing superfluous, that He has omitted nothing that is necessary. To carnivorous animals He has given pointed teeth which their nature requires for their support. Those that are only half furnished with teeth have received several distinct receptacles for their food."*

St Thomas Aquinas, (1225-1274) certainly no theological scrub, seems to have taken a similar view in his [Summa Theologica](http://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/FP/FP096.html#FPQ96A1THEP1):

*"In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others, would, in that state* [i.e. prior to the Fall] *, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the nature of animals was not changed by man's sin, as if those whose nature now it is to devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and falcon. Nor does Bede's gloss on Gn. 1:30, say that trees and herbs were given as food to all animals and birds, but to some. Thus there would have been a natural antipathy between some animals."*

So it seems that there were a number of prominent theologians who took the view that carnivory was initially present in creation, prior to the Fall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Historian of physics Helge Kragh, in his article "What's in a Name: History and Meanings of the Term Big Bang"  writes:

*It is possible that Gamow felt Hoyles big bang to be a pejorative phrase, but there is no documentation that either Gamow, Lematre or other protagonists of explosion cosmologies at the time felt offended by the term  or that they paid
attention to it at all. In any case, with the later success of the big bang theory it
became common to see Hoyles neologism as an attempt to make the idea of an
explosion universe, and Gamows version of it in particular, sound ridiculous. This is
not how Hoyle saw it. At the time he seems to have considered it just an apt but
innocent phrase for a theory he was opposed to, and he later insisted that he had not
thought of it in a derogatory sense. In an interview of 1989, Alan Lightman asked
him if he was really the source of the name. Hoyle answered 
"Well, I dont know whether thats correct, but nobody has challenged it, and I would
have thought that if it were incorrect somebody would have said so. I was constantly
striving over the radio  where I had no visual aids, nothing except the spoken word 
for visual images. And that seemed to be one way of distinguishing between the
steady-state and the explosive big bang. And so that was the language I used."*

*As a broadcaster Hoyle needed word pictures to get over technical and conceptual points, and big bang was one of them. When he had to explain the expansion of the
universe, he made extensive use of the inflating-balloon image that had first been introduced by Eddington in 1931 to illustrate a positively curved space with
increasing radius. Likewise, to illustrate the slow rate of matter creation in the
steady state theory, Hoyle appealed to pictures familiar to all Britons. In his first BBC
broadcast he explained that it would take about one billion years until a new atom
was created in a volume equal to a pint of milk bottle. And the
next year he said about the creation rate that it was no more than the creation of one
atom in the course of about a year in a volume equal to St. Pauls Cathedral
The standard view, to be found in numerous books and articles, is the one
reported in a popular book by Nobel laureate astrophysicist George Smoot and his
coauthor Keay Davidson. Hoyle had meant the term [big bang] to be derogatory,
they say, but it was so compelling, so stirring of the imagination, that it stuck, but
without the negative overtones. As we shall see, it
took twenty years until the term was seen as compelling and stirring of the
imagination.*

<TEXT> On the subject of passagio, it's not really the ability to transition between notes per se.

There's a bit of mixed opinion among singers about different registers, but passagio refers to where the voice starts to shift into what's commonly called falsetto. For classical tenors, on challenge is being able to simultaneously prevent shifting into falsetto, and avoiding an "open" sound through the passagio and above. [See here for a brief demo of the "open" vs "covered" sound](https://youtu.be/uo6dDQiBGyI?t=44). For tenors, our passagio usually sits around E to F#. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going OK, thanks. I'm not the best student, but funnily enough my best marks have been in the Evolution and Genetics units I've taken so far (76 and 82, from memory).

In terms of how it has influenced my views, one thing that comes to mind is that even at an undergraduate level, when you learn, you really start to learn how much you don't know. I guess I'm talking about getting a sense of the sheer scope of biology and just how deeply different issues can potentially be explored. 

I mean, to take an example that you would be readily familiar with, let's compare the incredible depth of learning and attention to detail that somebody like Joseph Felsenstein brings to bear in his comments on these issues, to Richard Dawkins' ["Behe is a fraud 'cos wolves change heaps"](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4rs07n/medicine_validates_evolutionary_mechanisms/d5fqt5o/) in his NYT review of TEoE. And you'll still see people citing the latter as some kind of "knock-down" refutation.

To be sure: this happens on all sides of the debate, there are only so many hours in the day, and I'm certainly guilty of not following up things myself. I guess as my learning grows in the future, I hope to bring a greater *depth* of analysis (Proverbs 25:2) to particular issues, rather than being a "generalist".  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-03-31 05:52:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Seminarian: No.

Historian: I thought not. It's not a story the Monks would tell you. He's a heretical legend. Pelagius was an ascetic, so powerful in speech, wise and harsh in his practice. He could even use his methods to rid anyone of their passions... bringing about spiritual life. He had such knowledge of the holy life, he even taught that all men naturally had the grace in them to keep themselves from spiritually... dying.

Seminarian: He had a doctrine that taught people could actually... save themselves from spiritual death without God's grace?

Historian: The dark side of Church history is a pathway to many 
doctrines some consider to be unorthodox.

Seminarian: What happened to him?

Historian: He became so influential, that eventually he was condemned for lying about his true doctrines in order not to lose his power... which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, Augustine knew everything he taught. Then condemned by the Council of Orange, his career was put to sleep. Ironic. His assumptions are unknowingly hailed in some traditions... but not he himself.

Seminarian: Is it possible to learn this doctrine?

Historian: Not from the orthodox. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you not heard of that pupper who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the kennels, and borked incessantly: "I seek the Master! I seek the Master!" -- As many of those who did not believe in the Master were lying around just then, he provoked v many laffs. "ha ha has he got lost, fren"? asked one. "Did he lose his way like a baby pupperino"? asked another. "Or is he doing a hide ? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated?" -- Thus they borked and laffed.

The pupper jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. "Whither is the Master?" he cried; "I will tell you. We have killed him -- you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Are we not being done a frighten? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying the Master? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Master, too, decompose.

The Master is dead.

The Master remains dead.

And we have killed him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We conclude that the most likely explanation was changes in cultivated varieties used today compared to 50 years ago, [lead author Donald] Davis said. During those 50 years, there have been intensive efforts to breed new varieties that have greater yield, or resistance to pests, or adaptability to different climates. But the dominant effort is for higher yields. Emerging evidence suggests that when you select for yield, crops grow bigger and faster, but they dont necessarily have the ability to make or uptake nutrients at the same, faster rate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It's an exclusively Protestant doctrine.

With regards to substitution, surely there are plenty of pre-Reformation thinkers who believed that Jesus, in the place of us, took the covenantal curse of death upon Himself as part of his mission. 

E.g. St Hilary of Poitier, in his Homily on Psalm 53:

*"It was from this curse that our Lord Jesus Christ redeemed us, when, as the Apostle says: Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made curse for us, for it is written: cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree* [Gal. 3:13]. *Thus He offered Himself to the death of the accursed that He might break the curse of the Law, offering Himself voluntarily a victim to God the Father, in order that by means of a voluntary victim the curse which attended the discontinuance of the regular victim might be removed."*

St John Chrysostom, in his Homilies on Second Corinthians: 

*"If one that was himself a king, beholding a robber and malefactor under punishment, gave his well-beloved son, his only-begotten and true, to be slain;and transferred the death and the guilt as well, from him to his son (who was himself of no such character), that he might both save the condemned man and clear him from his evil reputation; and then if, having subsequently promoted him to great dignity, he had yet, after thus saving him and advancing him to that glory unspeakable, been outraged by the person that had received such treatment: would not that man, if he had any sense, have chosen ten thousand deaths rather than appear guilty of so great ingratitude? This then let us also now consider with ourselves, and groan bitterly for the provocations we have offered our Benefactor; nor let us therefore presume, because though outraged he bears it with long-suffering; but rather for this very reason be full of remorse."*

Or St Augustine of Hippo, in his work "Against Faustus":

*"If we read, Cursed of God is every one that hangeth on a tree,* [Gal. 3:13; cf.Deut 21:23] *the addition of the words of God creates no difficulty. For had not God hated sin and our death, He would not have sent His Son to bear and to abolish it. And there is nothing strange in Gods cursing what He hates. For His readiness to give us the immortality which will be had at the coming of Christ, is in proportion to the compassion with which He hated our death when it hung on the cross at the death of Christ. And if Moses curses every one that hangeth on a tree, it is certainly not because he did not foresee that righteous men would be crucified, but rather because He foresaw that heretics would deny the death of the Lord to be real, and would try to disprove the application of this curse to Christ, in order that they might disprove the reality of His death. For if Christs death was not real, nothing cursed hung on the cross when He was crucified, for the crucifixion cannot have been real. Moses cries from the distant past to these heretics: Your evasion in denying the reality of the death of Christ is useless. Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree; not this one or that, but absolutely every one. What! the Son of God? Yes, assuredly. This is the very thing you object to, and that you are so anxious to evade. You will not allow that He was cursed for us, because you will not allow that He died for us. Exemption from Adams curse implies exemption from his death. But as Christ endured death as man, and for man; so also, Son of God as He was, ever living in His own righteousness, but dying for our offences, He submitted as man, and for man, to bear the curse which accompanies death."*

From my admittedly limited reading of this topic, I've heard people emphasise that the Fathers are talking about a substitution in terms of death, rather than the imputation of sins, and that the latter *is* a later development. What are your thoughts, mr literarum?

That Christ genuinely suffered was one of the **earliest** issues that the post-Apostolic Fathers dealt with.

See, for example, St Ignatius of Antioch's Letter to the Trallians.

<TEXT> Have you not heard of that pupper who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the kennels, and borked incessantly: "I seek the Master! I seek the Master!" -- As many of those who did not believe in the Master were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter. "ha ha has he got lost, fren"? asked one. "Did he lose his way like a baby pupperino"? asked another. "Or is he doing a hide ? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated?" -- Thus they yelled and laughed.

The pup jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. "Whither is the Master?" he cried; "I will tell you. We have killed him -- you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Are we not being done a frighten? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying the Master? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Master, too, decompose. 

The Master is dead. 

The Master remains dead.

 And we have killed him. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That somehow it okay to repress a minority because "I just don't like them." 

Of course, if it *were* true that this a case of "repressing a minority" out of personal animus then there would be no debate.

Imagine, for a moment, that you are a proponent of lowering some particular tax, because you think that it unfairly targets people who are financially struggling, and your opponent said "There might be an argument if you were doing anything other than taking this position out of your own self-interest, but as it is there is no debate, frankly. Sorry, thanks for playing." 

Surely your response would be something like "That's [fallacious rhetoric](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/petitio+principii) which mindlessly dismisses debate, rather than seeks to actually establish a case".

We know how the story goes.

If "the story" is something like *"what is widely considered by "progressive" thinkers in Western culture to be necessary social reform is always right"* then I don't think you've got some infallible beacon here: consider, as just one example, the case of eugenics, which had massive support among early 20th century intelligentsia, who pilloried the opposition (largely made up of those evil reactionary Christians) as being hopelessly behind the times, standing in the way of civilisation's progress and so on. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They did what all anti-equality campaigners do, which is to frame obvious equality as a "debate" with "sides". 

Saying "this just isn't a debate because I *KNOW* I'm right" is not an intellectually rigorous mode of belief formation you've got going there: if you refuse to admit the possibility of error, then you will never know if you are wrong or not.

<TEXT> While I'm much more conservative in my views, I think I agree, and I think it needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

I mean, the fact that Abraham is described in Genesis 14 as travelling to Dan to rescue Lot is a classic example. Strictly speaking, Abraham couldn't have gone to  "Dan" because "Dan" (being named after the tribe of Dan settling there after the Exodus) didn't exist at the time under that name. In this case, I don't think it's a question of "error" or "bias": the author has clearly just renamed it to its "modern" name for the benefit of readers, and surely only a very wooden form of inerrancy would feel challenged by that.

<TEXT> My last post on here was a report on a very [unpleasant experience.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/4vmse9/just_had_an_awful_audition_any_advice/)

I'm pleased to say that I had a much better experience last night. It was my teacher's end of year concert, and I sang ["The Song of the Indian Guest"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7KXsVfopUs) from Rimsky-Korsakov's *Sadko*. 

While, of course, there is still plenty of room for improvement in my singing, being able to manage my nerves was very encouraging. I even managed the high G at the end!

In the days and hours before the concert, I was doing a fair bit of visualisation, to try to ensure that it wasn't such an "unexpected" experience. I would thoroughly recommend this.

If you've had trouble with your nerves that's really gotten you down, don't give up! Keep at it! </TEXT>

<TITLE> A brief report on a evangelistic conversation I had with a friend today </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-17 08:53:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> He's a skeptic, has been friends with me for about 8 years, was baptised Catholic but went to state schools and was never catechised as far as I know.

A lot of topics were covered, and here's a few things I can remember:

Was Christianity originally just a scam for power/money? He took the position that "We can't really know either way because there is not enough historical evidence" so that wasn't a fruitful line of conversation.

He also said that he sees that Christianity "fills a hole" for some people, but he really doesn't see that anything is lacking in his life. I was reminded of this [classic Internet Monk article](http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/a-god-shaped-void-maybe-not). 

One of the most interesting part was how the conversation closed:

He said "You know how to convince people? You *believe* in the thing you are arguing for, but you don't *care* about it."

To which I responded, "What if you think it's something you think is worth caring about?"

To which he said "Ah, but you shouldn't really *care* about anything."

Was this just banter? Part of the idea that floats around in popular culture that its fashionable and "unpretentious" to not care about things? This was an interesting stance to take, and I think I'll try to ask him more about what he meant by that next time. 

The most frustrating thing was that, as /u/australiancatholic can attest, verbal conversations on deep matters with me are often punctuated with huge pauses in which I struggle to find my words and sometimes have to give up. And today was no exception.

Please pray that I prepare myself, both intellectually and in prayer, for my next encounter of this kind with this person.

Feel free to ask questions or give suggestions in the comments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Chorus:** Famine tracks us down the lanes,

Hunger holds our horses reins,

Winter heaps the roads with snow;

O we have far to go!

Starving beggars howl their cry,

Snarl to see us spurring by,

Times are bad and travel slow;

O we have far to go!

We mourn our boys, our missing sons!

We sorrow for three little ones!

Timothy, Mark and John are gone!

Landlord, take this piece of gold!

Bring us food before the cold

Makes our pangs of hunger grow;

O we have far to go!

Day by day we seek to find

Some trace of them, but oh! Unkind!

Timothy, Mark and John are gone!

Let us share this dish of meat.

Come, my friends, sit down and eat!

Join us, Bishop, for we know

That you have far to go!

Mary meek and Mother mild

Who lost thy Jesus as a child,

Our Timothy, Mark and John are gone!

Come, your Grace, dont eat so slow!

Take some meat 

**Nicolas:** O do not taste! O do not feed on sin!

But haste to save three souls in need!

The mothers cry is sad and weak,

Within these walls they lie

Whom mothers sadly seek 

Timothy, Mark and John,

Put your fleshly garments on!

Come from dark oblivion! Come!

**Chorus:** See! Three boys spring back to life,

Who, slaughtered by the butchers knife,

Lay salted down!

And entering, hand in hand they stand and sing

Alleluia to their King! </TEXT>

<TEXT> As /u/bobzor mentioned, some have proposed that the homochirality of biochemistry is a result of the amplification of underlying physical inequalities. In 2008, [Rosenberg et al.](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.178301) gave one example of electron chirality being translated into a chiral effect at the chemical level, but whether the effect is large enough to form a possible mechanism remains controversial.

I believe that there is also evidence that different geometrical isomers of this kind are not always thermodynamically identical, but I don't know enough about physics to go into the details. See this review by physical chemist Martin Quack for more:

<TEXT> We conclude that the most likely explanation was changes in cultivated varieties used today compared to 50 years ago, [lead author Donald] Davis said. During those 50 years, there have been intensive efforts to breed new varieties that have greater yield, or resistance to pests, or adaptability to different climates. But the dominant effort is for higher yields. Emerging evidence suggests that when you select for yield, crops grow bigger and faster, but they dont necessarily have the ability to make or uptake nutrients at the same, faster rate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Virgin birth, resurrection, healing the blind, Jonah surviving inside of a "giant fish" for 3 days, Noah's ark, Adam and Eve, the world created in 6 days - all 

With things like the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, and Jesus's miraculous healings, I think Sir George Gabriel Stokes is helpful: 

*"Now we know very well that a man may in general act uniformly according to a certain rule, and yet for a special reason may on a particular occasion act quite differently. We cannot refuse to admit the possibility of something analogous taking place as regards the action of the Supreme Being. If we think of the laws of nature as self-existent and uncaused, then we cannot admit any deviation from them. But if we think of them as designed by a Supreme Will, then we must allow the possibility of their being on some particular occasion suspended."*

Now, if this is the case then why is Sidney Miller's [classic cartoon](http://www.readingreality.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sidney-Harris-Miracle.jpg) still funny?

I think the answer here is that it's very easy to see how a miracle can be a contrived or abitrary explanation. However, this is not the same thing as to say that miracles are *intrinsically incompatible* with science. </TEXT>

Yes, and people often commit grave evils and it actually *is* their fault, too.

<TEXT> Firstly, hell has traditionally been taken to primarily consist of the lack of the vision of God, an end which is utterly disproportionate to our natural state, and which requires God's grace dwelling in us to attain.

So I don't think that it's the case that God just arbitrarily wills for a person who stubbornly refuses to worship God to go to a place called hell, even though they would have otherwise inherited eternal life: it's that it's literally impossible for anybody to inherit eternal life, having cast out God's grace from their heart.

Secondly, any other penalties that are experienced in hell would be proportional to one's sins, so I don't think God can be faulted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Christopher Hitchens once said, along the same lines as your objection

*I used to wonder when I was a kid, what would it be like praising God and thanking him all day and all night? Well, now I know because North Korea is a completely worshipful state. It's set up only to do that, for adoration and its only one short of a trinity. They have a father and the son, as you know, the Dear Leader and the Great Leader."*

He goes on to ask Who would really want this?

I think we can unpack this objection by asking: why is the self-aggrandisement of the North Korean leaders so bad, anyway?

Let me submit that it is because there is an incongruency between the way they are presented and the way they really are:

To ascribe to Kim Jong Il that, for example, he is the true source of all good things in North Korea seems wrong because it is ultimately, an untruth: he is but a sinful fellow creature.

That is, it's so absurd precisely because he is **not God.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> In this context, the word "mutation" refer to a change in the sequence of nucleotide bases which composes an organism's genome.

Biologists speak of mutations being "random" and by this, it is not meant that every base has an equal probability of 
mutation: rather it refers to the probability of a mutation occuring at any given base not being affected by whether the mutation will confer selective advantage or disadvantage in its current environment.

"Selection" refers to sequences which confer a selective advantage increasing in frequency in a population. For example, a mutation which confers a resistance to an antibiotic will increase in frequency in a population of bacteria exposed to an antibiotic. That is, those individuals which possess the trait will be "selected" by the set of environmental conditions.

Another type of selection which operates is "kin selection". Consider a sequence which confers the trait "help closely related individuals". By the fact that closely related individuals are more likely to carry the altruism-promoting sequence, that sequence is able to increase in frequency in a population.

As far as I am aware, it remains controversial among  biologists whether selection operates on higher levels (e.g. group or species selection) </TEXT>

<TEXT>   they are all post facto. Of course rocks are found in layers. Of course genes are similar in different organisms

On the topic of post facto predictions, I agree that predictions which are "risky" and made before the fact are certainly *more* valuable, but to make predictions in the sense of being able to point out how your theory might explain certain observations after they have been observed is also valuable too in science, isn't it?

For example, Ernst Mayr claimed in 1963 that,

*"Much that has been learned about gene physiology makes it evident that the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives."*

However, as molecular biology progressed in the 20th century, it then became apparent that this search was manifestly *not futile*.

Surely you would agree that it's not fair to say "Mayr got it wrong, therefore this is a "failed prediction of evolution" because there are at least two possible stances one could take on this as a proponent of evolution:

1. Evolution happened, and works in a manner such that sequence similarity is unlikely between two organisms which aren't very closely related

<TEXT> One can't define something into existence.

I agree, and I'm not trying to do that. What I'm trying to do is to address an objection which purports to show the incoherence of Christianity. 

In Scripture, humans are exhorted to worship God.

Some claim that any being which exhorted humans to worship Him would be unworthy of worship, and thus Christianity is incoherent.

I fully acknowledge that, if I have addressed this objection, then that doesn't prove that God exists: all it does is address a potential objection to Christianity.

How is this "trying to define God into existence"? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you that any "God" which had some internal **need** for worship stemming from emotional insecurity would indeed be imperfect, and thus unworthy of worship . Let me suggest two other reasons why humans are exhorted to worship God:

1. To glorify God.

2. By God's grace, when we persevere and worship Him, we are sowing seeds that will be reaped in eternity. It is fitting for us and to our own benefit that we worship God. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems to me that this objection stems from looking at something like the self-aggrandisement of the North Korean leaders, which seems so incongruous, and then saying "Why isn't it just a bigger version of that?"

I think that this incongruency arises because there is a disconnect between the way these people are presented and the way they really are:

To ascribe to Kim Jong Il that, for example, he is the true source of all good things in North Korea seems wrong because it is ultimately, an untruth: he is but a sinful fellow creature.

That is, it's so absurd precisely because worship is only due to God and they are not God. </TEXT>

<TEXT> selling land (Lev 25:23

The land that is being prohibited from being sold there is the land of Israel, and the intent of that passage is clearly that Israel, having being rescued from destruction in Egypt and given that land by God, was to dwell in that region to fulfill His covenant purposes. It was not some blanket ban on anybody selling land, ever. 

This isn't some fundamentalist dodge: I can guarantee that this would be the answer that you would get from any mainstream biblical scholar, whether they be Christian, Jewish, irreligious or otherwise.

I implore you to consider that this topic might be worth investigating in further detail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a frequent occurence on a forum like reddit, to see somebody pipe up saying something like "Hi, expert here. I went to Catholic school for [x] years and I know it's all bunk." and then they will go on to give some woeful objection. 

To be sure, there are more challenging critics out there, but plenty of irreligious Westerners (especially in Europe and Australia, in my view) seem to have an overinflated sense of their "exposure" to Christian thought. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   the result is obvious.

I realise that "nobody could possibly be anything but irreligious unless they were indoctrinated in childhood" is one of those tropes that educated Westerners are now expected to nod sagely at, but it really seems to be more like a mantra which has seeped through popular culture than anything. Frankly, it always seems to be accompanied by "nobody could believe in [crude uninformed parody] unless they were indoctrinated as a child." </TEXT>

<TEXT> A major road was closed for a running race, and it was closed for longer than expected, so many in the congregation were late or absent. Unfortunately, this included the organist booked for the day. I was all set to cantor the Communion setting, and play a piece on trumpet during communion, but this wasn't possible. We switch to a Communion setting that is entirely congregational. We sang the first couple of hymns a cappella, with somebody starting us off with a note from a piano app on their phone. Thankfully, another organist turned up halfway through the service, but it was still frustrating.

Nevertheless, God was honored through our worship and the Eucharist was celebrated.

Our last hymn was "He Who Would Valiant Be" which is the only hymn I know of to include a reference to hobgoblins.

An interesting thing: three boys (aged 8-12 or so) turned up at church. They were from local public housing, and were unaccompanied by adult guardians. I think they had been hanging around the church's grounds on Saturday, and our Youth Minister had said that they were welcome to come to Sunday School. 

Our rector and youth minister went off elsewhere in the afternoon so I was sitting in the parish office by myself, and these three young fellows, who had decided to hang around the church grounds, turned up. I made them a cup of tea, and tried to make a bit of conversation. 

It will be interesting to see whether they return.

In the evening, our choir performed the Faure Requiem in its liturgical setting, which went well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We do see it as worthwhile by definition, because life forms that don't act out of self interest (in a broad sense and on various levels: the gene, the organism, the group, the species,...) will disappear off the face of the earth. It's a biological mechanism.

Let's take the case of a rock with a smiley face painted on. When a person says "it's cruel to heat that rock" we reply to them "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked by the smiley face into thinking that the rock is qualitatively different from other physical systems."

What I'm trying to get at is that, when a naturalist thinks that they have encountered a genuine instance of empathy (i.e. one with a real human, not a rock with a disguise) which provides a justification for treating them differently to an inanimate object, naturalism inescapably leads to the conclusion: "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked into thinking that the human being is qualitatively different from other physical systems which it is clearly **not** cruel to treat in this way (blocks of marble, clouds of helium gas, pools of tar, and so on).

As prominent philosopher of biology Michael Ruse put it: *"If everyone recognized the illusory nature of morality (and could escape from their biology sufficiently to take advantage of this recognition), then very soon people would start to cheat and the whole social system would collapse. Altruism would go and with it would go altruism. Hence, our biology leads us to objectify morality. Ethical skepticism may be the correct philosophy; but our genes are working flat out to make such a conclusion counter-intuitive.*"

To extend the analogy, imagine you asked the person "What is your intellectual justification for saying "don't be
cruel to this rock"? Surely you could see how if they answered "It's so glaringly obvious: I experience a feeling of empathy toward it, and I think that this feeling arises in me because of the evolutionary history of my ancestors"", all they have done is **described** certain experiences they have: they
haven't actually provided any justification. </TEXT>

As to pointing that there are people, or societies who don't rape and murder, and who aren't religious, this misses the point of the argument.

Person 1: Belief A and  behaviour B are intellectually inconsistent

Person 2: Thats not true at all: I met a man who says that he believes in A and I saw him do B just the other day.

Person 2 hasn't demonstrated the intellectual consistency of A and B by pointing out this example. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for elaborating.

Let me point out that you initially claimed that *"In the debate against Carroll, for instance, he opens with "Everything that begins to exist requires a cause", which he then clearly uses as a stepping stone for a Kalam type argument. But then, no, suddenly when cornered by Carroll's deconstruction of Craig's Kalam, it turns out Craig meant it was actually to be interpreted a la Leibniz."*

You now say that you were thinking of his debate with Krauss, but, contrary to what you said here, Craig does not, as you said, start out his debate with Krauss by discussing the premise "everything that begins to exist has a cause" and then redirecting to the Leibnizian argument when he has been addressed on the former front: it's Leibnizian from the very start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Augustine differs in that he didn't make the sharp distinction of the works of believers being part of sanctification as opposed to justification, like many Reformed thinkers do. In chapter 18 of his book Grace and Free Will he writes:

*Unintelligent persons, however, with regard to the apostle's statement: We conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law, Romans 3:28 have thought him to mean that faith suffices to a man, even if he lead a bad life, and has no good works. Impossible is it that such a character should be deemed a vessel of election by the apostle, who, after declaring that in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, Galatians 5:6 adds at once, but faith which works by love.*

In the same work he goes on to ask *If eternal life is rendered to good works, as the Scripture most openly declares: "Then He shall reward every man according to his works" Matthew 16:27, how can eternal life be a matter of grace, seeing that grace is not rendered to works, but is given gratuitously, as the apostle himself tells us: "To him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt" Romans 4:4, and again: "There is a remnant saved according to the election of grace" with these words immediately subjoined: "And if of grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace?" Romans 11:5-6 How, then, is eternal life by grace, when it is received from works?"*

But then he doesn't go on to say "these passages are to be harmonised in the following way: Christ was rewarded for His works, and we have His works imputed to us in justification", as many Reformed thinkers would.

Rather, he goes on to argue that these passages are to be harmonised in that *"those good works of ours, which are recompensed with eternal life, belong to the grace of God,".* </TEXT>

Surely you would agree that people experiencing empathy and an instinct for self-preservation might be the kind of thing we'd expect to see in a world in which nihilism is true?

If so, then you can't take the fact that people experience empathy and an instinct for self-preservation as evidence for the claim that nihilism is false (i.e. that the fact that these experiences exist "generates morality").  </TEXT>

No serious Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Muslim or Jewish theologian believes that God, in His divine nature, is spatially located in the sky and possesses a beard. This kind of rhetoric is upvoted because this sub has a fairly large crossover with reddit's atheist community, but this really is low-quality.

 because I feel terrible when I do hurt another, and because I understand that such behavior is destructive, not only to others but myself.

A short but beautiful reading which serves to remind us that the ultimate end is not merely the continuation of the finite good things of this life forever, but union with God.

For All The Saints and Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones were the hymns I remembered.

*"As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.*

*And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old said, "You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."*

<TEXT> [The Liah Pootah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lia_Pootah) are a group separate to the mainstream Aboriginal community, which may be who you are thinking of. However, I don't think that they make the claim that they are 100% Tasmanian Aboriginal.

In 1830, all the 160 known surviving Tasmanian Aborigines were taken to [Flinders Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island), which may be what you were thinking of. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  an emerging academic consensus over the past couple of decades that the Israelite God indeed commanded firstborn child sacrifice from Israelites,

Well, I'm certainly aware of it, but beyond the level of something like refuting the EvilBible.com proof-texting of Exodus 13:2, I guess I don't really have the time or learning to fully address it. But based on my past experience, lemme just say that, it seems like if there's a *possible* trace of disunity in Scripture then critical scholars are too quick to treat that as a *probable* case of disunity  ;)

<TEXT> The remark about a lack of wooden legs at Lourdes by French skeptic Anatole France's friend is often quoted in isolation, but here's the full version of what France actually wrote:

*Happening to be at Lourdes, in August, I paid a visit to the grotto where innumerable crutches were hung up in token of a cure. My companion pointed to these trophies of the sick-room and hospital ward, and whispered in my ear:*

*One wooden leg would be more to the point.*

*It was the word of a man of sense; but speaking philosophically, the wooden leg would be no whit more convincing than a crutch. If an observer of a genuinely scientific spirit were called upon to verify that a mans leg, after amputation, had suddenly grown again as before, whether in a miraculous pool or anywhere else, he would not cry: Lo! a miracle. He would say this:*

*An observation, so far unique, points us to a presumption that under conditions still undetermined, the tissues of a human leg have the property of reorganizing themselves like a crabs or lobsters claws and a lizards tail, but much more rapidly. Here we have a fact of nature in apparent contradiction with several other facts of the like sort. The contradiction arises from our ignorance, and clearly shows that the science of animal physiology must be reconstituted, or to speak more accurately, that it has never yet been properly constituted. It is little more than two hundred years since we first had any true conception of the circulation of the blood. It is barely a century since we learned what is implied in the act of breathing.*

*I admit it would need some boldness to speak in this strain. But the man of science should be above surprise. At the same time, let us hasten to add, none of them have ever been put to such a proof, and nothing leads us to apprehend any such prodigy. Such miraculous cures as the doctors have been able to verify to their satisfaction are all quite in accordance with physiology. So far the tombs of the Saints, the magic springs and sacred grottoes, have never proved efficient except in the case of patients suffering from complaints either curable or susceptible of instantaneous relief. But were a dead man revived before our eyes, no miracle would be proved, unless we knew what life is and death is, and that we shall never know.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> We know this with a high degree of confidence because the Tower of Babel was specifically constructed with brick-and-mortar to withstand another such flood, which means the flood needed to be small enough that an ancient brick-and-mortar tower on a high hill would be able to withstand it:

Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon states that the Tower was destroyed by wind, and Sanhedrin 109a states that one-third of the Tower of Babel was burnt by fire.

I have a problem with the official account of events, though: wind can't melt clay-brick towers. And what about the 4000 Shemites who were told not to go into work that day? Just a few honest questions from an open mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And, at the First Pentecost, 3000 are put to death for idolatry. (Exodus 32:28)

At the Greater Pentecost, 3000 are baptised. (Acts 2:41)

St John Chrysostom wrote in his "Instructions to Catechumens":

*"As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.*

*And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old said, "You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."*

<TEXT>  There is not one shred of physical or logical evidence for the existence of any deity.

If you are interested in pursuing this topic, I recommend the [following video to begin with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAIHs5TJRqQ).

Really? Are you sure it's not Odin?

If you have a look at that video, you might get a sense for why the arguments of classical natural theology do not lead to an entity with the properties that I would think that Odin or Zeus would have.

This is a nonsensical statement, and I don't think you understand what the words mean when you type them.

Not at all. [See this Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry for more, if you are genuinely interested in pursuing this topic](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentals-medieval/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, this statement is flawed in that it presumes that all replication will be 100% perfect. Obviously it is not. The fact of evolution requires that.

This premise doesn't presume that there will be a 100% accurate replication: it presumes that mutations will have a more deleterious effect on early developmental stages than later ones. Read the quote by Miller and Levine.

 Yeah, no shit. Organisms of different species are different. What a giant fucking shock. 

And, as the citations in the original post note, evolutionary theory predicts that early development *should be conserved*, and so then the question becomes whether the observed deviations in early development are sufficient to falsify that prediction.

Whatever, I don't even know why I'm bothering talking to you, your imaginary friend will just tell you that everyone is lying for ... reasons. Probably satan or something.

Cool your jets. I'm perfectly happy to engage you. </TEXT>

The phrasing of the issue as "fighting against equality" presupposes precisely what is in question, though:

If the pro-same sex marriage side are correct that marriage is between two people, then the law ought to be changed to reflect that ethical reality.

If the other side are correct that marriage is objectively between a man and a woman, then nobody is "fighting against equality" when they seek for that to ethical truth be upheld in the law.

<TEXT> To briefly introduce this piece, Burke and Wills were two Australian explorers who mounted a famous expedition to travel from Melbourne (in the South of Australia) to the Gulf of Carpenteria in the North. 

Nardoo is an Aboriginal Australian name for a particular variety of fern which produces edible structures called "sporocarps". However, the sporocarps contain an enzyme called thiaminase which breaks down thiamin, causing malnutrition in those who eat it without properly preparing it.

The author of the article, Dave Phoenix, is a PhD candidate at James Cook University whose dissertation focuses on the expedition, and he has personally retraced their journey as part of his research. </TEXT>

Resurrection in Scriptural terms is rising to a *glorified* body in which death is ultimately defeated and selfhood is retained, whereas, in folklore, the word zombie connotes a rotting body which has been reanimated to serve a necromancer and has lost its selfhood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, these aren't merely pleasurable sensations. It causes people genuine discomfort and distress to see others in pain. 

If your description of humanity reduces to Humans experience various neurological phenomena. It has been of survival value for certain of them to be perceived as being more profound. then you dont really have any intellectual resources to say these arent *merely* pleasurable sensations: some of them are more profound than that. 

 This is a powerful motivator.

On naturalism, though, all this is a powerful motivator can be a description of the regularity of certain physical systems. i.e.  certain biochemical assemblages called humans often try to reduce intense feelings of distress be alleviating the pain of others.

Secondly, you seem to be hung up on objectivity when my claim is that no such objectivity exists. It doesn't need to exist to motivate us to engage in moral reasoning. 

Ive already tried to give an argument (the example about the rock with painted on eyes) why I think the objectivity of morality is a necessary precondition for justifiably engaging moral reasoning. How would you respond to it?

Saying Look, observe how there are plenty of people who say that morality is subjective and then they still go on to talk about what actions might promote the flourishing of human beings, or be beautiful, etc. misses the point: its whether one can do so **with any intellectual grounding**.

Person 1: Beliefs A and B are intellectually inconsistent

Person 2: Thats not true at all: I met a man who says that he believes in A and B

Surely you can see how this is a flawed argument?


I don't deny that "I and you possess selfhood" if by that you mean posessing a sense of identity.

But that is just to dodge the question: *everyone* acknowledges that humans have a *sense* of identity: what is in question whether that sense itself is illusory or a perception of the truth. 

I do reject your claim that "it is objectively good to seek the truth". There is no such thing as objective good. Some people might disagree and claim that it is better to accept a comforting lie. 

What those people are really saying is:

"There are some situations in which **it is true** that personal comfort ought to take precedence over intellectual curiosity"

 You really cant escape it.

your explanation for morality still requires us to believe in the existence of some additional something that hasn't been demonstrated. A theory that only makes reference to things that we know exist is more parsimonious.

I agree that if two explanations explain equally well, then Ockhams Razor applies.
I dont think that your explanation actually explains at all, though. </TEXT>

And for those who do have sex, most think that the purpose of sex is recreation not procreation, and pregnancy is a disease to be avoided. The drive to maintain the line is being lost. 

What is the evidence that low birthrates in Japan are due to genetic malfunctioning, rather than societal trends? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not quite correct.

To date, the only document directly addressing evolution thats widely regarded by Catholic theologians as infallible is the 1950 papal encyclical titled Humani Generis by Pope Pius XII. The sections concerning evolution read as follows:

...the Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God...

...When, however, there is question of another conjectural opinion, namely polygenism, the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty. For the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains that either after Adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parent of all, or that Adam represents a certain number of first parents.

I think that synthesising this second paragraph with mainstream anthropological ideas would take the form of something like the following scenario sketched out by Kenneth Kemp:

...begin with a population of about 5,000 hominids, beings which are in many respects like human beings, but which lack the capacity for intellectual thought. Out of this population, God selects two and endows them with intellects by creating for them rational souls, giving them at the same time those preternatural gifts the possession of which constitutes original justice. Only beings with rational souls (with or without the preternatural gifts) are truly human. The first two theologically human beings misuse their free will, however, by choosing to commit a (the original) sin, thereby losing the preternatural gifts, though not the offer of divine friendship by virtue of which they remain theologically (not just philosophically) distinct from their merely biologically human ancestors and cousins. These first true human beings also have descendants, which continue, to some extent, to interbreed with the non-intellectual hominids among whom they live. If God endows each individual that has even a single human ancestor with an intellect of its own, a reasonable rate of reproductive success and a reasonable selective advantage would easily replace a non-intellectual hominid population of 5,000 individuals with a philosophically (and, if the two concepts are extensionally equivalent, theologically) human population within three centuries. Throughout this process, all theologically human beings would be descended from a single original human couple (in the sense of having that human couple among their ancestors) without there ever having been a population bottleneck in the human species.

TL;DR: As far as I am aware, evolution is not a de fide dogma of the Catholic Church but neither is it condemned. 

Catholic believers remain free to embrace either of the following opinions:

1. Some kind of evolutionary scenario such as that described by Kemp above.

2. God created a human couple with no non-human ancestors </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't dancing around the issue: I've regularly seen people say "You can't just give arguments against evolution, you've got to give an argument *for* your position", so I think it's quite appropriate that this be addressed. 

That being said, here's [one example](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19208647). 

The authors write:

-----

"DNA topoisomerases (hereafter referred to as topoisomerases)
are molecular magicians that are **absolutely
essential** to solve topological problems arising from the
double-helical structure of DNA (1,2). Type I topoisomerases
(Topo I) introduce transient DNA single-stranded
breaks in order to change the topological linking number
of a double-stranded DNA molecule by steps of one, whereas type II topoisomerases (Topo II) introduce transient
double-stranded breaks and change the linking
number by steps of two. Although topological problems
are obvious with circular DNA genomes, they also occur
with linear DNA, as indicated by the requirement of
topoisomerases in eukaryotes, and in viruses with long
linear genomes (from around 100 kb to 1 Mb)."

"From such considerations, **one should have naively expected to find in all cells two homologous topoisomerases descendant
from two ancestral topoisomerases present in the
Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)**, which was
usually assumed to contain a DNA genome (3). An intelligent
designer would have probably invented only one
ubiquitous Topo I and one ubiquitous Topo II to facilitate
the task of future biochemists. **The reality turned out to be
quite different, and more interesting**. As in the case of
other enzymes working with DNA, such as DNA polymerases,
the distribution of topoisomerases families and
sub-families among modern organisms is not congruent
with the universal tree of life based on 16S rRNA
sequence comparison (with the trinity Archaea, Bacteria
and Eukarya)."

-----------------

Its particularly ironic that the authors write that we would expect an *intelligent designer* to place the same topoisomerases in all forms of life: in reality, the conservation of essential cellular machinery is a prediction generated by *common descent* , which just isn't matched by the data in this case.

Forterre and Gadelle, in their analysis of the distribution of different types of topoisomerases, propose an auxiliary hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer which attempts to account for this phenomenon and preserve common descent.

*We will consider that a
topoisomerase was present in the last common ancestor of
a particular domain when it is present today in most members
of this domain (covering its phylogenetic diversity),
whereas we will conclude that there was lateral gene transfer
when the enzyme is only present in some members
of the domain and branches within another domain in

<TEXT> I had a thought the other day: won't evidence *against* some hypothesis "a" be *support* for another hypothesis "b" in the case that a and b are known to be the only plausible hypotheses?

It seems to me that one case of this kind of bifurcation would be the question of common descent: either a given set of taxa share a common ancestor, or they do not. 

And so, evidence for common ancestry will, of necessity, be evidence against independent ancestry, and vice versa.

Does anybody disagree? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What are the falsehoods and half truths I have thrown out?

  A and B can get married as they're a straight couple, C and D cannot as they're a gay couple, how is this equal?

We are dealing with two senses of the word "can" here, and I don't think it's sophistic to make this distinction.

The first is that of who is regarded as being married by the government.

The second is whether a person actually *is* married.

Imagine that, after change in legislation, a person can now can be issued a piece of paper saying "I am a married bachelor". 

In one sense they now "can" be married, and married bachelors now have equality with other currently legislated marriages. 

In the other sense, if being a married bachelor is an incoherent concept (which I think it is), then nobody "can" be a married bachelor, and all the existence of a piece of paper which says otherwise just shows that the law has enshrined a falsehood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Taking the case of a rock with a smiley face painted on, when somebody says "it's cruel to heat that rock" we reply to them "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked by the smiley face into thinking that the rock is qualitatively different from other physical systems which it is not cruel to treat in this way."

What I'm trying to say is that, when a naturalist thinks that they have encountered a genuine instance of empathy (i.e. one with a real human, not a rock with a disguise) which provides a justification for treating them differently to an inanimate object, naturalism inescapably leads to the conclusion: "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked into thinking that the human being is qualitatively different from other physical systems which it is clearly **not** cruel to treat in this way (blocks of marble, clouds of helium gas, pools of tar, and so on)

A naturalist might, as you have done, put forward the bare description "I happen to experience certain pleasurable sensations when I think I have found the truth or when I help others"

But this leads to the further question "Why are pleasurable sensations objectively good?" 

Plus, the "I" ends up dissolving in the Darwinian acid too!

As Dan Dennett puts it:

*"Youve got to leave the first person out of your final theory. You wont have a theory of consciousness
if you still have the first person in there, because that was what it was your job to
explain. All the paraphernalia that doesnt make any sense unless youve got a first person in
there, has to be turned into something else. Youve got to figure out some way to break it up
and distribute its powers and opportunities into the system in some other way. "*

Blackmore, S. (2006) Conversations on Consciousness. Oxford: Oxford University Press

All discussion is dependent on the truth of certain propositions like "I and you possess selfhood" and "it is objectively good to seek the truth", and thus if naturalism ends up denying these propositions it's not that therefore it's emotionally unpalatable: it's that it's an incoherent belief system.

----

You also said that it is "simpler" to use a naturalistic explanation rather than to "invoke gods"

I certainly agree that if we take a scenario like: 

"there exist certain arrangements of matter which display certain states 
(which those arrangements of matter call "empathy" or "anguish") because producing those effects
under certain circumstances is an effective
way (or at least, the byproduct of an effective way) for particular sequences of nucleic acids to
perpetuate themselves."

And, taking a broad definition of the word "god" we add to that scenario "An immaterial being more powerful than humans who has some kind of interest in human affairs"

I totally agree that adding in a "god" to this picture doesn't help: the physical account already explains things entirely.

But where I think this fails is that this is an inadequate portrayal of the issue.

Firstly, it misstates the nature of what needs to be explained: what needs to be explained is selves, for whom it is objectively good to seek the truth, not the existence of certain arrangements of matter, as sketched in the scenario above.

Secondly, it misstates Who God is. God is not merely "an agent" who "explains" morality
by the fact that He has certain desires regarding humanity and that we should obey them because
He is smarter or tougher than we are, or something like that. Rather, he Himself is pure Goodness:
God's very being is what our wills are grasping toward.

There's more to both of these points, but that's an outline of what I'm getting at.

How is it not a view?

Some people, including Magda Szubanski, hold the view that, ethically, marriage is a union between two people, of any combination of gender, and that the law should reflect that.

Other people have other views.

Unless you are decrying a kind of relativism in which you see the word "view" as connoting "mere subjective  opinion", which I would also agree is an inaccurate portrayal of this issue, I don't see what the problem is.

<TEXT>  Voting on other people to have equal rights isn't a good enough start for you?

Phrasing the issue as "denying equality" presupposes precisely what is in question, though:

If you are correct that marriage is between two people, then traditional marriage proponents are denying peoples rights.
If we are correct that marriage is between a man and a woman, then nobody is denying anything when they seek for that to truth be upheld in the law.

As an analogy, imagine if I saturated the media with the question Why do same-sex marriage proponents want to lie about what marriage really is?

Presumably you would answer something to the effect of Well, I dont think Im lying, I think that I have the true view of what marriage is, and I want the law to reflect that. You can clearly see how this begs the question i.e. presupposes that my position is true. </TEXT>

What if it's just a fantasy, and doesn't focus on some particular person who actually exists? To add to this, perhaps the person in the scenario might sneer and dismiss "honour" as being just as much a primitive superstition as the natural law proponent's "proper use", because it's "intangible", unlike the narrow sense of harm previously mentioned.

if we had an innate sense that homosexuality is intrinsically evil, you wouldn't be able to convince a majority of Americans that it's not evil

Surely it's possible for whole societies to fall into massive moral errors, though? I'm sure a 19th century Southern American defender of slavery could say "If slavery is immoral, then why haven't you been able to persuade a large number of Southerners that it is?" </TEXT>

without evidence, any assertion may be dismissed, and design falls firmly in that category

Where does Henderson actually say this, though? I really think Craig's representation is more accurate than yours.

 If you're unfamiliar, I suggest going over the trial

I'm *very* familiar with the history of this topic. Here are some previous posts of mine on why I think ID isn't accurately characterised as creationism:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/4enlfh/why_does_the_opposition_to_the_christian_claim/d228hy9

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3n7wym/is_intelligent_design_fairly_categorised_as_a/

I'm quite happy to say that there is significant sociological overlap between ID and conservative Christianity, and that the underlying motivation for many ID proponents is how they see it fits in with their theological views, but I really think that a lot of people have an overly simplistic view of this topic which doesn't seem to go much beyond "Judge Jones said it, I believe it, that settles it for me".

<TEXT> I think Russell's Teapot fails for the following reason:

Russell argues that, suppose that somebody proposes that a teapot orbits the Sun, but that it's too small to be revealed by scientific investigation. Surely it would be absurd to propose that the lack of evidence for a teapot in orbiting the Sun means that we should reserve judgement on its existence?

The reason why it seems intuitively unreasonable to ask people to reserve their judgement on the existence of the teapot is because we have good arguments *against* its existence: it is very unlikely that a teapot could be formed naturally in outer space. It is very unlikely, that a teapot could, unaided by humans, reach the velocity of 25,000km/h needed to escape from the earths gravity. Given the immense effort to conserve weight, it is also unlikely that any stowaway teapots may have accidentally found their way onto a spacecraft and then become lost during the journey. And so on.

<TEXT> William Lane Craig is helpful here:

*"The much beloved Flying Spaghetti Monster was the concoction of Bobby Henderson, who in the summer of 2005 wrote a satirical letter to the State Board of Education of Kansas to protest the use of textbook stickers promoting Intelligent Design. It (or he, as the Monster is personal) has gone on to become an international sensation (see Hendersons website at www.venganza.org/).*

*Henderson used the noodley Monster to parody the inference to an Intelligent Designer of the universe. He wrote, Let us remember that there are multiple theories of Intelligent Design. I and many others around the world are of the strong belief that the universe was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster. It was He who created all that we see and all that we feel. Henderson claimed to know quite a bit about the nature of the Flying Spaghetti Monster:*

*. . . it may be helpful to tell you a little more about our beliefs. We have evidence that a Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe. None of us, of course, were around to see it, but we have written accounts of it. We have several lengthy volumes explaining all details of His power. . . . He is of course invisible and can pass through normal matter with ease. . . . I have included an artistic drawing of Him creating a mountain, trees, and a midget.*

*As the drawing shows, the Monster is composed of two large meatballs surrounded by a mass of spaghetti topped with two eyeballs. Its evident that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is supposed to be a finite, physical object which, for some unexplained reason, is not perceptible to our senses.*

*Great fun! But now what is the point of the parody? What does it show? Its striking that Hendersons parody does nothing to call into question either the legitimacy or necessity of the inference to an Intelligent Designer of the universe. Rather the point of the parody seems to be that we cannot know much, if anything, about the nature of the Designer. Therefore, its arbitrary to characterize the Designer of the universe as God, especially the God of some specific religion.*

*Whats curious about this parody is that ID theorists like William Dembski have been insisting on this same point for years, but everyone seems to think them disingenuous. Dembski makes it abundantly clear that on the basis of the specified complexity in the universe one cannot infer that the Designer is infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and so forth. It is precisely for that reason that ID theorists deny that ID is disguised religion. The identification of the Designer with God is a theological conclusion that cannot itself be warranted on the basis of the design argument alone.*

*Dembski writes,*

*"Insofar as design theorists do not bring up God, it is because design-theoretic reasoning does not warrant bringing up God. Design-theoretic reasoning tells us that certain patterns exhibited in nature reliably point to a designing intelligence. But theres no inferential chain that leads from such finite design-conducing patterns in nature to the infinite personal transcendent creator God of the worlds major theistic faiths. . . . As a Christian I hold that the Christian God is the ultimate source of design behind the universe. . . . But theres no way for design inferences from physics or biology to reach that conclusion. . . . Far from being coy or deceitful, when design theorists do not bring up God, it is because they are staying within the proper scope of their theory (The Design Revolution, p. 26)."*

*Therefore, Dembski is adamant that religious interpretations of Intelligent Design should not be taught in public classrooms. Dembski himself, had he thought of it, might have appealed to the Flying Spaghetti Monster to illustrate his point! Ironically, then, Hendersons parody actually reinforces one of the central contentions of the ID movement, that it is not religious teaching. The inference to a Designer is not an inference to any particular deity."* </TEXT>

<TEXT> it is the human condition to rationalise our feelings to ourselves. Why am I feeling this way? It must surely be because it is a bad thing to suffer, etc.

That's not true: we often recognise that we experience sensory illusions of various kinds.

We find things like this disturbing because our brains are pretty good at detecting agency and sometimes this can mislead us and cause us to empathise with objects that are neither living nor suffering.

All you are doing there is saying that there are particular sets of conditions which often produce empathy in human beings, and sometimes we get some false positives (e.g. rocks with smiley faces).

It doesn't matter whether or not they are qualitatively different.

It does, because we all recognise that somebody who thinks that their empathy for a rock with a drawn on smiley face is a truthful perception of the world is mistaken, and on this scheme, it's ultimately **all** false positives. 

You might *get the impression* that your spouse who is weeping because they are suffering from an illness is qualitatively different to a rock with a smiley face being split open, but they aren't in the end.

there is no aught here.

*Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing?* </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We start with what feels wrong and this arises due to a powerful sense of empathy and provides the motivation to engage in moral reasoning

Why does possessing a sense of empathy "provide a motivation" to engage in moral reasoning? 

 But keep in mind that our moral intuitions are not flippant things like "favourite flavour of ice cream" - they are deeply ingrained in us and it causes us real anguish when we see others suffer.

To draw out the absurdity, we would consider a person to be mistaken if they said "it is **cruel** to heat mineral X to 200 degrees Celsius because unlike mineral Y, when this happens, 80% of the time it releases a gas."

Similarly, saying that moral sensations "aren't flippant" is to commit the same mistake, on this scheme: the fact that aggregates of matter have particular arrangements which produce effects which we call "anguish" or that such effects occur with regularity (i.e. are "deeply ingrained") doesn't show that they are ultimately qualitatively different from 200 degrees Celsius causing the effect of gas release from mineral X 80% of the time. 

On this scheme, one might be given the *impression* that certain physical phenomena are "less flippant", but that impression is itself, merely another physical phenomenon, not a perception of some real qualitative difference.

"It is objectively good to seek the truth" but it is my opinion that truth seeking is a more rewarding and less risky path to follow and because I like it so much

Why does the fact that you experience pleasure from holding a belief imply that you should hold it?

<TEXT>  The feeling that it is wrong is ultimately a powerful SUBJECTIVE feeling that is shared by most people.

A few questions:

1 . In situations where we recognise that certain things are merely subjective, we usually make statements like "You may have the impression that vanilla icecream is a better flavour than raspberry, but that's ultimately all it is, and you can't impose that on others."

And, similarly, doesn't this view inescapably lead to the conclusion "Certain people think what Hitler did was right, others (like /u/Aceofspades25) think it was horrific, but we can't impose our own subjective tastes on each other, now, can we?". 

2 . You mention that most humans agree with you, but a large proportion of people experiencing a subjective impression that genocide is wrong is quite compatible with the truth of nihilism.

3 . How is this your position not self-refuting? The fact that you are making *any* statement and seeking to persuade somebody presupposes the truth of the proposition "It is objectively good to seek the truth". </TEXT>

Polyphyletic has no **a** in it, and thus doesn't include a common **ancestor** of all the taxa in the group.

<TEXT>  Solomon was a revered king of Israel, in what was and is looked on as a golden age. Whatever happened later, god clearly sanctioned him

Where on earth did you get this bizarre view that whatever happened in Solomon's reign, God approved?

The condemnation of Solomon is explicit in 1 Kings 11:3-13

"Solomon married seven hundred princesses and also had three hundred concubines. They made him turn away from God, and by the time he was old they had led him into the worship of foreign gods. He was not faithful to the Lord his God, as his father David had been.  He worshiped Astarte, the goddess of Sidon, and Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon. **He sinned against the Lord** and was not true to him as his father David had been.  On the mountain east of Jerusalem he built a place to worship Chemosh, the disgusting god of Moab, and a place to worship Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon. He also built places of worship where all his foreign wives could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their own gods.

Even though the Lord, the God of Israel, had appeared to Solomon twice and had commanded him not to worship foreign gods, Solomon did not obey the Lord but turned away from him. So the Lord was angry with Solomon and said to him, **Because you have deliberately broken your covenant with me and disobeyed my commands**, I promise that I will take the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your officials.  However, for the sake of your father David I will not do this in your lifetime, but during the reign of your son. And I will not take the whole kingdom away from him; instead, I will leave him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have made my own.

This really isn't "my spin". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for continuing to engage with me.

 That's different from "acquired from a retrovirus."

I don't see what you're getting at with that distinction. The first paper says *"This gene, encoding a protein that we have called syncytin, is the envelope gene of a recently identified human endogenous defective retrovirus, HERV-W."*

It doesn't seem to be saying "those are genes, not ERVs".


 it shows that different cells express different sets of transcription factors, so ERVs will only be active in some subset of cells.

What if the activity is [only present in taxa which have the ERVs, though?](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/11/gbe.evv049.full.pdf+html)

I  have heard the objection that these sequences are undergoing spurious transcription, but I hadn't heard about the rapid degradation of the transcript before. Would you mind giving me a reference for that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's take the example given at 2:29 in the video, that Solomon is described as having multiple wives. The video makes the unjustified leap that because a particular behaviour is described in Scripture, this implies that is being set up an ethical ideal. 

If you take a look Deuteronomy 17:17, you'll see that a King of Israel shouldn't take multiple wives "**lest his heart turn away**". And we see just this happening Solomon's later life, "for when Solomon was old his wives **turned away his heart after other gods**" (1 Kings 11:4). It's clearly serving as a lesson in what *not* to do.

The sad fact is that this kind of media is really shallow stuff, but it still gets applauded by people who pride themselves on being "critical-thinkers" and "educated" and so forth, not realising the painful intellectual inadequacy of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   none of it qualifies as functional.

Haven't some researchers discovered that at least some sequences which were putatively ERV-derived can have a functional role though?

E.g.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4827613/

http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010044

Regulatory regions like promoters, enhancers, and silencers are all non-coding but extremely important functionally. 

And aren't there [plenty of promoters in ERV sequences](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18535086)? </TEXT>

Arrogance is when a person has an inaccurate overestimation of their own state, isn't it? Can you see how this is impossible when we are talking about God, Who is perfect?

I'm not a moral relativist like you are, I apply morality to everyone equally, including god.

No, what you are doing is treating God as, at best, a being which merely possess goodness, beauty etc, in the manner that humans do, but to some greater degree. But this isn't "equality": this is a fundamental error about Who God is. </TEXT>

I think your thought process seems to to be"If a human told us to worship them, we'd think that they were really full of themself, because they'd have an inaccurate self-perception. Therefore, if God told us to worship Him, he would similarly be faulted."

Again: given that God, *unlike human beings*, is the source of all that is good, it is fitting that we worship Him, and sinful if we refuse to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might Makes Right is your entire argument. 

I don't think your summary is justified. I agree totally that simply being more powerful or more benevolent than Kim Jong Il doesn't make one worthy of worship, and I didn't argue that in my post. Rather, I think God is worthy of worship, not because he possesses characteristics like goodness, etc. to some greater degree, but because He Himself is pure Goodness in his very nature.

, according to the Bible, God's very name is "Jealous", for starters.

As far as I am aware, when God is described as jealous, this typically refers to prophets urging Israel to turn back and worship God. I don't see how Israel having this unique place in salvation history and being warned about coming judgement implies that God possesses some "need" for worship.

As I've said elsewhere in this thread, If one does not inherit eternal life, then God's justice cannot be faulted, as the offer of it is utterly gratuitous on His part.

Beyond that, any pains that will be experienced would be presumably proportionate to the way one has lived.

So, I don't think the justice of God could be faulted in such a case.

I completely agree that baldly asserting that something is the source of all good doesn't make that true, and that
this is an important and valid question, but it really is quite a separate question to the objection as set out in my original post. I'd like to try to focus on one argument for this thread.

Does anybody know any other good slow melodies arranged for trumpet and organ which would be suitable to be played during communion?

Our priest preached well, and used a quote from St Benedict that a disciple is somebody who prefers nothing else to Christ, and tied that in to the Gospel reading (Luke 14:26-35). 

The final hymn "O Jesus I Have Promised" (Tune: Thornbury) was a real ripper, and fit in with the Gospel reading and sermon, I thought. </TEXT>

I'd argue that the convertibility of transcendentals implies that that which is the source of being must also be the source of goodness.

Why does God need to be glorified? What's wrong with him emotionally that he needs that or thinks he's entitled to it?

Why do you presume that God's glorification must proceed from some inner lack?

<TITLE> On the objection that God is a celestial dictator who unpleasantly commands us to worship Him </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-03 09:40:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some skeptics have argued against Christianity in the following manner.

**Arrogance**

- Scripture contains exhortations to worship God during our earthly lives, and condemns Israel's failure to do so properly. 
 
- The final state of the redeemed includes the praise of God throughout eternity

- It doesn't seem to fit with the alleged greatness of God that He would command others to worship
Him. After all, doesn't it seem arrogant when people like Kim Jong Il or other dictators do this on earth? 

Along these lines, Christopher Hitchens once said 

*I used to wonder when I was a kid, what would it be like praising God and thanking him all day and all night? 
Well, now I know because North Korea is a completely worshipful state. 
It's set up only to do that, for adoration and its only one short of a trinity. 
They have a father and the son, as you know, the Dear Leader and the Great Leader."*

He goes on to ask Who would really want this?

I think we can unpack this objection by asking: why *is* the self-aggrandisement of the North Korean leaders
so bad, anyway?

Let me submit that it is because there is an incongruency between the way they are presented
and the way they really are:

To ascribe to Kim Jong Il that, for example, he is the 
*true source* of all good things in North Korea seems wrong because it is ultimately, an untruth: he is but a sinful fellow creature. 

That is, it's so absurd precisely because he  is *not God*.

And so, I think the Christian can quite happily agree that if God were merely an immaterial version of Kim Jong Il, then He would indeed not be worthy of worship, but that in terms of addressing the internal consistency of Christianity, the objection doesn't hit home.


**Emotional neediness**

Another aspect of this argument is an alleged contradiction between the perfection of God, and Gods command to worship Him. Doesnt commanding somebody to worship you necessarily imply a kind of emotional insecurity and neediness in God which would contradict his purported perfection?

Again, I think the Christian can partially agree with this argument: if God was the kind of being that commanded people to worship Him on the basis of personal insecurity, then that *would* seem to contradict with Him being perfect.

However, I think that the commands to worship God in Scripture have a different basis:

1. To glorify God. 


2. By God's grace, when we persevere and worship Him, we are sowing seeds that will be reaped in eternity. It is fitting for us and to our own benefit that we worship God.

<TEXT> I think the following reflection by Ed Feser is helpful:

*"... according to Christian theology, God offered to our first parents more than what was owed to us given our nature.  He offered us a supernatural gift.  Here it is crucial to understand what supernatural means in this context.  It has nothing to do with ghosts, goblins, and the like.  What is meant is rather that God offered us a good that went above or beyond what our nature required us to have.  In particular, he offered Adam and Eve the beatific vision  a direct, face to face knowledge of the divine essence which far transcends the very limited knowledge of God we can have through natural reason, and which would entail unsurpassable bliss of a kind we could never attain given our natural powers.  He also offered special helps that would deliver us from the limitations of our natures  that would free us from the ignorance and error our intellectual limitations open the door to, the moral errors our weak wills lead us into, the sicknesses and injuries our bodily limitations make possible, and so forth.*

*By definition, none of this was owed to us, precisely because it is supernatural.  Hence while God cannot fail to will for us what is good for us given our nature, He would have done us no wrong in refraining from offering these supernatural gifts to us, precisely because they go beyond what our nature requires for our fulfillment.  Still, He offered them to us anyway.  But this offer was conditional.* 

*The fall of man*

*The condition was the obedience of our first parents.  Yet they did not obey.  And of course, that is the point of the account of their eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.  It wasnt fruit per se that was important, but rather the will to rebel against the Creator.  (Recall Augustines youthful theft of the pears, where what was attractive about the theft was the fact that it was forbidden, not the fact that he got some pears out of it.)  The penalty was the loss of the supernatural gifts they had been given and that their descendants would have been given, and a fall back into their merely natural state, with all its limitations.  In particular, it was a loss of all the helps that would effectively have removed those limitations -- and worst of all, loss of the beatific vision.*

*In short, the penalty of original sin was a privation, not a positive harm inflicted on human beings but rather the absence of a benefit they never had a right to or strict need for in the first place but would have received anyway had they not disobeyed.  And it wasnt the prospect of pitchforks and hellfire that Adams descendents had to look forward to because of what Adam did, but rather the privation of this supernatural gift.  What is essential to Hell is the loss of the beatific vision, and while Hell can certainly also involve more than that (including the pains of sense) the standard view is that it does so only for those guilty of actual sin, and not those (such as infants who die without baptism) who merely suffer the penalty of original sin, without ever having committed actual sin.  (For this reason the Scholastic tradition came to settle around the view that infants who die without baptism, and thus without removal of the penalty of original sin, probably enjoy perpetual natural happiness -- the highest state we could have attained without being raised to the supernatural gift of the beatific vision.)*

*You might compare the situation to that of a landowner who has sold an unimproved parcel of land to a certain family  which, just to be cute, well call the Adams family.  In allowing the Adamses to take possession of the parcel, hes given them everything he owed them.  But suppose he offers to throw in, for free, something extra  to plant on the land a vineyard using the finest quality vines, whose fruit will make possible the best wine.  This is something that all the descendents of the original Adamses who bought the land will profit from.  But the landowner makes the offer only conditionally.  He wants to see how Mr. and Mrs. Adams are going to handle things before turning the vineyard over to the Adams family as a whole, including the many descendents who are not likely to do any better with the vines than their ancestors are.  So if Mr. and Mrs. Adams do well with the first vines planted, they and their descendents will get to keep them and reap the benefits.  If not, the landowner will tear them out and leave the Adamses and their descendents with only the original unimproved parcel, which is all they were owed in the first place.* 

*Now suppose that Mr. and Mrs. Adams botch things up, and the landowner removes the vineyard.  The fault is entirely theirs, but all their descendents necessarily suffer the penalty just as much as they do, just by virtue of being Adamses.  Yet it is not a positive harm that is inflicted on them, but rather the loss of a benefit they were not entitled to but nevertheless would have received if not for the actions of their ancestors.* 

*The hereditary stain*

*Notice that there is nothing the least bit unjust about the landowners actions, since he never owed the vineyard to any of the Adamses in the first place.  He would have done Mr. and Mrs. Adams no wrong if he had refrained from offering the vineyard, and he does none of their descendants wrong in denying it to them.  Notice also that there is nothing remotely mysterious about how our fictional Adamses inherit the penalty of Mr. and Mrs. Adams error, and do so genetically.  For they do so, not because theyve got some strange vineyard-losing gene but rather simply because they are the biological descendents of Mr. and Mrs. Adams, and the deal that would have gained or lost them the vineyard was a deal made with Mr. and Mrs. Adams on their behalf.*

*Similarly, we inherit the penalty of original sin, not in the sense that weve got some original sin gene alongside genes for eye color and tooth enamel, but rather in the sense that the offer of the supernatural gifts was made to the human race as a whole through their first parent acting as their representative.  Inheriting this penalty from Adam is more like inheriting your fathers name or bank account than it is like inheriting his looks or his temperament.  And there is no more injustice in this inheritance than there is in the landowners not planting a vineyard for Mr. and Mrs. Adams descendents."*

O wie schn ist deine Welt,

Vater, wenn sie golden strahlet!

Wenn dein Glanz herniederfllt

Und den Staub mit Schimmer malet,

Wenn das Rot, das in der Wolke blinkt,

In mein stilles Fenster sinkt!

---

Knnt ich klagen, knnt ich zagen?

Irre sein an dir und mir?

Nein, ich will im Busen tragen

Deinen Himmel schon allhier.

Und dies Herz, eh' es zusammenbricht,

Trinkt noch Glut und schlrft noch Licht.


-----

O how beautiful is your world,

Father, when she shines with golden beams!

When Your gaze descends

And paints the dust with a shimmering glowing,

When the red, which flashes in the clouds,

Sinks into my quiet window!

-----

How could I complain, how could I be afraid?

How could anything ever be amiss between You and me?

No, I will carry in my breast

Your Heaven for all times.

And this heart, before it breaks down,

Shall drink in the glow and the light. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The other one is that marriage is "defined" as being between a man and a woman, so if you change it it's not marriage.

Of course that's completely circular and beside the point.

I agree that this is a bad argument as presented, but I think there might be a miscommunication going on here with the use of the word "defined".

When people say "marriage is *defined* as being between a man and a woman", they might not be referring to the current legal definition of some country. Rather, they are making the claim that marriage is not merely a social construct but something which is, by its nature, between a man and a woman. 

And so they are saying that marriage is "defined" in this latter sense, as being between a man and a woman, and that consequently the law should reflect that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are trying to persuade who believes in some position "A", but disbelieves in another position "B" merely saying "A is similar to B in that both propose a narrower legal restriction of something than some other views. Therefore, to be consistent" is inadequate. 

You yourself probably hold some views that  propose a narrower legal restriction of something than other views, but I don't think you'd take the statement "You're just like those who want to legally restrict marriage to separate races" as a convincing argument in these situations.

What needs to be done is to discuss how the two cases are actually analogous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Claiming that people are "denying equality" presupposes precisely what is in question:

If you are correct that marriage is between two people, then traditional marriage proponents are denying peoples rights.
If we are correct that marriage is between a man and a woman, then nobody is denying anything when they seek for that to truth be upheld in the law.

As an analogy, imagine if I saturated the media with the question Why do same-sex marriage proponents want to lie about what marriage really is?

Presumably you would answer something to the effect of Well, I dont think Im lying, I think that I have the true view of what marriage is, and I want the law to reflect that. You can clearly see how this begs the question i.e. presupposes that my position is true. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The question is "A RE with a 4 bp recognition sequence will cut DNA in X times as many places as one with a 5 bp recognition sequence?

Given that there are 4 standard nucleotides, and assuming a random distribution of nucleotides in the sequence, the probability of getting a given 4 nucleotide sequence will be (1/4)^4, and for a 5 bp sequence it will be (1/4)^5,
and thus our answer is "4 times as many". </TEXT>

<TEXT>   To proclaim that Joseph violated her is equally insulting as to say that David mounted the Ark and fornicated on it. 

I'm a believer in the perpetual virginity of Mary, but I don't think Catholics are doing themselves any favours when they say that Joseph having normal marital intercourse with Mary would be a "violation" and "insulting". Isn't this an example the low view of sex that so many unbelievers accuse Christians of having? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The technical definition is same basic structure, different function

Right, so we've got some people who think the "technical definition" is one thing, and we've got others, including one of the most prominent biologists of the 20th century who thinks something different. If you read the link, then you'll see the same definition is used by Douglas Futuyma in
his widely used textbook "Evolution". This isn't some eccentricity of Mayr's.

 Responding to my point with "well this other guys says something different" does nothing to address the point I made.

You explicitly claimed **"Common ancestry is not part of the definition."** I'm disputing that statement. 

I was under the impression that we were discussing the issue

I think whether multiple incompatible definitions of homology have been used *is* the issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Common ancestry is not part of the definition

No less than Ernst Mayr, in his book "The Growth of Biological Thought" wrote: "The term *homologous* existed already prior to 1859, but it acquired its currently accepted meaning only when Darwin established the theory of common descent. Under this theory the biologically most meaningful definition of homology is "A feature in two or more taxa is homologous when it is derived from the same (or a corresponding) feature of their common ancestor".

That's not to say that others haven't used the word in other senses, but there are certainly numerous biologists who have used the word to mean "characteristics which are derived from a common ancestor".

<TITLE> Circular reasoning in evolution? (x-post /r/Creation) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-16 11:36:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Theres a wonderful volume titled Galileo goes to Jail and other Myths about Science and Religion published by Harvard University Press, and one of the "myths" is That the theory of organic evolution is based on circular reasoning, authored by Nicolaas Rupke.

Rupke himself is an interesting person: he is currently a historian of science, but initially trained as a geologist and was also a Young-Earth Creationist in his younger years. Alas, he lost his faith when he entered Princeton Universitys doctoral program in geology. His essay deals with both the geological column and homology, but this post concentrates on the latter.

Heres a section from Rupkes essay:

In Icons of Evolution (2000), [Jonathan] Wells discusses why
much of what we teach about evolution is wrong. One of the
icons he cites, conventionally used as proof of evolution, is
the phenomenon of homology. But what precisely is homology?
Wells asks. Under the heading Homology and circular
reasoning, he explains that evolutionary biologists define the
term as the similarity between different species that is due to
their shared ancestry. In other words, homology indicates evolution
and evolution produces homology  a perfect circular
argument.

*Consider the example of bone patterns in forelimbs, which Darwin
regarded as evidence for the common ancestry of the vertebrates.
A neo-Darwinist who wants to determine whether vertebrate
forelimbs are homologous must first determine whether they [the
species being compared] are derived from a common ancestor. In
other words, there must be evidence for common ancestry before
limbs can be called homologous. But then to turn around and argue
that homologous limbs point to common ancestry is a vicious circle:
Common ancestry demonstrates homology which demonstrates
common ancestry.*

It becomes no easier for the DarwinistsWells maintains
when they turn to the fossil record to help determine evolutionary
relationships. *Unfortunately, comparing fossils is no more
straightforward than comparing live specimens... Any attempt
to infer evolutionary relationships among fossils based on
homology- as- common- ancestry soon leads to a tangle of circular
arguments from which there is no escape. *

Some evolutionists have talked back in an effort to absolve
themselves from the sins of chasing their tails. But this has
proved no easy matter. Creation scientists arent fools and,
**strictly speaking, do have logic on their side in the major cases
cited here.** Moreover, they have been able to amass quotations
from concerned evolutionists who apprehensively admit to the
illogical practices of which they stand accused. Quite likely,
a variety of paleontologico- stratigraphical studies are unreliable
because they are founded on a petitio principii (the logical fallacy
of begging the question).

All the same, the assertion that evolution is crucially based on
circular arguments is a myth."

(citations removed, my bolding)

Rupke goes on to discuss how the term homology was originally coined by Richard Owen, an English anatomist, in his book On the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton. For Owen, a homologue was defined as The same organ in different animals
under every variety of form and function., which Owen, as an old-earth creationist, interpreted as evidence of a repeated divine design. Rupke also notes that Owen later began to become more open to a theistic evolutionary view point.

Rupke also discusses how Darwin himself took these observations about vertebrate skeletons, and argued that they were characteristics derived from a common ancestor. Darwin argued in the 14th chapter of the Origin of Species that, for example, because there is no functional reason for the pentadactyl limb to be shared by humans moles, horses, porpoises, bats, therefore it was better explained by descent with modification. 

My comment: I think Rupke is correct insofar as, even if you have some disagreements with it, you can follow the structure of Darwins argument concerning vertebrate skeletons, and the argument itself certainly isn't circular.

However, I think the problem lies in that we have examples of biologists using both definitions of the term homology, creating a circular argument.

Jonathan Wells remains correct in calling this out.

I may be misunderstanding you, but I don't think what you're talking about is true: I think it's more common for creationists to believe based on what Scripture seems to say, not because it is thought that some overwhelming case from the natural sciences can currently be made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Simultaneously, however, Christians begin buying into the implicit claim that the natural sciences are the best way to know anything is true - and since the Bible is true, it must also accord with the natural sciences.

I disagree, because I think there's a big stream of Reformed-style presuppositionalism in creationism, which emphasises science being epistemologically subsequent to and dependent on theology/philosophy.

As for the claim that, with considerations of genre/metaphor etc. taken into account, the Bible won't contradict the findings of the natural sciences, isn't that just the kind of thing that's found in 
things like Dei Verbum and the Syllabus of Errors? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Your argument is weak to begin with because these examples, regardless of how appropriate it is to compare them, are not enough evidence on which to build a representative picture of two groups of scientists.

I recognise that, there's a legitimate concern in that it is just the nature of the case that, because of the sheer scope of biology, you aren't going to have just a handful of "knockdown" pieces of evidence.

But I guess I get a bit frustrated that 
when people ask "What's a good book to read that gives some really good arguments for why evolution is true?" Coyne's 
book is very frequently recommended (e.g. [the recommended books on /r/evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/wiki/recommended/reading).)

And then, if you get somebody to concede that serious errors are present in works like this, suddenly Coyne seems to be a lot less important, and you can't
judge the field based on one book and so forth... </TEXT>

<TITLE>   </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let me try to demonstrate my approach with the following example:

http://blog.drwile.com/?p=1309

One often hears that, to be a creationist, one must hold that "scientists are engaged in a conspiracy", and that to reject the consensus of biologists in this area, while simultaneously accepting the fruits of mainstream science in other areas is intellectually inconsistent.

I know it's only one example but I don't think this is nitpicking some obscure paper: surely in a popular book in which you want to persuade people "Why Evolution Is True" and textbooks, experts should present the strongest, most unambiguous examples for their position. And if isn't happening, then I think this is telling.

Consider William Harvey's summary of his groundbreaking studies on the heart. Harvey wrote:

"*It has been shown by reason and experiment that blood by the beat of the ventricles flows through the lungs and heart and is pumped to the whole body. There it passes through pores in the flesh into the veins through which it returns from the periphery everywhere to the centre, from the smaller veins into the larger ones, finally coming to the vena cava and right atrium. This occurs in such an amount, with such an outflow through the arteries and such a reflux through the veins, that it cannot be supplied by the food consumed. It is also much more than is needed for nutrition. It must therefore be concluded that the blood in the animal body moves around in a circle continuously and that the action or function of the heart is to accomplish this by pumping. This is only reason for the motion and beat of the heart.*"

I suppose my question to you would be where, in Harvey's work, a modern textbook, or even a popular account of the cardiovascular system by an expert can we find examples as bad, as ambiguous, as Coynes lanugo argument being used to defend this conclusion? 

When somebody says *Nothing in cardiovascular physiology makes sense except in the light of the view pioneered by Harvey* I don't think there are any analogous faults in the evidence provided.

Whereas, when somebody says "*Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution*, bloopers like Coyne's abound.

I guess it's this kind of thing that leads me to feel comfortable in that, if I ever need heart surgery, I'll trust the consensus of mainstream science, and that considering the history of life on earth, I dissent.

Addendum:

Just to preempt the [common objection](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB360.html) "so what if lanugo has *some* function? That's still compatible with it being vestigial". 

While there is a grain of truth to this objection, in that one frequently encounters formulations of this kind of argument which describe the characteristic in question as having "less efficiency than wed expect or something similar, rather than saying "no function", I still think it's true that we also find the latter formulation as well.

In this case, Coyne says that "theres **no** need for a human embryo to have a transitory coat of hair." and I think there being functional reason for lanugo effectively answers his argument.

<TEXT> I disagree with the narrative that "ID=creationism", and here's a few examples showing why:

It seems to me that, in the 1980s, a number of thinkers began to emphasise Look, these kinds of arguments from design *can* be decoupled from any particular religious system. Why not just assess them on those grounds?. 

Fred Hoyle, the irreligious English astrophysicist and scientific maverick suggested that abiogenesis was scientifically impossible, and that life arrived on earth by being seeded from outer space. 

*"if one proceeds directly and straightforwardly in this matter, without being deflected by a fear of incurring the wrath of scientific opinion, one arrives at the conclusion that biomaterials with their amazing measure of order must be the outcome of intelligent design."* (Fred Hoyle, Evolution From Space 1981)

In 1986, the Oxford Union held a debate on the proposition That the doctrine of creation is more valid than the theory of evolution. Arthur Wilder-Smith, an English chemist and pharmacologist debating for the creationist side, remarked 

*The scientific creationist says that you need, above natural law, extrinsic information. He does not specify where youre going to get it from. He believes, with Noam Chomsky, that the origin of information, because its a surprise effect, is not attackable by the human brain, and I believe the same. Second thing is that the religious creationist, and I dont speak tonight as a religious creationist, I speak as a scientific creationist, I didnt come here to teach Madame President or anybody else anything about religious creation. I say, from a scientific point of view, you must have, as Hoyle has pointed out, a source of information, surprise effects, acting on inorganic matter in order to do it. The religious creationist says God did it or Allah did it or Yahweh did it or Jesus Christ did it. Im not talking about that, Im saying from a scientific point of view, the scientific method is to add extrinsic information to the system in order to get out an order which isnt intrinsic to inorganic matter.*

In 1984, Lane Lester, Professor of biology at Liberty University, and Ray Bohlin, a doctoral student in molecular biology at the University of Texas, Dallas, published The Natural Limits to Biological Change. While the book was published by Zondervan, a Christian publisher, the first seven chapters of the book merely survey and critique evolutionary biology. The eighth chapter presents Another Alternative. The authors remark *Design in nature has been a topic of debate for centuries. We have no intention of trying to argue conclusively on a philosophic basis that intelligent design disproves any evolutionary theory. Rather, we hope to show briefly by example that the need for intelligence in bringing about the various designs in nature is by no means a preposterous proposition.* They go on to say that, in attempting to describe the limits to biological change, this is *essentially the creationists concept of the created kind.* And I think they argued that simply because their idea fitted in with biblical creationism, didn't mean it was reducible to it.

In 1984, Thaxton, Olsen and Bradley published "The Mystery of Life's Origin", a text widely regarded as a seminal work in the ID movement.

Note that all of these examples are dated *before* Edwards vs. Aguillard in 1987, the case which prohibited the teaching of creationism in the US, and which allegedly was responsible for the modern ID movement according to many. So I don't think this popular narrative of "ID was just designed to get around constitutional requirements after Edwards vs. Aguillard" is quite accurate.

I will concede that there is a lot of conceptual overlap between ID and creationism, and it seems that a creationist textbook ("Of Pandas and People" ) was rejigged to become an ID textbook after Edwards vs Aguillard, but I think that this is just one point of data, and can't be used to characterise the whole issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Is the competition amongst man and beasts too mundane to have a meaning?

I hope I'm not preempting you falsely, but  one thought typically given by a lot of atheists in this line of discussion is something along the lines of

"Yeah, I know that all my impulses are ultimately meaningless physical phenomena, but that 
doesn't stop me finding meaning in loving my spouse and children/making artwork/learning new things"

However, all this is just a personal report that you happen to experience "feelings of meaning".
And that certain people might have the impression of meaningful activity is quite
compatible with the truth of nihilism.

It's not just some "arbitrary exception", though: reasons are given for the premises.

<TEXT> This weekend, I was in a small town of ~20,000 people for a musical engagement. I've got to say, experiencing romantic rejection from a fellow musician who I'm really drawn to and sometimes spend a bit of time with has ended up being the biggest challenge to my faith I've experienced so far in my life. I think I'm working through it on an intellectual level, though. 

Went to church:

-They had a young (20s) minister, but a very old congregation. Apart from a couple of children, every one of their ~40 parishioners looked 50+ years old. It made me quite sad to see it.

-Received communion and got to sing two great hymns "Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness" and "In faith and hope and love", and that was good. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I have no idea what you're talking about.

The commonly used phrase "Those people aren't really pro-life: they are just pro-birth". I thought that that was what you were getting at in your comment.

The term 'pro-life' is a chipper label used by anti-abortion people who want to frame their position as a positive one.

Well, of course if you disagree with us, then you'll think that the label is a misnomer. One could equally say "pro-choice is a chipper label used by pro-death people who want to frame their position as a positive one." But it's just question-begging points-scoring that gets us nowhere. Why not let people use their self-designation? I'm perfectly happy with people using "pro-choice" to describe their position. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I'm correctly guessing what you are getting at, then I think this kind of remark is a result of the current state of conservatism in the US, which places such great emphasis on reducing state expenditure.

I'd like to make two remarks.

Firstly, the reason that many pro-life conservatives in the US are opposed to publically funded initiatives for mothers and children is not because they don't care about children post-birth: it's that they believe that privately funded initiatives will be more appropriate.

Secondly, there are many people like myself who are staunchly pro-life, but who also support state-funded initiatives for mothers and children.

So, as popular as the "they are just anti-abortion, not pro-life" meme has become, I don't think it's really accurate. </TEXT>

Enwrought with golden and silver light,

The blue and the dim and the dark cloths

Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.  </TEXT>

After the expulsion from Eden, God placed a cherubim to guard the entrance.

The veil covering the Holy of Holies was patterned (Exodus 26:31-34) with cherubim.

After Christ had made his atonement, the veil of the temple was ripped apart (Matthew 27:51).

<TEXT>  You're taking genetics. Have you taken evolutionary biology?

Last year I took a unit which had 4 weeks on cell biology, 4 on genetics and 4 weeks on evolution, and this year, I'm taking one which has 6 weeks on genetics and 6 on evolution. 

 Darwin couldn't have quantified what natural selection is capable of. He knew nothing of genetics, DNA, etc.

Right, Darwin couldn't have investigated it, which is why the scientific world should have been much more hesitant to accept his ideas. It would have been proper to say "We currently don't know whether the kinds of changes that we see in artifical selection can be extrapolated in the manner you wish to".

I'll pick this up again tomorrow. </TEXT>

When you have the time, would you care to address my claim that the "plastic" view of biology is inadequate?

I have no doubt that Behe's ideas about what natural selection is capable of have flaws in them somewhere, but however flawed they are, they are always going to be better than a 19th century view which contains **no** real attempt at quantifying of what natural selection is capable of , which Dawkins tried to pass off as being adequate in his review of tEoE, and which is repeated in textbooks as being a good argument.

And now I have to go to a genetics lecture! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  . As attractive as the "what good is half an eye" argument is rhetorically, it doesn't hold any water biologically. 

That diagram is an example of **exactly what I was talking about in my initial post**: it lists a few types of eye that are similar at the level of gross anatomy, but does absolutely nothing to show what kind of changes have to occur at the molecular level to build up, say, a lens or cornea.

Neutral intermediates. He assumes deleterious. 

Where does Behe assume that all intermediates will be deleterious? I've never seen him write this.

Furthermore, I don't think Behe "ignores exaptation" at all. See his attempts to reply to critics who put forward the Type III secretory system as a possible precursor for the bacterial flagellum. </TEXT>

Where does he assume this? As I read Behe, what I get from him is that he believes that selection can indeed operate in such cases where there is an increase in fitness, and sometimes, when there are a few neutral steps.

Where do you get the idea that Behe would say that something like cefepime resistance cannot occur? I must ask at this point, have you actually read his books, or just the accounts of his critics? I could be wrong, but it seems to me that you are under the same misimpression that [these critics were](http://behe.uncommondescent.com/2010/02/misusing-protistan-examples-to-propagate-myths-about-intelligent-design/). </TEXT>

I think this is incorrect: he says that it is possible for evolution to produce "end points" that increase fitness that include neutral steps, and the entire chapter "Benchmarks" in his book the Edge of Evolution is given to trying to estimate what the limits of this might be under different circumstances.

Now, do you concede that the textbook is indeed an example of using the

Seen my delicate sweetheart.

I saw her on Sunday,

Standing in front of the door:

That thousand-times beautiful girl,

That thousand-times beautiful heart,

Would, God, I were with her today!

---------

This whole week, my laughing

Has not ceased;

I saw her on Sunday,

Going to church:

That thousand-times beautiful girl,

That thousand-times beautiful heart,

Would, God, I were with her today!

<TEXT>  and 2) explaining a case made by Darwin a century and a half ago.

No, it's not just saying that that's what Darwin said a century and a half ago: if you read the Summary of Key Concepts at the end of the chapter, under the heading  "What is the evidence that populations evolve by natural selection?" it explicitly says 

*"Similarly, many lines of evidence indicate that natural selection is the chief mechanism driving changes in the characteristics of species over time*, **including the following**:

*Rapid, heritable changes have been produced in domestic animals and plants by selectively breeding organism with desired features (artificial selection)."*

(My bolding)

The textbook is clearly putting it forward as an example which is valid to this day, not just as a historical reflection on what Darwin wrote. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Nobody makes those claims in support of Darwinian (or non-Darwinian, because he's a bit out of date at this point) processes. 

Here's a passage from Audesirk and Audesirk's "Biology: Life on Earth" 5th edition under the heading "What is the evidence that populations evolve by natural selection?"

*"Dogs descended from wolves, and even today the two will readily cross-breed. With rare exceptions, however, few modern dogs resemble wolves. Some breeds are so different from one another that they would be considered separate species if they were found in the wild; for instance, see the Chihuahua and the Great Dane in the Chapter 12 opening photo. Interbreeding would hardly be possible without a lot of human assistance. If humans could breed such radically different dogs in a few hundred to at most a few thousand years, Darwin reasoned, it seemed quite plausible that natural selection could produce the spectrum of living organisms in hundreds of millions of years."*

<TEXT> I'm unsure as to why this is a problem, exactly.

Let me recap. Previously, I said that: 

saying "these pieces of evidence are compatible with common descent via the following scenario" is quite a different position to saying "these pieces of evidence support common descent", isn't it?

And you replied "Not really" because science is a paradigm based system in which observations merely being consistent with a theory are helpful.

I agree that observations being consistent with a theory is helpful, but that doesn't show that 

-observations which are likely to be compatible with common descent and other explanations

-observations which are only likely to be compatible with common descent.

aren't two clearly distinct classes.

I fully acknowledge that Gould was making an inductive statement in the quote I gave from him, and I don't think this undermines my point.

Let me restate what I was trying to say:

-PBS presents the near-universality of the standard genetic code, coupled with there being no reason for it being preferable on a biochemical level, as being an observation which is only likely to be compatible with common descent.

-I don't think it is, for the reasons I previously discussed.

<TEXT> I totally agree with you that Gould was saying that common descent is the most *plausible* explanation, rather than the only logically possible explanation. But that's a red herring, I think: it doesn't change that he is still making the distinction between 

- observations which are likely to be compatible with common descent and other explanations

- observations which are only likely to be compatible with common descent.

<TEXT> I guess what I take issue with is something along the following lines

David Swift, an English environmental scientist, writes in his book 'Evolution Under The Microscope': 

*"Darwin, being aware of morphological variations that arise naturally, but knowing nothing of the underlying genetic 
mechanisms or biochemical implications, believed that biological tissues are innately plastic.
Also, from the success of domestic breeding it was evident that variations are heritable
and that significant morphological change can be acheived by repeated (artificial) selection.
In the light of which, Darwin extrapolated that any amount of morphological change can be 
achieved through the selection and accumulation of small beneficial variations. In effect he
believed there was no fundamental limit to the plasticity of biological tissues: morphological
change was limited only by the viability of the resulting structure*

*...Unfortunately, many contemporary biologists, although they are aware of the genetic and biochemical
aspects of variations, still follow the uninformed 19th-century view when it comes to considering
the origin of new morphological structures."*

Let me give a prime example of this: Richard Dawkins' review of Michael Behe's "The Edge of Evolution" in the New York Times.

He writes: *If mutation, rather than selection, really limited evolutionary change, this should be true for artificial no less than natural selection... Behe has to predict that youd wait till hell freezes over, but the necessary mutations would not be forthcoming. Your wolves would stubbornly remain unchanged. Dogs are a mathematical impossibility. [Behe claims] that mutations are too rare to permit significant evolutionary change anyway.* 

But of course, in TEOE, Behe isnt so imprecise as to say that *no* significant evolutionary change is possible: rather, he attempts to give a quantitative measure of complexity in biochemical systems beyond which mutation and selection cannot reach.

When one person writes a book which includes 150 pages in which they delineate the kind of complexity they think processes can produce and give specific examples to attempt to substantiate this, and an expert sincerely thinks that: "Yeah, but wolves change... heaps!" is some kind of devastating and scientifically rigorous rebuttal, I think you begin to see that it something else is going on.

As I see it, Dawkins "Wow! Wolves can be bred into Chihuahuas and Great Danes! Look at that change! Imagine what evolution can do over deep time!" is just as rigorous as, "Wow! Look at how good the stick insect's camouflage is! Look at that intricacy! It just can't have evolved!". That is, not very rigorous at all.

Can you see what I'm getting at?

IIRC, influenza has certain surface proteins which are what is mutated in new strains of the virus. But what is actually happening to them? Is it the kind of thing which demonstrate the power of natural selection to accomplish that which people impute to it? </TEXT>

The bishop visited, and preached on Martha and Mary, the Gospel reading for today. I can't remember a lot of the sermon, but I do remember that he described how we can sometimes structure our lives so that Jesus gets our "spiritual leftovers" which I thought was a good illustration. I mean, I love leftovers but I can still see what he was getting at. 

Hymns were:

Praise to the Lord, the Almighty

<TEXT> "The Mystery of Life's Origin" wasn't written as an ID book; neither was 'Evolution: A Theory in Crisis'. They were both arguments for creationism, specifically calling for the inclusion of a (Christian) Creator

I don't have Mystery on me at the moment, but I can tell you right now that Evolution: A Theory in Crisis is definitely *not* a Christian creationist book. Michael Denton, the author is an agnostic. Have you actually read the book, or are you just repeating this second-hand?

 It was 'designed' by a lawyer (Johnson)

Well, the changes in Pandas and People, and the other examples I mentioned occurred before Johnson wrote Darwin on Trial, so I think your chronology is off. Let me throw another example into the mix: Stephen Meyer, current head of the Discovery Institute's Centre For Science and Culture, got interested in ID and applied to do his graduate studies on the origin-of-life at Cambridge in 1985, well before 1991.

Regarding the Wedge Document, I think the Discovery Institute did a good job in their response [here](http://www.discovery.org/f/349). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  ID is creationism reinvented to use politics to get the Bible into the schools.

I disagree with this narrative, and here's why:

It seems to me that, in the 1980s, a number of thinkers began to emphasise Look, these kinds of arguments from design *can* be decoupled from any particular religious system. Why not just assess them on those grounds?. 

Fred Hoyle, the irreligious English astrophysicist and scientific maverick suggested that abiogenesis was scientifically impossible, and that life arrived on earth by being seeded from outer space. 

*"if one proceeds directly and straightforwardly in this matter, without being deflected by a fear of incurring the wrath of scientific opinion, one arrives at the conclusion that biomaterials with their amazing measure of order must be the outcome of intelligent design."* (Fred Hoyle, Evolution From Space 1981)

In 1986, the Oxford Union held a debate on the proposition That the doctrine of creation is more valid than the theory of evolution. Arthur Wilder-Smith, an English chemist and pharmacologist debating for the creationist side, remarked 

*The scientific creationist says that you need, above natural law, extrinsic information. He does not specify where youre going to get it from. He believes, with Noam Chomsky, that the origin of information, because its a surprise effect, is not attackable by the human brain, and I believe the same. Second thing is that the religious creationist, and I dont speak tonight as a religious creationist, I speak as a scientific creationist, I didnt come here to teach Madame President or anybody else anything about religious creation. I say, from a scientific point of view, you must have, as Hoyle has pointed out, a source of information, surprise effects, acting on inorganic matter in order to do it. The religious creationist says God did it or Allah did it or Yahweh did it or Jesus Christ did it. Im not talking about that, Im saying from a scientific point of view, the scientific method is to add extrinsic information to the system in order to get out an order which isnt intrinsic to inorganic matter.*

In 1984, Lane Lester, Professor of biology at Liberty University, and Ray Bohlin, a doctoral student in molecular biology at the University of Texas, Dallas, published The Natural Limits to Biological Change. While the book was published by Zondervan, a Christian publisher, the first seven chapters of the book merely survey and critique evolutionary biology. The eighth chapter presents Another Alternative. The authors remark *Design in nature has been a topic of debate for centuries. We have no intention of trying to argue conclusively on a philosophic basis that intelligent design disproves any evolutionary theory. Rather, we hope to show briefly by example that the need for intelligence in bringing about the various designs in nature is by no means a preposterous proposition.* They go on to say that, in attempting to describe the limits to biological change, this is *essentially the creationists concept of the created kind.* And I think they argued that simply because their idea fitted in with biblical creationism, didn't mean it was reducible to it.

In 1984, Thaxton, Olsen and Bradley published "The Mystery of Life's Origin", a text widely regarded as a seminal work in the ID movement.

Note that all of these examples are dated *before* Edwards vs. Aguillard in 1987, the case which prohibited the teaching of creationism in the US, and which allegedly was responsible for the modern ID movement according to many. So I don't think this popular narrative of "ID was just designed to get around constitutional requirements after Edwards vs. Aguillard" is quite accurate.

I will concede that there is a lot of conceptual overlap between ID and creationism, and it seems that a creationist textbook ("Of Pandas and People" ) was rejigged to become an ID textbook after Edwards vs Aguillard, but I think that this is just one point of data, and can't be used to characterise the whole issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A [2008 article titled "Reassessing HIV Prevention"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/320/5877/749.full) containtained the following passage under the heading "What works"

"**Reducing multiple sexual partnerships.** Another preventive measure that has had a powerful impact and that could have even greater effect, if it were more widely and assertively promoted, is partner reduction (2, 4, 7, 11, 18, 2325). In Uganda, HIV prevalence declined dramatically following the extensive Zero Grazing campaign of the late 1980s (2, 7, 11, 23). WHO surveys conducted in 1989 and 1995 found a 50% reduction in the number of people reporting multiple and casual partners (11, 2325). In Kenya, partner reduction and fidelity also appear to have been the main behavioral change associated with the recent HIV decline (2, 4, 7). Similar behavior change has been reported in DHS surveys in Zimbabwe, where HIV has also fallen (1, 2, 7, 26), along with Ethiopia (7, 11), Cte d'Ivoire, and urban Malawi (see SOM). In Swaziland, the number of people reporting two or more partners in the past month was halved after an aggressive 2006 campaign focusing on the danger of having a secret lover (7).

There are, however, few demonstrated replicable approaches to reducing multiple sexual partnerships on a large scale. Nonetheless, mass mobilization of the community, as occurred with gay men in the United States and among heterosexuals in Uganda, **can effectively encourage behavior change** (18, 23, 25). And the Ugandan experience suggests that both partner reduction and combating stigma can be successfully achieved (24, 25)."

(My bolding)

Now, this section was addressing multiple partnerships, rather than abstinence, but I think it's clear that the mantra about human sexuality we hear endlessly repeated in Western culture ("people will just do the same thing no matter what you say, only 'harm reduction' is effective") really isn't accurate. </TEXT>

- In the Torah, the death penalty was never recommended for people who happened to have bad eyesight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to one tale, he fought Jannes and Jambres, the magicians of Pharaoh.

"Apart from their opposition to Moses there are other legends about these two Egyptian sorcerers; it was said that during the end of their days they had necessary occult knowledge to embark on a journey to the Judeo-Christian heavens. They were not welcomed and the angels of the first few heavens fought them vigorously but they could not evict them due to the potent talismans that were worn by the wizards. As they entered the fourth heaven they were met by Michael and Gabriel; legends say that the battle was very evenly balanced, but in the end it was the angels who had to fall back. Upon entering the fifth heaven they were met by none other than Metatron, who did not come at them with defiance or anger, but appeared accommodating, considering the circumstances; after conversing for a short time the angel was successful in convincing Jannes and Jambres to remove their talismans, leaving them thus vulnerable. Metatron was quick to act and threw them out of heaven with a wave of his hand. It is said that they lost all memory of the event after that."

<TEXT>  Somehow every orthodox Jew I've ever met is aware of this in the Hebrew Bible, 

I thought that Orthodox Jews believe that the Torah was given by God Himself. Wouldn't that imply that it's not a mere human creation with the kind of cacophony you are talking about? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking personally, I agree that novelty is present here, but doesn't any mutation which affects phenotype cause a "novel trait" in some sense?

The trait in question certainly could also confer increased fitness in some circumstances to E. coli, but again, I don't really have a problem with this.

You say "this is the kind of thing that creationists say can't happen". You may well be right that some creationist laypeople are skeptical that mutations can produce novelty and increased fitness, I strongly suspect that this idea isn't advocated by organisations like AIG or CMI. Similarly, if you take somebody like Mike Behe, who holds to evolution, but is skeptical of the power of the kinds of mutation we see in the lab to build up biochemical features, he certainly doesn't claim that mutation can't cause novelty or increased fitness.

So that's why I think the level the question should be addressed at is whether the example involves actually building up new biochemical machinery.

<TEXT>  That experiment also demonstrated the evolution of a novel, complex trait: One of the lines evolved the ability to metabolize citrate

Isn't it the case that:

- Wild type E. coli already possesses a citrate transporter, but only expresses it under anaerobic conditions. 

- the "novel complex trait" of the Cit(+) strain [was caused by a mutation of a regulatory sequence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22992527) which caused the transporter to also be expressed under aerobic conditions, and doesn't involve building up new biochemical machinery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello again.

Are you now arguing that minds don't exist, or that they're supernatural?

No, I was just pointing out that ID proponents have often phrased the issue as being about how an immaterial mind wouldn't be within the definition of "natural" that some would accept. Personally, I'm not sure the natural/supernatural distinction is that easily defined.

who or what is the designer,

I suppose the only possible candidate would be either an alien of some kind, or humans that time-travelled.

what's the mechanism?

The physical motion of the designer to produce the effects in question? I.e. like how you pressed your fingers on a keyboard to write your previous comment.

You've asserted that this isn't the case, but have not offered an alternative explanation for these facts. What's the alternative explanation?

After further thought, I think I'm willing to concede that the catalyst for the changes in Pandas was Edwards vs Aguillard. I just think that it's an unbalanced view to take this one piece of evidence, and then ignore all the other pieces that I presented. </TEXT>
