<TITLE> Something Weird is Happening in My House </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 18:12:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First time posting to r/nosleep. I usually just read in the background but events have been happening that have compelled me to share my story. I feel like I'm losing my mind and this is the only place I can lay it all out and not be judged.

My family used to live in a home out in the middle of the country, one we built ourselves from the ground up. As we got older and more involved in school activities, my parents decided it was time to move closer to town. Six years ago we moved into our current home, a 150+ year old farm home, the first built in my town. Rumor has it that the founder of my hometown built the house where he kept slaves throughout his time on the grounds. Needless to say, the house has history. From the outside it's what you would expect...Amityville meets American Gothic. Tall, menacing and old looking, it's a real gem. The strangest part is the basement. The basement has all the original stonework and everything from when the house was built, you can see still notches in the walls from where the slaves were kept. For a history geek, it's actually pretty cool.

Once we moved into the house, my parents finally said that we could get a dog. The biggest argument against getting one was tearing up a new home. Now that we had moved into an older home (which we had still done renovations to) my parents decided we could get a puppy. Weeks went by with the new puppy and we had finally mastered potty training and all that, letting him freely roam the house. My bedroom is upstairs, if you go up our stairs and turn around, the door is right at the end of the hallway, essentially being able to stand halfway up the stairs and peer into my doorway through the banisters. One day, our puppy was roaming around upstairs and I heard him growling at something. Wondering if he had found a mouse, I creeped up the stairs and peered into my door way. I could see him glaring into my room and growling, fur raised up and tail between his legs. Finally, something started him and he yelped and ran back downstairs, not even noticing me. Since that day he has still not went back upstairs. My sister was originally in the room. However, she was having nightmares while in there. She would continually talk about "scary eyes" in the room. My parents brushed it off as childhood imagination and I switched rooms with her.

Fast forward a couple years. Strange things tend to happen throughout my house (doors closing, lights turning on and off, etc) but being a rational person, I always found a logical explanation for what was happening. Either a draft in the house, power surges, anything. All throughout this time I was having problems sleeping, feeling like something was always in the room with me. You know that feeling when you can just tell another presence in the room. I was always able to brush it off and head to sleep. However, I would always wake up screaming in the middle of the night, sweating, etc. This went on for awhile until last fall when things escalated.

I've always had problems with sleep. My brain doesn't want to fully fall asleep so I will constantly wake in this pseudo sleep-state and be so confused, babbling nonsense, tearing up my room, etc. Last fall I began sleepwalking which was a new addition to my fantastic sleep skills. The first few times were nothing, I would wake up outside my bed, sitting up, etc. However, things started to get out of hand. One night I woke up and was starting outside my bedroom window, the only thing that woke me up was some sort of jolt that scared the shit out of me. That would happen repeatedly until I eventually woke up in front of my door, which I keep closed at night. I mentioned these sleepwalking episodes to my parents and they dismissed it as just my usual sleeping issues, nothing major. Little did they know it would tear our family apart for months to come.

It started with the banging. My parents room is directly below mine and being a clubfooted Claude, they always knew when I was out of my bed. Dismissing it as just another sleepwalking episode, they normally would go right back to bed. However, they became concerned when they would hear repeat thumping upstairs, almost as if I was jumping up and down in my room. Fearing I would hurt myself, my Mom convinced my father to check on me. When he walked into the room, he told me I was sitting up in my bed but had never actually gotten out. My eyes were wide open but I was perfectly awake, sweating as if I was scared of something. He slowly laid my back down and that was the end of that night. However, this process would happen at least twice a week for a few months.

Then things escalated, I would wake up on the stairs, then at my front door until eventually, my parents found me standing at the entrance to my basement. The only reason they knew that I was out and about was because my screaming woke them up. My mother has raised four kids, she knows what screaming is like. She claims that this screaming was unlike anything. It transcended from a normal scared scream to a scream of desperation, someone screaming for help but hearing nothing in return. All the while, my eyes were wide open but I was sound asleep. At this point my entire family is awake and wondering what is going on. Luckily they are able to get me back to my bed and all was well. The very next night, my parents were woken to the same screaming. This time, however, I had made my way to the basement. My parents would later tell me that I was standing against one of the walls, faced pressed up against the concrete, screaming and rambling gibberish they have never heard of. They could tell that I had been clawing at my neck, as I had scrapes and cuts all along my neck as if I was clawing at my own skin. After that night, they had had enough and sent me to a doctor for some help. I was put on some medicine to help the sleepwalking and all was fine until a couple weeks ago.

I got myself my own puppy and have been having her sleep in my bed with me, my parents thought that it would be a good idea if I were to ever sleep walk again that she would wake me up. This actually worked insanely well, she would sleep by my side and I never once work up. I don't know if it was the heavy sleeping medication or just having her but something was working. Last week she started growling into my closet again, just like my last dog. I would tell her no and she would calm down, never taking her eyes off the door. Two nights ago I was jolted out of bed by my parents...I had been screaming again and my dog had been sitting at the foot of my bed barking and growling at my closet. This time however, my parents found me inside the closet, scrapes all along my neck just like the basement. The only thing that I can remember from this last episode is peering into some darkness and seeing two eyes looking at me. Not glowing eyes, not red eyes, just two normal, blue eyes. Something about them made me nervous. A calming feeling but also something of alarm. Trusting but also dangerous. 

Let's hope that I can get some sleep here soon or get something figured out, I'm tired.

<TEXT> Hello everyone! I also posted this to r/jobs but I figured I would try here also, you guys and gals are the best.

Just a FYI, you're dealing with an extremely nervous/anxious person so you've all been warned. 

Here's the deal...I've been working for a public accounting firm for about two years now. During that time I've done primarily state government audits, two of which I've been the in-charge on. For the sake of anonymity I won't say which state. As great of a time I've had at the firm I'm at, I am ready to move on. As luck would have it, an accounting position opened up at a state agency. I applied for it and received a letter in the mail for an interview shortly.

My mother already works for the state so I was aware of the whole process. To help matters, her boss (significantly higher up at the state) knew my interviewer and put in a good word for me. My interview was last Wednesday (April 5th)...I'm a very good interviewer and I know it went well, we laughed and joked and went about our way. She stated during the interview that the process takes about 4-6 weeks...a person would either get a letter in the mail saying they were not selected or would receive an email regarding background check information. The next day, Thursday, April 6th I received an email requesting my information for a background check. All last week I received calls for a drug test, fingerprinting, they contacted my local police departments to check my record, you name it. I have no criminal history, no firings, not a terrible credit report but no gold standard (I'm a 24 year old with student debt). One thing they wanted was to talk to my current employer. I directed them towards out HR department and all was well. I received a call from the individual in charge of the background check saying they needed more information so I gave them a previous boss (who worked for the same firm) and they were to contact her.

Fast forward to today. I called the person in charge of the background check to make sure she had everything, as she had not yet contacted my old boss (I keep in touch with him and asked him...nothing). She replied "we have all the information, I will let you know if we need anything else." Feeling nervous as I haven't heard anything one way or the other, my mother asked her boss what he thought and he said it was all a very good sign, as they normally don't go through this process for all candidates as it's rather expensive for the whole process. 

So what do you all think? I really, really want an offer as this would be such a big step up from my current position. I'm extremely nervous about it as I had to tell one of the partners at my firm (who was very understanding) about the process as they wanted to contact the firm I work for. Now I feel like if I don't get it I'm going to be in a bad light at the firm, regardless of what they really say. And I realize this Wednesday will only be two weeks from my interview but like I said, super nervous here. 

Thanks everyone! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey thanks! The 1,800 came from a re-calculation...I'm wondering if I need to do a larger deficit to shock my body a little...

It's actually a pretty funny story, I was seeing a personal trainer and he got let go from the gym (a totally bullshit reason but that's too long to explain here) and he taught capoeira on the side. I didn't want to abandon him because we had became friends so I joined capoeira. That was last March and I've loved it ever since. I am nowhere near agile or flexible but I still find things I love doing and it pushes me in ways I never would have thought. I highly suggest giving it a go!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello everyone!

I feel like I'm stuck in a huge rut lately...I went from 331 down to 228 and now I've been stagnant since October. Here's a quick run-down of my routine:

Monday, Wednesday - Weight lifting coupled with cardio.
Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday - Rest.
Friday, Saturday - Capoeira. 

I'm normally eating around 1,800 calories completely plant based. My protein levels are very high so that's not an issue. I'm burning close to 3,500 calories a day.

So what's going on...is this just something I need to wait and break through or am I doing something wrong? My goal is to be below 200lbs but god dammit it's frustrating hitting this big of a road block.

Thanks everyone!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello everyone!
Meet Annie, my 11 week old, 21lbs little terror! 

http://imgur.com/a/VFJuV

Her Dad is a golden doodle and her Mom is a golden lab and she's 100% adorable. I work every day and thus, have put her in doggy daycare so she can get some running around as well as a chance to socialize with other dogs.
For first two weeks she was in daycare, she would run out of my arms to get inside in the morning she would run into my arms at night, lick me to death and we would leave. Recently, she still runs inside in the morning and runs to me at night but has also begun whining when I pick her up and for the first few minutes after we leave. Is she crying because she doesn't want to leave or crying because she's happy to be leaving? I don't want her hating it there and crying because she's essentially so happy to be gone haha.
Thanks! </TEXT>

I'm taking her to doggy day care, hopefully that's enough to satisfy your pretentiousness.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone,

Very inexperienced gay guy here, only been with one guy in my 23 years on this earth. The guy and I have hooked up consistently on the DL all throughout our junior high years up until now...he's getting married so that's coming to an end. 

He had a freaking gorgeous dick. The kind you can just stare at and tear up. The Meryl Streep of dicks truly. Probably about 7-8 inches and fairly thick. I'm a total bottom and he was a total top, we fit together perfectly. I didn't hate bottoming for him but sometimes did not enjoy it. It hurt like hell and it was pretty rough sometimes. Regardless a few times it felt amazing and I loved it and all that jazz. 

Fast forward to now, I've met a new guy. So nice, so sweet, good looking, treats me well everything fuck it's great. We haven't hooked up yet but ya boy is thirsty so I know it's coming. There's one problem: he's sporting about a 5 inch, average dick. This is such a stupid question I can't believe I'm asking it. I KNOW bottoming will feel different but will it be to the point I feel nothing?! Please someone tell me they got the 5 inch or lower dick train and it was great PLEASE. I promise I'm not a size queen I just want to make sure everything works fine for us getting nasty.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey gaybros, sorry this is going to be a book.

I'm 23 years old and have been a closeted gay my entire life...I'm 100% bottom but very masculine which hides it well for the most part. I've dated and had sex with women and it's never worked out. I've been with one guy my entire life and have done everything imaginable with him. It started out in high school and has went clear up until now, all in secret. He's getting married and I simply can't do that with a married man so I've been on Grindr trying to find someone to scratch the itch per say. 

Well I met a guy on Grindr who is tall, handsome, extremely nice to me, very masculine, total top, good job...the entire package. He's out to everyone and looking for a relationship which is the only problem. I've been toying around with the idea of coming out for awhile but let me rant for awhile. 

I'm not sure how my parents will take it. I live with them and I know they would never kick me out but I can't shake the feeling they will hate me and the situation. A couple months ago I went through a bout with depression (caused in part by my closeted ways) and my dad made the comment to my grandma, who made the comment to me that maybe I was "gay and too afraid to tell him" and that if that was the case to say something.  So I'm thinking he has a clue and would be fine, my mother I have no idea. Then I'm also worried about other people's idea of me once I come out, potential people who I could lose in the process, etc. I still find the idea of a relationship with a guy to be strange and foreign but I could chalk that up to only being with a booty call my entire life. I have this feeling of shame in my mind that for some reason I'm supposed to get married, have kids and be a typical story but I know deep down that's not what I want. 

Basically I'm wondering if any of you have been in a similar process and if so, please help me, I'm losing it here.  </TEXT>

As someone who changed their life with weight loss, goes to the gym regularly, gets regular sleep, eats well and still battles anxiety and depression issues I can say I'm disappointed in you for your comments. Not all mental illness is the same and yes, there are those who abuse medication and use it as a crutch. However, there are some of us who have tried all options and it's our only shot at having a normal, healthy life. </TEXT>

However, I will say there are two sides to the coin, you can have a really damn good personal trainer and I've seen some absolute shit ones. If that's an avenue you want to go down I say go for it 100%, just make sure you get a trainer who 1) knows what they are talking about and 2) cares about pushing you towards your goals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I only trained about three months before I did this one and actually felt totally fine. My biggest recommendation for anyone training for a tri is to get the swim down. Swim well over the distance you're going for and make sure to swim in open water a couple of times before the race. The swimming was by far one of the most physically and mentally demanding events of my life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey loseit! 

Backstory: About a year and a half ago I weighed in at a whopping 331lbs. I was unhealthy, borderline diabetic and worst of all - severely depressed. After contemplating suicide a few times I decided to take back my life and never looked back. Since then I've lost roughly 118lbs and have never felt more alive/happier. This past week I ran my first ever triathlon and loved every minute of it! 

Progress pic: http://imgur.com/fq1WNW0

 I love skimming through here and seeing all the progress pictures and posts so I figured I would lump mine into here too! Keep up the good fight everyone! Battle those demons in your head and beat the ever living piss out of them, they are the only thing standing between you and your goal!

I was keto for about a year into my weight loss journey before it started harming my body. I was lethargic, my recovery time was absolute shit and I could not focus at all. I would go week long periods without having bowel movements, I was burning right through my muscle and was having constantly chest pains.  According to one particular study, " Complications such as heart arrhythmias, cardiac contractile function impairment, sudden death, osteoporosis, kidney damage, increased cancer risk, impairment of physical activity and lipid abnormalities can all be linked to long-term restriction of carbohydrates in the diet."

Simple calories in, calories out. Eat whole foods, nothing processed. Lots of veggies. I switched from keto to a whole foods, plant based diet and have never felt better. I'm killing it in the gym (six session a week. Two weight lifting, four triathlon training), my recovery time is incredible and I feel better than I ever have. However, that's not for everyone. Find something that works for you. 

Here's some studies about low carb diets, also:

<TEXT> I started off my weight loss journey doing keto and got really, really good results. However, after I started really working out hard/training for triathlons, I could feel my body slowing down. I became lethargic, couldn't focus and constantly tired. Don't buy into the myths about the dangers of high carbs. Yes, sugary, processed foods that are high in carbs are obviously not good for you. However, legumes are high in carbs and are great for you. 

I decided to switch to a whole foods, plant based diet recently and it has been the best thing I've ever done. My body feels light, airy and my recovery time in the gym is like never before. I know it's not for everyone but I'm in love. I eat between 100-250g's of carbs and am still consistently losing weight at the same clip I did under a keto diet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello r/loseit!

I have kind of a question/kind of motivation needed post here for you folks. I have been on the downhill slide of weight loss, only have about another 30-40lbs left to go on my already 103lbs loss. I am hitting the gym six days a week: two days doing strength training with a personal trainer, three days training for a triathlon (so lots and lots of cardio) and a day of Capoeira training. My BMR is currently 2,233 according to the scale at my local gym. I'm eating generally around 1,700 calories a day, all whole, plant based foods. My goal: look sexy AF. Muscular and lean. 

I went through a two week stretch where I was in limbo between trainers and didn't really do much weight lifting. However, now I'm back into the strength training mix. I've been weighing myself and consistently have been weighing in around 228lbs for the past one-two weeks. For example, on 3/20 I weighed in at 226.3 with 26.3% body fat. This morning I weighed in at 229 with 24.7% body fat. Therefore, I can contribute a portion of that weight gain to muscle gain which is fine. However, will that weight number begin to fall once I stop gaining noob muscle gains? I'm just getting so disgruntled seeing that number on the scale climb up when I'm consistently eating at a deficit and working my ass off in the gym. My trainer keeps telling me that nothing burns fat like muscle but dammit it's pissing me off.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello all,

Cross posted to r/triathlon.

I am training for my first olympic distance triathlon in May, also my first triathlon ever so I'm very, very pumped. Got all my running gear done, my bike situated, the works.

Here's my current workout schedule before I get to my question:

Sunday - Rest.

Monday - Moderate Swim/Moderate Run.

Tuesday - hour strength training with personal trainer.

Wednesday - Short Swim/Short Bike/Short Run.

Thursday - Moderate Swim/Moderate Bike.

Friday - Hour strength training with personal trainer (AM), one hour Capoeria training (PM).

Saturday - two hour Capoeira training.

By moderate is generally medium-longer distances...this week it was a 0.5M swim followed by a 3.5 run, those distances will gradually increase the closer I get to May obviously.

QUESTION TIME: I am debating taking that Wednesday and making it an additional rest day. I don't want to get burned out and have been consistently sore on that Wednesday workout. Will that extra day off push me back significantly endurance wise or is it necessary? What are your thoughts on rest days during training? THANKS GANG. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Cluster of a Question - Triathlon Training/Strength Training </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-24 01:45:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all,

Just FYI, this question is a total clusterfuck. Let me break down my stats for you: Male, 6 foot even, 224lbs, BMR = 2233, eating around 1,600 calories a day. Goal: look sexy AF.

So I am on the tail end of weight loss, went from 331 last year to my current 224. I have been doing lots of body weight training and have been successfully losing weight/gaining muscle. 

However, one of my biggest goals is building up to an IronMan. It's something I've always dreamt of doing and now I have the body to do it. Therefore, I'm training for a significantly smaller triathlon. Today I swam 0.3 miles, biked 13 and ran 3, burning around 1,400 calories during the three workouts combined, my Garmin Forerunner shows 3,000+ burned on the day. That's great and all but I have one giant worry: burning straight through my muscle I'm gaining through my strength training. Before I go and have an in-depth discussion about this I want your opinion. 

I suppose my question is will the cardio completely wreck all strength training I'm doing? I make sure to eat a builders bar before my workout, drink some aminos during and a shake complete with two scoops of protein immediately following.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-03-15 14:52:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello gang!

So here's the sitch. The past month/month and a half I've been losing weight on average at around 2.9lbs per week which I consider a pretty good clip. However, in the past two weeks it has slowed down significantly. We're talking like 0.4 to no change at all. Basically I'm just wanting advice as to whether this is normal or if there is something wrong with my diet/exercise patterns. 

Diet: I am completely plant based...lots of spinach, tofu, etc. I eat at a strict calorie deficit, my BMR/TDEE are 2,069 and 2,771 respectively and normally I'm eating around 1,500-1,700 calories a day. I avoid all heavily processed/sugary foods and do not drink soda/alcohol at all. Yes, before you even ask, my protein levels are just fine. 

Exercise: I workout six days a week with Sundays as my rest day. Two days a week I work with a trainer for an hour doing body weight/strength training exercises. Two days I'm going Capoeira for an hour/two hours respectively. The other four days I am training for a triathlon so lots of cardio. 

Now keep in mind that this is all extremely strict, I am borderline obsessive over fitness at this point. That's why stepping on the scale and seeing no change is frustrating to say the least. I'm obviously going to keep going but I have a good 30lbs to lose and dammit I need it to happen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this isn't probably something you want to hear but I'm just being 100% honest. A lot of us really harp on the exercise/diet aspects of weight loss and completely ignore the emotional/mental aspect which is just as important, if not even more important than the other two. 

I like to think of weight loss in a sequence:
1. Get your mental health in order. Get your mind in the right place. See a doctor, get some help and get your mind aligned with your body. You will have a voice in your head saying "I can't do this" throughout the whole process, our goal is to make sure we are mentally strong enough to silence that voice every time. 
2. Once your mental health is in check, you will find it much easier to stick to a diet and avoid binge eating. Trust me. Been there, done that.
3. Once your mind and diet are good to go, exercise simply to supplement your body along the weight loss journey. 

TL;DR: Get your mental health in check and the rest will fall into place. :)

<TEXT> Before and after photo: http://imgur.com/T4U4C1W

A year and a half into my lifestyle change, I finally stepped on the scale and was at 101lbs lost. Such an amazing feeling, words cannot even describe it. As I sit here writing I'm in the verge of tears looking back on this journey. I was a fat slob, depressed/suicidal and absolutely zero confidence. Now I'm working out five days a week, doing Capoeria two days a week, completely switched to a plant based diet and just so satiated in life. The confidence hasn't fully came around yet, I still see myself as the fat version when I look in the mirror. I'm sure that will change with time though. Never thought I would be this happy but la dee da, here I am. Only 30lbs to go...a year ago that would have sounded like a ton but now, that's weak sauce baby.

My biggest tip to those just starting out: think of this journey in three parts, tackled in sequence. Mental, Diet, Exercise. Tackle your inner demons so they don't hold you back, get that diet on point and exercise to tone your body. The rest works itself out.  </TEXT>

Cut the diet fad. Eat whatever you want as long as you are within your calorie limits. Screw what some "diet plan" has to say. A very large majority of people who undergo "diets" fail and most gain more weight back after their diet is over.

 However, cutting out bad carbs, fried foods, sugars is always a good plan. Just don't be restricted within the guidelines of what some diet plan found online/in a book tells you to do :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, cross posted to r/vegan and r/veganfitness so if you see this both places don't kill me pls.

I recently made the switch to a vegan diet and everything was running perfectly fine. Been feeling great, killing it in the gym, etc. I'm a 6 foot tall male weighing in at 240. I've obviously been eating at a calorie deficit to lose weight. My gym routine is MWF cardio, TR strength/body training with a trainer. I've been doing great but tonight, something went wrong. I felt drained, lethargic and just terrible. My workout showed also, it was terrible. Worst night I've had in the gym for awhile. 

The night before I slept a solid 8 hours so that's obviously not the case. Therefore, I looked to my diet. Could you all look over it and see if that's what it could have been? My workout began at 5:30pm and the following is my meals throughout the day:

Breakfast (around 6:30): smoothie with 1 banana, 1 tbsp almond butter, 2 tbsp PB2, 1 cup almond milk and 1 tbsp spirulina. Additionally, I had my multi-vitamin and my B12 supplement. 

Lunch (around 11:30): Tempeh chili (tomato juice, tomatoes + jalapenos, tempeh, black beans and vegan mozzarella cheese).

Dinner (around 3:30): Spinach salad (Spinach, chickpeas, brussel sprouts, sweet potato, quinoa with about a 1 tbsp of honey mustard).

All in all I ate perfectly at my calorie, fiber and protein goals. Could it have been timing? Actual food choices, etc. HELP ME PLS.

<TEXT> Hey guys, cross posted to r/vegan and r/veganfitness so if you see this both places don't kill me pls.

I recently made the switch to a vegan diet and everything was running perfectly fine. Been feeling great, killing it in the gym, etc. I'm a 6 foot tall male weighing in at 240. I've obviously been eating at a calorie deficit to lose weight. My gym routine is MWF cardio, TR strength/body training with a trainer. I've been doing great but tonight, something went wrong. I felt drained, lethargic and just terrible. My workout showed also, it was terrible. Worst night I've had in the gym for awhile. 

The night before I slept a solid 8 hours so that's obviously not the case. Therefore, I looked to my diet. Could you all look over it and see if that's what it could have been? My workout began at 5:30pm and the following is my meals throughout the day:

Breakfast (around 6:30): smoothie with 1 banana, 1 tbsp almond butter, 2 tbsp PB2, 1 cup almond milk and 1 tbsp spirulina. Additionally, I had my multi-vitamin and my B12 supplement. 

Lunch (around 11:30): Tempeh chili (tomato juice, tomatoes + jalapenos, tempeh, black beans and vegan mozzarella cheese).

Dinner (around 3:30): Spinach salad (Spinach, chickpeas, brussel sprouts, sweet potato, quinoa with about a 1 tbsp of honey mustard).

All in all I ate perfectly at my calorie, fiber and protein goals. Could it have been timing? Actual food choices, etc. HELP ME PLS.

<TEXT> Hey /u/BluLavender! I began my weight loss journey about a year and a half ago and this sub has been so incredibly useful. Check out the FAQ for some tips and tricks, read it all the way there is TONS of great info in there.

I started with the low-carb diet and instantly had great results. The health effects of a keto diet are pretty up for debate but from a weight loss standpoint it's a good gig to start on. 

If you ever need some accountability or just someone to chat with, message me up. I'm extremely passionate about weight loss/fitness so you will never bother me!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Transitioned to a full plant based diet shortly after reading a few books (Meat is for Pussies/Finding Ultra) and watching a few documentaries (Forks Over Knives, Cowspiracy, Earthlings.) In the beginning I was concerned as I was in the middle of a drastic weight loss/fitness plan and working out heavily in the gym. I've never been happier. I feel lighter, my workouts are 10x better than before, my recovery time is amazing and best of all, I'm losing weight at a faster clip than before. I feel more at peace somehow spiritually and am seemingly happier. It's all starting to mesh and I'm just overwhelmed with happiness. 

I browse this subreddit every day looking for new recipes, advice, motivation, etc. I can't say thank you enough to all of you! Keep fighting the good fight! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Vegan diet. I'm not one to ever bring it up in a public setting/Reddit because I hate the conversation surrounding it. People instantly get defensive and see me as preachy, which I really, really try to avoid. While there are vegans that are your typically preachy whiny types, there are a few outliers of us that aren't. However, people are so quick to jump on the judgment train on here. If I don't judge your diet choice, don't judge mine you fucktwat.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Nervous about carb intake on vegan diet - M/22/245 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-26 18:29:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello r/veganfitness, M/22/245/6ft, first time poster long time lurker. I posted this question to r/vegan and was sent here a few times so here I am!

I have lost about 85lbs in the past year and have recently kicked it into high gear, splitting my MWF into 45-50 minutes of cardio and spending TR with a trainer. On those TR days we hit major muscle groups with a lot of body/weight training. My weight loss has definitely picked up since I started this new routine back in early December. I've noticed a ton of more muscle tone and am losing weight on average about 3lbs a week. My goal is to be just downright nasty fit, a dream I've had my whole life and I can begin seeing a faint glimmer in the distance.

I've thrown around the idea of going vegan/plant based for awhile but never really got into it. Recently read Finding Ultra by Rich Roll/listening to his podcasts and am ready to make the move. However, I have one major concern. I've been eating at a calorie deficit obviously (around 1,500-1,700 a day) and have limited my carb intake to about 20-30g. While looking into a vegan diet I've noticed that a lot of the recipes are very high carb. Now I know these are still very healthy foods that are very fiber rich but the high amount of carbs makes me nervous. Will I still be able to lose a consistent amount of weight on a vegan/plant based diet? I know the ultimate take away is to keep the calorie surplus but dammit the carbs make me nervous, I've always been told to equate high carbs with weight gain. 

TL;DR: Trying to cut, worried about carbs on vegan diet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello r/vegan! I wasn't sure if this post should be included here or r/loseit so I came here! Hope I'm not overstepping my bounds!

 I've lost about 85 pounds within the past year through rigorous diet and exercise. My diet has largely been focused on staying in my calorie limits of 1,500-1,700 calories a day/20g of carbs. My exercise is a five day program, two days doing extensive body/weight training the rest cardio. I've been losing, on average, about 3.2lbs a week. Since I've really got into the fitness mindset I've been reading some fitness/health books, specifically Finding Ultra by Rich Roll and and Meat is for Pussies by John Joseph. I'm fully convinced a vegan diet is the way to go. I'm ready to change.

and I know vegan foods such as whole grains, veggies, fruits, etc are all very, very healthy I get it yes okay. However, most of them are very high in carbs which I try to avoid. My question is, can I switch to a vegan diet and still expect to lose weight at the rate I have been? I know it may seem like a stupid question but that's the only thing holding me back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine's a little darker than going to the zoo but dammit, it really pulled me from where I was. I had always known throughout college that I was gaining weight steadily but I guess never really came to terms with what was really happening. Eventually one night I left a party early. I never felt comfortable in public and quickly became too ashamed/embarrassed of my body to go out. Once I got back to my apartment I had a complete meltdown...started throwing everything in sight, crying hysterically...all over my weight, it had literally taken control of my life. Took a look at myself in the mirror and punched it, cutting my hand all to hell. There was a moment, and I can still remember it, that I contemplated taking a broken piece of mirror to my stomach. That was the night that I changed everything about myself. Since that night I've lost 85 pounds and am well on my way to being healthier and happier than I ever have before. It was an ugly journey but the sun is beginning to shine! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally not a dumb question. For me, my weight fluctuates pretty seriously due to water. It's important to measure your weight loss in averages, not just by the weekly drop you see in the scale. See this article for a good summary: http://greatist.com/health/understanding-scale-bloat-and-weight-loss

 I know it's difficult to wrap your mind around. For example, I weighed myself on 1/10 and weighed 251.7, weighed myself on 1/15 and weighed 252.2. Weighed myself this morning and it was back down to 247.5...water weight is weird. Just continue counting your calories and doing you...the weight will come off. Maybe try other measurements like the article says. I've found my best scale is the mirror truthfully.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey r/fitness! I posted this question into r/loseit but got semi-choppy answers so I figured I would throw it out here to see what you all thought.

After losing about 85 pounds I figured it was time to kick it into high gear to lose the rest of the weight I want to lose, about another 50-60 pounds. I started with a new gym after leaving Planet Fitness and found me a personal trainer. I hit cardio by myself M,W,F for about 40 minutes and do strength/weight training with my trainer T,R for about an hour. Last week I lost about 3 pounds so I was obviously pretty pumped. I've started drinking significantly more water to ward off loose skin/stay hydrated. Additionally, my diet is super strict which I have NEVER swayed from since starting the gym flow back in mid-December. I usually eat at a 1,200-1,300 deficit, filled with meats and lots of veggies. So all is well on that front. 

Got curious yesterday and weighed myself...+1.6 pounds. I thought whatever I'll be fine. The more I went throughout my day the most pissed I got. I've been working my ass off and gained weight, wtf. Weighed myself again today and was still at around +2.0 pounds. 

The good folks over in r/loseit mentioned that it's most likely water weight causing this...either from muscle repair (my legs have been extremely sore since training on Tuesday) and that this was normal. But dammit, I'm looking to see results here! If it really is my muscles retaining water, should that start to decrease after I do my cardio today?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey gang,

So here's the sitch. I'm six foot even and 22 years old. I weigh myself normally every Sunday morning, right before breakfast, butt naked. I have a Fitbit Aria which I am generally pleased with. Last Sunday I weighed in at 250.7, my newest low. Throughout the week I eat at a strict...very, very strict 1,200 - 1,300 deficit, making sure all my macros are in check (protein high/carbs between 20-30g). I also hit the gym hard - M,W,F pure cardio on the elliptical (burnin about 500 calories) and T,R doing weight/resistance training with my personal trainer. So everything seems fine and dandy.

Got curious this morning and weighed myself. I actually gained a pound and a half this week instead of losing wtf. I was so pissed and have incessantly been thinking about it. My guess is water weight but I'm not 100% sure HELP PLS. So depressed over it because I was really hoping to be in the 40's this week.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I started my weight loss journey I was so depressed and filled with self-loathing I couldn't even look at any mirrors. I would lay in bed and cry for most of the morning, cry getting dressed and then put on a smile as I walked out the door. It was the hardest years of my life. However, the best day of my life was when I decided "fuck this, I'm better than this and dammit I can beat it." Once I started losing weight and working out, the depression became a faint little memory in the back of my mind.

<DATE> 2016-01-06 18:19:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> M/22/250, around six feet tall. September of 2014 I started out weighing about 331 and was just absolutely miserable. Started absolutely hating everything about myself. Couldn't look in a mirror, had about two solid shirts that I would wear and up and quit going out with friends because I was so ashamed. I lived on the margaritas and everything else I could fit into my mouth diet. One day I woke up, looked at myself in the mirror and had a complete breakdown. After that I decided to turn my life around and live to the age of 30. Truthfully, and this will sound stupid but I saw this picture of Chris Pratt and it really, really hit home (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/f9/29/dcf9299bbaa0efdfb73b73e69ee9dff8.jpg)

Started by writing literally everything I ate down in a journal while also keeping track on my phone. I was a big guy but consistently ate around 1,500 calories a day and between 30-50g of carbs. At the hell out of chicken, kale and eggs. I would walk for an hour every day at an incline and saw dramatic changes. 

Progress pic: http://imgur.com/xFiq3R4

Fast forward to now, I've went down three pant sizes and two shirt sizes, dropping down to about 250lbs. I recently started with a personal trainer. He has me doing a mix of resistance/weight training with some weighted cardio mixed in. I meet with him two days a week and do strict cardio by myself on the other days. My ass is getting handed to me and I absolutely love it. My goal is by June to be at my goal weight and looking sexy af. I'm nowhere near where I want to be yet but dammit I'm a hell of a lot closer than I was a year ago. Now it's crunch time.

Point of the story, I know it's around the time for New Year's resolutions and jokes are being made about packed gyms but dammit it's nothing to joke about. If you are one of those people struggling to lose weight don't give in, keep it up. Don't think of it as a diet, think of it as a lifestyle change. Don't be embarrassed to ask for help/advice...nobody is going to judge someone actively trying to better themselves. Set goals and crush them...be a fucking lion. In the beginning it will seem like absolute hell until you start to see results, then it becomes an addiction. I promise you, if I could crawl out of the hole I dug myself, so can you dammit.

<TEXT> Well the training he has me doing is a blend of exercises, mostly aimed at muscle growth but a lot of fat burning mixed in also. Not worried about that portion because I'm seeing positive change. I just need to get my damn diet down, if you would have told me a year ago I would have problems not eating enough I would have punched someone hahaha </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi gymbros,

I'm a six foot, 22 year old male weighing in at 250. Lost about 80 pounds over the course of a year and recently have started working with a trainer doing resistance/weight training. All in all I work out about three days a week for an hour each. The goal is losing fat/gaining muscle...essentially a body recomp.

My problem is my diet. When I started with him I was eating about 1,500 calories and he obviously told me I needed to bump that up. However, since I started working out with him I can barely eat anything at all, I simply have no desire to eat. I can barely throw down breakfast in the morning and I have been sitting here trying to eat my lunch for an hour. I know I need to be eating enough calories but at this point I could eat less than 1,000 a day and be totally fine, which is obviously no bueno.  Is this normal in the beginning/what can I do to help get some appetite back. Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I posted some variations of this question awhile back on reddit and didn't really get any answers that seemed solid so I figured I would ask again and be a little more in-depth with my question.
Backstory: I'm a 22 year old male at exactly six feet tall. At the end of September of 2014 I weighed in at 331 and thought "fuck I'm going to die a fatass." Therefore I tackled the issue head on and changed my diet/exercised. I was eating around 1,500 calories a day and keeping the carbs below 50g, all while doing intense cardio three-four times a week. Here's some before and after pic http://imgur.com/xFiq3R4

Fast forward to today and I weigh 250lbs and have started with a personal trainer. We went over my goal which is to obviously be around the 190-200lb range and be sexy af. Now before I beg the question I just want to say that yes, I trust my trainer and yes, I know that I'm paying him this money and should be trusting him but dammit...I just need more than one confirmation here. I'm a man obsessed and just want to be 100% with my plan.

The plan with my trainer is I meet with him two days a week for about an hour, doing resistance weight training. We typically hit every muscle group from legs to arms and I build up a pretty decent sweat. He has me eating around 2,000-2,400 calories a day, keeping my carbs low and protein high. He says with the workouts we are doing and what we plan to do, I will be able to build muscle and burn fat.

So the question is...will this plan work for me? I'm just so nervous to switch up from what I was doing but I know weight training is so important. I know doing this will help my health in the long-run obviously but dammit I just want to look hot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Backstory: started in September of 2014 at 331, now down to 250lbs about 6 foot even. I have seen major progress but now want to take it a step further. I was eating around 1,500 calories a day and less than 50g of carbs, doing a straight hour of cardio every day at the gym. I was just becoming a smaller version of my already fat self and visibly losing muscle tone. 

I want to totally re-shape my body to have less fat/more muscle. I want to be healthier, want to wear clothes I want and dammit I just want to look good. I read on here/heard several times that resistance training eventually needs to be added into a routine to gain muscle...duh. Unfortunately, I had no god damn clue what I was doing. So, I went and got a personal trainer. 

Fast forward to now, been working out with the trainer for a couple weeks. Simple resistance/weight training eventually leading to more intense workouts. When we started going over my diet, he looked at my BMR (2,405) and said I should be eating at least 2,400 on the days when I'm not at the gym and 3,000 on the days when I go the gym and at least 250g of protein. I feel like this is a ton of calories compared to my usually 1,500 and truthfully, I'm scared of eating that much and gaining my weight back. HELP ME for I am dumb and no nothing. 

Edit: looking to be in the 190-200 range by the end of it all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I figured with my proten shakes I drink + meals throughout the day I could get into the 150 range so that's great...don't know if I can push for the extra 100 though that's a stretch.  </TEXT>
