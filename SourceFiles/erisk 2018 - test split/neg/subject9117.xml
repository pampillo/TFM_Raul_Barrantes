In the current study, the investigators have moved to an in vivo model. Mebendazole has not yet been approved to use for off-label purposes.

Since these results are so novel, I don't think the authors wanted to speculate too much on the mechanism of action, but if the data holds up in larger studies I'm certain that will be the next path researchers go down.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the pH portion is only within the realm of fiction as the body tightly regulates pH and minor fluctuations can cause serious issues or  even death.
HOWEVER! ;) Malaria was used to treat syphilis. more specifically neuro-syphilis (when the bacteria infects the brain). Julius Wagner-Jauregg won a Nobel prize in 1927 for this, in what was titled Malariotherapy. This technique fell out of favor due to the high death rate associated with it and the development of antibiotics. The theory was briefly resurrected during the height of the AIDS epidemic as it was thought the HIVvirus would bee sensitive to the extremely high fevers associated with malaria parasitic infections...this obviously turned out to not be true.

<TEXT> No worries ;) I did a lot of research in malaria so  I always love discussing it! Artemisinin actually also works against Schistosoma (blood flukes), which are parasitic flatworms. Unfortunately, the method of action for Artemisinin is still not fully understood, but the most widely held theory is that it somehow interferes with the parasite's ability to break down heme (iron molecule) that it accumulates from digesting blood. This would be consistent with Schistosoma as well.

<TEXT> The significance is kind of two-fold. First is sort of obvious from a commercial development standpoint...developing desirable flavors of marijuana for resale (in places where it is legal of course ;). But you could envision another scenario where a range of desirable flavors could be offered to patients who may be using the drug for pain management or appetite stimulation.
I'm not a cannabis expert, so  I dont know for certain the answer to the second part of your question. However, the based on how the paper is worded it would lead me to believe that the female plants produce much more of the compounds.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I think it's going to take a bit of time to independently validate the results of this study. Yet, if they hold up, then samples for the test could theoretically be obtained either in doctors office (blood draw) or through a direct to consumer kit (think 23andMe).    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't classify it as retrospective. the authors are drawing upon known information about potential metabolic biomarkers and applying novel computational algorithms to determine if they can be used as a potential diagnostic tool. I grant you that 83 subjects is not a very large cohort, but it's a nice size to provide proof of concept. Proper controls were utilize for this analysis..but a large, double blind study will tell the real tale. I'm sure that is where they are looking to tsake this next.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think that the authors would advocate using this analysis as the sole source of diagnosis, in its current state. Given that there haven't been any reliable metabolic biomarkers to date, this a positive first step, but still has a way to go to be used on a regular basis within the clinic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, the PPI's are the latest and greatest meds for GERD and upper GI issues. I would hazard a guess that since you didn't see much relief after weight loss, that the issue is a genetic abnormality that may not be rectified even with dietary restrictions. Hopefully, something will come around the pike for you soon that provides relief and has better long term outlooks.
