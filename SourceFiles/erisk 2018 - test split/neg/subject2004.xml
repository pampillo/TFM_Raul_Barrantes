<TEXT> Hi. I have just the rub you are looking for. I use it on beef, chicken, pork,...anything but seafood. Equal parts salt and pepper, half measure of coffee, paprika and garlic powder, quarter measures of brown sugar, sage and cayenne. You can also add chilli powder if you want, or sub the coffee for cocoa powder. 

I didn't use sage for this one but I put it in pretty much all of mine now. https://imgur.com/gallery/D1Kr8 </TEXT>

Even in school I always wondered if girls found me ugly, no matter how many compliments or dates I got. I try to hide it though, cause I know it's annoying.

<TEXT> I was just talking to my buddies about this the other night. We were in Vegas, I decided to wear these new jeans that I bought when we went out. I've been buying the exact same cut of jeans for over 10 years. Relaxed fit, boot cut. They're not too baggy, but give the right amount of room for the dangly bits. So I slid them on, and right around when they got to my thighs I said "Fuck". Pulled them the rest of the way up, the waist was fine but the crotch seam literally was squished between my nuts. Every time I took a step, the balls would go from one side to the other. So in a fit of rage, I took the jeans off, put cargo shorts on, and threw the jeans back in my bag to return them.

I go back into the store with said pants this morning, and told the girl "Yo, these jeans are riding high, wtf." All she could tell me is that they've been adjusting the seam height or some shit recently and a lot of people have been complaining about squished ball syndrome. I am very distraught now, as they were the only company left who's jeans felt like they were not squeezing the life force out of my dick/balls. I'm 6'3" and 200lbs. I work out. I cannot wear skinny jeans, I cannot wear slim fit jeans, I cannot wear straight leg jeans. I've tried Guess, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, True Religion, Abercrombie, Levis, Etc. At this point, all that's left is wickedly expensive jeans or trucker jeans from wal-mart.

<TEXT> I did something pretty stupid with I was 22. I had just moved to a town in a Midwest, didn't know anyone. I always found that a good way to meet girls was in clothing stores (at least on my experience). Anyways I went to an old Navy to buy a couple shirts, asked a girl for my size and she recognized that my accent was not from there so we started talking.

She was not attractive. At least 40 pounds overweight, really short hair which I'm not into, but she was nice. Anyways, she asked for my phone number and offered to show me around town. I was hoping that she had hot friends (douchebag move, I know) so I gave it to her. A few hours later she started texting me.

At this point I was laying on my air mattress enjoying some battlefield so I was giving short dismissive answers to her questions. She asked if I wanted to hang out, I said no. Then she said she would suck my dick if I could get there in 10 minutes. I responded with "lol nah." So then she tells me she just really wants to suck my dick, and if I leave right after she won't be mad. By this point my dick was like "bro WTF, let's go." 

So I hopped in the car, drove to her place, literally opened the door and she undid my pants and led me to her bedroom. Sucked my dick, swallowed, did my pants back up and I dipped. Never talked to her again. That town was fire though... So many hot women in a small place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been trying to get my boss to let me work from home for 5 months. There's literally nothing I do that can't be done from home. But they say no, every time. The reason? "The office provides a better working environment." So I get to drive 45 minutes every day, sit on the couch in my office and play on my laptop while I brainstorm and get interrupted every 30 minutes by the new girl asking me how to do things. Sound logic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really is. And interestingly, drug problems are increasingly being linked to boredom. So if you're creating areas where you can live AND have fun without having to travel very far, if it all. I've got an area close to my house where there's 100 or so apartments, a dog park, half a dozen restaurants, a little movie theater, etc... Everything is surprisingly pretty affordable too. I think that's the direction the towns in Maine need to move in, so that everyone doesn't migrate South.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'd be surprised what these new economic development counsels can do once they set a plan in motion. Look up Deep Ellum in Dallas, or the Bishop Arts district. 5 years ago they were areas I wouldn't ever go to and I'm a big guy who can defend himself. Now? There's dog parks, food trucks, concert venues, etc. It was a complete night and day transformation.

At some point I'll come back home and I plan on taking part in a few revitalization projects. It honestly just takes a few competent people to change the situation, especially if you've got a foundation to build from which Lewiston does have believe it or not. </TEXT>

We go for my birthday and I tell everyone to bring their best friend. Last year there were almost 20 of us. The year before that my we lost my friend and he came back to us the next day minus all of his personal belongings, but unharmed. He said he woke up naked being put on a gurney by EMT'S in the back hall of Caesers Palace. He escaped the hospital in nothing but a gown and those slipper socks and made his way back to the hotel on foot. We still aren't sure what happened to him.

The year before that, our friend Dusty went out to try and find cocaine to experiment with and came back 2 days later with no money and only one sock on. Las Vegas brings out the best in people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the most realistic situation is to end up trading Wes and the Mavs pick for a higher pick, and trying to draft Monk, Fultz or Fox. The great thing with this draft is that it's heavy on guards, which Dallas is in desperate need of. If the starting lineup could be Curry, Fultz, Barnes, Dirk and Noel, I think that puts them right back into contention. Optimally they'd sign another big like Griffin or Ibaka and bring Dirk off as a 6th man but that's not going to happen. </TEXT>

So I had to ride to the hospital with no bottoms on. Oddly enough the doctor that delivered me as a baby also removed said fish hook and performed two surgeries on my leg after I broke it. His famous line which I'm sure all kinds of doctors use was "You're all set kid, I hope I never see you again." I feel like I disappointed him many times growing up. Thanks Dr. Hershey!  </TEXT>

Before anyone asks... Broken arm at 3, fish hook stuck in my ass at 4 requiring surgery, fractured skull at 7 after getting power bombed onto a treadmill by my older brother while wrestling, dislocated shoulder at age 8 from being pulled off of a tree limb, broken ribs at age 9 from falling off my trampoline, dislocated shoulder from basketball at age 11, broken middle finger and torn ligament from basketball at age 12, broken leg, dislocated shoulder and broken wrist at age 14 from atv accident, broken leg at age 16 from basketball, torn rotator cuff at age 17 from basketball, broken thumb and pinkie at 18 from basketball, broken foot from kicking a door frame trying to run too fast at age 20, broken ribs and torn cartilage from having legs taken out in a basketball game at age 21, broken and dislocated thumb at 22 from basketball, torn mcl from jumping into the shallow end of a pool drunk at age 23, torn rotator cuff and labrum at 23 from basketball, gallbladder removal at 27, hereditary. Add an extra 3 broken toes and 5-6 concussions from other sports incidents over the years.

So yeah....I don't like pain anymore and I enjoy staying in low risk situations. Edit: forgot one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I became a lakers fan mostly because of Kobe, Eddie Jones and Shaquille. I've seen some shit. There's no denying that we've been in a terrible spot for the last few years(Kobe contract...it was bad guys, Moz, Deng, Pringles, Hamburgular, etc)but I really do feel like everything is trending upwards after this year. The last season was very encouraging, even though a lot of people in the sub were beating themselves up as the losses kept coming. But remember, we started 10-10 and finished the season on a great winning streak. Luke was getting his feet wet, Ingram was getting his confidence, everyone was continuing to try and gel.

Along the way a few things became clear. Randle, Russell, Ingram, Zubac and Nance are our most valuable contributors going into next season. That leaves Clarkson as either a 6th man or a valuable piece to a team that we can package with Deng or Moz. There's too many different scenarios to go over as far as the roster goes but it's clear to me that we will hold on to most of the players that I listed above. They all have great potential, with Randle and Nance probably being the closest to their ceiling, which is fine.

The average age of our core is 21.6 years. Extremely young! We have nowhere to go but up. We won 9 more games compared to last year, with a new head coach and a ton of changes in the middle of the year. I honestly think we are 1 piece away from the playoffs. With the continued maturity of our roster and another offseason together, we should win at least an extra 5-6 games next season with no roster changes. If we can get ahold of a couple consistent role players and a primary scoring weapon to help out with Ingram and Russell, we will be pretty dangerous. We don't need Blake Griffin or Chris Paul. Kevin Durant isn't walking through that door. If we keep our pick, that's obviously best case scenario but if we lose it there are still some attractive options at shooting guard or point guard, which are our biggest needs, along with needing some depth at Center.

I think the biggest priorities will be convincing Nick Young to come back on a team friendly deal, trying to get rid of Deng or Moz(hopefully both), and filling in the other holes with experienced vets that won't break the bank. We've got a very realistic shot at the 8th seed next season if we keep our pick and get Monk or Ball. I personally don't think it's gonna happen but it would be nice. But regardless of the pick, we still have a shot and something to look forward too, which we haven't been able to say since 2012. So let's stop arguing with each other and get excited for 2017-2018! Who are some players you'd like us to target in free agency? Who should we draft? Let's talk and get hyped! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I listen to a great podcast and they cover this question about bears and cougars pretty frequently. The reason some predators seem very skittish is because they're opportunists, and they do a cost/benefit analysis when they're coming after prey. It's why babies and old animals always get eaten first. Predators don't WANT a fight unless they absolutely have to. If they're outnumbered or the "prey" is acting all crazy it makes the predator re think it's decision to attack. Any good survival coach will tell you to scream and yell at most bears, and never try to run. If you're in an area with cougars, wear a mask on the back of your head (yes it works), cause those fuckers like to come from behind or above. But generally, just make a lot of noise and you'll scare off most stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh ok, you're close to Mars Hill then. That used to have a good basketball team back when I played, not sure how it is now but the high school sports were always pretty entertaining if you're looking for something to do. You should also look into field gleaning. It's a good way to get free or cheap produce from the farmers after they've harvested. There's also lots of fiddleheads (edible baby ferns), wild apples, berries in the fall, etc. The hunting is bad ass up there too. I've been wanting to move back for years now, can't stand it down here lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just had to kill a baby dove yesterday, because a crow destroyed it's nest and knocked it out of the tree. Mom was nowhere to be found, so I sat with him for an hour, petting him and letting him look at it sky, probably wondering what the hell he did to get into this mess and why there was something 500x his size holding him. 

He had one feather, sticking straight out of his head. Poor dude. But he had no food to eat and no family, so he would have starved to death or been killed by fire ants, a crow or a cat. So I wrapped him up in a bag, and ended his life with a brick. Then I sat in the back yard and reflected on how nature doesn't give a fuck about anything.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The culture of the country's that these groups inhabit need to change. Right now, they are funded by opposing governments who want to fight over petty shit that is probably thousands of years old. Shiite vs. Sunni, Kurdish, vs. whoever, blah blah. They are more concerned with their tribal fights than ridding the regions of terrorism. And I think you're severely downplaying the effect that these "30k" members have had on the areas where they operate.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/25/world/map-isis-attacks-around-the-world.html?_r=0

<TEXT> No, we created the vacuum when we didn't make a 50 year plan to ensure a stable government was put into place. We shouldn't have gone to Iraq in the first place, since there are enough things to spend money on here (homelessness, aging infastructure, education, high speed rails, etc). But we did go, so we should have stayed. 

If people want to allow governments to remain in charge that chop their citizens hands off for stealing, execute gay people and adulterers, lock women up for driving, drop gas on minorities, that's something they'll have to live with I guess? Like I said before, the Western world is fucked either way. Either you do nothing and everyone flips out that nothing is being done to prevent these horrors (Sudan, Ethiopia, etc) or you drop a fuck ton of bombs and everyone flips out that you interfere in another country's affairs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If no one does anything about them? It absolutely will happen. Do you think they'd just be content to run around in the desert killing each other when they could make it to say.... Paris, Sweden, London by simply getting on an airplane or a boat unimpeded? The only thing that will slow them down is bombs and psychological warfare unfortunately. Once they are beaten down enough, the culture needs to be changed, which will take at least 2-3 generations. The US has bombed a lot of people that they had no business bombing, but this is not one of those situations. 

Also you have to acknowledge the catch 22 that the United States finds itself in every day. The most powerful military in the world either does nothing and gets chastised for a lack of action, or we do take action and everyone labels the United States as warmongers. So, fucked either way. </TEXT>
