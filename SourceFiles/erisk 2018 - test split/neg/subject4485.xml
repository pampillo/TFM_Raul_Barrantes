<TEXT> the problem is the "10/10" rating is that most people consider games that get a 5, utter pieces of shit

even though a game rated 5 should be an OK game, and everything below a 5/10 should be considered sorta bad games.

So based on this, i consider a "10/10" game some of the best ever. And there are only a couple of games like that. And none of them are from Valve. </TEXT>

Sure, they aren't BAD games, at all. of course not. but the 2 best games ever made?

they are way too short and way too easy. I only completed them coz they were short. but i got bored half way through both. i hoped the 2nd game had more interesting stuff added, but apart from some more dialog and such, it really didn't add much.. I think the humor was the main thing that had me complete the games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is very true

but games will (hopefully) start to utilize more cores in the future. Prey which released only a few days ago, runs at higher fps on Ryzen...

Both consoles run on AMD-made 8 core processors... i'd say 6-8 cores is the future - for gaming.

Of course if you dont plan on buying any newer games, an intel i5 or i7 would be (a slightly) better purchase. Though as soon as you stream or record your gameplay or something... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I ran into a guy who tried to sell me a security service such as this. and i live in an apartment building with a buzzer to enter the door. 

i felt that most thieves would probably go 100 meters across the street and steal from the large houses with easy-to-enter windows/doors

I do have an insurance though, which is all i'd really need. i dont really have much of sentimental value, and that is rarely what a thief would steal anyway. Usually i assume laptops and jewelery/money.... smaller things of high "street value"

but thanks for this post. It confirms my theory :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comedy movies that want a "serious" ending to the story (like the movie click. it had so much potential in the beginning, but it just screws itself over and ends up being this drama about a sad guy who didn't live his life..)

<TEXT> Bears eat a lot of blueberries before they hibernate. this stores fat. (from one of david attenboroughs films)

Fat is then used as fuel while its not eating anything.

That you lose muscle while fasting is a myth you gotta forget all about. it's simply not true.

The same principle is true in humans. 

There is a process called gluconeogenesis but it only lasts for a couple of days, and we're only talking a few grams. after that, the body starts breaking down fat for energy, and fuels your brain with ketones instead (which are made from fat)

Jason fung explains it here, pretty well - in under 2 minutes:

how well does it actually work?

Coz the roads are have today are pretty sturdy.

Also, plastic is kinda shit in comparison?

regular plastic breaks very easily when scratched.. how is it gonna handle a 20 ton truck at 55 mph?

and its not like roads are bad in terms of environmental damage.. its just some rocks are that tar like substance you mix.

but there's a reason many chefs keep learning after 40 years..

It's "Easy to learn, difficult to master"

Still, learning how to cook is great. how each individual ingredient can taste differently depending how its prepared/cooked and which other ingridients its mixed with, is an entirely different thing.

<TEXT> Data fra google maps, nu her ved 9:45 tiden, hvor der er en del mindre trafik end der er i "myldretrafikken":

Fra hvor jeg bor og over til min far:

Bil: 12 minutter

Bus: 45 minutter (+33 minutter)

Til min kreste:

Bil: 41 minutter

Bus: 1 time og 45 minutter (+64 minutter)

Til mit arbejde:

Bil: 12 minutter

Bus: 26 minutter (+14 minutter)

Og alt det er bare i den ene retning, s skal man jo ofte ogs den anden vej igen.

Alts, der er busbaner hist og her i rhus hvor jeg bor, men... det er jo ligegyldigt i langt de fleste tilflde, ifht at komme frem hurtigt.

Det er da umuligt en overraskelse at, folk foretrkker bilen fremfor en bus. Der er s mange fordele ved bilen, foruden du sparer en DEL tid hver dag ifht din daglige tur p arbejde og hjem igen. Dertil kommer der alt det andet praktiske bilen s ogs kan bruges til, nr du IKKE krer til og fra arbejde. Her i blandt, indkb, ture til familie eller p smferier osv. 

Har du nogensinde taget til ikea med en bus og handlet nogen mbler? nej. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a friend who asked me to build him a PC

i asked him about his budget and what he wanted to play... He said he's like to start playing something other than LoL but his current laptop could barely handle it. I showed him a few games on my pc.

He then said, he might as well get a higher end gamer, so he could really get into it. so i build him one, with his consent, i explained why he could spend less, showed him alternatives and such.

anyways. he ended up spending 3500 dollars (incl a monitor though) as i said he should settle with a 970 GTX, because the 10xx series was coming soon (this was before summer last year)

to this day, he has still only ever played league of legends on his PC... that's fine of course... just seems extremely stupid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im a bit late to this thread but here goes:

Better research system. I heard that was some changes coming in 1.2 but i havnt seen that. 

a much better management system for employees. have them ask for a raise instead of complaining about pay and eventually quit. there were wage negotiations in theme park 20 years ago... im not asking for a minigame, but it just feels weird to quit before asking for more money?

Maybe have a system where employees have work schedules, call in sick or whatever, so you might need to spend more money on wages, because you'd need a few excess staff, for when times are busy. 

maybe have the day/night system matter, in terms of how busy the park is. during the early hours and mid-day, maybe there are more families with children. and during the afternoon and evening, we see the older crowd staying around. 

Have some types of food/drink shops be more interesting to different types of people - depending on the time of day. Donuts in the morning and tacos in the evening, or something. this means you might wanna have multiple stores of multiple types all over the park, depending on the time of day, the employee management system could close down donut shops at 18:00 and open the more dinner-related stores or go home (to save a few bucks - this might be important to adjust on harder difficulties)

I'm just basically kinda bored with only building my park. i find that the "game" is lacking a lot, and i've not played the game since january </TEXT>

<TEXT> Check to see if the windows (And outter doors) are closing properly. air might be coming right in through shitty windows. thats expensive (in heat/aircon)

come by at night to see if there's much noise (nearby disco for example or very party-like neighbours)

check your cell reception (and a friend/partners reception, if they have a different carrier)

Check if you can have proper internet speeds

ideally check if theres mold (bulging wallpaper, weird smells etc). I just drilled some holes to wallmount something, and i drilled straight into a brick wall, and it was very mushy, on the left side (e.g. dust didn't fly out, but rather the drill was just sticky). That wall is shared with the bathroom... thats a bad sign i think. luckily im planning on moving soon, and its a rented apartment, and im not responsible for any walls internal damage

something handy to notice too is.. check if there's wall outlets in all rooms (preferably multiple). there isn't were i live. its very annoying...

and ask if you're allowed to drill into all walls etc. having limitations can be frustrating. It's rare though as far as i know. but i've heard of some people having to pay X per hole drilled into dry wall, even though they rented the house for a fortune for 6 years.. this meant they didn't hang up many pictures. tv used a stand and they only had 1 ceiling mounted lamp.

I have disabled various things such as sync, bluelight filter, and such. it's still there.

http://imgur.com/a/I4Ysc - it's the circle with a + inside.

Any idea what it is, and how i can disable it?

It looks sorta like it could be 33% done with something? but it's been like this since it appeared shortly after i updated to nougat.

any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Thanks </TEXT>

i can imagine there are similar non-samsung apps and software that can do it  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I heard good things about gaming on ryzen as well.. the smoothness. fewer drops in framerate and such. I have a 6600K currently and i feel like i've somewhat wasted my money getting that chip. (I upgraded from a i5 2500K)

i do gaming and some (not a whole lot) of video editing. I have considered getting a 1700. Though because of money, i am considering just waiting a year or whatever, for "Zen 2" </TEXT>

because spending money on a new monitor, when it might be related to other hardware, could be silly.

and so i get to bed at around 22:00 and get up between 4 or 6 every day. So when i dont start work before 11, i still have 5 hours before work, where i can chill, shower, eat, cook an awesome lunch and do a few chores or whatever i need to do, before work. 

Usually though, i just play computer games and browse reddit.

When all cores are done before work, all my spare time after work is... spare time. i dont have any obligrations except a few social stuff whenever it's been arranged. it's nice. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't mean to sound like an asshole here

but maybe a lot of woman are terrible at judging mens behavior (of course, not a all men "show" some murdery side of themselves) 

but a lot of woman stay with violent men, because they "love" them.. i at least hear this quite often. a woman was  beaten up and threatened quite a lot by her husband for years, before she was able to see that she needed to leave.

So out of those 11766 victims, how many were in abusive relationships before the actual murder?

I'm NOT saying it's the victims fault in those cases, im just saying there might have been signs for them to leave and get help, before it's too late. And that info could be used today, to save more woman from a potential murderer. </TEXT>

Sure the concept is nice and its an interesting setting but it really doesnt offer much when you look past that.

the puzzles are easy and there's not too much variety and its very short. and theres absolutely no replay value.

I'd love some "Actual" game set within the portal universe with a portal gun, and we might see it.. who know. but portal in its current state seems more like ... proof of concept or something, rather than an actually super awesome game that most people seem to consider it. 

also, try to elaborate. you dont think portal 1 and 2 are easy puzzle games without replay value? </TEXT>

install "DSFix" and use a controller. (Dsfix gives 60 fps cap instead of 30 and you can also adjust the resolution of textures and such)

Get dsfix here

http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix

im not gonna spoil the game for you at all. stun1ock said it best. Dont level up resitance and kill the dogs first.

also good luck and dont rush yourself. and preferably do NOT look up spoilers, please. don't do it. you'll ruin your own experience with the game.
