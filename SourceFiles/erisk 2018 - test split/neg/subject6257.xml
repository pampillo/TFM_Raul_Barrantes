<TITLE> Book depository question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 19:52:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been searching for an answer on my question on the forums, i've went on the contact us page and wrote the question there to Book Depository (a few hours ago, waiting 24 hours is too long lol)

But putting that aside, here's my question:

I've been buying manga, books, etc on book depository but i've never asked this question, does book depository sell brand new manga/books right from the print factory/publisher (the place where the manga/books get printed/published). (However you wanna call it)

Or do they sell used manga/books that are still new? </TEXT>

<TEXT> How? Can you please link me? 

Or can you open a forum or something with a poll of votes that want a english licence? You know if this subreddit got a group together to advertise (lol) the manga so it gets populair so english publishers could notice the amount of people who talk about it on the internet. Maybe then a cheeky licence? (I'm desperate for the manga @_@) </TEXT>

It it because my iphone 6s sound card is broken or my earplugs? (Is the earplug's jack broken?) or is my iphone 6s headphone jack broken OR the soundcard thingy? </TEXT>

Also still, the mang art used for an animation would be amazing doe. Holy hell it would get so much attention so quickly.

Also i don't think the scanlators would drop this series and on batato the scanlator's get paid right? (With ads, batato gives the money they earn from ads to the scanlators, i read that somewhere on reddit) </TEXT>

<TEXT> 7 years? LOL that's so unfair.

Also i've read somewhere that bell has the power (is it because of the realis phrase off  does he have other secret power?) he can make his own skills by will. I mean like he wanted to be a hero so he got the argonaut skill? So is his power to develop skills by will (things he wants to achieve?) and also can he create infinite amount of skills? )i read somewhere he is a person that's born once a thousand years)

But still that is OP af creating the skills by willpower op shit </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been buying manga from book depository for a long time now. I wanna buy the Dragon ball/DBZ Vizbig editions, but the price is the same on Bol.com (for the dutch manga collectors, here's a question): are the manga from bol.com new or do they use old ones? (I mean like i've heard they use old books from people who returned their broken down old manga and sell them as new) so should i use bol.com for my Vizbig editions or book depository?

Btw: (i wanna use bol.com ONLY for my vizbig/omni bus and box set's because they have the same price and i won't have to wait for the shipping from book depository lol, the normal manga from book depository are like 5-8 euro's while bol.com is like 10-12 euro's, but the omnibus/vizbig and box set's stay the same price. book depository is cheaper (and brand new quality) for buying single volume manga's) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it a physical or digital release? (I would prefer physical).

Also, anime studios never adapt from manga adaptations of light novels. That's just not how it works. Otherwise, the manga is pretty generically rushed honestly when compared.

i know but still, the way the manga is set (the art and stuff, would be amazing as an anime adaption, I really love the art style damn).

<TEXT> I hope this manga gets a english release, also the LN aswell. This series has alot of potential. An anime adaption of the manga would be awesome (i mean like the manga is already drawn so taking the art style and images and animate them, yes i know anime adaptions always happen from the LN but the manga could be a bit different, haven't read the LN yet and the manga could be better to adapt from, because studios always cut alot of material out (they leave alot of material out with other series).

Basically Manga adaption  LN adaption for an anime adaption. </TEXT>

Puttin that aside, does the Manga exactly adapt the LN, i mean the Text and stuff? Have you read the LN's? How close is the manga to the anime and LN? I haven't read the LN yet, i planning to buy 1-5 of the LN (the volumes the anime has adapted, i wanna check how much the anime has left out) and after that i'm buying 6-8 (i use bookdepository) </TEXT>

IF the author just decided to focus more on the manga, he could get anime material out of the manga too.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could it be that bell and aiz are brother and sister? In one of the episodes and manga bell said "Mother" when he was lying down when waking up on aiz's lap (his mother could look like aiz) but this isn't the only proof it, aiz's dad had white hair (hint?) and her mom had the same color as her's. If that's the case, if bell thought aiz was his mother when waking up that means aiz looks like his mother right? 
(Is it maybe hinted in the LN?) (anyone who reads the LN please tell meh).

It would be OP doe. Good luck deflecting a sonic boom fist and outrunning/deflecting a person who moves at the speed of sound lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read alot of manga's and hands down tsugumomo is my fav right now. AW yis

Question 1: Please TELL ME (PLEASE) is kiriha going go be revived? (I SHIP EM HARD).
Question 2: Will tsugumomo get a english release? i'm certain they'll get alot of sales, i mean alot (the community is quite large).
Question 3: also, (this was in the manga) it's said that tsugumomo and humans can have children? So if kiriha returns and IF there's gonna be a happy ending at the end could they have kids? (It's possible between tsugumomo and humans, right?)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ARE saeko and Rei sisters?(half sisters?) On chapter 12 en episode 11 saeko said a line that they could maybe be sisters, she said something like "in reality we are" then rei said "i don't want to hear it" or something like that, people are saying it was about that they are/should've been in the same ear but they had been hold a year by that problem. BUT STILL in wiki (saeko's wiki page) it says rei and saeko could have a professional or familial relationship.

<TEXT> But i think the knife's status is bell's status, they said "while bell is growing the knife does too" i think the knife is connected to bell energy force/power level. That's such a awesome weapon, i would REALLY REALLY want the knife to become a sword ONLY when bell touches it, like when the knife's writing lights up (only if bell touches it) then it becomes a sword, when he puts it away or lets go of the knife the power goes away and it becomes a knife (like what everyone is saying, only the hestia family/bell can use the knife, if someone else does it becomes useless, that same effect but then with transforming from a knife to a sword would be epic).  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-03-13 20:56:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Is season 2 coming out soon? Or do they still need to announce it?

Other stuff:
1: Does bell get to know that he has that fast growth skill later on? 
2: When you get to a certain level can you become a god/godess (like if bell reached the ultimate level(highest level possible?) - bell possibly becoming a god??
3: The knife gets stronger while bell also does right? Wouldn't it be epic if the knife becomes a sword after a certain power/level, like if someone else touches it the power goes away and it becomes a knife again. Like only bell can make it a sword again, they said in the anime if anyone else other than bell uses the knife it becomes a useless knife right? That's how i came up with the sword theory huehue ^_^
4: (question for light novel readers) is it further explained how the knife exactly works with bell? Like a better explanation than the anime? (I mean exactly how it works, maybe after the anime in a new volume they explained how it works, additionall information about the knife (Hestia knife)
5: does bell get stronger than everyone later on in the LN
Last question 6: which volume does the anime end at in the Light Novel?  </TEXT>

I support yami the most thb. She has been through so much, she needs to feel love. I want every girl to be happy, so many girls are depending on rito, he possibly can't choose one and break all the hearts of the other girls, it's SUPPOSED to end a harem. It must, otherwise the story will never be TRULY complete, so much character development would be all waste...TEAM MOTHAFUKINGGGG HAREM xd

(I've been reading this story for such a long time now, i'm really hoping that the author ends it the way everyone wants to it to end, HAREM.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's just hope it ends as a harem, so much character development would be a waste if he chooses haruna, still don't get 1 thing in this entire story, Rito fell in love only because haruna defended him because she told people that he didn't break the flowers...is that it? Is that supposed the be the best fall-in-love story? Run, momo, yami, lala and the others went trough so much character development and then fell in love but still rito loves haruna the most? Only because of that BS reason?? Really? I think the author made a big mistake with haruna as a whole, i mean she shouldn't ever been created in the story tbh lol </TEXT>

Has the storywriter confirmed somewhere that it's going to end a harem? After so much that has happened and if it doesn't end a harem i think the whole story would turn out to be a failure, so much character development of the girls like yami, momo, lala and the others..rito can't choose 1 girl, he would break everyone's heart...we need confirmation that it is going to end a harem, right???? </TEXT>

So basically: 
A1 licence: 11kw/125cc (17/18-19 age)
A2 licence: 35kw (20-23 age)
A licence: whatever power you want. (22-24 age) </TEXT>

<TEXT> IF zamasu killed gowasu, then the god of destruction from universe 10 died. If The kaioshin of universe 7 died, then beerus died too. But what happens to whis and the other universe 10 god? Im sure whis wouldn't allow black to be a god of destruction if that happened

Any theory's?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think i heard that the movie isn't cannon anymore..atleast i saw it in alot of yt comments being discussed about..and whis himself said it in this video that the gods power is the top of the castle and goku and vegeta's is that top of the tree..so if you scale it in a percentage i would say beerus used maybe 10%? lol. DBS is 100% cannon so  yeah... </TEXT>

<TEXT> So basically, when switching to first gear you let the clutch slowly and and at switching to 2, 3, 4 and etc you let it fast? Or still slowly? (Bit confused lol) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just wanted to ask you guys this, imagine if you're on 2nd or 3rd or even a higher gear and then you release the clutch to fast will the motorcycle shut down? Or does that only happen when you switch to 1st gear and release the clutch to fast?

(I hope this isn't a stupid question :( lol) </TEXT>
