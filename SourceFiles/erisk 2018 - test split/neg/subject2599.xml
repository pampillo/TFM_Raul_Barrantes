<TEXT> I agree about the limited number of literate people not having enough critical mass to birth a god. And second-order audiences, such as a congregation listening to a priest reading a Bible, wouldn't count either. So that would leave monks and a tiny sliver of aristocrat families. China's larger populations may have let this happen earlier, but of course we're talking about Media, not . ;)

Tangent: even if a larger absolute number of worshippers might justify a deification event, wouldn't it also require a certain percentage as well? Otherwise, a proto-Media would be drowned out by other fledgling gods elbowing their way into that culture. I mean, *something's* got to exist to keep all the riffraff out! *Harumph!* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. I allude to that  smaller sacrifices per worshipper but vastly more worshippers to make up for it. Thus, Media requires *Mass* Media to incorporate. 

The earlier media revolutions either lacked the degree or the scale. Gutenberg Bibles didn't result in blood sacrifice, unless you count things like The Inquisition but even then, arguably the gods involved would have to share in the mana. Thus, no *oomph*. While attention and time were sacrificed, but the audience of literate people of the era was far too small to matter. </TEXT>

<TITLE> When did Media anthropomorphize into a sentient god? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 20:22:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, it's **New** Gods, yet media has been around since Babylonian times, even earlier if you count oral history.

I interpret Media as being the stuff that's communicated, with Technical Boy being the means of communication (and other things tech), so let's assume that is how our new gods divide their labor. That is, your iPhone is a Tech Boy altar, your listening to Beyonc a sacrifice (but *so* worth it!) to Media.

Mr Wednesday cited the telegraph as the beginning of the Information Age (he's not happy  at all!), so did Media incorporate the first time there was electronic communication: the dots   dashes?

Or was it later, with Victorolas and Edison's wax cylinders? Or later, with the motion pictures of the silent era  the Clair Bows and Rudolph Valentinos?

I think Media came into being slightly before this, when there were mass audiences capable of being enough in the aggregate to support a deity. The earlier periods (Mediaeval manuscripts, say, or even a Gutenberg Bible) had media. But they didn't reach a critical mass to make up for the fact that smaller sacrifices were made per worshiper. It didn't scale, to use a tech concept common today.

There had to be enough critical mass birth my favorite New Goddess, Media. But when?

So I boldly place Media's birthday around [the rise of the Victrola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Talking_Machine_Company), or around 1900. [Edison's Phonograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Talking_Machine_Company) happened around the same time. [Auguste and Louis Lumire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumire) were also debuting their [Cinematograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematograph), which gave birth to Nickelodeons around 1895, so this era seems apt.

What say you? Why? </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, most travelers aren't searched. So, odds are tremendously good if you're not interesting, they won't even ask about your digital devices.

And like the Sith, there are always two border control checkpoints per transit. Never fewer, never more. Don't focus just on one since the other may be just as pushy.

What's your nationality and what's your threat profile? Who are you worried might target you (US or the Philippines) and are you in a higher-risk category (sadly, this includes journalists or anyone joining with a group to help others)?

Are you only worried about a phone, or a laptop too? Flash drives?

Do not lie to US Customs agents. That's a felony and you'll have all kinds of fun even if they don't prosecute and "only" put you on the heightened security watch list. You'll never get off, or at best, you'll be on the list for years.

Make it so you when you cross the border, you can truthfully say, "I got nothing." Or, "I got something generic and useless, wanna see?"

If you're a US citizen and US Customs asks you to hand them your unlocked phone, plan ahead. If you plan on saying No, it's your right. It's also within their power to say, Great, we'll hang on to your phone! Think about what happens if they threaten to hang on to your devices if they're unsatisfied. Can you live without them for a week or a month?

Social media accounts are *supposedly* safer from being searched, especially if you're a US citizen (assuming US Customs is part of your concern), but this may vary. Likewise passwords. Especially delete any Social Apps on your phone. That way if you say you don't have an account, you won't have counter-evidence on your phone.

Three techniques I recall offhand:

* Broadly, having a minimal travel phone   laptop is best, but expensive.

* Having wiped devices with no traces of Apps you use on them, then installing them then accessing your Cloud when safe is another option. Then doing the same as you re-enter. But then you've got to worry whether your threat profile includes foes being able to get warrants, etc. from these providers.

* Wiping then saving to a Flash drive can work, but only if the contents are encrypted and "your boss" (etc) has the encryption key that you've (securely) emailed them.

<TEXT> Well, absent your city having their refuse company deal with it, then your city should be dealing with it. And if they're not, then that's something residents need to take up w/ their city council, or get (or fund) a group to do it.

To be fair, this isn't a cheap, easy solution w/o trash contractors having a role. That's probably why Oakland's made it part of the contract. It's a bit more up front, but much less than having a fleet of city trucks roaming around looking for trash.

Short answer: call your local pols and if things are messed up, let them know. Don't (only) vent here. :)

Maybe your city has a site mention or a phone number to report trash/junk? Each city is different, so I can't help you on specifics. Sorry! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, damn. My bad  I thought I was in /r/Oakland.

Uhh, okay. Modest revision. Check with your local refuse company. And if they don't have special carting days, talk to your city council  ours didn't originally until our city council folks made sure it was part of the contract.

I'd also like to see local area dumping areas so folks don't have to drive to the main dump, of assorted kinds. 

Concord seems an anomaly, though. Oakland has various options. San Leandro has at least electronic waste days where you can carry your toxic (but so shiny!) junk to various places and they'll dispose of it for you safely. I see signs for these all the time.

I recall for Da Town, some items like a mattress you can call ahead, and you get a couple of these per year. Other mixed-bag (bundle) are anything goes, so long as they fit within dimensions  I recall 3x4 feet bundles not weighing more than I forget pounds. Lined in a row, and 3 or 4 bundles per trip. No construction materials. Electronic waste for other days.

There are places like Goodwill that might take them if they're in good shape.

But yeah, for some things, you'll need to take things to the dump. A refrigerator or a sofa, I'd think. Which is fair.

So from what you're saying, it changes from city to city, and Concord needs a lot more work. I'd push for that, or even, organize online (via Reddit?) to get 20 folks to sign a petition or show up at a council meeting. If you don't squawk, they won't hear. I know we have a rep in Oakland for being uhh active, but we're also active in ways like this. You can be, too. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> In its draft technical capability notices paper [PDF], all communications companies  including phone networks and ISPs  will be obliged to provide real-time access to the full content of any named individual within one working day, as well as any "secondary data" relating to that person.

That includes encrypted content  which means that UK organizations will not be allowed to introduce true end-to-end encryption of their users' data but will be legally required to introduce a backdoor to their systems so the authorities can read any and all communications.

So it's limited to telecom companies and ISPs. Not third parties like software developers or OS developers? That seems a glaring (and welcome) gaping hole. Or am I reading it wrong?

Obviously, for people using real encryption not offered by their ISP: good luck with that!

But just that they're trying to, and the scope of their surveilling innocents is alarming and worth pointing to. </TEXT>

Besides, it goes without saying that Google only wants your photos so they can do advanced algorithmic identifying/categorizing things with them, linked to your Google account, which is probably linked to your phone number?

<TEXT> Republicans spend their own money on themselves when they can get us common folk to pay for it for them? What are you, some kind of Nazi Communist ISIS-worshiping terrorist?

Why, simply figuring out how to spend the $800 billion the AHCA tax breaks that they expect is a crushing burden on these poor Conservative politicians. Now you want them to spend their *own* money on their *own* health?

<TEXT> There was over $3m raised in the first day  grassroots, small donor, the kinds that show there's vote-casting momentum  after the Rep AHCA vote, [more than $1m to a Daily Kos fund for whoever wins the Dem nomination in races where a Republican Congressman won in a Blue district.](http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/5/6/1659591/-Trumpcare-vote-spurs-Daily-Kos-donors-to-raise-more-than-1-25-million-for-24-House-races-in-2018)

$3 million for a hypothetical opponent, without anyone to rally behind. It's *unheard* of.

This of course, makes it more likely further funding will follow this seed money, as well as make it more likely a fence-sitting but viable person will declare they're in to crush the Red incumbent.

It's going to hurt them. Hurt them bad. And that's not even taking into account the Senate, where gerrymandering stunts can't tilt the odds to favor the incumbent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, when most think about digital personal assistants, they think of something that can handle queries like this, with certainly a text UI but usually with a voice-driven one:

* What's the weather going to be for next week?

* What movies are playing around here?

* Play Station to Station (Bowie song)

* Who is the King of Scotland (movie, Wikipedia for Scottish royalty It should ask)?

* Get me tickets for the Yankees game.

* Call Marsha (which Marsha since everyone has 5 Marshas and every Marsha has 3 voice lines)

* What are the Yelp reviews for Mi Tacos Carbon? (third-party App   data sets, location services, it knowing you're asking about food, not a book or film). Bonus for follow-up telling you how to get (walk, transit, drive?) there.

* Read my texts.

* Read my Messages (that is, a specific App)

* Text Marsha that I'll be running 15 minutes late (several of above challenges rolled into one. Yay!)

Bonus points for "Who's on first?" riffing off Abbott   Costello routine or other culturally significant and/or funny implementations.

The number of different datasets  some internal, some external, some 3rd party  are dizzying. And it has to respond in under 5 secs w/ a 98% accuracy rate else folks won't use it.

Oh yeah. Plus it has to account for fact that everyone speaks differently (if voice-driven), has different slang and has different background noise. Even if text-based, it has to account for all these differences, plus typos.

It. Is. **Hard.**

And again, it has to work quickly and accurately before it's released to public or folks will try it once, snicker, then delete it. So all those (significant) costs have to be paid for long before there's any hope of a dime of revenue (however that will happen, which is also very hard). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's reasonable to look at the challenges of having a digital personal assistant that's worth using, while respecting privacy. I don't see a FLOSS solution to this since it requires a ton of data, quickly accessible yet secure  /or anonymized, as well as a Cloud infrastructure (same challenges) and server farms (ditto) to pull it off. What's the revenue model  one is required since these items are *very* expensive and the costs front-loaded before general release.

There are great FLOSS solutions for tasks out there, but Personal Assistants probably aren't one of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By definition, Google   Microsoft assistants work against user's privacy. Apple [has a section on how it protects privacy for customers using Siri](https://www.apple.com/privacy/approach-to-privacy/). 

The longer you use Siri and Dictation, the better they understand you and the better they work. To help them recognize your pronunciation and provide better responses, certain information such as your name, contacts, and songs in your music library is sent to Apple servers using encrypted protocols. That said, **Siri and Dictation do not associate this information with your Apple ID, but rather with your device through a random identifier**. Apple Watch uses the Siri identifier from your iPhone. You can reset that identifier at any time by turning Siri and Dictation off and back on, effectively restarting your relationship with Siri and Dictation. When you turn Siri and Dictation off, Apple will delete the User Data associated with your Siri identifier, and the learning process will start all over again 

You can also receive helpful suggestions before you even ask, based on the things you use often and when you typically use them. **These predictions are kept on your device, not in the cloud, so the information is protected by all the safeguards that are built in.** Which means private information like your email, contacts, app usage, and calendar can stay private. Suggested events from Mail do not leave your device until they are confirmed by you, and only then are they added to your calendar 

So basically, since their revenue model doesn't rely on selling *you* to others, Apple uses a combination of tokens, keeping PII on your device (which is encrypted, right?) or only allowing access only after users have explicitly granted it. Versus Google, Facebook or Microsoft, who use their Personal Assistant promises as a honeypot to entice you into revealing more personal information about yourself so they can then distribute and sell it to others.

I'd guess FLOSS alternatives won't have personal assistants worth much of anything since it requires a *lot* of data then very clever algorithms parsing everything to an AI to give personal suggestions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Corbyn may have won the partys leadership handsomely twice over, but insiders say that the leader of the oppositions office  or Loto, as it is known in party parlance  has never really lost a sense of siege. They would add that there is some justification for that. Matt Zarb-Cousin, who recently stepped down as Corbyns spokesman, [told the US magazine Jacobin this week](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/04/jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may-media-general-election-labour/)  just as the election campaign cranks into gear  that Labour party staff habitually handed sensitive information to the press to destabilise the leadership.

There were endless leaks from Southside, which makes it incredibly difficult to function in a professional way, he said. I dont think anyone would be able to under those conditions.

<TEXT> Teaching kids is really simple, if you aren't motivated to screw them and their parents over.

* Smaller class sizes, somewhere around 30.

* Prep in the form of Head Start before the kids embark on their educational career.


* Ensuring kids needs are taken care of so they're not hungry, distracted or abused (thus lunches for all, less sugar available and counseling/social services)

* Job stability at a single location by qualified professionals who've devoted many years of their lives in both the subject matter and in pedagogy, at good wages and benefits. And, yup, unions, because while there are a few really crappy teachers protected by unions, there are also some really crappy administrators overseeing all teachers. Our teachers  and your kids  need to be protected from them.

* Up-To-Date books and all the school supplies students need.

* Some way of communicating with parents to teach them how to create better studying environments in their homes (yeah, this one is tougher)

* Reliable spending so students   teachers aren't wondering if their classes will exist the next year.

This requires money. Money that for ideological or self-interested reasons, some Pols don't want to see passed through. This also requires states (or even the Federal government) don't use local taxes to fund schools, since this results in richer districts lavishing their kids with resources while poorer districts starve.

But the single biggest thing is parents. If you have parents who know how to motivate their kids to do well in school, they'll do well in school. That's the big con for Charter schools and private schools: their Killer App is that they're able to cull these "easier" students who'd do well regardless, leaving the public system with all the educationally more challenging ones. It's not that they're better at pedagogy, it's that they take the best performers, move them to their own racetrack, then yell at the other racetrack administrators, "Do more with less!"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every so often, we like hyping other Subs. This one is /r/POTUSWatch, which aims to have less hyperbolic coverage of the current President.

Check it out!

/r/POTUSWatch aims to observe and host civil discourse regarding the actions and statements of the President of the United States (POTUS) and the other machinations of the Federal Executive Branch. To call Donald J. Trump, the current President, a controversial figure is putting it mildly, and it can prove easy to find oneself lost in the constant stream of scandal-claims and allegations. This is why it's more important than ever to facilitate civil and critical discussion centered around facts and observations, as opposed to rumor and newsroom hyperbole.

In terms of content, one of the great concerns at the heart of the sub is the idea that a community should not be an echo chamber. This community thrives on diverse opinions and source material from both sides of the fence. One can expect myriad [articles and reports](http://www.dw.com/en/us-to-tighten-sanctions-on-north-korea/a-38604778?maca=en-rss-en-top-1022-rdf), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqy4nqqFe_0 feature=youtu.be), the ever-crucial [fact-checks](http://www.snopes.com/trump-considering-resignation/), [provocative questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/POTUSWatch/comments/61tnol/question_about_trumps_vacation_time/?st=j1zr6mgw sh=809105a1) from the community and, of course, a neverending supply of [Tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/848857910297980928) from the man himself.

As one could expect from a subreddit that prides itself on neutrality and evidence-based discussion, the community aims to be neutral and level-headed in their interactions. While this isn't always feasible, especially considering the divisive nature of the times, the sub is actively and fairly moderated. Free speech is present, of course, for better or for worse, but there is no denying that the existing community and its moderation team are moving forward with a firm grasp on the intended character of the forum; that is, to be unbiased, critical, and observant in all things Presidential. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf released her proposed 2017-2019 budget late last Friday. She's projecting a $32.5 million gap over the two years that will have to be bridged with spending cuts and new revenue.

To those saying, "We need to spend more on police!!", note the largest single budget item?

Police: 20.98%

That's twice the next-largest item. *Twice* what we spend for our fire department. *Twice* our public works (roads   such). *Ten times* what we spend on libraries (America's engine for equality and self-improvement) and Parks   Recreation (America's engine for Sunday Drum Circles and places for teenagers to make out). *Hundreds* over things like our commissions, auditors and clerks.

And I'll bet these don't include pensions, lawsuits (defending cases *and* settlements) and other charges.

Plus they're adding:

50 more cops: $1.5 million would pay for a third police academy in 2018-2019, adding fifty more officers to the department. This would bring the total number of sworn officers to 792 from the current 754. Schaaf's budget does **not** include the cost of these new officers' salaries in future years. That will cost millions extra. 

This comes on top of $9.4 million approved last year, outside of the budget process, for the hiring of more police officers. 

Another $9.3 million was similarly allocated for the hiring of more police officers in 2015, outside of the normal budget process. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Related, Jordan Pearson's Motherboard article: [Facebook Has to Keep Apologizing for Its Business Model](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/facebook-has-to-keep-apologizing-for-its-business-model)

Worth the read, but some snips:

The difference between building a tool to serve ads to young people when they're feeling crappy and telling companies to craft ads that target young people who are feeling crappy seems minor.

Regardless, the whole thing fits a familiar pattern for Facebook: [some new horror from the bowels of the company emerges,](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/facebook-is-making-us-all-live-inside-emotional-filter-bubbles) and [Facebook apologizes like it somehow doesn't reflect the company's entire business strategy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users). That is, leveraging detailed insights about people's lives and state of mind (to the extent that can be divined by their Facebook activities)), for a profit motive.

Also note *cough* Facebook is a multi-billion-dollar social media company and it'd be incredible if they didn't have PR efforts involving scores of people to push their narrative on Facebook and other social media, including Reddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, I've reinstated it. Sorry about being to twitchy but we get a lot of spam, some of it pretty clever. I've also updated my pinned comment.

The thing about web-based mail is most of it is "free" in exchange for extensive metadata analysis. This is an intrinsic problem if you're interested in privacy and a threat if your friend lives under a hostile government. There's also a transparency issue: we know what SMTP is, how it works, its processes. No gotchas, versus whatever web-based email providers do is opaque.

Personally, I don't think PGP is that hard, but I'm not a novice. ProtonMail is popular, as is Signal if you're fine chatting vs writing.

Check out EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense, on the right sidebar. It's amazing. Have your friend check it out too. You both also want to insure your devices are secure (consider doing a clean wipe then reinstall, after backing your files up). Change all your passwords to new, stronger, different ones (cue a suggestion to use a password manager). This includes **all** your web passwords, every single one. Plus 2-Factor Authentication. Yeah, what a pain. You're in a different league than before, it looks like (or at least, s/he is).

At some point, given your threat profiles, you'll want to evaluate Tor.

Cheers and again, sorry for pausing your post. :) </TEXT>

Plus, the irony of /r/Privacy insisting on basically doxxing people would cause a rip in the timespace continuum. ;)

But we do verify protocols and procedures (especially to the extent that they're FLOSS so you, our esteemed readers, can verify) since like all good things privacy related, don't trust the person, trust the protocols, tech and procedures.

<TEXT> The European Union has called on Theresa May to provide immediate serious and real guarantees to its citizens living in Britain. The EU leaders took just four minutes at a special summit to agree unanimously an uncompromising opening stance in the Brexit negotiations.

Leaders said they would not discuss a future trade deal with the British government until sufficient progress is made on the issues of Britains estimated 60bn divorce bill, the rights of EU nationals in the UK, and the border in Ireland.

The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told reporters at the special summit in Brussels that EU citizens in Britain were the number one priority, and that he had discussed the need for Britain to now live up to its warm words regarding EU citizens during a dinner with the prime minister in Downing Street last week 

Having May   the Tories live up to what they promised seems a reasonable request.

<TEXT> There's some background info needed. In order to not have a nearly impossible 2/3s requirement (for taxes not going to the general fund), Oakland wrote its referendum so that Soda Tax funds go into the general fund. Like [Berkeley's Soda Tax](http://www.berkeleyvsbigsoda.com) which was our model. Thus the funds are reserved for uses the referendum stated. Their [FAQ](http://www.berkeleyvsbigsoda.com/faq#q5) gives more info, check it out:

**Where does the money go? How does the Panel of Experts work?**

The tax revenue goes into the citys general fund. Accountability is written into the measure: Measure D creates a panel of experts in child nutrition, healthcare, and education to make recommendations to the City Council about funding programs that improve childrens health across Berkeley. The panel will issue annual public reports detailing the impact of funded programs.

This is a system that has proven to work in Berkeley. The City and citizens of Berkeley have a decades-long, ongoing commitment to child health and nutrition. City Council has a proven track record of respecting the recommendations of their boards and commissions. For example, the Children, Youth, and Recreation Commission makes recommendations to Council about general fund appropriations in the same way as the Panel written into Measure D would, and the City Council has consistently adopted that Commissions full recommendations.

After Measure D was passed, the panel of experts was formed. As of January 2017, over $2.5 million has been raised by the tax, to go to community health and nutrition efforts, including school garden programs. 

We can do it, Oakland. Big Soda is *praying* pols like Schaaf make a cash-grab against the spirit and letter of the law we passed. That way, Oakland can be their poster child for why no other city should ever pass *any* laws protecting their kids (and big kids) in situations like this.

Don't let Oakland be their corporate stooge. Call/email your councilmembers today and tell them to fight Schaaf's Soda Tax cash-grab. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Sigh*. It totally is a story.

The summaries and supporting sites also say that while funds will be shunted to the general fund, that a board will be created of health   kid-related folks to administer Soda Tax funds to the promised purpose.

Berkeley did it. So have other municipalities backing the Soda Tax. We can do better. And we are. Council members Brooks, Campbell-Washington   Kaplan have announced their opposition to Schaaf's cash grab against the initiative's intent, and they'll take action to prevent it.

This is **not** normal. If for no other reason, do you think other cities' Soda Taxes will pass if Oakland becomes the poster child for cash-grabs taken under false pretenses? Big Soda will go nuts over this. Think big picture: they're licking their lips over this, hoping we'll be their stooges.

So, don't downvote. Instead, contact your Oakland reps to make your voice heard! </TEXT>

[Berkeley, CA: Racist Attacks on Black Owned Cooperative Follow Alt-Right Trump Rally](https://itsgoingdown.org/racist-attacks-on-black-owned-cooperative-in-berkeley-after-alt-right-rally/). 

April 27th, 2017  The windows of Alchemy Collective Cafe were shot out the night after white supremacists and pro-Trump supporters rallied in Berkeley, California.

Alchemy is a largely Black and People of Color owned worker cooperative with Black Lives Matter and indigenous solidarity posters in the glass. Community members suspect the attack is race related because this is the second time windows were broken here after a pro-Trump rally in Berkeley, them having been broken a few nights after the March 4 Trump rally.

I am shocked and angry, but this is just the kind of tactic white supremacists have used for ages to induce fear in our communities, and its not going to work, one patron said. Neighbors are pouring in with support.

Click thru for more.

And so, yeah, when the Neo-Nazis #hashtag on and on and on about #FreeSpeech, **always** ask yourself, "Okay. Fine. But let's go one hop forward. So, what *ideas* are they about? What's their end-game? What's their concept of the ideal world they want us all to ~~live in~~ be trapped in?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> But of course, elasticity isn't kryptonite to supply/demand curves, but a modifier.

Highly elastic goods have a more direct effect while non-elastic ones less so, but forces still remain. Raise prices enough and even insulin customers won't buy it (because they can't afford it).

Of course, Republicans wouldn't see this as a problem since the (dead) customer had "access" to insulin up until his last, dying breath. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, let's get away from the "Free Speech!!" aspects that the Neo-Nazis go on and on about. Fine, they had their chance to yammer on amongst each other. Most from outside Berkeley, even the Bay Area, even some outside California. Ok, great. So they had their venue. And?

What precisely *is* the speech and ideas that, once they have (even more) platforms, they want exposure for? That women with agency suck? That non-heteronormal folks should cower in basements? That woman secretly want to be raped by so-called Alphas? That Jewish people make great lampshades? That corporations are people and as such they should rule societies like back in the 1920s? That the SS had great uniforms but what they really needed was a frog mascot? What?

*That's* what we should be focusing on. Once the song   dance is over and they get to the stage and can't yammer on about "Free Speech!", what ideas are they championing? Pretty stupid ones, and ones we've heard before, back in the 20s   30s, actually. Particularly for a group that are largely under-employed and ill-suited for the latter half of our 21st century. They are going to be *so* hosed once the Mercers, Koches, Trumps and the like have no more use for them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you edit and rephrase your question? You're making a **huge** accusation with **no** rational and supported basis. Also, if you click thru to the site, then their FAQ (which given the phat claim you make, you should at least bother the click), [you'll see](https://www.haveibeencompromised.com/faq)

**How do I know that you're not harvesting my email for phishing attacks or spam?**

HIBC was designed to assist and prevent individuals from becoming further victims of cyber crime. We aim to do this by delivering the platform that we are offering without any interest in profit in any shape or form. We have no intentions to harvest emails and have not built our platform in such a way to do so. However, it is virtually impossible for us to prove that these are our real intentions. If you are still worried, you should probably avoid using our platform.

Also, consider the fact that we identify over 10,000 emails on a daily basis. One or two email accounts is useless to us, not to mention the fact that we most likely already have your email(s) stored in our database. If we were to harvest your email addresse(s) to sell to spammers, we would require a significant amount of email addresses to be profitable. It's evident to note that almost every online service requires your email address (most of the time, they require a whole list of personal details).

~~We could remove it since it's spreading FUD w/o foundation but we'd *really* prefer you to rephrase it in a more neutral and constructive way.~~ 

Thanks!

*Edit:* Downvoting isn't really addressing the problem. If you'd like, I can post a better version of your question w/o the /r/conspiracy overtones (Rule #15 violation  *hint!*), but I'd prefer not to. The thing is, you do raise a fair question  but it's going to be buried in down votes and this response is too good to be taken down with it. :) </TEXT>

The good news is, we beat them back before, we'll do it again!

You can contact FCC chairman Ajit Pai and let him know what you think by emailing him: Ajit.Pai@fcc.gov. You can also call the FCC at 1-888-225-5322. At the prompt, press 1, then 4, then 2, then 0 to be connected to an agent and file a complaint.

And, /u/ ]DidjaNoit added in [an /r/technology post](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/67slg5/the_fight_for_net_neutrality_is_officially_back_on/),

I feel like a broken record, because I've posted this thought before, but DO NOT send emails to the FCC. [It's the third worst thing, by far, after mailed letters and phone calls] Type up a letter saying "This is what the future looks like without Net Neutrality and privacy on the internet". Print ten (or a hundred) copies and put them in the mail. One person at the FCC can ignore hundreds of emails, but they won't be able to ignore hundreds of letters being delivered by the postman. Here is the address:

Ajit Pai, Chairman

Federal Communications Commission

A problem I see with the OP's sincere post is that I'm certain others on the opposite side will claim the opposite, then the PTIO Mods   Burung are investing a lot of time parsing through that, as well as learning an entire new area of (dense, highly fluid, opaque) expertise.

I get that loosely speaking, these alternatives are more private. But like veering into paid VPN providers, they quickly spin out of control.

How about covering them as a category ("Bit currencies are grand for those informed people okay with the volatility, and here are some Subs   Links!") but not anything more in-depth? </TEXT>

So we're clear, it was never about free speech. It wasn't "free" but sponsored by the usual cabal of Koch brothers types. And even the shadowy corporate   right wing financiers of Coulter's stuttering ragefest looked at this and said, "Nope  too stupid and pointless, even for us."

And of course, even after decades of Coulter grifting tens of millions of dollars from gullible audiences, when it comes to her "principles", they're not worth her springing the $300 to buy her own damned airline ticket.

Not that I have any sympathy for the Neo-Nazis, but if I were them, I'd feel even more stupid (than usual) after being played by this cackling scarecrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, HIBC 

It's good you've developed your site. I'd suggest something to put in a text post, explaining more and especially, the work you've done on the privacy policy and the like.

Think of who's reading it (and why they'd care). Also (no offense) why should they trust you (and how can they verify this)? The safety you have for PII visitors give you, which I really liked. It can't hurt to have a question ready for, How is this different than HaveYouBeenPwnd.

Also, be sure to check w/ your site during the IAMA. There is a report that someone saw this then was irked that they didn't get a response back after they left their email address. Expect some traffic and the extra scrutiny that comes with it. :)

Everyone else, we're helping HaveIBeenCompromised. It's a new site but we over at /r/Privacy agreed to let him have a three-day IAMA there. /u/HIBC2017 was very forthcoming when he was around answering questions before, so we hope you'll ask him anything that you'd like to.

Also, please ask questions over in /r/Privacy once his IAMA begins. And also, do **not** pose questions nested inside questions. Each should be its own parent thread. :) </TEXT>

Our discussion started because of /u/DarkGamer's curious use of "American middle-class kids" w/in the context of Oakland teens swarming a train. G'head, check it out again I'll wait. 

Why did you use "American"? Last time I visited/checked, neither Europe, Asia, Africa or even Antartica were rife with roving "wilding gangs" of adolescent commuter train robbers. Seems a curious addition. Why?

I said American because I'm not familiar with commuter train robbing frequency in other countries. It could be common in some places for all I know.

Once we're back to comparisons w/in the US, then we're back to the original question/issue. That there is a double-standard with how people of color are represented in the corporate media and that /u/DarkGamer is being either naive or "cute" when taking the "we're all post-Racial" line. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a story that Sam Biddle mentions, from someone who worked for a company that considered buying Unroll.me, then [posted about it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14180463) in Hacker News. Unbelievably immoral over-reach paired with recklessly substandard security. With a history of screwing over their own employees' stock options via diluting them on the eve of the buy-out, so the execs could made even more money.

Almost as bad as Uber is, which is the gold standard for evil companies.

I worked for a company that nearly acquired unroll.me. At the time, which was over three years ago, they had kept a copy of every single email of yours that you sent or received while a part of their service. Those emails were kept in a series of poorly secured S3 buckets. A large part of Slice buying unroll.me was for access to those email archives. Specifically, they wanted to look for keyword trends and for receipts from online purchases.

The founders of unroll.me were pretty dishonest, which is a large part of why the company I worked for declined to purchase the company. As an example, one of the problems was how the founders had valued and then diluted equity shares that employees held. To make a long story short, there weren't any circumstances in which employees who held options or an equity stake would see any money.

I hope you weren't emailed any legal documents or passwords written in the clear.

And in the comments, someone dissects unroll.me's claim that they "don't store your personal information on any of our servers", pointing out, of *course* they don't. Since they use AWS, they store all your PII on *Amazon's* servers.

*Evil.* </TEXT>

More broadly regards "American middle-class kids", most of the US public don't hear of "Wilding Gangs", it's because when White teens riot, it's "Misguided adolescent sports fans get a bit too rambunctious".

<TEXT> There are many whizzy CSS features that folks think of, but I Mod for several Subs that are more activist and try pushing traffic to non-profits like ACLU, EFF, FFTF, and more. Rather than cutting deserving groups or drowning them in long 4" lists of worthwhile causes, pushing them traffic, we use drop down menus.

We also do stylistic things to make our stickies and posts stand out.

We'll lose these without CSS. So while some of the snazzier aspects of CSS get attention, less flashy implementations are also vital. Features that probably won't make the cut if ranked, thus will never be added to the Admin alternative. This hurts charities and non-profits that rely on us to help them.

So, something else for /u/Spez to consider.

Hey, Mods that moderate Subs that also do community/activist/charity work, are there other CSS features you use? Add them in replies since it shows it's not "just" visual effects (not that there's anything wrong with that!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's also the fact that different Subs with different focuses have different Must-Have CSS features.

A lot of my Subs are activist/non-profit oriented and we like hyping them for awareness and support. We use drop-down menus. Otherwise we'd have to triage many deserving non-profit groups or make them get lost in 4" of lists. So for us, drop-downs are a must-have. For many other Subs, understandably, it'd be deferrable. CSS gives freedom for each Sub to decide which features are must-have without dragging all of us into a lowest-common-denominator funnel. </TEXT>

Do you mind if we link to it for our announcement supporting /r/ProCSS? It's a work of art.

I'm pretty sure /r/NSALeaks will be going forward with a META post supporting ProCSS and I have two pending ModMails for /r/Privacy   /r/Privacytoolsio to ensure we have consensus (I'm betting, Hell Yes)

PS: We use drop-down menus for NSALeaks which are a gods-send for sites   subs we like but don't want 4" of clutter. That's another key CSS element we'll lose, for those reading.

<TEXT> I have deep concerns that dragging everything down to the lowest common denominator that a 4" screen can support will kill the experience for web users. Just a few Subs off the top of my head are /r/Diablo, /r/ASOIAF, almost all the gaming and SciFi Subs, etc.

Animations, custom palettes, graphics, etc., add character and it'd be a shame to throw away these simply so multi-tasking, borderline ADD-diagnosed commuters will be assured they're not missing anything special.

There are also functional CSS features that are unlikely to survive.

So, please consider keeping two tracks, one for the 4" screen folks and one for those that use Reddit on larger, more capable screens.

Thanks!

*Edit:* OMGosh, drop down menus. I didn't realize our drop-down menus were CSS features until a fellow Mod informed me. DROP-DOWN MENUS. Seriously, we'll want to die without these.

/u/Mlahk7, one of the Mods for /r/FinalFantasy, has [an amazing post describing how CSS makes their Sub fantastic](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/67508m/meta_admins_have_announced_that_they_will_be/). Well worth visiting.

<TEXT> There's also stuff that doesn't make sense until you think it through.

"Stupid regulations" like needing a badge to access airports. TYRANNY! 

Except I remember when I could use short-term parking or even those phone-friendly lots to wait 20m to swing over to SFO to pick up a friend. Cities planned that and negotiated with airports to make it happen because, at scale, it makes a LOT of sense and provides a LOT of value to EVERYONE using the airport.

No more.

Now these lots are clogged w/ Uber   Lyft drivers for hours. And general traffic (already a b*tch) is exponentially worse since there are too many cars with drivers trying to pick up a single fare, making traffic a nightmare for EVERYONE.

It's a Tragedy of the Commons situation, but the worse part is, sensible and pretty brilliant planning fixed it. Until Uber came along and said, "Screw all of you, because we're going to incentivize all our drivers to screw you over. xxxooo, Uber"

There are a lot of "stupid regulations" like this. No one wants to live next to a hotel full of party-hardy guests revolving around three-day stints where they drink until they puke in the bushes, wipe their mouth, laugh then go for round two. Now we all do, thanks to Airbnb. Progress! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is because mobile platforms are a mess. You've got baseband systems, cell tower signaling, traffic analysis, a known ID via credit card payments for your service. These are the table stakes.

Then you have OSs of varying levels of security, privacy and leakiness. Versioning. Updates. ISPs messing w/ manufacturers messing with OS providers, all providing vulnerabilities. Thrown on top, whatever Apps you have are also potential problems.

VPN is better and all mobile platforms support this. I personally trust iOS over Android for the above reasons.

Don't use Mobile if your threat level is that high. Consider Silo-ing. Or a burner phone (but that's a whole different set of challenges). Consider a Wi-Fi only mobile platform if feasible. If none of these work, expect to put many hours into schooling yourself and always watching what your device is doing. </TEXT>

"We aren't Neo-Nazis, we're Alt-Right!", or

"We aren't Nazis, because  like Adolf  we *hate* Socialists!"

Yet in the end, a Wall Street billionaire is investing to increase violence on campuses. Maybe he figures he's got his, let The Hunger Games begin. Good times to be had!

[Fun fact](http://crooksandliars.com/2017/03/youll-never-guess-who-funded-milos-college): did you know that Paul Mercer (Arch-Conservative Wall Street financier) funds folks like Milo Yanni-I-Got-Kicked-Off-Twitter-then-CPAC-then-Breitbart  full-freight, all expenses  so hungry attention whores like the BCR can get them to appear at no cost? 

Yay, "Free" Speech!

 It turns out that Robert Mercer, reclusive hedge fund billionaire, also funded Milo Yiannopoulis' college bus tour, designed to dump on trans people and generally behave in a hateful way.

Why don't the Penn State Republicans see if they can get Milo booked? Seems like a *perfect* fit!

<TEXT> The EU is set to inflict a double humiliation on Theresa May, stripping Britain of its European agencies within weeks, while formally rejecting the prime ministers calls for early trade talks.

The Observer has learned that EU diplomats agreed their uncompromising position at a crunch meeting on Tuesday, held to set out the unions strategy in the talks due to start next month 

And, this tidbit goes past even my capacity to overestimate the incompetence of the Tory/Brexit negotiators and their mad rush to activate Article 50:

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Britain failed to secure the backing of any of the 27 countries for its case that trade talks should start early in the two years of negotiations allowed by article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. The position will be announced at a Brussels summit on 29 April.

Despite a recent whistlestop tour of EU capitals by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, diplomats concluded unanimously that the European commission was right to block any talks about a future comprehensive trade deal until the UK agrees to settle its divorce bill  which some estimate could be as high as 60bn  and comes to a settlement on the rights of EU citizens.

Gosh. Maybe this was why many were suggesting a follow-up Parliament vote or Referendum where perhaps maybe more than 5% of the UK public agreed this was advised? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the problem is they found that burning Vapes "at high voltage"  to levels no Vaper would do since they'd be gagging and retching at the awful, burnt aluminum taste  had these negative results. [Not at low voltages](http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/09/criticism_of_vaping_study_is_o.html)  levels of toxins were "undetectable". Note these lower voltages are the ones actually used since they produce pleasant flavor.

The PSU researchers simulated vaping at low- and high-voltage settings consistent with those on a type of commercially available vaping device. *Gases produced on the low-voltage setting contained no detectable level of formaldehyde-producing agents.* Those produced on the high-voltage setting did, and the researchers reasoned that consistently sucking on a vaping device on the high-voltage setting would create a formaldehyde-related cancer risk up to 15 times as high as smoking conventional cigarettes. 

Naturally, the high-voltage data dominated the subsequent public debate even though low-voltage vaping produced less of the formaldehyde gunk than smoking conventional cigarettes.

The study's primary critics pointed out that vapor tends to taste awful when generated at the high temperatures responsible for formaldehyde formation, which leads to real-world behavior (like not inhaling and adjusting the voltage setting) likely to prevent harm.

This is like saying, don't eat cooked meat since when using skillets heated to 1,000, the carbon build-up that results is unhealthy.

Regular cigarettes, as directed (not while burning fumes off with an arc welder) have formaldehyde plus scores of other toxic chemicals (ironically, added by Phillip/Morris and the like). Pipe tobacco, a great deal fewer (although the tar and nicotine are themselves a problem).

It's very concerning that a model like this was used by these labs. Shady. Biased (conscious or not). They aren't doing themselves any favors. Once proper, longer-term studies are done and *if* they found health risks worse than cigarettes or even breathing city air, their credibility will be shot. Spreading this FUD doesn't help them or the public. </TEXT>

It's great to take a break. If and when you come back, of course let us know if there's anything we can do.

Hope things in the analog world become more sane for you and whatever's in the way of your happiness gets better. You deserve the best! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're referring to Joe Camel and other cartoon characters, which doesn't apply here.

If anything, Vapes, rolling your own cigarettes or smoking cigars are anti-child-smoking tactics. Too much bother, expense and (in the latter two cases) require Lil' Jimmy take up puffing off raw tobacco versus cheap, convenient, ubiquitous filtered cigarettes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who strongly backed the Soda Tax, this is idiotic. Unlike the Soda Tax, it's not about modifying impressionable children's habits. Nor is it fighting off huge corporations malicious actions. This will *hurt* people, especially attacking Vaping.

1) Vapes are **vastly** preferable to cigs, and allow many long-time smokers to finally kick the far worse smoking habit. And, non-smokers, that means you benefit too.

2) Vapes allow a couple puffs then that's it. More precise doses to treat the situation, versus once a cigarette is lit, it'll be smoked to completion. Thus again healthier

3) Getting kitted up for Vapes is non-trivial for kids. It requires knowledge, effort and more importantly, more than $40 to get started. No kid is going to drop this money on a lark. Very much *unlike* cigarettes.

4) The same with flavored blunt wraps  what kid would think, "I want to take up smoking, so I guess I'll have to learn how to roll cigarettes first, then buy special flavored paper, then take those *delicious* puffs of raw, unfiltered tobacco!".

*So* stupid, harmful and misdirected. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Adding to your observation

Some folks are confused by the changing jurisdictions of the FTC   FCC. The former has these provisions but doesn't allow common carrier rules. The latter allows common carrier rules to be applied but lacks rules preventing ISPs from harvesting customers' web logs and more.

Thus, *ISPs were already under these rules,* but under a different jurisdiction. The change simply carried over this sensible rule to the new one. Which is why ISPs haven't tried spying and modifying users' Internet traffic before. That, and simple terror at the risk that making this vast info-grab would provoke a significant regulatory response and widespread consumer outcry. 

But knowing both Congress and the Executive are controlled by Republicans, their lobbyist minions figured (correctly) it was worth a shot. Sure enough: **no** Democrat voted for it in the House or Senate, while **all** Republicans voted for the ISP Spying Bill (minus ~10 GOP Reps who abstained). Then the Republican President signed it afterwards. Not a single Democrat birthed this privacy Frankenstein. I wish it were different. 

Stating these obvious facts isn't being partisan, it's being factual. If you don't like the reality, vote the Pols that made it happen out of office in 22 months, whichever party. Every single one of them, and whoever signed it into law in the Oval Office. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wait. The flag guy was cuffed? Do you know if he was arrested (or at least, driven away)?

It's blindingly obvious that, while the skater-dude was vocal, our MRA/Red Pill aficionado punched him first, cold-cocked and unprovoked, then followed up by trying to club him a couple times with a staff. Ineffectually, but still.

The gentleman was arrested last time, having assaulted a person with a weapon, the pole. Then in-between these events, arrested/detained by police during another assault. All times with ample video evidence. He's a twice-over felon. He's been making threatening noises to do the same thing in Berkeley again. And is being used as an icon by the Neo-Nazis' propaganda effort to provoke other Nazis to show up and riot here.

What does it take for police to send people like this to prison?

I'm trying to imagine some Black kid involved in three assaults w/ deadly weapon and a multi-felon background for guns, violence and robbery, making threats, all on video, and how that would turn out in, say, Ferguson. I'd imagine a *teensy* bit different.

Or for that matter, some skater-dude partial to black clothes and handkerchiefs. I mean, geezus, I recall people against clearcutting putting nails in trees in our national forests getting charged in Federal courts for felonies. </TEXT>

He's "under-employed". No word on whether his bedroom is in a basement.

Despite championing so-called law and order and espousing tough-on-crime rhetoric, the gentleman has an extensive criminal history which features convictions for felonies in Texas and California for charges including robbery, grand theft, and the purchase and possession of a shotgun and SKS military caliber rifle from an illegal arms dealer.

And, how is that flyer graphic not inciting violence?

This is almost too funny to be true, but considering who we're speaking of The flyer graphic guy is [supported by his wife](https://itsgoingdown.org/berkeley-violent-trump-supporters-merging-alt-right/). Normally, hooray! Except it's rich irony that a Red-Pill, MRA gentleman uses on a woman to support his anti-women hatred. 

Of *course* she is an Uber exec (what *is* it with that company and their supporting ~~evil~~ destructive ideas and organizations at every turn?). 

Even more typical, he apparently is trying to cheat on her (and their kid) via Tinder:

[The gentleman] is strongly supported by his partner and the mother of his child [name redacted] who works  for Uber in San Francisco. He, [redacted], and their son live in  south of San Francisco. Interestingly, screenshots showing [the gentleman's] activity on Tinder have also surfaced, and reveal that [the gentleman] has been trying to meet and date women on Tinder as recently as late February. This is very revealing of his character if he is indeed in a monogamous relationship with his partner. </TEXT>

The Feds ensure the FDIC ensures that any FDIC bank/etrc can't take deposits from dispensaries, let alone legal recreational sellers in the states that permit it. 

So it's not their being shifty that makes folks in the Rx   recreational pot industries have large amounts of cash, it's the Feds trying to muck up states' legalization efforts. Ironically, making the locales more prone to crime due to all that cash laying about.

Oakland is considering creating an independent, highly scrutinized municipal bank. Among many of the benefits would be to allow registered marijuana businesses to have someplace to deposit their cash. </TEXT>

Removing from digital channels (a phone call confirming via voice or meeting in person) is even better. If your threat profile is lower, this is good enough for many people. 

The best (and most impractical) means is a real world exchange of public keys, while checking state-issued IDs, assuming you don't know them already. Many DIY/Maker spaces and universities host key signing parties for this purpose.

What you do **not** want to do is accept someone's PK if, in their first contact (by email), they send you their PK. Or "verify" their PK by sending another email (from anywhere  email accounts are trivial to spoof or bypass). Any method that has a stranger giving you a key remotely is worse than using the public key servers. Note they may not be malicious, just sloppy. Nicely suggest another, cross-channel means.

Web of Trust can be an extra layer but then you're assuming everyone in the web is as strict as you like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So basically, if you went from you to VPN to Tor to site, path would be

(you)  (Your ISP)  (VPN many ppl using secure tunnel)  (Tor many, many more people, shuffled and bounced randomly)  (Their ISP/Ad Servers, etc)  (Site)  Round trip back.

So I suppose the advantage would be your ISP won't know you're using Tor. But ISP   VPN are still subject to legal orders so there's no protection between the two unless you use different jurisdictions. Then it's a matter of how badly the lawyers and/or entities want you. 

That is, it's a wrinkle, especially if your VPN is in a different country, since twice the orders would have to be filed. If Ernst Blofeld is relying on a VPN too much, he may as well start mixing Vodka Martinis since he'll be receiving guests soon. Moneypenny is probably safe, though. 

Assuming VPN keeps logs. If not, then adversaries would know x number of people are suspect, leaving you vulnerable to time analysis to weed out VPN users that don't match up.

I *think* that's reasonably accurate? Corrections cheerfully accepted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd imagine the lad knows a thing or two about OpSec, so I thought it'd be interesting to post here. An interesting IAMA, scope it out (click the link).

But his configuration is:

On my main machine I use QubeOS. I use Tor (via an old Dell machine) and a VPN. I set up the VPN myself and regularly set up new servers and switch them. I adopt different personas and never link anything back to my personal accounts. Just little habbits.

I have some things like my Soundcloud, Github etc that I'm not too concerned about. Stuff like that I don't mind if it's out in the open.

My machines use full disk encryption. If possible I will use public hotspots and randomly change my mac address so that no little clues are left on the router to confirm my machine connected to it.

I try to do as much as possible to keep certain things private and unlinked. I'm only human though.

I don't do anything illegal these days though, so I'm not as worried about having to hide certain bits of sensitive or incriminating data :)

Obviously, I'm not condoning (or castigating) what he did. Let's not go there. :)

But his choices are interesting ones if you're technically inclined. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's complicated, though.

The first, best defense against hostile penetration attempts and DDOS (etc) is to *briefly* hold onto logs so, say if something weird happens, admins can call up the last x days' activity to see if persons or Bots were probing, how, and how far they got.

But as you note, there are trade-offs where with equal validity, folks could say, No logging, ever!

It's a continuum and where in that axis to set your pike down is a judgement, not an indictment. 

Some VPNs do as you say. But then it leaves them open to not spotting being taken over by a hostile party who can then monitor what's going on. And sure, there are counter-counter measures, and counter-counter-counter measures. Etc. Which, since they're more complicated, are also more vulnerable. Crazy, right?

NetSec is *hard*. And VPNs are yummy targets for Black Hats   agencies. This is known.

Again, I'm not a VPN/NetSec expert, but these *choices* aren't evidence of malice.

Of course, I agree with your larger point  if people want No Logs Ever, chose a VPN that does that. That's why I like /u/ThatOnePrivacyGuy's VPN Guide so much. He says, "I'm not you so I can't choose  but here's the best info for you to make the best choice for *you*!" </TEXT>

Even if he's confirmed as the Doctor Mengele of the Barbie world, and even is he had some connection (unknown, unstated, uncited) to the VPN, if you're their customer, big whoop.

That's a problem I have with a lot of /u/tweIph's assertions. Even at best, some of his most relevant claims come down to judgement calls that are valid but not ones he chose. Welcome to NetSec, pardner, you'll be seeing a lot of that!

IIRC correctly, only 2 were insta-banned and that was because it was *really* egregious or when we nicely asked them to be a freaken human being, they told us to piss off.

25 accounts total in 6 months and these 100 karma accounts are spammers or bots.

Except for the bots, IIRC 80% of the bans are temp ones to let them cool off. 

Which, for 86K users, is crazy-low. We've got a really *awesome* crowd of subscribers. More often than not, the Don't Be A Jerk rule violators are flagged by them and we're simply, nicely following up.

<TEXT> Uhh, I'm strongly against this. Not because anyone gives a crap what I say, but I want us to have a direct channel to anyone that wants to contact us over any issue, using any language they want, and their main account.

We get (and approve!) a lot of posts made by folks concerned enough about their privacy that even the most innocuous topic we have to manually approve. And that's *groovy!* If they're that worried someone will find out that, say, they're considering encrypting their hard drive, they'd be even more so if they had a Sub issue they wanted to discuss with us.

I don't want to have *anyone* thinking of raising an issue with us and not know it's between them and us Mods.

That said, we often discuss issues with that person included, for transparency's sake. Instead of keeping them out of the loop (Mods can do that in our Mod convos). And when appropriate, we move it on-stage here, but only after checking w/ participants that it's okay. Even when we know it's okay, we still confirm (like, Mods w/ each other).

Besides, for the most part, it's *really* boring, guys   gals. Anything worth it, especially Mod Super-Power stuff (banning, suspensions and the like) we post publicly, hopefully the reasons why.

Asking honestly: has anyone ever asked us something and we didn't reply? *Ever?* No? Didn't think so.

It's been a while, so I thought I'd give a quick refresher.

If someone is gathering data, someone else will try to warrant, subpoena, buy or steal it. Sometimes they'll make a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure out of which combos they'll use. Exciting! As Edward Snowden's early leaks noted, and Glenn Greenwald   others passed on, [Collect it all](https://www.democracynow.org/2014/5/13/collect_it_all_glenn_greenwald_on) is their mantra.

I will say, whatever admins decide, they should be super-transparent then follow through with what they say. And if they change things (as it looks like they did here), then they should communicate that change, and why.

I'm still **really** confused over your outrage that a company with HK servers has the **audacity** to not offer service for Chinese customers. You **do** realize what an insane security threat that would be for any of these Chinese citizens? Are you aware that HK has a vibrant, and protesting, and at-risk, community?

I'm trying to see what the issues are and I'm drawing a blank.

*I want to stress VPNs are not part of my expertise and I have no role for PTIO choosing whichever VPNs are on the PTIO list!*

* The story of the Canadian fugitive (cocaine smuggler AND animal (sex) liberation enthusiast? Really? Choose one!) arrested doesn't mention VPNs having a role in his being charged, but his real world activities getting him busted.

~~* Another story mentions the VPN server is in Hong Kong and the service not being available in China. That's not a strike against the VPN, that's good practices.~~

* Another charge is that a VPN was hiding that they kept (temp?, pretty sure) logs but this was known, including in high-profile blogs like TorrentFreak. They no longer keep logs past when the user disconnects, but when they did, they were transparent about it. Nothing shady or hidden, simply a trade-off in which threat(s) the VPN wanted to prepare for

* Another sent an alert to their users that one of their customers sent them a notice that one of their users was using the service and if the abuser/girl stalker didn't cut it out and leave the service, the VPN would start a tracing program on *one* server to find them and eject them. The abuser saw the alert, apologized to the VPN, and left them before they started the trace. No police involved. I gotta say, that's a win.

* The last had a server seized. They kept temp logs for a number of days to counter DDOS attacks. The seized server included the bomb threats (thus multiple threats against a school were (stupidly, and wrong) made). This seems a bit grayer since there's legitimate uses to briefly keep logs for network admin purposes, and didn't count on a server being seized. Perhaps they should have noted temp logs were kept? But kids, don't send bomb threats to schools (jerks!!) and if you do (jerks!!!), learn better OpSec? Freaken' Casual?

Am I missing something, or is there no big betrayal here? No real violation?

Please don't flame  as I said, I'm not The VPN Guy. Asking as a VPN Casual. Charges seem unwarranted, unproven, a stated violation handled privately according to published norms and a possible problem being entirely clear on where in the balance between network admin protocols vs 0 logging not being explicit enough.

<TEXT> Dude with respect, try to stop typing like you're Vanilla Ice or Eminem.

DDOS *is* no joke. And that's only the lowest tier of hacks that even the dumbest script kiddie can do. And anyone providing internet services, including VPNs, have grown-assed adults who (hopefully) know their stuff trying to strike the right balance between different kinds of threats. You don't seem to understand there's a continuum going on.

Besides, I don't understand your BlackVPN critique. ~~They have servers in HK. They don't offer service in China. That's your "expose".~~

~~**But if they did, these servers would put their HK customers at risk of death or imprisonment.**~~

~~That's not bad, that's super-responsible. Kudos.~~

*Edit: okay, this is a fast-breaking issue and the claims were murky and poorly phrased   cited. So, lemme try again*

/u/BlackVPN pointed out that they kept connection logs (temp ones? But I won't say since I got things confused last time. Maybe they can clarify?) Security (required for privacy, required for anonymity) is a series of trade-off. Reasonable people may put themselves on different places on an axis of a given issue. No malice simply *a* preference. Regardless, it was open and declared in a high profile blog, TorrentFreak. Nothing shady going on:

In the past we used to keep connection logs with timestamps of when people connected and disconnected from our service. Now we delete that information when they disconnect.

You can find TorrentFreak articles where we openly admitted to keeping these connection logs. We were always completely honest about this.

So we have *a* guy saying he wants no tracking (which leads to other vulns). He suggested BlackVPN was hiding something when they were transparent. He also made many other questionable claims in the same post, which muddied the waters. 

What he may see as a conspiracy, others might see as striking a balance between a host of competing security threats.

If security was easy, everyone would be doing it without our help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And it should be pointed out, to you and other VPNs' defense, there are legitimate server/admin reasons to keep temporary logs. Nothing nefarious going on. Like anything, the further one goes in one extreme, the more of a deficit you're opening yourself up to in the other.

DDOS is no joke. Just a couple weeks ago, seems like nearly half the Internet was taken out by that IoT DDOS attack.

So, folks, remember VPNs may be on different points on the line for different kinds of security, but it's a judgement call, not an indictment or proof of bad intensions.

Update: it looks like [we're gravitating to this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/63sylu/remove_some_vpn_providers/) as the best one to discuss this. So, I'll check in to this one, but folks, try to migrate to this new one so we have all discussion in one central place. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple focus on privacy, service *and* price, though. 

The EFF [had an IAMA last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/) and one of the questions was, [Can a group of people valuing their privacy get together and become their own ISP? Would it be better for privacy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/dffgeok/)

Also, [Is there a list of service providers that are the safest to use/ones that condemn the bill?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/dfgi45r/)

There are a number of Indy ISPs that exist that do, and a site that lets you see if there's one around you. Check it out!

Actually, check out the entire IAMA  a lot of really good responses there.

Regards IPSs vs sites monitoring you, the key difference is a browser plug in (or simply not visiting the site) allow consumers the ultimate opt-out. Short of technical solutions (VPN and the like), the only response to ISP spying is not using the Internet. That duck won't quack! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many well-intentioned FLOSS   community efforts fail because they become resource or cash black holes. So it's perfectly fine  healthy and better our our community, even  to think about how to keep things viable. Creators need to consider this and their audiences need to accept it when it works. I'd think so long as projects are open, transparent and choose mechanisms that can't be seen as conflicting with the mission, it's good to think about.

<TEXT> Siloing would be a good first step. Only log into Work Google when working. Ideally only on a work computer. Failing that, a work browser. 

Never check anything else linking your work ID with your social ones, especially if you use other Google services. If you're allowed a browser extension, use one of the blockers to deactivate all the plug-ins (you can relax a bit on logging into unrelated services like Reddit if you do this).

As you note, scripts are browser-wide, so tabs are no protection. Private browsing will protect you from site-side monitoring (if a co-worker can check out your browser history) but not server-side (Google knowing you translated tentacle porn Manga using Google Translate).

Using separate browsers has the advantage of being able to remember, too. Most OpSec failures are because of what happens behind the keyboard.

Regards VPNs, make sure it's yours. If it's theirs, they own the admin   monitoring privs. Treat it as though you are at work.
 
Regards phone, if it's yours then say your significant other is creeped out in case your work gets hacked and they take over *the very same phone that is in your bedroom* and pervs can watch. It doesn't have to be a real threat, or one you're making.

The only difference? The telecomm companies are concentrated due to their being protected oligopolies, insanely wealthy (same reasons) and so they can pay their lobbyist armies more to bribe their politicians better. But they can't bribe all their customers  in fact they're doing the opposite, ensuring we all pay more.

Oh  see if your area has alternative ISPs. Many places do and are countering this attack by pointing out they'd never do it. Municipal broadband is another promising alternative to these oligopolies. Hurt them where it counts until the 2018 elections: in their pocketbook. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're confusing changing jurisdictions of the FTC   FCC. The former has these provisions but doesn't allow common carrier rules. The latter allows common carrier rules to be applied but lacks rules preventing ISPs from harvesting customers' web logs and more.

Thus, *ISPs were already under these rules,* but under a different jurisdiction. The change simply carried over this sensible rule to the new one. Which is why ISPs haven't tried spying and modifying users' Internet traffic before. That, and simple terror at the risk that making this vast info-grab would provoke a significant regulatory response and widespread consumer outcry. 

But knowing both Congress and the Executive are controlled by Republicans, their lobbyist minions figured (correctly) it was worth a shot. And to Hell with consumer-proles. Losers!

But I'm pretty sure you already knew that, right?

<TEXT> In essence, all user data from the site was until now controlled by its European entity, SoundCloud Limited. From May onwards, data from users in the US will be transferred to the United States subsidiary, SoundCloud Inc.

The firm also goes on to state that this move will allow them to "provide those users with a more personalized SoundCloud experience".

This is EULA-ese for, "We want to monetize the Hell out of your Yankee address but the EU laws won't permit it".

EU has stronger privacy protections, particularly commercial ones, than the US. Especially for sharing with third-parties without notification or consent. That is, SoundCloud is **shredding** the privacy of its US users, not improving them.

They do note that they decide which jurisdiction to use based on the location of the IP address used to register an account. So, if you prefer to be under EU rules (you do), use your VPN to "become Greek," say. Create an account. Then transfer from old to new. Then delete your old account. Only use the new "European" one. 

Irony alert: this probably will cost SoundCloud more because it may mean they will try bouncing your Yankee bits across the Atlantic before bouncing them back to play them stateside.

<TEXT> Reasonable people may differ on the wisdom of using products from a company like Apple putting millions of very smart engineering hours to [ensuring their customers' privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) or vastly smaller teams with more modest budgets trying to reach similar goals.

I'm okay with Apple. Then again, I'm not a Jeremy Scahill, Glenn Greenwald or Laura Poitras.

I don't trust companies who make money by selling your data or have a longstanding, cooperative relationships with governments. That rules out Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. We expect (and want) Apple to respond to legal demands, but we also want them to fight for our privacy and resist sweeping ones. 

We also have to be careful with panaceas like "Always FLOSS". Because, Heartbleed, and numerous other vulnerabilities that crop up. Which is *fine*. It happens. It's found. It's fixed. Much like what happens with closed-source. The extra wrinkle is Trust. Do I trust Microsoft, the telecomms, Facebook or Uber? Hell the Hell no. *I* trust Apple. *For me,* and *my* threat profile, that works. But not for everyone else.

General rule for all devices  local backups. Encrypt everything. Don't jailbreak (if on iOS, if you are on Android, do root but do it under the watchful eye of savvy friends at first). Do update. Be leery of third-party Apps (but not paranoid). The higher your Threat Profile, the more things you need to ratchet up. 

It's a lot easier to do this under the Apple ecosystem, which means it'll get done by millions more than Android. That's safer. Getting into that sliver of a sliver of people who download a custom, hardened mobile OS then swap ROMs is great if you're in that 12%. But what practical use is that for the other 98%?

As Snowden, Schneier and many others point out, these days if the solution is something everyone can't use, it's not a good solution. We need better ones.

Mobile using cellular is such a jerry-rigged mess that if you have one, consider it a vulnerability: the baseband stuff and the like. So to an extent, we're arranging angels on the head of a pin.

On the other hand, I have friends who are 100% FLOSS. This is fine, too. We're happy with each others' choices since we recognize we're both sensible people applying different threat profiles and judgement to our individual situation.

Doing *something* is far better than doing nothing.

So you're right for your profile. I'm right for mine. Reasonable people can disagree. But we need solutions that *everyone* can use, otherwise we're *all* vulnerable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except for the simple fact that under a Blue President (a *very* problematic one that I've railed against his entire eight years), the FCC took over jurisdiction *and* brought over the FTC ruling so the FCC could enforce it. They made it illegal before the ISPs could even begin. Done and done. Finished. Oops, almost.

I try not to make partisan statements while here but in this case, it's observational: Democrats made possible a ban on ISPs spying on their locked-in customers, Republicans reversed it then pumped up these kinds of widespread privacy violations with the legislative equivalent of steroids, amphetamines and 7% cocaine-in-solution.

The vote breakdown speaks volumes. Not only that, they did it in under two months. This shows what a priority this was for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, "percentage root android os" on DDG gets these two, both anecdotal and with sampling problems but both under 1%. Also note it's "root" and not "custom Android OS" or "replacing ROMs". That is, folks who want to delete *Verizon Presents: Even Angrier Birds* are part of the group versus cypherfreaks like you and me.

[What percentage of Android phones are rooted?](https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-Android-phones-are-rooted): Indian engineer at a computer engineering school found 0.6% of rooted (note above qualification, and *whoo boy*, sampling problems galore) Android phones.

[How many rooted Android devices are there?](https://www.quora.com/How-many-rooted-Android-devices-are-there): 

A study would need to be commissioned for anything near usefully accurate numbers, but if you use the official statistics of devices that have opted to report using the popular and widely available Cyanogenmod family of ROMs and then pad that with non-reporting devices and the multitude of other ROMs available, perhaps "over one million" isn't out of the realm of possibility?

That said, the latest figures from Google (link I'm too lazy to include  click thru if you're curious) puts that million-plus in perspective and suggests that that rooted devices account for some amount that barely scratches the heels of 1%.

I did a proprietary study that had fractions of 1%, with custom ROMs a surprisingly large 10% of this figure. But I'm uncomfortable getting too specific (it was a bitch of a project that someone paid for). So I'm fine if you don't accept this beyond Some Guy On The Internet making the claim in this paragraph. :)

Of course, everyone is welcome to find better stats. Have at it, Reddit! Share with the rest of us! :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a tragical farce. First ~~AT T~~ Verizon tries ramming their spyware on a model of an Android model, most likely as a test before wall-to-wall installation. Then EFF writes about it literally the day of, which one day after the House Republicans voted to nuke the FCC rules against doing this. Then AT T pointed out it was only a test run on a single model (so far). So EFF modified their Deep Links article.

However, the EFF did bother reading the T C, and what they found was just as scary as their initial story. From the EndGadget article:

But the EFF spent a little time staring at AppFlash's privacy policy, where it's revealed that the software will vacuum up any and all of your private data. For instance, it'll snag your cell number, device type, operating system and the apps or services that you use. More crucially, the app will also harvest the details of everything installed on your device, your location and the contact details of everyone in your phonebook.

Verizon admits that the **information will be shared** within "the Verizon family of companies," including that of (Engadget parent) AOL. From there, the data will be used to "provide more relevant advertising within the AppFlash experiences and in other places." The other places being a euphemism for banner and display advertising all across the web.

So, if you're trying for a baby and you've got a fertility app on your phone, it's reasonable to expect plenty of banner ads for diapers and formula feeding. If you're doing something more private, like making your first steps out of the closet or dealing with a substance abuse issue -- and you've got a relevant app -- then Verizon's gonna know about it.

<TEXT> Won't happen. Never will. It's core to Apple's mobile identity. Remember, Apple the first manufacturer that insisted they, not the ISPs, control their platform. Forcing AT T into the deal, then making the others comply as well.

That's why when folks ask me which mobile phone is best for security, it's a no-brainer. Especially if they're not part of that tiny sliver of a sliver of people who swap ROMs for fun, or even, wipe then clean-install a custom OS. We're talking 0.01% and 0.2% type numbers, respectively.

Many other [experts agree](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/goodbye-android). Just on updates and upgrades alone. Let alone ISPs having veto rights and variant OSs. And their horrible model fragmentation. Or even the fact that agencies don't even bother suing Android/ISP creators to create a GovtOS for them  what the customers already use fits the bill nicely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's worth also including Glenn Greenwald's editorial, [To Serve AT T and Comcast, Congressional GOP Votes to Destroy Online Privacy](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/29/to-serve-att-and-comcast-congressional-gop-votes-to-destroy-online-privacy/), particularly this quote:

Its hardly rare for the U.S. Congress to enact measures gutting online privacy: indeed, the last two decades have ushered in a legislative scheme that implements a virtually ubiquitous Surveillance State composed of both public intelligence and military agencies along with their private-sector partners. Members of Congress voting for these pro-surveillance measures invariably offer the pretext that they are acting for the benefit of American citizens  whose privacy they are gutting  by Keeping Them Safe.

But what distinguishes this latest vote is that this pretext is unavailable. Nobody can claim with a straight face that allowing AT T and Comcast to sell their users browser histories has any relationship to national security. **Indeed, theres no minimally persuasive rationale that can be concocted for this vote. It manifestly has only one purpose: maximizing the commercial interests of these telecom giants at the expense of ordinary citizens. Its so blatant here that it cannot even be disguised.**

Thats why, despite its devastating harm for individual privacy, there is a beneficial aspect to this episode. It illustrates  for those who havent yet realized it  who actually dominates Congress and owns its members: the corporate donor class.

There is literally no constituency in favor of this bill other than these telecom giants. Itd be surprising if even a single voter who cast their ballot for Trump or a GOP Congress even thought about, let alone favored, rescission of privacy-protecting rules for ISPs. So blatant is the corporate-donor servitude here that theres no pretext even available for pretending this benefits ordinary citizens. **Its a bill written exclusively by and for a small number of corporate giants exclusively for their commercial benefit at the expense of everyone else.** </TEXT>

Also making it all available on a website, with all the extra work that entails.

The recent law allowing ISPs to spy on all their customers if it makes them even more money has turned your ISP to a big part of everyone's threat model: if they're collecting and tracking your every activity online so their execs can buy that third vacation home, it means someone else can use it too (hackers, plaintiffs, authorities, other nations' authorities)

Largely, a reliable VPN is your best defense against this threat.

<TEXT> *The Intercept's* Sam Biddle has an article, above, that raises a point that the ISP folks raise over and again. Since Facebook watches everything you do and they make money this way, why can't we make money this way, in addition to our traditional, oligopoly rent-taking way? That's more fair and don't you believe in fairness?! And, Our industry remains committed to offering services that protect the privacy and security of the personal information of our customers!

Sam asks them, 

How does the sale of ISP browsing history to advertisers improve customer privacy?

[Lobbyist Overlord] Howard Waltzman, replied, Id turn the question around a little bit: Today the norm for the entire rest of the internet ecosystem is that edge providers, advertisers are able to share non-sensitive information on an opt-out basis The question is, why would you have different rules for ISPs in that regard?

This response was akin to those provided by Sims and the NCTA, eager to point out that edge providers  content companies, in regulatory speak  like Facebook are already selling your information to advertisers, so why cant your ISP, too? Which is a great point, actually, but not one that explains how you can reconcile a commitment to customer privacy with the commodification of that customers browsing habits.

It's actually a lousy point. If I use Facebook (hahaha!), what I do *on Facebook* is slurped up then blended   spindled so my bits can be sold to teeming millions. Hey, Zuckerberg needs to level another couple square blocks of the SF Mission district for his sixth home  I get it.

But. I can *choose* not to visit Facebook. Or Google. Or Ashley Madison. Yahoo! My doctor. My lawyer. My drug dealer. (*Kidding!*  I don't have a lawyer).

If someone I know  who is definitely *not* me but is a friend, so I'm speaking for him  visits a pr0n site, *totally by mistake,* Facebook won't know. 

My ISP, on the other hand, will know. And they'll know about any Internet of Things devices, any smart TVs, devices and any guests. They'll know when I'm home and much of what I do while at home. (Well, technically, they won't since we're taking counter-measures but we're not most people).

Don't believe the lobbyist overlords' lies, in other words. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reasonable people may differ on the wisdom of using products from a company like Apple putting millions of very smart engineering hours to [ensuring their customers' privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) or vastly smaller teams with more modest budgets trying to reach similar goals.

I'm okay with Apple. Then again, I'm not a Jeremy Scahill, Glenn Greenwald or Laura Poitras.

I don't trust companies who make money by selling your data or have a longstanding, cooperative relationships with governments. That rules out Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. We expect (and want) Apple to respond to legal demands, but we also want them to fight for our privacy and resist sweeping ones. 

General rule  local backups. Encrypt everything. Don't jailbreak. Do update. Be leery of third-party Apps (but not paranoid). The higher your Threat Profile, the more things you need to ratchet up. 

Mobile using cellular is such a jerry-rigged mess that if you have one, consider it a vulnerability: the baseband stuff and the like.

On the other hand, I have friends who are 100% FLOSS. This is fine, too. We're happy with each others' choices since we recognize we're both sensible people applying different threat profiles and judgement to our individual situation.

Doing *something* is far better than doing nothing.

That said, the threat in this case is your ISP. And the only defense for that would be a VPN, Tor or TAILS, in ascending order of sacrifice. Using a VPN on your iDevices or Mac is a simple configuration issue. OpenVPN for MacOS and there's built-in support for VPNs in your iPhone   iPad Preferences panel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ditto, plus one!

I'll also include [a comment made by the founder of an independent ISP](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/). Sonic.net, a California independent ISP, in this case. They compete on service and price, but also ethical things like providing their users more privacy. You're also striking a blow against these entrenched oligopolies by supporting independents.

Dane Jasper (/u/danejasper) urged people to try finding and supporting one in your area.  

I'll echo Jeremy's response here, in particular the point about selecting a competitive ISP. There are hundreds of smaller regional carriers around the US, and finding one in your area that has strong privacy practices and a stance on network neutrality is a good way to both protect yourself, and to vote with your wallet.

While it has not been updated in the last couple years, a good place to start is the national broadband map: https://www.broadbandmap.gov/

Also check carrier and wireless ISP trade association membership for your area, for example [FISPA](http://www.fispa.org/where-we-are/) and [WISPA](http://www.wispa.org/Directories/Member-Directory) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's funny when I see this comment. And I see it a *lot* because the telecomm companies' lobbyists spent millions to get the Republicans to pass this bill for them. I'd be a bit miffed if I discovered I had been suckered by lobbyist PR campaigns, but that's me. 

The short version is ISPs being reclassified as a common carrier so sensible, additional rules could be enforced following a Supreme Court case forcing the change. This moved jurisdiction from the FTC to the FCC. The FTC has rules preventing ISPs from taking advantage of their privileged, oligopoly status to surveil and alter their customers' web traffic in pernicious ways. The FCC required new rules (thus that's where the claim that "nothing has changed" come from). 

ISPs were very sensibly prevented from manipulating customers' internet traffic under FTC jurisdiction. These rules don't exist under FCC jurisdiction. It's *really* important ISPs aren't allowed to manipulate customers' internet traffic: common sense, right? Would *you* want someone else watching and manipulating **all** *your* internet traffic? Why not?

So, your talking point is technically correct. It is also wrong, since the switch from FTC to FCC required a change. It's a misleading talking point foisted by the telecommunications oligopolies. Since they **are** under this new jurisdiction, **new** rules, to ensure ISPs operate under the **same** rules the ISPs happily operated under before, are required. Which the Senate Republicans shot down.

Lots of really good background, facts and strategies going forward, including choosing alternate ISPs that won't monitor/manipulate your web traffic, VSPs you can trust and Tor (and the trade-offs for each).

It's a *major* drag we couldn't convince the Republican House to grow a pair, have a conscience and represent someone besides those ten-odd lobbying groups that bought them off for peanuts, but what's as important is that we fight them, yesterday, today and tomorrow. Educate your friends as well.

Note: observing that 215 Republican House Representatives voted for the bill, vs. 190 Democratic Reps (and 15 Republicans) voted against it isn't being partisan. It's being factual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the run-up to the hearing, privacy campaigners argued that ISPs should be treated differently from Google and Facebook, as in many cases consumers only have one choice of broadband provider. You can choose not to use Facebook or Googles search engine, and there are lots of tools you can use to block their tracking on other parts of the web, for example, [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) from the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org) (EFF), a nonprofit civil liberties group.

Its much harder to prevent ISPs from tracking you. To mask all of your browsing behavior you can use a VPN service (which incurs a subscription cost) or try using Tor, both of which make browsing more complicated.

Note: /u/Thatoneprivacyguy's excellent [Guide to Choosing The Best VPN For You](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/4ihtdj/that_one_privacy_guys_guide_to_choosing_the_best/) is one of the best, most objective and updated VPN guide I'm familiar with. And in general, check out /r/PrivacyToolsIO for other technology-based news and /r/Privacy for privacy-related news.

Whats the next step for privacy campaigners? The EFFs Jeremy Gillula said: Its certainly a bit of a Hail Mary, but I think wed try to convince President Trump that signing a bill that helps big corporate interests by eliminating Americans privacy and weakening their cybersecurity isnt exactly draining the swamp.

*Ha ha ha ha. Ha.* See above, protect yourself. And consider an alternate ISP if there's one in your area who refuses to engage in this uhh what's the word Privacy rape. Sonic.net is one such example, for CA. Anyone recommend any others?

If that doesnt work, then we can still try to make some headway with state legislatures; continue working to encrypt the entire web; and work harder on creating other, easy-to-use tools people can use to protect their privacy from the snooping eyes of their internet provider. </TEXT>

"Should your ISP be allowed to monitor and manipulate everything you do online when it benefits them?" is not a dog that's going to hunt.

I can't (just) blame Conservatives, since Fortune 500 handouts are why they exist. You can't blame rain for being wet. I can blame the (corporate) media as much or more.

I'd humbly counter with the point that the public right-of-ways, tax incentives and the lifting of many if not all wired telecomm regulations for mobile   broadband to "let them innovate" could be seen as corporate welfare. 

There are good reasons for these give-aways, but the beneficiaries can't now turn around and say, "**WE** built this. Now leave us alone to extract our lushly Oligopolic rents, proles!" :)

They benefited from their status as protected entities. They can't now grab all the profits as though they didn't, in other words. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This question is more for Cory, given his great books featuring chronologically-challenged humans, but if anyone would like to respond, that'd be great.

OK. Kids. By which, Tweens thru High School, maybe college.

On one hand, they've embraced The Social quite a lot. Digital even more. Not as many as I'd like are aware specifically of how invasive commercial surveillance is, especially how all the technologies work with each other to create profiles broader than kids might expect. 

I don't want to be a hectoring scold to the kids I know, yet at the same time I hate to see vulnerable people taken advantage of. On the brighter side, many kids are aware, and even more aware now, of how pervasive these techniques are. Example: a lot of kids having candids taken of them now shield their lower faces w/ their hands to stymie Facebook-style face recognition (awesome!)

A) Is there hope or should I be pessimistic of humanity's fate as they become more adult?

B) How do you suggest we reach out to them in accepted, constructive ways, and, what couple techniques would you suggest as Privacy Go-Tos to get them started? Let's narrow it down to On Mobile since that's where they live more.

Thanks! </TEXT>

This moved jurisdiction from the FTC to the FCC. The FTC has rules preventing ISPs from taking advantage of their privileged, oligopoly status to surveil and alter their customers' web traffic in pernicious ways.

ISPs were very sensibly prevented from manipulating customers' internet traffic under FTC jurisdiction. These rules don't exist under FCC jurisdiction. It's *really* important ISPs aren't allowed to manipulate customers' internet traffic: common sense, right? Would *you* want someone else watching and manipulating **all** *your* internet traffic? Why not?

So, your talking point is technically correct. It is also wrong, since the switch from FTC to FCC required a change. It's a misleading talking point foisted by the telecommunications oligopolies. Since they **are** under this new jurisdiction, **new** rules, to ensure ISPs operate under the **same** rules the ISPs happily operated under before, are required. Which the Senate Republicans shot down.

And regards, "only call if you're in a Red State", that's silly. It's one 0.5 minute phone call or fax. And tallies **are** kept. If Congress gets several thousands of calls on this issue, all members are informed and thus warned that the public is watching. It matters.

FWIW, the reason the Senate voted as they did (and only succeeding by a few votes) was because they figured with the RepubliCare going over the falls and the UK Parliament stabbing, they thought no one was watching. The House can't be afforded that luxury.

**Please [click this link to visit and post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/) your questions   comments in /r/IAMA.**

Last year, the FCC passed some pretty awesome rules that would bar your internet service provider (ISP) from invading your privacy. But last Thursday, [Republicans in the Senate have voted to repeal those rules](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/senate-puts-isp-profits-over-your-privacy). If the [House of Representatives votes the same way](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/congress-debates-reversing-course-decades-consumer-privacy-protections) and the rules are repealed, [the results for Americans privacy will be disastrous](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections).

[But we can stop them in their tracks--if we act today.](https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy)

We are:

<TEXT> There's some fuzziness since there are several Mods and we compromise and work together. But generally, the closer to FLOSS or non-profit is better, but we're not filthy hippies and embrace Capitalism, so for instance I'm okay with Apple, say. Their business is aligned with individual's privacy, creativity and autonomy. Companies like Palantir or Facebook are the opposite. I'd argue Microsoft and the ISPs are pretty close to them. Amazon, also closer. But, see, it's fuzzy.

But on the plus side, I argued that while Amazon may be lower on the privacy spectrum, this is an offer for existing Amazon customers so it's not as though it increases their surveillance. But then again, this would have to increase it at some level since they're tracking participants of the program (see: fuzzy).

Versus, say, Fight For The Future, EFF or Demand Progress pushing something, we'd almost assuredly let through. If not hype. 

But I agree: some situations aren't easy. Appreciate your head's up! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Facebook gets shifty, you don't visit Facebook.com. If Yahoo! is incompetent and gives up your years of emails, you visit them, delete all your mails, cancel your account and never return.

Likewise, Yahoo! won't get your IoT telemetry, so it can't do anything with that swell internet-connected doll's data and voices you bought your eight-year-old daughter to whisper her secrets to. Or your door, thermostat or voice-activated agent-powered devices that are designed to understand multiple streams of background conversation simultaneously.

If your ISP gets shifty, you don't use the internet. That's **it.**

That's why any sane FCC treats them differently. That's also why ISP lobbyists lobbied so hard. </TEXT>

<TITLE> An /r/Privacy Response To The Senate IPS Vote Rolling Back Our Privacy: Step Up Your Privacy Game Then Bombard Congress With Calls/Faxes (wut?) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation put it so well, [Senate Puts ISP Profits Over Your Privacy](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/senate-puts-isp-profits-over-your-privacy)

This is not good. It's awful. As the EFF notes,

The Senate just voted to roll back your online privacy protections. [Speak up now](https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy) to keep the House from doing the same thing.

ISPs have been lobbying for weeks to get lawmakers to repeal the FCCs rules that stand between them and using [even creepier ways](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections) to track and profit off of your every move online. Republicans in the Senate just voted 50-48 (with two absent votes) to approve a Congressional Review Action resolution from Sen. Jeff Flake whichif it makes it through the Housewould not only roll back the FCCs rules but also prevent the FCC from writing similar rules in the future.

That would be a crushing loss for online privacy. ISPs act as gatekeepers to the Internet, giving them incredible access to records of what you do online. They shouldnt be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase, and more without your consent.

We can still kill this in the House: [call your lawmakers today](https://act.eff.org/action/don-t-let-congress-undermine-our-online-privacy) and tell them to protect your privacy from your ISP.

Do this. Do this now. It's really important since under new Republican rules, once a FCC regulation is defeated (even by only two votes, as this was, in a time when everyone's focus was diverted by the UK Parliament attack and the House vote to kill the ACA), it can never be brought up again (*totally* not shady!). That means, once we've had a chance to catch our breath and realize what a bad idea this is, too bad. How do you like *them* democracy apples?

______

In the meantime, there are several things we can do here at /r/Privacy.

**Your ISP Is Now Part Of Your Threat Profile  Respond By Using A VPN**

VPNs block your traffic and activity from your ISP. What may have arguably been a luxury seems less so. As always, we strongly recommend /u/ThatOnePrivacyGuy's excellent [Guide To Choosing The Best VPN](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/choosing-the-best-vpn-for-you/)

**Educate Yourself On Privacy Tactics**

[Our Peerless /r/Privacy FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/index) and [the /r/PrivacyToolsIO Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/wiki/index) are great starting resources. 

/r/PrivacyToolsIO gives more hands-on advice [for fans of the site](https://privacytoolsio.github.io/privacytools.io/). 

Check them out if you haven't already.

**Share Your Knowledge With Your Fellow /r/Privacy Subscribers**

u/throwaaya9999292282e asked, What is the most encrypted (TCP/IP and DNS) set up someone can run while still being usable?

* What modem?

* What router?

* What firmware for that router?

* What DNS networks?

* Browser extensions?

* Other software?

So, add your suggestions below (no VPN ones since these recommendations are barred). 

And please, *please*, click the above links to call your House Representatives. Or Fax. 

Yeah, I know. Olds! But it's what they track. So, call, fax or write. Tweets don't cut it.

**Breaking:** The EFF just posted an article concerning the upcoming House of Representatives vote: 

[House Schedules Vote on Eliminating Consumer Online Privacy Rights Next Week  Majority Leader McCarthy Confirms House to Immediately Act on Behalf of the Cable and Telephone Industry Following the Senate Vote](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/congress-debates-reversing-course-decades-consumer-privacy-protections)

_____

**Breaking2:** The EFF is having an IAMA **this** Monday, starting at 9:00 AM PST, to get privacy advocates to call their Congressperson to vote against this bill. 

Theyve lined up a great roster of notable experts in the field:

 Cory Doctorow (Blogger, journalist, author, co-editor Boing Boing)

 Dane Jasper (CEO   co-founder, Sonic.net)

 David Segal (Executive Director, Demand Progress)

 Jeremy Gillula (Senior Staff Technologist, Electronic Frontier Foundation)

[The link is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/). Though it doesn't start until Monday, we encourage anyone to post questions before then. Then of course participate on Monday. </TEXT>

I agree, those people smugly saying "We all knew this since FOREVER" are really annoying. It's also a propaganda technique to bury news.

But yeah: The Intercept and Snowden's proofs highlighted this. And, getting to the point of my post, had Wikileaks acknowledged this, building on it instead of claiming it's breaking news, Assange would be less annoying to me. It's the hype-y aspects of most of what Assange does lately that grate. </TEXT>

The documents are mostly from last decade, except a couple that are dated 2012 and 2013.

Between the "expos" covering last decade's vulnerabilities and the fact that 3rd party shippers might individually interfere with products they get access to (something we've known since Snowden and suspected since forever) I'm beginning to think that Assange is prone to exaggeration sometimes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, of course it is. But since woman *always* have to consider the consequences, it isn't part of the baggage surrounding the poll question. Then once stripped of this context, the question can be read as more, "Should women have agency in their sexual activities or are they fetus factories?" to those of a Conservative bent. 

I'm betting the 20% of the "no" response for the woman question are due to that, whereas the 22% of the "no" for the men question are due to respondents thinking men need to be responsible when they use their willies.

Exaggerated somewhat to point out how the results shift when "men" and "women" are part of the question, of course. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But see, the meaning of the question changes if the question is, "Should men be able to have sex for pleasure without worrying about pregnancy". Most will add an additional layer of guys responsibly using birth control to the equation.

Then it's about, "Doofus  use a condom or at the least, make sure your partner is using birth control". And, "Don't be a selfish ass".

Since its the women who are stuck with the consequences of unprotected sex. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is alarming how the US government is using legal writs instead of normal, tested legal mechanisms. Writs are an untested and vague avenue. Increasingly used as a way to sidestep normal evidentiary tests. They were literally instruments used in Stage Coach days then retired until very recently. Now they're showing up everywhere.

Apple vs FBI is a great example of this. The government can't order a private company to create a leaky product resulting in that company's harm. It'd be insane for them to even try. So what did they do? They *tried* to use writs to get around this. Then tried tying it in a neat little NSL bow to prevent the company from screaming, "You're INSANE!" to the world, to shine a light on this reprehensible attack on proper constraints on intrusive government actions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, Windows is closed source and commercial as well so I'm not sure what difference it would make to the Windows user.

[The company seems legit to {the poster} and when asked {the poster} didn't edit the name out so we could discuss why commercial OSs are a legitimate thing to discuss while commercial, closed source solutions to privacy risks are not]

But a lot of people (gods help them) use Windows 10. We'd be remiss (and be one of those annoying, preachy Subs) if we only allowed Trisquel-related questions on /r/Privacy. AND CODE YOUR OWN DAMN DEVICE DRIVERS!

And, we're not that kind of Sub :)

So, OSs are okay to discuss since we're trying to support people where they are. And as I noted, it was removed with no animosity towards you or the company.

I will add, as a *personal* opinion (some of my fellow mods amiably disagree), that there are commercial OSs whose revenue model actually depends on, you know, selling you a computer. Not ads. Not spyware. Not non-anonymized user tracking. For these kinds of operating systems, your and their interests are aligned, not opposed. So [their claims for protecting your privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) are vastly more credible. 

See: honest folks may (amiably) agree to different solutions depending on their threat profiles.

PS: Can you change the mention of the name of the software to "the software" or something generic? Otherwise I'll have to remove it for the same reasons I had to remove your original mention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, their CS was quick after I sent them an email (thanks again, /u/Boondoc!). They got back to me: 

Thank you very much for being our loyal customer.  All our hard work paid off when you told us you like the Altus T1 :-)

The SHORT warning may come from  moisture conducting electricity, that made the resistance of the CVU chip lower than it is. Dry clean all parts when this happens.

The NO ATOMIZER warning will indicate conduction problem. You did the right thing by cleaning the CVU contact area carefully. You also need to clean the clips, by using fine sand paper (600~800). Try not to clean the CVU with sand paper.

You can order CVU heaters from us. $25 for two. (This may last for years)  

Have a good day.

And, I did get it working after the initial problems after cleaning the contacts (toothbrush   paste). There's also a dry-burn procedure to clean off the carbon that I haven't done yet since the actual burn is fine.

I bought my first Mod and the Altus T1 in Dec, also started making my first batches of juice. So the performance/thriftiness over 34 months is not awful. But I was worried that the CVU might be failing. But, it *is* working. So replacement rates vs traditional coils work out if it's $12 every 6+ (?) months.

So, this newer method makes using a CVU unusual vs. wire coils. It has a different replacement parts/schedule. But so far, okay. The actual burn is fine. The delays that some folks complain about isn't a bother  you just press the button a half-second before your draw. It seems to burn less and is *much* easier to replace only the cotton. Overall, I still like the approach and product.

Thanks for helping. Appreciated!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, so I got the Altus T1, by GuoVape. REALLY snazzy. I like it a lot. Recommend! It is a variable wattage coil that lets you put folds of cotton over a circuit-board heating element, so no yucky wire crimping. 

The package is also nice. A ton of replacement parts (gaskets, cotton, lil' wire things, the works!)

So, not to cast shade on them. I'm really happy.

Except the contacts to the lil' circuit board thingie are wearing and I'd like to see if I can get a replacement. Yet their site has one of those age-check things, that blocks me from accessing anything because they messed it up (at least on Safari and Firefox). I'd like to send their support folks a question, How do I get a replacement board thing?

Any ideas? I tried support@guovape.com but it bounced.

Thanks. And again, I'm not slogging on GuoVape. They're smaller so this slipped thru. But I like how they're innovating. </TEXT>

On the White Houses motives:

The Government appropriately cautions that, in determining purpose, courts should not look into the veiled psyche and secret motives of government decision-makers and may not undertake a judicial psychoanalysis of a drafters heart of hearts.

The Government need not fear. The remarkable facts at issue here require no such impermissible inquiry.

For instance, there is nothing veiled about this press release: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.

Nor is there anything secret about the Executives motive specific to the issuance of the Executive Order:

Rudolph Giuliani explained on television how the Executive Order came to be. He said: When [Mr. Trump] first announced it, he said, Muslim ban. He called me up. He said, Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally. </TEXT>

Data provided by the Department of Homeland Security shows that searches of cellphones by border agents has exploded, growing fivefold in just one year, from fewer than 5,000 in 2015 to nearly 25,000 in 2016.

According to DHS officials, 2017 will be a blockbuster year. Five-thousand devices were searched in February alone, more than in all of 2015.

This is why when the CBP rolls out "voluntary" demands for "some" social accounts and passwords, we must object then fight these demands, legally and technically.

I can't imagine this not morphing into a quagmire 5 or 10 years from now, as every government starts seizing other governments' citizens (or their assets), all willy-nilly (yes that's a legal term). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was struck by this:

The US did this in bulk under the PRTT Internet dragnet program from 2004 to 2011, and now conducts similar metadata collection overseas (as well as  in more targeted fashion  under PRISM). Mind you, the Russians got far more types of metadata than the US did under the PRTT program.

account users names; recovery email accounts and phone numbers, which users provide to webmail providers, such as Yahoo, as alternative means of communication with the provider; password challenge questions and answers; and certain cryptographic security information associated with the account, i.e. the accounts nonce

But this likely gives you an understanding of the kinds of things the US does collect overseas, as well as via the PRISM program.

So the Russian hackers were charged for US crimes for things they did in Russia. Let's exclude the boner-pill ad hacks and focus on things intelligence agencies do. Let's also exclude the fact that one of these hackers is facing treason charges so he won't be extradited. Let's assume the others might be.

1) How can a US court rule a foreign national committed a crime outside the US then bring them here. Kind of like Kim DotCom, it seems weird that a government can use international warrants to bring a suspect to a jurisdiction where something is criminal, when it isn't criminal when the crime was committed. Charging them in Russian (or New Zealand) courts for these crimes seems more fair.

2) If an act is criminal in both jurisdictions, then extradition makes more sense. Yet still, why not charge them there?

Both of these asked without malice: honestly curious - what's the ethical justification for this, or is this just an example of the US muscling over these concerns?

3) Again ignoring the boner-pill pushing, the (very bad!) hacking is something US, Chinese, British and Russian entities do. So if it's illegal for Russians to do this to US firms, would it be similarly illegal for Americans to do it to European or Asian firms (or even American firms on servers located there)? That is, why aren't these other nations filing charges for US intelligence community staff doing this to them, and filing an international extradition order to bring them to China, Russia or France?

Don't get me wrong. Hacking Yahoo! is really bad. But I'm curious of the rationalization of the US acting as it does, and wondering why other countries don't do the same thing, only targeting US citizens working for American entities. I'd imagine quite a fracas erupting if they tried.

Anyone versed on how international laws and prosecutions work care to explain? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So it seems the Vault 7 cache isn't as significant as Assange claimed and that many if not all of the vulnerabilities are addressed.

Members of the security community have dismissed Assanges hyperbole around the CIA files  collectively nicknamed Vault 7  which he described as exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective.

Ryan Kalember, SVP of Cybersecurity Strategy at Proofpoint, disagreed. Theres nothing earth-shattering, he said, pointing out that many of the operating systems mentioned in the documents are quite old and have already been updated.

It seems like the CIA was doing the same stuff cybersecurity researchers do, which is compile lists of vulnerabilities and try to figure out which ones are being exploited in the wild and which ones could be.

Its not clear at this point how many, if any, of the vulnerabilities are genuine zero-days  those not yet known to vendors, named after the number of days they have to fix them.

Kalember said that the so-called Weeping Angel hack, which uses malware to spy on Samsung smart TVs, has been shown at security conferences for a couple of years and requires physical access to the device.

The CIA should be embarrassed that they lost control of this cache, but they should also be embarrassed if this is their level of technical sophistication, said another another security researcher, who did not want to be named. What they have is pretty unimpressive.

Both said that the vulnerabilities detailed in the documents are likely to have already been patched by the companies. Apple and Google have both publicly stated this is the case 

But to Assange's credit, this time Wikileaks is approaching the companies privately instead publishing them publicly:

The fact that Julian Assange is offering to selectively disclose vulnerability information to affected companies is better than revealing it to all and sundry, but it depends on the veracity, accuracy and currency of that information, said BullGuard CEO Paul Lipman. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Note this was a bug that Google has fixed. So we have valid concerns (as always) that Google data leaks/uses across their services, but this was **not** a planned "feature", and it's been addressed.

**Do** note that the broader problem with this is, when you use multiple Google (etc.) services, their backend tracks all your activities. What's interesting in this case is that a bug revealed how integrated these silos are, even for sensitive things like, I don't know, *your entire Google search history!*

<TEXT> Facebook and Instagram have banned developers from using their data for surveillance with a new privacy policy that civil rights activists have long sought to curb spying by law enforcement.

Following revelations last year that police departments had gained special access to the social networks to track protesters, Facebook, which owns Instagram, announced on Monday that it had updated its rules to state that developers could not use data obtained from us to provide tools that are used for surveillance.

The news is a victory for civil liberties groups, which have increasingly raised concerns about mass surveillance and aggressive prosecutions of activists under Donald Trumps administration.

Its very important right now that tech companies like Facebook take a stand to be human rights champions, because otherwise theyll be used to violate human rights, said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, part of a coalition that pushed for the anti-surveillance reforms. 

As skeptical as I am about Facebook  LOTS!  any company this large making a public statement is a good thing.

I'd be *very* interested in the details, however. Since that's where all the devils reside.

Also, [Twitter blocked gov't "spy centers" from accessing user data](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/twitter-dataminr-user-data-aclu), starting in Dec '16. 

And for context, [ACLU found in Oct '16 that social media sites gave data to company tracking black protesters such as Black Lives Matter](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/aclu-geofeedia-facebook-twitter-instagram-black-lives-matter). </TEXT>

It calls for a $100 fine for emissions outside of a womans vagina, or created outside of a health or medical facility, which will be considered an act against an unborn child, and failing to preserve the sanctity of life.

It also requires the creation of a masturbatory assistance registry of not-for-profit organisations and hospitals able to provide fully-abstinent encouragement counseling, supervising physicians for masturbatory emissions, and storage for the semen.

<TEXT> Hey, OP, to improve discussion, you might want to take the summary info from Amazon for the two books and paste it here. Some folks don't click links, others don't like Amazon, still others want to minimize their being tracked.

And for other readers, what are some great books out there on privacy in general? I like 

* Glenn Greenwald's [No Place To Hide](http://www.glenngreenwald.net) as a go-to.  
* Naomi Klein's [No Logo](http://www.naomiklein.org/no-logo) is another.  
* Noam Chomsky's [Manufacturing Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) was prescient.  
* Marshall McLuhan's [Medium Is The Message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medium_Is_the_Massage) (the [PDF is here](http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf), originally from [Understanding Media,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media) likewise.  

It's not enough to realize we *want* to be more private at times. It's important to know *why* it's vital to humans, intrinsically. And what forces work against that. So, any titles that provide this foundation might help our emerging OP student of personal spaces and privacy. So, g'head and mention some other great books!

<TEXT> Because part of privacy is a threat assessment and striking the right balance.

I've taken my iDevices to Apple for repairs  several times they repaired out-of-warrantee items gratis, which is pretty awesome  and I used to do support, so I have an understanding of what they're doing. It's pretty slick.

But they need to test the entire system, including the boot-related ones (hey, cramped spaces, long queues, too much coffee (man), stuff happens).

Why? Because the end-user doesn't boot off a Flash drive when they take it home. So they need to reproduce how the device is used before releasing it to the customer. That's good service.

Besides, they run the diagnostics on the Genius Bar table, with you watching.

Now, granted, if you're with the State Department (etc.), your threat profile is different. So then you call in a different service besides Apple. *Shrug.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 2016, money politics and power-for-money deals had controlled the presidential election, which was full of lies and farces, its introduction says. There were no guarantees of political rights, while the public responded with waves of boycott and protests, giving full exposure of the hypocritical nature of US democracy

The reports authors decry a widening income gap, deteriorating race relations, the repeated shooting of black Americans by white police and Americas worrisome treatment of children, women and the elderly 

Remember those halcyon days of yore  well, six weeks ago  when we could confidently chuckle at one-party China haranguing us about civil rights, corrupt leaders using the government to enrich their immediate family and treating their internal minorities horribly? Their xenophobic scapegoating? And how their leaders would blurt out the most nonsensical, self-contradicting things?

<TEXT> Also, imagine explaining technical concepts like these to your average jury (assuming you can shell out the tens of thousands of dollars that the expert witnesses earn that your many tens of thousands of dollars private attorney(s) can find).

Versus six-foot high photos of victims or the alleged photos and a hand-waving DA.

**Not** to say that crimes against children aren't reprehensible: they are. But that it's prone to abuse as this case shows. Even without the particulars of this case pushing it even further. 

And even more troubling, today it's Terror! and For The Children!! justifying these tactics, tomorrow it's barbershop licenses and peaceful protests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the article:

R. Scott Moxleys award-winning investigative journalism has touched nerves for two decades. An angry congressman threatened to break Moxleys knee caps. A dirty sheriff promised his critical reporting was irrelevant and then landed in prison. Corporate crooks wont take his calls. Murderous gangsters mad-dogged him in court. The U.S. House of Representatives debated his work. Pusillanimous cops have left hostile messages using fake names. Federal prosecutors credited his stories for the arrest of a doctor who sold fake medicine to dying patients. And a frantic state legislator literally caught sleeping with lobbyists sprinted down state capital hallways to evade his questions in Sacramento. Moxley has won Journalist of the Year honors at the Los Angeles Press Club and been named Distinguished Journalist of the Year by the LA Society of Professional Journalists.

*The OC Weekly* has likewise won numerous awards.

They're both legit, in other words. A lot of really great reporting comes from independent weeklies like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its the latest GOP effort to roll-back Obama-era rules protecting consumers.

The nation's largest broadband companies, including Comcast, AT T and Verizon, hate federal rules approved last year that require them to obtain "opt-in" consent before using, sharing, or selling private consumer data.

For the last several months, the broadband industry has been furiously lobbying the Federal Communications Commission and lawmakers in Congress to kill the privacy policy. As it turns out, two dozen Republican senators are more than willing to oblige and do the bidding of these corporate giants.

Sen. Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican, introduced a resolution on Tuesday that would roll back the FCC's privacy policy, drawing howls of protest from consumer privacy watchdogs. And because Flake is deploying a rarely-used legislative vehicle called the Congressional Review Act, which cannot be filibustered, there is virtually nothing Democrats can do to stop him 

Click thru for more. And if you didn't vote this election, consider voting in the next, in two years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A question concerning implications arising from code names.

If this cache is called Vault 7, does that mean there are Vaults 16? 810? 15?

Since Vault 7 is millions of lines of code   tens of thousands of pages of text, does that imply there are multiples more of these sorts of operations and attacks?

Or, do agencies retire failed off-shoots, keeping the survivor one, so there aren't active programs 16? </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/Ericthor was kind enough to post important clarifications. Pending their reposting (so they can earn all that sweet, *sweet* karma), I'm borrowing it so we can sticky it so it's at the top of page.

If your phone is compromised doesn't matter which app you use. **The issue isn't with apps, but 0-days on iOS and Android.**

I'm out of my depth on this, but looking at the [article here](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/) they link to this page of [iOS exploits going up to 9.2.](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_13205587.html) I'm guessing it be fair to assume that this doc is a little out of date and they have exploits for the most recent iOS and Android OS now.

Then /u/AnonymousAurele was kind enough to follow up with:

Good link. A few others [here](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_13205587.html), [here](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_10453042.html), [here](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_33685523.html), and [here](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_33685523.html).

Note these are all links to Wikileaks.org.

Also note the Vault 7 leak includes hacks for consumer devices (Smart TVs, IoT devices) so it's not *just* mobile phones (at least Android and older iPhones), but many "smart" devices.

If readers want to follow up with other interesting, cited documents (with context), that'd be appreciated.

**Good Coverage So Far:**

Saint Bruce hit the ground running with, [Schneier On Security Blog  WikiLeaks Releases CIA Hacking Tools](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/03/wikileaks_relea.html)

Probably the most brilliant Tweet on the topic, by @Snowden: [In 2014, the government sought to create the world's most dangerous key, claiming it would never be leaked](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/839203485941923840) Followed by FBI Director Comey's WaPo Editorial, *Compromise needed on smartphone encryption: Apple's and Google's approach to encryption is too extreme*. The Snark. IT BURNS!!

Obligatory to emphasize, Snowden didn't release **any** docs to public. Rather, he gave them to reputable journalists since he knew he lacked expertise to properly vet.

<TEXT> I tend towards your view on a very ugly situation. 

The Czars? Jerks terrorizing their people and those standing in the way of their creating an empire like their cousins.

Politburo? Same, though arguably less energetic than a US delivering the Washington Consensus with the twin barrels of the IMF, World Bank, the CIA and the Seventh Fleet. With, I stress, some significant benefits, even if most went to whichever leader the Dulles brothers felt were better stewards of the Seven Sisters or United Fruit Company's progress.

But less Imperialistic. Horrible to be behind the Iron Curtain, but as you point out, Vietnam had worse times under French   American colonial rule than when the USSR was a factor. Less of a regional threat than China.

I'm not a citizen of a state bordering Russia and, while sympathetic to Ukrainians, Russia is less a global Imperialist threat to the world. Horrible regional threat. Personally, a rat bastard who's stolen $40 *Billion* from his perch running Russia. That makes Donald, Ivanka and Jered look like rank amateurs. Get your act together, America!

So, yeah. Complicated, as you say. But for a lot of the world, better than Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany or perhaps the world order dreamed by the Dulles brothers. IMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came here to point out Russia's contributions to world peace.

The current regime is, for sure, problematic. As were their former ones.

But let's give the ~~Russians~~ Soviets, including the Russians (thanks, /u/MemeMeUpFamilia!) credit for the huge sacrifices they endured to free the world from tyranny and Fascism. If you watch too much American film or TV, you'd have the false impression it was almost all the US. It *was* the US (and allies). But quite a bit of it  and certainly the sacrifice side of it  was Russia.

Repulsively ironic that those working with "Uncle Joe" under US Gov't auspices and urging were then later targeted by McCarthy and other Red-Baiting Conservative pols in the United States. Were it not for them, we'd all have quite a bit more goose in our step. </TEXT>

*Edit: misrecollected, sorry. It was [Berkeleyside's coverage of this](http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/03/04/live-tensions-run-high-among-pro-trump-anti-trump-protesters-berkeley/).

<TEXT> In some ways, folks' desire to transcend censorship (even well-meaning, appropriate and parental kinds) is self-policing. That's why I used "teens". 

I think if you raise kids right, explaining *why* you're putting limits, and what for, building up their empathy muscles, by the time they're independent enough to want to explore on their own, they'll also be mature enough to handle the material.

At the same time, we don't want to make the Internet safe for second or third graders, since that would mean curtailing expression and exploration that adults need and deserve.

Another option is see if the YouTube app allows parental controls, and if so, go that route (in addition to /u/SillyBlack's excellent suggestions). </TEXT>

Like /r/Crypto, /r/Privacy transcends political boundaries. This non-profit is UK-based with deep roots in the Continent. As such, if you've ever wondered how crypto development and deployment, IP   digital rights are implemented or any privacy-related issues are handled in a global setting, please ask them. PI has committed to having their staff available during this rolling 3+ day IAMA, so if they can't answer your question immediately, they'll reach out to someone who can!

We are Privacy International  we fight for the right to privacy globally in courts and on the street. Our work includes: reverse engineering smart car parts to understand what data is being collected by car companies, taking governments to court to fight mass surveillance, government hacking of thousands of innocent people's devices. With our partners in the PI Network we research privacy globally, sending FOI requests to various police agencies in the US   UK to find out if they use predictive policing or social media surveillance. And more: AI, machine learning, international landscape of privacy, Snoopers' Charter 

We recently joined forces with the EFF in the USA to question the legality of requiring people to install smart meters. Smart meters can ping usage data back to electricity companies in frequent intervals such as every 15 minutes, which can reveal a lot about a person or family. We think current global legal frameworks are insufficient to properly keep peoples data secure, and we are working to test and strengthen laws and policies.

<TEXT> IoT seems to be implemented Poorly.

There are no controls, little regulation and no incentives to provide secure devices, let alone privacy-respecting ones. Parallels with smart metering exist: lofty goals, poor execution that increases our risk.

IoT botnets taking down many sites through DDOS attacks gets all of the press, but lax security rules seems to ensure that users' privacy will be the next casualty.

1) Are Smart Meters as likely to be vulnerable as IoT, or does part of their mandate include that they be secure? How do we know they're secure? Are they even required to, say, use TLS/HTTPS, let alone more sophisticated protections? 3rd-party audits?

2) Governments don't seem to be taking advantage of these IoT/Smart Meter information leaks. Do you think that it is likely that governments might start using these vulnerabilities?

3) In the US, police served a warrant on Amazon to access their always-on, always-listening Alexa device. Amazon is currently fighting them in US courts on Constitutional grounds. In the UK, and in the EU, how would this play out (both regards warrants, legal defenses and through protections like the EU Charter or with more nebulous UK ones)? </TEXT>

Did you know that they're English? And British? And of the Commonwealth? (Yes, I'm a sodding Yank and some of the finer geographic distinctions confuse me, so I'll aim to hit all the Cricket  rarely Quidditch, *never* baseball  bases)

We try *really* hard to make /r/Privacy a global Sub focusing on working towards global solutions since our threats are global. We are very happy to host Privacy International as part of this effort. We would *very* much appreciate those from outside the US to join in!

We are Privacy International  we fight for the right to privacy globally in courts and on the street. Our work includes: reverse engineering smart car parts to understand what data is being collected by car companies, taking governments to court to fight mass surveillance, government hacking of thousands of innocent people's devices. With our partners in the PI Network we research privacy globally, sending FOI requests to various police agencies in the US   UK to find out if they use predictive policing or social media surveillance. And more: AI, machine learning, international landscape of privacy, Snoopers' Charter 

We recently joined forces with the EFF in the USA to question the legality of requiring people to install smart meters. Smart meters can ping usage data back to electricity companies in frequent intervals such as every 15 minutes, which can reveal a lot about a person or family. We think current global legal frameworks are insufficient to properly keep peoples data secure, and we are working to test and strengthen laws and policies.

Also, the only claim for this is that NSA slide, with no details. And note that Apple is a *very* late entrant to their timeline, versus all the telecom companies, and Microsoft, are pioneers in helping the government in their mass surveillance efforts.

<TEXT> On Thursday, Google's Project Zero disclosed a serious security issue, now known as Cloudbleed, with popular internet infrastructure service Cloudflare. In short, Cloudflare-protected websites and servicesincluding Uber, dating site OkCupid, and Fitbithave inadvertently been leaking sensitive user data, potentially including passwords and private messages.

This isn't the fault of the sites themselves, but the way Cloudflare parsed HTML pages. The leaked data was then archived by search engines, as web pages and data are. Google and Cloudflare have worked to remove much of the exposed data, but some examples may remain.

So what do you actually need to do in light of this?

Why, click thru to read the article, of course!

<TEXT> If your computer has binary blobs (hint: if it's new than a decade, it does) then it is theoretically suspect. Non-free ROMs? Same thing. And simply because something is FLOSS doesn't mean it's safe (witness Heartbleed).

Let alone, it's what you do with your computer that counts more than if you're running MacOS vs a 'Nux. Signing on to your Facebook account? On a browser w/o any privacy plug-ins? Visiting other sites and using the FB plug-in to share it? Your privacy is hosed.

That said, you can dual boot. Probably /r/Apple could help with the particulars. 

Keep in mind that, unlike Windows, MacOS is Linux based, proper with permissions. And it's not built around monetizing your every online move, as any Google offering or Windows 10 is. [Apple does care about your privacy,](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) and more importantly, their business model ensures that you and their interests are aligned. They've also shown (during the Apple vs FBI fiasco that came out in their favor) that they'll go to the mat to protect their users' privacy.

Unlike Microsoft and Windows (let alone Facebook), where *at best*, you might with a LOT of work, fight the strong anti-privacy currents that these other companies' businesses are founded upon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Burn in Hell, spyware vendors:

An NPR investigation in 2014 found that 75 percent of 70 surveyed domestic violence shelters encountered victims whose abusers had eavesdropped on conversations using hidden apps. 

And,

Consumer spyware is not marketed to governments. Instead, many of the companies explicitly gear products toward jealous loversespecially menwho want to monitor their spouses.

"Many spouses cheat. They all use cell phones. Their cell phone will tell you what they won't," reads the website of FlexiSpy, another company selling spyware.

Cindy Southworth, executive vice president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, pointed to several examples, including one from a website called HelloSpy.

"It showed a woman thrown off a bed as part of their advertising for their spouse-tracking," Southworth told Motherboard in a phone call. Another image on the HelloSpy website, online at the time of writing, includes a woman, with her face cut and bruised.

"It's repulsive, it's misogynistic, it's gross," Southworth added  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh boy, this just gets better and better:

In the demo, Palantir identified Wikipedia users who belonged to a fictional radical religious sect and graph their social relationships The unmentioned and obvious subtext of the experiment was the fact that such techniques could be applied to de-anonymize and track members of any political or ideological group. 

Won't *someone* rid us the the scourge of out-of-control and *evil* Wikipedia editors?! How about if we throw $1.2 Billion taxpayer dollars at it. Now, will someone?

Among a litany of other conclusions, Palantir determined the group was prone to violence because its Manifestos intellectual influences include Pancho Villa, Che Guevara, Leon Trotsky, [and] Cuban revolutionary Jose Mart, a list of military commanders and revolutionaries with a history of violent actions.

Yeah, that, or they finally nabbed that nefarious cabal of college juniors working on their mid-term paper for Latin American Studies.

<TEXT> Palantir has never masked its ambitions, in particular the desire to sell its services to the U.S. government  the CIA itself was an early investor in the startup through In-Q-Tel, the agencys venture capital branch. But Palantir refuses to discuss or even name its government clientele, despite landing at least $1.2 billion in federal contracts since 2009, according to an August 2016 report in Politico. The company was last valued at $20 billion and is expected to pursue an IPO in the near future. In a 2012 interview with TechCrunch, while boasting of ties to the intelligence community, Karp said nondisclosure contracts prevent him from speaking about Palantirs government work.

I have the suspicion that Thiel and his team decided, 

"We'd **love** to get billions of those sweet, no-bid, Black Budget tax dollars. No accountability and dense idiots who still have AOL email accounts in charge of signing those checks."

"So how can we spin enough technobabble and hire enough lobbyists to make it happen?" </TEXT>

 Police have identified the man who triggered a tense standoff with police after firing a high-powered rifle at officers and residents near Bishop ODowd High School Friday morning as Oakland resident Jesse *Enjaian* (thx, /u/fooz_the_face!)

He is a 2008 alum of UCLA and a 2013 alum of University of Michigan Law School.

Enjaian is the co-founder and computer engineer at the computer company Oakland Microsystems.

Police sources confirmed to KPIX 5 that officers had responded to Enjaians house earlier this week regarding either threats or a report of a gun.

Oakland Microsystems doesn't exist so far as DDG or Google are concerned.

<TEXT> OK, less LOLs-tastic. 

From the CBS story linked below:

The gunman was clearly seen in helicopter video shooting out a window of a home on Las Vegas Avenue located near the high school which was on lock down.

The gunman then exited the home, spray painted eyes on a neighbors garage and also spray painted a white car on the street.

He then walked into the backyard, fired shots toward a fence and then the helicopter.

The man had been shooting at residents and parked cars and fired on Oakland police officers as they arrived.

No injuries were reported but officers are still canvassing the neighborhood.

The high school across the street was locked down, as were neighboring businesses. It looks like the home he vandalized was ~~his own~~ a neighbors (worst neighbor ever!)

But given he painted a pair of eyes on it, it looks like he didn't take full advantage of the larger canvas and extra composing time that he had. Amateur. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, talk about things I never expected I'd be typing.

Breitbart isn't normally a site we prefer when others exist. The level of journalism they have simply isn't up to par. But in this case, with this article, they **do** have an exclusive with William Binney. He's kind of A Big Deal.

Maybe Binney is hinting if we want to increase privacy and prune the Deep State, we need to a) look at all media sources and independently verify them, and b) build coalitions. 

Anyway, I'd hate to have gods knows what is on their ad serving side of things, so I'll post most of it here. 

Appreciate the reports, and we *get* it. This is a special case.

William Binney, a former highly placed NSA official turned whistleblower, contended in an exclusive interview today that the National Security Agency (NSA) is absolutely monitoring the phone calls of President Donald Trump.


Binney was an architect of the NSAs surveillance program. He became a famed whistleblower when he resigned on October 31, 2001 after spending more than 30 years with the agency.

Asked whether he believes the NSA is tapping Trump, Binney replied: Absolutely. How did they get the phone call between the president and the president of Australia? Or the one that he made with Mexico? Those are not targeted foreigners.

Binney further [contended](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html) the NSA may have been behind a data leak that might have revealed that Michael Flynn, Trumps national security adviser, allegedly misled Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump administration officials about the contents of his phone calls with Russias ambassador to Washington.

Regarding Flynns case, Binney stated of the NSA:

If they werent behind it, they certainly had the data. Now the difference here is that FBI and CIA have direct access inside the NSA databases. So, they may be able to go directly in there and see that material there. And NSA doesnt monitor that. They dont even monitor their own people going into databases.

So, they dont monitor what CIA and FBI do. And theres no oversight or attempted oversight by any of the committees or even the FISA court. So, any way you look at it, ultimately the NSA is responsible because they are doing the collection on everybody inside the United States. Phone calls. Emails. All of that stuff.

He was speaking on the podcast edition of this reporters talk radio program, Aaron Klein Investigative Radio, broadcast on New Yorks AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphias NewsTalk 990 AM.

During the interview, Binney referred to a 2008 report referencing two NSA whistleblowers who said they worked at the agencys station in Fort Gordon, Georgia and were asked to not only monitor phone calls of U.S. citizens but transcribe them.

Utilizing data provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden, the Guardian and Washington Post in June 2013 released a series of articles reporting that the NSA was collecting the telephone records of millions of Americans.

Prior to those reports, National Intelligence Director James Clapper claimed on March 12, 2013 during an open session of the Senate Intelligence Committee that the NSA was not wittingly collecting data on Americans.

Not wittingly, Clapper said when asked whether the NSA was spying on U.S. citizens. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.

During the interview, Binney charged that the NSA was over-funded and out of control.

He offered recommendations for how he says Trump can reign in the agency:

He can order that they put a filter on the front end of all their collection that eliminates any U.S. citizens anywhere in the world unless they have a warrant for it. If they dont, then he has to put people in jail if they violated.

So, I mean, thats the way to do it. The other way is to cut their budget. I mean they are given too much money anyway. When they are given too much money, they get to do wild and crazy things. And this is wild and crazy. Violations of the Constitutions 4th, 5th, and 6th amendments.

On Wednesday, Trump singled out the NSA and FBI in a series of tweets about Flynns case as well as reports in the New York Times and Washington Post claiming further contacts between Trump advisors and Russia.

The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American!

Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View  "The NSA   FBIshould not interfere in our politicsand is" Very serious situation for USA

Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes   @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia

 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017

The Times on Tuesday seemed to be quoting from intercepted phone calls to report on alleged contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russian intelligence agents.

The Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html):

Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials.

American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a paragraph in Greenwald's article addressing this:

The motives of leakers are irrelevant. Its very possible  indeed, likely  that the leakers here were not acting with benevolent motives. Nobody with a straight face can claim that lying to the public is regarded in official Washington as some sort of mortal sin; if anything, the contrary is true: Its seen as a job requirement.

It's also the difference in someone leaking to journalists, who then apply their training, versus a data-dump like Wikileaks did. Having someone else base a story on it helps insulate whatever biases the leaker has (which, I agree, in this case are suspect). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The mere fact that an act is illegal does not mean it is unjust or even deserving of punishment. Oftentimes, the most just acts are precisely the ones that the law prohibits.

Thats particularly true of whistleblowers  i.e., those who reveal information the law makes it a crime to reveal, when doing so is the only way to demonstrate to the public that powerful officials are acting wrongfully or deceitfully. In those cases, we should cheer those who do it even though they are undertaking exactly those actions that the criminal law prohibits.

This Flynn episode underscores another critical point: The motives of leakers are irrelevant. Its very possible  indeed, likely  that the leakers here were not acting with benevolent motives. Nobody with a straight face can claim that lying to the public is regarded in official Washington as some sort of mortal sin; if anything, the contrary is true: Its seen as a job requirement.

More importantly, it's a good thing that there's this switch. If half the folks whose partisan fears were ignited by Obama join half that are now ignited by Trump, then those, plus those who were concerned with *any* administration having these vast powers, then that's a positive trend.

So, rather than cramming this news into yet another partisan filter, how about focusing on shared concerns over policy? </TEXT>

Then if OP gets a UK VPN, their government would *also* be able to get those records, correct? Thus the only viable VPN use would be for a VPN that is outside the UK, or Five Eyes generally?

<TEXT> Or, if there's not a book, maybe we can extrapolate amongst ourselves what a Pinoy, say, might be concerned for with regards surveillance. That is, much focus is on Northern countries, Five Eye nations, or Russian or Chinese citizens. 

Assume you're a citizen of a Southern country. How much of a threat do you face and what kinds of things can you do to mitigate them?

1) You don't have to fear a Five Eye nation spying on you. But only because you know they already do. But the GCHQ probably won't be informing your leader (Duerte in this case) that you're interested in pro-Democracy efforts. I'd think if you follow the same techniques we're familiar with, you're pretty safe.

2) While you have to worry about your government's surveillance, they don't have the budgets or expertise to be the same kind of threat as the NSA. They *might* outsource to some of the commercial entities, but this isn't mass surveillance and if you use secure digital OpSec, you're too expensive for them to try breaking into your activities and comms, assuming they can.

So, along these sorts of lines, what are the advantages/disadvantages of being a citizen of a Southern (Lesser-Developed) nation that's not a Five Eyes nation?

Assuming your nation isn't strategically important to a Five Eyes (or Chinese or Russian) nation, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey. </TEXT>

So I was writing to /u/oh hell the HELL no way I'm typing that out, but let's say, OP on his original post. I didn't approve it since it seemed confusing. I'll post what I wrote him explaining why, so everyone has an idea of what he's looking for, for this post which we approved.

What are some great privacy/anonymity related books that aren't written from a US perspective? Maybe more Euro-centric? British? Even better, from a Developing Nation one? It's a global fight, so let's hear from non-US perspectives! Thanks!

So, if you're looking for anonymity related books, but from a Euro/non-US perspective, include that in the title.

Something like,

Any suggestions on good privacy/anonymity related books, only written from non-US perspective. Europe? UK? Developing nations? Thanks!

Advisory only. My only qualm is if you dislike those two books, don't put them in the title. Why give them free hype? But mentioning as a comment you aren't looking for those two, and why, would be great. Make sense?

Probably TMI, but we'd probably cut slack if it was a universally liked book. "I like *No Place to Hide* and am looking for other great books. Suggestions?" would probably be okay.

Yeah, I admit it's fuzzy like Hell. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very cool. Thanks!

Well, the idea of threat modeling (of which your threat profile is a part) is that being secure costs. Time, money, focus, learning And to be super-secure all the time against the best adversaries is exhausting. Which results in mistakes. So instead, figure out what you're doing, when, and who might want to know about it behind your back. What's the cost if you lose? What's the effort? Where's the sensible balance?

Ex: your horrible kid sister breaking into your diary w/ a hairpin is different than your boss finding out you attended the Woman's March protest last month, which is different than your reporting on fraud, waste   abuse at the NSA in one of their billion-dollar programs that they'd just as soon not have everyone know about. Or your girl (boy) friend's hostile parent/cop might be interested in knowing you buy weed but have an expired Rx.

All sorts of harmless  even heroic  things that face different threats, with different outcomes. If you're worried about your kid sister but you're countering it as though she were the NSA, that's wasted effort that will make it likely you'll screw up or decide, Screw It. Then get busted by your boy (girl) friend's crappy parent abusing his power to break you guys up.

So, you want to balance out the threats and outcomes from the work involved, and compartmentalize. Do social things you don't care about without much worries, pay your credit card bill with more concern, attend a legal protest (sigh: yes [it's come to this, at least in the US](http://mashable.com/2017/02/06/dc-police-subpoena-facebook-inauguration-protests/)) with more care, and communicate with someone (who knows someone who knows someone) who's a whistleblower with even more.

(Shout-out in reference to the above *It's Come To This* link: Don't Use Facebook To Organize *Anything*. Even better, don't use Facebook)

* The [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org) has more in their [Surveillance Self Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/ssd) kit. They also cover what to do for your mobile, when protesting, if reporting and other situations. They're pretty cool.

* *The Intercept* is a great site and have an [If You See Something, Leak Something](https://theintercept.com/leak/) campaign with further tips, especially journalism-related.

* I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Reddit resources like /r/Privacy and /r/PrivacyToolsIO.
______

So. Back to the question.

Before, there was you, there was the threat. And there was Apple on your side. Then the US government tried through a sneaky, sleazy and almost secret process to **force** Apple to create a version of their iOS that would betray its users. This custom GovtOS  would make it trivial to break any iPhone. Apple said, "You *crazy!*" the FBI said, "Screw you, DO IT," and [The Apple vs FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBIApple_encryption_dispute) case happened. People  a **lot** of people  freaked out, Apple stood tall fighting for us, the FBI caved (after lying about 20 times (yay, FBI!) in their formal legal statements). Apple wasn't forced to create GovtOS and we were all saved. For now.

But the *idea* that governments would **force** Apple to betray their users made Cook and Apple decide, "Geez, we always assumed we'd be free to protect our users' privacy. But what happens if/when governments pull this crap again?"

Thus going forward (and already for many, many things), Apple's privacy protocols ensure that Apple is *also* a zero-knowledge party. iMessage? End-to-End encrypted that (so long as you don't back up to iCloud) not even Apple can read. Your newer iPhone and all Macs? Encrypted, usually by default, that Apple can't read. [Etc.](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) 

iCloud is the big remaining item, and some folks would like to see some more transparency with Messages, so that might be tweaked.

These last steps are what happens when Apple includes itself as part of the threat model. That is, in addition to your kid sister, your significant other's crazy, abusive dad, your boss or E. European hackers, Apple includes *itself* as a party that might (hypothetically!) be forced to betray you.

TL;DR: the fact that a company like Apple has to worry about (hypothetically!) being forced to betray its users, after decades of fighting for us, has to piss Tim Cook (and Apple) off. It'd be great to get his reaction to that.

Does that help? Enjoy the lecture  I'm envious!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And, it's not only Vizio:

The allegations are only the latest to raise troubling privacy concerns about Internet-connected TVs and other so-called Internet-of-things devices. In late 2015, security researchers found that Vizio TVs failed to properly validate the HTTPS certificates of servers they connected to when transmitting viewing-habit data. That made it trivial for anyone who had the ability to monitor and control the Internet traffic passing between the TV and the Vizio servers to impersonate the servers and view or tamper with the transmitted data. Smart TVs manufactured by LG have also been caught collecting potentially sensitive data, including a list of shows being watched, the names of files contained on connected USB drives, and the names of files shared on home or office networks.

<TEXT> Yeah, I'm usually one to err on the side of plaintiffs in cases like these, but it seems unreasonable to hold a district responsible for a parent of a student going to an alternative school. Teachers weren't involved. It was held off school property and the school had no role promoting the parties. 

The article seemed confusing on this point: were these school events, or were these events that students of the school attended? 

Even for what could be viewed as someone trying too hard to be a Cool Dad, neither he, or his kid, were aware of these rapes (not 100% sure since the article is confusing on this), were notified of them or participated in them.

Suing the father I could see. You hold several parties where bad things happen (damage, underage drinking, etc, let alone sexual assaults), you have some culpability. But a district, of an alt-school, of one student, with a sloppy parent?

Keep in mind, monies the district pays out in attorneys, settlements and judgements is money that's not spent on schools, learning, teachers and kids. </TEXT>

b) It provides clicks  and thus revenue  for a 3rd party that did no work (or spent costs) to write the story. Reporters gotta eat and without the original source getting paid, fake news will rise triumphant.

c) It provides analytic data for a 3rd party that does a *lot* of work (really brilliant work) to track down anyone on the net, tying together the various things we all do on the web, ties it up in a pretty bow then sells it to other parties. Really, Google, Facebook and the like already do this well enough on their own. Do we *really* need to help them more?

Yeah. About that:

In January, EPIC obtained two years of monthly statistics for the NGI system under the Freedom of Information Act. The summary sheets show that the databases expansion has been fueled by submissions of non-criminal identifiers, such as the prints submitted for background checks. Fact sheets from January 2015 through August 2016 show the database growing at a much higher rate from its collection of data from civil settings than from criminal justice purposes. During that period, **civil submission rates constituted nearly 70 percent of new submissions. Through the Rap Back program the FBI is collecting biographical and biometric data on potentially millions of civilians for purposes not associated with criminal justice,** Scott said. </TEXT>

The major take-away is that there are significant amounts of money unaccounted for that the Glencore/Qutar explanation can't explain. It's *not* a routine, if overly-lawyered, corporate finance deal.

That's all I'm saying. If it was on its own, I'd agree, Tin-Foil. Sure. But as the OP's post shows, there are *way* too many of these "coincidences", further compounded by Trump's actions before and after the election.

These situations are tough: it's not as though Russian oligarchs or other corrupt Authoritarians are stupid enough to walk into each others' offices carrying big gunny sacks with "$" printed on them.

Especially for such a large transaction of a company that operates globally, and thus needs *some* pretense of transparency of ownership to avoid most other nations and companies being hesitant to invest or trade with them Unless, of course, there were illegal but compelling reasons to forge ahead, anyway.

I'll bring /u/Aethien's [excellent summary here](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5roev7/donald_trump_lifts_sanctions_on_russia_that_were/dd96pel/) since it's perfect and reputably sourced (Reuters).

[Glencore contributed only 300 million euros of equity to the deal, less than 3 percent of the purchase price, which it said in a statement on Dec. 10 had bought it an "indirect equity interest" limited to just 0.54 percent of Rosneft.](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1582OH)

Qatar paid for 2.5 billion, QHG (unknown owners through various shell companies including one at the Cayman Isles) paid 5.2 billion which it borrowed from an Italian bank which leaves a 2.2 billion dollar gap.

This quote from the article is also interesting: 

"But public records in Singapore show that Russia's second-largest bank, state-controlled VTB, loaned the Singapore vehicle QHG Shares the full 10.2 billion euros that it paid to the Russian state last month to buy the stake." </TEXT>

Pres. Trump doesnt have a license to blackmail universities. Hes the president, not a dictator, and his empty threats are an abuse of power.

**Congresswoman Lee's Statement on Berkeley Protests**

Milo Yiannopoulos has made a career of inflaming racist, sexist and nativist sentiments. Berkeley has a proud history of dissent and students were fully within their rights to protest peacefully. However, I am disappointed by the unacceptable acts of violence last night which were counterproductive and dangerous.

President Trump cannot bully our university into silence. Simply put, President Trump's empty threat to cut funding from UC Berkeley is an abuse of power. As a senior member of the education funding subcommittee, I will continue to stand up to President Trump's overreach and defend the rights of our students and faculty.

<TEXT> You see many people confused on this, so it's worth noting again.

It doesnt matter, by the way, whether the Muslims in question are citizens or noncitizens, green card holders, visa holders or refugees. The Equal Protection Clause explicitly prohibits deny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws This means that all foreign travelers on U.S. soilthose waiting at U.S. airports, for exampleare protected.

The Constitution and Bill of Rights places limits on *government* powers, versus protecting citizens directly. Likewise, any powers not specifically, limitedly granted in these documents, the government does not have.

That's why, for instance, we can have a Constitutional right to privacy, even though there isn't a specific amendment for it.

But, no free lunch: they gave us our republic, now it's our job to keep it. </TEXT>

Constitutional rights lawyers Faiza Patel and Vince Warren dissect the (il)legality of Trumps immigration ban and Rep. Barbara Lee breaks down Trumps terrifying approach to government. Former covert agent Mike German and Intercept Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed explain what secret FBI documents published this week by The Intercept tell us about how Trump could resurrect J.

<TEXT> An interesting Op/Ed thought piece. 

The administration is testing the extent to which the DHS (and other executive agencies) can act and ignore orders from the other branches of government. This is as serious as it can possibly get: all of the arguments about whether order X or Y is unconstitutional mean nothing if elements of the government are executing them and the courts are being ignored.

Yesterday was the trial balloon for a coup dtat against the United States. It gave them useful information.

It builds on what the author, Yonatan Zunger, wrote the day before, [What Things Going Wrong Can Look Like](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/what-things-going-wrong-can-look-like-400f84a0cc3a#.hydz0nzbq) </TEXT>

Spoiler: there were. Many.

But reports from Yemen quickly surfaced that 30 people were killed, including 10 women and children. Among the dead: the 8-year-old granddaughter of Nasser al-Awlaki, Nawar, who was also the daughter of Anwar Awlaki.

The girl was was shot in the neck and killed, bleeding to death over the course of two hours. Why kill children?, the grandfather asked. This is the new (U.S.) administration  its very sad, a big crime.

<TEXT> To show all you budding (real-world) privacy activists what's possible, and why focusing on local municipalities first works better than trying to take on the entire Federal government (at first), the CA cities of San Francisco, Oakland and Richmond all pushed back. 

A fusion center was significantly cut back, contracts cancelled, scopes limited, data retention windows accepted, etc. And Richmond and Oakland have active, feisty Privacy Boards overseeing what happens in their cities. 

All police aren't bad, the same as all police aren't all good. A balance needs to be struck, which only happens with citizen involvement.

Here are a couple of stories by another great reporter, Darwin BondGraham, of the excellent *East Bay Express,* on this:

<TEXT> Do we have any idea of how much money is involved? To which companies? Are they politically well-connected?

And what are the start-up costs versus maintenance ones? Is DHS or other Federal money involved?

Deep Throat's dictum, Follow The Money, is handy with stories like these.

We defeated one of these efforts a couple years ago. The Feds wanted to create a "Fusion Center" tying together all the public surveillance cameras with private companies' license plate readers and data-mining. Supposedly, as always, because TERROR!

Leaked internal memos revealed planners never mentioned terrorism, or even crime. Just "protesters" and "labor strikers". Dystopian, much? 

We beat it down and they retreated.

A funny thing is, the Fed grants were hyped as making it "free" to our city. However the labor of city police and the like, as well as annual subscriptions and related costs were more than one million dollars per year. So, they're very sneaky about supplying the syringe, the spoon, lighter and tourniquet. And that *delicious* one free taste.

Then once a municipality is hooked is when the lobbyists move in and start gorging at our trough. </TEXT>

This is a highly advanced system theyre asking for, said Clare Garvie, an associate at Georgetown Universitys Center for Privacy and Technology, and who specializes in police use of face recognition technologies. This is going to be terabytes  if not petabytes  of data, and multiple cameras running 24 hours a day. In order to be face recognition compliant they probably have to be pretty high definition.

<TEXT> Again, sorry.

But elections have consequences. Even if that means puppies, kittens and a minority of people voted a different way, or didn't vote at all, are affected by their decisions or apathy.

What's your alternative? No one is *ever* held accountable for their political actions? That's *crazy*.

I don't take any pleasure in, say, what will happen to our health care system after the GOP pulls their Remove   Replace (With Nothing). Let alone our never having a state option for Single Payer back when ACA was being ironed out. And the Red States are going to be **so** screwed by the GOP on this, worse than us. That sucks!

But what's the alternative? These states asking the Blue States, the major population centers, to pay for their screw-ups? ~~That doesn't seem fair.~~ Oh, wait, that's what they already do. 

Well, no more. Let every person lie in the bed they make. If you don't like your bed, make a new one. Or move to a different bed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One can walk and chew gum at the same time.

The simple fact is, big picture things like CalPERS **should** represent its CA employees, who overwhelmingly favor measures to mitigate Global Warming.

And, local reps  like Kaplan and others  doing non-time-intensive things like this get press, which increases awareness, which creates pressure on CalPERS.

"The people, and public workers, of California, should not in any way finance, support, or allow our money to be used for the destructive Dakota Access Pipeline," Kapland said in a statement today. "The pipeline proposal not only threatens the health of the planet and the safety of the drinking water, it also represents a horrifying example of environmental racism."

Since we are capable of masticating while ambulating, a more germane question to ask is, What the Hell is CalPERS thinking to begin with, supporting the fossil fuel industry, harmful projects and Donald Trump's agenda?

The City of Oakland's employees are members of the CalPERS pension system, and the city pays millions a year into their pensions. Billions of CalPERS funds are invested in oil and gas companies, but the pension system was ordered in 2015 by state lawmakers to divest from thermal coal due to its role in increasing global CO2 emissions.

CalPERS, the state's giant public-employee retirement system, has invested $57 million in Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline. The retirement system also owns Sunoco bonds worth $1.8 million. Sunoco and ETP recently merged. The pension also owns approximately $242 million of ConocoPhillips stock, a major oil company that is directly backing construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. </TEXT>

<TEXT> THE CLOCK STRUCK 13 on January 20, Donald Trump is the president of the United States, and episode one of Intercepted is here. Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald and Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed join Jeremy Scahill for a discussion on the crazy apocalyptic present in which we find ourselves. 

They break down Trumps attacks on the media, that insane speech he gave at the CIA, and the state of the Democratic Party. Naomi Klein sends in a dispatch from the Womens March against the Trump-Pence administration about whats at stake for people who are not men. Jeremy goes deep into the secretive world of Seymour Hershs kitchen and shoots the shit with the legendary, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist about why he calls Trump a circuit breaker for the two-party system. And we hear a spoken-word performance from hip-hop artist Immortal Technique.

<TEXT> [Relevant Reddit Front Page Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/5q4m80/uanzai_explains_in_detail_why_the_alternative/).

And from /u/Piemonkey's [*excellent* observation](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/5q4m80/uanzai_explains_in_detail_why_the_alternative/dcwew00/):

It's a common tactic that goes like this:  
Them: *statement*  
You: Argument against *statement*  
Them: Evidence!  
You: Okay, here it is.  
Them: lol all lies  
And then they basically ask you for more evidence without providing any of their own at all, in the hopes that eventually you'll give up or make a mistake so they can jump all over you, without ever once responding to the initial disagreement of their statement.  

We've veered far enough from privacy related issues for me to continue. Back to the original topic: *1984* is the #1 bestselling book on Amazon as I type this. Have a great day! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funny, since even the WH spokesperson said, expect a month or more.

Do you have any cites from reputable sources of the Obama administration muzzling our government agencies for a month-plus like the current one has. If you claim it, let's see them.

It's instructive *which* departments have had a gag rule imposed on them: basically any concerning public safety, health or globally-impacting science. It's no accident.

If you bother to click thru to the article, you'll see why this administrative response against departments that, after all, we **all** pay for, is worrying:

A wholesale clampdown on public information would pose risks, said Steve Lenkart, the executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees.

"I would advise this new administration to tread lightly when ordering any increase of secrecy of government operations or policies," he said. "The American people expect an open, transparent and honest government"

Those concerns were compounded on Inauguration Day, when the Interior Department ordered a shutdown of all its Twitter accounts after the National Park Service retweeted photos showing a substantially smaller crowd at Trumps swearing-in than had greeted Obama in 2009. Interiors Twitter service was restored the next day, but only after the park service deleted the offending tweets and apologized.

The environment *used* to be a bi-partisan interest, and currently has *amazingly* solid support across the entire electorate. Against the *one* report that the Bush Administration published, there are multiple, entrenched threats the EPA has changed for the better over the past decades: [Acid Rain, DDT, leaded gasoline and air pollution](http://grist.org/article/here-are-4-big-pollution-problems-epa-has-mostly-fixed-already/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The **Bush Era** EPA? **A** report?

Okay. One rushed and erroneous report, probably/possibly pushed for political motives or possibly a bureaucratic screw-up. **A** report.

Versus [silencing *every* department](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/federal-agencies-trump-information-lockdown-234122), the Oval Office *directly* ordering the EPA to not talk to anyone outside their department but instead refer them to Trump's hand-picked spokesperson, especially if they work for *our* media.

Federal agencies are clamping down on public information and social media in the early days of Donald Trump's presidency, limiting employees ability to issue news releases, tweet, make policy pronouncements or otherwise communicate with the outside world, according to memos and sources from multiple agencies.

The steps to mute federal employees  seen to varying degrees in the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of the Interior, Transportation, Agriculture and Health and Human Services  are sparking early fears of a broader crackdown across the government, as Trump vows to pursue an agenda sharply at odds with his predecessor.

Your false analogy is very false. And uhh, at worst, shows Republicans are hostile to the notion that the American people are entitled to clean air, water and land. Or even deserve to know the truth about what they breathe, drink and eat.

Bonus Question: Which party blocked funds to 9/11 First Responders for *years* until many people, including Jon Stewart, pushed many times, including on-air, to have our Congress do the right thing? Is that better, or worse, than a single report done once during the Bush Administration?  </TEXT>

Flash is horribly insecure with "must-fix" zero-day bugs that crop up almost every other day. This is another vulnerability, since its another thing that must be updated (and not everyone does this). Plus it's closed source, so gods know what else it's doing. And, most of the toxic ad-based malware relies on Flash. Finally, it's awful on battery use.

Besides that, Flash is *great!* ;)

<TEXT> Yay! All hail /u/Erktheerk! And his modesty and sharing credit!

And for new lurkers, this is something /r/Privacy veterans are more prone to do: I left out specifically who was involved doing a specific task, letting them come forward if they liked. Giving them control over what of themselves they'd like others to know.

See, it's not that we don't share, or aren't open. But rather, we think folks should be the ones to choose how much to disclose.

30K posts is a lot, and a lot of work. A question I'd have is, would the utility be worth it? Would a Sub with open, general posting be likely to have the vast majority of posts correctly flaired? It seems to be that high percentages would be needed for filters to reliably work  is say 85% or higher realistic?

Are there better uses of our precious time? 

I'm not suggesting answers, but posing questions we'd want to consider. :)

_____

Edit: another thing to consider, is Bots can be kinda dumb. Or we're inconsistent hairless monkeys that are too random for our machine overlords to categorize. "Lavabit Announces Return With New Open Source Service". Is it Crypto? Email? Internet? Business? Surveillance? Political? It's kind of, all of the above. And many titles stymie keywords, so Bots will cry.

We are able to make a decent go of things at /r/NSALeaks, but that's with 6-odd submitters, all motivated to make our Flair system work since we know many of our subscribers like screening for categories. And, if more than 10-ish percent of the stories aren't tagged, then these stories won't show up.

It's stuff like this that all the Mods of all Subs wrestle over  there are often no right answers, just better ones for each Sub. :) </TEXT>

The thing about that is, even with Bots, it'll be your humble Moderators who are manually doing this. That's a **huge** chore, and ask.

We like the idea, believe me. But the logistics get painful.

For instance, I also moderate a curated Sub, /r/NSALeaks. So, no one but Mods can post. Great quality control of the articles. But even us? Forget to apply Flairs more than we should. And we have *really* crackjack Mods who are Bot/Script wizards.

We have three Mods here (which we like: folksy!) Volunteering their time. So, we know they'd be great. *We* think they'd be great. But it'll be a lower priority than other things we do. :) </TEXT>

* using proper passwords to secure your accounts

* using siloing

* creating multiple email accounts for different purposes (or getting rid of any using your actual name), or 

* *finally* getting around to encrypting your devices

The F.B.I. is also examining the allegations in that dossier, and a summary of its contents was provided to Mr. Trump earlier this month.

Representatives of the agencies involved declined to comment. **Of the half-dozen current and former officials who confirmed the existence of the investigations, some said they were providing information because they feared the new administration would obstruct their efforts.** All spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the cases.

<TEXT> American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American officials said.

The continuing counterintelligence investigation means that Mr. Trump will take the oath of office on Friday with his associates under investigation and after the intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government had worked to help elect him. As president, Mr. Trump will oversee those agencies and have the authority to redirect or stop at least some of these efforts.

You know, in a different situation, the irony of the current director of J. Edgar Hoovers FBI helping deliver the White House to partial Kremlin control would be delicious.

<TEXT> I sometimes get the sense that /r/Apple attracts a lot of people who are Android trolls (for iOS-related posts) and Windows trolls (for MacOS posts). Sometimes, but more rarely, Hackintosh trolls.

I've seen these *looooong* chains form where folks extoll, in lavish detail, the "amazing" benefits of Android or Windows. 

*Always* prefaced with, "As a long-time Mac (iPhone) user, I've recently come to the conclusion that"

Then of course if I point out I come to /r/Apple to read about, well, Apple products, the usual "Apple fanboy" responses fly (with down votes, which I never care about).

I suppose we should be honored that folks using other platforms waste their time and effort here, but it's boring. And distracting. And sometimes results in flames which *Yawn*.

So, if pruning any conversations that seem more an excuse to hype Android or Windows  when perfectly good Subs exist for this  is something Mods are considering, I'd be okay with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Republican state Rep. Keith Kempenich, has said that some "accidents" might occur if motorists punched the accelerator rather than the brakes, according to the Bismarck Tribune.

Oops! Case dismissed!

This trend of anti-protest legislation dressed up as obstruction bills is deeply troubling, said Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, who views such bills as violations of the First Amendment. A law that would allow the state to charge a protester $10,000 for stepping in the wrong place, or encourage a driver to get away with manslaughter because the victim was protesting, is about one thing: chilling protest. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's the proper work flow for editing a picture in Photos, across multiple devices </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-19 20:43:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I love Photos. I have a Mac and a iPad. I use the latter to take photos but also import photos from my camera to my desktop. I use my Mac to back up and syndicate changes, not iCloud. Although, I have shared galleries I use iCloud for, but not for auto backup.

A couple versions ago, I'd edit a photo and the changes would take place across all my devices. Now, it's more complicated and I find when I edit a photo, it doesn't necessarily propagate. I'm stuck with an old photo and the newly edited one, either in one of my devices or in one of the dizzying number of groups that Photos creates: 

* Photos

* All Photos

* My Photo Stream

* Any of the local iPhoto Events galleries

* Any shared iCloud gallery I've created

* Plus the newer algorithm ones like Faces, Selfies, Moments, etc.

* *Argh.*

So, if I want to make a single edit to a single photo then have these changes take effect across all these groups, across all my devices, which one do I edit? The one in Photos? All Photos? Which?

Bonus Q: I've noticed sometimes when I add a photo to a gallery, it is no longer in one of the groups. *Why?* I simply want to *add* a photo to a gallery, not *replace* it.

PS: If this post belongs in /r/Apple, let me know. I'll cheerfully move it. Or if someone has already written up a decent guide on fathoming this, feel free to refer me to it. :)

PS: Besides this quirk, I *like* Photos (I also like Photoshop  different tools for different uses). So let's not make this a *DAE Hate The Photos App?* thread. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The highlighted part is new. Or, new to me:

Facebook does not deny that there is a vulnerability that can be used to wiretap targeted conversations by, for example, governments with access to WhatsApps servers. And **despite WhatsApps recent public statements, the vulnerability cannot be avoided by verifying fingerprints or checking a checkbox in the WhatsApp settings.**

Am I off? I recall Facebook, WhatsApp and even Moxie saying, No worries, its a design/preference choice, easily corrected if youre privacy-conscious.

Yet, Tobias Boelter writes,

Using WhatsApp [after you've replaced your lost/damaged phone], your friends phones are instructed to automatically re-encrypt and retransmit any messages that havent been delivered. But they dont know if they are sending messages to you or the government. Then, and only if your friends specifically asked WhatsApp to do so, they will see a warning after delivering the messages that there couldve been something shady going on. 

Signal on the other hand will tell your friends something like: There mightve been something shady going on. Do you want to resend your message?

But how often do those situations [losing/replacing a phone] really occur? Id say not that often. </TEXT>

Thanks **so** much. Really honored and grateful.

I'm a Mod there.

A link to [our ad is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/51yomr/rprivacy_ad_v3_3rd_is_the_charm/)

I can't think of any longer term issue affecting Redditors than the issue of privacy, required to develop as people, as we share our evolving, uncensored thoughts with peers. Except for cats, but I don't mod /r/kittehpictures.

We're a busy Sub but we're very rigorous in keeping the tone and quality high, with no personal horribleness, promotion or flames. We put special care in ensuring newbies are welcome and encouraged to ask all the "stupid" questions we asked when we were in their position. And we're very glad to see neophytes become more aware of how to empower themselves and others as they learn more about being private while engaging in our digital (and physical!) worlds. We're also fortunate to have many experts and some journalists covering the digital security beat who contribute. We *really* work hard to be a home for both kinds of people.

We humbly think Reddit will become a better place as more people become aware of how to protect themselves and those they care for living in our digital world. We'd like to think /r/Privacy contributes to this. We'd like to contribute more.

<TEXT> A concern with Threema is that it's not Open Source and auditable, for what it's worth. But it has a decent rep and EFF gives it 6/7.

Signal is tricky since it requires phone numbers, but it doesn't log any activity worth anything.

Assuming transit to ProtonMail is secure enough for both parties (if true anonymity is needed, then Tor; is the device safe, is it shared? Are VPNs used, etc), then ProtonMail is secure. I *believe* the meta data is protected by the PM folks via their ideology and Swiss location. Check on this on their site, though.

Bluetooth threats exist because BT is enabled *and* the accessory comms may be intercepted. So best practices would be to turn off BT when not actively using an ear bud or keyboard, say.

That said, the BT protocol supports encryption and newer devices (iPhone 7, say) have further modules making it even tougher to crack. 

It's not like plain email, in other words, where it's transmitted in the clear. It would require significant work to hack into. Beyond the reach for most, even most governments, but for say the top 12 ones, if they *really* wanted to? With those kinds of resources, you're safer to avoid most mobile platforms and general-use computers. Total siloing. But we're talking about Snowden Archive level type things.

It's further complicated because you have your writers and site on one hand, and your sources on the other. Different threats, different models.

Have you considered contacting the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press)?

We're getting pretty close to the point where I'm uncomfortable being the sole person you're contacting for protecting you and your sources since worst-case scenario, lives are at stake. You might want to also reach out to media pros who have front line experience protecting journalists and sources, and their life   liberty.

I'm honored. Really. But consider also reaching out to them and/or [EFF](https://eff.org). They have more hands-on experience which is invaluable. 

Oh, and if you do, get back to me (or us via this post). I'd be interested in their feedback on what you've done and the small advice I've given. It'll help us going forward if there are nuances I'm missing. :) </TEXT>

There was a mental slip where I mentally crossed wired concerning using iCloud and iMessages on the first post, but then I corrected it, below.

[Explaining] Crypto is *hard*!

I think that's it? A bit odd since the issues stand, simply substitute the two nouns.

But the main point getting across is my primary objective: 

* Messages' E2E encryption is quite trustworthy,  
* For an added layer of security use local backups on your secure Mac rather than iCloud (losing some convenience).  
* Both are rock-solid to protect from mass surveillance, and  
* Apple is reportedly working on removing themselves from the certification process completely, so soon even iCloud will be totally secure.

Don't mind the down votes, though. It all comes out in the wash. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oops. I misspoke. Messages is E2E and, as you note, that means Apple doesn't have a key, by definition.

iCloud is secure, but Apple needs to see it so they can restore, so it's 2-party. Apple's signing key is all-or-nothing and they won't give it up without Nuclear Winter, dogs laying with cats and quite the kerfuffle. They designed it that way, so that there's no "easy" way to force them (outside a legal demand, judicial review and minimization). *That's* where the theoretical MITM attack comes from, and can be mitigated by notifications. But it's only theoretical.

So using iCloud to store data means you and Apple can access it. There's some nuance in that you can back up some kinds of data but not others. Or not at all. Thus, you can also back up to your local hub computer. No cloud. For those that want that extra level of security, they can do that. If they follow this protocol, they're not vulnerable.

And, it's iCloud that Apple is supposedly working on moving to a zero-knowledge system after the *Apple vs FBI* thing. They realized they need to include themselves as part of the threat model. Then once that's done, backing up Messages to iCloud is no longer a vulnerability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's fine. There's a theoretical threat in that Apple holds the Crypto key. But it's shared among all 120m+ Message users, so if they give it up for you, they would have to give it up for the others. *Apple vs FBI* proved they won't do that without a Supreme Court hearing. And it doesn't have Perfect Forward Security, which is nice, but not mandatory. Rumors are these are things they're working on.

Don't store your Messages in iCloud. That's a biggie. Which means, you need to back up to your local, secured, drive-encrypted-with-great-password hard drive.

Watch your Apple ID account for any notifications that a new device (that's not yours) has tried gaining access to your account (or conversely that a formerly-blessed device no longer can for no reason). This would indicate the (again, theoretical) threat that someone is trying a man-in-the-middle attack. Unlikely and if it happens, you'll be notified before anything bad can happen.

Besides that, it's good enough unless you're not Laura Poitras, Jeremy Scahill or Glenn Greenwald. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're doing pretty good, actually.

Your threat profile is off the hook. 

Most people are human (I think!) so you should consider siloing your work and non-work digital worlds.

I'd consider having work-related mobile (even desktop) devices and then personal ones since it's often the innocent letting one's guard down while on a Sunday afternoon where one slips. Or at least, compartmentalize on the device, where the Apps and things you only use for work-related things. It's good mental discipline that you need to mentally activate your shields when you're using Signal if it's only used for confidential topics. 

Although, then there's the trade-off that you meta-data is screaming "Look at my Signal Contact List for my sources", so there're always tradeoffs (solved by securing your phone and network).

Let's use your original question, are Bluetooth ear buds safe, to show the value of siloing. Use on a Saturday night out so as you're stumbling around with friends? Sure! On a Tuesday when Deep Throat calls? Nope. And, the thing is, since your other comms *are* pretty secured and your threats *are* significant, Bluetooth might be more attractive to them. So for your situation, I've changed my mind  don't use Bluetooth for work things, only for social things (if that).

But only for work. See  compartmentalizing makes it easier to have a life while being secure. No one can be a monk all the time, so plan around that fact.

TAILS is another option (although painful so it's okay if you hold off on this except rare situations). You don't mention [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview). I might suggest [Tor Messenger](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/10/how-to-use-tor-messenger-the-most-secure-chat-program-around/).

<TEXT> For /r/Apple, it's close enough. For /r/Privacy, it's not. ;)

And if we can't be precise, we can't build a decent threat model. And w/o a decent threat model, we can't create a privacy scheme that fits, and works. :)

There's a lot of extra lifting for anonymity that may not fit the situation, time and target. So it *can* be okay that *some* protection is present, rather than none. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the issue is, WhatsApp doesn't sound a klaxon and make the lights flash when  tee hee!  cryptographic keys are swapped behind the user's back. Signal very specifically does, as should any more secure messaging solution.

This is, as the kids say, *very bad!* Double-plus bad!

On top of that, WhatsApp whimsically went back on their "iron-clad" promise to not let Facebook into their App's comm streams, which they now do. If advertisers can see what you're texting, so can others.

Avoid Facebook. Avoid WhatsApp. Use Signal (or iMessage which is fine unless you're on the NSA/FSB's crap-list). </TEXT>

<TEXT> A security backdoor that can be used to allow Facebook and others to intercept and read encrypted messages has been found within its WhatsApp messaging service.

Facebook claims that no one can intercept WhatsApp messages, not even the company and its staff, ensuring privacy for its billion-plus users. But new research shows that the company could in fact read messages due to the way WhatsApp has implemented its end-to-end encryption protocol.

Note this doesn't mean Open Whisper Systems' Crypto is busted. Or Signal, which is secure. It's (freaken') Facebook's implementation of Moxie's Crypto suite. 

The security backdoor was discovered by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He told the Guardian: If WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys.

The backdoor is not inherent to the Signal protocol. Open Whisper Systems messaging app, Signal, the app used and recommended by whistleblower Edward Snowden, does not suffer from the same vulnerability. If a recipient changes the security key while offline, for instance, a sent message will fail to be delivered and the sender will be notified of the change in security keys without automatically resending the message.

<TEXT> Yes, but generally only in a relative sense. 

An eavesdropper would have to be w/in Bluetooth range, with an input device and a way to find which channel you're using, then unlock that encrypted channel. There is certainly a bigger threat profile when using Bluetooth, but there are more likely easier ways to compromise your and your source.

For instance, leaving your phone in your office while meeting a source (when possible) is the best security. No geo-tagging, or any other threats.

If you don't mind, can you give some more details? Who's a likely adversary? What OS are you using? What countries? Do you need voice? App interaction (Signal and the like)? Video? Is it your sole comm channel or are you using your phone as a voice recorder for notes? What alternatives do they have? Do you? </TEXT>

The genome  the final frontier  or just a complex mess of letters? 

Somewhere in there, our eye or skin color is hidden. But also, diseases can be diagnosed or predicted by analyzing the genome. More and more research is committed to finding clues for diseases in our genes. The opportunity is clear: If I know about a disease I might get ahead of time, I could possibly intervene before it starts. Yet: How accurate are these predictions and how meaningful are they? And more importantly: What happens to my genetic data once it has been decoded?

And since it's a video w/o a transcript 

Tell you what. How about I approve it, and you add a new comment explaining what it is, how it affects privacy and the rest? That way, folks will know the context. Bonus points for a time reading where she delves into the privacy aspects (science is great, but we're not /r/askscience)?

<TEXT> Well, if you click thru to the article, you'll see that Mr Steele  who everyone says has superb contacts in Russia and is a diligent professional  based his report on a variety of sources. One could be off a bit (or even completely wrong) while the other sourced allegations not being affected. Further, one of Trump's other go-to lawyers was in Europe around that timeframe. And, as I'm sure you know, the EU doesn't check passports once you're inside the union, so either of these two gentlemen wouldn't have a Prague stamp in their passport (or digital evidence).

That's the thing about those pesky ethics rules that Trump blew off. People like that think these procedures are to protect the public from Kleptocracies. And they are. But they're also to protect those in public office  so everyone is assured there aren't any conflicts of interest to begin with.

Trump He's released his income taxes by now, hasn't he? Divested himself from Trump Enterprises and put the proceeds in a blind trust? Run by competent executors? Shed those billions of debt he had with all those foreign banks? Stopped taking money from foreigners, like the Constitution prohibits? Pulled away from his silly initial notion that hiring members of his family while in the Oval Office couldn't be nepotism since he is "special"?

Good thing  imagine if he hadn't nipped *those* things in the bud! That's among the best evidence he hasn't been compromised that anyone can hope for!

TL; DR: Ethics rules protect both the office *and* the office-holder. We've been doing this for over two hundred years. We know what works. We know what doesn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worth the click-thru. Especially Greenwald's point that, even if you're not fond of what Trump represents, this is *very* much the wrong way to go about doing something about it.

There is a real danger here that this maneuver can harshly backfire, to the great benefit of Trump and to the great detriment of those who want to oppose him. If any of the significant claims in this dossier turn out to be provably false  such as Cohens trip to Prague  many people will conclude, with Trumps encouragement, that large media outlets (CNN and BuzzFeed) and anti-Trump factions inside the government (CIA) are deploying Fake News to destroy him. In the eyes of many people, that will forever discredit  render impotent  future journalistic exposs that are based on actual, corroborated wrongdoing.

Beyond that, the threat posed by submitting ourselves to the CIA and empowering it to reign supreme outside of the democratic process is  as Eisenhower warned  an even more severe danger. The threat of being ruled by unaccountable and unelected entities is self-evident and grave. Thats especially true when the entity behind which so many are rallying is one with a long and deliberate history of lying, propaganda, war crimes, torture, and the worst atrocities imaginable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cat Brooks, the author and head of Anti-Police Terror Project writes,

An *Express* reader also hinted that APTP  and I  condone physical violence. We not only emphatically condemn violence against the people, we regularly step into violent situations to protect the health and lives of people at our demonstrations.

This is true. I've seen it myself. Both during planning and at demonstrations.

As a result, sometimes the violence is perpetrated against us. Despite this, we know we cannot rely on police to keep us safe. *Far too often we've witnessed them standing in close proximity to violence (and vandalism)  and doing absolutely nothing. It is the protestors  every time  who intervene to protect the people.* This is yet another example of why APTP believes we must replace systems of policing with community-driven alternatives that restore power and security to the people themselves.

Every time I've seen vandals, they've been overwhelmingly younger (under thirties) and White. Arrest records show they're overwhelmingly from the suburbs, not Da Town. Without even getting into the *agent prevocateur* aspects.

So, point your online rage at the victimizers, not the victims, folks. 

And, if you prefer communities where no one protests and there are no mass, peaceful assemblies, ask yourself why you live here. It's been a part of Bay Area history longer than I've been alive. Perhaps longer than you, too. </TEXT>

First, the sheriff's office handed him over to ICE, then later claimed that it was [defendant] Chris Kim who had violated the terms of the custody alternative program. They said this was because Kim didn't check in with his sheriff's specialist. But that was only due to the fact that he was being held in jail by ICE 

There are others like Kim who have been lured to the sheriff's office in Martinez, under the pretense of a routine check-in, and then tricked and handed over to deportation officers. </TEXT>

Fast forward to 2016, and Tigas found himself living in New York City, working as a developer and investigative journalist at ProPublica, while earning upwards of $2,000 a month from the appand worrying that charging for it was keeping anonymous browsing out of the hands of people who needed it.

So a few weeks ago, he made the app free. Since then, its popularity has exploded, with thousands of downloads recorded every day. The results of the recent US presidential election might have had something to do with this decision, and its impressive results, Tigas told Ars.

If the iOS Onion Browser passes muster, it's great news that the author made it free. Pretty nice of him to walk away from the $2,000/mo he was getting for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the time, nobody knew the company's repair technicians routinely searched customers' devices for files that could earn them $500 windfalls as FBI informants. This case produced that national revelation 

But the biggest issue remains whether Geek Squad technicians acted as secret law-enforcement agents and, thus, violated Fourth Amendment prohibitions against warrantless government searches. Riddet claims records show "FBI and Best Buy made sure that during the period from 2007 to the present, there was always at least one supervisor who was an active informant." He also said, "The FBI appears to be able to access data at [Best Buy's main repair facility in Brooks, Kentucky] whenever they want." Calling the relationship between the agency and the Geek Squad relevant to pretrial motions, Carney approved Riddet's request to question agents under oath.

The defense lawyer believes the case was built on a false premise that should frighten all Americans. "While it may be that 'Jenny' appears in other photos which are child pornography, *none of those photos were observed on [Rettenmaier's] hard drive,*" Riddet observed. 

"The critical point here is that the image which was viewed and described in the search warrant is not an image of child pornography."

So, $500 "windfalls", not bounties. 

And the defendant didn't have child porn, but FBI agents lied that he did, lied how they got it and lied *under oath* about whether the defendant knew he had the file in an area on his hard drive that required forensic, data-scraping software to access. All of which is material enough that the entire case is getting national coverage and will most likely result in the (non) case being dismissed.

Meanwhile, the FBI can't manage to prevent a shooter that walks into one of their offices from murdering a bunch of people in Texas. Because they're involved in this sort of behavior.

Thanks for the clarification. I'm *so* relieved!  </TEXT>

NBC confirmed the Posts account with an anonymous senior U.S. intelligence official.

<TEXT> If you click thru to [the *OC Weekly* article](http://www.ocweekly.com/news/best-buy-geek-squad-informant-use-has-fbi-on-defense-in-child-porn-case-7794252), you'll find:

Setting aside the issue of whether the search of Rettenmaier's computer constituted an illegal search by private individuals acting as government agents, the FBI undertook a series of dishonest measures in hopes of building a case, according to James D. Riddet, Rettenmaier's San Clemente-based defense attorney. *Riddet says agents conducted two additional searches of the computer without obtaining necessary warrants, lied to trick a federal magistrate judge into authorizing a search warrant, then tried to cover up their misdeeds by initially hiding records.*

So the bounty-seeking Geek Squad individual's "accidental" claim needs to be taken with a mountain of salt. 

Beyond which, once the bounty-claiming person (and his manager: hey, share the wealth!) phoned authorities and had them cart away the computer, they'd run it against hash collections.

The original article also points out the (yucky, for sure!) photo in question was in the database not because it was obscene, but it was part of a collection of (yucky!) photos entered into the database because *some* of those were obscene.

Face it: it's pretty damned skeevy. Our law enforcement has better ways of behaving, no? </TEXT>

Then there's "My HD crashed so please, *please* run super-low-level forensic carving techniques, including areas I don't even know exist since they're created autonomously without conscious thought."

Followed by, "Oh, and can you run all 400,000 files against an FBI database and forward any matches to them? Be sure to collect any bounties  in fact make sure your manager gets his cut, too! *Thanks,* Geek Squad!*" 

Another thing that's alarming about this is, it wasn't a photo that was flagged b/c it was obscene. It was a part of a collection of photos, some of which  but not this one  was. 

Another alarming thing? He's looking at tens of thousands in legal fees, plus whatever replacement costs for his computer(s) that he had, as well. All that's gone, regardless of how the case turns out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Schiller pushed back when I suggested that the iPhones great moment came when Apple threw open the gates to developers and we learned that for every imaginable activity, as well as some previously unimaginable ones, there was an app for that.

That undervalues how earth-shattering the iPhone was when it first came to market, and we all first got them and fell in love with them, he says. **iPhone made the idea of a smartphone real. It really was a computer in your pocket. The idea of real internet, real web browser, MultiTouch. There were so many things that are core to what is the smartphone today, that created a product that customers fell in love with, that then also demanded more stuff on them, more apps.**

It's easy to forget, after all the tag-alongs   me-too companies that follow Apple's wake, how much we take for granted was the result of that first iPhone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are different levels of PII leaks, to different entities, by different people facing different threats.

So, simply because your CC transactions can be used to isolate an account doesn't mean everyone should give up all hope that all their information will be gathered by everyone concerning their entire family, regardless of how harmful it is to them. Your DOB, ZIP code and sex are another means of identification that is surprisingly effective (so, don't give those out willy-nilly if you're concerned).

Check out /r/Privacy for other tips and suggestions. There's no magic bullet but there are reasonable trade-offs to be made.

<TEXT> The point of this article isn't to say that countries can't make rules for what's permissible within their borders (they can), or that Apple should refuse (they largely can't, at least solo).

But rather, that we should look beyond the headlines and see *many* tech companies do this. It's unfair to single out Apple. With the inference that if all the companies had a united front of minimal standards, nations might be more wary of making laws that work against their people.

Sort of like how many companies and sites switched to HTTPS. This change made it difficult to censor individual articles since authoritarian countries could either block the entire site or allow dissenting opinions to be heard. No more cherry-picking.

<TEXT> Did you know when you're arrested that police gather personal identifying information on you? They do!

Then it goes into a database which can then be used by employers serving the public to see if they're hiring people who put their customers at risk. In fact, since: public safety, it's *really* cheap!

But your comment reminds me of a funny story. 

Uber had the chance to do this, but refused. Even though every other taxi service provider has done this for decades  required to, in fact. "Disruption", biyatches!

Then more than several assaults/rapes/robberies later, Uber was forced to do *something*. So they cheaped out with a vastly lower quality "security check". Then they charged each customer an extra $2.00 per ride as their "safety fee". 

LOL. What pranksters!

TL; DR: it's not about your safety as a customer, since there are better tools that Uber refuses to use already. Uber is building up a compelled biometric database for future commercialization. This is separate and apart from Uber's "security check" (which is largely, tack on an extra $2/ride and call it a day) </TEXT>

These an other questions are explored in this excellent academic paper. Its cites are also worth exploring.

People often say that online behavior would improve if every comment system forced people to use their real names. It sounds like it should be true  surely nobody would say mean things if they faced consequences for their actions?

Yet the balance of experimental evidence over the past thirty years suggests that this is not the case. Not only would removing anonymity fail to consistently improve online community behavior  forcing real names in online communities could also increase discrimination and worsen harassment.

We need to change our entire approach to the question. Our concerns about anonymity are overly-simplistic; system design cant solve social problems without actual social change. </TEXT>

Then, use that phone with App, since both are their property. Shut if off (if you can) when not on the clock.

To be fair, as an ISP technician, you're a **very** tempting target for agencies, hackers, etc. So it's not unreasonable for them to want to make sure you haven't been compromised.

____

Fun fact: if your employer offers to pay for your personal phone's plan, they own the account. Thus anyone, including them, can peer into your digital soul. If offered, politely decline ~~(or take some form of general rebate/payment/comp time that's not as direct)~~

____

Ah, they are subsidizing you $50/mo. Technically, this means they can't force you to install an App on your phone that you're paying 50% of the service on. 

See how slippery slopes work, class? 

Loop back to step #1: Politely refuse their offer to subsidize your account and ask they buy you a cheap work phone and plan.

<TEXT> Well, what's basic info for you isn't for everyone that subscribes to /r/Privacy. We put a lot of work into trying to make things accessible and welcoming to everyone, including generalists. And, even those who know vaguely that Facebook is Satan may not be aware of the specifics. Or have friends that need to be convinced, so these kinds of articles help do that.

Same with Windows, especially Windows 10. But see, again, maybe some folks know about Windows 10 but not about FB. We **love** helping people connect the dots. Like vampires enjoying the sight of a long, unprotected neck (but with less scarring and probably more garlic).

Have you scoped out /r/PrivacyToolsIO yet? It's also a good Sub. 

Thanks for listening! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good to know. And your bulleted tips are great, too.

I'd be cautious about ascribing Apple working with companies in sneaky ways that would compromise their users and their privacy. Their one "bad rep" among App developers   advertisers is they aren't "open" enough  that is, as middleman between 1st   3rd parties, they use tokens or refuse to hand over personally-identifiable information.

Bad for these developers but good for privacy and those using Apple's ecosystem. </TEXT>

Another thing you can do (besides leave Facebook) is to a) use it via Safari or web browser. Or, b) if you must use their App, quit it when you're done (by doing that four-finger upswipe to show all loaded Apps, then flicking the FB App window out to the depths of Hell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, all 

So, there are a couple Subs that focus on digital rights and privacy. 

* /r/Europrivacy

* /r/NSALeaks

* /r/Privacy

* /r/PrivacyToolsIO

* /r/Snowden

As an experiment, we're exploring if we could share talent and resources to create a shared FAQ that allows each group to start with a baseline version, that each Sub could then modify. Ideally this will provide easier updates, version control, extra features and all kinds of things we haven't thought of yet.

This is our workspace. We decided to open it up to everyone. More transparent. Educational if you're wondering how the sausage is made. A **great** way for you to volunteer your opinion and expertise, if you'd like (c'mon in, the volunteering water's just fine!)

We have an amazingly talented group of people working on our FAQs, so if you get a moment, please give them a round of applause (and perhaps a comment or two!) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [REQUEST] How large would a bowl of Skittles have to be to hold 3.65 billion candies? According to some, our lives may very well depend on a prompt answer. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-20 07:58:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The son of [a noted statistics expert](https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/778016283342307328) (Trump Tweet Trigger Warning) compared eating a Skittles candy to our odds of experiencing Death-By-Immigrant-Terrorist. Presumably, a *horrible* death-by-immigrant-terrorist, versus say, a puppy avalanche.

Yet, [the odds of this are quite low](http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_1_1.pdf) (PDF), 3,640,000,000:1 to be exact, according to the Cato Institute. 

So, how large would a bowl of Skittles have to be to hold 3.65 billion candies?

Let's say, a Skittles bag is 6oz of tangy, chewy goodness and these 25 pieces fill 1/4 of a cup.

3,650 million Skittles may require a bowl outside most of our scales of references (keep that waving hand **down**, Ms. Astronomer!). So for those unused to very large numbers, can you provide an equivalently sized object (e.g., a cow, a truck, a moon the size of Endor, etc.)

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, all 

Thanks **so** much. Really honored and grateful.

We are /r/privacy,

Dedicated to the intersection of technology, privacy   freedom in the digital world

With 67K subscribers. And it's *killing* us that we can't say "70K" because it rolls off the tongue *so* much better

I'm a Mod there.

A link to [our ad is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/51yomr/rprivacy_ad_v3_3rd_is_the_charm/)

I can't think of any longer term issue affecting Redditors than the issue of privacy, required to develop as people, as we share our evolving, uncensored thoughts with peers. Except for cats, but I don't mod /r/kittehpictures.

We're a busy Sub but we're very rigorous in keeping the tone and quality high, with no personal horribleness, promotion or flames. We put special care in ensuring newbies are welcome and encouraged to ask all the "stupid" questions we asked when we were in their position. And we're very glad to see neophytes become more aware of how to empower themselves and others as they learn more about being private while engaging in our digital (and physical!) worlds. We're also fortunate to have many experts and some journalists covering the digital security beat who contribute. We *really* work hard to be a home for both kinds of people.

We humbly think Reddit will become a better place as more people become aware of how to protect themselves and those they care for living in our digital world. We'd like to think /r/Privacy contributes to this. We'd like to contribute more. 

Please use our ad! :D </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-08-05 06:46:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> US history books seem to go from a series of very negative stereotypes for Asian-Americans (i.e., Chinese-Americans during the building of the US railroads, or WWII Japanese-Americans being interned and their property largely forfeited) to becoming, collectively, a Model Minority. 

This conception is problematic for a variety of reasons, but is more positive than previous stereotypes. Yay?

Were there any significant events that caused this shift, or did it emerge organically? When did this shift happen? When did broader society realize it was offensive and what caused the term to fall into disfavor when it did? </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to seamlessly, easily, migrate all my data/settings from my Admin account to a new, user one? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-17 20:35:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, wise people.

Years back, I did a common, but mildly reckless thing. Rather than create a user account, I ran everything out of the Admin one. Fast forward 10 years and I've got a *lot* of files and settings. I'm running El Capitan.

I now realize it's better practices to not run everything from Admin, so I'd like to fix that. The thing is, I don't want to spend eons moving all my data   settings from Admin to User.

So, I'd like to end up with my Admin to be bare bones, perhaps with all my apps, fonts, extensions. Then my new User account with (ideally) my data and settings. But Apps there if I must.

Can someone provide a link to a way to simply, easily do this?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> /r/NYC IMA 6/8/16: We are ACLU/NYCLU lawyers   reporter Kim Zetter of Wired. Were here to talk about law enforcements warrantless searches of your personal electronic data. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-08 02:30:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We will be at /r/NYC tomorrow, June 8th to discuss [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/4n0pnk/we_are_aclunyclu_lawyers_and_reporter_kim_zetter/) law enforcements current practice of getting your personal digital information without a warrant from websites, cell providers or internet service providers and why this matters. Law enforcement agencies can sometimes get more information about your life from the way you use your cell phone and browse the internet than from looking through what you keep in your home.

All is not lost! The New York State Legislature is considering legislation, the [New York Electronic Communications Privacy Act](http://www.nyclu.org/ecpa), which would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant before accessing your electronic data and restore American principles to privacy in the 21st century.


You can *ask us anything* about these privacy issues, why they matter, or what the legislation will do! 

*/r/Privacy Mod note: We're sure that the ACLU would happily ask any questions related to privacy, civil rights, public accountability and the like.*

*While this is of specific concern to Manhattan residents, the technologies   policies are widespread and designed to scale, so we all should be concerned and take action wherever they live. But do try to keep your questions generally applicable to everyone.*

We'll be back tomorrow, at /r/NYC, at 3:30pm EST.

Wait. What?! Better boldface this part: **You can post your questions NOW and come back to see the answers at the IMA TOMORROW.** 

Its Its Its like time travel! No, it *is* time travel!

[Submit your questions now](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/4n0pnk/we_are_aclunyclu_lawyers_and_reporter_kim_zetter/) and we'll be back tomorrow!

<TITLE> MP3s being phased out in favor of MKVs on The Torrents. Why? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-16 04:23:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This may be anecdotal, but I've noticed many of the torrent sites that previously used .mp**4**s have switched over to .mkv. Really annoying since all iDevices handle MP3s much better. It also seems a better (or at least, perfectly adequate) file format.

And, yes, I realize converters exist. But it's an extra step, annoying and the ratios aren't on point so now I have annoying black bars where before I didn't. To say nothing of the generational loss.

Is it more a FLOSS preference thing, QT Player for Windows being phased out, or something else? Is it a blip, anecdotal or a trend? Thanks! 

PS: thanks to /u/anu539, /u/asstalos   /u/TomLube for very kindly correcting my mental typo. I will write "MP4" 3,000 times on the chalkboard. Well, actually, I'll write a macro to blast it out via 3D projector, like searing Words of Gods blazing thru my consciousness. But you get the point. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-04-14 21:25:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sigh.

My gut and rough numbers in my head suggest that my (adorable!) roommate has gone daffy but I can't convince them.

S/He claims that, rather than, say, getting a box of cat food at the local store, it's of equal environmental impact to order it thru Amazon Prime.

I think the 

(mfr  distribution centers  local store  my car  home)

 is better than 

(mfr  Amazon distribution centers  FedEx driver  home), 

particularly b/c when we go to the pet store, we tend to get multiple items, versus when s/he orders from Amazon, it's a single item, or Amazon ships multiple items individually anyway.

Plus the extra packaging and whatever nominal electricity is used for the device (but probably TMI for The Maths).

Further, the local route is happening anyway, so by my going to the pet store, it's "free" as far as carbon footprints go. Plus one large truck delivering a pallet load of tasty cat treats is better than 200 individual trips. Plus my car uses less carbon than that FedEx truck.

Thoughts? Anything beyond this line of thought you might think would work better?

Besides the whole, Buy Local thing, which has economic benefits over Amazon (again, TMI).

Thanks!

PS: S/He's very nice to cats, so it's probably not worth smothering him/her will a pillow while s/he sleeps to settle the argument. **Yet.** Thought reaching out to you might be a better approach. For **now.** </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-03-02 23:03:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, all 

So, it looks like Apple being served ~~one~~ 10-20 Writs to ~~create a backdoor~~ gimp passcode security to the point where an asthmatic six-year-old wearing a straight jacket could brute-force ~~one~~ all of their devices is A Thing.

A thing covered by a number of reputable papers, general and tech. A thing covered by numerous digital privacy groups. A thing most of the tech sector is lining up to support Apple's fighting this novel interpretation of using the Writ act.

It'll go to the Supreme Court. Fo sure. There will be many stories on it. It is **Important**.

Yet at the same time, we're conscious that some may want to visit /r/privacy to read about something besides FBIvsApple.

We have our notions (I think we're leaning towards creating a FBIvsApple flair, then a script that lets you hide/find posts on this topic, but we're still discussing it in Mod Mail).

We want to solicit your opinion. So, post questions/comments here and we'll try to figure out the best way to handle it.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> With the movement (apparently) with Julian's legal case, assuming Sweden backs down, is he too high profile for someone *cough* us (or at least the US) simply seizing him?

I'd like to think the US is above that, and that would rend to shreds any legitimate court proceeding resulting after he's kidnapped. Then again, the US gov't does a lot of stupid things.

What are the odds? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-12-16 02:45:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, all you wonderful people -

I have two iMacs that I want to move to El Capitan. I have Adobe CS5 on one that I'll be installing the backwards-compatible version of Java Script on from [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US). I have Adobe CS6 on the other that it's critical that it works fine with.

a) Are reports consistent for the CS5 fix? Primarily PhS, Ill   Acrobat Pro. Any drawbacks on having this version of JS on it? Any increased vulnerabilities from those nastier JS-based trojans/ads? 

b) What's the status of CS6 behaving well with El Capitan? Fine out of the box?

It's super-annoying the pain that Adobe makes folks trying to use their software legitimately jump thru so many hoops. I'm hopeful, especially with CS6, it'll be painless.

Thanks!

<TITLE> Twitter App for iOS (or alts)  How Can I Get Clicked Links To Open In Safari? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-09 00:09:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm pretty sure that the entire point of the iOS Twitter App is to keep users inside the Twitterverse, including their browser. The thing is, I'm really uncomfortable with the 3rd party tracking that does on using naked browsers and the vulnerabilities w/ some rich ads. FWIW, I whitelist sites that aren't abusive to feed the commons.

The Twitter App Prefs doesn't seem to give an option to have clicked links open in Safari iOS instead of their browser. Am I missing something?

Failing that, is there an App for Twitter that has this feature?

And: in the extremely remote chance that Facebook users care about their digital privacy, I suppose it'd be nice posing the same question for FB iOS users. See: servicey! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Motherboard: Vape Regulation Is Coming, and It Just Might Kill the Industry. If so, what viable counter strategies? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-04 22:25:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Motherboard has an article, [Vape Regulation Is Coming, and It Just Might Kill the Industry](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/vape-regulation-is-coming-and-it-just-might-kill-the-industry).

It's not optimistic. Very worth the click-thru, but the gist:

The major concern circles around one thing: a grandfathering date that determines which products can stay on the market, and which would face regulatory barriers so high, some vaping advocates say it would kill the business.

This date could destroy the industry, said Gregory Conley, the president of the American Vaping Association, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Just a few possibilities remain that could alter that date and tip the scales between two potential futures: the beginning of a new, more-structured market for e-cigarettes, or the veritable death of vaping on US soil.

Is the pessimism justified?

* Will pre-made juices from independent be banned?

* How about e-cigs (the decent refillable mods, not those crappy gas station one-use kinds foisted on us often by the tobacco companies)?

* If so, will ordering the batteries/tanks etc overseas be viable? Vastly more expensive?

* If so, same for pre-made juice?

* If so, will making your own juice or forming local collectives to do the same be a viable tactic?

As a former smoker whose life has *dramatically* improved thanks to vaping, I can't begin to describe my anger/anxiety. I support not selling Vaping goods to children and labeling. Even banning those (horrible) one-use vaping products. 

This is far worse. It's finger-wagging prohibitionists trying to stomp out adults making informed choices and stomping on legitimate and effective harm reduction strategies that have made a difference.

For context, I use an Aspire CF Sub Omega and buy e-juices mail-order, about a month's worth per shipment.

TL;DR: assume the worst and the FDA bans Vape Sticks   pre-made juices. Is importing around it likely to work? Home-brewing and home-fabricating your own equipment?

Thanks!

<TEXT> Hey, all -

Just throwing this out as one reader to another. I like /r/privacytoolsIO a lot, obviously. But I've noticed there are a couple links that go straight to video (YouTube and the like, although Vimeo etc. would raise similar issues).

For me, it's really hard to know what the post is about unless I can read it. Not everyone has the time to slog thru a video, or they're at work, have bandwidth limits, be on mobile, etc.

And, I can scan a paragraph or so and know an article is worth the read, versus videos I really can't. Or there might be interesting info but crappy production values. Etc.

So, what are your feelings on this? Should direct-to-video links be discouraged? Not allowed? Leave things as-is unless it gets worse? Have MOAR video links? 

It's all good, just trying to solicit feedback. I'm *personally* thinking, videos are grand, but only if the link (or self post) gives context first, so everyone knows whether it's worth playing the danged thing. Again, personally speaking, mod hat off. 

Curious what others think.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey, all -

A subscriber who's a student wants to poll /r/privacy on privacy rights. Awesome! But s/he's using Google as the polling solution. The irony is a bit rich for us, and we *love* irony.

So, any suggestions for a web based polling solution that is verifiably privacy-respecting that we can steer him towards? If it's good, we may make it the default polling platform choice for future queries. 

Having to register to create a poll is fine, but we'd require respondents to not have to. Duh. Google's poll does that, but also does a lot of backend tracking that we're not wildly enthusiastic about implicitly endorsing.

I did a quick survey w/ DDG, and nothing stood out, so I thought I'd turn to you wonderful readers.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [EU] A Game of Thrones chapter, scene or the entire saga. Told from the perspective of Balarion The Black (Cat). Or all of the ASOIAF cats. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-22 00:05:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Game of Thones backstory concerns the Targaryens  past dynasty of dragon-riding, conquesting kings spanning generations. They are (nearly) snuffed out in a coup-de-tat where one of the princesses is among those slain. She had a small black kitten that witnessed the horrors, then grows into the most ferocious, ornery and feared cat in all of King's Landing, the seat of power in the main continent of GRR Martin's saga.

He's mainly featured in the first book but is referenced throughout the series. Clearly showing he's integral to the culmination of the series in a way we aren't yet privy to.

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balerion_(cat)

A Song of Ice And Fire has received some small acclaim and attention. Martin's use of Point-of-View format for each chapter is inspired, since by seeing events through different eyes, the personalities and flaws of each featured character's chapter must be interpreted by the reader. However, the series, despite its small success, is handicapped by a singular, fatal flaw: none of these POV scenes are from Balerion's perspective. Or any cat's perspective, for that matter.

Please fix this.

I humbly point out the feline species has a short attention span, are distracted by small, fast-moving objects, and are easily placated by catnip, having their ears scratched and conversely, scratching the bejeezus out of damned near everything. They're rather fond of naps. While they lack opposable thumbs, they possess twenty *very* sharp claws to compensate. And they purr.

While their mutual antipathy towards canines is documented, I'd like to see a story revolving around their relations with dragons being non-antagonistic  neutral or even species allies preferred. Unless you think writing about a dragon playing against the rules, because he (or she) has nothing left to lose, works. But only because he (or she) has been Pushed Too Far. But then it's on you to explain why a dragon is committing this against-type breach.

And, there must be blood. There must be fire. There must be hissing, remorseless **vengeance**.

Thanks! </TEXT>
