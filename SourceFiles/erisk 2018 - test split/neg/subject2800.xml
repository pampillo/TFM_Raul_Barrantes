<TEXT> It is difficult to overstate how essential the peddling of outright lies was to the House GOPs ability to pass the morally obscene American Health Care Act last week. Much has been made of the fact that Republican leaders railroaded their members into voting for an ink-wet bill that hadnt been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, but one of the main reasons they did so was to make it easier to lie about what the legislation would do, rather than respond to what non-partisan experts say the bill would do.

What an amazing thing for a government to do. Pass a bill quickly before it's consequences could be analyzed, in order to hold a kegger celebrating its passage. </TEXT>

But people don't seem to be bothered that Obama ruled this out before even starting health care discussions. And FWIW, I was around in the 90s, I remember. But if the left is afraid to even propose single payer, then we're pretty well stuck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just can't come up with an explanation for what Nunes has done over the last 2 weeks that paints him in a flattering light. The best thing for the country is for the two parties to be as non partisan as possible and have a public hearing into what if anything went on. Nunes and the House Republicans weren't up to the task. I hope the Senate is. Regardless, the FBI will be doing this behind closed doors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do not disagree with you concerning what we know. But there's more to it than that, specifically the contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. And those could also be nothing, but they've already led to Flynn being fired. Really, if we get details of this   there's no evidence then most people will calm down.

Nunes' behavior this week really looked bad, but the reality could be as simple as the guy being a complete moron   Paul Ryan not being willing to have him step down under pressure.

To a large extent, this was what this whole statement was about: Not pre-judging in either direction and figuring out WTF if anything went on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who, then, is going to handle this keg of Kremlin dynamite? If a case proceeds, the first step may well be taken under FARA. And if that case goes to court, the F.B.I. will need an impartial overseer. But the ability of Congress to investigate fairly is dubious. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees the F.B.I., has recused himself owing to his own contacts with the Russian ambassador. The best answer may be an independent prosecutor, a step Democrats want but Republicans oppose.

And why do Republicans oppose it? Sessions has recused himself. Nunes has proven that his loyalty is to the WH, thus destroying the concept of separation of powers. On what grounds, based on Comey's testimony, can they oppose an independent counsel? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The House Republican health care bill is a pure top-down document. It was not molded to the actual health care needs of regular voters. It does not have support from actual American voters or much interest in those voters. It was written by elites to serve the needs of elites. Donald Trump vowed to drain the swamp, but this bill is pure swamp.

And this is why it is going to pass. It doesn't matter what's in it. They don't have any objective other than having defeated Obama. What's good for the country never enters the equation. </TEXT>

At many Canadian universities, applications from U.S. students for the 2017-18 academic year are up between 20 per cent and 80 per cent compared to last year, an informal survey conducted by The Globe and Mail shows. Even smaller schools such as Trent University in Peterborough, Ont., say they have seen applications from the United States increase by more than 60 per cent.

<TEXT> I guess it depends on what the expectation is. Americans get MRI's something like twice as much as in other countries. Some of these aren't needed, but in countries with socialized medicine it's common to wait a month or 2 for a non-urgent MRI. This is a lower quality care when the MRI is needed. But, no question the US could cut costs quite a bit without impacting quality, just not to the point of say Canada. </TEXT>

Team Trump denied pushing to soften language around Russia in the RNC platform, which is now known to be false.

It's possible that they truly don't have any improper relationship with Russia. It's also highly possible that they do. It's unquestionable that they've lied about their relationships to Russia and their contacts.

The *only* conclusion that is clear at this point is that we need a full, independent investigation. Anyone who argues otherwise is being dishonest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The disparity between Mr. Trumps rhetoric and his appointments has cheered many Republicans and left Democrats fearing that he will not only renege on his promises to protect the governments largest entitlement programs but that he will also slash programs he did not mention on the campaign trail that offer food, housing and child care support for the poor.

I'd expect cuts, maybe combined with a healthy does of Spicer, Conway, and Pence lying about what he said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having lived in 4 different countries, a lot of this resonates with me. Universal access to health care should be considered a right, but that will only happen if voters in the US demand it. Free college tuition is tricky though - when I lived somewhere that provided this, only about 15% of high school students went to college   they were streamed in that direction based on testing at age 12. This is a fine system IF there are sufficient options for students who don't go to college. Transitioning would be brutal however.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the linked article:

If the dossiers contents have been corroborated, then its worth looking into the specific claims made therein and expanding the investigation to include the Rosneft dealings. Could President Trump's refusal to release his tax returns contain the final matryoshka? It stands to reason that the contents could either prove or effectively disprove 45s possible involvement and collusion with the Russian state. After all, if Trumps tax returns list any of the banks in the consortium amongst his lenders, he will have effectively traded American foreign policy for cold, hard cash. Thats grounds for treason. That's an impeachable offense. </TEXT>

For almost all of his adult life, he has been a lover of the limelight, ever hungry for the validation of public attention, from seeing his name in print to becoming a reality show star. And campaigning is the aspect of politics closest to such media spectacle. </TEXT>

*Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before. He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way.*

<TEXT> In any normal time, this would have launched the scandal of the century; Congress would have half a dozen investigations already underway. The public still has no idea what Trumps global business ventures around the world really are, to whom he owes money or who owes money to him. Although the Trump sons have pledged not to do any new deals in foreign countries, that doesnt mean much since nobody knows what the existing deals are. There is no official and public record indicating that the president paperwork is no longer operating as the CEO of the Trump Organization, and hes spending weekends at his private golf course in Florida, hobnobbing with people who have personally paid him six figures for the privilege. </TEXT>

Did Flynn have the discussion on his own with now input from PEOTUS or VPEOTUS? That seems implausible.

<TEXT> Now, there's one thing you might have noticed I don't complain about: politicians. Everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says they suck. Well, where do people think these politicians come from? They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality. They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses and American universities, and they are elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders. Term limits ain't going to do any good; you're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So, maybe, maybe, maybe, it's not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here... like, the public. Yeah, the public sucks. There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody: 'The Public Sucks. F*ck Hope.

<TEXT> In his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump has actively worked to dismantle the institutional safeguards built into the modern presidency. He has restructured the National Security Council to sideline knowledgeable participants in policy debates who might challenge his impulses and those of his inner circle. He has ignored the interagency process in writing executive orders, leading to political firestorm and bureaucratic chaos. He has attacked the administrative independence of civil servants. He has done all of this in the name of addressing a supposed condition of American carnage of rampant crime, illegal immigration, terrorism, and unemployment. As many have noted, these crises are almost entirely fabricated. In the real world, the crime rate has decreased in recent years; there are fewer undocumented immigrants now than a decade ago; the travel ban does not address an actual terrorist threat; and the nations unemployment rate is at historic lows. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I can tell, the EO's don't actually do what the headlines say they will do, in most cases. In this case the EO doesn't remove Dodd-Frank, it starts looking at the issue. Ditto for his EO that was reported in some circles as removing Obamacare, in reality it did nothing. So no, he can't just unilaterally remove laws, but he can spew forth Executive Orders to tell the government to start looking into removing laws and count on the media to report it as if he was legislating solo. </TEXT>

Republicans on the committee certainly have an interest in not embarrassing, inconveniencing, or delegitimizing Trump. So it's up to Wyden and the other Democrats on the committee to monitor the probe and inform the citizenry if it ends up being a whitewash. And Wyden has already indicated that there is information on Trump-Russia ties within the US government that ought to be declassified, that he will push to keep the committee's inquiry on track, and that he will press to make as much of its findings as public as possible </TEXT>

I could get a replacement (one) for around $20 with shipping. I can find similar parts 10 for $4 from amazon, but the package looks different. Trying to decide if it's safe to buy the amazon version   solder it in, or if I need to go for the "official" one.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice for investments for US nonresident citizen </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-30 20:40:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm a long term (closing on 20 years) US nonresident. Taxes in the US are a bit of a pain, but I've done my best to file them. I figured out fairly recently though that I've been improperly filing info on my mutual funds, since they're non-US funds and treated as PFICS. Long story short, the treatment of non-US funds (including ETFs) is horrible, and from what I can figure out is VERY time consuming - the rules are set up to make it prohibitive for US citizens from investing in foreign funds. So, I'd like to figure out how to invest my money without wasting a ton of time or money.

I've followed a couch potato approach for years, and now I'm not sure what to do. Any advice on how to deal with this? I really don't feel like paying an advisor 1% of my money per year, but I also don't want to get involved in trying to pick stocks   bonds. </TEXT>

Assuming it's missing, any suggestions how to deal with this? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My Nexus 4 is dying after 3.5 years. I really don't play games, but I do want a high end display for watching videos   reading. I listen to music on it a lot (Spotify/Google Music) with headphones. Battery life is important, since that's been a headache with the N-4. I could probably get away with a Nexus 5X, but I don't like buying something that long after release. I'd prefer to pay under $500 Canadian, but it's flexible. I'm leaning Axon 7, but I wonder if it's actually more than I need.

<TITLE> Republican platform calls for FATCA repeal </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-19 15:02:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
(FATCA) and the Foreign Bank and Asset Reporting
Requirements result in governments warrantless
seizure of personal financial information without
reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Americans
overseas should enjoy the same rights as Americans
residing in the United States, whose private
financial information is not subject to disclosure
to the government except as to interest earned.
The requirement for all banks around the world
to provide detailed information to the IRS about
American account holders outside the United States
has resulted in banks refusing service to them. Thus,
FATCA not only allows unreasonable search and
seizures but also threatens the ability of overseas
Americans to lead normal lives. We call for its repeal
and for a change to residency-based taxation for
U.S. citizens overseas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last time I put in a big beef order from a local farmer I asked him to include a brisket. Didn't pay too much attention to what was there, until I thawed it   noticed it's only 6 pounds, flat only, and has most of the fat cap gone. Of course I just finished reading Franklin's book   fear this isn't going to turn out well. I'm planning to smoke it tomorrow, any recommendations? Best I can think of is to foil wrap when it hits around 150, MAYBE putting in a bit of liquid. My sister thinks I should put some of my home smoked bacon on top but I think this would ruin the bark.... </TEXT>

1.38504 Cdn/Us$ posted rate (on yahoo finance)
1.3452 at TD Bank (So the bank pockets 2.9%)
1.3656 at Accu-rate (1.5%)
1.3778 Accu-rate commercial rate (0.5%)

<TITLE> Finished IJ, couple questions that are bugging me </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-21 19:21:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I finished IJ a couple days ago. While reading I MOSTLY avoided reading other people's comments - except a couple times where I really wondered about some sections. So, after the fact I did a bunch of reading online, re-read some sections, and a couple things are still leaving me wondering. OK, there are others but these two are things I didn't see much discussion on. Wondering if there's enough traffic here to get some comments.

1) What did the Peemster want to discuss with Hal at the end? Clearly related to the DMZ. Was it a warning - too late? Did it relate to what happened to the Antitois?

2) What's the deal with Phoenix? I think there was mention of a distribution center for cartridges there, as well as Boston. Is there something I'm missing that ties things to Phoenix? O requested a trade there. The AFR discussions take place there. In the end Hal's handlers are trying to get him into UofA there, which seems to makes no sense. Why would they want to get into UofA in his current condition? Why would they even try? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is an ETF really the best approach for a core international holding? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-03 17:01:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I use index ETFs for most of my portfolio, but I've always felt like for an international holding it may be worth paying an extra 1% or so MER for active management. I've been using Mawer international equity for my international exposure ( 5 years now), and it's done well. But I'm doing my annual rebalancing and wondering if this still makes sense. 

So, I'm curious about what people think or if there's been any analysis of whether indexing really works on an international scale. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wife and I have most of our accts at CIBC Investors Edge, and use CIBC for banking. I do like the convenience of having access to everything at one place, but am trying to decide if there's a reason to put the TFSA's elsewhere. I guess my default is to stick with IE, but I'm curious if most people use multiple locations for different accts and why.

I should add, we've never contributed to TFSA's, so will be doing pretty large contributions soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a dual Canadian US citizen, living in Canada. In 2000 I traveled south, and spent election day in Ohio working for the Gore campaign to help defeat W. The results of that election still sting, but at least I know I did what I could to help. I remember watching the results come in, and they called Florida and we went crazy. Then, they pulled it back, and a sense of gloom came over us. 

To this day I can't believe what happened, and the long lasting results of that election on the US. It could happen here tomorrow. Looking at what's happened in Postmedia papers in the last days of the election we can see the corporations trying to buy the election. We know we need electoral reform, and the only way to get it is to oust Harper tomorrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I put the following reply to an article linked on here yesterday, and it was censored. I would like to hear people's opinions, is this considered disrespectful (Rule 2) around here?

*Powerful piece. This is consistent with what the right wing in the US has done,   is all part of Harper's attempt to create his own reality. We have a chance to stop him next month, I hope the country can put send Harperman packing.* </TEXT>

<TITLE> Alternative to high interest savings? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-03 22:13:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I see high interest savings rates around 1.5% effectively risk free (although rates could change). Are there any products available in discount brokerages offering comparable rates? GIC's seem to be  1%ish. I'm looking to open a TFSA (should have done this before) and really just interested in something approximately risk free for this - but really don't want something earning less than the inflation rate. </TEXT>
