But so often I will go to a restaurant and the pate is cold and hard - far too thick. Chicken liver pate always seems to be like this, too.      
What gives? What is the difference in the cooking process when it comes to pate? What should I ask at a restaurant when ordering this, so that I don't end up with cold, hard pate? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cost and demand. If you want subs, then by golly you should write to Netflix Japan and demand subs, and get all friends of yours who want them to demand them as well.      
Each individual project is produced and created by a different company with different budgets and different distribution intentions. Not all subs come from the same company. It's up to the producers of any given project to decide whether they want to spend the extra money on a project to broaden their audience to the international market. However, if Netflix (or Hulu, or Abema or whatever) makes subtitles a requirement (for example, all new projects this season must be filmed in 4K, etc. despite the prohibitive costs), then all future projects will come with subs. So, start demanding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of those internet sites (search engines, databases, etc) are fakes designed to be really simple, and only link to pre-designed pages which are fast-loading and relevant. The reason is that licensing use of a website can be both expensive, and cause trouble in the future if the program is shown on a medium (TV, internet, film festival, etc) with conflicting sponsors. (Like, if a block of time on TV is sponsored by Bing, they don't want characters in a movie showing how awesome Google is by using it.)
     
Some movies do license it, though. See "Look Who's Back," a recent German film that uses YouTube heavily. They actually had an agreement with YouTube in their country in order to use it from the film's inception. </TEXT>

I read somewhere (maybe Reddit, actually) that you are training yourself to eat smaller meals after having been overeating for too long. Your stomach is stretched and your body is used to having sugar and such often during the day in the form of snacks. It'll be difficult for the first week or so to wean yourself off tha old lifestyle, but it gets easier after that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can tell by the other comments here that my opinion will be unpopular, but here's the other side.    
   
Infidelity has never been a major deal-breaker for me - I think that a lapse on occasion might be within the realm of forgiveness.     
But it's all within reason. Like, if I can tell he's in love with me (and you can always tell), he gives me his time and attention and I'm not lacking for anything that he ought to be providing, I'm not going to kick him out the door for having a one-night-stand somewhere.     
But on the other hand, if it's more than a one-night-stand, that is, if it's a ten-night-stand and she has his toothbrush on her sink, that means we have something to talk about.     
To me, infidelity of that level, and if it were really quite often (and that, too, is subjective) means that there's something wrong with our relationship. One of us isn't satisfied - be it physically or emotionally - and it would take two of us to put effort into rectifying that. If it's not something that can be fixed, then that spells the end for us.  </TEXT>

They're probably desensitised to the odour, might be in a bad situation where they don't have much of a voice in the matter, or haven't been taught what a person ought to smell like. I wish there were a nice way to tell them, but there really isn't.     
Just, when you do tell them, be sure it's in private and try not to allow a gaggle of classmates giggling around the corner. There are few things more shameful than being told you stink. </TEXT>

That said, if I ever was burdened with the care of small dependents, I would be sure to:    
    
* have them take up a sport (and not be allowed to quit easily)    
* make sure they are reading something    
* make sure they are educated (as opposed to just being told "not to do something because I said so.")      
    
As you can tell, my parents were bad at explaining, let us kids run wild without taking responsibility for anything, and in the case of my poor, poor little sister, never had us read anything. (My sister, bless her heart, is practically illiterate. I was a bookworm by choice.) But they did their best, so I can't really complain too much. We do the best we can with what we are given. </TEXT>

Not at first - we were just friends for a long time before it got serious. When the crush developed and the relationship began, it was a couple months before I saw him as "the one." Even after seeing him as that, though, there were times when I (momentarily) wanted to give up. We had our stormy fights, but it always ended in an apology, from one side or another. In retrospect, I think that's important, too. Apologies and forgiveness.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ooh, you chose a picky topic. Well, I'll weigh in. I'm a chick, for the record.     
    
I think that when it's determined the chick is pregnant, the dude should have a say in what happens next. He can cast his ballot to keep the baby. But if they're not married (and therefore have no legal binding to each other as a family unit), then the power to choose goes to the mother. Ultimately, it's her body.     
    
However, if the woman chooses to have the baby but the man doesn't want it, the dude shouldn't be financially obligated to it. He should probably be obligated for half the cost of an abortion, but nothing more. It's not fair for the woman to have a say over 18 years of the dude's life if she chooses to play mom.   
    
But that's just my personal take on it. There are plenty of other issues / situations / opinions out there.  </TEXT>

As a side note, it sucks for those of us living abroad, because they are not releasing the same content worldwide (we can't enjoy what our friends in the States are enjoying and vice-versa). I understand the distribution and language barriers, and of course I know that we expats are a negligible share of the market and we don't count, but it still sucks. </TEXT>
