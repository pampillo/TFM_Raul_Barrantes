Funny story: someone actually came up to me and said, out loud, "Ankh Wedja Seneb." I roared laughing. So there was actually ancient Egyptian spoken on Boston Common that day. 

But other people asked me about it too--I like that about signs that need a bit of explanation. Conversations are better.

Thanks again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will take a look at these later, thanks very much. 

I've been thinking a lot about the success of the PWA (People with AIDS) activism because I'm reading "[How to Survive a Plague](http://surviveaplague.com/)". Seems to me that this movement was the most effective contemporary science + societal change movement in my lifetime, and I think there's a lot to learn from it.

One of the threads of this was [Bobbi Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbi_Campbell) and his work, including the campy [Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_Perpetual_Indulgence). 

I'm not saying this is the only route, but it's one that works for some people and some topics.  </TEXT>

But I am enjoying your reconfiguring of the goalposts again. Because you actually said it was about safety yourself:
Or do you think it is more risky, but that the regulatory framework is good enough to make it effectively safe.

But now it's not safety. Gotcha. 

So ok--you have some other theory there is environmental-but-not-safety issue at risk. Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter. Maybe you can come up with something resembling actual evidence for this and it will appear there. Because it's not appearing here.

<TEXT> Yes, right after you support your claims. 

But you don't have a really good track record of responding to evidence. Let's say I give you this link--will it have any effect, or will you just move the goalposts again? 

Let's say I have a National Academy report that says this:
In contrast, induced mutagenesis is the most genetically disruptive and, consequently, most likely to display unintended effects from the widest potential range of phenotypic effects.

Would that change your mind? Let me just get your claim copied so you can't go back and change it later:
You clearly don't believe that the ability to transplant a set of genes in their entirety from one phylum to another is any more inherently risky than random irradiation-mediated mutation. I'm not convinced.

What would it take to convince you? Scicomm pros keep telling us that facts don't work. Will that change your mind?  </TEXT>

**To the NH March for Science Community:** 

Given all of the feedback and responses over the last 24 hours, we wanted to take a moment to reach out to all of you who have shared your concerns. We have removed our post regarding the NH March Against Monsanto event. Going forward, we want to be sure to get your feedback and input on the causes that we, as a community of scientists and science supporters in NH, could throw our support behind.

We also want to take the time to apologize for deleting comments last night. As organizers new to this work, and overwhelmed by the volume and vitriol of responses we did not understand how this could insult others. For this, we would like to truly apologize.

As we move forward, we would like to encourage followers to post their comments and opinions regarding this and other topics relevant to the science community, as some of you have already. At the same time, we want to keep the discussion productive, encourage respect, and keep things appropriate for science enthusiasts of all ages, so we ask that posters refrain from using profanity and making personal attacks. If we focus on scientific research, this can be a great space for evidence based dialogue. Appreciate everyone's passion for science, and look forward to having open and educational dialogues.

<TEXT> I'm not on facebook, but someone gave me a screen cap of their deleted comment. It's astonishing.

Check out the March Against Monsanto (MAM) letter to supporters. It includes a lot of trash, but this should make anyone remotely claiming to be a supporter of science run very fast away from MAM:
As if we needed more of a reason to shout a big resounding "NO" to the CDC's eugenics-inspired vaccination schedule, research funded by Moms Across America has determined that five different childhood vaccines are contaminated with Monsanto's weedkiller. 

CDC? Eugenics? Really? 

The letter is linked from this page: http://www.mamyths.org/take-action/ See the "MAM's campaign for 2017" link.

<TEXT> Well, you don't seem to have a strong grasp of how plant breeding works, so it's hard to assess. 

Are you aware that with conventional breeding you can release a new trait that storms the world really quickly? If you were, you'd know this isn't a GMO issue. 

Here's a good example. The herbicide tolerant sunflowers--a new mutation, nobody knows what it is, nobody had to test it. It's worldwide in a really short time. http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/03/12/148312077/how-a-sunflower-gene-crossed-the-line-from-weed-to-crop

<TEXT> So it's a waste of time and resources to make peaches better only when the speedier GMO methods do it? Really? This is hypocrisy. 

And yes, it was your argument that traits weren't useful to you, so who cares. That's self-centered. 

Your argument about the speed of this trait is entirely bogus as well. These peaches were introduced into the environment not in any kind of fundamentalist viewof  co-evolution that you imagine. Boom--there they are. The point is that breeding has no magic properties that are different from a GMO trait. It's a huge misunderstanding of evolution which always shocks me among people who claim to have biology degrees. 

And that's great that you have the priviledge to take the time to cut those apples up for your kids. Lots of people have to rely on schools and daycares which do large-scale food prep. You should really get out of your own kitchen and understand the wider world.

You are free to use terrible reasons to avoid things you made up. But you are going to get called on them, especially when you ask for that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't farm peaches, do you? Yeah. It's not marginal. And it's also not GM. Why do you hate conventional breeding? And if you aren't a hypocrite, you have to dislike this waste of breeding time (it can be decades with conventional breeding) when your other priorties in your priviledged existence apparently aren't being met.

Personally I think farmers are worth helping as well. We've put a huge burden on fewer and fewer farmers. Sustainable also means financially sustainable.

Yeah, there is [data on the apples](https://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/04/kids-more-likely-eat-apples-when-fruit-sliced). But you should definitely assume this is marketing, instead of the organic industry being nothing but marketing. 

If you are a parent, I'd also be interested to know how your 5 year old does with a knife. Or do they eat whole apples without wasting any? 

What percentage of increase in consumption do you require to approve a product for kids?

<TEXT> Food waste is a serious problem--from picking through shipping to consumer's homes. Adding time to their use really has value.

There's a [peach that was developed](https://www.biofortified.org/2012/08/fruits-of-climate-change/) (and also patented; who knows how it was mutagenized) that was a huge boon to farmers and consumers because it wasn't mush in shipping. 

Also, in the case of the non-browing apple, it may encourage kids to eat more apples than other crap.

So no, selfishly looking at your own raspberries may seem like navel gazing, but if you think about the larger picture of the food life cycle it does have impact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This hints at a strategy that I use. I chip away at the misinformation. I don't expect that every comment section will result in a take-down. In fact, I assume that it won't.

But--I try to find something at their core and undermine it. For example--on GMOs: do you want to reduce insecticides? GMOs reduce them. That data is solid. Farmers in Bangladesh who lack protective gear reduce their exposures if they grow GMO eggplant. Period. 

Not everyone will pursue the actual info and data. But some subset of them will. And if they have any integrity (and those are really the only ones worth trying to turn into allies, conspiracy theorists will always make shitty allies), they have to admit this is true.

<TEXT> I'm not trying to argue against this--I've had similar ideas in the past. But I filled that niche for myself with existing stuff in the Boston area. There's so much already going on.

Science by the pint talks: [Second Mondays (usually, some Thursdays now)](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/science-by-the-pint/)

Long Now Boston: [First Mondays](https://www.meetup.com/Long-Now-Boston/)

Boston Skeptics: [Fourth Mondays](https://www.meetup.com/BostonSkeptics/)

Science in the News: [alternate Wednesdays](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/seminar-series/)

And I go to Museum talks, aquarium talks, city stuff (last night there was a public health meeting I went to). 

I'm also kind of booked up with protests every week now. 

These existing organizations could use your enthusiasm, and you wouldn't have to build it from scratch. </TEXT>

What's more bizarre is the fixation that foodies have with Monsanto. They are the ones clouding the discussion. If people looked at the science they'd see great tools for farmers who have to produce crops without pesticide protective equipment, can get higher yields, and can keep their kids out of the fields and in school instead.  </TEXT>

No, let's not ignore what people wanted to say. Not every sign has to be aimed at who you think it should be aimed at. Sometimes we are signalling to each other. We need to know we share values with each other as well

I was using these two signs as an example. One of them freaks me out. https://twitter.com/subject8379/status/857212304626249728

<TEXT> It's kind of early to conclude anything from this. But I was incredibly relieved to see the support from the public and the first time ever that scientists aligned in such numbers in public. 

I was listening to [this podcast today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2017/04/25/why-a-decentralized-swarm-of-resistance-is-the-best-way-to-contain-trump/?tid=ss_tw utm_term=.dd121bee2ebe#comments), and it made some very good points. We need to have groups active on many fronts--which we have already seen--women's issues, immigration, taxes, science, and more are coming like the public education march. 

And a key feature of these is this (from the podcast):
"It is the company of others. It is not being alone. It is being reminded that you are not only in fellowship, but you are in a community of purpose."  

And now, the March for Science folks have the best mailing list in science. This can persist over the next years with awareness of the issues and calls to action as specific issues arise. Not only nationally, but locally as well. 

If anyone told you it would affect policies on Monday morning, they were lying to you. Nobody thought that, and nobody said that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I did it 30 years ago. Things may have changed. But I didn't have a college degree. And I was a science major, interested in a job at a historical park. That said, almost everybody at my park was a biologist too.

As I remember it, there was some kind of tedious federal form. Fairly basic stuff. 

They had a training period beforehand, so you could learn the local topics. They give you reading time during the period between tours, so you can keep learning. 

But some jobs just require you to check the reservations, not give tours. 

On the other hand, some are dangerous--people don't realize that park police are constantly at risk of encountering bad actors is remote places, or even urban places where I was. Those jobs require different training, though. 

Find your closest park and give them a call, or even better--a visit. Park rangers love to talk to you and help you out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think another under-appreciated features of the park rangers is that they are science communicators who have been working really hard to reach people on these things for a long time. They are on the front lines of public education. People are now saying how all of us in science have to get out there--and these folks are on it. 

The park I worked at talked about renewable energy (waterpower) and technology before that was a climate thing. Our park talked about immigration to work in the cotton mills. And ours was a historical park, not even a natural park where the geology and biology might be the most visible parts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wrong. I was at the Boston rally and there were some signs with funny equations, or symbols, and you know what happened? My neighbors asked me what it meant. So it started conversations. 

Just be prepared to explain your work. And if you are asked about other people's signs--go ask them. It's a fun exchange.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone asked me recently if this was the first time I've been political on science issues. And I said: hell no. 

I've been marching on DC since the 1980s. We didn't call reproductive rights a science issue then, but it is. We have the evidence to show that making abortion available reduces abortions. We have the evidence to show that funding birth control improves women's use of it, and saves welfare dollars. We know that abstinence only sex education is ineffective.

I've been at CDC public meetings on vaccines, where I was one of a tiny group of science-minded folks showed up.

I worked on the ScienceDebate2008 effort. 

I am *so* relieved that other scientists are finally showing up. I am excited that for the first time they are publicly stating how important it is to support evidence-based policies. I am glad they are fighting for the research that improves our lives, our health, and our prosperity. 

Where have y'all been? 

But I'm delighted that you are showing up now. And please promise me you won't stop after this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say, though, that at least at the skeptic groups the folks seemed more open to evidence. I watched as the skeptics approached Kevin Folta after a conference talk, and listened to what they asked. And they seemed to really be interested in finding resources that could help them work through it.

At an early point in my life, before I got science degrees, I was anti-nuke. Not because I understood it, but because my tribe was anti-nuke. And I think that's true on food issues too. The misinformation swamps the good info that's out there because the activists shout about these things. It takes extra effort to overcome that, and not everyone has done it yet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you given talks at skeptic events? I'm curious what your experience is with them.

That said, I'm sure his counting skills are fine. And at these events, it's clear what the turnout is.

I have given talks at skeptic events--on GMOs. I've also watched a lot of talks by others. Skeptics are assholes--I know, I'm one of them. They are people who aren't afraid to disagree. And I've seen this happen at skeptic events that you have to pay big money for: conferences. Not just pub talks.

A lot of people who are pro-vaccines, pro-climate issues, pro-fluoride, still lose their minds on GMOs. It's not just his word, and it's not just pub talks. It happens here all the time too. 

If you would design a proper survey, I'd love to get it out there. I wish we knew more about the amorphous skeptic community. But there are many data points on this one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been marching on stuff since the 1980s. It certainly hasn't all worked like we'd hoped. At the Women's March the signs carried by ladies of my vintage with "I can't believe we still have to do this" cracked me up. 

But I think we've sat on the sidelines far too long. I hope this spurs more local and national action on issues where we deserve to have a voice. 

I also think that our neighbors are counting on us to lead on this issue. I know my neighbors want to support a healthy planet, healthy communities, and a prosperous future. It's not their job to carry this--they have plenty of other things to carry right now. 

If it makes science more visible, if it starts conversations, and if we get any fraction of new folks active on evidence-based policy, it will be a win in my book. 

But it's gonna be a long 4 years. And it won't always be obvious if we are winning or even just holding ground. But I can't imagine not trying.  </TEXT>

For me, it includes the people who are running the science-based agencies. And the fact that the education department is run by a woman who wants to use tax dollars to teach kids creationism. It's the risk to our health by underfunding NIH, CDC, etc.

There are lots of discussions about herbicide use--which, if you understood the field better, you would find are not unique to GMOs. I've seen some calls for more herbicide use as a way to ensure resistance doesn't develop as quickly.

You need to support your claim. And here's a pro-tip: the academy specifically said that the pounds-on-the-ground metric is not the right one to use. In your own quote of it, they say why: "because such data can mislead readers."

You've been misled by whatever your sources are. You could stop digging (which would be wise), or you can show the evidence you have (which better not be pounds on the ground).  </TEXT>

Lyrics:
STAND UP FOR SCIENCE
(sung to the tune of "This Land is Your Land" by Woody Guthrie)

Stand up for science-
No time for silence!
The cure for cancer-
We need an answer.
Hear our entreaties-
Cure diabetes.
Science is good for you and me!

For global warming,
The facts come swarming.
Climate denial-
It's suicidal!
You might deny it-
We just don't buy it.
Science is good for you and me.

Don't de-fund science-
Join our alliance!
New forms of energy-
It's time for synergy.
To protect our planet,
Science- don't ban it!!!
Science is good for you and me!

You huddled masses-
Come take our classes.
If you are yearning-
Come here for learning.
And after college-
Please share your knowledge.
Science is good for you and me!

Our Muslim brothers,
Sisters and others:
We stand beside you
And won't deride you
Banned immigration-
Bad for our nation
Science is good for you and me!

Healthcare is our right,
For which we must fight.
Our vision's global
Our cause is noble.
It's our insistence-
Join the resistance!
Science is good for you and me. </TEXT>

And when confronted with the science that does not show that that GMOs are using more pesticides than non-GMOs did, you resort to namecalling.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not clear on why I can't link to facebook from here, but there's a great video that addresses the tension between science and activism. It's a clip from a GMO film that I don't think exists anywhere else. The film producers came out in support of Science March today and released this to go with their announcement. They asked people to share it around. It's a public page--I'm not even on facebook and I can see it.

<TEXT> This one is the closest to right that I've seen on opinion/editorial pieces.

But large numbers and strong opinions are what give protests their power. Despite internal wrinkles, the positive message that crowds of pro-science people on the streets present to the broader world will surely show through.

Despite the inside baseball that we've played on this, our neighbors want to support us. They need us to lead on this, because it's our responsibility. To the wider public, the internal squabbles are not going to be what they remember about this.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Bring local science-related links and citizen science opportunities to your march </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-10 18:37:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Someone today was asking me about the march, and whether it's really a good idea to get into the streets. I firmly believe that visibility matters very much, and that our facebook and twitter photos will make people realize that their community does value science.

I was also thinking back to the Boston rally, during the AAASmeeting. Now, I'm from Boston and I was at the AAAS rally. But even I didn't know most of these people. The ones I talked to were largely non-scientist neighbors who are looking for a way to support us.

I had several conversations with people who wanted to do more. One woman asked me if there was some kind of science-led petition to sign. Another guy asked me for local events to connect with science. I gave him a couple of pub science sorts of things. 

But I was wishing I'd had some small flyers with links. So I'd like to recommend to you to bring some quarter-sheets perhaps. Put the links to local science and technology meetup groups, or facebook pages, or local science-based projects that you know about.

Some of this may come from the organizers. But if you have something, bring it. It would be great to get these people to future engagement activities. 

For example, in Boston I recommended:
**Science By the Pint**, http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/science-by-the-pint/

**Boston Skeptics** https://www.meetup.com/BostonSkeptics/

**Long Now Boston** https://www.meetup.com/Long-Now-Boston/

<TEXT> What a retrograde idea. It is very hard in cities to ensure that EV owners can charge at their homes, as high-density housing means that many people may rent or share facilities--and some may have no access at all. Making this harder is a way to ensure people won't have the confidence to switch.

But I'm glad to know about this, thanks for bringing it. We have a net-zero city meeting coming up, and I'm going to raise the issue of parking regs for EVs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to hear people celebrate that science give us great things--it drives prosperity, it benefits our health, and it gives us tools to ask and answer the right questions.

But I also think we have to illustrate what the threats are. Do you like clean water? Do you like tornado warnings? Do you like the idea of a Zika vaccine? 

If you have specific local examples, I would also tie it to those. And give people ways to get involved. Volunteer with the watershed group. Join the Medical Reserve Corps. Give science talks in pubs. And, of course, stay connected and call your representatives when a science issue is looming. 

I think it should be part inspiration, part rallying the base, and part call to action.  </TEXT>

Union United folks came to tell us about their experiences. It was great. http://unionunitedsomerville.com/

CBAs are a way for the neighbors to try to hold developers to some commitments for the way changes to the neighborhood to roll out. 

Union United is piloting one in Somerville, but our group and other neighborhood groups should be planning for this and thinking about them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently re-watched *How to Survive a Plague* because they were such an effective and recent science and social protest movement, and I was struck by the power and simplicity of the "Silence = Death" message on their protest signs. So that's the context for what I'm gonna ask for.

I would like to convey that Science = Life Prosperity Health. I learned about the phrase "Life Prosperity Health" when I studied hieroglyphics in college. After the pharoah's name, they would always write L/P/H. It's called Ankh wedja seneb. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh_wedja_seneb

People won't know the translation, so I think it needs to include the English. But I like the message, through the ages, you know?

These results indicate that transgenerational consumption of Bt maize diets is not detrimental to pig growth and health.

You are cherry picking. You can probably fool some people with that strategy. If that's who you want to be, you go girl. 

But here's the problem with that: the people who do the evaluations of these things--like the National Academy of Sciences--don't fall for that.

<TEXT> In the case of farming, you have to compare it to other strategies that farmers would use. So let's say we talk about the Bt eggplants. If farmers didn't use those, they'd use a lot more pesticide. 

And most of the pesticides that they would spray would have broad effects--not just on the catepillar that's snacking on that eggplant. It would spray all over the field, and take out a lot of other insects potentially as well. It also can affect the farmers who have very little protective equipment, in the case of Bangladesh. 

Farmers will have to control pests. Doing it with less impact is better. But we also want to maintain yields so that we don't have to take more land for farming.

So you have to consider the whole picture.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we have begun to turn the tide on the rhetoric. For a long time scientists stayed out of the fray, but more and more are contributing to the discussions now. I think the good examples of public projects--like the Bt eggplant--make it harder to dismiss all of the GMO stuff.

Some of the more organized ways--like the Cornell Alliance for Science work--really helps too.

I feel like the discussion really began to turn when we started pointing to the scientific consensus on GMOs. In the earliest days we didn't have that, because we wait for data. But now that we have seen so many scientific societies and consensus reports, we can point to those things.

And for folks who want us to adhere to consensus on climate science, it's getting harder for them to abandon it on other topics. 

I am personally a fan of new efforts to reach untapped sources--like the SciBabe's stuff at Cosmopolitan, for example: http://www.cosmopolitan.com/author/15789/yvette-dentremont/ I think that a lot of the "official" science communication has been stodgy and 3rd person snoozes--you know? But that's not everyone's style.

<TEXT> It can (but not always). If you are growing hybrids, they could be a mess the following year because of the way genes get segregated among different offspring in each seed of corn, for example. Also, just being hybrid offers this feature called heterosis, which juices up the plants. See this page at NSF, and look over at the photos of the parents vs hybrid on the right: https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=115920

Also, plant breeders are always trying to stay ahead of pests, or introduce new flavors, or changing maturity dates, or a range of things. So to keep up, or get a foot up, some farmers might want new varieties. 

And yes, down the line, you could see reduced effectiveness, yield, or other things. But like most things--it depends on the crop. For your backyard tomato, maybe it's fine. But if you are a subsistence farmer somewhere, it could be a real impact.

There are new features coming out all the time--disease resistance for pressures they face, maybe a different herbicide to use, maybe they don't need a trait they used before.

<TEXT> Yeah, there's a lot of misinformation among food discussions and womens magazines. GMO is one of the fads among many of the folks who frequent those.

There is a lot of testing of the products to ensure that it's not different from existing products in substantial ways (like different strains of corn), and if it's something completely new there might be extra tests requested. In the US the government process involves several agencies. Here's kind of an overview: https://www.usda.gov/topics/biotechnology/how-federal-government-regulates-biotech-plants

But a nice ice-breaker might be a piece like this--one of my favorites. [The "Food Babe" Blogger Is Full of Shit](http://gawker.com/the-food-babe-blogger-is-full-of-shit-1694902226). I think it was particularly effective because it came from a woman scientist (the SciBabe!), and it talked about the things women are reading and hearing about among food conversations.

<TEXT> Nitrogen use is a tougher nut to crack. There are 2 different strategies underway (that I know about, others may know more). You can get other plants to make nodules like legumes do and use the same bacterial mechanism to access the nitrogen in plants that don't naturally do that.

Or you can look at NUE, nitrogen use efficiency, and try to improve that. 

Here's a recent example: [Soybean nitrogen breakthrough could help feed the world](https://news.wsu.edu/2016/10/10/soybean-nitrogen-breakthrough-help-feed-world/)

This article has a nice description [paywalled, but search Google scholar with the doi]: [The nitrogen fix](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6305/1225.long).

<TEXT> It's helpful to disentangle the issues. Monocultures existed before GMOs, and if GMOs went away tomorrow you'd still have monocultures. But that said, there's a lot of misunderstanding about monocultures too. Here's a piece that looks at that: https://appliedmythology.blogspot.ca/2014/08/do-gmo-crops-foster-monoculture.html

When GMOs are being studied, they examine the issue with wild relatives. Frequently it's not an issue, as there aren't wild relatives to crops. But when there are, they evalute the risk. But again, if you are worried about herbicide tolerance spreading, that's not a GMO issue. https://www.biofortified.org/2012/02/herbicide-resistant-johnsongrass-coming-soon-to-a-farm-near-you/

Patents and intellectual property are also not unique to GMOs. 

Conflating these things sometimes lead to people misunderstanding the issues. And it would be unfortunate if people didn't realize how many public projects are out there that have nothing to do with monocultures, patents, or herbicides.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are various ways to reduce the chances of cross-pollination. There are farmers today who grow GMO corn and non-GMO corn on their same farm, and it's possible to manage this. You can do this with planting timing and buffer zones. 

But most of the crops that are GMO right now are not things that survive really well in the wild. A biotech plant researcher (Pam Ronald, married to an organic farmer) once described this as "frankenpoodles". Here's what she meant by that: http://scienceblogs.com/tomorrowstable/2010/11/14/faustian-frankenpoodles-sighte/

Something like herbicide tolerance is not necessarily a benefit in the wild, so it wouldn't necessarily be a stronger competitor. There was a fascinating study of virus-resistant squash that illustrated this too. Pam also wrote about that here: http://scienceblogs.com/tomorrowstable/2009/10/28/sex-and-its-unintended-consequ/

Although the plants were more resistant to viruses, they were tasty to beetles still. Those beetles brought a different pathogen. So what makes them great for farming doesn't mean it would be stronger in the wild.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi folks--

I'm writing to give a heads-up on something that will happen tomorrow. These folks, Kurzgesagt, will have a new GMO video. And they've arranged a discussion at r/AskScience.

https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt [autostarts, warning]

The goal is entertaining, engaging, but not super wonky detailed science issues discussions. 

I helped them with some background, but I have not seen the final video and did not have final editing oversight. I just offered what I knew and what sources I thought would help. However the final video looks, it will surely generate discussion that would benefit from farmer and science perspectives. I was not paid by anyone for this, just volunteered to help get it right. 

The video will release tomorrow afternoon in Europe. Soon after, I'll be up and caffeinated. But there's no specific time like there is with other discussions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, I didn't even understand that part. He claims the letter in 2002 went to Elsevier. So it's not like a law office just started their own journal.

Also, the journal's thrust is "Regulatory". Regulatory is a very specific branch of issues--which are, wait for it--legal issues. It's not really something your average biology department or chemistry department does. 

From their description page:
The journal is devoted to reports of significant developments, public opinion, scientific data, and ideas that bridge the gap between scientific information and the *legal* aspects of *toxicological* and *pharmacological regulations*.

Emphasis theirs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. But my understanding of charters is that they still have to follow some of the public regulations. I was just reading this piece on vouchers yesterday that said that again:
Vouchers are different than charter schools, which are fully public schools that are privately operated, often by nonprofits. Charter schools receive freedom from some state rules and school district oversight in exchange for demonstrating higher-than-average student achievement, the terms of which are outlined in their charters, or contracts.

Maybe this varies by state, though. Here's the link (warning, autoplay audio--I hate that): http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/education/2017/03/21/tensions-rise-vouchers-pick-up-traction-across-wisconsin/98177206/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Surveys have shown that a disproportionate number of EV owners also have their own solar. This is the case for mine too. 

And the program I bought my car through also had an option to source with wind power.  I know other people who can't do solar choose those options as well. 

You don't buy these cars on a whim. You have to think things through. And if you are doing it because of environmental issues, it's likely that the same folks make green energy choices when possible.

That said, part of me wants to tell Trump that EVs can run on coal, just so he supports them. And then charge 'em with my solar panels anyway.  </TEXT>

Yesterday I was musing on twitter about the possibility of public schools being hurt by the upcoming voucher press. I do not want my tax dollars to go to private schools that do not serve of all our kids, and teaches them nonsense like creationism. 

Michael Gilbert, "Field Director, Mass. Association of School Committees" replied to me: "in MA we have a Constitutional prohibition to sending public tax dollars to private schools - would take long process."

I am relieved to hear this.  </TEXT>

I was hanging around with a group of folks at one point who really wanted there to be global upheaval. Things weren't going that well for these folks in real life in the new economy, and they thought that after the upheaval they'd be top dogs because of their secret info and bunker-building skills. It also gave them kind of community. Nutty community, but community. I can see why people seek this out. 

I think it's probably not the conspiracies themselves, but you and your existing therapist need to get at why this gives you a feeling of power, or whatever it is. There is also plenty of debunking out there. You need to think about why you can't accept it.  </TEXT>

The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest.

As long as you can agree to this, you can bring whatever else you want. I even got a UKIP guy to agree to science-based policy yesterday. https://twitter.com/RogerHelmerMEP/status/843862134043922432 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Math. It was an incredibly good investment--if you are in a state that is doing incentives right. I haven't paid an electric bill in 15 months, and now also stopped buying gasoline because I can charge my electric car. And the system will pay for itself in under 5 years. Very few investments in your house have that kind of return. It paid back 51% in the first year (because the current tax credits are so big the first year, later years it will be SREC income which will accumulate more slowly).

PS: the utilities suck, I love not paying them anymore. 

Also, I'm a biologist. Climate change is real, and will have massive impacts in ways a lot of people don't really grasp right now. The environment loaded the gun, but the math pulled the trigger for me.  </TEXT>

I did this at the local Nissan dealer to understand their local etiquette. (It's not the place I bought mine.) He was actually hilarious. He said there's a tesla guy who keeps hogging one of the chargers at night, but if I found there was a problem with abuse to let him know.

<TEXT> Yeah, this is a curious conclusion. But the whole report is just so poorly sourced it's an embarrassment to the UN. You can't cite fake tribunals as evidence for anything, ever. Next you'll have anti-science cranks of all sorts holding chemtrails tribunals and anti-vaccine tribunals as if they are legit. Or some climate deniers put climate scientists on fake trial. 

That's a terrible example for the UN to set. 

I was reading a piece about [Pruitt and the EPA](http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/3/10/14871696/scott-pruitt-climate-denial), and it includes this point:
The dispute is over the *authority of the referee*. 

Diminishing the sources of legit information has harmful consequences in lots of ways. Opening the UN to that sort of nonsense has unfortunate downstream effects. The IPCC got into trouble for using "gray literature", and they really should have learned from this. 

But the resulting misinformation harming the most impoverished is the truly most awful outcome.  </TEXT>

I love how they talk about the need for better plant breeding for organic systems. You know what kind of better breeding would be great for organic systems? Bt eggplants, for one. Bt corn. Blight-resistant potatoes. 

But no, let's not use things that would actually help reduce the need for pesticides because...um...because what?  </TEXT>

Alternatively, you could contact a local beat reporter like the "5 Investigates" team and they might be interested. Then they would track down which items are legit charges and which are not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So after a full year of production now, my household has minted our SRECs and in 2016 we were paid for 5 of them (with 6 more in the hopper that will pay out over 2017).

I am struggling to explain the difference between the utility credits (which are one path, but don't generate income per se) and the SRECs that are like green coupons issues for contributing to green energy production--that we get paid to do. We get checks for this.

So, 3-ish questions.

1. Are SRECs taxable income, federal level or state level (MA in my case).

2. Does IRS for 8835 give any credits to residential solar production (I have no idea what this is, but CPA was looking for info: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8835.pdf )?

3. If we pay income on SRECs, can we depreciate the cost of the installation over some years (and what number of years)?

Any guidance on any of this would be helpful. It's worth doing right this year as this will also play out over the next few years too, so we want to wrangle it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an interesting thought. I've already had a couple of arguments with people about signs. I think attempts to micro-manage what people want to say are stupid. But if people choose to use a "tested" slogan, I have no issues with that.

Not all signs are aimed at everyone, though. Some things are done for the base. I don't have any problem with that either. I loved the slide-rule sign in Boston. But I know it made other people uncomfortable. For me it was: here are my people....

Anyway--I shall ask for #scicomm approved slogans from the scicomm pros. I'll report back on what I get.  </TEXT>

I'm writing this down because I'm going to look for it the next time I have to get a new phone.

1. Go to the Bluetooth screen with the left side radio keys. 
2. Click the Enter button on the lower right knob.
3. Click the Bluetooth item there.
4. In the next screen there will be choices to delete old phones and add new ones. Here's where it makes sense again. I had to delete the old phone.
5. Now I entered the new phone by clicking on that. It does a pairing handshake thing with a unique number. 
6. It's now set up to use the phone's google maps as my directional service (I don't have the NissanConnect maps). Audio comes out of my car speaker.

Worked fine in testing it on the way home today.  </TEXT>

I attended many sessions at AAAS this past week on fake news. It turns out that it doesn't really have broad support, it's a tiny number of users that disproportionately push the nonsense. And then it's read by people only to reinforce their existing perspectives--like those in r/conspiracy. 

But this is a question of the wider world, where we can stop the flow of Mikey's sewage into naive readers with Google. I think that's an experiment that is worth trying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my comment, in case the Guardian removes it:

It's unfortunate that Roger has missed the parts about scientists running for office, and expressing interest in that in large numbers with the 314 project.

And these #WhinyAcademic pieces about how the march won't solve everything get on my last nerve. Nobody says it will. But it's engaging a community and aligning it that will have downstream benefits. Alreadly local groups are forming with new alliances. And these folks will have the best damn science mailing list (or facebook friends, whatever the kids use today) for the next 4 years.

I attended the delightful #RallyForScience in Boston the other day. Most of the people I talked to were *not* scientists, but supportive neighbors from other realms. And I also tracked the media coverage of it. It was YUUUGE. YUUUUGE. So a small 2-hour gig in one city was seen by many others, inside and outside the US. Noise has impacts that are not just aimed at legislators. Awareness of these issues is now raised by many readers and viewers of many news outlets.

Stop whining about this. And nobody says marching precludes other activities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a tip that is useful for any issue. Somewhere in your state there is probably an organization that works on this issue. Might be an enviro group, in this case, but same is true on all political topics. 

They will help you with stuff like this. They *live* to help you with stuff like this. They often have talking points they can give you, they may help you write letters to the editor, they may connect you with a local politician who is open to the issue. They know these things, it's their job. And they love to have a citizen come up and ask for their help. 

If you can't find a suitable state one, a national one might help. And they may point you to a local one that isn't widely known. 

I had never looked on this topic, but there's this outfit: http://www.electricauto.org/

They link in their homepage to a Sierra Club item. So I'd go to a local Sierra Club and ask them for help. 

If anyone has other suggestions about helpful organizations, I would be interested in more of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Were completely outgunned, said Suh, who says there are only about a dozen members whom she can call on to show up for events. Immunize Texas is part of the Immunization Project.

This is why I wish 2 things: 1) Local Skeptics groups were more organized to act on things like this. 2) The March for Science in Texas (I don't know how many there are) will create a good mailing list and have ongoing actions like this. 

We are not as well organized as the cranks. This is a problem on many topics.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a couple of decades now, I've watched politics and personal feelings drive us to bad decisions that will have repercussions for the future. I've watched stem cell research get hamstrung, I've seen vaccine-preventable disease recur, I've watched climate policies die in a constipated Congress, I've seen people try to affect family formation and reproductive choices due to religious fictions, and I've watched people stop plant science progress based on crankery. I've had it.

I've wanted to have a team of allies to call on--to write to their congresscritters, to make calls, to talk to the media, to show up at events, to talk to their communities. And some people have been doing these things. But not enough of us, and not consistently enough. This is the first time there has been any alignment at all, really.

I hope that this march does 3 things: 1) makes legislators realize that there are folks who care about evidence-based policy and that it's a good way to make decisions; 2) galvanizes a team of folks who will continue to network and to act in the future; and 3) show the public that there are many of us, and generate new conversations with people who vote.

Occupation: entrepreneur in the genomics software arena. PhD in molecular/cell/developmental biology.

March: DC, but hope to align with the local Boston folks for ongoing efforts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love data, and the whole Resistat/SomerStat system. I think it was very wise to use data (before data was hot) to evaluate the best use of resources in the city. It's trackable. It's defensible. It's pretty transparent. Few cities have that level of access to the innards of the city functions that way.

I've never lived anywhere with more access to the city folks for discussion--not just showing up in their office when you need something. But at the Resistat meetings, at other city events like all the festivals we have, 311 system, etc. 

I know people hate parking tickets. I know there is dispute about how Union Square went. But overall, I am pleased with the city functions and directions. I know we still have unmet needs--affordable housing, for example. 

I have mixed feelings about Assembly. I find it kind of sterile compared to our charming old Squares. But it brought jobs, tax revenue, and transit-oriented development, as promised. 

In times of politicians weaseling about most things, I appreciate the strong stand on Sanctuary City status. And--I'll add--the data shows we are right, not the Trumpets. 

Of course, it takes more than the Mayor. I like the Alderfolk too, mostly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Posted my comment over there, but I keep getting errors:

It's fine to look at all these different levels, and I see the value in that. But you can also look at the individual level for an even more detailed analysis. 

We know from surveys that many people with EVs have solar on their homes (at least in the US). In fact, this was my process as well: I installed more capacity than I needed with the plan to purchase an EV subsequently. And that's what I did. Also, I charge it only during sunny days. Because I can. 

EV owners don't buy these cars on a whim.  You have to understand the range issues, and in my experience owners are very conscious of their environmental impact. If they can't have solar on their own homes, many pay to have green energy support for their homes. The program I bought my car from, "Mass Energy Drive Green" even offers wind sourcing as part of their efforts. Many owners plan to charge at workplace charging stations during the day, when presumably more solar is online. 

So of the broader-brush higher-level evaluations have led to misunderstandings and misinformation about how low emission these vehicles can be. I think there's more to be considered.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my favorite films, *A Man for All Seasons*, has Thomas More attempting to keep himself alive by using the protection of the law, which might have worked in normal times. It's where I learned the phrase "Qui tacet consentiret". It was a valid strategy. For a while.

However, some times are not normal. His time was not. When it was clear that his silence wouldn't save him, he let his real thoughts become known at his trial. The film uses actual transcripts of his trial. By that time he's very weak and frail. But he says his peace. Soon after, he is beheaded.

Sometimes I've thought about what else he could have done. Could earlier intervention on the King's plans have stopped that train? Who knows. Maybe not. 

But try some alt-history on that. What if he had stood, loudly, earlier. What if he had rallied others to his side with better ideas and moving rhetoric? Could things have gone differently? Maybe. Maybe not.

Now is not normal. But this is where I stand: "staying silent is to be complicit in perpetrating injustice". You can choose right now which path. You can make noise, which we have seen appears to have had some early impact. 

Maybe your silence is working for you now. Maybe you can get through this by keeping your head down. Maybe you can tell others to sit down and shut up and that will keep you safe, right? 

You may not have a choice later. Good luck living with your choice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two things on that: 1) Feinstein may not run again. We should be prepared to launch on any open seat. 

2) We need a bench of people who start doing this, even if they don't win. We need people to understand how to campaign, how to raise funds, how to organize. 

Automatically conceding California is a bad idea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it has been. They are trying to undermine the efforts and sow discord. It's pretty classic. 

But if we can't take some white guys typing nonsense on reddit and on twitter, we'll never be able to take on the big rich white guys who are about to dismantle the US science program, the school system, and will make policy decisions based on propaganda. 

Consider it a good exercise in standing your ground. No group has ever made a difference by sitting on their sofa. That's what they want you to do. </TEXT>

Sorry, you and he are still wrong. Nearly every scientist I know is doing public outreach. We are doing talks in the pubs. We are doing blog posts. We are doing op-eds. We are reaching out to legislators. We are doing podcasts. These are not working. Because here we fucking are.

You cannot force people to look at them. 

What you can do is force them to see a large DC protest on Fox news and their facebook feeds and in their towns on local news. 

The least helpful thing to do right now is shit on enthusiastic young and diverse scientists who are trying to build a movement. Especially if you are secure white guy who has a job in science who doesn't want to rock the boat. </TEXT>

I've seen government officials attempt to prevent in vitro fertilization because the gays used it. 

I've seen vaccine-preventable diseases return because scientists didn't get out of the labs to impress upon the public how important science-based policy is.

I've seen incredible nonsense from anti-GMO folks who go to Washington and are paid to lie about the health concerns.

I'm watching this administration install a woman who wants to used taxpayer dollars for religious schools that teach creationism.

Edit to add: I'm watching this administration muck up work in science labs right now with half-baked immigration policies that are discriminatory.

Standing on the sidelines has not served us well. This guy isn't going to be able to product reports anymore if things proceed the way they appear to be going. I'll still march for him, even if he's wrong. </TEXT>

In the shorter, general version, respondents were first warned: some politically motivated groups use misleading tactics to try to convince the public that there is a lot of disagreement among scientists. This claim was then debunked by reiterating that scientific research has found that among climate scientists, there is virtually no disagreement that humans are causing climate change. In the longer, more specific inoculation condition, additional arguments were added to debunk the Oregon Petition specifically (e.g., by highlighting that some of the signatories are fraudulent, including Charles Darwin and members of the Spice Girls, that fewer than 1% of the signatories have a background in atmospheric/climate science, etc.). </TEXT>

The North American media, several experts said, did a good job debunking various myths that arose early in the epidemic, such as rumors blaming microcephaly on genetically modified mosquitoes, larvicide in drinking water or vaccines.
In Brazil, those rumors diverted attention for precious weeks, even prompting some cities to stop fighting mosquitoes temporarily.

<TEXT> I strained my eye muscles rolling them back in my head. But I was roaring at how bad this was:
Glyphosate is of particular importance to the discussion surrounding pesticides due to its potential connection with gluten sensitivity and gluten intolerance, collectively referred to as celiac disease for the sake of simplicity. The connection between these conditions and wheat was only discovered within the last century, and their prevalence has grown rapidly over the last few decades. In 2013, a major study was published by MIT scientists linking celiac disease to glyphosate (Samsel   Seneff, 2013).

Utter nonsense in every syllable.

It's all been debunked elsewhere, it's essentially a huge Gish gallop. It's not like any debunking would make a difference for this guy. He's too deep. It's clearly not his field at all too.

Probably the sanest thing you can say to people like this is that the USDA tests these things. Our food is incredibly safe. https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/04/04/usda-annual-report-pesticide-residues-food-well-amounts-dangerous-humans/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't looked at the data from this paper yet, because I'm still trying to get them to answer questions on the previous one. But someone who does this work commented at the paper:

This analysis suffers from the same major statistical problem as http://www.nature.com/articles..., see my comment there http://disq.us/p/1f2l0qg. Finding statistical enrichment in levels of individual peptides does not mean that the full proteins they map to are enriched.

See as one of many examples GSTA3 in Supplementary File 3, whose individual peptides have fold changes: 1.250429086, 1.238484564, -1.01582587,-1.080276119, 1.137068576, -1.035566543, 1.042132243, -1.016641487, and 1.00619982. With half its component peptides enriched and half depleted, I doubt the full protein GSTA3 would be statistically enriched/depleted.

Instead, by using peptide difference as a false proxy for full protein differences, GSTA3 gets to be described as a disturbed protein, contributing to the statement:
"The alteration of glutathione metabolism (GO:0006749, FE=21.1, BH corrected p=1.1E5) is indicative that the liver of the Roundup treated animals are likely to have suffered from an increase in oxidative stress." even when its expression is likely not different between conditions.

Their flawed analysis from the original work (never mind the potentially contaminated samples used for feeding) means that they have some things that are both increased and decreased, at the same time. It's not how this work should be done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1 year, almost exactly for our 9.1kW array.

Any unexpected project issues after commissioning?

A couple of times the inverter got wacky. Did a reboot, all sorted. But it was a good thing I was checking nearly daily on the dashboard interface. Might have lost a few days. A couple of odd messages from the software that didn't affect function. Sorted by installer. 

How has the array held up to snow/ice on the roof?

Yes. Just yesterday I was waiting for the huge WHOMP of it sliding off, this morning it's all clean after some rain last night. When it was really cold (15F) it wasn't sliding off on its own for about 3 days. But in the 20s usually it slides off within a day. 

Are you actively tracking your existing payback or do you trust the system well enough?

Actively tracking every dime. We are at 47.96% payback in the first year, and have 6 more SRECs in the hopper that were made in 2016 but not minted yet.

What would you do differently this time around?

Maybe a few more panels. And then I'd move a bit more of my other energy use to electric. Electric stove, for example.

Are you happy with going with the "high" or "low" bid?

I could have saved a bit going with a local Solarize campaign, but for other reasons I needed to do it earlier. I was satisfied with my payment, within local norms. And payback is coming exactly as predicted.

How did you come to be a solar owner?

Housemate (I live in a 2 family home) came home after hearing a work colleague's solar story. I had wanted to do it before, but kept waiting because I was told prices were falling. But if others were doing the math and it was coming up right at this point, it was time to pull the trigger. Also, I'm a biologist by training. I have real concerns about the climate. So primarily it was math, but it was also environment. 

Do you feel like the array adds to your property value or the opposite?

In our area it probably adds, because we have lots of enviro folks here. But we aren't ever leaving except in boxes, so it doesn't really matter to us.

Are you thinking about battery retrofits?

Yes. Our inverter life is ~10 years, we knew this going in. So I was hoping battery tech would improve in the meantime and the next round we'd do that. Also, I'm watching for state/utility programs for big beta tests or anything of that sort. I'd sign up earlier if something like that came along.

Any issues with debris, mold, or animal nesting "under" the array?

Not that we are aware of at this point.

Anyone ever experiment with using heat tape to melt snow off of the array?

Nope. We let all natural physics do the work. Temperature and gravity.

<TEXT> Nah, people really just have no idea what they are talking about. They conflate all the issues, all the time. 

You have come across what we lovingly refer to as the "Asymmetric Advantage of Bullshit". http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/04/20/the-asymmetry-of-bullsh-t-and/

The rebuttal, by contrast, may require explaining a whole series of preliminary concepts before its really possible to explain why the talking point is wrong. So the setup is snappy, intuitively appealing argument without obvious problems vs. rebuttal I probably dont have time to read, let alone analyze closely.

Lately it's also called Brandolini's Law: http://ordrespontane.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/brandolinis-law.html?m=1

You can either decide to debunk with all the preliminary details, or not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, that's a good point about a power outage, and still having access to some heat. Hmm. 

That said, I was not really considering moving completely away from gas. What I am doing is offsetting some of my heating with electric space heaters. That didn't make sense when electricity cost more, but now that it's free to me, it does. 

And I've switched to some more electric cooking. I got an induction burner. I got a cool pressure cooker that does about 15 things. So I've reduced my natgas usage by about 15% so far. I think I can pare that down some.

If my stove breaks someday, I would consider replacing with electric. But I'm not going out of my way to just swap stuff out in general. Next water heater, though, heat pump should be a good choice.

I did oversize my array a smidge with the plan of buying an electric car, which I've now done. So that replaced my gasoline + oil.  </TEXT>

The current EV incentives require you to have big income to take a tax credit, or good credit to finance, or both. It's not very broad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone drove into my pole a few months back. The police determined it was the utility's pole. I never said that was the case for everyone. But in my city it is.

I also happen to live in the most dense city in the Northeast besides NYC, Somerville. We are full of street poles that run the power. I wish it was underground but it's not. 

And I know that it would require the city to work with them. But as I said, we just had a Solarize program which crossed boundaries among the different city divisions. Housing, Enviro, Mayor's office, Inspectional services and the utility--all worked together because our city values reducing greenhouse gasses. It's entirely possible to get this all aligned in my city, if we wanted to try it.

The most convenient places to locate EV charging is usually in a parking lot, too, not a residential street. 

And this is exactly the point. The homeowner doesn't own it the street space, so it's possible to use it for a community purpose. You can't expect people to drive to parking lots, charge for 3 hours, and then move their cars, from far away. It needs to be in the neighborhoods if you want to encourage adoption in high density areas.  </TEXT>

That is interesting, though. I've heard talk about programs to encourage EVs that are like the Solarize program my city recently ran. But I was telling the city folks that it would require charging access for non-homeowners. That's actually a good idea for a solution. It could be card access based like chargepoint, but to your own electric account.

<TEXT> Um, you don't seem to have a good understanding of farming. Farmers choose to buy GMOs because they benefit their situation. They are not "beholden" to anybody and it really pisses them off that people imply that they are rubes.

And this is completely false: 
Now the non-GMO farmer is growing GMO plants which pisses off the agribusiness who sues the non-GMO farmer.

Never happened. When the organic farmers went to the courts, they were laughed out of their suit because not one farmer could be found that was threatened with this. 

Dave Goulson is funded by environmentalists, btw. From a farmer I know: "Curiously, no mention of financial support for Dave Goulson from anti-pesticide Friends of the Earth." Ideology distorts science, as any climate denier can demonstrate. But it gets a pass because it's perceived to be unaffected by money.

<TEXT> I have been keeping track of the return on our investment based on the dollars we laid out, and what we are seeing in electricity savings, SRECs, and tax credits. We didn't factor in our roof issues. We don't expect hail issues. Our homeowners insurance policy may have gone up a smidge, but they used it as an opportunity to review our whole policy so it wasn't possible to extract the specific solar piece. 

We track every electric bill (we live in a 2-family house, so we have to track 2 bills). We have just completed our first full year with solar.

In our first 12 months, our return has reached 47.96%. It's biggest the first year because of the tax issues. But this also doesn't include 6 more SRECs we have in the hopper (because those will be minted in Jan 2017 but were technically generated in 2016).

It also doesn't include that I have shifted some of my natgas heating to electric space heaters, and some induction cooking and other electric cooking when I can. But a casual look at my gas usage suggests I've saved about 15% per month on average there. I think I can go up some too, but since this is our first year I didn't try to replace as much heating as I probably can.

Futher, I have now purchased an electric car and all my gasoline and oil expenses are replaced by my electrical outlet in the basement. I accomodated this in my plan, so I was overproducing solar already and I think I'll still cover all my electric needs. 

A lot will depend on your specific situation, your state's policies, and your needs. But we expect that by year 5 our initial investment should be recouped (barring any crazy Nevada-style monkey wrenching) and everything after that will be gravy. The panels should last more than 20 years. Our inverter will need replacing in 10ish years, but we many also add storage and want to replace that anyway. I am hoping for state programs on that too, though. 

TL,DR: we're happy with our return on the things we are tracking.  It's exactly as we expected and were told in our proposal so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The argument that I was making in that discussion was that you just don't make a snap decision to go EV. You have to think about this carefully. And footprint decisions are a huge factor in this--like yours have been and like mine have been too.

I got solar, and then replaced my 14 year old car with an all-electric car. But that was after I chose a place to live with high walkability and adequate public transportation. 

I also wish studies would look at lower driving miles of EVs, for the same reasons too. I think they (and the owners) are being held to the wrong standards because people don't know how to evaluate disruptive tech.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds similar to the one I got in MA. We also have a state rebate too, but the total sounds about the same.

And it's exactly what pushed me to do it. And I was worried about federal benefits disappearing in the next administration. So I wanted to close in this calendar year too.  </TEXT>

I doubt that I could help you. You have a position that you wish to confirm, not to challenge. And you have not answered why this is something that you cling to, despite the contrary abundant evidence from qualified researchers. 

What source of information would you need to hear from? I'm a scientist in this field. I gave you links to the work of an evolutionary biologist in this field. You aren't qualified to read and assess the very challenging details of the original literature. So you need to rely on specialists.

But, obviously, things like average IQ difference between races explain why there are different outcomes for races as groups.

No, no, no, no, and no.

<TEXT> The one that I used (the Massachusetts one that I posted) worked perfectly as described in the MassEnergy program pages. They gave me a contact at the dealer whose pricing I saw--and the pricing and options didn't deviate from what was posted. They had cars in stock.

The dealership wanted to upsell on the financing thing--they were saying that I could get extra protection yatta yatta something. But I just said, "Do I need to have any of that?" They said no. So I said no. I'm not afraid to say no.

My experience was very good. And I actually preferred going in with the spreadsheet data and their stated committment to the pricing. And having the backing of this organization--a known enviro group in my area--gave me confidence in this.

I talked them up a teeny bit on my trade in. So there was a bit of room there. But my car was crap, there wasn't much to do about that.

But mostly I was afraid the next administration might get rid of federal incentives, so I acted more quickly than I might have otherwise. As I have read more about the pricing, though, I feel like mine was in line with others that I've read and I'm happy with it. 

I heard about this offer because I was the solar coach volunteer for my community. So this organization had reached out to me at an event. I am not associated with them, I was just aware of them from other work they do.

If I were you, I'd see if there's an EV owners group in your area, or ring up a couple of the local enviro groups. Somebody in Portlandia has to know.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you continue to make claims that your evidence can't cash. Not only do a large number of EV owners have solar, others of them buy green power. Some do both. You cannot say that the other half are using fossil fuels. 

Here's the thing: choosing an EV is not just picking between a Snickers and a Milky Way. The people choosing to do this are a strange bunch. They are often already environmentally making different sourcing choices. They buy green power (I know of one who sources all wind power, not accounted for in the solar survey). They drive fewer miles. They choose these cars for many reasons are are already doing things to reduce their local and global footprints. 

This is a theoretical model that discounts everything but the point they wish to make. And that point remains bogus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's what the email said (in part):

Were happy to report that Drive Green with Mass Energy is going well. Weve already helped many folks get into new electric cars.

You expressed interest in the all-new Chevrolet Bolt. Heres an important and exciting update on how you can get a great all-electric car:

The very first Bolts were sold last week in California. Because California has a zero-emission vehicle mandate, it gets most of the attention from EV carmakers. After California and Oregon, Massachusetts is one of the hottest markets for EVs, so the Bolt will be here soon. Dealers who sell lots of Chevy Volts will get the most Bolts; that is the case with the dealers in Drive Green with Mass Energy. We believe the dealers in our program will get more Bolts (and sooner) than other dealers in Massachusetts. We are now estimating mid-February for the arrival of Bolts in Massachusetts showrooms.

Demand for the Bolt is going to exceed supply for a few months, so it will not be possible for everyone on our Bolt waiting list to get one for a while. We also do not expect big dealer discounts until supply catches up to demand. If you want to purchase a Bolt, the price will probably be very close the list price or MSRP of $37,500 for the LT trim and $41,780 for the Premier trim. Buyers of the Bolt will be able to receive a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 and a state rebate of $2,500. Leases will be available too, probably at about $300 per month.

There was more detail about how you might get into the queue. If anyone in MA is interested, I suggest you get on their mailing list for the updates and details. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have just finished running a Solarize program in our community, but it was only for homes, with suitable orientation and sites of course. But the other tricky problem here is that many homes are multi-family or condos. We got some folks to get everyone in ownership to agree to panels. But plenty of folks could not.

We also have a lot of renters who want to support solar, but simply don't own a roof. We would have had a lot of takers for a community solar component if we had one with the program. We may do one in the future.

I think they can co-exist. Some people don't want to own or can't own panels.  </TEXT>

Among the worst places to switch are North Dakota and Minnesota, where air quality is very good to begin with and additional exhaust from gas-powered cars dissipates quickly.

I can't believe they think that dissipation is a feature. It all affects the climate issues for the entire planet. 

Wow. It is an audacious attempt to distract people, though, I give them credit for that.

<TEXT> Ok, I just watched the moral reframing one. I knew about the handbook from way back.

I think the moral reframing is abject bullshit. I have been trying to work *within* the left on the issues I care about. I am as left as you can be--I collected signatures for Ted Kennedy's last Senate race. I was a delegate to our convention that got Elizabeth Warren her seat. I feel like it should be easier to work in my own tribe.

I know the left's buttons. I have the left's buttons. But either the lefties I know are lying about their actual values, or they are in fact conservatives underneath. 

You try to meet them on their values, and they instantly move the goalposts. So you go to the next goalpost. Whoosh! 

Sure, they cling to climate science, and the consensus on that. Show them the same thing on GMOs? It's a conspiracy. 

Hey, wouldn't it be great to reduce chemical pesticides? NO. 

Where do you go with "NO"? 

It seems to me that we have essentially a stalemate. There is no connecting with "values" because they only hold them situationally. They won't come to the meetings about the GMO mosquitoes that could reduce pesticide spraying because they said NO. 

I wish this guy could show me how--in a real life situation, like the Key Haven mosquitoes--how to work the magic. I'd watch, really. I want to see something work. But it all looks like handwavey bullshit to me. 

\end rant

I know it's not your fault. And I understand that you are trying to help. But I've been playing this roulette for a long time time now, and all I keep hearing is "ur doin' it rong" and nobody can demonstrate what doin' it rite looks like.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having been watching this on science issues for years, I would say that I haven't seen anything. There are sometimes studies on what the characteristics of these folks are, or about the topics, but not how to effectively counter them.

And even within the science community, there's dispute. Some people say we have to share our fee-fees with CTers and find common ground, then we'll all be singing "kumbayah". I have disputed this because that doesn't work in my experience. And they can't really show me how effective that is.

I have wanted to work very hard on discrediting the major sources. But some people find this distasteful. And they'd rather just ignore the major nutcases, because otherwise they get oxygen from the attention. I see this point to some extent. But I think public shaming is worth a try. But when I try to do this, I get "tone trolled" by the other scientists who dislike the conflict.

But they also can't show me what works. I'd be willing to try whatever they can show me works. But they just continue to tell me I'm doin' it rong.

<TEXT> The point of science is that you go where the evidence leads. 

Da fuq? How do you think you get to evidence? 

Your failure to grasp this issue is remarkable. And you keep flogging the domain expertise--which we said was not the issue. And nobody claims it is besides you and this author. We call that a strawman in the skeptic community. 

The scientists who designed the brain training experiments used basic foundational knowledge of critical thinking to design appropriate studies, collect the data, and use statistical analyses to evaluate the outcomes. THESE ARE TRANSFERABLE SKILLS THAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO EVERYONE. This is not rocket science, as they say. Because it's not rocket science!

<TEXT> Yes, I did. 

And that's not how science works.

We are trained to use a process in science that is very generalizable across domains. What the researchers did was use those skill in a domain. So they needed the foundational training in critical thinking to create the process, which they applied within a topic. We take a series of courses in college that build up the foundations. Then we specialize in domains. Science is a good system. You should consider it.

I assure you they are better at assessing situations outside of psychology than folks not trained in science.  </TEXT>

Does he understand why we know that brain training isn't transferrable? Because people looked at it critically and evaluated the outcomes. In this case it was appropriate researchers for that field, but the same skills matter in evaluating cars, climate data, financial products, or anything else. 

That was a very odd piece.  </TEXT>

The Red Cross was the lead agency (I was with a secondary one). By 8pm when I got there they had set up and were already taking care of people. There was a ton of food on hand. 

By 10pm we had set up 60 cots and blankets, all brought in by the Red Cross. There was medical staff, which was needed, because people left their homes without their medications. 

By midnight everyone who had come to this location had been process by the Red Cross and either had hotel accomodations or connected with friends to help them. 

That kind of infrastructure isn't free and it isn't something you want to start from scratch in every community. I was glad to see it happen for our neighbors.

<TEXT> The first thing you need to do is check the roof rights. They vary widely where I am. In some cases, the roof is split among owners equally. In some, the area is proportional to the unit size (3 bedroom vs studios have different roof ownership amounts). In others, the top unit gets the roof (and the roofing issues).

It sounds like you might be responsible for the roof issues, but you should check that legally before you do the math on the rest of the system.

I don't know how your real estate system works, but you should ask to review the condo documents (or their equivalent).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They didn't cover the paper session, it seems, but there were a couple of really interesting ones. My favorite was a woman (Kathleen Dyer) who taught college students about assessing evidence in different ways. There was a class in scientific methodology, and a different one on specific pseudoscience claims by topic (angels, homeopathy, bigfoot, etc). 

Students did better with reducing their attachment to nonsense if they took the topics class. 

Her abstract: http://lanyrd.com/2016/csicon/sfmzpx/ Evaluating Education for Critical Thinking: Can College Classes Reduce Belief in Nonsense?
Copying in case it goes away after the conference
Epistemically unwarranted beliefs are prevalent among college students as well as the general public. Classes in critical thinking are mandatory at many colleges, including in the California State University system. We documented the prevalence of several such beliefs and then used a pre- and post-test design to determine whether critical thinking classes work to reduce the prevalence of such beliefs. Results suggest that education that directly addresses pseudoscience does, in fact, reduce epistemically unwarranted beliefs but that education about research methods without the specific focus on pseudoscience does not.

I'm looking for a paper on it, but haven't found it yet. Not sure where that would get published.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, essentially, our well-crafted spreadsheet does the job for now. But we know we aren't the only ones who need this, and we know that not everyone is up-to-speed on excel. I still know people who don't realize there are multiple tabs at the bottom, you know?

We pull our total production off our SolarEdge dashboard. We get the daily stats to reconcile (mostly) with the meter reading day. And we enter all the stuff we get from both bills, ultimately. Helpfully, we're both data nerds and enjoy spreadsheets. 

But not everyone will share bills as we do. I can easily imagine a 3 unit condo situation with one uncooperative tenant. But it would still be helpful to have a total production and unit-level breakdown that's not quite as wonky as our 4 page excel doc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really isn't terribly sophisticated software I think--but it needs to be a bit flexible. 

We were in a 2 'regular' meter situation. State law only requires installers to put in 1 meter per parcel--so the utility didn't have to put net meters on both our units and we were not allowed to have separate arrays. 

So my unit got the net meter. Housemate's unit keeps existing meter. Now we have the 1 net and the 1 regular. 

Now, because of the way this works, I pull the production off into my unit when I need it, right? Overproduction past what I need we can assign to other accounts. 

So, for example, this month we produced about 700kWh so far. I pull off maybe 250 for my use. But that's not shown on my electric bill. My bill appears to be 0 to the utility. However, in our household, that's not sufficient. 

We need to know that I used 250. Then we allocate 99% of the rest to the other unit, I keep 1% to pay for my monthly fees. This comes out as a dollar value. 

So we want to ensure that we are splitting the production and the costs evenly (in our case, in some condos a smaller unit might get only 30% of production, or something).

We also want to track SRECs and make sure those are cut evenly when we get them. I don't mind doing a little data entry for these things, I don't expect it all to be automated. 

But we want to track production, use, credits, SRECs, equitably--or per whatever legal agreement your multi-unit setting requires.

It's essentially an accounting program I'm looking for (I think).

<TEXT> Is anyone aware of software that can track production and usage in a multi-unit setting? I live in a 2-family house. We were only allowed to install 1 net meter. So the meter is on my unit. We use virtual net metering to assign the production to another unit (of equal size).

We happen to be good friends and co-own the house and the array. But there are other cases in high-density housing where that relationship is not so trusting and accessing all the bill data will not make sense. We keep a big and wonky excel spreadsheet of the data to see what the production and use is between us.

This is also coming up in 3-unit condos near me. People need to make sure the usage and allocations are correct. There may be net metering on the common meter, and assignment of different sizes to the individual units.

Has anyone faced this or heard of options for software tracking? Or does anyone want to develop it with me? I'm not a coder but I'm a great software tester.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This exact topic came up at both of the Resistat meetings I attended. There is actually a study underway to fix a bunch of these things, but they don't want to go around changing a street here and there. They are looking at it holistically and considering what to do. But it's actively under review, really. 

But in addition to some of the fixes to flow, this does help to keep the speeds down for pedestrian safety.  </TEXT>

1. Segment on the new high school. The mayor gave the backstory, why the costs are so high, and what the difference is between a Prop2 1/2 override (which would stay in place forever) vs the exemption asked for here (which only applies to a specific project). Also addressed the tax increases, borrowing issues on bonds, etc. Encouraged everyone to explore the facts here: http://www.somervillema.gov/highschool/

2. Covered the new speed limit change option. Used to be that cities couldn't reduce speeds because it was a state thing. But Denise Provost and Christine Barber worked hard to get us a way to do that in the cities now. So in some areas we can reduce speeds which is better for pedestrians safety.

3. The regular police log segment. Kind of the normal crime issues, a few break ins, car stuff. Opiod issues and treatment connections. And the police goodwill campaign reaching out to kids in schools and neighborhoods.

4. The Solarize Somerville story (which I've posted before, here: http://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville/solarize.html ) and also the option for energy efficiency audits with the SEEN program: http://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville/residential-programs.html

5. Oh, almost forgot: the Somerville By Design Winter Hill plan will be published today. Then opens for comments, and then is either adopted or altered accordingly soon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was at the Ward4 Resistat, and asked the chief of police about the recent turkey apprehension and where it went when "relocated". He didn't know, but by the end of the meeting had searched for the details and got the answer for me. At the end of the meeting we had a turkey update.

The turkey was relocated--from the 93 ramp to...underneath 93. So they essentially got it off the ramp, but he's still around and ok (as far as we all know).

Interesting side note: the police are not allowed to interfere with wildlife unless there's some kind of imminent danger to either the bird or to some humans. So your average turkey sighting calls, they can't do anything.

But a woman at the meeting said she had seen a kid beating it with a stick. If she had called that in, the animal control could have acted on the turkey for the turkey's safety.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I attended a community solar conference in Boston this year. http://www.iscvt.org/ncsp-ne/ It was packed with municipal sustainability folks, some vendors, and a number of community activists. There was much interest.

As the solar coach for a dense urban community, I think there is definitely demand for it among my neighbors. We have a high density city (really--we're the most dense Northeast community outside NYC). This means that our roof area for residents is smaller and may not fit their usage fully. 

It also means that many people within our housing stock either don't have roof rights (condos/multifamilies) or don't have enough for everyone. In addition, we have a huge number of folks who rent. They have been left out of our program.

I think it could be done well. I think there was demand. But I would encourage people to roll it out like our Solarize (for residences). Do it by partnering with communities and activists--in cities especially--as an educational/outreach thing. The cities wanted to reach out to people with less means, though, which is not what companies probably want to target. That, and the mobile nature of renters, will remain a problem. People in these situations don't want 20 year contracts. 

If it's true that seniors (with money) are moving to urban areas and away from their homes in suburbia, they could be a good source of interest in community solar. Around here (the Boston metro) we hear more and more stories of this. 

So I can't speak to the actual numbers--it's just a vibe I get from our city's situation. But I think there are opportunities in the space.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of these articles fail to really address the dynamics of the GMO haters. 

They intend to use labels as a target to get to the companies with threats and bad PR. It has nothing to do with how consumers will react, because it won't be up to consumers--activists plan to take their choices away. The salmon is the perfect example of that. It's not because of the label--it's because activists shouted at the grocers not to carry it. That's hardly consumer choice. 

And every time I point out to Ropeik and all of the Label-Chamberlains that's exactly what happened in Europe, they tell me, "oh, no, that was different." 

And just today I was reading about labels backfiring on another issue. http://undark.org/article/in-the-fight-against-obesity-the-real-enemy-is-oversimplification/
From 1989 to 1995, the percentage of new food products with a low-fat or no-fat claim on the label nearly tripled, from 9.2 to over 25 percent.

Part of the problem, Nestle says, is that the lower-fat versions had about the same number of calories as the full-fat versions, but the low-fat label imbued them with an air of healthfulness, and people thought they could eat them with impunity. Any label like that on a food product makes people think it doesnt have calories. Organic labels make people think it has fewer calories.

How many examples do we need? Bad labels deliver bad consequences.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I doubt it's because they want to. I imagine it's required by their funding. If they kept taking money and then had no publications to show for it--after stating that they'd do the projects in the grant proposals--they'd stop getting funding.

But if you read the papers, they handwave over how they can do the work better in the future to make their case. 

*At least we aren't frauds, we just have demonstrated that our ideas are terrible* is hardly sound science.

For years, I laughed at this article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17961488 No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't get DNA into gut bacteria.

So yesterday I was looking for their more recent work. Here they tried to show the Bt protein was allergenic: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27141950 Nope.

And I linked over to this other one that came up as a related paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25564738 Nope. 

It's actually kind of bizarre. They can't prove their own claims, but it's kind of handy to have the evidence that they keep failing.  </TEXT>

1. Many people in this urban setting are in multi-family/condo units. There are legal barriers, or family disagreements, in some. Also, local laws not that great for multi-unit situations.

2. People have been turned off by aggressive vendors in the past. I hear this a lot.

3. People heard about PPA/leasing scenarios affecting later sales. Confuses them, because some could own and not have this issue. But they don't understand the distinctions. 

4. People have approached other companies in the past who won't touch slate roofs, flat roofs, or multifamilies. They assume they can't participate (they can in our program).

Some are waiting for better tech, some heard the Nevada story and assume they'll get screwed. We also have a lot of renters here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, it shows they are a smaller but shoutier group. This is a point we keep making on most anti-science and nonsense peddlers. There are not as many of them as they think there are and they are disproprtionately represented in the false balance sort of reporting.

And they are like crackheads. They have to keep going back, reinforcing their biases. It is probably really hard to break that circuit.

<TEXT> I'm certainly concerned that even if we avoid the shitgibbon in this election, the underlying problems that are pushing him along are not resolved. They will only fester for 4 years, while we are treated to a constipated Congress that's trying to interfere with the first woman president the same way they obstructed the first black president.

It's going to erupt eventually. I don't know whether it will be another terror attack, or something internal like the ranchers. But it's going to blow. I feel it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then you haven't seen the literature about there being sufficient fat in the diets? Yeah, you seem to have some gaps in your education. 
http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/from-mark-lynas-to-michael-pollan-agreement-that-golden-rice-trials-should-proceed/?_r=0
His first concern is that there may be too little fat in the diet of potential beneficiaries. It is true that a certain amount of fat is needed for the bioavailability of vitamin A. However, according to the literature only 5 g/d are sufficient, whereas even in the poorest quintile of households in India average fat intake per adult equivalent is 35 g/d, and e.g. on the Maldives the fat intake of children aged 1-3 years is 22 (11) g/d, i.e. for Golden Rice to work no additional fat is needed in the diet of the target groups. (Otherwise suggestions that people should simply eat carrots, papayas or mangoes would run into the same problem.)

I know this researcher, by the way. I'm sure you'll dismiss him as a shill because it runs counter to your claims, but he's not.

Edit: Looks like we have some downvotes from the anti-science brigade on here.

Oh, teh irony. You are the anti-science brigade here, you see that now, right?

But one thing always surprises me: how much anti-GMOers don't give a shit about farmers. Benefits to farmers are a big deal for me (and for farmers and their families). [Reducing pesticides is a major benefit--especially to poor farmers](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/bt-brinjal-destroying-the-anti-gmo-narrative/). I happen to think that's good for everyone as well. But I guess if it's not affecting you personally at your keyboard it doesn't matter. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised all the time at the self-centeredness of people who can't be arsed to understand the larger picture.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I loved finding out answers. Things that I didn't know, I would research, and find facts that were very satisfying to me. It even began with things like ghost stories and Nostradamus, and unearthing the reality behind those. Finding out they were bunk, and why, made me feel good.

I grew up with tepid Catholics, more of the cultural sort than the religious sort, and the pieces of creation stories and the lives of the saints and their magic tricks were open to question. So I did.

Training in science brought this all to a formal structure. And I do feel that science is our best bet for answering questions. It isn't perfect, but it's better than the other options.

But now, I keep going because the harm to vulnerable people by vaccine cranks, cancer cranks, GMO cranks, and various stripes of science deniers is having real consequences in our world. And that makes me want to wrest the steering wheel from the clown car that they have managed to put us all in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree on all counts. Vox is good at this.

But I don't understand their ire with Amazon. I think the far worse offenders are the actual shit-peddlers like Mike Adams and Joe Mercola and Gwyneth (although they do call her out too). 

Amazon is no worse than Whole Foods (or many other pharmacies and groceries). I accidentally walked into some kind of Whole Foods satellite that was nothing but bullshit wellness crap. I was just looking for a bottled water. I fled. 

But Amazon doesn't write up conspiracy theory and anti-science BS to peddle their crap. Whole Foods, Mercola, etc--they all use their narratives to hit the vulnerable up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When my nephew had leukemia, I would have decked a measles-spreader if they had been in our area. Luckily, we live in a place where science and evidence continues to mostly work, and he didn't pick up any of those awful diseases that anti-vaxxers want to restore.

Good news: he got through chemo safely and is in remission. He's several years past it now--his mom posted that he had been vaccinated and was up to date a few months post-treatment.

Wishing you and your circle the best outcome. And thank you for trying to protect this vulnerable kid at this very hard time for the family. I know what it looks like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had flown out of Boston/Logan to California on Sept. 10. It was for a biz trip that had been re-set a couple of times. It could easily have been the next day. I think about this sometimes and it still makes me queasy.

I was up early the next moring (because east coast wake-up time), and I was ironing my work clothes with CNN on and watched it all happen. It was so baffling. I went into the business meetings that day, but mostly we were all just checking for news and we didn't get much done. 

I got stuck in California because of all the flights being cancelled after that. I couldn't get home. And I didn't have enough room on my credit card for the hotel from this business trip. 

Eventually I got home, of course, safely. But it was so hard to watch from the west coast when things were so uncertain.  </TEXT>

And there are real reasons for this--they have been screwed by corporations, and jobs that used to support a lot of blue-collar workers have disappeared. Things they used to understand, they just don't anymore--technology, culture, etc.

They find it exciting to think about some alternatives--any alternatives--and they imagine that in some new structure their bunkers and weapons and whatever their survival skills are, will make them king of the new heaps. Somehow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So in October there will be this Potemkin "Tribunal" held at The Hague.

Yes, team weenie will be renting a room in the city with the famous name and holding a fake court. 

We think that fake tribunals need some fake news and coverage. I expect to be fake live-texting updates--stuff like: "Woman testifies that #GMO corn once slapped her in the ass." Or perhaps: "Testimony: #GMO canola transferred genes, now my ears flower." That sort of thing.

So over the next month if you have some choice suggestions, I'd love to fake-live-tweet them when we find out what their hashtag is. 

GMO effects, rulings from judges, any other ideas would be great.

<TEXT> Seems to me there are 2 ways to approach skepticism. 1) You can be a theoretical skeptic, arguing about the philosophical tenets and historical foundations.

2) You can be an applied skeptic, on-the-ground countering bad claims, raising awareness of harmful practices and practitioners, bringing current news and issues over.

Some people do both. I think Steve Novella is a good example of that. 

But I prefer applied skepticism. And that seems to be where many of the folks who post here like to be as well.  </TEXT>

If they dislike it, scores go down. Now, next to your comment I see the phrase "comment score below threshold". 

Now, use your logical skeptic brain to tell us all what that means. 

In case you aren't as familiar with skeptics as you claim to be (which we'll assess from your mathematical conclusions), we post things that homeopaths, anti-vaxxers, chemtrailerz, and alt-med folks are doing all the time. You might want to learn more about how these groups act, because it may help you to understand what anti-science behavior looks like.

Its around 11 oclock when a group of activists enters the conference room of the ETH Zrich, throwing urine on the audience while painting Shit on technology on the wall. When they were gone they left considerable damage, a mess of rotten eggs and poo and an audience full of incomprehension behind. 

and
Two of the escaping activists were arrested by the police thanks to the courageous reaction of two local congress participants who followed them.

So they got a couple of them. At least plant breeders are fit enough for the chase! </TEXT>

Then, of course, the campaign to save the mites from Monsanto will erupt....sigh.

But it's such a good illustration that people are aiming at the wrong target. It's not the GMOs, and even if you banned GMOs today you would have solved exactly nothing to help the bees.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Irrelevant is a good way to describe it. People use GMO as a proxy for things they dislike, but there's not a single thing about GMO that is unique and a valid basis for their complaints. 

When you scratch past the GMO argument, you find people hate pesticides, patents, monoculture, etc--none of which are unique to GMOs.

It's actually self-defeating on their part. None of the things they claim to care about are address while they shout about GMOs. But they are completely resistant to understanding this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your data is not current. Where did you get these "glaringly" claims? 

IARC is a total outlier. One of the participants on the panel is a paid activist (Portier). He started touring with the pals of Seralini after the assessment. He's a stealth crank, I'm afraid. 

http://www.gmwatch.org/news/latest-news/87-news/archive/2015/16232-iarc-scientist-to-speak-on-agency-s-conclusion-of-roundup-link-with-cancer

Mesnage is on all the Seralini papers. Soil Association held a course on homeopathy for emergencies. GMWatch is full bore cranks. 

Besides lying down with dogs and getting up with fleas, the authors of researchers cited in the IARC report were perplexed with the conclusions. This was my favorite: http://www.producer.com/daily/toxicologist-pans-un-glyphosate-report/#.VRcWRvrM3o4.twitter

Even New Zealand--haters of GMOs--recently reported that the cancer claims are bogus. http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/83079593/cancer-allclear-given-to-weedkiller-glyphosate-by-new-zealand-scientific-review

Portier actually was legit at one time. What a pathetic way to wind down one's career. 

We have the information. The jury of people who look at the evidence without agenda (or even in spite of) find no link to cancer.

Hi Everyone,

A big thank you to everyone that ventured outdoors, and came to the pop-up market on Sunday.  Wow, it was quite a scorcher! Hopefully, we won't have to many more heat waves like that this summer.  

The Pop-Up Market is Expanding!

This weekend we will expand the pop-up, and include Friday evening, from 5pm to 8pm. Nothing better than wrapping up a week by drinking a cold brewski at Winter Hill Brewery, and then grabbing fresh produce for the weekend. 

Once again this week, we'll have freshly picked local watermelon, both the red and yellow varieties, from Applefield Farm in Stow, MA. They're super sweet and refreshing, and sold out before noon last Saturday.  We will also have local baby bok choy, local beefsteak tomatoes, kale, mangos, purple bell peppers and much more. 

Where: Winter Hill Brewery - 328 Broadway Somerville, Ma
Friday 8/19 from 5pm to 8pm
Saturday 8/20 from 10am to 3pm
Sunday 8/21 from 10am to 3pm
See you this weekend! </TEXT>

Get off at South Station, and go upstairs. At South Station you look for this Silver Line sign, or ask someone to point you there: http://subwaynut.com/mbta/red_line/south_station/south_station17.jpg

Then you just take the Silver Line to the airport, no more changes. The Silver line looks like busses, it's not on rails. You can see more photos of South Station at that person's site: http://subwaynut.com/mbta/red_line/south_station/

The precipitous drop in stomach cancer since the 1930s is actually astonishing.

<TEXT> That's an important realization you are coming to. Don't fight it.

I find the "attraction" stuff particularly toxic when people try to blame cancer patients for their problems. Can you imagine how hard it is to feel shitty from cancer and then feel shitty because people think you caused it yourself?

This isn't the same as setting goals and working towards them with concrete actions. That still works in the right structure (not always if you are raised in poverty and had a terrible education, for example--but imagine how this feels to those folks too). 

Good for you for looking harder at this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey solar enthusiasts--

I wanted to create a post here in case any of my neighbors went searching for solar info. Our program has just launched and we hope that more of our neighbors can solarize (and as many as possible before the SRECII program changes). 

Press release with details: http://www.somervillema.gov/news/solarize-campaign-sets-goal-200-somerville-property-owners-commit-install-solar-panels-0

Program website: http://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville/solarize

Video intro: https://youtu.be/rbOSvYLHAWI

If you have any great ideas about novel outreach that has worked in your communities, I'd love to hear about them.

<DATE> 2016-07-13 21:08:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello neighbors:

We wanted to let you know that very soon we'll be making the big announcements about the program, and the educational outreach activities are about to begin. So be sure to stay tuned for dates and locations where you can hear about the features of the program, it's coming very shortly.

Like other Solarize Mass communities, we will be offering residents a way to obtain solar PV for their homes in various manners. This can be outright purchase of a system, or with Mass Solar Loan assistance, or through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). A PPA is an agreement where the system is owned/maintained by a third party financier and then a homeowner purchases the power that's being produced on their roof for a lesser rate than what they are currently paying their utility. These choices can reduce the cost of green power for you. We hope to help you decide what might be right, if you are interested in solar power.

If you have been considering solar, you should think about acting soon. The state's Department of Energy Resources (DOER) is making changes to the SRECII program, which is where "Solar Renewable Energy Credits" are assigned value. SRECII will stop taking new projects, replaced by an SRECIII program. We don't have the details for SRECIII yet. But if you want to obtain solar under the existing incentive structure, you have to act before January 8, 2017. 

So be sure to watch for email notices soon, and our city Solarize web site will begin to reflect the program features as well. 

Thanks for your interest.

[This can be shared with your social media networks if you want to tell your friends and neighbors.]

I'm the solar coach, Mary. You can sign up on our web site to be notified as soon as our real launch goes out publicly, or check back there soon for the press release and other details: http://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville/solarize.html </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been looking for this number for a really long time. Finally a new report out from USDA on GMO/organic coexistence gives this:

Nationwide, a total of 87 farms in 20 States reported an economic loss in at least 1 year between 2011 and 2014.^10 These farmers reported a total of nearly $6.1 million in economic losses during
this period, accounting for an estimated 0.4 percent of the total value of farm sales for all 9 crops with GE counterparts during 2011-2014.

USDAs national organic producer survey in 2014 also reported the number of organic farms experiencing an economic loss prior to 2011. In 2006-2010, only two farmers reported losses; no losses
were reported prior to 2006.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The filters wouldn't let me repost this article, saying it's already been posted. This is so. But there has been an update. They are sort of backing down. Because someone scienced.

http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2987024/pandoras_box_how_gm_mosquitos_could_have_caused_brazils_microcephaly_diasaster.html

Key tidbit:
It appears that the hypothesis set out above is probably incorrect, and this must be a matter of considerable relief to all concerned. 

Yeah. And every shit peddler who pushed it is rushing to issue a correction right now. I'm sure. Watch your facebook for all those corrections.

<TEXT> Hey folks--

Thanks so much for the input you gave on the session we had at [Boston Skeptics](http://bostonskeptics.com/2015/06/sitp-larry-gilbertson-on-gmos-and-biotech/), which I called "Skeptics Ask Monsanto". I took skeptics' questions and made them the foundation of the discussion, as you can see. Some questions were fused together because they were similar concerns.  But there were also good questions from the floor spurred by the good foundation you helped me to create.

The blog post linked below has some highlights in case you can't be arsed to watch the [2 hour video](https://vimeo.com/132447651). But thanks for helping to craft the conversation.

If anyone can be bothered to watch, please feel free to offer additional questions, or constructive criticism about how it went. Two more local skeptics groups have asked us to do the same thing--Cape Ann, and Granite State Skeptics. So we can take new questions or refine it in other ways (needs to be shorter, for sure).

So thanks for your help, team skeptic. I hope we got some answers you are interested in. If not, let me know and I can ask for more clarification. Or we can discuss things in more detail. 

PS: I asked for the shill shirts, but was unable to get them. But they have heard your desire for them. I will keep at it....

Anyway, it's an interesting discussion about several topics of relevance to skeptics: media, science journalism, science and publication in predatory journals, open access, role of scientists in challenging bad claims, etc. 

It's an audio show. http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/to-the-point/the-bitter-truth-on-junk-science </TEXT>

<TITLE> What would it help you to hear from Monsanto? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-28 17:11:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been hanging around with the Boston Skeptics, and we would like to have a speaker from Monsanto come and speak to the group. We have a chance to direct the content a bit. 

I know skeptics aren't unified on the GMO issue. But I appreciate that most of them are at least open to hearing the data from the other side of their concerns. 

So here's my request for your questions: if you could hear from Monsanto, what would you like to have them address?

Alternatively, what myths do you think they need to tackle the most? What data might help you in discussions around the 'tubz on topics you face out there? 

For example, I'm going to ask about:

1. Biodiversity. It seems to me that people think there is just 1 kind of corn out there. How many varieties of corn are available to farmers? What differs among them?

2. The technology agreement: can you clarify if farmers are bound to your company and your chemistry in perpetuity? 

That sort of thing, really specific about Monsanto's science and business.

I hope this doesn't devolve into threads of wild claims on the conspiracies and chemtrails and all. I am really asking for guidance on some constructive ways to move the discussion out of those kinds of ruts. 

EDIT on day 2: Thanks very much for the helpful ideas, everyone. I will try to get these issues discussed. I will also press for a video, but if I can't get one, I'll take good notes and bring back a report somehow. 

EDIT (much later): The official announcement it out. If anyone wants to join us, the details are here: http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/boston-skeptics-in-the-pub-dr-larry-gilbertson

And I will use the real questions from this thread as part of the discussion. Thanks for your help on this. 

Edit July 7, 2015: for anyone who finds this thread later, the follow-up post and video I did based on this discussion can be found here: http://www.biofortified.org/2015/07/skeptics-ask-monsanto/ </TEXT>

<TITLE> Boston Skeptics SitP Monday April 6 2015. Gluten. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-02 22:25:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Boston Skeptics group continues to fire up at the new location at The Burren in Davis Square, Somerville. [right on the T red line]

Next Monday's talk is about gluten. It's given by Alessio Fasano. I saw him speak at the recent NAS panel on food safety and GMOs and I was completely perplexed about what he was saying. So I'm hoping for the opportunity to clarify some of the things in person.

Here is that talk: https://vimeo.com/album/3318277/video/123106720

I was really baffled by his throwing stuff out there, and then walking it back, and have no idea what his ultimate conclusion was. It was funny to see him describe the Samsel and Seneff correlation work as being akin to the rate of murders and use of IE--in other words, bunk. But mostly I still had no idea what he was getting to. 

He acknowledged that wheat is not GMO. So I guess he faults conventional breeding....?

Here is one of his slides that I edited with some helpful time notation. https://twitter.com/subject8379/status/573592430555086849

Anyway, I'll be at The Burren with some questions. Would love to see more local folks active IRL with the skeptics.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Taking on people who are *wrong on the internet* is not generally hard. There are ways to make noise here, comment threads, your own blogs, etc. 

However, there have been cases of kids being the issue advocates who are wrong--and this is a tougher situation. You can't challenge kids the same way. 

One example I saw was this kid at a TEDx: http://kfolta.blogspot.com/2012/04/more-tedx-credulity-sad-sad-talk.html So one mechanism was to go to the TED folks and talk about credibility. It's not solved, but they did attempt to clamp down on it. But still--the kid is out spreading nonsense: [Birke on the Farm](https://archive.today/crWNv).

That kid who published a book on heaven: [Boy Says He Didn't Go To Heaven; Publisher Says It Will Pull Book](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/01/15/377589757/boy-says-he-didn-t-go-to-heaven-publisher-says-it-will-pull-book). You can't go after an injured kid. This story collapsed of its own accord. 

Recently there's been a young woman name Rachel Parent on the same path. [Nonsense at TEDx](http://debunkingdenialism.com/2014/12/20/why-rachel-parent-is-wrong-about-genetically-modified-foods/), TV appearances, and founding a ["kids" organization against GMOs](https://archive.today/s6Lvv). 

It certainly had the whiff of being stage-managed, but I never looked any deeper into it. I saw others point out that Parent is also peddling vaccine misinformation lately. https://twitter.com/RachelsNews/status/553636386566594561

Young ideologues are one thing. At some point they won't be cute anymore, and media will vanish. But it turns out, there's more to Rachel's story. The [Parent family owns alt-med franchises](http://youtu.be/H8ei-M5pGUw). (The value of the biz seems wrong here, that seems industry-wide. But still, it's a big money enterprise.) This moves the issue from uneducated juvenile to profiteer of dangerous ideas--like avoiding vaccinating and treating with homeopathic nonsense.

But what can you do about this? Does anyone have ideas about how to tackle these kinds of situations? What works? What doesn't work? Discussion welcomed.  </TEXT>

DO NOT GIVE THIS PROJECT ANY MONEY. But I was afraid the video would vanish after the project fails (which it will in a few hours). It's a classic of narcissism, Galileo Gambit, and the suppression of scientific truth, of course. And that's only the first 10 minutes. It's an hour long.

<TITLE> Air your top Festivus skeptic grievance. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-23 15:24:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been musing this gray Festivus morning about my top grievance this year. It's hard to pick one. Mike Adams' hit list of scientists and science writers was way up there [Are these science writers and publications facing death threats for covering GMOs?](https://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2014/07/are-these-science-writers-and-publications-facing-death-threats-for-covering-gmos/), but he's a two-bit huckster and has little credibility among sane people. 

The FUDbabe is well covered by others. Again, a minor player in the wider scheme of things.

I nominate Greenpeace for my top grievance. I am irked that they have not been jailed for damaging an ancient cultural artifact and research site. I also regret that the have not been brought to the International Court of Justice [for opposition to Golden Rice yet](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nobel-laureate-bats-for-gm-crops/article5441159.ece). 

They have international footing and the capacity for more real and widespread damage to science and solutions, so they are my top skeptic grievance. 

I pass the pole to you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> FoodBabe has tweeted that she is being rebuffed by health magazines, because of the incident with the recent cover appearance she had on *Experience Life* magazine.

For those who weren't aware of how this transpired, when FoodBabe appeared on the cover, the readership of the magazine that preferred facts rather than Foodbabe rebelled. They accosted the magazine folks via social media, they trashed the Amazon reviews, and it completely unwound when the magazine claimed it was a concerted effort by the food industry enemies of FoodBabe. 

The Foodbabe also thinks everyone who dislikes her earns 60 per post/tweet/etc. 

Sometimes it's hard to know if commenting pays off. I think this is evidence that is did.

Foodbabe reports the rebuffing: https://twitter.com/thefoodbabe/status/523199680680038400

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recently this project came to my attention. I'm not going to link to the page, because last time I tried that my post vaporized. But I thought this was a really clever and pro-active way to make a point. And have some nice healthy squash. A skeptic group has raised funds to plant a garden of GMO squash, as a way to demonstrate the value of this tool, and as a way to possibly get legal standing for the future.

Most of the time we find ourselves on defense, and it was great to see a group find a way to go on offense. And yes--team anti-GMO is offended already, so it's already a win. 

Way to go Humboldt Skeptics! 

[Humboldt Skeptics Squash Garden Project Fundraiser](http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y147/mem_from_somerville/Humboldt_squash_garden_zps8f870002.jpg)

*I am not affiliated with this group, and do not seek funds for it, it's all funded. I just loved the idea of this project.*

EDIT: I found a link that isn't the fundraiser site so it might not disappear my post...
