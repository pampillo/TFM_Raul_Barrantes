<TEXT> You posted me on /r/Gatekeeping which makes absolutely no sense, I absolutely cannot stand socialism, or any government handouts. I'm a libertarian. 

I'm simply correcting you, the ideology you stated that you pursue, is not socialism. 

Socialism is Venezuela. Go look at its current news. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only 'definition changes' are ones perpetrated by people who believe in a philosophy but don't want it associated with a previous failure. Communism is a form of socialism, and both have complete control over the means of production. An ideology does not change definition. Only the people change. You are not a socialist. </TEXT>

I'm sorry, but that's not socialism.

What you're referring to is state capitalism.

Socialism still has complete control over the means of production. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do I think socialism is good? Yes

Can I be so dear as to ask why? Have you taken any economics courses? Are you aware of the result of the USSR, Venuzeuala, Cuba, North Korea, Hungary, Poland, Somalia, Egypt, Lybia, Iraq, etc?

Humans are naturally good. People donate, give to charities, adopt, and privately help people suffering under the poverty line. The people who get into power are never good people, so why wouldn't you want to minimize the size of the state rather than have the state be your church when it comes to whether or not you'll be able to eat tonight? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry but I really don't understand what we are doing celebrating this win.

1: Macrons entire campaign was created by Frances previous socialist president.

2: He loves the EU.

3: His Friday email leaks were pretty ehhhhh, he even compared himself to Hillary about it.

4: Former Rothschild banker.

5: Had opinion polls before his campaign in order to be able to say exactly what the public wanted. All of his opinions are crafted, extremely unlikely to be the truth.

6: Since when did we like centrism? Libertarianism is far right by all aspects.

7: A right wing statist that would bring them out of the EU is much better than a left wing authoritarian that sucks the EUs dick.

I don't like either of them. But by no definition should we be preferring Macron. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to sleep with you. No I don't mean have sex. I mean sleep. Together. Under a blanket. In your bed. While you're laying on my arm, with my other hand on your tummy. With the window cracked, so it's chilly and we have to cuddle closer. No talking, just the muffled cries that you slowly let seep away from your blood gurgling mouth as I slit your throat and sacrifice your worthless life to the dark overlord. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm Jewish as well. I honestly am still finding my place on the topic of Israel. I can see as a fact that it's very corrupt, but I also see sides such as the natural inclining for Christians to help Israel because it's known as the chosen people, as well as the fact that they have much lesser discriminatory standards of most of the middle East. The entire middle East is a very strange subject for me. There's problems riddled everywhere, and I can never pinpoint the blame on one individual or state. Israel is usually an outlier. Always in a strange position. I have absolutely no doubts about the Holocaust. My grandmother still lives in Israel, and I Skype with her every morning. She definitely loves the country, though old she may be she is in no way evil and if anything cropped up there I believe she would be vocal. That could also mean that the government is good at keeping their people out of the know, however.

I'm just a confused teenager on the topic, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask because it'll probably help me as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the first time I've ever told someone this.When I was about 10,I discovered something..something that I shouldn't found out. I was home alone and naked, watching TV on the couch.My cat Burger sat on my dick and started purring.It felt wrong but kinda good,this is also the first time ever I got a boner.Everyday when I got home from school Burger would sit on my dick while purring and while I give him head scratches,Burger would lick my cum.The sandpaper like feeling on my dick feels so good, I'm horny now typing this...

Next year I'll be moving out and a want to bring Burger with me.My parents would surely ask why because always act like I don't like him but secretly,I do VERY MUCH.There is also this feeling inside my gut that I need to tell my parents that I'm sexually attracted to cats.What should I do guys? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone goes on and on about Steve Bannon as this fucking racist and shit, but here's a couple points.

He never said he was a "white nationalist", he literally stated he was a normal nationalist, meaning patriot.

He was the only one close to Trump who was anti war. As soon as Bannon got out Syria strikes and MOAB came into place. Though many argue the MOAB never actually got Trump's approval.

Pisses me off how malleable Trump is but that's the only thing that had him doing well at first, and then the warmongering began.

As much as I don't like it, Bannon was a positive person in the administration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It isn't that Black and White 

1. This bill is repealing an FCC regulation that hasn't taken effect yet. We all have been and are living in the absence of this rule.


2. This is not repealing the underlying statute that was the basis for this rule, which provides for generalized privacy protection. In fact, part of the reasoning for this repeal is that it creates conflicting regulatory schemes between the FCC and FTC, which already has rules in effect, requiring ISPs to provide some privacy protection.


3. The point about cable companies "buying" this bill is highly misleading. All the cable companies make contributions to nearly every candidate. In fact, the three senators who received the most from Comcast all voted against this bill. They were democrats Bernie Sanders ($64,974), Michael Bennet ($49,825) and Patrick Leahy ($41,200). Given that Comcast somehow couldn't "buy" these votes, one would think the vote had nothing to do with contributions and was straight party line - probably because it's the repeal of a last-minute Obama regulation.


4. What's being repealed is not a simple "you can't sell privacy information" but a complex, potentially burdensome set of rules that could make it much harder to do business for the cable companies. I'm not advocating one way or another, and I'm certainly not feeling sorry for Comcast, but it's worth noting that if the regulatory costs increase, you can bet the price of internet service is going to rise, too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ontario (Listeni/ntrio/; French pronunciation: [tajo]), one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada.[7][8] It is Canada's most populous province[9] by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent[10] of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included.[1] It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.[11]

Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west, Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north, and Quebec to the east and northeast, and to the south by the U.S. states of (from west to east) Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. Almost all of Ontario's 2,700 km (1,678 mi) border with the United States follows inland waterways: from the west at Lake of the Woods, eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system. These are the Rainy River, the Pigeon River, Lake Superior, the St. Marys River, Lake Huron, the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, Lake Erie, the Niagara River, Lake Ontario and along the St. Lawrence River from Kingston, Ontario, to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall, Ontario. There is only about 1 km (0.6 mi) of land border made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border.[12]

Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions, Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario. The great majority of Ontario's population and arable land is located in the south. In contrast, the larger, northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and is heavily forested. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Milo is on the right side of the political spectrum, therefore he does not align with the economic policies of the alt right, as they tend to lean left even with their name.

Milo is a jew. Milo does not hate Jews. Milo isn't an anti semite.

Milo fucks black guys. Milo doesn't hate black people. Milo isn't a white supremecist.

There is nothing else to the alt right, he couldn't possibly be alt right by any standard.

<TEXT> It isn't that Black and White 

1. This bill is repealing an FCC regulation that hasn't taken effect yet. We all have been and are living in the absence of this rule.


2. This is not repealing the underlying statute that was the basis for this rule, which provides for generalized privacy protection. In fact, part of the reasoning for this repeal is that it creates conflicting regulatory schemes between the FCC and FTC, which already has rules in effect, requiring ISPs to provide some privacy protection.


3. The point about cable companies "buying" this bill is highly misleading. All the cable companies make contributions to nearly every candidate. In fact, the three senators who received the most from Comcast all voted against this bill. They were democrats Bernie Sanders ($64,974), Michael Bennet ($49,825) and Patrick Leahy ($41,200). Given that Comcast somehow couldn't "buy" these votes, one would think the vote had nothing to do with contributions and was straight party line - probably because it's the repeal of a last-minute Obama regulation.


4. What's being repealed is not a simple "you can't sell privacy information" but a complex, potentially burdensome set of rules that could make it much harder to do business for the cable companies. I'm not advocating one way or another, and I'm certainly not feeling sorry for Comcast, but it's worth noting that if the regulatory costs increase, you can bet the price of internet service is going to rise, too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It isn't that Black and White 

1. This bill is repealing an FCC regulation that hasn't taken effect yet. We all have been and are living in the absence of this rule.


2. This is not repealing the underlying statute that was the basis for this rule, which provides for generalized privacy protection. In fact, part of the reasoning for this repeal is that it creates conflicting regulatory schemes between the FCC and FTC, which already has rules in effect, requiring ISPs to provide some privacy protection.


3. The point about cable companies "buying" this bill is highly misleading. All the cable companies make contributions to nearly every candidate. In fact, the three senators who received the most from Comcast all voted against this bill. They were democrats Bernie Sanders ($64,974), Michael Bennet ($49,825) and Patrick Leahy ($41,200). Given that Comcast somehow couldn't "buy" these votes, one would think the vote had nothing to do with contributions and was straight party line - probably because it's the repeal of a last-minute Obama regulation.


4. What's being repealed is not a simple "you can't sell privacy information" but a complex, potentially burdensome set of rules that could make it much harder to do business for the cable companies. I'm not advocating one way or another, and I'm certainly not feeling sorry for Comcast, but it's worth noting that if the regulatory costs increase, you can bet the price of internet service is going to rise, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fan bearing is broken if im not mistaken. It's just loud. I wanted to replace the fan like many had suggested, but when i opened up the power supply I noticed the connector to the fan is glued on, White greyish looking thing that I couldnt possibly get rid of without breaking something or electrocuting myself. I can't afford to buy a new PSU, what do?

Also while im here, on the Phantom 410 case should the CS650M's fan be facing upwards or below? </TEXT>

<TEXT> a) Life expectancy: Oh I wonder why, maybe it's because we actually have the free will to do what we want with out lives instead of being forced into a healthier lifestyle even if we don't want it. This is a non-point.

b) Debt to GDP? You forgetting who did that? The 20 trillion debt was caused by a certain if-if-if-if-if'er. Also I find it really ironic that a socialist is worrying about the debt. Considering that the debt is the last thing a socialist would care about if in power.

c) Don't fucking talk to me about wealth inequality. Wealth inequality doesn't mean anything. 90% of americans live well above the standard of living in Europe. Complaining about wealth inequality just shows you don't know shit about economics.

c) Hmm if Bernie hated corrupt politicians so much I wonder why he threw his support at Hillary Clinton after she rigged the primaries against him   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you mean globalism, I'll tackle it.

#**Globalism**

-Easier transfer of the means of production

-Easy redistribution to people in poor condition areas

-Freer trade (Also possible in a nationalistic state)

-Easier competition

-Sharing technology with poorer countries/"areas"

-Easier and more open to see and learn about others nations

#**Anti-Globalism** ^^^nationalism

-Poor countries have an easier playing field with the rest of the world

-Loss of culture and pride

-Corruption is inevitable. (Ie: EU)

-Slave trade

-Stale economy growth

-Abuse of power from elites controlling the planet

-50/50 chance of direct democracy, or corrupt politicians in power, neither of which is generally good for a state

-Jobs from hard working families taken for slaves in poorer areas

-Some cultures are not compatible, and extremes of both sides will cause violence to each other

<TEXT> I'm not a christian, but I don't think it's fair to put christianity on the same level as other religions on homophobia. The old testament has plenty of gay hate, but the whole point of christianity is the rejectment of the old testaments ideals and the acceptance of the new testament. Iirc the new testament only ever mentioned homosexuality once, and all it said was that it's wrong. Not that you should punish them or attack them.

<TEXT> AD 635: Christian Damascus falls to invading Muslims. 

AD 636: Christian Antioch falls to invading Muslims. 

AD 638: Christian (controlled) Jerusalem falls to invading Muslims, Alexandria falls the same year. 

AD 650: Muslim armies reach Cilicia and Caesarea. In the preceding years multiple raids were carried out by Muslim forces in Cyprus, Rhodes, Crete, and Sicily resulting in thousands of Christians being killed or captured as slaves. 

AD 668: Muslim forces lay siege to Constantinople, they were defeated. 

AD 711: Muslim forces invade Spain, by 715 most of Spain is under Muslim control. 

AD 717: Muslim forces again lay siege to Constantinople, and are again defeated. 

AD 732: Muslim forces invade France, are repulsed at Tours. 

AD 792: Muslim leader of Spain calls for new invasion of France, multinational Jihad is declared and repulsed by France. 

AD 827: Muslim forces invade Italy. 

AD 846: Muslim forces reach Rome, force Pope to pay them tribute. 

AD 848: France again invaded by Muslims, Muslims again repulsed. 

Constant raids go on after this, no major seizure of land. 

AD 1095: Pope Urban II launches the FIRST crusade.

The crusades aren't a very good example.

Problem isn't when someone privately practices their religion, it's when they do something about it publically. There are 1.2 Billion Muslims and nearly 20% can be considered radical. That's a scary number. That's why you need extreme vetting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure bullying goes into it, but considering 85% of millenials consider themselves liberal I seriously doubt that. Conservatives don't want to discriminate against LGBT. However your only increasing discrimination with these bogus laws and sayings. Treat each other like people, but when  you force someone to speak a certain way that only makes them dislike you more.

Depression is a mental disorder. Anxiety is a mental disorder. Transgenderism is a mental disorder, but that doesn't mean we want to discriminate against the people who hold those labels. </TEXT>

It worked fine before, but I'm pretty sure it was a system restore that now whenever i turn off my second monitor it disconnects and all my rainmeter items move to the first monitor and i have to put them back manually every time i turn on my monitors. So I found out that I don't have intel graphics driver installed so I went to install that and found out that the setup crashes my system. What do??? </TEXT>

It starts up, and then after doing the small configuration im put at an android is starting thing. I can access quick settings and click on recents.

Its been doing this for twenty minutes. Is it because i didnt install google now launcher or pixel launcher from gapps, so it doesnt have a launcher? or is it supposed to take this long or do this AFTER setup? (ie:fingerprint, wifi, etc) </TEXT>

This is without my GPU fan, which is quiet af, I'm about to open up the pc and take some pictures and stuff. My motherboard is a Gigabyte Z170M D3H so it doesnt have any decent fan control. Any tips? Any tricks? What am I doing wrong? I got this fan a couple months ago, but I just cleaned it out with some compressed air and it didnt do anything.

I'll edit with photos/video of inside the case

This is 100% true, however, doing an investigation is not to satisfy them, it's to save any innocent child that may or may not be caught in this situation. If someone wants to believe something they can, but the true goal is justice. And we can't have justice if we ignore the call.

I'm just as much of a skeptic, but this isn't a normal conspiracy theory.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When talking about President Dwight Eisenhower's administration, Sanders said, "I think the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent."

CNBC's John Harwood then said, "It was 90. When you think about 90 percent, you don't think that's obviously too high."

Sanders replied, "No. What I think we've seen, and what frightens me again, when you have the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Does anybody think that that is the kind of economy this country should have? Do we think it's moral?"

If you wanna screw these people so badly with Bernie's 90% taxing rate, these people then won't be able to hire anybody to spread the wealth they have. 

Believe me, I don't like either, but Bernie is also part of the 1%. You're point doesn't prove anything. </TEXT>

<TITLE> For those with Snapchat lag </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-10 05:40:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I saw a bunch of posts recently about this, so I hope this helps if you need it.

Here's how I fixed Snapchat lag.

Download GLTools, paid on the play store or APK.

Open GLTools and search for Snapchat.

Apply these changes to the settings of Snapchat in GLTools;

- Enable custom settings for this app - On

- Force 16 bit rendering - On (If you encounter a black screen, turn this back off)

- Optimize GLSL shaders - On

- Enable texture decompression - Disable

- Enable texture recompression - Disable

- Downscale textures - Limit to 256x256 (If pictures or text become pixelated, change this to Disable)

- (If available) Lower resolution EGL hack - On

- (If available) Lower resolution GL hack - On 

Restart Snapchat

Props to r/Android for figuring this trick out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had nothing but bullshit with Nvidia's drivers ever since I bought a 1070. First Novideo card, nice performance. Drivers give me fucking aids to use. Inconsistent. Constant crashing. And I've DDUd many times, and fresh windows installs. Fuck Nvidia's drivers. The only issue with my old 280 was very rare overwatch crashes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Liberals running Canada are making really fucking dumb decisions and ruining our economy further

Trumps stance on NATO has me worried about Ukraine

EXTREME threats to free speech with Bills such as C-16 in Canada

Unusually large number of celebrity deaths 

The pay-to-play discoverances about Justin Trudeau

Canada is letting in 50k Syrian refugees into Ontario ALONE. This is way too many refugees, a couple thousand would be fine, but this is far too much.

<TEXT> I used Resurrection Remix on my LG G3 for months. It was pretty great, aside from being a little unstable. Now that I have my Nexus 6P, I went to PureNexus Marshmallow until 7.1.1 came out, then transferred to Cortex ROM.

So my question is, how stable is RR 7.1.1 for the Nexus 6P? Is battery life above or below average? Does it use CMTE or Substratum? Who is the best maintainer for the 6P? Does it work fine with ElementalX? </TEXT>

GTA 5 is completely different on PC than on the 360. It's an entirely different port and had to be developed as a different game entirely.

And even if it was the exact same, your point is still invalid now. "Doubling performance for a 3.5 year old game doesn't matter" Yeah no, GTA 5 is still the third most played game on steam. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been hearing a lot of positivity about it lately, I'm running Cortex 7.1.1 with ElementalX and I have insane battery issues here. An hour of SOT and my battery is at 65%. My screen only having took 6% of my battery.

I've been looking to switch to Nitrogen and I've been wondering what you guys' experiences are? What's your battery life like? SoT? Usage? What kernel are you using and what's scrolling performance like?

Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> See, now this is an opportunity for me to simply reply "No its not." and follow the context of the posted image. I could easily expect a few upvotes for this, as it is simple ironic humor. But I will not suffer such temptation. Though you may offer me a beginning with your "me", allowing to follow through and perhaps a third member to finish our trifecta of bland, internet comedy with an "it is" comment, I will resist. I am greater than this and will not give in to losing myself in the sea of insignificant thoughts in hopes of inspiring a flash of joy in some other who may reply to the most minor surges of endorphins with a click and an increase in pointless comment karma.

I wonder what the follow up to my revelation here will be? Will my monologue be lost forever in obscurity, never to be read by more than the one I am replying to, or will the oddity of my rant bring more eyes to it? I do not relish in the thought of either event, though I am fearful of the absence of both. Perhaps someone will reply to my statement here. In my heart, I would hope for some deeper comment, but I know my place and those who surround me. A basic "me too thanks" will further fuel the pyre of ironic humor established here, rendering my words insignificant and setting them on the path of annihilation. 

This world is both beautiful and terrible. I wonder which way this road will go today. </TEXT>

My story begins from when I was a little girl. An innocent child at the hands of a cruel grandfather. About twice a year my family would fly out to where my grandparents lived. Thats how my young life started, being violently raped and abused over and over again. And thats how the sexual abuse continued throughout my entire childhood. Also, you're gay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Overwatch has kill streaks in the form of ultimates. You will barely get a fully charged ult without getting a couple kills. 

Also Titanfall 2 is just straight up a fucking great and fun game. 

It's $30, give it a try. If you don't like it, origin support will be happy to refund you  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recently switched from a LG G3 to the 6P. On my G3 I had the CM13 theme called dark red/pitch black. I'm running pure nexus which uses the Substratum theme engine. It looked like CommuteUI had a nice black theme embedded, however it costs money and I don't have enough play credit. I opted for InversionUI but some notification text isn't legible, the color is green and I would have preferred red, and it isn't pure black, more a dark gray. As well as it didn't theme my Instagram like Dark red did. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

When dan turned around to try and punch and break his nose like when he was younger...the man was met with a rough,lust filled kiss and as it went on...dan fell for it and kissed the man (man) back. Erik pulls him up and throws him onto the bed and rips dans pants off and his own to ram into dan....time skip to after....they both laid panting and dan was filled like a donut and just as he was going to say something....Erik pants out"no homo" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I could not sleep in last 4 nights since noticing  u have sold the house while I was trying to find the money. to keep it My wish is to have a bird nest where u and Andrew can live whenever needed and ur mom could stay. But u chose to sell it ignoring my plead to ask u to wait for me for 2 Wks. U rush into selling while similar house on Cook in a bad shape were sold when asking $900,000 After ur mom' s death I were thinking of moving in to cover all expenses so u and Andrew can live without worrying but ur attitude had put me back . In order to be able to stay with u and Andrew I had been living unhappy life for 24 yrs and U can't just wait for me for 2 wks .I love u two quietly unlike others who likes to speak out. Even though I live apart fr u two for the last 7 yrs I am working hard to try to save something for u and Andrew but U and Andrew now think of being matured enough to be on ur own,u may think my advice is nonsense but just wait until u need to support a family of 4 . Life is not easy , making money is tough saving money is even tougher . I hope u would use the money to invest instead of spending it unwisely or u will be regret , remember only money can make money , don't rely on ur working income to live comfortably, I used to make average of $180,000 /year but after taxes and all expenses, I could only saved $160,000 ,without any vacation ,for the down payment toward buying that house, 8 yrs ago ur mom secretly took out $50,000 loan because it was under her name and now u sold the house without consulting me.With proof of down payment and all monthly expenses,I thought of court action against her when I were lock out of the house but then I promised to myself not to take action as long as u two stay in that housebut then to make $100,000 is not hard but to save that much money it may require u to work for ur whole life,I wonder what I have done wrong . During the 2 wks in and out of hospital for treatment of a scar in my lung ,I worried  of what u guys had for meals, how u cope with life without ur mom ,but I was in big shock to be told that u were in Europe, Andrew was in Kingston ,ignoring my calls ,the house was put up for sale, it really hurts me.I never expect to have such ending in my life sometimes people just simply speak to gain love without predicting the consequences. 
God knows!!! U may not hear me lecturing again.
All my hope is to see u and live a happy and prosperous life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reddit has truly become quite lazy in nature. One worded posts are truly quite a disgrace. I'm sure for you, you just see it as easy karma - you come on every week or so and just think about how to contribute in the laziest way possible. I hate how in reddit it seems that some of the laziest, shortest comments seem to get upvoted and I truly believe it is a disgrace and shows that we are in darker days as a website. We almost lost ourself during the Pao debacle, we almost lost ourselves before that but Reddit just continues to grow stronger. I'm starting to believe it's just similar to facebook - too big to fall. </TEXT>

I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Halloween Mercy pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Blizzard create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not a terrible kid academically, my marks are usually in the higher 70s right now. I'm a sophomore in high school, and I usually head to bed at like 11, but I usually browse reddit on my phone, and by the time I decide to go to actually sleep it's usually 1-3AM. 

I frequently lose focus in my first three periods because I'm tired. I also find myself struggling to understand things that I know my brain is perfectly capable of understanding thoroughly. I guess my brain is using the excuse that Grade 10 marks don't matter, and that would be right. Grade 11 and Grade 12 are what's important, but if I keep the sleep pattern as it is now, it won't be easy to switch. 

Theres no reasoning with me when I'm tired, so help? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't relevant for me just yet... I've still got about three years till I head off to college. BUT, I've been wondering about a certain thing. Is it possible to get a laptop that can dual boot windows and OSX without spending a fortune on an actual Mac? 

It would be nice, in class OSX would seemingly be more useful, since I don't have anything to distract me and a clean sleek work efficient process. Once I'm done studying I could boot into windows and do whatever I would like to there. How realistic is this? Can it be done? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now first off, I'm not diagnosed with ADHD. However getting diagnosed would be too expensive where I live. I've just been wondering if this one specific trait I have could be related to it, and some other questions. 

a) I'm addicted to my phones battery life. Every time I use my phone my eyes just stay on the battery percentage and just stare. If I'm browsing reddit I end up looking at my battery every ten seconds, and I constantly worry about it. If my phones at 99% I will work my ass off to make it 100%. Constant pinging in my mind of what could be wrong and how to improve it. Could this be related to an ADD/ADHD? 

b) What is the difference between ADD and ADHD? 

c) I can't watch movies or shows. I lose focus way too fast and struggle to stay in my seat without occupying myself with something else. Is this a trait? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find any chest size a good size, though a little something is nice.
My last partner was incredibly flat, and they kind of felt bad for me, because as I said before, I prefer a little something.
During the first time we had sex, they were super sensitive about everything. So I told them to take it easy. They wanted to try to give me a paizuri (breast job, for those people who still have their dignity). Ever received a paizuri from a person that's flat as a chess board?
Put human skin on a xylophone then run your dick on it, you'll feel the same experience.
Anyway, I told them I wasn't really feeling it, and they were sad about it, then I felt bad about it. I just told them to use their mouth and it'll be fine.
Later, they tell me:
"Don't worry Shaku! If I'm anything like my mom, I'll start to grow boobs once I hit 12 years old!"
Then I just laughed at them. I told them this:
"Haha! That's not gonna happen. Boys don't develop breast like girls do." </TEXT>

What if a woman have cancer and she have about just a few months to live? I'm just saying. Oh and I support feminism cause hey, suppressed women exists too okay.

<TEXT> This portable power bank I've been looking at, 

http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B010L43UAQ/

Has a review that's worrying me. Cherry picked 

The input charging rate for this is 2A (actually, I got 1.94A - close enough). And if you are trying to charge with any lesser USB power source (like a laughable 900mA, or 0.9A) or a typical USB Data Synch/Charging cable, which inherently has amperage limits due to the data transfer capability, you **WILL** have problems.

What does this mean for me? I have the standard charging cable. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was at a clothing store with my mother today. I was browsing the shirts in the big and tall section while slowly sipping my Diet Mountain Dew looking for the ever elusive 5XL shirt. When passing by the rack full of shirts too small for any average man such as myself to wear when out of the corner of my Gunnar glasses I saw a shelf full of head-wear that peaked my interest. I approached the shelf wiping the leftover Dorito dust from my all night long Overwatch marathon onto my 6th #FeelTheBern shirt when I saw it. The perfect hat to adorn my head, the one piece of fabric that could define my personality while also covering that embarrassing shine poking through right above my hair-tie.

[This hat](http://i.imgur.com/xQ8fnW1.jpg) felt perfect for me, and the moment that I put it on I could tell, this was the hat for me, the hat that I could never take off and would complete my entire aura of high fashion. Within the first 69 seconds of looking at m'self in the mirror I noticed a fine lady was looking at me from the other side of the store, smiling with the biggest grin I have ever seen. The smile was akin only to those I have only seen on Jennifer Lawrence's perfect face on television while laughing and flirting with Thor's ugly younger brother. It was unmistakable, this woman was flirting with me, the way she shook her breasts up and down while smiling and trying to cover it up like she was shy or embarrassed about it. I tipped m'fedora in her direction and she swooned so hard she fell right to the ground, her grin still visible from ear to ear. [This hat...](http://i.imgur.com/xQ8fnW1.jpg) had turned me into a total pussy slayer, buffing m'romance skill by a value of 1337. 

Then m'mom came back, took m'newly found superpower off m'head and she told me to "Stop acting like a fucking neckbeard" and dragged me out by the scruff beneath m'chin that I have not had time to attend to since I got m'GTX 1080 and m'copy of Overwatch. She drove me back home and instantly locked me in my room with some new clothes she picked out and a treadmill. "I'll let you out when you can wear normal sized clothes and interact with people in a way that doesn't make them laugh at you for being a dumbass."

M'mother hates me now all because I instantly became a woman's wet dream. She won't let me go near a hat again, not even m'blue "Make Donald Drumpf Again" hat with an MLG sticker on the back. M'mom has ruined m'chances with the ladies forever and only unlocks and opens the door to m'room to give me a kale salad. How can m'mother do this to me, is there anything I can do to resolve this quarrel to continue m'main quest in the fall. I guess m'mother couldn't cope with the fact that in university this fall I would meet a beautiful blonde with luscious DD cup breasts who would love me for the nice guy I am on the inside, and marry me for m'above average brain and m'degree in Animation with a minor in Japanese Culture.

The treadmill broke when I started to hang m'sweat drenched T-shirts on it after intense matches of CS:GO in 4K so I don't know how I will lose enough weight to even leave m'bedroom now. Guess I will have to find a good online university to study for m'degree and guess I should upload a picture of one of those ugly guys all the hawt ladies seem to go crazy over to m'Tinder profile so I can acheive the life I was planning on while trapped here in m'parents' basement. Any advice for what else I should do? Maybe I should photoshop [this hat](http://i.imgur.com/xQ8fnW1.jpg) with m'LEET hacker skillz on top of the ugly guy's head so even more ladies will swipe right.

Sorry this was long, but thanks for hearing me out in m'moment of anger and fine ladies that I have seen in the selfie threads, feel free to hit me up in m'DMs.

That's a pic the cooler

https://youtu.be/6YpYEUOgftU

That's the rattling it makes. 


I'm confused, this started the other day while I was playing GTA V and it wasnt very noticeable. Putting my fan speed at 100% with speed fan and running a CPU stress test won't make this noise, but when gaming it's unbearable, and has also hurt my temperatures. I got my cooler a month ago, and has been working flawlessly since. I haven't opened my PC in Atleast a week before it started happening, and I'm too scared to turn my PC on right now cuz I'd rather not have a roasted CPU. 

My mobo is a GA78LMT-USB3 and my CPU is a FX 8320 4.2Ghz

Help of any kind would be great

Edit: one of the fans clips went connected to the heatsink. I'm testing it right now, I'll update

It clearly works on different binaural audio plays on YouTube, you can simply have an engine that interprets the audio as a human ear would, and have a left cup for your left ear and a right cup for your right ear. This would make games like CSGO so much more enjoyable, and for single player experiences it can make for an amazing experience! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Find your proper audio drivers. I know, sounds useless, right? Worked for me. And worked for three friends I suggested the fix for. 

First off, if you have a sound card, you should get the cards drivers. Except Asus Xonar, avoid the stock drivers with a 10 foot pool and get the UNi Modded Drivers. 

If you do not, go to your motherboards page on the manufacturing website and download the audio driver, then restart your computer. 

I hope this helps! It fixed my crashing, but it supposedly fixed many friends extreme stuttering! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my math teacher isn't very good. I could explain how she doesn't explain well and everything but everyone knows what that's like. The real problem is the grades. The class average is 62% so that proves that. My first report card I got a 74%. Now I wasn't very happy with that (obviously) so I tried my hardest to improve. Since then we have done 2 tests and a quiz. The tests I have achieved 93% and 81% respectively. The quiz was about 70%. One kid asked for her to show us her updated marks after the stated assessments, and my mark has dropped down to 71%?? This confuses me and is hurting my head. How could this be possible. I finish all my homework and quite frankly should not have had my mark drop. This is grade 9 math if it matters and yes I understand grade 9 grades don't really matter but they do to me. </TEXT>
