<TEXT> Can we all agree NOT being racist does not mean your are Conservative or Liberal. You can be Liberal and still racist.
I'm liberal and not racist and I know many conservative people who are also NOT racist. But a racist is just that a racist, it just to happens a lot of racists are also conservative but that is because a certain political party playcates to that since it gets them votes.

Like you can evangelical christian republicans who are against drilling for oil and are environmentalists and believe jesus and god demand we are stewards of the environment. They are still republican and "Conservative" but they don't go DRILL BABY DRILL.

Not to mention Devin also went to several meetings with Flynn to talk with Turkish government reps to extradite a united states citizen illegally without due process to a dictator at stage 2 of demolishment of Turkish Democracy. But hey whatever ... who cares about due process and constitutional rights? Oh that right NOT TRUMP!!!!

<TEXT>  The Last Supper

Reading the synopsis it sounds like Ron Perlman's character would be a Rush Limbaugh type and have no sense for the fine line between Individual Freedoms and Autocratic power. His Character sounds like Donald Trump. 

Which is hilariously the exact opposite. Maybe when I said Authoritarian and Libertarian its the difference between where the separation of the individual vs the state begins. Knowing the fine line for self autonomy while also giving yourself part to the society you live in and following under a set of rules / laws that allow for freedoms with moderation as well as strong protections for the consumer/ citizen to prevent harm from unfettered profit over conservation in community stewardship in capitalism. 

I was a fan of Both Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt in their stances and policies to corporations, citizens rights. But in modern times I think Carter was my favorite, next to Obama. No one is perfect and Teddy and FDR had serious faults in relation to race issues. Carter was railroaded and Reagan getting rid of the solar panels on the white house and killing the solar panel subsidy was the same level of petty bullshit as the republicans have been trying to do for the last 8 years for the Affordable Care Act.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so there are TWO types of HDR video. There is HDR10 and Dolby Vision. HDR10 can be handled by software and is an open standard while Dolby Vision (proprietary format) requires, up until recently, a special chip. Dolby though has said they should be able to shoe horn it into some older tvs though with a new software version they developed. But here is the rub, HDR10 and Dolby Vision media is not guaranteed to play on every tv in HDR color.

https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2017/04/brace-yourselves-the-hdr-format-war-is-coming/


First you need a 10-bit color display with 4k support. Then you need HDCP 2.0 compliant encryption media devices all the way through the chain. So if your Receiver has 4k passthrough but no HDCP 2.0 then you get no HDR playback or even 4k playback with external boxes.

For streaming, Netflix and Amazon currently support both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. Oddly enough, VUDU only supports Dolby Vision and wont provide HDR10 content.

If you get a player your UHD disks might not provide HDR video depending on what is on the disk and what software is on the player.

And it looks like Samsung has to fuck the pot and come out with yet another FORMat of HDR called HDR10+

Qui Qui! Pardon mon franais, je suis amricain, mais un monde ouvert est celui de la croissance, de l'apprentissage et du partage des connaissances. Le nationalisme et l'isolationnisme ne font que tuer l'innovation positive positive, la croissance culturelle mondiale positive et la dcouverte mutuelle des vrits universelles de la connaissance

Universal Political Centristism sans austrit, mais l'quilibre est la seule faon de dvelopper n'importe quoi. Politique avec une protection forte pour la sant des citoyens, l'accs  l'ducation publique sculaire, l'accs  une formation gratuite pour des emplois qualifis de travail qualifi, comme tant un plombier ou un lectricien, l'accs  l'enseignement suprieur gratuit et la protection du consommateur et l'autodtermination individuelle sur son propre corps pour les hommes Et les femmes sont ce qui fait une socit productive et heureuse, nous l'avons vu  maintes reprises.

In english:

healthy politics must be seen as riding the razor's edge of both Communist and Capitalist, Authoritarian and Libertarian, it must be centrist to get the best mixture of all to best serve the people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wikileaks was never "Useful" what Edward snowden did by going to trusted news journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill from the The Guardian and The Washington Post  and Poitras was a progressive liberal documentarian was how you do this. 

I have met Assange twice and the first time he got rapey at a hacker con where a security head of the con had to come and punch him out because he wouldn't stop and take no as a response from my drunk female hacker friend. 

The second time was just after wikileaks manifesto was released at another hacker con and his cult status started to grow. Assange is an egotist and he runs Wikileaks like his own personal cabal where he can dictate his views of the world to others who blindly follow or quickly removed or gas lighted or goaded into doing what he wants or he cuts you off from the group. He is a man who is an egocentric victim complex who has always let it known he hates aggressive women, he openly mocks verbal vocal women at hacker cons in the past and is pretty much a walking poster for /r/TheRedPill after his persecution for the rape of two women by not having sex with a condom and lying about it to them. 

The point is he used that to fuel his conspiracy tinfoil hat wearer mystique who hate uppity women type. He hated clinton since the 90s if you read his earlier rantings before wikileaks for whatever reason. And he is a man who like Peter Thiel thinks there is nothing wrong with having slaves or having a slave caste and that "racism is over", coming from an albino looking james bond villain henchman  looking punk ass motherfucker like him I find that hilarious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have noticed that a lot of highly questionable age of model images are getting posted to reddit that might be child porn. An example of this would be stuff posted on /r/RealGirls which makes it to /r/all a lot. 

Can we get a universal Child porn report button please that supersedes the mods of individual sub reddits and goes straight to all the top admins? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the united states they would charge you 1500 to 3000 for the ultrasound, 150 to 1000 for the cortisone shot, and like 500 to 750 for the doctor visit (USD) and you wait up to 10 hours in the ER as well or got to Urgent Care which is cheaper less life threatening doctor needs but does not have Radiology or ultrasound imaging equipment and only open typically during normal 9 to 5 biz hours and wait 2 to 3 hours to see a doctor and be told can't do much else, here have a script for some drugs and a bill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can get free healthcare from the state or you can pay for the private sector in order to not have to wait in the terrible lines.

I don't know what anyone is talking about. I wait longer to see the doctor in the united states than when I have gone to the ER / Doctors in Europe. I have been to the doctors in the London, Dublin, Munich, and Amsterdam. Wait times were nothing compared to the 2 hour wait for some of my GM doctors visits and the ER / Urgent Care visit took me significantly less time than the USA. In the USA even with a car accident and laceration i took 7 hours for a doctor to see me and even then it took 2 hours to get taken to the back area in the first place so from start to finish it took 12 hours for an ER visit and I asked them and where I live that was a SLOW day too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Freedom Caucus (Blackhearted Extreme Religious Social Darwinist Republicans) wanted to make people who were at risk be in pools that made them pay more and remove all the taxes to pay for subsidies. They voted No on AHCA 1st go because the bill didn't gut the support enough and didn't make people suffer enough. They voted Yes this time around because they now took out the requirement for pre-existing conditions for any state exchanges to exempt out that requirement if it has a governor say, "I want chronic sick people to suffer more"  And they also will be gutting medicare support which allowed children to be covered if they were poor and as well as poor people who couldn't get any healthcare any other way because they are poor or have pre-existing conditions, Like Me.

<TEXT> For me America has always represented a land that is sposed to be a mix of people and cultures. When some dumb ass says no it's a white nation i laugh my ass off at their stupidness. Because catholic Irish leaving the famine were not white we were hella looked at like less than white. But that is where Irish and catholics and italians, and polish played into the racist game and sold out on Asians and Blacks to just feel slightly better than them. 

Irish people would make sure they screwed black people harder culturally because if you looks at the black guy the irish catholic might finally be able to get a job. There is some fucked up history of irish particularly in america, early on as indentured servants and then later on after the famine as they came the the USA. 

But anyway The united states is one of the few countries where you can get away at mocking the leader and not have to worry about getting disappeared or sued. Its one of the national prides i have but i wouldn't say it gives me nationalism. 

Nationalism, i think you are using it poorly. Nationalism is illogical devotion to one's country, it borders on jingoism which is rabid illogical devotion to one's country. Patriotism is a better word ...

<TEXT> Actually that is very common thing. You remove the extra pixels for color your image will become sharper as the fact it only has to process the gradients of greyscale. Color can give you depth but black and white gives you sharpness. This is why you use black   white and negative images in digital image analysis to find where things look funny.

<TEXT> Yup my moobs have been on the internets. We were out at a Maryland area hackerspace and had been drinking beer and liquor from noon to 7 when that photo was taken. We also had a hell of a foodie cook out / pot luck as well. Also a video of a fire tornado the hacker space made made several local news clips and the discovery channel as well. It was hella fun for all. We had lock picking tutorials, a 12 foot wide 3 foot deep inflatable pool as well

The stalker guys though who harassed my friends afterwards were what made it a sad thing though. The picture wasnt supposed to be posted but one punk did. I banned him since he kept posting it all over the place then he got a gaggle of his college friends from RIT to move a movement to have me removed so i was and i quit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> speed megabit, data megabyte. We typically messure in megabit because thats 1 or 0. On off. light on light off, 5 volts / no volts. But we can also measure speed in megabytes which means if it it was 80 MB (megabyte) its actually 80 time 8 bits to make it 640 Megabits per second for the max steam download for games i have seen.

Video file video quality though is measured in megabits per second and a 4k HDR netflix video stream is 25 megabits per second but with their new video encoder tech they are able to make H.265 HVEC video in 4k HDR go as low as 5mbps when there is no action on the screen. 

To put that into context a UHD Bluray uses 28 to 50 mbps for H.265 video 

also my torrents typically only go 1.2 to 5 megabits per second but i throttle though typically to have it only go max 1mbps upload and 2mbps download with 6 downloads at a time and 30 uploads at a time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I take it you have never been to the "Third world" have you? Also It's not called the third world you dumb ass. It's called the "Developing World".

Third World / Second World / First World comes from the Cold War era as a way to define countries that remained non-aligned with either NATO (first world), the Communist Bloc (second world), or unaffiliated (third world).

<TEXT> No SUV and Vans are entirely different base frames and are very different undercarriage body structure.

Now some SUVs have used Van / truck frames when they first came out but since then to deal with tip over and other issues the frames have dramatically changed.

The reason I want a mini van is I want to be able to take out the seats and have that flat easy to use storage space if I need it. Like an Astro Van.

Vans have flat floors remember, not a body frame that supports the seats up higher and then have dips for the feet. Van Seats are designed to have the raiser built into it so its about 8 inches to 10 inches off the ground with storage underneath if it is a bench or rotation if it is a single seat  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It wasn't nihilism you tit. Simulacra and Simulation by Jean Baudrillard was empty and hallowed out when it was shown in the movie. The movie is in essence a trans-humanism / Existentialist hero journey. Neo is faced with the fact the One is just another means of control. But he says "fuck that there has to be a way to change it" He chooses to persist because he "chooses to" and does so for altruistic intentions. That is the very cornerstone of Existentialism. You CHOOSE to go on and find meaning in your life, its a glass half full look at life. 

SMITH, the villain of the story is the nihilist, he wants to be free and freedom to him means death. He hates his life so much that he will destroy everyone and everything around him to bring it all crashing down. He will swallow everyone up becoming the Superman in the ultimate climax for the purpose of destruction and  to bring about the black void of oblivion. No matter what the glass is always half empty for him because he is forced to be alive.

Ultimately through destruction and Neo under the right circumstances allows Smith to think he has given up. Smith thinks he won but Neo did the ultimate Autherian / Messianic sacrifice to fulfill a deal with the machines to save the machines and in turn save the humans, not just in the idea of human genetics or as a concept of the species living on but the for the right for human's to have to self determination of their future and have the machine system of controls removed. 

Again any Nihilistic texts referenced in the movie are shown as hollow and the villains being all Nihilists and hedonists are shown to be hallow and hate their own lives so much they live off the emotions and lives of others. Cipher was a nihilist who wanted opulence and to forget again. The Merovingian and his hoards of Vampires, Werewolves, and Ghosts. Also the very fact the Merovingian is displayed as a typical 1% rich asshole is very telling while the heroes are all hackers who build things from parts and trash and are using old outdated equipment to get by.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Empty gestures would be hollow gesture. The point the people who use "Virtue Signaling" created it as the counter to "Dog Whistle".

The only people who use Virtue Signaling are ones who oppose typically things like diversity, affirmative action, gender identity issues, gender equality, racial equality, and issues of class / income inequality.

"Dog Whistle" means coded political language which always has racist or bigot undertones to policies.

Like if i said seeing movie about black female engineers makes me cry with joy because of the fact being a engineer it makes me happy to see zeitgeist popular culture have realistic depictions of not just female engineers, but of black american engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists i get said oh that's just liberal Virtue Signaling. I fucking hate that shit because it just makes it seem like nothing you do is of value unless the the alt-right racist brigade supports its. 

And the only people who say things are empty are the ones who oppose it or are so gods damn bitter and cynical that the world is always shit and can never get any better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Um so ... if you are doing a job that a normal developer does you should get paid. It's against the law not to pay you. 

The following **six standards must ALL be met in order to establish that an intern qualifies to work unpaid**: 

1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar training which would be given in an educational environment; 

2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern; 

3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff; 

4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded; 

5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and 

6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.

Seriously though both are going to make you a slave for low pay. Go with Blizzard because you can get some free gamer shit and go to E3 or other game dev conf as industry or get them to pay for you.

With the splintering of the Dixiecrats this is where the modern Democratic party that was anti-KKK and pro civil rights came from. Basically all the racist bigots jumped ship and went to the republicans. You then had the start of the merger of Republican Politics post Goldwater who was very much against religious merger in politics and after that you had the rise of William F Buckley modern conservatism which merged christian protestant evangelicalism from Billy Graham but more so Jerry Falwell who created the moral majority, which evolved then into the christian right with the GOP and Ronald Reagan  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So are we talking nationalism or national pride because I feel the ball is being moved and the goal posts are also being moved from your argument. 

You can have community pride. I mean I'm from maryland so any time they are in then news for something good like banning fracking i'm proud. But nationalism is a whole other thing. Nationalism is unflinching. National Pride is something that means you can also feel national shame. Nationalism means you never see any shades of black to the star spangle awesome of your special choosen nation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who voted to sell off internet privacy? I disnt see a single Democrat on that list. The issue as a whole though is democrats work as not one unified party but as a coalition which on a whole are fractured and have a mix of people. Some are liberal in the economic vein where helping Buissness helps people. But most are put your money where your mouth is and never takes private company's word as honest unless part of the deal brings something fo constituents. You can see it all the time and the false equivalency you believe in is the entire game plan of the republican party for the last 30 years. Ever since newt Gingrich wqs speaker of the house the skrink the government at all cost shut down the government if we dont get our way slash and burn and salt the earth make everyone hate all politicians and do as little work as possible has been game plan of the GOP. </TEXT>

They only live in a country because it has some sort of stability, laws favor them, they love playing with the chess peices like they own them, or they are dumb and wont be rich for long.

When it comes down to it im a middle class citizen who demands universal education for everyone. Universal basic income for every person of legal working age. With it kept in the trust till 18th birthday for youth. And im for universal access to information/ internet. I am against trademarks, patents, and even copyright unless directly owned and used by its creator for a peirod of 10 years after publication with a court having to allow extensionss for only copyright until 20 years after creation. 

Even then fair use should be something the copyright owner has to fight to prove false. All copyright and trademark cases should be paid through a fund of lawyers that is established by taking a percentage of the profits from copyrighted work

They are not globalists but international abusers of the poor and powerless who like the united sates for the last 150 years bent over backwards to please them. The fact is private companies have too much power and run politics for the sale of making quarterly profit numbers. A presidential election like trump was cheap to keep they richest rich and the rabel fighting amongst themselves. Typically democrats will try to make something comeout of the tree shake to help the working class. Republicans shake the tree and direct what falls out to their friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> fascism is a ultra right wing jingoistic political ideology that blames the problems of the state of mythical foreigners as scapegoats while shrinking the services and size of the government but then giving control of government services over to tightly controlled private companies with owners being friends or members of the ruling party.

The origin and symbol of Fascism comes from the usage of a Fascis ( or a bundle of sticks) that was uses to beat people by the Fasci, or special roman soldiers, in modern era roman empire, to get them out of the way of ruling senatorial class as they made their way through the city. </TEXT>

<TEXT> technically it is our biz since it would be considered behavior unbecoming of an officer. Also he was getting paid for another job while he was a commissioned officer meaning he didn't get permission beforehand which is a violation as well for the sake of trust since it might mean he is taking payments for an organization that has financial ties or special choice for military contracts And you need permission first because they need to vet that factor from any side work enlisted active officers do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> here is the really fucked up part. Your salary isn't even matched to inflation. If it was you would be earning closer to $15 an hour. In cities it would be closer to $20 an hour since large metro cities usually pay higher salary than the minimum wage because of the cost of living. Put that into context to your wife's pay then as well. Its estimated that the average american is making 15% less than they would have in equal dollars 30 years ago because of the fact we have allowed minimum wage to stagnate and not match inflation as the bottom level payment  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Subversive art helps galvanize people. Sculpture, paintings, Graphic design, illustrations, and literature are all ART.

To say no one was affected by Political Cartoons, Plays, Art, means you have no idea what the heck you are talking about. Subversive art allows people to see a contextualized view of resistance and open defiance that rallies them. 

From the American Revolution to modern times Subversive art actually has created rallying around moments. Join or Die political cartoon, drawn by Benjamin Franklin and first published in his Pennsylvania Gazette on May 9, 1754 is an example as well as classical traditional art that shows non-royalty or nobleman being tradesmen / craftsmen.

We could also go into litterature if you want. But the fact is political art has major waves of creating a zeitgeist of public resistance in a country or nation. It is at it's core ... memetic warfare before internet memes.

While yes, if you are overweight you are more likely to have sleep apnea, it isn't 100% though as its a blockage of air and can happen to skinny people too but water weight begins to get up there and you can store fluids like nobody's biz

I see that as people corrupting a religion to serve their purposes politically and then dumb followers just taking it as scripture. I still get the purpose of religion for community but dumb fuck racists and pollute it and pervert it. The way it's states reads that that is all the religion is is just bigotry. When for many its a sense of unity. It's a hard line to walk though for some as joining the two as mutually exclusive is common like how we see all isotopes as radioactive in pop culture because frequently we see "radioactive isotope" paired together.  </TEXT>

Like i eat meat during lent and crap and i know shina and sunni who drink beer / booze and eat bacon. Just like Jews who eat BLT's and eat shell fish . So please save your strict dogmatic views to your own narrow world view.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doofus Rick is one who proved he was smart. He was able to make no bake brownies with a select bit of Alchemist level chemistry. He knows how to, stop and think before he speaks to know just what to say to be supportive. This takes a large amount of empathy which typically requires the ability to self analyze how one would feel in the situation if they were in the place of the person they are empathizing with. The pause shows a strong level of tact which is also a sign of intelligence.

He does not eat his own poop as said by  Justin Roiland in the commentary track on the DVD / Bluray. And the only people who say that are other Ricks.

So why is he a doofus then by the standards of the other Ricks?

Going to the season 3 opener, the best lies are told with kernels of truth. When Rick c-137 is going through his life and what caused him to be heartless it's the assassination of his child and wife. The Council of Ricks or perhaps even a time traveling evil morty did it. But in a reality where Rick never had Diane and his daughter to begin with he would never turn "heartless" and suicidal. Its most likely the council of Rick though or C-137 Rick thinks its them because why else would he utterly DESTROY them?

Doofus Rick is just as smart as the other ricks, he creates a portal gun, because, why else would the Council of Ricks let him join? He doesn't have the thought of Diane or his daughter in his mind taking precedence in his live over science, 

Doofus Rick is full intelligent Rick, who is lonely but a sweet person with just a Doofus bowl haircut. he understands complex chemistry, he Just is the nicest Rick because he doesn't have true dick punching loss like many other Ricks I bet.

<TEXT> Fascists are for tight close connections between privatization for the public services with a strong military with unflinching jingoism / nationalism 

Communists call for collective ownership of everything but typically have been run by totalitarians.

Fascists though like Franco and Mussolini and to  some extent Hilter (who really pushed for private companies instead of state production) rule by de facto iron fist and if questioned have people with a bundle of big sticks (or fascis) beat people to death with them.

Its funny because Fascists actually have a faggot for their symbol (bundle of sticks)

people seem to confuse authoritarian and the two since the only examples of both are quite litterally been only ever run by a strong man authoritarian.

But communism can be run without an authoritarian but we have never seen one since most communism is actually not even true communism because most don't even follow the Marx view where you had  to be an industrial capitalist developed nation before evolving to working taking control of production and the rise of a communist co-operative state. Most like Russia for example were agrarian societies with little means of production and little in the way of a developed "middle class" to start with which is thought should be part of the precursor to a Marxian Communist society.

Fascism is just extreme right wing Authoritarianism and Xenophobia and Jingoism to keep the rabble in line   </TEXT>

That seem ok? I never made one of these and I think my fiancee would be mad if I told her about it. She is one to keep this to her chest when things about money and her emotions come to the forefront. I also set it for 1000 dollars more than the estimated cost for the specialist because I know Gofundme take a bit of it too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our dog ghira had four seizures today. We took her to the VCA hospital after the third because the first two happened at 10 pm last night and 5am this moring the third happened at noon today and even though we had an appointment at 7pm scheduled we rushed her over and they saw us at 1pm

The thing that makes this worse is i was just in the hospital friday and Saturday night for treatment for what turn d out after a 5 day long migraine to be viral meningitis. 

I'm lucky im on medicare since im unemployed after an internship and going back to university as a returning student to finish up my computer engineering bachelors. 

But i just feel hopeless because i couldn't afford more for my little fur baby. 

Any suggestions on how to help with the nearly $1000 health costs for dogs? She is listed as an emotional support animal for panic attacks and depression for my fiance and I.

Here is her pictures

<TEXT> All rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment is about power and anyone who has to force people or manipulate them to have sex does so to feel powerful or dominant to make up for some other thing they're insecure about.

People who cat call women do so in a maner that doesnt get healthy people but only serves the selfish thoughtless wants of the one doing it. It forces that cat caller's will on a victim and forces that victim to be made to pay attention to an individual who typically is somehow impotent in another facet of their perceived depowered life.

It takes the power of self determination from the victim for the  attacker's / harasser's selfish need and want for attention or emotional manipulation and power over a victim. </TEXT>

Then topping it off with a good dash of xenophobia and racism against a black president for the sake of getting useful idiots to kick out moderate republicans for koch brother centric ideology supporting deomogues who wont even try to find middle ground policy. The last two congresses have been the least productive of any in history because of this dumb fuck extreme ideology that is all been to force disintrest in government as a whole, sell a narrative that government doesn't work, and to kill social safety nets to make workers scared and compliant and do things because they are told to (ie vote for this republican or loose your job), and in all honesty make more money for transnational corporations who have been sold as the innovators when in fact historically it has been publicly funded science that has created the most innovation.

<TEXT> Tell that to the irish who did everything they could to live during the blight who didn't come to the United States. The point is eating the rotten fruit by accident is the same thing. People will do anything to hold on to the life they had, fearing change, fearing the different and new. They would eat the poison fruit with glee as you can see with the election of trump if it gave them the sense that things might feel normal again and be happier times. But it's false hopes from a false prophet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always find stuff like this in extreme feat sports competitions amazing. Gymnastics, figure skating, skate boarding, surfing, and the like require a competetor to push the envelope to perform unimaginable feats like comparing olympic gymnastics from 1920 to the 1990s its like comparing watching a child walk for the first time to Usain Bolt running the fastest time. You have people who push it and force the performance feat sport on its head. I mean look at skateboarding from the 1980s in back yard pool carving to the insane foot tricks today. 

One person spawns an entire paradigm shift in in how people look at the tricks or techniques they can do like this unheard of backflip, now others are going to try and copy and expand this like a remix artist  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shall I go into the history and horrors of the black person's American Experience? From Slavery to Emancipation, from Sharecropping and Jim Crow to Emmit Till and [The whites Firebombing by Crop duster planes of Black Wallstreet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot), from public lynchings and church bombings to civil rights that finally got rid of poll taxes and poll tests designed to disenfranchise poor and educated blacks alike, to the assassination of any common sense leaders who tried to help the community and unite it like Medgar Evers, Harry and Harriette Moore, Fred Hampton, and Martin Luther King. Lastly the fact there is evidence that the crack epidemic that mostly effected poor inner city black communities was done to fund gun running to south american anti communist rebels by the Reagan Administration and the CIA because no one would care about them and destroying their communities which stood opposed to the Republican Agenda which was mostly made up for anti black anti civil rights groups post the Southern Strategy by Nixon to convert the southern democrats. 

And lets talk about laws the then also criminalized crack cocaine vs powder cocaine twice as hard with mandatory minimums so even though powder cocaine is more expensive and higher grade and usually done by white people they are less likely to go to jail for it, [the fact that if have a "black sounding name" even if you have the exact same stats on resume it takes nearly 1/3 longer to get a call back for a job as a white applicant sound name.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-sounding-names-study_us_561697a5e4b0dbb8000d687f)

African Americans make up 13% of the population yet have the highest poverty rate, 27.4 percent, followed by Hispanics at 26.6 percent and whites at 9.9 percent. 45.8 percent of young black children (under age 6) live in poverty, compared to 14.5 percent of white children. And poverty typical is generational and it can be traced back to the Reconstruction and those very Jim Crow Laws that put black men in prison for being black and out past a curfew.

If you want and understanding of the systemic issues blacks have faces i highly suggest watching the documentary [13th on netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_\(film\)). </TEXT>

<TEXT> um you don't understand how statistics work do you?

Trump's win is a statistical anomaly and the fact is based on people polls and the popular vote he lost. 

It is like saying oh hey an organization that has been around for 100 years and has pretty much gotten every election right based on polling and statistical modeling with 10,000 poll size for mathematical statistical reliability to match population and group make up of each area they poll got 1 wrong because of an unseen result except by a small group of people when every other statistical model agreed with them.



Yeah fuck them they called it wrong so they are wrong for life. The Math was there, Hillary won the popular vote, this is what gallop was polling on. Not electoral college. </TEXT>

Make American Great Again? Well america was at it's Greatest in the 1950s by all accounts of the baby boomers and donald trump ... Guess what the tax rate was on the top 5%. during war it got up to 90 % and there was no capital gains tax there was just 1 tax rate on any income you made. And companies had no tax loopholes and paid 45% tax. We also had higher rates of small businesses then too. 45% of the united states worked for self owned shops. now that 15%

We funded sending every soldier to public universities and ONLY public universities. We created great network of schools in California for enlisted Naval Officers to have easy access to. We went to the moon several times and we did so many things to protect art and culture for the sake of history in public museums. </TEXT>

<TEXT> remember to raise you kids knowing this. Never forget it. This country was founded with the goal of immigrants and those oppressed to be free and have a chance. It is a nation that wants you to succeed no matter how much the fear mongers and bigots say else-wise. We are a nation founded on the ideas of getting the world's tired, poor, and huddled masses yearning to to breath free. 

And be your brothers keeper and he will be yours. You pull that man, woman, or child out of the ocean of dispair, you be that savior in the night with every tax dollar we spend on services like education, after school programs, morning and after school meal programs, after school enrichment programs, elderly assistance programs and healthcare access. 

Thank you for making our country more diverse and making it a better tasting hot pot mix of amazingness.

<TEXT> Dude russia is corrupt as fuck and gay people were not a scapegoat problem 10 years ago. The reason why they are banning gay people and information or support for them now is because its Putin's play to keep people distracted and finding enemies within and not looking at his dirty tricks.

You replace gays with jews its the same thing. 

Also I have visited Russia and have a bunch of Russian friends, trust me they are decadent and hedonistic as fuck. Nudity is on tv and so is hardcore porn on broadcast tv. Child poverty is rampant and you see kids huffing paint all over St Petersberg and Moscow. 

Their Culture is one of getting drunk and being bitter and and highly guarded all the time. They are western as fuck and enjoy all the crap we enjoy but Putin plays them like a fiddle and anyone who doesn't go his way falls out a hotel window, dies of radioactive tea, dies of explosion in their apartment on Putin's birthday, or some other what the fuck how the hell jesus christ grandiose assassination  </TEXT>

<TEXT> dude its a pg-13 movie at worst here in the united states and the only reason it got pg-13 because of the fact they got close to saying curse words a bunch of times and oh no sci-fi cartoon like violence and angsty depiction of teens. If this was done by a large movie company like Fox or WB it would be PG easily.

No way this deserves an R rating for something as subtle as a small head nod.

Russians in power are asshole xenophobic, racist, bigoted as fuck, homophobic drunks.

The blur images can now be easily deblured now and you can make out the numbers enough on that one apple card to get an idea of your member number. The Exif information in jpegs edited in photoshop can also keep a thumbnail of the original image before editing in the edited copy so that too.

<TEXT> me and my fiancee left the theater talking about how realistic they made the kids. They showed how kids actually deal with. That bully that gets away with trying to break your wrist, or the clicky cheerleaders, or the jock who hates being golden boy, the kid who is taking care of a sick parent (which hit really hard for me) and isn't Asian kid stereotypical smart kid either, a black kid on the spectrum and explaining it matter of factly without it making him "special", and a gay latinx girl who has a conservative family who doesn't understand her and she doesn't understand herself. Also they showed half of them living in trailer parks and not well off either. The houses they all lived in were real lower middle class households

It had a really good almost "Goonies" vibe to it and made it just seem more realistic. 

Also god i loved how Jason just slapped the bully. He knows he is stronger than the guy and knows shame gets to people far better than straight violence. It was a great trait they put in for him to show he is good at heart.

Also If i know what my goal is from the start the get go it is easier to go for that using less energy and less stress at finding an opening for the first punch or redirecting their punch. It's an offensive defense which has never failed me and if it just enraged the guy they just start going for wild windmilling punches with no direction or force behind them and are easy to then grab and redirect to the ground with basic Aikido.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have i kissed my share of guys? Yes yes i have. But i know i have never gotten an erection from it though and the only time i have twitched in my loins is when its raven haired Mediterranean women. Also i have never had a sex dream of guys. But if you belive in a sliding scale of sexuality as the kinsey scale i would say 0 to 5 straight to gay Im right at the 1 to 2.0

Its a guys voice that turns me off. Even transgender women the falsetto voice still sounds too masculine to me. Baily jay though sounds pretty girlish but im an old school 4channer so line trap is in everyones 34 folder </TEXT>

<TEXT> typically you go in in praying pose and slide in fast spreading your arms wide blocking their arms by spreading their arms apart since their arms are typically in boxer's stance, most people have little to no martial arts experience. You now have your chest against their's with your arms under their's and their arms wipe apart. You then want to grab one arm by wrapping it down pull their arm by the bicep down while wrapping it around and then with the other hand I go for the ass grap while holding the back of their head and then plant the wet one on their lips. This is rather fast and the entire motion is not typical for fighting for people who are trained. I'm not off balancing them so this throws them off. The kiss then comes in with the full handed ass cupping, potentially moving fingers to crack of the pants these unwelcomed advances to anyone adverse to the concept of male on male contact or unwelcome sexual advances completely shocks and freezes a person up ESPECIALLY in public areas where people are watching it happen. The laughter from the crowd also embarrasses the fuck out them and I have seen guys turn bright cherry red from this.
In order to get most guys since I'm 6 foot 5 I drop into a semi position modified horse stance spreading their legs so they cant get in for a knee or a kick. If they did i have them in such a way that i can kick in their heel causing them to fall backward on their ass and timber I go too. 6 foot 5, 400lbs dropping on someone fast hurts a lot.  </TEXT>

Easy enough to deflect or redirect them into a wall or something. But out of some 20 fights I have had to deal with only 2 in the last 15 years have tried coming back. Most are so horrifically violated by the look on their face they shiver and run off. I also go for the ass grab as well with it if they fight too much as the first thing they do then is lower their hands and try to get yours off their ass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> actually trucks are number one cause for air issues in major metropolitan areas that don't have fracking wells. And also I have had people "Roll Coal" at me several times where they change the Mixture through modication of lifted trucks to have their fuel injector over inject fuel on purpose to create blasts of high carbon and unburnt fuel at people. Its dangerous because it is a road hazard and even for events like this its a waste since they could tune the truck to use the fuel better and get just as much torque. The only reason i know most who do it is to say fuck you environmentalists and people i'm told i should have consideration for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find it funny that people who live a life of nothing but pleasure as they age start to turn more and more bitter and angry and look for anything and anyone to blame. This is also a sign of someone who is dealing with some sort of untreated form of depression or Bi-Polar disorder as well. Her risk taking behavior early on and constantly being super high energy in a manic way makes me think she is dealing with rapid switching bipolar type 1 disorder. This will lead to grandiose thinking and her fixation on nazi imagery and playing into that world shows she has lost the attention of normal people and wants to be famous and loved by people who are just as manic and delusional as she is. Anyway you can blame someone for why you feel sad and never confronting the reality is the buck stops with you about why you feel certain ways.

It is far easier to just give out free IUD implantable birth control, and deporpovara pills for women who can't due to wegener's syndrome and copper absorption as well as the fact many women need birth control to help control their cycles and cramping. Not to mention women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome need birth control as one of the drugs to help control the syst growth and limit it.

But by all means lets just sterilize the poor like the did in the 40s and 50s in North Carolina. EUGENICS NOW EUGENICS FOREVER!!!!! /s

<TEXT> Amy Schumer is just like Jeff dunn, you either like them or you dont and if you don't it seems the hate come out in droves. But It happens more to Female and minority comics i notice. Rarely do they talk about joke stealing if it is someone like Robin Williams or Jay More or Denis Leary. Also its like a guy can talk about his cock or having sex but when i woman does it ... WOW no i didn't need ot hear that !!!!!! Most women I know like Amy Schumer because she does jokes that they relate to. As I guy i don't like most of her jokes because its just too crass for me. But I get them and the fact she talks about stuff like Feminine odor and biological stuff which most comics don't talk about allows other typically repressed women to talk about it.  

Ehh I just don't get the vitriolic hate. Her Comedy Central show i find funny, and staff on there is mostly women too for the writing team so i like that they can get a side of humor about being a woman not shown typically. But mehhh Mehhhhhh MEHHHHHH </TEXT>

<TEXT> Conservative American Journalism comes from a very nationalistic slant. It says only our country is great and anyone who questions it is wrong. Liberals use shame in debates because as a form of Ethos it is one of the things Conservatives typically have in spades since they usually say their morals from a strong protestant christian upbringing typically. Conservatives will always use the fear of the other for their ethos in debates, people who are not christian, people who are not white, women who do not listen to the bible and be subservient to men are all trying to take something away from you. They want to take your property or ability to get more property gun rights is entirely a property based debate or the right to shoot things debate. But they are the first to try to outlaw dissenting opinions in historical records. They try to take away the right for people to vote. American Left / Progressive have always fought for everyone being able to vote and for the idea that you help the least fortunate you help the entire country. Since the 30s and the rise of Ayn Rand Libretarianism you have a sect of conservatives who want power by means of economic dominance. That Might means right by the way of a gun or checkbook (either buying or paying a lawyer to sue something out of existence)

Breitbart != Buzzfeed 

Intellectual Poison != Intellectual Junkfood

Washington Examiner vs Washington Post

Conservatives use religion as a tool to instill fear in people that outsiders hoards from beyond the city gate are trying to take your religion away. If you are poor you deserve it, if you are sick you deserve it, Social Darwinism RAR RAR RAR

Liberals are like hey just let people live life and make sure that you make up for fucking over people in the past and help lift people out of the gutter because those people cause crimes out of desperation or untreated medical issues, mental health. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Compare "Liberal satire" to conservative "satire"

there is a level of animosity that comes out of conservative media that wishes to crush their enemies and put them down. There is a level of vitriol you don't see in liberal media. Liberals are depressed and angry but hopeful to all get along. Conservatives come from a we must crush and break our enemies and put them in their place mentality.

Conservatives dehumanize and uses a lot of logical fallacy as arguments and just plane talk based on faith something they do will work. Liberals tend to use facts and figures that comes from multiple sources. 

Liberal media for how ever sided it is still tries to come down in compromise and appeasement. Conservative media is like no fuck you our way our we destroy the world with us, IE government shutdowns.

Alex Jones, Sean Hannity, Glen Beck use hyperbole and fear mongers and not facts to support their agenda ideas for a perfect conservative utopia for a select few chosen people. Liberals go we have no idea how to make it better for everyone but we have studies and facts that show these programs help make it better for everyone.

liberals are bleeding hearts while conservatives will cut off the legs to make a point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> in order to run surveillance in the united states you need something first. It's called a FISA Warrant. A FISA warrant is a requirement under the The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ("FISA" Pub.L. 95511, 92 Stat. 1783, 50 U.S.C. ch. 36). That United States federal law prescribes procedures for the physical and electronic surveillance and collection of "foreign intelligence information" between "foreign powers" and "agents of foreign powers".

Please take the time to do a little research and understand this. Also the NSA / CIA are intelligence agencies and do hacking and monitoring of foreign groups all the time. That is how intelligence is gathered. It is what allows us to make informed decisions as a nation under the leadership of sane and rational president to make the political, military, and diplomatic actions we take as a nation. 

The NSA / CIA are now withholding some of that information from President Trump for fear he will leak it to foreign masters.

There has been no record of a FISA warrant issued on Donald J Trump a united states citizen who would have only had it allowed if a FISA COURT run by a judge agreed with the State's evidence that showed a strong credible evidence that Donald J Trump was an "agent of foreign powers". If there was Donald J trump as now the president of the united states could have released it and unclassified it, but he hasn't and he won't because there is no fisa warrant. Just the rantings of an old 70+ year old man who is a bullshit con artist. 

Hacking happens, security holes sold to government happens, the wikileaks story was a nonstory to anyone in the network security world who goes to hacker cons like Defcon, Shmoo, and such. It is a known thing that government uses exploits to gain intell. Its like i'm shocked shocked I say gambling goes on in this establishment while at the same time collecting your winnings before you shut down the bar.

Donald J Trump is a snowball artist and even says as much in his own books. </TEXT>

<TEXT> US Patent means USA East Coast time, Washington DC Federal USTPO hours

AC-3 is required by many companies from Netflix, Amazon, and video game consoles and dvd / bluray players because it was the format that took over for surround sound, even in video games. There are other formats as well but the fact is the patent doesn't just cover the codec it self it covers how the codec worked and that can block third parties, particularly open standard / open source codecs from being legally released as enhanced superior formats that might take far less space, have far higher fidelity, and take less processing power to process. </TEXT>

I was never great with motion graphics but  I wanted to start learning how to do rotoscoping in after effects and start doing more special effects in videos for fun and giggles, mostly for meme shitposting or for /r/HighqualityGifs. Anyone know if there is any meetup groups for that in Portland?

<TEXT> my diet consists of 4 string cheeses a day for snacks, two eggs in the morning, a 1/3 lb of ground beef with a tablespoon of raw peanut butter and classic pickles for lunch and 3 cups of stevia sweteened coffee with either half half or unsweetened almond milk a day, dinner will be cheap 4oz stake which cost 2 dollars each in a pack of 5 with mushrooms cooked in coconut oil and seasoned with a side of spinach and feta or carne asada soaked in lime juice then night before with a cucumber / tomato chopped up salad.

This is my diet for currently for three months everyday now. Its about 1600 calories a day with no more than 5g of carbohydrates and I just maintain my weight. Why? because damn meds that keep me bloated and fuck up my metabolism because they treat my bipolar type 2 disorder and panic attack disorder. I drink about 5 litters of water a day too with my 1 litter flask I have clipped on my messenger bag.

Its a sisyphean existence because shit fucking sucks and I'm tired of eating the same damn thing over and over. It would be nice to eat pizza or Indian food or some god damn rice. </TEXT>

But hey I guess that look of disgust I get when I'm at the gym or that random person throwing something at me and laughing while I'm riding my bike to work or class is so well deserved. It really motivates me to want to commit suicide and make sure my fat ass ruins someones day having to clean it up in the best possible way. </TEXT>

The news of today is so alien to just 10 years ago. I mean fuck sake fox news is coming to the defense of CNN now when Trump attacks them and calls them fake news. A racist conspiracy rag like the Gateway Pundit and Breitbart have White House Press creds now.

<TEXT>  Budd Dwyer

During the early 1980s, public employees of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania overpaid millions of dollars in Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes. As a result, the state solicited bids from accounting firms to determine refunds for its employees. The contract was eventually awarded to Computer Technology Associates (CTA), a California-based firm, owned by John Torquato, Jr, a native of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Later Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh received an anonymous memo detailing allegations of bribery that took place during the bidding process for the $4.6 million contract.

An investigation was undertaken by federal prosecutors. Dwyer was charged with agreeing to receive kickbacks worth $300,000 in return for using his office to steer the contract toward CTA. The US Attorney also indicted Torquato, Torquato's attorney William T. Smith, Smith's wife, and Bob Asher, the former Republican Party Chairman for the State of Pennsylvania. In return for lighter sentences, Torquato and the Smiths pleaded guilty and testified on behalf of the Federal government against Dwyer and Asher.

Dwyer denied any wrongdoing. Federal prosecutors offered him a single charge of bribe receiving (which would have meant up to a maximum of five years' imprisonment), resignation from his office as Treasurer of Pennsylvania and full cooperation with the government's investigation but he refused. Instead Dwyer went to full trial. However his defense was curtailed by the prosecution because the case was limited to only those who had been charged. The names of the unindicted co-conspirators who were linked in the bribery scandal but were not on trial were withheld. These unnamed individuals were believed to have been staff members of the Dauphin County Republican Party.

On December 18, 1986, Dwyer was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and consequently faced a sentence of up to 55 years' imprisonment and a $300,000 fine. His sentencing was scheduled for January 23, 1987, to be performed by U.S. District Court Judge Malcolm Muir.

Bob Asher, Dwyer's co-defendant, was sentenced to one year in jail. He later returned to politics and served as a Republican national committeeman for Pennsylvania </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy shit .... potter came! I said to myself as i stared wide eyed. Years of this came to this night. It was like my coronation and Potter's corpse would finally be the drape over my throne. To think born of muggle blood I got to become this lord of darkness. It's funny you don't think something like this would ever happen but hey you roll with it. So many wizards in the past fought for power like I had achieved. I sometime wonder why I do this? It seems like a lot of work just for so many damn sycophants. Oh well hmm potter looks ready to die. I wonder, why is it this damn kid caused me so much problems? No matter really, I'm about the Abra kedavra the fuck out of this four-eyed poindexter.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The world was always in a state of flux. As the winds carved their way across the landscape the mountains had been sandblasted down and made smooth lumps of earth. No hard edges existed at all across the landscape anymore as the winds of change always had my world smooth and bare. Rolling hills of sand and dust. The stories of trees and vegetation on the surface were relegated to the thing of legends. 

This is what I was taught in school each day. I was left to dream and wonder about the surface world like all children. But finally my birthday had come. I would take the right of passage and get my own wingsuit. It was time for me to rise from the under-caves we had made our homes. My father had told me the best of us would ride the winds to other lands in search of people to trade with. Very few though ever came back, those who did were never the same. They had a passion of flight, they ran to the surface to be one of the air riders. 

I dreamed for my chance. To ride the winds like a specter of the lands of wind, ready to explore. I raced home after class got out. My mom had made my favorite, lichen and mushrooms, their pale glow in the darkness of the cave always made me lighten up. But now I was about to have more. I would ride those winds tonight. I was ready to be able to see the surface. Once my father came home we would go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just for your knowledge this is basically what gave us the Wizard of Oz series of books by  author L. Frank Baum. He didn't like reading the same basic stories to his kids so he just started making up stories for them and created OZ and Dorthy and everything. Just so you know you might be able to parlay this into something similar. 

Just something to chew on for you to think about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Daft Punk is one of those EDM artist duos that have transcended the genre. But It wasn't until they release Interstellar 5555, their anime visual album did people even give a damn. They became popular because the Iron was hot on the popular acceptance of anime in american culture thanks to Cartoon Network's Toonami Midnight run broadcasting block. Their Album was broadcasted on the Toonami music special night that featured Anime Music Videos produced around Toonami anime shows they broadcasted as well as music from Daft Punk and the Gorillaz first album. </TEXT>

Hiring models for example and only i'm assuming white models when people with a degree in hospitality shows serious issues. The entire thing has a stench of corruption. These kind of practices can have serious class action lawsuits from staff for the issues of making it a hostel working environment and illegal hiring practices.

<TEXT> The point is though you have to work inside the system. Green Party, Libretarian Party, and the even greater extreme Constitution party (they want Christian theocratic law as the law of the land) are all wildly out of step with centrist views and know they create a system that makes the parties become worse. 

The fact is we need to get democrats in who will pass laws that limit the size of political parties so that no one political party can be too big. That you run on platform NOT PARTY and you join a party once you get into office.

Lastly we need Democrats who will push for alternative vote / Instant-Run off voting as well as mail in ballots / online voting with a verified 2Fa system and online ballot verification and paper receipt.

This would allow a concession to the republicans saying you can have a national ID system that has a smart chip on it that then acts as your passport and also you use for signing contracts. Look to Estonia for a country that did it. There National ID is amazing with 2FA and Puplic key encryption on the card itself with chip / pin support.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_ID_card#Cryptographic_use

I can't fucking believe we put uniquely identifiable powerless RFID in god damn United states passports when federal government agency ID cards have had Chip authentication for over 15 years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love the plot of that movie. The bigger message is the adults work so hard willing to sacrifice the children (The next generation) so they can survive when all that really matters is that the next generation survives but with education so they don't become feral animals. 

It really is such a powerful movie if you can understand the message it was trying to get across. Save the children, and make sure they have the knowledge to keep the human race alive. It reminds me of the concept of you can't get the parents out of poverty but if you can get to the parents to teach them how to raise their kids you can get the kids out of poverty. Look up information on the Harlem Children's Zone non-profit and founder Geoffrey Canada. </TEXT>

There is a growing segment of the predominantly only male sect of the tech/silicon valley sector who are jumping on to this idea. Peter Thiel is one of them as he even wants to make a "floating city" where slavery can be legal.

You are a nazi and I have the right to refuse service to anyone who isn't on this list of people who are minorities have have been abused by people like you."

If they don't leave you can then call the police on them for trespassing. You have a right to free speech but you don't have the right to that in a private establishment. If nazi's want to do that they should open up their own bar, with blonde blue eyed hookers and swastikas. But I doubt they will be able to keep it open for long because you know ....

<TEXT> yes .... a source called "the federalist" isn't at all bias 

 Addressing slavery in the Constitution, James Madison set out with a view that African American slaves as an "unfortunate race" and believed their true nature was both human and property. On February 12, 1788, Madison, in the Federalist Letter No. 54, stated that the Constitutional three-fifths compromise clause was the best alternative for the slaves' current condition and for determining representation of citizens in Congress. Madison believed that slaves, as property, would be protected by both their masters and the government </TEXT>

<TEXT> The electoral college was created to give power to slave states that had lower populations, and well supported slaves. It was entirely racist to begin with. 

 The delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention had a variety of reasons for settling on the electoral college format, but protecting smaller states was not among them. Some delegates feared direct democracy, but that was only one factor in the debate.
 
 Remember what the country looked like in 1787: The important division was between states that relied on slavery and those that didnt, not between large and small states. A direct election for president did not sit well with most delegates from the slave states, which had large populations but far fewer eligible voters. They gravitated toward the electoral college as a compromise because it was based on population. The convention had agreed to count each slave as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of calculating each states allotment of seats in Congress. For Virginia, which had the largest population among the original 13 states, that meant more clout in choosing the president.

<TEXT> No, In order to get wiretaps you need to go to the FiSA court. The FiSA court is a top secret court setup after the passing of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ("FISA" Pub.L. 95511, 92 Stat. 1783, 50 U.S.C. ch. 36). FiSA "Act" in the United States federal law prescribes procedures for the physical and electronic surveillance and collection of "foreign intelligence information" between "foreign powers" and "agents of foreign powers"

In order to do wiretaps on us soil to United States citizens who are "agent's of a foreign powers" you have to show evidence to a judge that keeps the records sealed. The judge then has to ok the wiretaps with warrant that is kept on private clearance only record with all the evidence and reasons for the wiretap. The house intelligence committee is allowed access to these requests and typically they are actually done by a joint task force of the FBI and NSA with NSA providing analyst support while the FBI does the.

Basically this law and this court is a check and balance that allows the government to have both accountability after the fact to show they did everything above board with proper legal coverage for them and the people they investigated. This also protects the evidence collected in wiretaps as legally recorded and collected materials so that the chain of evidence is kept secure and also clear of how its operated. 

While normal citizens can't get FiSA court records until they are declassified the fact is the FiSA court is again a check box that must be filled to protect your rights as a citizen for later record purposes. The FiSA court was potentially abused during GW Bush's time in office with the fact they tried to bury any records of tap on innocent muslim americans and the kidnapping of Muslim Americans and foreign citizens in non combat / war countries with rendition to black CIA interrogation sites. 

But that is beyond the scope of the the FiSA court wiretap warrants though and goes into a whole other kettle of klusterfuk fish and human rights abuses as well as encroaching on the sovereign soil and foreign rights of foreign citizens. </TEXT>

Loved listening to this song when I was in high school and would spin it when I deejayed. Still on my chill tracks playlist. Probably one of the things i loved about Maryland growing up in the 90s was how amazing the dance music scene was there. Man I miss Buzz Life and nations. I used to come into Yoshitoshi all the time to get a few records once a month before you closed the store. Your store closing, Bush getting elected, the dot com crash, and graduating high school all happened in that year for me and It was kind of really harsh. But Thank you again for your music.

If you want to feel old I was 14 when the track came out and I'm 32 now.

I always felt the Rave Act and the death of the Capitol Ballroom / Buzz Night / Alchemy kind of put the nail in the coffin of electronic dance music in america. It was relegated to fluff or filler stuff afterwards by mainstream culture. What is your view on this assessment?  </TEXT>

Probably one of the things i loved about Maryland growing up in the 90s was how amazing the dance music scene was there. Man I miss Buzz Life and nations. I used to come into Yoshitoshi all the time to get a few records once a month before you closed the store. Your store closing, Bush getting elected, the dot com crash, and graduating high school all happened in that year for me and It was kind of really harsh. But Thank you again for your music. 

If you want to feel old I was 14 when the track came out and I'm 32 now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what made Joss Whedon such a great director. These exact same scenes are in Buffy The Vampire Slayer tv show, or well similar and the sarcasm between everyone is a lot more natural. It would be interesting to travel to a universe where Whedon got to also direct the Buffy The Vampire Slayer movie. </TEXT>

amy schumer pissed off the "but my mens' rights" crowd and now you are going after her, what about going after Robin Williams or Conan O'brien? Hell even Denis Leary has stolen jokes and I don't see people going off the kilter for them!

I don't even like amy schumer she is too abrasive for me but seriously it happens and even beloved figures like Robin Williams are accused and people have proof of him doing it.

http://entertainment.time.com/2013/06/20/patton-oswalt-on-the-unsavory-business-of-joke-theft/

Anyway if you don't like Schumer check out Iliza Shlesinger and her three netflix specials. [Party Goblin for the win!](https://youtu.be/k1EfHpx400U) [No More Mermaids too.](https://youtu.be/_SQWH8TEeUI) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chad is the quintessential white preppy rich frat jock guy you saw in 80s horror movies. Chad, Taylor, Steve, and Richard are about 6 names black community started having for these frat asshole. Basically a brocoder is a Chad, a Wallstreet stock guy is a Chad. These are people who usually say they did everything on their own and had no help but don't count mom and dad paying for school, giving them all the school supplies they needed, the car at 16 and 18 when they partied to much and crashed the first one. 

They are the type of people who are like affirmative action is racist against them and don't even take the time to think that affirmative action helps level the playing field or tries to help play catch up for a minority demographic who do not normally get to make the same educational, political, career, or personal connections someone who got in on "donation acceptance" into college gets.

Chad is Ebay CEO's Meg Whitman son who's mom donated 10 million dollars to Princeton and her C grade student son gets in and then she donates another 10 million to keep him from getting expelled after he was in a drunken on campus altercation while underage.

Chad in the end or Taylor or the rest is akin to saying Bonnie, Barbie, BonBon, Ashley, Veronica when referring to rich privileged kids who complain when the system doesn't cater to them and their Affluenza.

But granted the names do change over time because what rich people named their kids in the 80s are now what white trash people name their kids in the 90s and so forth.

[Freakenomics podcast and book did a rather great story about this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaU9vmL8i3Y) They also did a thing about what is in a name. It compared people who had "black sounding" names verse "white sounding" names and found that black sounding names with the exact same resume were 33% less likely to find a job than a white sounding name with the same resume meaning black people with black sounding names take up to 5 weeks longer to find a job interview.

I'm talking about actions like volunteering at soup kitcken once in a blue moon and then bragging about how generous you are. 

Volunteering should be a humble action that you do. You should do it because you want to help. 

Again calling out bigots should not be anything special. Its a civic responsibility to do it and should just be muscle memory and instinctual. 

Again i think you are missing my entire point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dog whistle politics usually refers to the use of certain code words or phrases that are designed to be understood by only a small section of the populace. Generally speaking, these are phrases that have special meaning to that subsection entirely independent of its meaning to others, and represent a particularly insidious use of loaded language.
The term alludes to the sound of a dog whistle, which can only be heard by the intended audience (the dog). In theory at least, dog whistle terms are only noticed and understood by the people they are intended for. In practice, the meaning is often understood by others. For example, negative references to "ghettos" are taken by pretty much everyone to mean "black parts of town."

<TEXT> Trump foundation was shut down after it was being investigated for fraud in 4 states. Mostly becuase of the reporting how Trump used Trump Foundation to buy a huge painting of himself to hang at Mar-Largo resort, that he used it to personally buy a Tim Tebow signed helmet, and last because it used Trump foundation donations to pay for the replacement of a flag pole he had too tall for Florida rules. 


It was hilarious as his son cried out that they did so much to help people. But later it was found out that no organization has any record of any donations from Trump Foundation. In particular to military veteran support groups trump said he made a 10 million dollar donations to. The Washington Post called up all of them and all of them reported not a single sent or contact from the Trump Foundation for a donation.  </TEXT>

What did Trump donate to? Himself for a signed helmet of Tim Tebow, a huge painting of himself that he hung up in his private resort, and a replacement of a flag pole because he was sued for violating Florida law ....

Oh wait i forgot he didn't donate any of that money. It came from donations made to the Trump "charity" which is under investigation by 4 different state attorney generals for fraud and violations before he shut it down ... but that still doesn't stop the fraud investigation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm alive thanks to the affordable care act. I have medications that keep me from trying to kill myself and I have therapist and doctor that keep me sane while i'm going to school with support from the American with disabilities act making sure I get help for my issues and accommodations for my disabilities.  I actually have a 3.7 GPA in Computer engineering and i'm in the honors society now because of that extra help protected and supported by democrats. I also am able to afford to go to school at 32 because of pell grants covering my classes. So When i look at the teams and i see them as the ones who cheered for this video clip right here of Ron Paul ... [yeah i think there might just be some evil ass fucks on the republicans team.](https://youtu.be/8T9fk7NpgIU) 

There are inept people on the democrats don't get me wrong but democrats typically in the last 30 years have done nothing but make sure people got treated equally and had protections under the law for the rights to vote, have fair representation for their vote, had legal representation if they couldn't afford it, and pretty much made sure that kids had food if they were poor, kids could go to school, and kids like me with learning disabilities didn't get tracked into an education track with kids who liked to burn things or eat paste. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When someone says being gay is a sin, being transgender is sin, being able to control when something gestates inside of your body but said hey you can't limit mentally ill people, (my self included one I'm depressive Bipolar type 2, with panic attack disorder, and Persistent depressive disorder aka dysthymia ), or spousal abusers or people with restraining orders from buying guns I got issues with them. When 4 of the people on the science and technology Congressional committee including it's chairman believe the world is only 10,000 years old I got issue with that.

peace and prosperity for only one group of people, race, or religion is not peace and prosperity for all. The Republican party is an extremist cult now that only helps those who mockingly wave the conservative jingoism flag around while caring a cross and shooting people who are minorities who dare question their edicts from "god" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sadly think the innocent days of Jimmies rustling is long gone and i really only wish it would return. We are in darker times now. 4chan is an agent of the state now. They are the brown shirts and they are the the state meme alchemists. They work for the government now with arrogant smiles and slack jawed laughing free of charge with maniacal cult member like glee. Memes have been weaponize and perverted from simple innocent jokes of innocent human folly to something cruel, something vicious, something unclean.

Notice how every meme on 4chan for example now is entirely racist as fuck and nazi like as fuck and always promotes a political autocratic anti democracy populous idea. The bitter loneliness of incels and /b/tards who grew up past 20 and still stayed on /b/ or moved to /pol/ as their only outlet have become these demonic ghouls of internalized rage and bitter vile. Its like watching the wild men of the woods and the Easterlings join Sauron's army against their own kind for only limited folly.

From Anarchists, to Libertarians, to Fascists the tumble of political leanings 4chan and dark realm of memes have been corrupted and perverted. Its like watching propaganda run by retards but because its bombarding people so often its like being hit with a hammer over and over again until you finally scream "2+2=5" or there are five lights when there was only ever four!

There is no greater truth but the truth sold to you by the state now and empirical evidence that contradicts that "truth" is thrown on the book burning pile with great applause and laughter from the peanut gallery. </TEXT>

My mom dying was more a relief because she was no longer suffering and I was happy she didn't have to see Trump take over the white house.

Buffy was this family tradition in our house and we watched it like it was going to church when it was on Tuesdays at 8pm on the WB. So many VHS tapes ... so so many. </TEXT>

This corn is the manority of what americas in the middle America produce now and it is only used or the agrochemicals industry creating perservitive and sweetener HFCS (high fructose corn syrup), corn syrup, xanthum gum, and 40 other some odd food additives for the automated food production industry which produces food which has long shelf lifes, high calorie count, but very poor nutritional value. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is you can see the direct connection between the socio economic trends of the time. Many people in the rust belt have lost all hope. They have no community but ghost towns that have been gutted by Walmarts killing small town main streets. They have lost all of their jobs because transnational corporations do not like that americans are uppity and demand like rights and stuff so they moved their factories that haven't figured out how to automate out 90% of the work force to asia.

in the 60s it was psychedelics to distract from war and racism and sexual violence.

in the 70s it was heroine because it was the kids grown up and still trying to party but not having anything to do.

in the 80s it was cocaine as jobs were plentiful and and people were being trained to fuck everyone else and take. It allowed people to work long hours and not have any sense of caring.

90s was the birth of designer drugs that have both stimulant effects and hallucinogens

2000 was the start of the prescription synthetic opiate craze

and now in the 2010s we are back at heroine as the drug of choice of the masses thanks to the fact its easier and cheaper to get than oxycotin. This has then circled back to the 90s since we are going though that culture again with 90s music, 90s themed tv shows, and such and now we have the rise of synthetic opiates which are 1000 times stronger and technically not illegal because they have not be classified.

Pot has always been there through all this time but it doesn't cause issues when its decriminalized. It's only when it's criminalized that you have a rise of cartel violence and other drugs from drug manufactures become addictions of choice. 


But the end is right now the rust belt in america feels broken, lost, and they want someone to blame. They can't blame themselves because they can't see they themselves allowed industry to control them and break their will, so they turn to drugs that make them completely sedated and blissful. Its funny because opium uptake in post world war 1 germany was also rife. I think there might be a correlation that show the rise of populism and demagogy particularly with the rampant abuse of sedatives. After demagogues take over though typically they outlaw the drugs and highly criminalize it's users but then promote using speed / amphetamines in their place to make the citizens work faster and longer with smaller pay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was 13 episode midseason replacement on a then an upstart 3rd tier broadcast tv network. The show had no budget what so ever but has some really great stories that constantly get love later in the series though. Buffy made the WB and was the cornerstone till the CW / CBS switch over and buffy moving to UPN and even then UPN was kept alive longer than it should have because of that buffy migration too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Buffy is one of those shows that defined modern feminism in television. Its one of those phenomena that has college classes about it at harvard.

Buffy was Joss Whedon's treatise about the issues of growing up a girl to a woman in modern america with the glitz and polish of demons, spooks, and vampires. Not only that buffy isn't a great student, she isn't popular because she is dealing with "working her way through school" and it deals with the issues of class struggle as well. 

The show touched the issues of teenage sex and the fact not all boyfriends treat you well, it dealt with issues of toxic relationships in real manner, it dealt with accurate depictions of survivor's guilt, what its like being a "beta male" with the group of friends she has particularly the one named Xander Harris. It made it ok to realize not everyone has to go to college to eventually do well in life. 

It was a show ahead of it's time and survived two major time slot changes, and two major broadcast television channel switches, from WB / CW / UPN. If you want a show that is witty, gets the struggles of young life, deals with them in adult manner but also funny ways with unique supernatural villians and long running plot lines that just make you squeal when they reveal, Buffy is your show.

Congress has to give permission for any gift or formal title from a foreign country to a sitting president or elected official so to make sure that that elected official does not take bribes to help foreign countries or non-citizens of the united states for a quid pro quo exchange. Trademarks count as gifts / titles. This is the corner stone of the Emoluments Clause.

<TEXT> I agree it should and it should be highly regulated like they do in Australia and Germany. Where the power is in the woman's hands and the men come to the women in a safe space that provides round the clock security. But that is not what anyone wants who uses the services. They want to control their workers or if possible make them slaves who have no power. This is what happens many time after time and why human trafficking is mostly related to the human sex trafficking trade. </TEXT>

<TEXT> China has granted preliminary approval to 38 new Trump-related trademarks as President Trump's family works to develop a series of branded products in the country, including hotel chains, escort services and insurance.

KEYNOTE THE ESCORT AGENCY PART

The new trademarks are considered by some to be a conflict of interest, especially as three of the trademarks were specifically made under the president's name.

The approval is preliminary and will be formally registered in 90 days, if no one objects to the trademarks.

But note, escort agency, meaning Trump is going to be a bloated rich, violent, woman abusing pimp in bad fitting suits we all know him to be out in the open now. Also knowing him he is going to be in for human trafficking and sex slaves to real actual morally corrupt billionaires

While Trump will never be one of them, a billionaire that is, at least he gets to service them now so maybe they might let him play with the cool rich kids like he always dreamed ...... nahhhhhhhhh still a loser who tries too hard </TEXT>

<TITLE> setting up SSH instead of FTP for Wordpress plugin install / updates </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-01 09:57:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So i'm hosting my Wordpress page on a VPS and this is my first time setting up wordpress that wasn't a single install from an automated system. I'm reading conflicting and outdated reports on how best to do this. My system is running the latest for Wordpress, PHP7, and apache latest and MariaDB with myphpadmin as well on a Ubuntu 16.04 

I want to setup the update, theme install, plugin install so that it can just do it from the menu easily but it requires FTP or FTPS for ssl connection. Knowing a little bit i don't want to use plain text FTP to do that because its stupid. I want to use SFTP / SSH but the tutorials i find all have you installing files with projects that have been deprecated like sshphplib.

Any help here would be great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While Scientology is a cult they know how to play the system well. They obtained their tax exemption from the IRS by having P.I.s dig into the personal lives of IRS managers initiating hundreds of lawsuits against IRS employees. Eventually Scientology offered to drop all suits for religious tax exemption and the US government caved.

Let us take this as an example of what to do to Congressmen, Senators, the state department, the department of Homeland security, the IRS, and the Department of Defense under the Trump Occupation.

I think there should be lawsuits and calls for ethics violations on all them from a class action of people. I think this is something we should highly organize. Lawsuits for Ethical Government Justice. They should never have been allowed to vote on someone who donated to them. It flying in the face of impartiality and shows direct bias.

There is no photoshopping or image edits to this image. This is what the guy actually looks like. Like someone hit him in the face with a shovel and he woke up in an alley after drinking bottom shelf malt liquor all night for 20 years.  He also writes all of Donald Trump's executive orders, Including the Muslim ban one. He also has installed himself into a seat of power  over military leaders and kicked them out of a closed door security council which can choose who to kill who are actual american citizens which is not even recorded for later record with an Executive Order Donald Trump didn't even read or briefed on what was in it before signing it. Donald Trump was then very mad after finding out in the leaks coming out of the white house.

Bannon is also obsessed about a book that is about the 20 year cycle of american history in four part cycle. Based on a theory by authors William Strauss and Neil Howe they believe that the US History comes in four cycles. High, Awakening, Unraveling, and Crisis. Crisis is always lead by some major cataclysmic war in example World War 2, The civil war.  Bannon is intent on seeing though this idea and wants us to go to world war with China with bloody results because he is in a doomsday like mindset that we are on the tipping point of Crisis cycle and it his job to invoke it and destroy america to rebuild it in a nationalistic jingoistic white supremacist image he envisions.

A friend of mine wrote this part and I'm posting it below for you to read.


###The Battle Ahead###

major conflict looming for western democracies; it will likely devolve into world war. It could come in a matter of days or weeks; or perhaps, if we are lucky, growing awareness of the path we are on could forestall it. Regardless, the consequences are significant and it will affect everyone.

This will be disturbing to read and you may be tempted to discard it; I encourage you to give it a chance.
Since the end of World War II, the west has settled into an ossified and brittle peace. The conventional wisdom is that a mix of democracy, technology, trade, tolerance, capitalism, a social safety net, and open borders are a sure-fire recipe for sustained economic growth and continuous improvement of society.

In broad measures, this has been true: the world is safer, and the number of people living in poverty keeps dropping. We have managed to build a world that is more connected and open than ever before, and arguably civilization has achieved a peak that could only have been dreamed of 100 or 150 years ago.
But there are serious problems that have festered, mostly unchecked:

1. Crony capitalism has created enormous wealth for a few, but at the expense of many. Using asymmetric information, capitalism has been rendered "risk free" for the well connected: privatizing upside gains while socializing downside risk.
2. Inequality is a major problem. We have built structural racism and white supremacy into our institutions. Instead of slavery or Jim Crow, we now enslave people through economics. Whether you want to cite high price cell phones targeted at the underbanked, or bail bonds, or the unfair lending practices, many black, brown and other minorities are unfairly targeted by an unlevel playing field, day after day.
3. Our politics has become arrogant, ossified, and stale. The fact that we just conducted a presidential election with a few dozen dull primary contenders, and finished it up with a battle between three relics from the culture wars gives a good sense that we have run out of new blood. Our parties are in disarray, and really, don't know what they are actually about anymore.

So onto this stage of general progress, but diminished, weakened political culture walks Stephen Bannon.
Bannon's background is well documented. But the most important thing to know about Bannon is his penchant for drama  and his obsession with the book "The Fourth Turning."

Written in 1997 by the historians Strauss and Howe, it aims to describe the cyclical nature of generational history. They posit that there are "turns" of roughly 20 years that define all of modern human history. They have studied it in detail, and their observations largely ring true.
Whether or not you believe their theory, it is important to know that Bannon does. And he seems to be taking it as a kind of literal gospel, enacting its prognostications with Biblical zeal.

He appears to believe that he is a historical figure charged to take on the task of provoking the "Fourth Turning" that the book predicts  but which largely has not taken place, though arguably some early signs are present.

But Bannon has asserted that the Fourth Turning has begun. And, in this, Bannon is perhaps quantitatively right: Western democracies have been signaling that something is very wrong, with about 50% of voters selecting candidates and platforms that represent a sharp break from our incremental, progressive past.
But here's the thing: Strauss and Howe suggest that this "Crisis" phase of the Fourth Turning will almost certainly result in authoritarian, absolutist rule  as the outcome of a total, decisive war. They suggest that minorities will be targeted and demonized. And that dissent will not be tolerated.

That may be an observation one can make about generational cycles in the past, but it is in on the wrong side of modern history and the enlightenment, whose arc does bend toward justice.

So it would seem that Bannon, who is a provocateur, a showman, a horrible white nationalist, and an all around Rasputin-like figure, is using the book as a kind of historical "excuse" to pursue his agenda: "it will happen anyway," he might argue. He's just here to provoke the inevitable.
And in one thing he is right: our brittle, ossified Western democracies are due for a reset and a good kick in the pants. We need to get serious about fixing the serious structural flaws that people very rightly are concerned about. We need to plan for what a world without work might look like.

And fixing this could even be violent, depending on what forces are unleashed.
But no matter what, this entry can never be an excuse for Steve Bannon (along with his backers, Robert and Rebekah Mercer) to pursue a white nationalist and authoritarian agenda for the world's most powerful democracy.
With each passing day, he is enacting measures that aggravate (a term used in Fourth Turning) societys fault lines and push it closer to the brink of collapse. Installing members of his network (DeVos) in cabinet posts; the travel ban (affecting at least 100,000 people in its first days); giving banks more leverage by undoing Dodd-Frank; we could go on and on, and were only two weeks in.
His intentions are not what they seem on the surface; his true intention is to push a fragile, interconnected, and complex society to actually collapse  so that it can be rebuilt in *his* image. I ask simply: is this what you want? Did you vote for this? Did anyone vote for *this*?

So now, the challenge: there are three options.

1. either the forces of conflict are already unleashed, and we will fall into a brutal nonlinear war where Bannon's darkest fantasies are fulfilled, or
2. the forces of conflict are already unleashed, and we take responsibility for the failings of democracy, and fight to preserve our values of openness, tolerance, and free speech, even in the face of brutal conflict, or
3. we have not yet hit the point of no return, and can still use our institutions to flush out the threat that Bannon poses, while seriously addressing the vulnerability he aimed to exploit.

There is no workable alternative. We each must choose whether we will protect the values this country was founded on, and we must do so now. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here is a the basic run down about the Trump, Russia hacking and blackmail by Putin connections; why Putin is controlling Trump as a "Useful idiot" and potentially how from what I have gathered. If you want to know why, Here goes

1) Trump owes Blackstone/ Bayrock group $560 million dollars (one of his largest debtors and the primary reason he won't reveal his tax returns)

2) Blackstone is owned wholly by Russian billionaires, who owe their position to Putin and have made billions from their work with the Russian government.

3) Other companies that have borrowed from Blackstone have claimed that owing money to them is like owing to the Russian mob and while you owe them, they own you for many favors.

4) The Russian economy is badly faltering under the weight of its over-dependence on raw materials which as you know have plummeted in the last 2 years leaving the Russian economy scrambling to pay its debts.

5) Russia has an impetus to influence our election to ensure the per barrel oil prices are above $65 ( they are currently hovering around $50)

6) Russia can't affordably get at 80% of its oil reserves and reduce its per barrel cost to compete with America at $45 or Saudi Arabia at $39. With Iranian sanctions being lifted Russia will find another inexpensive competitor increasing production and pushing Russia further down the list of suppliers. As for Iranian sanctions, the 6 countries lifting them allowing Iran to collect on the billions it is owed for pumping oil but not being paid for it. These billions Iran can only get if the Iranian nuclear deal is signed. Trump spoke of ending the deals which would cause oil sales sanctions to be reimposed, which would make Russian oil more competitive.

7) Rex Tillerson (Trump's pick for Secretary of State) is the head of ExxonMobil, which is in possession of patented technology that could help Putin extract 45% more oil at a significant cost savings to Russia, helping Putin put money in the Russian coffers to help reconstitute its military and finally afford to mass produce the new and improved systems that it had invented before the Russian economy had slowed so much.

8) Putin cannot get access to these new cost saving technologies OR outside oil field development money, due to US sanctions on Russia, because of its involvement in Ukrainian civil war.

9) Look for Trump to end sanctions on Russia and to back out of the Iranian nuclear deal, to help Russia rebuild its economy, strengthen Putin and make Tillerson and Trump even richer, thus allowing Trump to satisfy his creditors at Blackstone.

10) With Trump's fabricated hatred of NATO and the U.N., the Russian military reconstituted, the threat to the Baltic states is real. Russia retaking their access to the Baltic Sea from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and threatening the shipping of millions of cubic feet of natural gas to lower Europe from Scandinavia, would allow Russia to make a good case for its oil and gas being piped into eastern Europe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanted to post something about her.

This morning my mother, [Name Removed], passed away peacefully at home in her bed with my dad, sister [Name Removed] and her husband / my brother in law [Name Removed] by her side in [Location Removed]. She had been battling numerous health issues since I was a young teenager, but for the past five years it had finally taken it's toll.

She gave me a passion for the sciences and arts, explaining how even with learning disabilities she won the International Science and Engineering Fair in [Year Removed] in [Location Removed], doing meticulous research, lab notes, and experimentation with fruit flies finding the effects of different degrees of radiation on multiple generations of their offspring. She read to me and my sisters endlessly. She gave us our voracious passion for classical literature and modern lit. She taught my sisters, I, many other children, and young adults the passion for theater and the spoken arts when she was a theater professor. She had us learn to talk with marbles in our mouths and a cork between our teeth for proper diction. She instilled in us a love for British theater and it's history of as she had studied for grad school dramatic arts in London, England and being a student usher at The Old Vic Theatre. I grew up with her telling stories and sharing pictures with friends of her adventures hanging out with the likes of Sir John Gielgud, Sir Laurence Olivier, and auditioning for theater academy programs in London alongside the likes of Carrie Fisher.

She taught me the importance of groups like the ACLU and how everyone should have the right to public free speech, but she also taught me that speech will always have a price. She taught me the importance of Civil Rights and equal protections under the law for all people and what feminism means. The taught me that it only gets better for yourself if you fight for everyone to be able to have those same rights and protections. She instilled my very core of political ideas. She gave me a love for good scotch. She gave me my dark gallows humor that's for certain.

She was an educator, a thespian, and my mom. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm 32 years old. My mom has been in an out of the hospital since I was 14 due to a complications from a condition called ArnoldChiari malformation. Her health took a serious decline after a fall a few years ago and since 2010 she has been in and out of the hospital and nursing homes since then. But finally she is going to die. She checked herself out with my family back in Maryland, with me living in Portland Oregon with my fiancee.

I before I moved from Maryland to Los Angeles 3 years ago I took care of my mom for my dad because she was in the medicare gap period. She was wasn't old enough for medicare but my dad couldn't afford the nurse for her. I was working from home as a slave wage tech / blogger journalist so my life was pretty much open. So i moved home and took care of my mom. After she got back on her feet at the time I had to move. I moved to Los Angeles met my fiance, was able to go back to school with a disability status I have for Depression / Bipolar and then after some time I moved to Portland with my Fiancee. I have had a pretty decent year with a great software engineering internship but it seems after winter shit hits the fan and my own depression started to hit hard, my internship ended early due to team members demanding to move back to Ireland after the election, and pretty much just feeling like failure.

My sister and dad calling me about my mom who is now high on morphine because of the pain she is in and under hospice care is a nice cherry on the top of the shit mountain that was 2016. I want to get drunk, i want to run away, I want to scream. I feel like everything I thought about and cared about is destroyed. I'm just lucky I have my Fiancee and have her love. But fuck this whole thing, fuck it all! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has anyone here taken the time to think about the rise in price of game consoles and electronics and video games from the proposed import tariffs Trump plans on implementing? 

 20% tax on all imported goods 

 If we want jobs in America, we need to enact my 5-part tax policy: kill the death tax; lower the tax rates on capital gains   dividends; eliminate corporate taxes in order to create more American jobs; mandate a 15% tax for outsourcing jobs and a 20% tax for importing goods, and enact the 1-5-10-15 income tax plan [four brackets with a top rate of 15%].
Government needs to stop pick-pocketing your wallet. Every time it does, it slows growth and kills jobs. It's also immoral.

Source: Time to Get Tough, by Donald Trump, p. 65 , Dec 5, 2011


 In an interview with the New York Times editorial board, Trump said he would support a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States.

In a Republican debate, his then-presidential rival Ted Cruz brought up his past comments on trade. Trump responded, "The 45-percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell."

 If we want jobs in America, we need to enact my 5-part tax policy: kill the death tax; lower the tax rates on capital gains   dividends; eliminate corporate taxes in order to create more American jobs; mandate a 15% tax for outsourcing jobs and a 20% tax for importing goods, and enact the 1-5-10-15 income tax plan [four brackets with a top rate of 15%].
Government needs to stop pick-pocketing your wallet. Every time it does, it slows growth and kills jobs. It's also immoral.

Source: Time to Get Tough, by Donald Trump, p. 65 , Dec 5, 2011


 In an interview with the New York Times editorial board, Trump said he would support a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States.

In a Republican debate, his then-presidential rival Ted Cruz brought up his past comments on trade. Trump responded, "The 45-percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell."

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two weeks ago early in the morning at 7am while me an my fiancee were packing for a trip and getting ready for work that day someone came into our apartment. We were both naked and while I was in the bathroom my fiancee was in the living room. The person was fuddling with the lock with out even knocking and then unlocked the door and came in. My fiancee wasn't wearing her glasses so while the person saw her fully naked she couldn't see them. I heard him go, "OH, i'm sorry!" shocked and turns and run. 

I ran to the door, but naked couldn't follow down the hall as I saw his backside as he entered the stairs entry and b line out.

What makes it worse he my fiancee then got dressed and went downstairs to walk our dog real quick, leaving the door unlocked. I was in the bathroom after getting dressed myself and heard someone locking the door but though it was her. Five minutes later when she came back the door was locked. And I had to come and unlock it.

My fiancee was so freaked out by this that she had us take our dog with us when I took her to work, i came back to wait till the apartment office opened at 10am to talk to the staff. I ran into the new building service manager though first and let him know what happened and he was actually really apologetic and said that it could have been a vendor who was supposed to clean the same apartment number but in building A, not our building B.

30 minutes later I went to the office after it opened to be confronted by a replacement office / apartment manager, as ours was out on vacation. She said it was impossible what I said had happened. That they had all the vendor keys and no one could have come in and I must have left the door unlocked. She was highly on the defensive. I never even mentioned vendor keys though and she was the first to say it wasn't their vendors. 

Fast forward to this last weekend after I got back from a work trip and my fiancee had come with me. I send an email to the apartment manager so there is a paper trail explaining what happened and I was then informed I should have told them sooner. The manager has been nothing but helpful normally but I lost it. How on earth was she never informed about this unscheduled intrusion? My fiancee now doesn't feel safe at this apartment anymore and we have already found a new place. 

The question is what should I do now? 

Is there a way to get out of having to pay the lease breaking fee since someone entered without permission or knocking? Do I file a police report? The only people who have touched our door and lock are my fiancee, dog, and I since the incident. So who ever touched the lock to unlock it for a vendor key, which is the only logical answer, since they had to come back to re-lock it. Turns out a feature of the locks in are apartment is that if a vendor key is used to unlock a door only a vendor key can re-lock it. 

I'm in Washington County (Hillsboro), Oregon outside of Portland.

What do you personally think about this for the spec and how this will either limit it or force it to upgrade? I would love to see the spec get a dedicated power option that can hold at most 120 watts this might mean thunderbolt 4 high power special cables then but something that forces a standard. HP, Dell, and Lenovo all have docks that don't follow spec to provide power to their own laptops. Now does this mean third party cables won't provide power now ?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So i moved to portland back in the end of July. I was on MediCal at the time coming from California and Was still covered for a month when I had to go to the ER for serious back pains I thought were something worse. I called MediCal Healthnet before I went to the ER and they said that I was still covered for a Month  after moving so it was ok to go to the ER in Portland. 

Kaiser got my information and actually still has the information I originally gave them but only now in May of 2016 has actually billed me. The MediCal Healthnet no longer is active and I have insurance through my internship that isn't Kaiser. Is there a way to fix this screw up it feels from their part because at the time I was covered with MediCal Healthnet? If the original ER visit was while I was still covered isn't MediCal supposed to honor it? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> so i get a discount for the company i work at. I was gonna pick up a pack they have for $500 that includes a Intel PCI SSD, Intel 6700k, GA-Z170X-Gaming G1 Mother board. 

Now What video card should I get if I want to use just add cards over time as they get cheaper in SLI or Crossfire? 

The discount I get on Video cards is negligible and I already have extra SSD drives as well for secondary Drivers. 

Should i go Nvidia or ATI?

What ddr4 memory should i go with?

Also what case do you recommend for this board if i want something clean without LEDs and crazy gimmicks? I want to put this near my home theater system for the short term till I get a dedicated 4k gaming monitor. Also want to have this be Vive ready for later.

Function is the most important factor here for me here and I just want something clean looking. </TEXT>

<TITLE> DS216play - Network slowdowns since putting it on my network </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-13 17:11:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been having crawling network speeds since I put the DS216play on my network. It's on a switch from a Netgear 802.11ac router that is just set up as an AP and switch mode only. That switch/AP is then on a port to the router which is on another Trendnet gigabit switch that then plugs into a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter which is handling the actual routing and DHCP server.

I'm gonna play around with the switches to see if it could be the Netgear AP / Switch going wonky but I doubt it is. 

Anyone else having similar issues like this? The slowdowns happen even when I'm not downloading anything and the login interface is very unresponsive majority of the time. I frequently reboot it when its getting super slow. I'm running DSM 6 right now. </TEXT>

What if the United States brought back the draft but you had a choice of options for deployment depending on what age you start.

- 2 year active service military of your choice with 8 months training at age 18
- 3 years Americorps : your income level determines where you go help at, higher income go to lower income areas to help support and you live in Americorp provided group accommodations at ages 16, 17, or 18
- 3 years Peace Corps : yyour income level determines where you go help at, higher income go to lower income areas to help support and you live in Peace Corps provided group accommodations at ages 16, 17, or 18


The 3 years options should start at 16 at the earliest and that way we provide free education in exchange so all students who otherwise are not advance enough are able to go to remedial college level math classes instead of high school. I think this would save many kids from the typical bullying that high school fosters and makes them learn some empathy. While doing AmeriCorps or PeaceCorps we could even do school exchange programs with it and start allowing Foreign university credits to count in the United States as well maybe returning to the National University idea that creates universal credits for experience attained while doing each different draft or practicum experience that would mean more for jobs. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best movie theater experience for a videophile who cares about screen, sound, projector quality, and seating arrangement in Portland area </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-16 21:48:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to find the best theater for Star Wars when it comes out. I like stadium seating, wide screen, a screen that the theater makes sure is not over stretched or has runs in the material or burns in and has THX sound. Leather seats would be a perk. Also for the fact I'm not a big 3D fan but if the theater knows what they are doing they will remove the splitter which if left on lowers the brightness of a 2d movie. If you know which theaters know what they are doing for projectionists that also helps.

Any recommendations? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Takoyaki is a ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special takoyaki pan. It is typically filled with minced or diced octopus, tempura scraps, pickled ginger, and green onion.

Okonomiyaki is a Japanese savory pancake containing a variety of ingredients. The name is derived from the word okonomi, meaning "what you like" or "what you want", and yaki meaning "grilled" or "cooked".

Recommendations for places that serve both that you can vouch for would be great.

<TEXT> So we got all the information including rabies and medical records plus a photo of the dog license and driver license and contact info on the dog owner. It happened after the dog got aggressive after it saw my girlfriend dog playing with another dog. They got separated and the other owner took the dog away but 5 minutes later she unleashed it again and it came back finding my girlfriend dog who was still on a leash and attacked again. 

girlfriend had to get cast for possible fractured wrist and wounds cleaned out. Besides reporting it to Washington County Animal control which we did at the hospital and staying in contact with the attacking dog's owner for medical reimbursement once we get the ER co-pay, medication copay, and follow up visit copay bills what else should we do? Not sure we really need to go a legal avenue with this. Looked into the Oregon and Washington County Dog laws and since we have it reported with the dog license and owner contact info and information Washington County are supposed to now do an investigation. We have pictures and witness contacts as well. Anything else I should be mindful of?

My depressive swings are triggered by the winter months usually when i lived on the east coast.

But the issue is i'm moving to Portland with my girlfriend and was wondering if anyone knows about full spectrum light bulbs in helping with SAD and if they come in LED form to save money on electricity and if they do what brands are good? What frequencies of the EM Spectrum for light do I need to look for? </TEXT>

I have this ear worm stuck in my head this is a repeated notes of the song that then drops an octave and then climbs the entire scale and then repeats. I want to think its a trip hop or electronic music jazz mix thing I can't remember and it's seriously driving me batty today.

-----***EDIT****---


Found it my self I can't believe i fucked this up I knew who did it all the time It was DJ Shadow Organ Donor

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4E60Ffa9yQ

The reason i had it stuck in my head is because I heard Dizzee Rascal - Fix Up, Look Sharp

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B06gdaXJeY

Which got me to remember this song which was from Dj Hero

Fix Up Look Sharp vs Organ Donor - Dizzee Rascal vs Dj Shadow

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAUmDMMgYGY

This then had me hunting for the original song which I thought was DJ Shadow but i couldn't remember because cognitive dissidence caused by the ear worm and other music. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Is It OK to Not Pay an Intern?

Is your unpaid summer internship illegal? A breakdown of the laws on working for free.

byBlair HickmanandChristie Thompson
ProPublica, June 14, 2013, 1:05 p.m.



**What laws determine when an intern should or should not be paid?**

The Fair Labor Standards Act, or FLSA, regulates minimum wage and overtime for U.S. workers, including interns. The Department of Labors Wage and Hour Division is responsible for enforcing the law, and has asix-factor testto determine whether interns at private sector employers must be paid minimum wage.

**According to the Department of Labor, an unpaid internship must meet all these criteria:**

- The internship is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment.
- Its for the benefit of the intern
- The intern doesnt displace paid employees
- The employer doesnt benefit from work the intern is doing, and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded.
- The intern isnt promised a job at the end (unpaid tryouts arent allowed)
- Both the intern and their boss understand its an unpaid position

**So are unpaid internships ever OK?**

Very rarely, for work done at for-profit companies. According to the Department of Labor's test, companies cant derive an immediate advantage from an interns work. And in the private sector, work that doesnt benefit the company is rare.

Its fair to say most private-sector employers who employ volunteers are violating the law, said David Yamada, a professor of law at Suffolk University in Boston.

**What if they provide a stipend or lunch money? Does that count?**

Probably not, assuming its a private sector employee covered by the FLSA, according to Yamada. If an internship at a for-profit employer doesnt meet the factors laid out in the six-point test, they most likely have to pay their interns minimum wage.

**What about internships at nonprofits?**

According to the Department of Labor, nonprofits have an additional exception for unpaid interns that "volunteer their time." The government's guidelinesstate thatunpaid internships in the public sector and for non-profit charitable organizations...are generally permissible.

**What about gigs with the government?**

For most interns on Capitol Hill, its perfectly legal for them to be working for free. Congressconveniently exempted itselffrom the Fair Labor Standards Act, meaning they dont have to pay their interns. (Its just one of many workplace laws that Congress doesnt have to follow.) Mostfederal-level internships, including the White Houses program, are also unpaid.

**Does getting college credit mean its OK to not get paid?**

Not really. Many companies attempt to use academic credit as legal justification for an unpaid internships. But this weeksBlack Swan rulingsuggests college credit is not a reason to not pay your interns, a move that, as Yamada put it, opens an interesting door.

<TEXT> I'm 30 years old and disabled returning student studying at Santa Monica College and my girlfriend is 27 and works currently as a head receptionist for veterinary hospital in the Palisades. We are looking for a place or a shared apartment that takes dogs on the westside. Ghira is my girlfriend's dog that acts more like a combination cat / bunny. She is a playfully lazy sweet Husky and is spayed. She doesn't do well with small dogs as she is scaredy cat but we would have to see.

My background is I used to do IT and software training and freelance Tech journalism. I'm now going back to school studying for computer science AS to transfer for my 4 year BS. My girlfriend Alex is going back to school for grad school too. We are quite nerdy. I'm a video game guy, we both play board games, and I love to cook. We come with an apple tv, PS3, 36" HDTV and a handful of great boardgames. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [C][Homework][Extra Credit] How do you add two very large numbers using Borland 32bit compiler without using an array. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-26 03:18:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this is an extra credit assignment. I know how to do this with an array but since i'm not allowed to i'm not sure. Boreland C compiler is only 32 bit and does not support the 'long long' data type that GCC supports for 64bit applications. 

So the program is to add two numbers: 

1999999999999999999999999999999999999999999996667766999999

and

888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888

then display the total.

Again I can not use an array and I am also limited to 32bit data types.

Here is the exact text from the assignment:

 Write a complete C/Java program to add two very large numbers together as follows:
 Enter the first number
 1999999999999999999999999999999999999999999996667766999999

 Enter the second number
 888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888

 Sum is

 Display the total here
  
 Note: You should not use an array.
      


**EDIT**

Professor just clarified in an email:


There should be no limit to the number we input. Array makes it limit.

link list is the solution not an array. </TEXT>

i would be calling in the array "data[]" and a pointer to the counter that tells how many entries are in the array.

The array has 200 possible entries but as you input data it keeps a counter so if you quit entry it will let you resume entering data or start a new data set. </TEXT>

which is akin to this:

I want to print it out so it has the numbers print out like this:

           1.00       2.00       3.00       4.00       5.00

          11.00      12.00      13.00      14.00      15.00
      
       10000.00   12312.00   13212.00   12312.00   12312.00

<TEXT> So i wrote a program that while entering a while loop to enter in numbers into a array if you press Ctrl-Z, sending an EOF, it stop entry and then displays the entry of the array up to where you entered it.

Now it works fine under Windows but when I pushed Ctrl-D, which is the mac terminal / linux / bash equivalent it caused a crazy loop that just does the exit out of the loop for the while loop but keeps sending some sort of keypress that causes a menu it returns too to just circle infinitely.

<TITLE> [C][Homework] Passing pointers to sub functions and then to other sub functions. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-08 01:11:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok so i have this assignment where i need to make a Mini Statistics application in C that processes data to an array from data entered. It must keep a count of how many entries you make and then once it gets and EOF stop taking the input. It then returns you back to the home menu where you can then select to view the processed statistics from the data. It then takes you back to the home menu and then when you try to enter in data again if it see there is already data it will ask if you want to add more or start a new data set.

I'm trying to make sure i'm getting the pointer I need right to keep a counter that when the program starts initializes to count = 0 but then as it processed down to sub-functions and functions that call other functions it is passed properly so it can be counted and then minus 1 to not display the EOF entry as well as know where to display to and start reentry of data from.

if you enter in CTRL-Z or CTRL-D or the end-of-file symbol while entering in data on a line entry on your system it drops out of the data entry loop and takes you back to the main menu. I want to add a message saying "Data entry completed at line  %d," *count before the menu shows back up.

I'm not sure if i'm doing it right  though.


**I can't use structs, I'm not allowed to use gets or fgets yet. I have to do this with scanf on the inputs.**

So its pointers and arrays. 

So am I doing it right to pass the count between them and if not what am i doing wrong

my data is stored in the array data and then the MAX is a defined number for 200 entries and the counter for where it is written last to in the array for the counter is count

<DATE> 2014-10-31 20:45:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 
Ok so so I have an assignment to write a menu-driven mini-statistics package. A user should be able to enter up to 200 items of float data.

The program should calculate or show:

1. The data it self in an organized table format
1. the number of items
1. the mean
1. the standard deviation
1. the variance
1. the median
1. the mode of the data
1. The high values in the data
1. the low values in the data

When entering the data though if you enter in CTRL-Z or CTRL-D or the end-of-file symbol on your system it drops out of the data entry loop and takes you back to the main menu.

The menu options are easy enough

1. Enter data
2. Display the processed data
3. Quit program

But when you go back to enter data again it will ask you the program should also ask if you wish to add more data to your data set or create a new data set.

So I'm not sure how to do this kind of function where it stores a count of if I have already entered in data. Also i'm not quite sure how to do the End of File with the entering data into an array.

I have some pseudo code for my enterdata() function but all the rest of the code done. I'm assuming the fact that i'm calling the menu items back i use a counter with the entry to see if it had already been entered and if not then i reset the data entry counter. But i'm not fully sure.


Some advice is greatly appreciated.

I have a gist right here for it.
