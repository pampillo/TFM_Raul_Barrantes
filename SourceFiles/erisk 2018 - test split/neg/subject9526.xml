<TITLE> [Discussion] Lucio feels less impactful to play after the changes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-13 05:23:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Don't get me wrong, I think these changes are completely progressive. However, any Lucio main before these changes would tell you he is massively impactful, and nothing short of a satisfying hero to play. 

It kind of feels like I'm playing Mercy now. A Mercy who can use both her healing and pistol at the same time at the expense of them both being substantially weaker. 

His uniqueness feels kind of lost, perhaps to the much wider playerbase appeal that these changes are promoting. Some things seem to flat out counteract other things (Yeah, he's incredibly mobile now, but he has to stay inside a deathball to be of any use!)

The thing that hurts the most when I play is that speeding a teammate out of trouble (roadhog hook, D.Va ult) is basically exctinct now.

Lots of people probably feel opposed to everything I said, but I do really miss the old Lucio. There was something there that isn't anymore. Maybe it's okay that Lucio isn't for everybody. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Suggestion] Hanzo's scatter arrow should deal 40% of its base damage if it's broken against the ground </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-03 06:07:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Stairs don't count. 40% of base damage would equate to 168 damage if all arrows connect. 

I figure this would be a fair way to push some Hanzo players to become more creative with the scatter arrow. I know lots of people hate the seemingly skill-less tactic of aiming at the floor and firing for free kills. 

168 damage is still threateningly high for squishy heroes, but doesn't obliterate tanks either (No Winston main with minor chip damage likes to be instantly killed after jumping a hanzo).

This could mean scatter arrow would be used (more than it currently is) as it's described in the tutorial. I would be very hesitant to tilt if a Hanzo player used a wall or an object beside me to capitalize on full scatter arrow damage. 

What do you think? Is my percentage too low? Should we just leave scatter arrow alone? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply! I definitely figured that these specifics wouldn't have been perfectly panned out lore-wise. Although I have to say it leads to interesting speculation either way. 

I agree with Undead Settlement leading into Lothric as well. It would have been a very cool landmark before the fading fire now that I think about it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Lore] seeking clarification on the converging lands of the lords </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-10 06:59:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In Dark souls 3, we know that the lands of the Lords of Cinder converge upon Lothric castle as a result of the fading flame. However, being both relatively amateur in DS lore, and extremely nitpicky when it comes to cartography, I'm still unsure about which areas would actually have been connected before the convergence. 

For example, did the Undead Settlement run into Lothric Castle before the game's events? How about the Road of Sacrifices and Farron Keep? And then there's the Profaned Capital being directly under Irithyll (I find it strange that two very big cities would be so close together before the convergence). 

I assume Farron Keep was never actually close to the Undead Settlement due to their walls (One giant wall awkwardly running under an even more giant road lol).

I know these are lots of silly questions but I am hoping someone would be able to share the distinct difference between the areas, as well as ones related to each other.

<TITLE> A question about the master of rings achievement </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-06 02:02:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am unsure if this is true, but someone on here mentioned that you can find every ring (+0, +1, +2, +3) in Ng++.

I'm fairly confident that i missed a few +0 rings in my first playthrough, as i've moved on to Ng+ now. 

Is there a guide out there for people wanting to find all 100-something rings in Ng++? I already have a large amount of rings, but i feel that the achievement would just be easier if i quickly moved on to Ng++ and started a checklist fresh. 

This is only if I can actually find every ring on Ng++. Otherwise have i pretty much screwed myself by not finding 100% of the +0 rings on playthrough 1?

<TITLE> Is it normal to solo queue in competitive play? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-20 06:31:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am relatively new to Overwatch and I am having an extremely hard time finding a good reason to even attempt competitive.

Whenever I solo queue I basically feel like I'm gambling. And I don't like it at all. I do understand that I myself am a significant contributor to our team's strength and therefore can't entirely blame our defeats on 'terrible teammates', but I still feel as if it's very black and white regarding whether or not you will be paired with teammates that can help you score a win. 

I really am giving it my all and trying my hardest to be as valuable an asset to the team as I can, but sometimes it just doesn't work, and i can understand that. 

When I queue with even just one friend, the communication and verbal support alone is enough to improve our win rate significantly, and even climb maybe a hundred Sr in a day. This has given me the incentive to completely avoid solo queuing unless I have a friend to play with. 

I know that most people tend to initially overestimate their skill level when it comes to competitive games. However, is it even logical for me to aspire to a higher rank without some friends and communication? Or do I just not have what it takes to consistently lead five teammates to victory, no matter their performance?

Sorry for the long text, I am just hoping some can shed some light on competitive play for me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Was Lothric Castle built in part out of a huge mountain or something? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've always wondered how the castle sat on such an incredibly high landscape with relation to the surrounding mountains. At the point it's at shouldn't it be snowing up there?!

And if it was built out of an ancient mountain, I assume that the incredibly steep (and unnatural seeming) rock face that most of the kingdom sits upon could be chalked up to thousands of years of erosion or something. 

Any thoughts? Or did I miss something that was clearly explained?

<TITLE> Question about the KitchenAid BCG111 grinder... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-29 02:08:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently received this grinder as a christmas gift and i can't seem to get the right grind consistency. 

I use about 1.5 aeropress scoops of beans for a 10oz cup and the finer grinds either get stuck on the bottom of the bowl or just fly right up and out over the edge. (the lid doesn't seem to completely seal this off even when pressed down).

I held the grinder on for about 30 seconds and stopped after i noticed how much coffee was flying out of the bowl.

I am quite new to brewing my own coffee and I am excited to be grinding my own beans. Is there something i should be doing to minimize such a huge mess?


Edit: here is what was left (stuck to the bowl) after i dumped out the loose [grinds](http://imgur.com/XwA0HfO)

Is there a difference between disabling a mod and uninstalling it? Should I be just as careful when I disable my mods?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had a bad experience after installing 5 mods (Unofficial patch, Campfire, Wet and Cold, Bloody Textures, and Vivid Weathers in that load order). Initially i was really enjoying what they had to offer but i quickly found out that the draw (render) distance in my save file had taken a massive hit. It was horrendous. 

I assumed this was just a small bug, maybe a consequence of launching a save file with five new mods at once. I tried to disable my mods one at a time to find the culprit but that just ended up corrupting my modded save file entirely. 

I have reinstalled those five as well as frostfall and so far I've had no problems. But now i'm playing with a fear of another corrupted save file. I've heard of people playing with five times as many mods and having no problems whatsoever, so I am kind of pissed off that I can't have fun with a few good top rated mods. Should I be worried of another terrible render distance or corrupt save file? Is there something I can do to minimize having any problems?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was hypnotized (and put to sleep) in front of a crowd once. The way a hypnotist works is really counter-intuitive when you experience it.

The common misconception that the hypnotist is actually making people go unconscious is nonsense. The way they work is they really get into your head and make their volunteers want to participate and follow directions. When he stared into my eyes and told me promptly to "sleep!" I found myself simply under the spell of just following directions.

So I dropped to the floor (completely conscious) and acted as if I was sleeping. It's almost as if he goes into your head and says something like "Hey, we're gonna get this crowd good, so why don't you play along and we can put on a great show, okay?" 

There's also lots of other commands such as getting people to dance like crazy that can be even more entertaining. It really just boils down to the hypnotist picking who he thinks will be truly susceptible to playing along with his show. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [HoMM3] A few questions about running the HD Mod </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-17 02:08:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I bought HoMM3 Complete on gog.com and downloaded the HD mod for it. As I am playing on a laptop I feel as if it's maybe running a bit too slow for my liking, so i have a few questions about how to use the HD mod interface:

First, I have to confess that for the most part, I only got the download for it's tweaks and cool features. I actually don't mind the old graphics of the game (it has the kind of charm that the pages of a really old book have). So if there if some way to play on the original resolution (for optimal speed) but still have access to all the nice features, could someone let me know? 

As for the HD, I find that it's not too hard on my machine until I load up an XL map and start making my way towards multiple towns and heroes. That's where most of the crashing goes on. So as for now I've simply stuck to the lower resolutions while I'm playing. 

I really do love the interface and features that are displayed in the higher resolutions though. By this I mean not having to scroll through your 8 heroes, and the town display popping up as a window (two things that aren't offered at lower res). If there are any ways to speed up the gameplay while still keeping all the awesome tweaks, do let me know! </TEXT>

<TEXT> All I can recall is that the video was featured on an old teletoon show (I think it was Station X) and there were people in an industrial setting outside of some old warehouses, and there was a freaky looking old guy (I think without clothes on) who was bald and had a very creepy looking scream. There may or may not have been an old lady in the video as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 11 year old me, along with my family, were sitting at our table in Pizza Hut. Everything was going well, we had just made our order and we're quietly anticipating our food. 

Fast forward half hour and we are starting to get a little bit annoyed with how long we are being held for. We notice another family enter the restaraunt and make their order.

Fast forward another half hour, and this family is (to our disgusting shock) eating happily at their full table of food. My dad finally calls a waitress and asks what is taking so long, pointing out that another family just walked in and got their food before we were even considered. The waitress apologizes and points to the cook, saying "He must have forgotten." 

Fast forward another half hour (this is total 1:30 waiting time) and the family from earlier is paying their bill and leaving. The restaraunt was nearing empty. We were among maybe 3 other groups of customers sitting at the tables. We decide that this is a waste of time. As we were leaving, no staff gave any notice to us. My dad was furious, I could tell, but he was doing well to contain it.

As we were pulling out of the parking lot, we saw the cook that the waitress pointed to earlier, sitting on the curb beside the building having a smoke. I have never been back to Pizza Hut since. </TEXT>

Im 16 now and I own all of his buyable songs and continue to enjoy/discover his very rare music and freestyles. Without Me remains one of my favorite Eminem songs of all time. </TEXT>
