If you feel that alone and need to unload your burdens, go to a psychiatrist or confide in a SO; the people who are actually there for that kind of stuff. Don't become that melancholy friend that no-one wants to be stuck dealing with. </TEXT>

The post was originally designed for /r/malefashionadvice where the brand would have mattered, but it got taken down due to not technically asking for advice so I moved it to /r/DIY. God forbid I mention the brand name, I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty tall (6'4") and have always had a skinny frame. I get what you're saying but to counter those general gripes, these are stretch denim. I don't like tight feeling clothes but I think the look is cleaner. I could wear boxers and feel like I have room, and if I could do the splits, these pants would have no problem handling it (alas, I haven't been able to since being a hockey goalie).

Fabric selection is as important as the fit and cut. </TEXT>

I wear Levi's because they make a nice pair of jeans that fit a tall, thinner frame. If I don't have a reason to stray, aside from variety for variety's sake, I stick with what works.

Also, thanks for the bleach compliment, much appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tinder date that started at a cafe. She agreed to the date after I told her that I had cats and she started by saying she wasn't a fan, then went on a thesis-length rant about how much she hated them. I weathered the storm and she came to admire my nonchalant perseverance.

Got to the date, she goes on about her being a paralegal and how she loves debating, studied it in college, yadda yadda. She talked about living on a river and how she was nervous about her house flooding because it was close to sea level. She then told me I should be worried too because my house was at sea level 30 miles inland. Queue the bullet dodging.

I tell her she's wrong and that my house is a couple hundred feet above it. She refused to believe me, so like most people who I would think are looking to be lawyers would do (or in my case, engineers), I presented evidence supporting my hypothesis via topographical maps and multiple sources of data using the ever-so-magical Google via smartphone. I also would think that insurance companies would know better, and me not being required to have flood insurance should have been another dead giveaway that she was wrong.

Girl refused to believe me even when presented with this, proceeded to tell me she is frustrated by my idiocy and that I couldn't adequately present my side of the argument in a format that made sense to her. I figured that someone why can't process indisputable data as fact including something as stupid as my town being above sea level and then call me the idiot was no longer worth my time and left. My friends got a kick out of the whole thing afterwards, though.

TL;DR Got in an argument with a girl over my house being above sea level. Ended the date after she still called me an idiot in the face of facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Engineer who went through hell with 4 calc courses here. I found that your way of studying is pretty good, but to be effective it should be a regimen.

I would take examples that are verified complete the correct way and memorize the processes between steps. "How" and "Why" were the questions I'd ask. If you understand the steps, you can apply them to any question.

It's a more efficient way of studying. You can really focus on two or three questions and their concepts rather than going through endless examples and hoping it sticks via repetition. </TEXT>

The point was it's not a death sentence to have a child there. It was an eye opening experience that none of us regret. It's a safe, friendly school like any other would be. I only hope the rest of the schools can get funding to catch up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Girlfriend and I had her daughter in DPS for a year; second grade at Burton International Academy. 

Everyone there was friendly and helpful. The class size was around 20/room, she had a bus that picked her up downtown, the after school programs were great. Her teacher was available 24/7 via call or text. The homework was consistent and challenging enough that when she moved over to Ann Arbor this year, she was well ahead in math and reading while on par with writing.

The after school programs included a full on Wizard of Oz musical with a few of the grades tied together. It was honestly amazing; they really got her to sing her heart out. The schools also had a weekend soccer program put on by volunteers in Southwest that was a ton of fun.

The school itself was somewhat of an issue; they had no A/C and you could tell that most supplies were pretty old. There are lots of companies that donate tons of supplies, backpacks, winter jackets, etc. to all of the kids, which was nice.

We did have an opportunity to hand pick our school. Burton has a solid reputation and after meeting the staff we could tell that they really cared about succeeding. Also taking into account that the state will partially fund colleges if you come out of DPS and it's not a bad set-up. The care is there, but the funding is what's really hurting them. </TEXT>

However, if you're talking true high rises and me having no understanding of your budget, downtown Detroit is pretty awesome (source: lived in a 25th floor high rise there for 4 years).

<TEXT> Hearing that the gym is a solution relating to posture as one of the top answers is mind boggling to me...Here's what I did.

I went through a regimen to try and be with the in-crowd moving from high school (where I was generally considered a typical dork) to college. This included perfecting a signature, facial expressions, developing a fashionable pallet of clothing, and yes, posture.

I paid attention to people who I thought exuded confidence and mimicked them. Everything from:

 -Walking with my hands slightly closed with knuckles facing forward rather than sideways,

-Exaggerating my weak (right) arm movement to go with my strong foot,

 -Concentrating on not looking at the ground when I walked which forces your head up,

-Breathing through your upper chest while keeping your stomach stationary to naturally square your shoulders,

-and standing taller by pushing my shoulders back (but not over-exaggerating).

Turns out that worked very well. I'm currently in a very public sales position, I've had my run with beautiful women who have told me specifically that they admire my confidence, and I did all of this without spending a single damn day in the gym.

For what it's worth, I'm a scrawny 6'4" bean pole. Basically exactly the same as I was in high school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> De Casa La Habana is a top notch B M downtown. Used to live within walking distance, and frequented that spot on Friday and Saturday nights for the live jazz.

If you're looking reasonably upscale restaurant wise, I'd recommend 24grille. Everyone loves it's brother restaurant Roast, but the people who live in the Westin know where the real spot is.

Grand Trunk is a spot where actual Detroiters like to hang out, and they have a pretty great Michigan beer selection as well.

Mercury Bar has, in my humble opinion, the best burgers in the city (if you're interested in something like that).

Thomas Magees in Eastern Market is my favorite sports bar (the owner Erik is a good dude and a friend of mine), and Stache International next door makes the best bologna--yes, bologna--sandwich you'll ever have. I'd recommend walking the market on a Saturday or Sunday morning. It's the biggest open market in the world, for what it's worth.

The DIA is that second largest museum collection in the world. It's pretty fascinating and worth at least a quick walkthrough for 5 bucks or so.

Feel free to ask if you're looking for anything in particular. I've lived there for four years now and I'd like to think I can point you in the right direction for pretty much anything.

<TEXT> A combo shampoo and conditioner is not good for your hair. Buy separate products.

Wrinkled clothes can be unwrinkled using a mist spray bottle of water.

Pickles are given with meals to eat after your dish to freshen your breath. Eat them last.

Don't wash pants after every wear. Once every 3 months is probably acceptable. Your pants will last longer and look newer (this might be anti hygiene but I'm throwing it out there).

Lemon or lime will get rid of smoke breath.

Use a lufa. They exfoliate.

Wash your whites separate with bleach. Unfortunately, this isn't common knowledge.

When shaving pubes, use a dull razor that your used on your face. This will help avoid cuts and razor bumps.

I'll think of more as they come to me... </TEXT>

Main factors to look at in an injection mold issue: cycle time, temperature, and material. It sounds like you run different materials through the same mold and they function fine, so I'd look at the operating temperature of the material personally. It could be sticking to the mold if it's running hot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. How does your weight feel on your feet? You're standing pretty tall. Alternatively, you could choke a little further down on the grip and get more of a stance over the ball. This should help with balance and assist in correcting your takeaway by keeping your arms in at the same time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When lining up with the ball, the position between your feet is different depending on whether it's a wood or an iron/wedge.

The ball should line up with the inside of your front foot if you're hitting a wood to allow the clubface to contact the ball with an upward motion (also when you tee up the ball with a wood, the standard height is having the middle of the ball halfway over the head of the club when it's resting on the ground). 

When hitting an iron/wedge, the ball should be positioned in the center of your stance.

This is pretty basic, but if your stance isn't correct it's going to make getting proper contact extremely difficult. Hopefully this helps. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I began using a technique that has really helped me in keeping my face closed on the follow-through and getting the distance correct. To start, the human brain can register the distance and location to a hole for around 5-7 seconds after you look away. Be extra cognizant of the location and take a few practice putting strokes. Take a long look at the hole before you look down and address the ball. Next, when you hit it, make sure to keep your head looking directly where the ball was before you did so for an extra two seconds. This ensures you don't peek and open the face before your club impacts the ball. This is vital to ensuring a proper line and I have found this to be a massive help.

To go along with practice, make sure you have the right style of putter. I personally feel that there are two types of putting styles, the "tempo" (mallet) putter and the "feel" (blade) putter. 

I started with a mallet putter and for the life of me I couldn't drop anything outside of 5 feet. My putting stroke felt inconsistent and I just couldn't seem to get distances correct no matter how much I practiced.

Enter the blade putter. I ended up at the local golf shop putting for an hour or so during my lunch breaks trying to figure out if there was something that a different putter could give me. Picked up the blade putter and the feel through the putting stroke was fantastic. I  was getting close or dropping everything. Turns out that my putting style was completely mismatched with my putter and I have been great at it since. Just something to chew on... </TEXT>

High school educated managing a sales account for a sustainable energy supplier. Grew up in Memphis, Michigan (a very country setting), is married with five children, and has a very conservative viewpoint.

Joe cannot stop expressing his hatred for Obama, Hillary, Bernie, and anything liberal on Facebook every single day, multiple times a day. We all have people like Joe (in the US, anyway). I decided that I would say something to him about one of his posts after scrolling through them for about 6 months. 

Needless to say, I have over 100 of them to share since December. We both enjoy getting the last word which leads to some long and sometimes heated conversations, and Id like to think that they make for good entertainment. I hope you enjoy!


DISCLAIMER: Looking back on some of the things I said, I could have phrased a few items differently. There are probably some mitigating factors in there (coughbeerscough) so I apologize if some of the things I say can come off as harsh. I will do my best to explain them in the albums as they are posted.

Thank you for taking a look, any feedback is always welcomed.

Regards,

-Joe's nephew Mitch

<TEXT> Summary: Expandable storage will not be integrated with internal storage (a standard Marshmallow feature) because:

Samsung says their decision came down to customer confusion, they dont want people pulling out the microSD card while its being used for adoptable storage and potentially making a mess of things.

What really grinds my gears:

How can Samsung not trust their users enough to not screw up simple expandable storage at this cost of a terrible system flaw that can be avoided if they thought we had a couple of brain cells? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of things:

-Pay off the collections immediately. These are the biggest factor in your score at the moment.

-After paying these off, your score should rise enough to get some low-end credit cards (do not get retail cards; real credit cards). By paying off your collections first, your score will reflect that you are of less risk than before paying them off. This will get your better rates and better limits. Don't get cards with an annual fee and shoot for ones that have a graduated credit limit increase with timely payments.

-Ensure that you acquire a couple of cards and use them for a trivial purchase monthly in order to ensure that the cards are reflected on your report. Pay these off in full every month (shouldn't be difficult if you really stick to the "trivial" aspect of it).

-Get a credit score tracker of some type (preferably a FICO score tracker, though the Credit Karma VantageScore is a decent model). Most come with a simulator of some sort which can give you guidance into how to best raise your score.

Personally, I have found that Capital One has some great cards and tools for recovering credit scores, including graduated rates, a tracker, and a simulator. My score has jumped over 100 points in a year coming from a similar situation and I am looking to buy a house myself.

Hopefully this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my case, it involved critically thinking about every step. It wasn't "Oh, I got the right answer for this step so I'll go on to the next part". It was "Why did I get the right answer for this step, how does it relate to the next step, what are the signs from the previous step that I should be using the method I just used?" and so on. Focusing on the actual comprehension rather than the answer was key.

I had massive personal issues in college as well. It's important to not have that at the front of your mind or you have very little chance of absorbing additional information. I taught myself to leave my issues at the door when it was test time. I think that's where the music helped with studying; it was enough to keep my mind from wandering without being distracting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Engineering grad here; I had the same issue. Never studied, never did homework, walked in and aced every test in high school. College was a shock to my system that almost had me dropped due to poor grades. I had to actually develop a strategy to study.

Turns out that I studied best locked in my room with ambient music playing. I refused to leave until I learned the material. I generally did this by following proper techniques line for line until I learned the methods rather than reciting exact problems. I would get a half hour TV break every couple hours to keep my sanity.

Developing a study routine is the only way you're going to get there. You need to figure out what works best for you in order to succeed. If you were like me, this will be incredibly difficult but it gets easier once you "get in a groove" so to speak. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I can drink Steel Reserve now. I love all beers, though I have moved on to a higher quality of booze. I only drink Steel Reserve now when I see the roommates, for nostalgia sake.

The cans were in garbage bags. I washed them all out when finished as to not make the whole apartment smell like fermented malt liquor.

I functioned fine during those 3 weeks. I was steadily drinking them throughout the day to avoid getting ridiculous for class (weekends not included).

I graduated on time with my intended BSME degree, so no regrets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, sounds like you're going to need to find a roommate. That's a pretty tight budget to find anything reasonable. After living downtown a couple of years and spending tons of time watching the cost of rent for a single bedroom or studio (I pay too much at $1215 a month with no included utilities and I know it), the "starter" value for a one bedroom/studio in that area is closer to $850/month.

As /u/filipinohitman suggested, finding a spot in Woodbridge would probably be a more realistic bet. Great area and a renter community. </TEXT>

d and p are a reflection of b and q, not a rotation; pending we are referencing it in the correct context of actual usage.

<TEXT> This exact same situation happened to me as well (grand opening weekend). I went in to check it out, got one beer at the bar. Though I was the only person sitting at the bar at the time, the bartenders repeatedly walked past my empty glass without asking if I could use another. After a half hour of no offer for a refill (I could have asked, I know, but I was in the mood to see how long it would take; so sue me), I was told that I had to cash out and leave because there was a private event about to begin.

I went back the next day with my girlfriend hoping to get a more positive and lengthy experience, and was told that it was booked all day again for a private event.

They should have opened to the public the weekend after their private events; I can't depend on this place being open when I'm looking for a spot to eat/drink. Why would I want to make plans with people from out of town (for instance) to meet there only to have it closed to the general public?

This place needs to clean up its act. I'd give it another month once the new hires are broken in and the initial crowd wears down, then maybe it'll have a chance to be a solid spot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For context, I'm 28 years old.

I ask myself this question: "When I'm a grandfather and sitting around a campfire with my grandkids, would I have anything interesting from my life to tell them?"

I live my life by this mantra. I look for new ways to get outside of my comfort zone, live in the moment, etc. constantly. Honestly, living this way has given me many great stories to tell about my life. 

I had a good friend who has traveled the world, works in Detroit politics, can captivate a room with his words, and seemingly has seen it all tell a group of his friends, "I have stories; but subject5813? That guy has some REAL stories". It was a sign to me that I have been trending in the right direction.

But for now, through all the heartache and mistakes, struggles and successes, the horrible and the wonderful; the love, friendships, and experiences I've had would make me say that I am, in fact, satisfied and fulfilled with my life to this point. </TEXT>

Also, don't but that 2-in-1 shampoo conditioner crap. They should be completely separated. Same process with the conditioner as the shampoo.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in downtown Detroit. I love the city and can give you some first hand tips and recommendations. I'll try my best here.

-Detroiters don't like Greektown. It's safe for out of towners, but the bums and beggars know that that's where the surbanites and tourists go. Part of the bad rep of the city comes from that entire experience alone. If you want some legitimate Detroit goodness, here are my recommendations:

-Park Bar: Great atmosphere, excellent location relative to Ford Field. Great Mediterranean food, if you're into that sort of thing. Excellent beer selection.

-Foran's Grand Trunk Pub: One of my favorite spots, and is more of a localized gem as opposed to an out-of-town haven. They have a ton (a TON) of Michigan brews, excellent game day specials, and great food. The bar has a legitimate old school feel to it, and is only a couple blocks to the game. Good access point between the field and the river (the river walked has been completely revamped and is quite pleasant).

-Bookie's Bar and Grille: Nice double decker building with a patio on the rooftop. A free bus to the game. A few pretty good beers, solid prices as well. A little off the beaten path per se, but still downtown. I walk there from my place frequently.

-Mercury Bar/Slows: Obligatory tourist destination (Slows specifically). I don't frequent it often because of this, but the food always seems to get fantastic reviews, even on a national level. I'd expect a near hour wait here though, so plan accordingly if you decide to go here.

Fancier options include 24grille (great wine selection, little unknown high end restaurant/bar in the Westin Book Cadillac, along with another bigger one called Roast, which I feel is overrated), London Chop house (has a cigar bar, if that's your cup of tea), and Texas De Brazil (every cut of meat you can think of).

Things to do:

-Walk the river, it really is nice.

-Visit Campus Martius right smack dab in the middle of the city. There is always something going on there.

-Get a famous coney dog at American or Lafayette (Lafayette FTW).

-Hit up a casino. Greektown feels like gambling in my parents basement. I would advise Motor City if you wanted to see some over the top style.

-Do touristy things. There are small niche shops all over the place. There's always some quirky items at any of these locations. Walk as much as you can; it's not dangerous, I promise.

-Go bar hopping in Corktown. You can snag a bus to the game from there if you choose that as your destination before the game as well.

Well, that's what I got. Hope it helps some. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Areas to live: Corktown, Hamtramck, Woodbridge, Downtown, Indian Village (if you have that kind of cash), New Center, and Boston Edison.

News: Deadline Detroit, Detroit News, Detroit Free Press, Metro Times, Motor City Muckraker, Preservation Detroit, MLive

Climate: Living here all my life, the winters are cold and the summers are hot. I love that I can own both a snowboard and golf clubs in this state. Detroit was rated the country's safest city based on natural disasters; the lakes help keep them away. The summers average around 85 degrees, the winters hover around 10 degrees or so. To put it one way: you will never be bored climate-wise.

Jobs: I am an engineer and have companies begging me to talk to them. I make six figures and I'm not out of my mid twenties. It depends on your degree, of course, and unfortunately I can't give great information on liberal arts jobs, but there are plenty of other small time jobs all over the city.

All in all, I love it here and have no desire to ever live elsewhere. The people are friendly, the city is in a progressive transformation, and loyalty to the city is fierce. I'd defend Detroit to my grave. Good luck on your decision.

EDIT: Realized I titled one of the districts incorrectly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Metropolitan and city are not one in the same. After the era of white flight, population in the city had declined test over year for a long period of time. The city is under 700k residency for the first time since the 50s, with the square mileage to fit NYC and LA within it's limits combined. The lack of many tall buildings is also due to the gothic architecture of the time which didn't allow for extreme heights when the city was becoming industrialized. So tl;dl Toronto is much bigger and newer at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a theory that he was left off so Klinsmann could evaluate and give experience to the younger players in "the group of death" because they realistically don't have a chance to advance. That way, when the next cup comes around those players will have experience and will make for a much better shot in 2020 where Donovan will absolutely not be playing in. Keep in mind that Klinsmann just received a 4 year extension, so he has no reason to "win now". His real evaluation will be the next WC, not this one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By looking at the construction of a spoke in a wheel, the correct answer absolutely is the top spokes. The inner rivets along the rims are only held in place by the spoke being screwed in, thus pulling it snug to the rim wall. There is nothing preventing it from moving it towards the tire tube.

<TEXT> Use paint stripper and 100 grit to get all of the rust and paint off. Then sand using 600-800 grit until the hood is smooth. Next, ensure that your paint area is tarped off. 

Use 2-3 coats of primer, wet sanding with 800-1000 grit in between. If you really want to use spraypaint, I used a $5 Bondo gun attachment for my bike project and it worked like a charm. Proper method is ensuring that the paint is applied in parallel directions in light coats, and that the gun never stops moving while spraying (spray in "strokes").

The most critical part is making sure that you are not impatient between coats, and if there is a run make sure to let it dry and sand that spot down to level. I'd recommend 1-2 hours in between coats with the primer, and a day per coat between paint, all the while sanding in between each coat.

Again, patience is key, and it is possible to make it look good if you keep that in mind. A good paint job should take around 3-4 days. </TEXT>

Underrated food establishments that are legitimately in Detroit:

Detroit Beer Company - Very good bar food to accompany great beer

Louie's Lounge - Just opened 2 weeks ago, phenomenal food hand delivered by the chef

Foran's Grand Trunk Pub - Best brunch in the city, bottomless Bloody Mary's are excellent

Traffic Light - Well-made food

Greenwich Tavern - Hole in the wall with decent food but prices that are straight out of the 1950's

Town Pump Tavern - One of the more underrated burgers in town

24grille - One of only two places that has ever made food that makes the hair on my neck stand up. A little pricey but worth it.

Anyone else with favorite legit Detroit spots?

<TEXT> This bike had a lot of sentimental value to me. It has been in my family for nearly 30 years and I grew up riding it. Money can't put a price on it.

From what I understand as well, older Schwinn's were high quality bikes. I don't know what other beat up bike that was free and readily available could show more promise.

I appreciate the compliment looks-wise, and I can understand your opinion about the bike itself. Thanks for taking a look. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I had a space that wasn't my apartment and proper tools, I'd definitely consider it. 

I'm not sure, I haven't checked the market yet, but my dad told me the backstory on how he got this one, which I found amusing. Apparently he found it chained to a fence in a random front yard for sale. He bought it for 20 bucks sometime in the 80's.

This was the bike I grew up riding and abusing as a kid, so it has some sentimental value to me. That and the "hip" custom bike culture in Detroit is fascinating. I felt that fixing this one up was a win-win. 

I don't have the energy at this point to do another one, but I may as my biking experience evolves. Thanks for your kind comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bikes are simpler than they look, to be honest. The "clutch", or as many fellow redditors have pointed out to me, the derailleur was two bolts, one utilized by the rear wheel and the other attached to a spacer-type nut in the frame. 

The brake lines were one screw each line. The assembly of the brake lines is more difficult than the disassembly, but it's fun to calibrate them to your comfort level with the throw on the levers once you get the hang of it.

Thanks for looking, and it was definitely fun! </TEXT>

<TEXT> First joker on the thread. There's always one.

I was meticulous in ensuring the actual apartment was not damaged in the process.Abuses his apartment lease to overhaul a bicycle = check.

I was careful to ensure the apartment was not damaged during the process.

Primary residence in a inconvenient high rise = check.

"Inconvenient" is in the eye of the beholder. I can walk or ride to anything I need, what's inconvenient about it? 

Uses cigars and alcohol to try and be cool = check.

People celebrate in their own ways. My picture was selected by Cigar Aficionado magazine for use, if that is any consolation.

Crappy full tower attached to TV = check.

Haven't bought a tower that suits my tastes yet. Maybe I should build one.

Lots of couch space, no friends = check.

I didn't realize that couches had to always be occupied. Do you work on projects when your friends are over? Pretty rude, in my opinion.

Crappy rectangle shower = check.

It's an apartment, not the Westin Book Cadillac...didn't really have much of a choice.

Crappy shoes = check.

I get compliments on my Pumas all the time. Didn't know I was in /r/malefashionadvice.

Crappy pinstriping = check.

To each their own. What did you do during your bike project? 

what'd I miss?

I think we know why his ex left him, now.

Well, I'm just glad my ex wasn't my right hand. Hope you and Ms. Right are happy for a long time.

Thanks for looking.

It wasn't necessarily the cushion that drew me to that seat as much as it was the style.

<TEXT> The new parts I bought were the seat, brake/gear cables and tubing, and a new chain because the other one was unsalvageable due to rust and corrosion, new tires and tubes, aside from the brake pads. Other than that all parts were refurbished.

I didn't use a single guide when doing this rebuild, I just used my mechanical and amateur painting experiences to rough my way through it. The guys at my nearby bike shop came in handy whenever I had a question (essentially my consultants). Their eagerness to see the bike helped push me when I felt I needed it, so it's nice to have that rapport.

If you have any specific questions, feel free to PM me. Good luck on your bike! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hah, thanks for the feedback. I went into the build completely blind. I didn't want to damage the knurls, so I went with the rubber oil filter wrench. 

I inspected each bearing assembly, cleaned, and re-greased each set. The bearings were in good shape, so they didn't need to be re-packed (I've repacked on cars when they get bad, this was not the case, fortunately).

Other additional items I will be getting are a front reflector/headlight and new handlebar grips, but she's done otherwise. 

I'm looking forward to some city cruising/slow roll events! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way to keep an open mind is to consciously make an attempt to not compare anyone new to the ex. Force yourself to focus on unique characteristics of a new person that attract you to them and realize that in order to find someone you will want to get in a relationship with, it is going to take time to develop feelings for that person.

The problem with comparing anyone to an ex is they have known their ex for a long period of time. They had become a normality in your life, and change is always difficult. Treat meeting new people as more of an adventure and don't get lost in setting metrics for them; you will get much more enjoyment out of it. </TEXT>

I've seen my friends make the mistake of putting their exes on a pedestal when they are trying to date, and that mental block is what keeps them from getting into another relationship. Do everything in your power to keep an open mind; everyone is unique. It didn't work for some reason, so don't go looking for the same things when you're getting back on the horse, so to speak. Just another friendly word of advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Hundreds of thousands" is a pretty big exaggeration. I went to the best mechanical engineering school in America for 5 years and didn't even reach 100k in student loan debt.

Also, going to college to get a degree in an area with no realistic expectation for a job can be expected is most likely exactly what 1/3 of the people who go, do. Essentially college has turned into a social norm, so people feel obligated to go. Generally, these people go to community college, rack up 20k or so in debt, then drop out. People in the case that you're outlining is a very, very small minority.

It's about making the most out of your abilities, whether that is through trade or college. The best advice is if you don't have an idea of what you want to do, don't go until you figure it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I moved to Detroit 6 months ago; best decision of my life. 

I grew up in comfortable/rich suburbia, got a BSME at the number one rated college for mechanical engineering (Kettering University) and got a great job in the industry. I just got bored and tired of driving, so I moved downtown.

The people here are amazingly friendly and there is so much to do that for a person such as myself that can't stand to be idle I am loving every second.

<TEXT> "That I was manipulative, selfish, and dishonest. She was right, for the record."

This is exactly what all of my exes would say, and just like you they would not be incorrect. My current girlfriend doesn't trust me and the last two dumped me because I went through great lengths to hide certain things. I don't blame them at all.

My biggest issue is I am utterly selfish. I had my heart broken by my first girlfriend and decided at that point to essentially shut out all feelings. However, my last girlfriend made great progress in getting me out of that hole, unfortunately she was the sacrifice girlfriend considering our relationship was unrepairable while going through my process of emotional evolution.

My new girlfriend and I are happy, and I figured out a way to control myself: If I think about being with someone else, I imagine what their reaction would be if they were in the same room. Literally imagining breaking the heart of the person I love is enough for me to control myself.

TLDR: I was a terrible person but changed via an intense relationship and self-evaluation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why is this surprising to anyone? Windows 8 is an entirely different OS compared to Windows 7. A majority of machines are not optimized to handle Windows 8, IE no touch screen. Windows 8 is beautifully fluid with one, but is very clunky and odd without one.

Nobody wants to run a new OS and only grasp half of its features. Therefore, rather than simply upgrading older computers like was done with Windows 7, people have to go out and buy all new computers to truly experience Windows 8.

I fully expect that Windows 8 will catch on once older machines are replaced, but since 7 support is still strong, this will not happen for awhile. I don't see what the surprise is as far as these sales figures are concerned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know a friend who went through the probation system for a DUI/assaulting a police officer. He learned a valuable lesson about driving while intoxicated (havent done since and will never do again), but he still liked to enjoy an occasional beverage.

Note that I understand that every probation/person is different but this advice applies to people who got caught in the wrong place and the wrong time more so than the person who really needs to use these probation terms as a guide away from alcoholism.

Here is the summation of his experiences:

Terms of probation:
-Random alcohol tests
-Outpatient counseling
-Alcoholics Anonymous bi-weekly
-1 year minimum license suspension, with evaluation for reinstatement after suspension

Alcohol tests: If you still want to drink, buy yourself a breathalyzer.  This is the one I use to this day; it attaches to my keychain and is very accurate (BACtrack). Make sure that you subtract 2 hours per .015 BAC from the time you are scheduled to test. You will blow a .00 every time. Not really a lie, but advice on how to avoid something idiotic.

Counseling: Always claim that you have been sober since the court can last prove you drank (IE the date of your incident). Talk about your hobbies and how you dont hang out with the same people that you got in trouble with. You will have to keep this up for a couple of sessions until you are determined to be low risk and released. This assessment plays a big role in getting your license back, if need be.

AA: This is the biggest farce of the entire system. Probation officers collect evidence of attendance by having you keep a sign in sheet; a piece of paper signed by a random member at AA. The courts are not allowed to confirm any of the participants on your sign in sheet exist in any manner, as it is Anonymous. Go to one meeting to see how things are ran, and fill in the rest of the sheet yourself with fake names and fake phone numbers. Again, the courts legally cannot check these.

License hearing: Never admit to drinking, dont bother to learn the 12 steps or Serenity Prayer and claim lack of participation on being agnostic/atheist and only going to the meetings due to court order. Memorize the date of your initial incident and state that this is the last day you had alcohol. Stick to that gun and you dont even need a lawyer, pending you filed the paperwork correctly.

This is the fastest and simplest way through a probationary period.

<TEXT> To clarify, what I am essentially saying is posting an electronic transaction to pay for your credit card. Most credit cards are paid via EBT, not a check (unless you write one, in that case this doesn't help). Credit card payments are posted regardless of your overdraw settings on your bank account. This way you can use your credit card until you get paid, at which point your account goes positive (hopefully!). Thus the only penalties associated with this are the (usually $32) overdraft fee, rather than the mounds of interest you would need to pay back on a payday loan. As a former just-college graduate and intern, this method saved me hundreds of dollars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The good part about this method is that not only are you not getting a payday loan, but you are also making a payment on a credit card, thus avoiding extra fees on the card at the same time. It's a win-win versus getting a loan with a ridiculous interest rate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regulate the cost of college tuition. This will be the next biggest bubble to burst. Without regulation, there is no money for the entry level working class generation to spend on the economy. They can't afford houses, cars, etc. There's a reason the median age to live at home with the parents has increased to over 25 in the US: people can't afford to leave. I myself have a great job coming from an excellent institution, but am saddled with approximately $80k in student loan debt, equating to around $800 a month out of my paychecks. The scary thing is, I'm not nearly the worst of my friends in that regard. There is now a terrible decision that every high school graduate must make, and that's "don't go to college and never get a good job" or "go to college and be stuck slaving for 15+ years to pay off said education"? I calculated that at my current salary with student loans versus a McDonald's manager straight out of high school, it will take me until I'm 35 to break even (just break even!) with that person's earnings. Something isn't right there, and it needs to be fixed to straighten out this economy. Just a word of advice, I had some German exchange student friends that gushed about their education system; I'd look into that if you want to find a reasonable solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lost a championship hockey game and was driving back home. Car pulls up behind me and starts tailgating me on the freeway. I was pissed and sped up well past the speed limit; he does the same. At this point I'm doing 40 over. We drive under an overhead light and I see that there is a light bar on top of the car...."shit", I say.

Cop pulls me over, walks up to my window, and says, "you had no idea I was a cop, did you?" 
"No sir", I say.
"Do you know why I pulled you over?", he asks.
"Because I'm fucking retarded", I tell him.
"Oh? You're fucking retarded eh?", he replies.
"Yep, fucking retarded."

He laughs, then proceeds to write me up for the full 40 over. Not exactly a funny story for me, but hopefully there is entertainment value in my misery. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Night was Worse than Yours. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-27 17:08:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What you're about to read is the summation of my night. I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried:

 Walked half way down Woodward to meet up with friends, realized I forgot my wallet. Walked all the way back and up 25 flights to my apartment only to realize it wasn't in there. Had to go all the way back down to my car to get it, where I found it sitting in the front seat...minor inconvenience.

 Get back later and I'm watching TV on the couch. my phone slides off into the cushion in the most perfect spot, I can't grab it and it won't come loose. I even flip the couch and shake it in an attempt to jar it out, but to no avail. I finally get down in there and catch a corner of it and pull it out, in the process jamming the power button into the bezel so the phone just keeps turning on and off over and over...major inconvenience, but not the worst of it.

 Now the fun begins. I go to get a glass of water. I pull the knob up and what happens? Said knob shoots right off the faucet. Now water is spraying like Niagara Falls all over my kitchen. The knob was perfectly deposited into the food disposal drain like Dan Marino throwing a touchdown pass, so I can't find it.

 Meanwhile, I go to quickly move all of the stuff getting showered on via the fire hose exploding from my sink. I'm in about an inch of water at this point. I pick up my toaster, and it promptly electrocutes me, which feels something like I would imagine an electric chair would feel like.

 So here I am, freshly shocked and covered in a monsoon of water. I open the cupboard below and turn the cold valve off, then go for the hot valve. By golly, to my total surprise (sarcasm...emphasis on the sarcasm) the valve is jammed and will not turn.

 So now I have boiling water shooting all over the place like a hot spring geyser. My being the Hercules that I am, I grab a towel and twist as hard as I could on the valve. What gives first instead? The pipe fitting. Fantastiballs!

 Good thing at this point I notice that there is a flex pipe that I gained some slack in while wrenching on the pipe like the Jaws of Life tearing through a vehicle. I pinch it and Mt. Kilimanjaro finally stops. 

 Now I'm stuck sitting in said water with nothing to tie the pinch off with...fantastic. I dig around blindly in the junk drawer right next to my sink, and promptly shred my hand like it was against a cheese grater against every sharp object ever. My eventual savior? A banana clip given to me as a white elephant gift. I don't know why I kept it, I don't even eat bananas! I clip it on and finally, crisis averted.

 It's now 4 in the morning and I have Lake Huron in my kitchen. It took me four full sized bath towels and an hour and a half to sop all of the water up.

 Quick summary: Odd string of bad luck led to no sleep. Needless to say, I will be out all afternoon like Mayweather punched me in the face while holding a dumbbell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I currently live in Detroit as a 27 year old program manager of all accounts for a local automotive OEM; let me also clarify that I am white... I have grown up in the area my whole life. I love Detroit and would never want to live anywhere else. 

Here is the current status of the city as I see it:
-Everyone wants to talk about how Detroit is bankrupt. While true, the reasons are because of the sheer square mileage. It's 139 square miles, which is one of the biggest in the nation.

-Because of the sheer massive size, there are not enough resources to keep all parts of the city fully functioning. There are, of course, many dangerous areas of the city that you always hear about on the news, but what gets largely overlooked is the progress and what it means. Let me clarify below.

-There are beautiful areas of this city. I currently live downtown, which has a 100% residential occupancy rate. The core of the tenants in this area are one of the highest percentages of 21 to 30 year olds in the nation. A vast amount work for Dan Gilbert, the owner of Quicken Loans who decided to base his headquarters here.

-Speaking of Dan Gilbert, he is the sole reason that the downtown area is flourishing. He buys real estate and evicts it's old tenants, remodels the building, then sells his newly remodeled buildings at premium prices. This is how he has been able to gentrify the core of the city.

-With this new core, there are signs that this is moving outward throughout the city. Midtown is now at 99% occupancy with this happening in a similar manner as downtown. Corktown (home of the world-famous Slow's Barbecue) is next after a fierce bidding war last month.

-The reason for all of this activity is because Detroit is slowly once again becoming a desirable place to live, despite the reports that are often shown regarding it being like a "war zone". The media has completely blown that out of proportion, which is a shame.

I run a twitter account regarding the positive aspects of Detroit, but refuse to shamelessly promote it, which would effectively ruin the credibility of this post. I wouldn't live anywhere else, that's the honest truth. It's a shame that the focus isn't on the city's revival but instead on it's past. I'd love to get into further detail if anyone so cares. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stumbled home from a work party and proceeded to lock myself in my water heater closet at my apartment; I couldn't see a damn thing. In my drunken stupor, I kicked the pipe at the bottom and busted it off the heater, which proceeded to start filling said closet with scalding hot water. At this point the drunken panic sets in: I find the door and push the handle and it won't budge. I begin to think I'm going to die as the scalding water and steam start to fill this 4' x 4' closet, so in my state of drunken adrenaline I grab the heater, rip it off the pipes, and start ramming the door in hopes that it would open. In realizing it won't and thinking I'm going to die, I lay against the wall in defeat. I turn the handle one more time with tears streaming down my face...I pull the handle and it opens without a problem. When I was trying to open said door the first time, I tried pushing only...$2,000 and an eviction notice later, still the dumbest (and weirdest) thing I've done while drunk. </TEXT>
