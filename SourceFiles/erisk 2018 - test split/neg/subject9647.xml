<TEXT> I'm in a longterm, live-in relationship with my boyfriend. He and I are in a DD/LG relationship, and it's my first real experience in any kind of definite D/S relationship. I feel so comfortable and happy as a sub, but sometimes letting Daddy fuck my face as a special treat gets very...monotonous. I love it, and I'm great at it, but I just wish there were more things I could do to surprise him and serve him. I'd love to be able to keep him guessing. Any advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes!! Ask for items they don't have if employees bug you. I usually ask where their Kat Von D makeup is.  if a palette has a sensor, it's usually an RFID sticker and you can see it on the outside. Just peel it off. Be careful about ditching packages because they'll eventually catch onto you. But I have a big purse, so I just take the de-tagged palettes to my blind spot and I look at items on a low shelf and slide the palettes into my purse.

Ulta LP is regional and is only in certain stores a few times a year. But look out for the manager. Ulta managers usually leave kinda early so I'd advise hitting them later in the day, like after 7:00. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Magic of Purses </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-27 03:47:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Purses make lifting so much fucking easier than you can imagine. Sometimes I feel like I have a bag like Mary Poppins.  No one suspects a thing when a woman goes into a store with a huge, slouchy purse slung over her shoulder. My purse has a crossbody strap that frees up both my hands and makes things even easier. As long as you're confident, you can slip small items into your bag without even being in a blind spot. Just keep walking and looking forward, not down at your hands or up at the ceiling trying to find cameras. I have grown a lot in my lifting skills and one of the best things to do in your blind spot is just take the items and fucking drop them in your purse. You can't even hesitate for a second, and it should be one quick, smooth movement. That's the key to success.

Fuck, I love my purse... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have mad respect for you. You seem very reasonable and like a stand-up, decent human being. The few AP I've encountered (especially at Target) are so fucking rude and act like lifters are animals, even those (like myself) who lift out of necessity.

My question is, what would an announcement over the intercom for LP sound like? Do they do that at Target?

Also, what would you consider the best method for lifting at Target? Using the reusable shopping bags? I've done a few push-outs with food and groceries but I feel like this is a dangerous method since every once in a while I see an APS at the door checking receipts. </TEXT>

I doubled over and grabbed my stomach and was panicking to my boyfriend that I couldn't stop laughing and asked if I would ever stop before my stomach exploded.

I also asked my boyfriend "Was Justin Timberlake in blink-182? ...fuck, I meant N*SYNC. I want garlic bread."

I've also started laughing, then once I forget why I stop laughing and then immediately start back up again after realizing that I looked so silly. A never ending cycle. Lmao. </TEXT>

I grab items quickly, hold them under my arm and take them to a fitting room near the mall exit. Fitting rooms aren't monitored so I take my items in with some clothes to "try on", take the RFID tags off the makeup, stick them to the back of the mirror so no one can see, and put the makeup in my bag, then hang the clothes up. I left once with two Modern Renaissance palettes (one for me and one to resell), a NARS foundation and concealer, 3 beauty blenders, and the Sweet Peach Palette.

Eyeshadow palettes usually have sensors. So does perfume. Any contour palettes or glow kits by Anastasia Beverly Hills will be tagged, so will any Naked palettes or the Sweet Peach eyeshadow palette from Too Faced. Basically the most popular items are the ones they tag.

My favorite items to lift from Ulta are foundation, rollerball perfumes (some of these are tagged though), eyebrow pencils, lipstick, mascara, and highlighter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure! At my training, we met our loss prevention manager at the store. He's very friendly once you get to know him but was of course trying to scare the shit out of us. To me, Nordstrom is more focused on internal theft than anything. We have a specific door that only employees can use, and everyone has a unique code to get in. If you try to hold the door open for someone, an alarm will go off. The cameras are state of the art PTZ cameras and they're all over the store. We have no shelves and everything is very open, so no blind spots. 

We learned some basic LP training when I was hired, but the main thing they told us was that we're not allowed to apprehend even if we see someone put something in their bag. Because it "offends the customer". But we have a special key on our computer to page LP to come to our area. There is always someone watching cameras and they have several plainclothes. When we need LP, we page "Clay Morgan" to come to whatever department needs help.

One of the managers who trained us said that "the best deterrent to theft is great customer service!" Pffffft. That's actually company policy. It was in our handbook.

We mostly get return fraud but like any other store people will conceal shit in their bags and go. LP has their own office where they detain lifters and cuff them. They take LP very seriously and will directly contact the police.

Cameras can see everything from the color of your eyes to the time on your fucking watch. They're the same cameras that are used in casinos.

I'm SO tempted to lift something from our store (because there's no way in hell I could afford anything there), but I would recommend not fucking with Nordstrom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem! I'm flattered that you asked me. Lol.

All of the employees wear all black. At most Ultas, only the employees at the cash wrap have headsets, along with the store manager. Small items (lipsticks, eyebrow pencils, blushes, etc.) are easy to grab and conceal and usually aren't tagged. Mainly be on the lookout for RFIDs (and sometimes they hide sensors in packaging...be careful) If employees try to approach you, ask where you can find an item that they don't have (like Hourglass products, Kat Von D products, or Beauty Blenders). This will usually deter them. There's a few good blind spots, especially in the aisles where the drugstore makeup is or where the drugstore skin care products are. Just be aware of employees, nosy customers, cameras, and mirrors. Best tactic is to crouch down and look at "items on the bottom shelf" and peel off sensors, and conceal your haul in your bag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally agree with everything you had to say here. I also find it serendipitous that the majority of folks I've met in this community are genuinely good people. Lifting doesn't make someone a bad person. People with no concern for others and with huge egos (i.e. the Walton siblings) are the real bad people in this world.

I appreciate your kind words, man. Be safe and keep doing what you're doing. You're a really good person and I wish you the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! I'm so excited! Lifting has played a significant role in me being able to finally afford a place. Once I started getting good, I'd lift more expensive things (especially makeup) and sell them to save up some cash or for lunch money. I also still lift groceries (especially at places with reusable bags) because no one can live off of McDonalds and soda, and healthy food is expensive as fuck.

I enjoy lifting and I'm proud of myself when I pull off tricky lifts, but someday I'd like to be secure enough to not have to steal. Well...maybe I will every once in a while. Lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I moved out of my parents' house earlier this year to get away from the abuse, I used to go get a sandwich with fresh meat and lots of veggies and a drink at the deli, or hot soup for dinner. It was nice to have a substantial, fresh, healthy meal for free instead of spending a dollar on a McChicken every day.

Honestly, I think publix kind of assumes the best in people. I sometimes feel a tiny bit bad lifting from them, because everyone there is so genuinely friendly and helpful.

But fuck yeah. Publix is a goldmine. </TEXT>

We have a button on the register that pages LP to our area instantly. There's quite a few plainclothes, tons of PTZ cameras, no shelves, and we have a code name for LP so over the intercom you'll hear "(Codename) to (insert department here)"

Be careful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this isn't perfect, but I recently made a post detailing my experiences at stores and my advice as far as risk level goes, and I saw a few commenters who wanted to make a master list of personal experiences with stores.

Here's my idea: comment with your experiences below and rate each store's risk level (in your opinion) on a scale of 1-5. (One being the lowest, 5 being the highest) 
Once I get an ample amount of responses, I'll compile a master list and average the risk rating for each store, and add on a short description of general comments. 

Let me know what you guys think of this idea/format and add on your experiences with different stores and a 1-5 risk level. 

Happy lifting! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I realize that store layouts vary. These were just my personal experiences (partly because I wanted to sit down and make a solid list of every place I've lifted from, LOL) and because I hoped maybe you guys could take something from it. I know lifting is different for everyone but I just figured I'd give you all my 2 cents. Definitely scope the place out, and pay attention to the atmosphere. If you get a bad vibe, LEAVE.

Also, that is a fair point about the mesh shopping bags, but I have a fairly large purse and that concealed the shopping bag easily. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Lifting Experiences/Advice </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-20 05:53:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is a list of all the stores I've lifted from and MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE in case it can be of use to anyone. I'm not claiming these circumstances are the same at every single store, so if you take my advice, proceed with caution.


Target - first store I started lifting at. Started stealing small things, then did several push-outs. They have reusable bags now which makes it easy. My best trick was to start heading toward the exit through the dollar spot and look at items there, then when employees and customers are gone, confidently head to the exit.

Walmart - SO MANY BLIND SPOTS. Customers are nosy though. Not many items are tagged and some of the "sensors" on their jewelry are decoys.

CVS - fairly easy to lift from. Employees don't care. Plenty of blind spots. But sometimes they hide the sensors on their products really well (especially cosmetics) and you have to be careful. Best bet is to head to the bathroom and remove packaging, then stash it in a ceiling tile. Use the hand dryer to mask any noises the packaging makes. Be careful because checkout lines are near the exit, so employees hang out there...not many blind spots.

Publix - back when I was practically homeless, I used to go to their deli and order sandwiches, make myself a drink, and walk out. Good, easy way to get a healthy and substantial meal. They don't ring you up at the deli so you can just walk out.

Ulta - several blind spots (i.e. drugstore makeup and hair care or skincare) come late in the day, when the manager is gone, and when there are few employees and they all want to go home. They won't address you. Be careful of sneaky RFID tags. Some of their products are tagged with these weird, light-sensing things that SUCK. easy to conceal small items. Best tactic for me is to go to an aisle with few cameras and no customers and to crouch down to "look at items on the bottom shelf" and then stuff items in my purse. Park away from the store because they WILL get your license plate number.

Sephora - BEWARE. This is the one store I've ever been busted in, and I've been lifting for over a year. Employees are very condescending and they will watch you like a hawk if you don't have a certain "look". They follow you around the store and every employee has a walkie/headset. Nothing is tagged, so if you're really good, go right ahead, especially if they're busy. I've gotten away once with a pretty decent haul. Sephora inside of JC Penney is a fucking cake walk. Items are tagged but the towers are at the exits to the entire store. There's normally only one or two employees. Stupidly enough, popular items (at the store in my area) are stocked around the perimeter which makes it sooo easy to just grab them under your arm and walk away. Head to a fitting room (which are totally unattended by the way) and peel off the RFID tags. I stick them to the back of the mirror so no one will see.

Barnes and Noble - fairly easy, but employees are somewhat hard to spot. My number one tactic is to grab some books I like, wander around the store "shopping" and then casually head over to the Starbucks. I chill at a table near the exit (yes, there is an exit in the caf and it makes things gloriously easy) and read, then leave.

Sally Beauty Supply - this one is moderately difficult. There's like one camera in the store and it's a small store with very hands-on employees, but you're golden if you come in when they're super busy or late at night when no one wants to help any customers. Nothing is tagged and the shelves are super tall!

Victoria's Secret - this one can be difficult if a lot of people are working because they will customer service the shit out of you. Try to go late at night. Make sure you can spot all of the employees. The VS I go to has a bathroom and multiple exits, which is a life saver. The little panty drawers make your job easier because you can crouch down to "look in the bottom drawer" while concealing goodies. (I actually visited there today)

Forever 21 - most jewelry is not tagged. Occasionally a random item will not be tagged. If they have those mesh shopping bags, look for one that doesn't have a sensor on it (this doesn't take long). Casually fill it up with items to "purchase" and then stroll the fuck out while the cashiers are busy with other customers.

Old Navy - at the store near me, I have seen an employee actually on the floor ONCE. Fitting rooms are usually NOT monitored (especially early in the morning) and a good bit of their items are not tagged. Just take a few items to the dressing room (some you want and some you don't want. They won't count them), stuff the ones you want in your bag, and leave the ones you don't. The stores are usually super busy with very little staff. Have fun!

Famous footwear - easy if you're experienced. Clearance shelves are super high up and easy to conceal in. Staff do not help you much unless you approach them first. Little to no cameras.

Ross - easy to pocket small items (journals, makeup, trinkets, etc.)  but most of their shit is tagged. They count items going into fitting rooms. Cash wrap "blocks" the exit.

JoAnn - SUPER EASY. I've done a few push-outs here. A friend of mine just stuck a $300 sewing machine in a cart and walked out, no questions asked. Very few employees, little to no cameras, and tall shelves. Just be cautious around the sewing department/fabrics.

DSW - fairly easy. Not many employees but lots of customers. NO CAMERAS in the clearance section. Only purses/glasses are tagged. Just act confident.

Torrid - I used to work here and it's so easy. They don't chase or apprehend (don't want to "offend" the customer). There are usually 1-3 employees working at a time. No cameras, no LP. They don't count items going into fitting rooms, but almost all items are tagged.

Best Buy - VERY RISKY. Stick to small items and act like you're just browsing. Act like you're not doing anything wrong, and head to the bathroom as long as no employees are nearby (they're allowed to follow you), then remove the packaging because their sensors are sneaky and stash it in a ceiling tile.

Staples - super easy. Outdated cameras, few employees. Shelves are extremely high and can conceal you easily.
Toys R Us - a fucking cake walk. It's easy to get away from employees because the store is so huge. Quite a few cameras, though. But if you go later at night there's very few employees at the cash wrap so you can just walk out.

Victoria's Secret Pink - employees are somewhat pushy, put it's pretty simple when they're busy. All clothing is tagged but perfumes, lotions etc. are a buffet.

Urban Outfitters - somewhat difficult because the store layout is fairly open, but employees generally don't give a shit and lounge around at the cash wrap talking. They aren't consistent with tagging items and most of the time won't approach you at all. 

MAC Cosmetics - be VERY careful. I wouldn't recommend going here just because you won't get much out of it. I stole a sample once but that was all I could get away with. Employees are similar to the ones at Sephora, very rude and judgmental and will single customers out. Their products are stored in drawers that they flip out if you touch AT ALL. Boo.

Disney Store - easy but I stole there once and felt like a terrible person. They aren't allowed to chase or apprehend and very little is tagged.

JC Penney - easy late at night. There are almost no employees in sight and very little is tagged. I grabbed two dresses and walked out without seeing anyone.

Books a Million - nothing is tagged. Few if any employees on the floor. 

Nordstrom ****I've never lifted here but I work here and wanted to give you guys a warning. VERY IMPORTANT. I wouldn't recommend lifting here...we are all trained in basic LP, we have the same cameras as casinos (PTZ and "can go so far as to read your phone screen" per my LPM) and our registers have buttons to page LP. There is a code name for LP (not sure if I should mention it) and we have plainclothes LP too. They don't fuck around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've done several push-outs at Target for over a year and have never been caught. I was apprehended once but I was let go immediately. Ulta is somewhat easy if you know what to take. They have these new weird sensors now with a light sensor, so that if you palm them or stick them in a bag they beep. It's pretty easy to find blind spots at Ulta and I've never even been approached by staff. I know what hours are the best to lift based on who's working. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Glad to see such an awesome community of people. I've hidden my lifting from my boyfriend and friends and family...although I did get a close friend to start. Lol.

I'm not exactly a rookie. I've been lifting for a little over a year now, but my techniques aren't great.

They work, so I guess that's alright, but I've been somewhat sloppy and I worry that I could get caught. I came to this community to meet my fellow lifters and learn some tricks of the trade!

My favorite places to lift from are Target, Walmart, Ulta, and Old Navy. Comment your favorite stores below! </TEXT>
