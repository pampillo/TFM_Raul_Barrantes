<TEXT> Well, paint is definitely safer method because you can throw it from a far, but I think that it can easily wiped off with wipers before it dries. 

As far as tips if you guys have any specific questions I'll be glad to answer them if I can. For the record it is not my intention to put anyone in to harms way. It goes without saying that everyone should be careful. No politician is worth your life. 

You should look in to ways to prevent armored vehicles reaching demonstrators in the first place. Our organizers would commander large vehicles (mainly city busses, heavy construction equipment and in some cases disabled police vehicles ) and put them as a road block. 

Additionally you can target tires and engine compartments ( if there is any openings ) ... Fire burning on top of the armored vehicle won't do much, however if tires or engine compartment is on fire it will eventually immobilize vehicle unless they come out to put out the fire. 

To put this all pin prospective we were protesting for about 7 years before following events took place.

Beginning of the end for Milosevic was when construction worker took his bulldozer and symbolically "attacked" building of national television ( dictators propaganda machine ) As soon as that happened people rushed the building as well as both buildings of national parliament and there was no stopping them. 

Here is unedited video of events form that day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCAdPBZLqTA </TEXT>

So if I'm braking any rules mods please take my post down.

For the record I'm from Yugoslavia and during 90s I was involved in demonstrations agains oppressive regime of Slobodan Milosevic. He too was sending tanks and armored vehicles on civilians so I know for fact this will work. For the record you should all be aware that it is extremely dangerous.


Use blanket to throw it over drivers window or camera they may have on the vehicle. Once their view is obstructed they will be forced to stop and or exit the vehicle in order to remove obstruction.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, not one bit. However I'm concerned for the sport it self and judging by what happened in other major sports chances of top level athletes not taking PEDs in this league are slim to none.

We are talking about the league that only follows basic minimum standards by occasionally slapping on the wrist mediocre players. Heck they didn't even test for PEDs until two or three seasons ago. 

For the record I'm not saying that LeBron is alone in this, many players do shit that human bodies are not designed to handle, I don't care how much work you put in to it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So by that reasoning Spanish, Chinese, French and Tagalog should all be official languages in United States, right? 

Also I know form personal experience that Albanians are not teaching children language of the home country ( I'm talking about kids in their early teens ) and I'm not talking about some random villages. I'm talking about kids living in cities that can't communicate with their neighbors. 

That in my opinion is outrageous and unacceptable and most importantly clearly shows intent of divide and separation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kosovo is independent for now. Uniting Kosovo with Albania is already underway. Unofficially they are already united on so many levels. 

As far as flag, in this context that is clearly provocation. Nothing more nothing less. Talat Xhaferi is first and foremost Macedonian who was born and raised there as well as his parents, grandparents, etc ... He did not immigrated to Macedonia. Further more he served in Yugoslav and well as Macedonian army as officer for close to 20 years. 

Flying foreign flag is acceptable during official visits. Flying it next to Macedonian flag on the desk in one of the most important offices in the country is disrespectful to all Macedonians to say the least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Realistically speaking it would be impossible for all bible characters to be exclusively straight. Also it is not just " some of us Christians " that demonize homosexuality it is wast ( virtually all ) clergy that demonizes homosexuality, and that is precisely what matters. It is extremely important what preachers say to clergy. Heck I have more than one Christian priest on tape talking about evils of gay marriage during wedding ceremonies! Just imagine what they say behind closed doors. 

The issue that I have in with Bible in general is that no one could read or translate original transcript. Bible is written in a dead language that had about 3500 words in vocabulary. Words and phrases literarily had dozens of different meanings depending on the context so how can someone take anything written in it seriously? 

Further there is over 20 popular translation of Bible. Not a single one is same and often same passages have completely different meanings. 

Just check out this particular passage and number of different translations and meaning. Same could be applied to virtually every other part of Bible.

<TEXT> New Jersey

Just like many others states, corruption in politics is out of hand. 

For example since early 80s every mayor of my town ether resigned or ended up in prison during their term. 

Funny thing is that because of some local law new mayor is chosen by a single person that is assigned to that position ( this person is appointed and can't be replaced unless mayor chooses to do so ) ... Oddly enough same person has been assigning all these crooked mayors since, you guessed it, early 80s :) 

We have mayoral election coming up and as of right now only relevant candidate is the guy that was assigned to that position. I just wonder how long before he ends up in prison too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how patriotic this was, but to me most uniting moment I have experienced was when almost entire Northeast and parts of Midwest along with parts of Canada lost electricity in 2003. I was driving from New Jersey to Manhattan when it happened and on radio they were already warning people ~~about looting and riots as soon as it gets dark~~ fear mongering. 

In reality everyone came together! People with cars were ( my self included ) were cramming complete strangers in cars to give them a ride. Random civilians were standing on the intersections regulating traffic. Even some restaurants were giving away food for free. 

Once it got dark people were just hanging out on the streets and connecting with neighbors ( totally unusual for Manhattan ) 

Gogol Bordello even made a song about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzBpkkM3qP8

It was truly magical moment in the sense that everyone came together without any prejudice even though media was telling us otherwise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is the thing, only small number of cities actually oblige. Majority just stay quiet and don't enforce policy even though they are not officially sanctuary cities. 

I'll give you an example form personal experience. Amarillo, TX is not officially sanctuary city, right? Well, I personally know refugee family that was relocated to Amarillo by US government and given job at one of Amarillo's massive slaughterhouses, and it wasn't just them it was hundreds of people that escaped Bosnian Civil War. Now here is where it gets interesting and relevant. These slaughterhouses employ thousands of people and majority of them are illegal immigrants. Everyone knows that, and in some cases they even provide mobile home type of housing for "temporary work force" yet local law enforcement and prosecutors never raided employers nor did they prosecute any of them form employing illegals. Why? Well, because they know that if they prosecute and deport people involved massive chuck of income for local government and residents alike will disappear in to a thin air. Further more it would create vacuum in supply and increased prices for you and me because employers would not be able to find US workforce willing to stand in blood up to their ankles 12 hours per day and get paid $4-6 per hour with no benefits or overtime. And that brings back me to my original point that I already talked about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is not local law enforcements job to handle matters of immigration, they are not paid, qualified or trained to do this.

Only fraction of people actually crosses border illegally by running trough a dessert or in hidden compartments of various vehicles. Vast majority of people actually come to US legally and than overstay their visa. 

If he really wanted to get serious about immigration he would go after employers like [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/20/us/tyson-foods-indicted-in-plan-to-smuggle-illegal-workers.html) or [this](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/04/16/many-illegal-immigrants-have-jobs-in-us-before-crossing-border.html)

And it is not just Tyson Foods and Asian Restaurants. Truth is US food and in some cases manufacturing and service industries can't afford to pay workers fair wage along with pension and medical coverage. 

Point is that people would stop coming if employers would stop hiring. Trump knows this because he is one of employers that hires these people trough various subcontractors. That is why we have this farce of immigration policy and publicity stunt like policies that only waste everyones time and money and don't address real problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some common sense laws regarding guns should be federal, for example making sure that person is mentally stable should be no brainer or having mandatory training so that people that own guns know how to use them. 

I don't really think that anyone relevant on the left is arguing in favor of blanket ban on anything. Rhetoric coming form NRA and interest groups like NRA is that you can't give an inch because if you do "they will come and take your guns away" and that is nothing more than brainwashing.

<TEXT> Well, I grew up in civil war and was protesting one of the most vicious dictators in modern European history. Milosevi did send out armed forces police and military on people/protestors. Heck he even send fucking tanks on people/protestors. Only reason why there was no bloodshed is because opposition organizers as well as protestors refused to engage. We were literarily fighting them with fists, sticks and rocks. No one ever fired a single bullet.

Also you have to understand that in situations like this people protecting dictator are corrupt and some already have blood on their hands, and by defending his regime they are defending them selfs too. They are well aware that once regime falls people will eat them alive. 

For the record Serbians love guns just as much as Americans. Grandfather give me first hunting rifle when I was 13 and I carried gun (illegally during civil war) when I was 15. 

Can you even begin to imagine aftermath where you have about 150000 protestors on one side and about 50000 of police on other killing each other on the streets.  </TEXT>

Ever since WWII our largest and most profitable manufacturing industry is exclusively making killing tools. We need consumers to unload all those goods and war is definitely most efficient way of getting rid of large quantities of product. 

With that said, I don't think that we should blame solders even though they willingly go in to fight. We should blame people that send them in to harms way because of their self interest. 

There is many mainly socio-economic reasons why would one join the Army, and once they are there they must follow orders.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is another perspective. 

More GROUND MAINTENANCE WORKERS die in the line of duty than cops. Exaggeration of danger that cops face on daily bases and narrative that you are pushing is what literarily allows them to get away with murder. 

If we prosecute and convict cops ( just like regular people ) when they use deadly force for no reason at all, general public would show much more support, respect and most importantly trust in to police force in general.

So with that said why not allow people who are willing to bring in stuff form out of state? That stuff would most likely end up in landfill anyway. What difference does it make if landfill is in California or some other state.  </TEXT>

In my case cheaper/smaller/lighter is better (up to $80 I guess). I basically just need head.

Tripod with main camera would go on top of it. 

This way I would have second camera on hand and ready to go at any time. </TEXT>

Additionally if you plan on using A6300 you might want to do something about external power supply. 

Here is really cheap solution that I'm currently using ...

Note - Batter pack used in the video is no longer available for sale I purchased few of these and they give me about 4 hours of continuous shooting.

<TEXT> As far as I know ( some of it from personal experience ) US does not "carpet bomb" in order to keep civilian casualties to minimum. 

During NATO bombing of Serbia they were surgically hitting targets such as particular floor in high-rise that housed TV station or some military department within building located in the center of Belgrade. 

We used to visit sites that were bombed the night before ( school was closed so we had nothing better to do and it was truly impressive how precise and destructive they are in small radius. 

With that said they also had a lot of collateral damage ( usually caused by human error ) where they unload fighter jets over little town full of civilians or targeting train filled with thousands of refugees. 

This particular bomb is "carpet bombing" type of weapon in my opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stop spinning your own words, your original statement was clearly false, and to be perfectly honest it is insulting to anyone that had family that died actually fighting Third Reich in WWII. 

After WWII entire world was in ruins morally and financially, many populations/groups were prosecuted, purged and suffered before during and after WWII, and that will continue until the end of time. 

Sorry to disappoint you but Jews do not have monopoly on suffering and prosecution. Just ask Gypsies, Palestinians, Tibetans, Armenians, Albanians ... I'm not going to even mention tens of millions of people all over Africa, Central and South America that still to this day are facing prosecution and genocide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> O I know, and that is why Russia has Jewish Autonomous Oblast that was established in 1930s ( golden age of communist regime in Russia ) and still exists today and beside Israel it is the only Jewish territory in the world! 

Also correct me if I'm wrong but for decades after WWII and during communist regime only people that were allowed to move out of Russia were in fact Jews. By doing so Russians essentially helped create Israel because largest Jewish population in history in fact lived on Russian territory.

Truth is there were only short periods of time when Jews faced procession in Russia and that was for the most part done by Tzar Alexander III and not Red Army. As the matter of fact Red Army prosecuted and executed people involved in purges once they took control of territories where Jews were being executed. 

Truth is that you are trying to play victims card and than when you get called out you start to backpedal and talk about stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with topic at hand. 

Finally you failed to explain why did you insult every single Polack on planet earth by saying that they were in fact Nazi supporters and that they helped transport and purge Jews in WWII when in real life they were the nation that sufferer just as much as Jews.  </TEXT>

What the fuck are you talking about? 

Russia is the single most deserving nation in fight against Third Reich Regime. If it wasn't for their determination and sacrifice outcome of the war could have been much different especially for Jews!  

Point is that Jews them selfs identify as Jews and not as Americans or Russians or Dutch or Germans. It really does not matter if country was friendly to them or not during the WWII. No other group/population in the world states their religion before their nationality.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You do understand that Jews were not only people that were sent to concentration camps in WWII. 

For example one of the largest concentration camps in Europe was Jasenovac in Croatia and was operated by Ustae ( Croatian Nationalistic Army that was fighting on the side on Nazis ) majority of people in concentration camps operated by Ustae were in fact Serbs, Gypsies, Bosnians, Albanians, etc ... 

There is no denying that for the most part Jews were main target of Nazis, but to say that they were only people that suffered in concentration camps is historically inaccurate and even offensive for those of us who had ancestors that shared the same fate as Jews.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, to be fair he does have a point that Hitler didn't use chemical weapons on his own people ... Who cares about use of chemical weapons on people of virtually all other nations in Europe.

That is considered FairPlay, right? 

Edit: I have made the mistake and you people are right, there was many Jews that in fact had German citizenship, so in turn they are Germans. Now with that said, I live in area that is heavily populated by Jews, and I have yet to hear a single one of them say ( publicly or privately ) that they are _______ of Jewish descent. It is always I'm Jewish, but my family is originally form Germany, Hungary, Austria, Yugoslavia, Russia, etc ... Not a single one identifies with nationality of origin only with religion!

Point that I'm trying to make is that you can't really claim nationality only when it is convenient for you. That is not a right way of doing things. 

Now you can continue with down votes ...

<TEXT> It is mainly self interest, but most of them can't just "switch sides" because they are already neck deep in to all kinds of criminal activities so they have to stay loyal no matter what. 

For example in late 90's ( when I lived in Serbia ) it was not uncommon for police lieutenant for example to take out an ad in news papers in order to publicly express his condolences to grieving family of well known criminal that was murdered by someone for whatever reason. 

For the record we are talking about Miloevi regime, now what you also need to understand is that current president and premier Aleksandar Vui and people closest to him were all part of that same regime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wrong! 

Police Union actually put out the statement 3 days ago fully supporting students/protestors. 

Here is google translation of article talking about it, along with the link to original article and official statement it self.


Police union supported the "Protest against the dictatorship," a press release in which it stated that it does not put anybody's side and calling on all political parties to let children and students to peacefully express their dissatisfaction. "Dear, do not think about your own interests, and your families, think of all citizens, their families, children and generations yet to come", said among other things in a statement published on the Facebook page Union of Police. This communication is addressed to "Let's listen to children."
They call on all parties to let young people express their discontent through peaceful means and also called on police officers to apply the legal authority.
Distinguished from the ruling party and the opposition sit together and resolve this issue in a separate room if need be, kill one another, but do not allow loss of life of children, the citizen or the police officer, because you did something wrong - conclusion statements.
Representative Police union of Serbia and Military Union of Serbia announced today that due to the bad situation and standards of employees on April 8 protest outside the Serbian government building in Belgrade.
In a statement signed by the President of the Police Union Veljko Mijailovic has stated that it is a difficult situation in the Serbian Interior Ministry and the Serbian Army made him the fourth time take to the streets and demand their rights.

<TEXT> You definitely need at least one flash and wide lens especially if you are plaining on doing formal group shots. 

As stated before ideally you should get 24-70mm because it is more or less do it all for this type of work. I personally don't like to swap lenses all night long especially if I'm working with mirrorless camera. 

As far as tips for beginner, biggest time saver during formal group shots is that everyone who should be in pictures is available at the same time. Meaning ask someone to wrangle all close family and friends place couple where you want them and than just add and subtract people as needed. 

During party/dancing portion try not to isolate people to much when framing shots, because people like to see stuff happening around them. Also try to take photojournalistic approach and don't make your self center of attention.

<TEXT> Following is not my comment it is a comment of Trump supporter. No one wants US to enter another war. "Serving justice" while not knowing who did what is what got us in to this state to begin with. 

 I'm a huge Trump supporter, but this is one of the key reasons I voted for Trump, not to get involved in foreign entanglements that do not benefit the American people.
 Atrocities are being committed around the world and we ignore all of them except for this one? Are we now doing Hillary and her overlords bidding?
 There was good evidence that the last gas attack was actually perpetrated by ISIS on their own civilians to drum up propaganda for their cause. We know that the supposed white hats in Syria are a fake news organization, having been caught staging stories to support sympathy for jihad. Why is this different? Indeed there are many similarities and people are already point out inconsistencies in the sarin gas narrative.
 What is the implication of this attack? Has Trump been compromised? Are their traitors on his staff? Is he starting to become mesmerized by the control-left media, or is their some deeper plan behind all this?
 I can only pray that the truth prevails and Trump stays true to his convictions. If he was lied to, then he should expose the liars. Time will tell.

They were stuffing the boxes like there is not tomorrow. There were 800 000 more voters than people legally allowed to vote in Serbia. 

Shame on you for your bias and spreading misinformation while you are moderating some of the largest subs on Reddit. 

Also I saw your other comments and they are nothing more than regurgitated washed out excuses that are coming form Vuiis government.

<TEXT> I used [Route 1 Car Rental](https://www.route1carrental.is) in January. 

Originally we had Hertz and price was average, but after getting there our group decided to split in two so we ended up renting another vehicle. What I found is that if you rent a car or reserve a room last min. (24h or less) you will save up to 50%!!! 

For the record I was there in off season so this may not be true during summer. 

Here is the post I made when I returned it may be useful to you:

I'm not denying that chetniks saved your father, but the picture that you are painting of Chetniks not even close. 

Belgrade nullified his treason conviction because people who are in power are far right nationalist. Basically same exact people that were involved in Yugoslavian civil war. Heck some of them were even is Hague war tribunal, but were released. 

Nothing has changed there as far as politics and nationalism they just shuffle political titles from time to time. That is all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 90s, you guys tried to exterminate all the Bosniaks (muslims), which is why Nato started bombing there.

Actually not, war in Bosnia ended in 1995. Nato bombing of Serbia started in 1999. 

According to interview for BBC documentary Madeleine Albright stated that they wanted to use infrastructure (air space, roads and land) to build NATO base in Balkans and Milosevic basically told them to fuck off unless they pay him. They didn't so they started to bomb the shit out of us for two month straight. 

Naturally base was built in Kosovo ( [Camp Bondsteel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bondsteel) ) and my understanding is that it is one of the largest in Europe.

<TEXT> Story time!

There is a church of something that comes to my door at least 5-6 times a year and it is always the same story. They knock I open and first thing they ask is my nationality ( I have unique name that is exclusive for that particular nationality ). 

Now just for the record we are talking about Christian Church and majority of people of my nationality is not Christian. 

I live in apartment complex and they only come to my door. They don't introduce them selfs nor do they want to answer how did they found me or what they want, unless I specifically state my nationality. It is totally creepy. 

Usually I just let them off easy and just tell them that I'm not religious and that they should take me off their list.

Last time they showed up, I told them the same thing and one of the guys actually started looking pass my shoulder and asking if there is anyone else in the household they can talk to. At that point I lost my shit. I started yelling at him and told them never to come back. 

I honestly don't know what to do if and when they show up next time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you think that immigrants did this, right? 

How many muslims did Russia take in? 

No one is denying that there is a huge fucking problem in Europe. Heck I my self was a refugee form Balkan wars and I'm first one to say that simply opening borders was a catastrophic fucking error that never happened before. 

I personally spent close to 8 months in refugee camp and they vetted my entire family that entire time. Out of some two million people that left their homes at the time only few thousand were actually given refugee status and were allowed to immigrate to other countries. 

With that said claiming that immigrants did this moments after this happened is nothing more than fear mongering and fake news spreading at it's finest. 

So unless you have some actual evidence that no one else on planet has you can respectively fuck off with that bullshit.  </TEXT>

Science does not have all answers and that is the beauty of science and just further proves that human race will never know everything and that we will constantly evolve and advance. 

You are supporting dogma that is based on incomplete book that supposedly describes events that happened long, long before book it self was even written in dead language that only had about 3500 words in its vocabulary and where words and phrases have dozens of completely different meanings. For the record everything you do/see/touch in your entire life is based completely on science alone. Your entire life you will not come in contract with a single thing or event that was unquestionably created by creator. 

Heck you can't even produce two of the same independent translations of the book it self let alone any evidence that anything book is describing actually happened.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is because Priest/Rabbi/Imam always present them selfs as best of the best that society has to offer. All of them demand unquestionable trust and respect from their followers and general public. 

That is why they should be held to higher standards, and it is extremely important to expose them for what they truly are and that is humans with fake morals that use their influence for their personal interest. 

Further more his entire religious community including the school that he stole money form is actually supporting him. 

Here is the article from local news papers in Lakewood just read the comment section and than tell me what do you think. In if fact you are unbiased

<TEXT> Well, that is where we disagree. What we probably can agree on is that many scholars are "openly" atheist and in the same position as Rabbi where they could rob the school out of funds, right?

 You don't need to ask someone if they believe in god or not. They are all public figures that often make public statements and people ask for their opinion a lot. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out if they are in fact atheist or not. 

I guarantee that no one asked this criminal if he was Jewish Rabbi it is just publicly available information. 

Beauty of atheism is that it is not centralized nor it is organization of any kind. Some atheist are just more publicly successful than others and they use that success to talk about atheism to wide audiences.  </TEXT>

With that said, topic of this particular thread is a Rabbi stealing money form disabled children and trying to cover up his tracks while entire religious community along with school it self is doing their best to protect him. 

And that in my opinion is not Kosher. 

Again all I did was asked OP for example of atheist doing something similar since OP already made that claim. That is it nothing more nothing less. 

Now, since you are obviously triggered by my question do you have something to show for or you are just going to keep on making comments that have nothing to do with discussion at hand.  </TEXT>

Most interesting thing is that you are "not denying what is going on" but, you are just unaware of anything negative, because it does not happened in your community. I'm just surprised that you managed to find this fairly obscure sub, yet you are somehow completely oblivious to news and information that everyone in civilized society is bombarded with every second of every day. 

As far as divorce, if Jewish women would go to a lawyer, social worker, or even a police station they would be able to get protection and divorce form their abusive/asshole husbands. Instead they chose to pay Rabbis tens of thousands of dollars to kidnap and beat their husbands. So with that said I have ZERO sympathy for anyone and everyone involved. All of them belong in prison. 

Your passive aggressive insinuations that this sub is somehow anti-semi are bullshit plain and simple.  </TEXT>

Whales on the other hand are wild animals and population of 2 million is nothing impressive especially when you consider that there is around 90 different species of whales. Further more humans consume only specific species of whales so extracting large amounts of animals without way to replace them is serious problem for that particular species.

So as you can see we are not talking about rouge bad apple or two, we are talking about **Organized Crime Syndicate** that is hiding behind the vail of religion. 

Now if you actually do care about reputation of Jewish community maybe you should look in to rooting out the problem and turning criminals over to face the music instead of whining on internet about stereotypes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nonsense we overproduce ( export ) coal by 5 to 12% each year. There is no single solution for powering our civilization. Coal/natural gas/oil/wind/solar/hydro/hydrogen and yes even nuclear energy will all play big role for forceable future.

<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear about people of Wyoming, but here is the hard cold truth. Denying reality and science just because of ones personal interest while times are changing is not the way to go about doing things. 

Just imagine where would our society be if our ancestors denied the science when gasoline engine was introduced or hydroelectric plants were being built. Both of these inventions took a massive bite out of coal industry and in process changed the world as a whole and socio-economic standard of all people for better. 

As far as imports form China that is a myth. Truth is that US exports anywhere form 5 to 12% of total coal production ( depending on the year ) and only imports fraction of total coal consumed in US because it is cheaper to bring it in form Columbia, Brazil and Canada to parts of the West Coast and some Golf States. 

Sources: 

1. https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/how-much-coal-does-us-export-and-import

So as you can see we actually produce way more coal than we actually need, and I think that we can both agree that waisting resources such as coal and oil is everything but good for our nation. 

Finally renewable energy is here to stay. It is getting cheaper and cheaper by the minute and it is constantly expanding and employing more and more people. As of 2015 13.44% of all energy consumed in US came form renewable sources and that number will only grow. 

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_States

Finally there is so much our government can do to take care of people who lost their jobs not just in Wyoming but in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. Problem is that solutions are masterfully wrapped in to partisan narrative of socialism vs capitalism and for that reason no one wants to touch miners with the 10 foot pole. 

You guys won't benefit form this legislation, there is only so much coal we can consume and opening new coal powered plants is not on anyones agenda. 

So until we elect politicians that are willing to invest in to us The People instead of special interest and dying industries people of Wyoming will be loosing jobs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is the thing, no one is beating you over the head to use Facebook or Google there are alternatives out there. Most importantly they don't charge for any of their software or services. 

ISP's on the other hand do charge! A lot! And you can't even get online unless you are using their service. So in real world now they have complete monopoly over communication networks. Last time I checked there are laws against it. On top of that they get 10s of billions of dollars of our tax money to upgrade their networks. Yet instead of spending that money on introducing fiber optics for example they show it in to politicians and executive pockets. 

Do you see difference now?  </TEXT>

My father and my uncle had same surgery about 10 years apart. Both of them operated Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. 

Uncle who did surgery first had like 12 hour long surgery where they opened up his chest and he was in hospital for little over 30 days after the surgery. All together it took him close to one year to fully recover. 

My father had surgery less than 6 months ago and surgery lasted about two hours. They inserted everything through his inner thigh and he was out of the hospital after about 48h ... 10 days after the surgery Doctor give him clearance and he was back to work :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great info, thanks! 

Judging by what you are saying that means that my internet could be significantly slower, so in order to work properly and without any interruption I should probably need to upgrade my service to fastest possible option.

Also I found some "VPN routers" at the price of $130 for hardware plus yearly subscription. Do you think that adding router and just sending all data ( including stuff like Amazon Fire TV and Kodi ) would be good idea?  </TEXT>

Anyway as you all probably know [House voted to repeal FCC privacy rules](http://www.multichannel.com/news/congress/house-votes-scrap-fcc-privacy-rules/411803) so I figured this would be a good time for average Redditors ( my self included ) to learn more about VPN service. 

It would be great if someone in this community would create the post that would provide more information as to how VPN works, how to use it, what to stay away form.

Over the years I known bunch of people that did this in Maryland and New York. It is not my intention to talk you out of it, or to say that you will have same experience. I just think that it is something that you should know before committing any money to it especially if you have to pay that money back. 

First I have yet to meet person that was actually able to "make money" by staying with the program. At best you will be able to break even if you stay on strict eggs for breakfast and McDonalds for lunch and dinner diet. 

Second, they were working in amusement park but they were also sent to local private residences and condos to work as lifeguards and nannies. One girl didn't even know how to swim, but management company didn't really care as long as there was somebody hanging around the pool. Most of them had to work overtime but for some reason they didn't get paid for it. 

Third, they were being charged for accommodations ( not much about $200-300 a person ) Problem was that they would squeeze up to 8 or 10 people in to 2 bedroom apartment that normally cost about $1200 per month. Also people in those apartments were changing all the time so they had to constantly worry about someone stealing their stuff.

Fourth, agency that was doing this was originally form Bulgaria. Owner of the agency was US citizen and he ended up with a long prison sentence for following. He was charging kids thousands of dollars to extend their work visas after 3 or 6 months long program. For the record he did not secure extended work visas. All he was doing was sending applications for tourist visas, and kids didn't know about it until it was to late. Also he send out couple of thousand bogus tax returns in the name of kids that were doing work. 

With that said I also know few people that signed contracts to do serious hard work like oil fields, Alaskan fishing industry and cruise ships. They did make money at the end of each contract. Depending on position up to $20000 clean.

Finally once you are on US soil **DO NOT GIVE ANYONE FOR ANY REASON YOUR PASSPORT!**  </TEXT>

<TITLE> PSA warning about Sony A7SII; A7SII; A6300; A6500; and RX10 Mark II </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-24 19:22:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I do all my homework before making any purchases and none of the "independent reviewers online" even mention this issue, so I figured I should post here and warn everyone about this issue. I found out about following hard way, after purchasing my camera, that now I can't use it for filming in 4k on sunny days. 

First little background, I'm wedding videographer and part of my job is to film bride and groom photo session along with good percentage of ceremonies that are happening outside in bright sunlight. Reason why I added new Sony camera to my bag is so that I can film internally in 4k and be more mobile. 

Now imagine my surprise when I took my brand new tool for a spin and found out that LCD and EVF alike dim significantly when you go in to 4k mode even if I manually adjust settings to brightest option possible. In fact it is so dark that you can't even frame the shot properly especially when you are on gimbal. 

Official response form Sony is that it prevents overheating issue, but that is not entirely true, because A6500 for example will crap out in 4k ether way if you keep it running on room temperature ( 72F in my case ) 

Additionally if you do own or are planing to purchase A6500 get screen protector immediately! I literally brushed up my camera against gimbal while mounting it, and it left the mark on the screen.

For the record I have been doing this for years now and over the years I have owned close to dozen different cameras including two additional Sony mirrorless cameras and I have never had problems with scratching or shattering LCDs. 

Edit - Title correction, this is also true for A7RII ...  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Visited Iceland from Jan 16 to 25 ... Here is few things that I wish I knew in advance </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-30 20:02:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *  Booking hotels last minute ( 24h or less ) is much cheaper than booking them months in advance. We were paying anywhere from $75 to $140 per night including free breakfast and WIFI at places that normally charge anywhere form $130 to $250 per night. 

* If your credit card charges exchange fees bring the cash and exchange it in the bank only. Banks in Iceland do not charge exchange rates. Always have credit card handy especially in remote areas if you need to stop by self service gas pump after hours. 

* Get a local SIM card form Siminn at the airport for $30 it will arguably be best purchase you made on entire trip. 

* You will not interact with locals much. Mainly you will talk to other tourists and immigrants who work in service industry. Locals are polite but really cold not friendly at all. 

* Do not book tours especially not Aurora Borealis. Instead rent a car and explore at your own pace. You will save a lot of money and you will enjoy and see more. In Iceland there is no access restrictions and you can go anywhere you please. Only time you truly need a local guide is if you are going on a glacier or in to lava/ice cave. 

* Go Aurora hunting every single night even if rain and snow is in the forecast. More often than not you will find the patch of open sky fairly early. 

Use following sites and apps on your phone with local data you purchased at the airport to find Aurora your self: 

Here you can search for open patches of clear sky: http://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/
Here you can find locations without light pollution (more or less entire island of Iceland minus (Reykjavik area) : http://darksitefinder.com/map/
Aurora cloud map: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.dziadosz.aurora hl=en 

* In Iceland there is very little variety. Those "hand made Icelandic wool sweaters" for example are on every single corner, they are all made in Lithuania or something and there is like 5 different options only. Same goes for hats, gloves, magnets, t-shirts etc ... 

* Go to Blue Lagoon as early as humanly possible. Later in the day it becomes absurdly crowded and you can find your self waiting in line for over an hour even if you have reservation. Also get preferred access ( whatever they call it ) it is defiantly worth extra money. 

Finally don't be afraid to explore. We found some amazing sites just by taking the turn on random unmarked road. Once you find and experience them don't go online and broadcast the fucking thing to everyone and their mother. 

P.S. Fuck every single person that tagged the wreckage of DC-3 airplane.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any tips on how to film Aurora Borealis? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-18 20:46:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There is many tutorials for photographing Aurora Borealis however I can't seem to find any technical tips as to how to actually film them. Stuff like camera setting, fps, should we use SLOG 2 or not, etc ... My goal is to capture Northern Lights as realistic as possible. 

We don't have much time only (9 days in second part of January) so I would like to learn as much as possible ahead of time so that we can hit the ground running once we land in Iceland. 

Here is the list of gear that is available to us, I would like to narrow down selection so that we don't have to take everything with us. I know that lenses could be better, but as of right now that is all we could gather/afford. 

Cameras: 

Sony A7S ( Original )
Sony A6300 x 2 

Lenses: 

Canon: 15 f2.8 fisheye
Canon: 16-35 f2.8 II
Canon: 24-70 f2.8 I

Sony: 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 
Sony: 18-105mm f4
Sony: 30mm f/3.5 macro lens
Sony: 55mm f/1.8
Sony/Zeiss: 24-70 f4

Rokinon: 12mm f/2.0

Any advice or source would be much appreciated!!! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-12-10 01:08:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We will be in Iceland form Jan 17 to Jan 26 and as of right now I only found one dog sledding company ( www.dogsledding.is ) Unfortunately they only have one spot available on 22nd of January. Problem is that there is 4 of us in total and we would all like to go. 

So with that said are there any other companies that offer dog sledding? 

Finally most important question, is it worth spending $200 per person for only up to one hour of dog sledding?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Entire DNC leadership should resign. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-12 01:32:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Only way for current DNC leadership to save the honor and respect (or at least whatever is left of it) with us The People is to step down, and allow for new direction, entirely new leadership and fresh ideas. All this talk of being stunned, fighting back, not knowing, turning a new leaf, finding what the problem is, etc ... is pointless. They are the problem! All of them! No exceptions! 

America as a whole was screaming for help during entire elections including primaries, and they purposely chose to ignore it. We had candidate. A great candidate! Candidate with good ideas and most importantly support of the electorate! 

But no, they though it is business as usual ... Tell people what they want to hear, ignore the critics, throw few billion on media, marketing and pundits, bring few celebrities on rallies, and most importantly scare the living shit out of the electorate and they will eventually come around. Than they can just get back to business as usual braking campaign promises and looking out for special interest. 

Well, that did not happened this time around. On November 8 we The People did what we had to do in order to show them that business as usual in no longer acceptable way of doing things. 

Reforming DNC is not just changing narrative or sacrificing couple of DNC chairpersons (while making sure they get appointed to different positions within the system) but proactively changing the root of the problem. 

In my opinion platform and message overall are not the problem, besides changing any part of it is the easiest part. Problem lies with the messengers and the system they have created for them selfs and their Dynasties!

<TITLE> PSA about Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001 - If you have this Hard Drive Make Sure You Read This! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-05 14:36:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the record I'm not member of this sub, so I don't know if this type of post is allowed. Reason why I'm posting here is because I believe that some of you might benefit form this information. 

Point of this post is not to shit on Seagate (even though they deserve it) but to inform everyone here and hopefully prevent it form happening to someone else.

**Important** If you use Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001 and you don't have your stuff backed up on completely different HD do it as soon as humanly possible. I found out the hard way that these specific HDs have catastrophic failure rate! [Backblaze had to replace 4345 of these drives out of 4829 they deployed just three years earlier](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/3tb-hard-drive-failure/). 

[Additionally there is a Class Action Law Suit against Seagate that is concentrating specifically on Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/3tb-hard-drive-failure/)

**Story:** I'll try to keep in as short as possible.

I had three of these bad boys fail on me all at the same time and they were all purchased in December of 2014! All of my working files ( 5 wedding videos edits, all 5 almost completed! ) plus bunch of other personal stuff is gone! Two of them were in Raid 1 and third one was just a spare that I used to dump less important files. Luckily my cousin has few of these him self so we swapped few PBC boards and got them to spin but we were not able to retrieve the files because bios on each drive is unique to that particular drive so even if you have same exact board with the same PN and FW numbers you still need Bios from original board. Now this give me some hope to dig in to finding solution on my own. 

**Solution** First let me just say that I'm still in process of retrieving data so everything that you read may or may work actually work. If anyone is interested I can post an update once entire ordeal is over.

There is basically two possible ways of going about fixing the problem. 

**First option** is to test diodes and if you are lucky enough that you just had short and only one diode died you should be able to remove dead diode and get HD to work so that you can back up your files to different HD. Video below shows how to do it. 

Video for the first solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfvwER9JwJc list=FLRdjTQrB1Re3FBk2OpfwvVg index=2

**Second option** is to find exactly the same donor PBC board with matching PN and FW numbers (major pain in the ass, but I did manage to find two of them) and than remove Bios from your dead board and solder it to donor board. 

Video for second solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn2eL4o-6Eo list=FLRdjTQrB1Re3FBk2OpfwvVg index=1

**TL;DR** These specific Hard Drives are shit and if you are unfortunate enough to have one or more get rid of the cancer as soon as humanly possible. Additionally if you already had one die, you might be able to get some money out of Seagate trough Class Action Law Suit. 

**Edit** For the record all original files are safely backed up on two other locations. Only thing that was not backed up were my Adobe working files ( Premiere, After Effects, Audition, etc ... ) basically weeks and weeks of work! </TEXT>

Video for the first solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfvwER9JwJc list=FLRdjTQrB1Re3FBk2OpfwvVg index=2

**Second option** is to find exactly the same donor PBC board with matching PN and FW numbers (major pain in the ass, but I did manage to find two of them) and than remove Bios from your dead board and solder it to donor board.

**TL;DR** These specific Hard Drives are shit and if you are unfortunate enough to have one or more get rid of the cancer as soon as humanly possible. Additionally if you already had one die, you might be able to get some money out of Seagate trough Class Action Law Suit. 

**Edit** For the record all original files are safely backed up on two other locations. Only thing that was not backed up were my Adobe working files ( Premiere, After Effects, Audition, etc ... ) basically weeks and weeks of work! </TEXT>

<TITLE> PSA about Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001 - If you have this Hard Drive Make Sure You Read This! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-05 05:29:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Point of this post is not to shit on Seagate (even though they deserve it) but to inform everyone here and hopefully prevent it form happening to someone else.

**Important** If you use Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001 and you don't have your stuff backed up on completely different HD do it as soon as humanly possible. I found out the hard way that these specific HDs have catastrophic failure rate! [Backblaze had to replace 4345 of these drives out of 4829 they deployed just three years earlier](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/3tb-hard-drive-failure/). 

[Additionally there is a Class Action Law Suit against Seagate that is concentrating specifically on Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/3tb-hard-drive-failure/)

**Story:** I'll try to keep in as short as possible.

I had three of these bad boys fail on me all at the same time and they were all purchased in December of 2014! All of my working files ( 5 wedding videos edits, all 5 almost completed! ) plus bunch of other personal stuff is gone! Two of them were in Raid 1 and third one was just a spare that I used to dump less important files. Luckily my cousin has few of these him self so we swapped few PBC boards and got them to spin but we were not able to retrieve the files because bios on each drive is unique to that particular drive and even if you have same exact board with the same PN and FW numbers you still need Bios from original board. Now this give me some hope to dig in to finding solution on my own. 

**Solution** First let me just say that I'm still in process of retrieving data so everything that you read may or may work actually work. If anyone is interested I can post an update once entire ordeal is over.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I decided to sell few of my Canon bodes. I know that shutter count is low on all of them, and I would like to post exact number in description. I know that there is few applications, but I don't feel like testing few of them in order to find if they are accurate or not. 

So with that said what is your favorite way to check shutter count on Canon?

Edit: Cameras that I would like to find shutter count for are: Canon 5D, 5D Mark II, and 70D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Note:  I also posted the same question over at /r/videography.

I use A7S and edit with Premiere Pro CS 6. When I edit and color grade my footage everything looks just fine, but once I burn it to Blu-ray and play it on TV is looks really bad. It ether looks washed without any contrast out or blacks are crushed and bright colors are over saturated.
I realize that there is a difference between colorspace for TV and monitors. However I can't find any useful information on how to go about fixing the problem.
Is there a way to color for monitor for example and than export in REC/709?
Any information that would point me to the right direction will be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking in to upgrading my slider and I came across this little thing. It looks amazing on paper but I would like to hear what everyday users have to say about it. Online reviews that I found are mainly form bloggers that I assume get paid for their reviews. Is it really as smooth as online reviews say it is. Also how durable is track? Is there really a problem with the locking mechanism? 

I mainly shoot weddings so replacing my heavy 3 foot long Konova would greatly speed things up and allow me to shoot in much smaller spaces. 

For people that are not familiar with this slider, here is the one of the online reviews: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWhHPw14VYw </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today he will attend $5000.00 per plate [fund raiser](http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle/donald-trump-to-attend-fundraiser-in-nissequogue-thursday-1.12129876) on Long Island even though he said numerous times that he is the only candidate that does not owe anyone anything because he is funding his own campaign.  

EDIT: I think that we can all agree that HRC is a corporate puppet of the highest order and that voting for her is essentially voting for personal interest. However it is well worth mentioning that out of [98 million dollars that Trump campaign raise so far](https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00023864) (July 21, 2016) only about half (49 million dollars) was Trumps own money. Oldie101 already mentioned in this thread he will need at least half a billion dollars (I personally think much, much more) in order to stay competitive. It is obvious that individuals and organizations alike will be asked to donate millions of dollars at the time. Obviously majority of those large donors will want something in return. How can he raise all that money without giving in to special interest?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lets talk about Credit Card processing companies! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-01 23:30:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We think about adding credit card option for our clients. 

Idea is to start accepting online payments by having actual check out page where clients can come to and make credit/debit card payment. We are starting to get more and more business form out of town clients and everything is done over email and telephone. 

So far we looked in to PayPal, Stripe and Chase ( we have business account with Chase )

PayPal - We used them for few smaller transactions and to be perfectly honest, I don't like it all that much. Also they have a limit where we can only withdraw $1000.00 every 30 days so that is not really an option.

Stripe - Our host SquareSpace is recommending their platform, but form what I understand they are a nightmare to deal with, keep you money on hold for no good reason and have no live customer service.

Chase looks good on paper, but they have a lot of requirements and virtually no platform that can easily be incorporated in to existing website. 

Is there decent affordable platform for photographers that will allow us to set up website checkout and maybe even mobile charging without making us jump trough hoops in order to collect our money.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking in to purchasing [Breakthrough Photography x4 6 stop or 3 stop ND filter](http://breakthrough.photography/product/x4-neutral-density/) to pair it with my A7S and 24-70mm Zeiss and 18-105mm Sony. Overall bloggers online are raving about it, but they are mainly talking about stills and there is almost no reviews form real non paid users. 

So with that said if anyone here is using them please share your thoughts! Added bonus is you are Wedding Videographer, because I mainly shoot weddings. 

Edit: In order to avoid confusion, their X3 series ND filters were renamed in to X4 so basically we are still talking about exact same thing!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We are located in Northern New Jersey. We have 7 two story buildings housing about 45 units and majority of owners live in the units. 

So with that said here is what I would like to know:

Where can I find list of grants, incentives, tax brakes, etc ... available in my region? 

Since majority of units are empty during the day, do electricity companies such as PSE G ( local NJ provider ) pay for surplus electricity that we put back in to the grid or do they offer any other incentives? 

What information should I gather before I start talking to solar companies? 

Is there a way to pass savings/earnings directly to tenants or will association receive all benefits? 

What are some reputable companies in my region that I should contact? 

What are things we should look out for? 

Any other advice that you think would be relevant for our situation. 

If you guys need any additional info please let me know! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-05-26 02:52:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In about 10 days we are going to Southern Utah for the first time. Plan is to take RV and get lost in wilderness for about 2 weeks. I will be taking my camera gear ( that consist of one full frame body, 3 lenses, and some accessories ) with me and due to short flight connections I won't be checking any luggage. 

So with that in mind what advice could you give me as far as the clothing and shoes? What are essentials? Do I need long sleeves and pants or can I get away with few pairs of cargo shorts and t-shirts? Also do I need heavy duty shoes and socks or Marrell Bare Access and pair of sandals will do? 

Finally any other advice would be greatly appreciated!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just got of the phone with Cruise America and they give me a quote of $150.00 per day for 25ft RV and $120.00 per day for 30ft RV. Additionally there is a $0.35 charge per mile and insurance is included. We plan on driving about 1500miles in total. To me all this sounded to good to be true, and got me wondering why would they offer vehicle that would accommodate 7 for less than vehicle that would accommodate only 4. Additionally what are some must have accessories that we have to purchase/rent in order to make this work. Also, other than more gas money and harder to park, what are other less obvious drawbacks of larger RV? 

Based on information that I provided could anyone give me realistic estimate of how much would 10 day rental cost me. For what it is worth we are looking to pick up and drop of RV in Las Vegas and visit as many national parks in Utah as possible.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Wedding videographers, do you have a late fee provision in your contract? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-28 20:13:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking for some advice on formulating late fee terms for the contract. As of right now we require full payment 6 month after wedding day or on day of delivery. Whichever comes first.

Problem is that some clients simply " disappear " form the face of the earth and year or two goes by before they " reappear " to pay the balance and pick up the video, albums, etc ... 

**Edit:** I see that my question caused some confusion, so here is the detailed breakdown of how we charge. 

Deposit ( Usually $500 )

Remaining balance is due at the day of the wedding ( only if they are not ordering wedding albums )

If their package does include wedding albums than we charge 70% of remaining balance at the day of the wedding and remaining 30% after 6 month or when they pickup the albums and video ( whichever comes first ) 

Now, problem is that recently few clients with albums in their packages who are avoiding/stalling final payment and delivery. 

I figured that if we introduce late fee in the future it might help reduce number of people that are stalling with the final payments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happened last week. I'm form NJ and other driver is from Massachusetts. There is a minor paint damage on his bumper. At the time of accident we didn't call police, but instead decided just to exchange information. We started with the business cards, but than when it came to registration, insurance and ID he just said that he can't find his registration. Based on that I refused to give him any of my personal information other than what he already had on my business card. Just for the record he did take a picture of my license plate. 

Now he is calling me talking about filing a claim with his insurance or me compensating him for damages.

What are my options? Should I call my insurance company and tell them about it, or should I just let him deal with his insurance company?

Edit: For what is worth I was legally parked on the side of the road and I reversed my vehicle in to his illegally double parked vehicle.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Local news outlets are not reporting/downplaying last nights rally numbers. It is our duty to get the word out and inform average voter!!! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-14 15:21:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My local TV station News12 New Jersey just reported that " Sanders had few thousand supporters at the rally in one of Manhattan parks " and than promptly reported that " Hillary's rally in Bronx community center attracted whopping 1300 supporters!!! " Than they concluded how Hillary is winning popular and super delegate vote by a large margin and that it is obvious that Sanders is just stalling the inevitable!  

Unfortunately they forgot to mention that Sanders had 27000 turn out for Washington Square Park rally and that he broke Barak Obamas record number of 24000 supporters. 

In my opinion that " minor hiccup " of not reporting numbers/facts on both gatherings make a Yuuuge difference! Even though we are not talking about national TV network, we are still talking about millions of people/voters these local TV stations are reaching daily. Average person who is not interested in politics, but still votes will register this information and never think about it twice. 

Point that I'm trying to make is that people who actually need to hear these numbers are not being informed. Random voter does not pay attention to difference between few thousand and 1300, but if they hear 27000 vs 1300 they will most definitely know who gets the popular vote and who gets super delegates!  </TEXT>

Majority of governing that affects our everyday lives is done trough local governments. It is important to know who these people are and what they stand for.  

Edit: Even if you don't know any, or maybe just one or two, please post your answer. It would be just as interesting to see how many people can't name any. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> June 7, 2016 - New Jersey Primary Election

May 17, 2016 - Voter Registration Deadline, last opportunity to register to vote in the Primary Election.

Even though you are registered voter in NJ you must register for Primary Elections. 

For anyone in NJ that is not registered for Primary, you can find [instructions](http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/voting-information-party-declaration-forms.html) and [registration form](http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/form_pdf/party-affiliation-form-070314.pdf) here. 

 **Important**  

1. You do not have to register as a Democrat or Republican in order to be eligible to voat in primary! 

2. You can register as Unaffiliated and still be eligible to vote in Primary. 

**Edit**

As /u/captainMoustache pointed out you must declare your party affiliation in order to vote in NJ Primaries. However if this is your first Primary you can declare your party affiliation at the voting location. 

Here is the quote: 

"Can I declare my party affiliation at the polls?
You can declare your party affiliation at the polls when you go to vote in your first Primary Election. After that, you may change your party affiliation 55 days before a primary election."


More information can be found on this [page](http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/voting-information-voting-faq.html). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Regarding Bernies universal healthcare - Why is no one including his campagne talking about one of the most important money saving feature? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-02 18:25:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If we get universal healthcare that Sanders is fighting for we would should be paying significantly less for all other types of insurance. That is something that every single person and business in US can relate to! Look at your auto insurance policy for example I guarantee that largest expense on your policy is [PIP](https://coverhound.com/insurance-learning-center/what-is-pip-insurance) ( Personal injury protection ). Now I do know that in some states it is not mandatory, however I'm sure that most people still get it anyway simply because few broken bones or serious operation could easily bankrupt more or less any given person or small business. 

Take a look at what I pay every 6 month for insurance: 

Total insurance coverage Cost for six months: $715.00 

Bodily Injury Liability: $156.00

Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury: $33.00

Personal Injury Protection - Medical Expense: $230.00

Extended Medical Payments: $1.00

Total for medical expenses is: $420.00 for 6 month period or 59% of my total policy cost goes toward medical insurance!!! 

Now multiply these numbers with the number of public and private vehicles insured and that number would skyrocket in to billions of extra dollars that we as a society could use to improve education, employment, work environment, infrastructure, standard of living ... 

That is just one of the reasons I laugh when I hear the argument " Yes, universal health coverage is a great idea, but overall it will cost taxpayers more money "

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Until recently I was mainly drinking draft beers, so I never really though about it before because my tab could not exceed more than like $40-50 for few beers. Some of my friends work in really high end cocktail/hotel bars so they got me in to some expensive top shelf scotch among other crazy cocktails they mix all the time. They always give out free rounds of drink. Sometimes is one sometimes is three and couple of times we were not charged anything. I guess what I'm trying to say is that they could comp me anywhere form $25 to well over $100-150 on any given night. I never question them while they are behind the bar and always tip really good. However few times when I asked about it when we see each other outside of their " office " all of them would just say don't worry about it ... 

Reason why I'm asking this is because I know how hard they work and I don't want them to get in to the situation where they have to cover the loss that my party consumed.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is a right sub to ask this question, or if I'm braking any rules so mods please delete my post if there is any problems ... 

Anyway, I'm doing a video edit for jewish wedding, during the ring exchange ceremony there is a part where Rabbi is saying something to the groom in Hebrew and than groom is reciting something before he takes the ring. Right before that part Rabbi pushed away the mike and they were whispering during entire exchange. I had a lav on the groom so I'm able to get fairly decent audio, but I'm wondering if should I include it at all since they are obviously whispering and no one in the room of 300 plus people present at the time can't hear the word they are saying. Also in between Hebrew conversation they are speaking in English about some totally random stuff that most definitely should not be included.

Someone please help! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When you are on snow keep your speed steady and use the brake only when you really must by slightly tapping on the brake pedal several times instead of slamming that sucker like there is no tomorrow. Try to alter your speed only with gas pedal by looking at the road ahead of you and slowly adjust your speed accordingly. Also I like to use GPS even on the roads I'm familiar with because you will be aware of upcoming turns, lane changes and possible slowdowns. 

Also, clean the snow from the roof and windows you lazy bums! 

And for the love of god, get your self a decent set of tires! Few hundred bucks that you save because " you are a good driver and it won't happened to you " is not worthy someone else's life! 

**Edit:** Most modern cars are equipped with ABS ( Anti-lock braking system ) so there is no need to tap your brake pedal several times. All you need to do is slowly apply pressure and car computer will take care of it for you much faster than you ever would. Once you hear the grinning noise DO NOT release the brake, keep the same pressure, noise is just the sign that ABS is working!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I decided to play lottery after hearing about monster jackpot. After doing some research I found out that winner in NJ can't stay anonymous. I also found out that some states allow LLC or Trust Fund to claim the prize allowing winner to stay antonyms. Unfortunately I was not able to find specific instructions as to if and how would that work in NJ. Is anyone familiar with this matter? 

I know that chances of winning are 292 million to 1, but on an off chance that someone does win it would be a good idea if we would educate each other on how it would work in our state.

I have a lot of friends who are photographers/videographers and for the most part I have been selling to them and their colleagues, friends, etc ... In the last few month I have accumulated little more gear so I would like to find the way to expand market. Is this merchandise easy to move online? If so what should I go for, high margin or quick turnaround? How important it is to have box and instructions when selling online? As far as scammers is it safer to sell only to people in North America? Also any other advice that you think is relevant would be really appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for somewhat unusual website template? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-28 21:46:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking for template that would allow visitors to add/edit content. I have a large family scattered all over the world and after getting my hands on few boxes worth of old family photos I realized that more or less I have no idea who are the people in these photos. Some of them are dating back to early 20th century so people who actually know names, events, locations, etc ... are becoming harder and harder to find. Idea is to preserve family history and don't forget who we were and where are we coming from. Basically I would like to create a personal website where my family and friends can add old family photos in to specific classified galleries together with short description of events, location, names of people in images. 

I have very little experience with website development other than using a squarespace theme for my small business, so anything that would require me writing my own code is pretty much out of the question. 

If you know of any templates or have an idea how narrow down a search for something that could work for this purpose please leave a link/advice in comments. 

**EDIT** - I found what I'm looking for www.piwigo.org simple to use, looks great and there is about 140 different designs!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here is the thing. I witnessed the massive apartment building fire in my neighborhood tonight. I had my camera with me so I started filming and taking pictures. Somehow cops thought that I was with one of the fire departments ( there was 7 or 8 different fire departments responding ) and no one bothered me so I managed to get extremely close to the whole thing. There was no TV crews or reporters of any kind on the scene but I just saw local TV station talking about the fire but no footage. 

That got me wondering if I could maybe sell them some of mine footage. Since I have absolutely no experience with dealing with them I was wondering if someone could give me an advice or two. For what is worth my location is Northern New Jersey.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Where can I find casters that I need? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-30 06:39:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking to replace the casters on my [Tripod Dolly](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006TZ8R3W/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8 colid=3T0I55OQE8OSF coliid=I3C2PDPEV2SC8E) Basically I need 3" ball bearing caster with threaded stem. I have been looking for them for few month now and no luck. 

I would really appreciate if someone could point me to the right direction or recommend alternative. 

Casters should be as smooth as possible and easily transition from surface to surface without getting stuck. I'm will be using this for videography and I'm trying to avoid "bumps" during filming.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-06-27 03:31:13 </DATE>

<TEXT> I just picked up A7S and [Commlite adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F3ZFQK6?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) for Canon EF lenses. For some reason I can only use one focus mode and that is Single-shot AF. I would like to change it to DMF or MF mode so I can use constant focus peeking. When I attempt to change the setting I get following error message "Invalid With This Lens" 

For the record I tried multiple lenses. 35 2.0f IS, 16-35 II, 24-70 "old version, 70-200 2.8f IS II

I also tried to reconnect adapter to camera/lens, change battery, etc ... 

I really hope I can find the workaround because I really like the camera and I love my current glass!  </TEXT>

I know that officially no one does but, I know from personal experience that Canon will honor manufacturers warranty especially if you are CPS member.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm sure that some of you have thought about this too. Nevertheless I wanted to point this out in simplest possible way.

 In order to offset Koch brothers political contribution for 2016 presidential elections alone, each registered voter in US would need to donate about $7 to the same candidate. 

Koch brothers "freedom of speech" is about 150,000,000.00 greater than your or mine!

That is why we need Bernie, and that is why you need to talk to anyone that would listen until their ears bleed. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is the easiest way of communication with deaf couple? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-01 18:39:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We were contacted by deaf couple that is interested in hiring us to photograph their wedding. So far we exchanged few emails and I talked to brides mother once. I would love to be able to talk to couple personally and get their perspective directly form them. Meeting them in person is not an option because they are located in another state and wedding would take place in brides hometown (my state)

What would be best way for us to communicate other than email? Also any advice how to communicate on the day of the wedding? Unfortunately no one in our office knows sign language. Would it be out of the question to ask one of the family members to accompany us during bridal shoot? 

I apologize if this sound like a stupid question. I have very little experience in this matter so I would like to educate my self as much as possible in order to make this process as smooth as possible. 

EDIT: Thanks everyone! This helps a lot! Just keep them coming. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about USPS insurance. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-26 22:24:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First let me say I'm not a flipper, however I purchase things on Ebay/Amazon all the time and this is the first time I have problem. Seller did his part, but it looks like that post office messed things up with delivery.

I didn't receive the package even though seller send it to me, and on USPS site it does show that package was delivered. I talked to my mailman and he does not remember delivering package to me on that day. Also I talked to supervisor at the post office. She showed me some paper where my apartment number was not specified on the address. That is strange because my address is verified by Ebay and PayPal and it clearly shows my APT number...

 Basically her answer to me was that if mailman does not remember what he did with the package my shit is out of luck ...

Given that you guys are dealing with situations like this more often than most people any information/suggestion would be appreciated. 

P.S. It looks like package was insured for $100

Edit: Thanks for your help guys! I just send a message to seller asking to confirm what address did they send this item to ...  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Questions about purchasing Underwood # 5 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-05 05:03:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know nothing about typewrites, basically I'm purchasing present and I found this [Underwood#5](http://newjersey.craigslist.org/atq/4837938421.html). To me it looks really rough but they do say it works. I would like to go and see it, so basically I would like to know what should I look out for. Also how much is this machine worth? I saw them selling anywhere from $50 to $250 so I don't want to over pay. For what is worth I looked up the serial number and it looks like this machine is form 1907. 

Finally should I attempt to clean it up? I don't want to do full restoration, just to clean up the rust and dirt. Will that affect the value of this typewriter? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice needed for upcoming Wedding Show/Cancer Benefit Giveaway </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-20 23:16:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We are looking in to sponsoring local breast cancer benefit. One of the requirements as sponsor is to provide a gift of minimum $100.00 that will be awarded to one of the brides at the end of the show. Problem is that we can't donate our services or discounts so, since we are wedding photography and videography studio free engagement session or wedding album are out of the question. Also organizers don't like gift cards. Preferably I would like to get something that lucky bride would actually like! 

So here is the question. What do we get for unknown lucky bride starting at about $100.00?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I apologize if this post is breaking any rules! 

I would like to purchase few books for my niece. I tried Amazon but, all she got was an email telling her that books are not available for that region. They did give her a credit to download something else that she likes.

I don't have much experience with purchasing online books so I was wondering if I could get a suggestion where could I purchase and download " Night School Fracture and Resistance "

<TEXT> First I would like to apologize if I'm braking any rules by posting something business related. We are small wedding photography studio and I'm working on the text for promotional brochure that we will be using at upcoming show. I have no experience in writing advertising material and English is my second language. I would love to know if what I wrote is acceptable and of course any suggestions and revisions are appreciated. There is 5 separate parts and it's about 1300 words in total.

<TEXT> I'm new to video editing and this sub so if I'm braking any rules sorry. 

Now here is what I have a problem with. I use FCP X and I'm trying to convert AVI ( recorded in 2010 ) to MOV. For this I used quick time that comes with mac. I have two large files about 42gb each and when I do conversion I only get sound on first 9min and 28sec on each file. 

 I was wondering if anyone can recommend good all-around software that I can use for this or any other conversion that I may need in future. I don't mind paying for it since I will be using it often. </TEXT>

I do have internet connection and I did try few different machines. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  My sister and nice are spending vacation with me in USA and this morning I was talking to my sister about education, science, etc ... out of nowhere my 13 year old nice announces that she knows who made people! 

 For a moment I was mortified that I will have to try to explain evolution in few short minutes and make it interesting and convincing enough for 13 year old girl to understand. So while I was bracing for Adam and Eve story she started talking about earth cooling and water and amebas. For a moment I was proudest uncle in the world :)

 Some people may say " so what she learned that in school " and that maybe true, however she is coming form what we consider a 3rd world country that is heavily influenced by corrupt politicians and church with false morals. Fact that kids there are actually learning and accepting science instead of creationism and other nonsense is fantastic.

<TITLE> Advice needed on wedding photography advertising by giving away e-session </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-09 03:22:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here is the question. My partner and I started wedding photography studio in NY/NJ area few month ago. We are both experienced wedding photographers but our studio is new and we wanted to speed up the process by offering free engagement session on weddingwire.com in order to generate some interest and some business. The way we wanted to do it is to have people sign up for a month and than pick one couple. 
Is this good marketing idea? Did you or someone you know offered this type of service and did it attract people in you price range or barging hunters only? Any info is appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: Since there were some questions about our portfolio here is our website so you guys can see for your self: www.visualmastersstudio.com

Prices that we offer are competitive in my opinion. We are not shooting for a top tear market but yet, but we don't want the bottom feeders ether. Middle-class fresh young professionals are what we are going for.

<TEXT> We know they didn't have a contact with the aircraft, but what I don't understand is how come they didn't see that flight losing altitude before going of the radar. Looking at the timeline they should have appeared in to Vietnam air traffic control at 1:22am. Malaysian air traffic control lost contact with the flight at 2:41am I know they can't pinpoint location, but based two oil spills and last radar reading they should have good idea of where they should look for it.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking in to purchasing condo and I started so look online to get the idea of what is in my price range. Most of the sites list asking price only and don't include things such as maintenance and taxes. I was wondering if there is real-estate website that will list all of the expenses associated with any given listing. 

One more question. How is closing cost calculated and how much can I expect to pay for it? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm really proud of what Celtics are doing right now. It looks like Brad Stevens and the bunch of bench players, rookies and over payed has beens was not told enough times that they suck. Yes, they don't look good on the court together and the " stars " of the team have more bad games than good ones but it looks to me like they started to figure stuff out. I'm not saying they will make playoffs this year or that they will be relevant team in the next 2-3 years, but I do want to give them a credit for working together and competing every single game.  </TEXT>

co-worker : Because you are from Europe "

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So this is my pet peeve. I get it he is a good player and he can win a mayor but compared to these three tennis greats he is just another player. He has been around for as long as Djokovic and his accomplishments are not even close to any of these 3 players. In my opinion he still needs to prove him self as world number# 1 and hold that position for at least a year or two before we can legitimately consider him tennis great and include him in to the " Big 4 " phrase. After all tennis is competitive sport and not a popularity contest.  </TEXT>

To be honest I liked most of the vehicles on this list for one reason or the other. Only ones I really didn't care about were Mazda 929 and PT cruiser. I know that none of these cars is a chick magnet but overall they are not that ugly are they?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was just reading some article about A-Rod and 8 other players about to be banned from MLB. I love the game of Basketball but it bothers me that NBA is the only one of mayor 3 team sports in USA that does not pay attention to HGH and other performance-enhancing drugs. Every once in the while we hear that some has been like Hedo Turkoglu was suspended for like 6 month or something like that. 
 In my opinion they will have to do something about it sooner or later and I would really hate to see some champions, allstars   hall of famers in the same situation that A-Rod and Barry Bonds are in right now.   </TEXT>
