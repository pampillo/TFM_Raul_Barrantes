<TEXT> Aristotle sparked the Islamic scientific movement. He was hailed by Muslim scholars as the "first teacher". Muslim scholars utilized his ideas and teachings to expand further on the scientific method. This includes everything from the classification of plants and animals. To biology. There isn't a single field of scientific study that Aristotle not only touched upon, expanded, but most he even founded. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course that's your contention. I'm a first-year grad student; and just got finished reading some Roman historian, Pete Garrison probably. I'm gonna be convinced of that 'till next month when I get to James Lemon. Then I'm going to be talking about how the economies of Rome and Greece were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740 B.C.. That's gonna last until next year; then I'm gonna be in this subreddit regurgitating Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know, the pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Ten Dollar Bill </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 15:28:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am nobody. Some people lead brilliant lives. Lives of color and achievement. Bright bursts of red, pillars of yellow light. You know, when you look at someone and they seem to just shine. People around them say "That person's going to be someone someday. Real Potential." I'm primer gray.

I have no family; I think the only person that knows my last name is the man that signs my paycheck. I live in a town beat down by progress. The old folks around here only seem to ever speak in the past tense. How great the town used to be before the mines shutdown. They are walking shadows like me. They see the world how it used to be. They don't see a boarded-up storefront on Main street. They see the soda fountain where they had their first kiss. They see the old grocery store where their mothers used to send them for condensed milk. They see the color in the shadow. I wish I was old like them. I'd like to see the color. But that is not who I am.

There is only one gas station left in town. It's old and rusty. I work there. Work if you want to call it that. Most of the time I just sit here and watch the dust collect. Little boxes of spark plugs for cars that probably don't even exist anymore. Gas cans always borrowed and never bought. The only things that aren't covered in dust are the cigarettes and beer. I'm probably a chief contributor to their popularity.

I space out most of the time. The world of sounds and things just blur away. I like watching the dust dance in the shafts of the dusk light. It's like an endless stream slowly floating in the air darting around here and there. My own breath the puppeteer of their dance. It all ends so quickly. My own little world seems to collapse in on itself with the ring of the little bell above the door shattering it. The dust blown away by a gust of air. I get torn from the peace of the light back to my grey world.

"ten on two. Keep the change." That's all the man said that walked in and broke my daydreaming. I take the bill, ring the register open, and flip the pump on. I watch him walk out. A little overdressed for this place. A crisp suit that seems to be equally black and dark blue. 'Must be rich if he overpays this much for gas.' I thought. A black watch on his right hand that glints the sun as he reaches for the door to open it. He walks out of my world as quickly as he walked into it.

The ten bill he gave me was old and wrinkly. I pull it taught on the edge of the register to try and snap it straight. As I hold it up to see If I got all the wrinkles out the date catches my eye. I hold the bill up to the light. Sure enough, the bill says "Series 1995". I glance over at Helena. She's Miss June on this years pin up calendar from 1969.

I sit there for a few seconds. Just staring at the date. It must be a fake bill, seen plenty of those. I stand up and try to look out of the stained windows at the man. His car already starting to drive out. A black Cadillac DeVille convertible. I've seen it around town before. A new car stands out in a place like this. Im sure Ive seen in walking back to my shithole apartment gleaming under the lights of the Motel 8 down the road. Bad counterfeiter to get the date this wrong. 

Just passed midnight. A couple people from out of town and the local drunks my only company this night. I close shop and hit the breakers for lights outside. I count today's take. The ten bill from the suit sitting on the counter. Its staring at me. I pocket it. Toss the rest of the days cash in a used too many times yellow envelope and slam it in the safe. 

The night is damp and ugly for a walk down Blacklog road. Every so often the lights from a passing car or the moon crashing through a break in the clouds light my way. To cars and the moon, Im just a shadow on the side of the road. The swinging glow of my cigarette the only proof of my existence. Eventually I stand in the faint orange glow of the Super 8 sign, and sure enough theres the Cadillac. I feel around in my jeans pocket for the ten bill, sliding it around with my fingers. I can see the lights are still on in the room next to the Cadillac. I guess passing fake bills all day in backwater Inez isnt exactly tiring work. The rest of the motel is dark. Im like a moth to the flame I stand there and stare at the door. Room 7. 

Ive had a few too many run-ins with the law to go calling them. But there is no way Im explaining ten short to the boss. I hate my job, but it keeps beer in the fridge. This shits going to pay. I make way up to the door. Just as I pass the Cadillac I stop. A wall of fear hits me in the chest. It was like turning a corner and suddenly seeing a gun in your face. This unexplainable feeling of dread. There is nothing here, why cant I move? The fear hits me in predictable waves. Eating away at me like a stone at the shore. It takes all my resolve and energy just to raise my eyes from the ground. I can see into the room, and passed it. Its two realities smashing into each other like train cars. A field one second, a room another. Day, then back to night. I feel like my body is being torn apart. Standing in an invisible rift. The pace of the waves slow. I want my knees to buckle. I want nothing more than to fall onto the wet pavement. As suddenly as the waves hit me they stopped. I give in to the will of my body and let gravity do its work. I never thought the ground could feel this good.

Im sure I passed out at this point. When I came to I was in a strange bed. I felt like I just laid four miles of track. This is a problem. a voice said. The world around me is just coming into focus.


I know. Another voice answered.

 
Ill take care of it. I heard that loud and clear.


I looked down at my body and saw the straps. I was tied into the bed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basic income will fail. Communism failed. People and society do not work this way. There will always be rich people propped up by the work of the poor. No matter how many creative ways you find to shift this paradigm (labor, manufacturing to poor countries paying poor wages) you are simply outsourcing the poor. Where there once was Kings and Lords, there are now CEO Billionaires and CEO Millionaires. The only difference is that the law aspect has shifted from the Rich to the government...governments that are easily corrupted by the rich to serve themselves. 


We never learn anything from our history. Rome crumbled and fell due to greed and corruption. Over generations the Rich kept on getting richer and greedier that eventually they owned all the land. And since only landowners could be true Romans and join the military the empire fell. No military to maintain the empire, means no money coming in. The Rich destroyed themselves and everyone else's lives with their greed.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Legend of H3h3 (A true story) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-19 08:36:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There is a legend buried deep inside history


Going back to the dawn of man

 
A curve of magnificent beauty, of mathematical perfection


The very mathematical allegory of the human perception of beauty


Those few who have glimpsed an understanding of this mystery have created magnificent masterpieces. From the west, there is the Mona Lisa, Michelangelos the last supper, the Parthenon, Donald Trump. From the east, there is Hokusai the Tsunami, the Taj Mahal, Sonic the Hedgehog.


They all share a mysterious force that binds them together...the golden ratio, the Fibonacci.


To find the answer to the ultimate question I would have to travel the world, and interview the greatest minds.


I began my adventure with the renown genius Reddit user Slasher6969.


"tell me of your credentials Slasher6969" I PMd him.


"Please please, just call me Doc Slasher." he replied.


"I have an honorary doctorates degree from the mods of /r/health."


"Honorary?" I questioned him.


"Yes, but I am more of a doctor than any real doctor. How many doctors do you know that do over 1200 hours a week of Reddit research?" He sniped back.


"but...there are only 169 hours a week?" I asked after querying Siri.


"Exactly..."


I was clearly impressed by his credentials. He had over 6 front page posts in the last 3 months, and only 5 of them where reposts. His Karma was nearly at unheard of levels. He requested a Skype video chat.


"I know the answers that you seek, but..." he shied away from the camera "my intellect is not nearly enough."


"Butbut you are one of the most brilliant minds on Reddit. Over 12K up votes just this week. If you don't have the answers, then who does?" I asked.


Doc Slasher began to speak in whispered tones.


"There is another. No one knows where he lives. Rumor has it he has been training in the art of the Katana in the Himalayas. But he has returned from his study of the blade. His intellect is so great it takes FOUR fedoras to contain it."


"you can't possibly mean...?" I gasped. Nearly dropping my vape.


"yes...yes the legendary Quad-dora." Doc Said, rising his arms in the air.


"you mean you have found him??" I asked.


"Yes. It was the culmination of my life's work of reddit stalking. I was finally able to track him down. You will find him just outside of Pompeii."


"Pompeii? the lost destroyed city?" I asked.


"No, pom-pay-eye...Michigan. about 100 miles north west of Detroit. Here is his address" He PMd me the address.


I immediately dawned the best body armor I owned, and booked a flight on a United Airlines to Pompeii Michigan.


After hours of Siri giving me the wrong directions, I finally arrived at his secret underground compound cleverly disguised as a suburban two and half bath ranch home.


His gatekeeper answered the door. She went by the name of Ms. Stevenson. She took one look at me, obviously impressed by my sense of style and fedora, and quickly ushered me inside. She directed me to a door that led down into the underground compound. How did she know I was coming? I wondered.


I walked the stepped passage down into the darkness.


As I turned the corner is was like the resurrection of Christ, I was blinded by the sheer light from all the monitors.


Cast in their shadow I saw him...the cloaked figure sitting in a meditative state...the legendary Quad-dora.


"I have been expecting you..." He said without even opening his eyes.


He turned in his chair, the light gleamed off his perfectly polished Naruto Leaf Village Jnin headband. I could make out the pair of Katanas strapped to his back.


Clearly noticing my sense of fear, he spoke.


"You need not worry." he assured me. "I only draw my blades to strike down darkness, to defend the innocent and m'ladies."

"You must forgive me" I spoke, "I have heard the legends that you can draw and reseat you blades before the enemy even know they are dead." I spoke carefully.

"yes yes this is true. Now...why have you sought my guidance?"


I showed him the evidence I had gathered. The Mona Lisa, the Trump, the Parthenon. His gatekeeper, Ms. Stevenson, clearly a practitioner of Kung-Fu, brought us hors doeuvres of Totino's pizza rolls as we poured over the evidence.


"Yes yes, I am familiar with this subject. I have many reposts on this subject matter. Even some that have garnered Reddit gold." The Quad-dora spoke.


"With all your research, your honorable legendary Quad-dora, have you found an answer? I queried.


"Yes...yes I have."


I was shocked. I knew his intellect was amazing, according to multiple Facebook IQ tests he was rating over 200, but to be so close to the answer.


"Come with me."


He rose from his meditative pose and directed us down the hall.


"I know the one you seek, the embodiment of the Fibonacci."


He caught me glimpsing his collections.


"Ah yes, gaze upon my armory. The finest collection of Katana and Nerf Guns this side of the Mississippi. I call this one Sheyla." He picked up a large Nerf sniper rifle "customized it myself, illegal spring kit from North Korea, lethal up to 1000 yards. Dart catcher, picatinny rail, red dot scope, and laser."


It was glorious.


"But this" he pointed at a sword protected by a display case "the pride of my collection. The original sword used in the anime Ao no Exorcist...Rin Okumuras swordKurikara." I leaned toward it to get a better look.


"CAREFUL" he cautioned. "even the slightest touch of its blade can kill." I slowly backed away in respect.


"but back to the task at hand." Quad-dora motioned down the hall.


He briskly walked us passed his anime collection, his complete Nintendo collection. We took a left at his Pokmon card collection directly to a set of double doors.


"The one you seek goes by many names; for he has many faces. The founder of greatest empire known to man. Legend says he was born a virgin birth in Israel. He started life as a reposter, much like I. But he transcended. He is the one."


"you don't mean? I gasped.


"Yes, he is an OC... a creator of memes. Born in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five. He has over 9000 likes on YouTube and he is a verified non-virgin." He said.


"what??...I though only a Chad could transcend to non-virgin??" I asked in shock.


"Before the one, that was true. His wife is of the house Hakmon. A legendary beauty, painter and original content creator of her own. It is said on their wedding night a thousand white horses manifested out of thin air in the deserts of the holy land."


"truly amazing!" I gasped. "who is this legend?"


"he is the Papa Bless, creator of the Naysh of Vape, he is the living embodiment of memes, the judge of all goofs, gags, and gaffs, H3h3 Ethan Bradberry Klein!


As he spoke he swung open the double set of doors to reveal his shrine to H3h3 Ethan. His shrine to the glory of it all was too much and I fainted.


When I awoke, I was outside. The sun warmed my skin for the first time in years. I watched the clouds pass overhead wondering if it was all a dream. Did I meet the Quad-dora? Was is all just a hallucination? I felt a note pinned to my chest.


Is simply read. "There is only one place on Earth where a God could walk among us. The one you seek now lives in the city of fallen angels." The paper was embossed with a crest of a fedora crossed by two Katana swords.


"IT WAS REAL!!" I yelled.


I donned by body armor and extra padding and prepared to board the first United Airlines flight to Californ-nye-aye.


There I would seek the legendary Ethan Klein, the creator, the one, the papa bless H3h3.


My journey would be cut short. The answers I seek must be too strong. Was it the illuminati? The Knights Templar? The East Lansing Michigan homeowners association? Perhaps even the Freemasons? Whoever it was they wield great power and influence.


The United Airlines check-in counter lady informed me I was out of good boy points. My card had been declined...she beat me with my own carry-on bag for wasting her time. An entire year of taking the trash out without complaining down the drain. I returned home, sullen, broken, not even my favorite dinner of chicken tendies could absolve me. I must find the answer.


I scoured the entire internet for answers. I left no sub reddit unturned. And just when I was about to give up hope I received a PM. It was from the legendary Quad-dora. "You think in so few dimensions. Do not look at the obvious, the simple plane, you must broaden your horizons, into the third dimension."


It was just the spark of innovation I needed. Thank the gods for his massive intellect. I sought out the most powerful supercomputer in all of Lansing Michigan. The PowerMac G4 at the library. With all the porn surfing hobos it could be weeks before I get allotted a time slot. 


There must be another wayThere was one other wayI would have to trespass onto the hallowed grounds a near console peasant like me would never dare to. I would have to seek the help of a member of the Master Race. The PC Master Race.


Since I was a mere child I have heard the whispers. A child, a prodigy, he took apart a clock and was nearly invited to the Whitehouse. Legend says he actually wields not only the Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker but also the Warglaives of Azzinoth! I told my mother I'll take the tendies to go. I had to seek out a rank one Global elite!


I went two blocks down to Kyle's house. Kyle was his birth name, he preferred Anon now. He belonged to a cult called the 4chan. A mysterious group of hackers that claim to be the origin of the meme. I took one last draw from my vape, blew a sick ass cloud, and walked up to his door.


As I reached up to knock, the door suddenly blew open. It was glorious. He seemed to be illuminated in RGB lighting from behind so bright it was blinding. His golden locks of hair flowed effortlessly in the light breeze. Body of a Greek Twitch streamer. I looked up at him with a sudden feeling of inferiority. What am I doing here? A mere console peasant should not dare to gleam a god like this.


"Ha ho How did you know I was here?" I stuttered.


"The camera," He pointed at the IP camera above the door. "Fucking newfag. Well you gonna come in or just brick like an Xbox 360 on my stoup?"


"How do you know who I am?" I asked cautiously as I followed inside. Through his shirt I could see his back muscles bristle like pythons trapped in a bag.


"I'm a leet haxor, /fit/izen and /b/tard from the land of 4chan you fucking console peasant. Also, some fag named Quad-dora whispered me in WOW said you were coming." How will I ever thank the legendary Quad-dora.


We entered his room on the second floor of the house. I had never been this high up. Vertigo began setting in.


His room was stacked floor to ceiling with e-sports trophies.


"Is that...oh my god." My eyes fell onto a sight so incredibly beautiful.


"Yup. Frostmourne. Legendary sword of King Arthas, the lich king." It was truly amazing.


"What's that in the little box next to it?" I asked.


"The little thumb drive? Yeah that's the actual Sword of a Thousand Truths. I had to suck off a GM for that a Blizzcon last year...literally." I feel to my knees in its presence. A sword of untold power just two blocks from my home. What an honor.


"So what is it that you need from me mortal." He sneered.


"I need to use your computer, I heard it is even more powerful than the PowerMac G4 at the library."


"You insult my rig by comparing it to that Mac trash! And what do you think, Im just going to hand all this PC power over to youa console peasant? Just like that? You see those keys there? 


He pointed at his fully custom key capped keyboard.


Those custom keys are hand carved from molars of Korean StarCraft Players that I defeated at illegal underground tournaments. You are not worthy


I beg you! You must help me. I turned and presented myself to him but he turned away.


What do you need it for anyway? He asked.


I need it to answer the ultimate question. I need it to render a 3d model of the meme God H3h3 Ethan.


He laughed at my face.


Oh sure whats next, you want a live computational model of every molecule in the universe? You cant just PC model a god you fool. He continued to mock me.


Dammit Anon we must try! I cried out dropping to my knees pulling at his glorious zipper.


He swiped my hands away like a child reaching for a cookie jar. Fine, but were gonna have to go 4-way SLI for this one4-way Titans


He allowed me to sit in the corner on the floor and watch him work. The legend of his technical knowledge was understated. He truly is the one who was almost invited to the Whitehouse for taking apart a clock. His fingers moved so quickly I could barely keep up. 

A few hours later he was finished.


I call it Quantum Hydra. He spoke in soft tones. The machine powered to life with the sparks of a thousand RGB lights. The fans whirred to full power.


Oh my god it sounds like the I whispered.


Yes, he finished my sentence. Chidori, One Thousand Birds.


He opened a program on the machine I had never seen before. He casually scrolled through a list of a thousand items.


What is that? I asked.


Its Steam, He said. those are all games. Lord Gaben is good to us.


I had never seen so many games.


We worked for hours on end. I had my mother deliver tendies to me to keep me awake. Anon drank only imported Mountain Dew from Korea and feasted on Doritos of flavors I had never even heard of.


After pouring over all the archival footage of The Meme God H3h3 Ethan our work was nearly done.


We are ready to render. Anon said. Im afraid my machine alone will not be enoughI will put out a call-to-arms to the entire PC Master Race.


He opened a program called IRC, apparently, an ancient method of communication from the dawn of the PCMR. And he sent up a signal. And now we wait He said.


A few minutes passed and then suddenly thousands of confirmations began streaming in from all around the world. Russia, Germany, Korea all the elite gamers heeded our call to action. Anon hacked all the machines together.


It is done. The most powerful computer network in the history of the worldall this power at my fingertips. Anon trembled. 


We are ready to render a Meme GOD!! He screamed as he hit enter.


Around the globe thousands of gaming rigs screamed at once as their water-cooled GPUs maxed out in the computation. NASA reported being able to see spikes of RGB lighting from space.


We need more power! Anon yelled into his custom Corsair headset. Korea, divert power from the StarCraft servers! I could hear the complaints even from the floor.


Still not enough power Anon gasped. Netherlands divert all torrent processing from the Pirate bay!


I could see a needle swing to 85% on his screen. It wasnt enough.


Anon looked down on me from his gaming throne. He looked exhausted and defeated.


Thats all we havewethere are no more GPUs


Just then, a single solitary message popped up on the screen from IRC. The message read Perhaps I can lend a hand. -Lord Gaben


Holy shit. The lord. Anon gasped. Just then the needle shot to 100%! The computer flashed RENDER COMPLETE.


We did it. With the power of Steam lord Gaben himself he pushed the render to completion. It was done. We have rendered the Meme God H3h3 Ethan.


Cortana! Anon yelled. Yes master. His computer replied.


Begin analysis of the 3d render of Meme God H3h3 Ethan.


His personal Ai popped up on the screen I will need your assistance with the mathematical equations Anon.


Anon typed furiously on his keyboard. A thousand lines of code flashed by on his screen as the render of the Meme god came to life. As the 3d model turned, the universe seemed to come into alignment.


We all saw it at once. The answer was right there. 

Cortana confirm what we are seeing against the Fibonacci sequence. Anon commanded his PC. 

The golden ratio spiraled. It was a perfect match. We have found the Alpha and the Omega. Coexisting in a single being.


It had been staring me in the face the entire time. The FUPA. The Chub and tuck. It was mathematical perfection. The golden ratio spiral matched its side profile perfectly. He was truly a living meme. A god amongst us mere mortals.  A single tear fell from Anons face.


It has been a thousand years since a PCMR has criedI have never seen anything so beautiful. Anon sobbed.


There was a moment of silence.

The bottom space is reserved for the elderly and handicapped, since there are no bathrooms on this configuration, they are most likely not to be able to hold their bowles for the duration of the flight. So for the comfort of the other passengers they will be placed at the bottom of the stack. Some concessions must be made for customer satisfaction. The walking space between the seat stacks is reserved for cabin crew to allow enough room to properly beat unruly passengers during re-accommodations.  </TEXT>

Next you gonna need some bear traps.

Next tie the whole thing together with a used Federal Signal Thunderbolt 1003 Civil Defense siren. Everyone ignores house alarms or car alarms. Trust me, ain't no one in a 3 mile radius of your apartment going to ignore a Thunderbolt 1003 going off. People will come if out of sheer annoyance to your aid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iWFDuZdb4

<TEXT> Look security systems are a scam. Go down to your local hunting supply outlet and buy bear traps. Bear traps are the best security you could ever want. They don't sleep. They don't eat. There is no monthly fee. They will never stop. They will never leave you, and it would never hurt you, never shout at you, or get drunk and hit you, or say it was too busy to spend time with you. It would always be there. And it would die, to protect you. Of all the would-be Security Systems who came and went over the years, this bear trap, this machine, was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was the sanest choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The average NYPD cop makes $44,744 a year so that's roughly $186.00 per day (working 48 weeks/yr at 5 days per week). Lets figure in a $50/day equipment depreciation, vehicle maintenance, fuel cost per officer. So $266 per day per officer. Let's say they have 100 people in the security team. That's $26,000 per day. To account for overtime let's double that figure to $53K per day. Let's add $1000 per day per officer just for the hell of it. That brings our total to $153K per day. How in the hell is this costing $400K per day?? And I was just throwing money at it and I couldn't reasonably hit $400K.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kibble tame a lot of 150 rexes...breed the ones with the best stats. Rinse and repeat with the breed ones. We use the best male to mate with all the best females. Inbreeding helps with mutations obviously, so we try to breed daughters with the father again etc to get mutation in the que. Than we stack same generation with mutations into the next generation. Between generations e.g.: Gen 4 and Gen 5 there are in between generation breedings. So like Gen 4 father mating with the Gen 4-1 (as we call it) daughters to stack the mutations. Then we breed the best gen 4-X male with the gen 4-X females to produce gen 5. That way you get the best of both worlds the mutation carry over and the best natural stat carry over. To get to gen 6 we have probably breed over 70 or so rexes (EDIT per line, my tribe has 4 lines going right now). The shit ones go to the arena for boss fights! More Tek stuff! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wearing the same shirt as zoo keepers...yeah not going to work on most animals. Animals at a zoo know their familiars or zookeepers by proximity, size, scent and location rather than color. Zookeepers are generally the only ones to enter the pens. They tend to also mainly be adults. Besides Giraffes, there aren't any large mammals that can distinguish colors very well. African apes and monkeys can see as well as humans. South American monkeys are near dichromatic (red color difficulty). Elephants, Hippos, Lions, Tigers, Wolves, (weak dichromats) most rodents are dichromatic and so are fish. Interestingly Rats are Blue, Green and Ultraviolet sensitive. Reptiles are all over the place with some snakes that can see both dichromatic colors and infrared. Frogs are weak dichromats. Birds have the most enhanced color vision at 5-7 colors of common Zoo animals.  Mantis shrimp is the crustacean exception with 16 color receptor cones. Most other crustaceans have Blue/Red cones. Cephalopods see blue only...crazy to think that an almost color blind animal can imitate all colors so well. This one blows my mind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK don't listen to people who say bring dinos AND rpgs...your just going to end up killing your own dinos. Here is how my tribe is doing all the way up to hard mode. We bring 18 rexes and 2 Theraz (we have a Therizin breeder so normally I would not recommend but his a god like now). Rex Stats: 40-80K Health (recommend 60K for almost guaranteed survival), 800 Mele Min., 1K recommended. Therizin are 60K Health 1300 mele. High Quality Saddles on all dinos. We use Master Craft Saddles on all Rex's seems to work just fine. Set all fight dinos to "Attack my Target" We bring 3-4 people, gear doesn't matter dress for the environment. Teleport into arena, "J" call the cluster fuck of dinos into a good position (in the bottom pit for Broodmother, Back of tele area for Ape (kite ape down with a rifle then move command dinos and players back away let tank rex's corner him), up the dumb ramp and into the open for Dragon). THEN get on your command dinos. Whistle game from here on it. Each person have pre-assigned Rex's to their dino group. So J calls, Passive, AMT whistles only affect their group. If you get the positioning right (AKA trap boss in a ball of rexes) it's a cake walk. We have only lost 2 rexes with this strat on Dragon due to a positioning F-up; Rex's getting stuck on rocks etc when coming back from air to ground phase. Manticore is another story altogether...14 or so high level Lightning Wyverns, Heavy armor gear, High quality armor piercing weapons for players. Wyverns FF the Manticore, players just play bodyguard for wyverns that pass out. Killing Death Worms and Elementals from the starting platform, and kiting them away from passed out wyverns. Bring lots of food, blood bags, soups and stimulant etc. As of right now you can avoid Manticore (get tek grams from other bosses) I would recommend that. Deadliest part of this strat is a Lightening wyverns coming into range of players. They will TK you... </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I went to the website and did the little challenge. 

I found a few hidden elements. One is the quote "BETWEEN SUBTLE SHADING AND THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT LIES THE NUANCE OF IQLUSION" which is a reference to the solution of Kryptos Stage 1 (that art/statue at CIA HQ). 

Stage one was a Vigenre cipher...so that may be a hint to something. It may just have been obvious and point out the hidden banana on the page...and the banana phone song. Not sure. 

Third was the hidden FSociety mask behind the server panel.  

http://imgur.com/gallery/S7dRW. 

As others have figured that out the "XITXITXITXITXITXITXIT" if the Kryptos is any clue, it may actually be " IT IT IT IT IT IT IT" as the artist that made it used the letter "X" in the decoded cipher of Stage 2 for "esthetic reasons" which also was a Vigenre cipher. Big stretch here...

Besides that, the background of the image has their logo in the center (G or TG for The Gathering) which is surrounded by what appears to a decoder wheel. Bottom right hand corner has a box I can't make anything else out besides a few random letters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Red army time to flex, sportin hulk hogan style pecks, ready to bring wreaks

of a bygone era reborn for the modern world, let our children live it too,fist ready to hurl

down destruction at a nuclear pace, rearm this nuclear race

like a sprint to the river styx, no coin in hand for the man turning da tricks

it's like we all forget, Charon's in charge, the baron von swear in

the new president, relations on the rocks, soldiers in camo cleaning out glocks

seems like war these days is the only answer, there's no cure in sight for this political cancer

cut it out like a tumor again and again, we resort to baser instincts of lesser men

we allow to leads us, to a flaming wall mislead us

if destruction of our world is the goal why wait? open the flood gate, 

we need no Arks for this ride of apocalypse, the sands of time run low in drips

maybe our time is done, no hope in the setting sun, for in a war that cannot be won

listen to Joshua, 

The only winning move is not to play. If you want to live past this d-day

so lets stop making all these arms, putting out children in harms

way to the future, stich this dark suture of destruction, life hostage holding abduction

Set the pace China build new peace for the human race

don't give in to the hate, walk the path of Siddhartha be great </TEXT>

<TEXT> **I remember the days so clearly**

When Martin and Malcolm walked

The streets flooded dark in color from city block to block

Unified voices shouting the same message

Speaking truth that rings so clear like bullet presage

Like Sisko back in Twenty Twenty-four 

I feel like I have awaken in past tense horror

Looking for hope on the horizon of the future scope

Graspin at memories past looking for hope

Hope of freedom, equality, digging my mind to understand this political causality

Everything we fought, bleed and placed chains on to bind us

Lady liberty stood tall to blind us

Emancipation proclamations words ring so hollow

truth and reality getting harder swallow, Looking for a moon shot of hope ride the wings of Apollo

Into the future that Sisko lived, all men equal no color of skin

Where the Merritt and actions of man are the fireing pin, and you'll know when

The cartridge in the gun of revolution triggered by the pen

will write the words in the social consciousness

where the word equality won't be played like chess

Where truth trumps ignorance, no more moron hinderance,

In the way for Trek like world where all wings can unfurl and all men are best

this I pray for, cast prejudice aside for, hug my brothers of all colors for the glimpse of the hope killing Klingon's with no scopes

unprovoked war for a naval base let face it, you can go back and trace it

strategic location for the soviet fleet, nukes on preheat, looking for a place to make Blyat!

Ukraine government on downfall, time to move in on the throne like after Thrall

Adidas tracksuits on check, poopin squats in the snow with my comrades on fleck

We called separatists, better drop that shit in parenthesis

we not Russian army regulars, Putin's not flipping this bill like a creditor

Bum rush the artillery like a predator, AK locked and loaded ready like a whity redditor

Stale mate the EU writtin nasty letters to Putin, you know them bitches aint gonna put a boot in

Ukraine gonna have to step up, give mother Russia a quick check up

Soviet era is gone, we aint no pushover, we'll stand in defense of our lands till its all over

Lower your arms Putin, we aint gonna stop shootin

Take "The Rape of Proserpina" by Italian sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini. At over 2 meters tall and carved from a single block of marble by hand it is undoubtedly one of the greatest masterpieces ever to be created by humanity. It took Bernini one year to make. He was 23 when he made it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You see that's the problem. All these pseudo intellectuals regurgitating others knowledge and not actually creating or doing anything. Let me teardown your post one by one.  "I literally can't think of a single genuinely intellectual Trump supporter" You need to broaden your horizons. Utilizing  "literally" and "single" makes this statement one that is subjective rather than objective. This statement clearly indicates that even if a person generally falls into the category of  an  "intellectual" in your frame of reference if they are also a Trump supporter that this is an impossibility. Since they do not agree with you, their mindset must be incorrect. This is a logical fallacy.  "displayed an aggressive disinterest in critical thinking"    "employing the most basic, middle-school level reading and writing skills" First, the irony of stating middle school writing skills and then  proceeding in the same sentence to incorrectly hyphenate "middle-school". Second, what is aggressive disinterest? How does one actively seek impartiality? This is one of those phrases that sound great, but make no logical sense.  "they were informed and they had the best interest of the country in mind."  "for 30 years now, I've watched the Right getting progressively more belligerent, more crass and more interested in ideology than in empirical fact." That's quite some mental gymnastics here. Is the GOP "informed" or are they "ignorant"?  "it's only going to get worse before it gets better." Oh I love these. Another one of those "sounds good" statements that state the complete obvious in a riddle like manner. You also started both sentences in your last statement with "And". Also something you would have learned in middle school. I guess it's not just the GOP or Trump supporters with  "basic, middle-school level reading and writing skills" </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tusoteuthis issues on Center Map (Post tame) </TITLE>

<TEXT> Tusoteuthis issues on Center Map. The first one we tamed died just 15min after taming due to a slow damage tick. There was nothing attacking it (not it combat) Had a 300lvl mosa as a guard. We had three people pumping meat into it to try to keep it alive, moved it into our water pen. Nothing worked. It just slowly died. We wrote it off as a strange glitch. Second tamed Tusoteuthis is still alive, but locked in place after moving it to just outside our water pen. It swims in "reverse" (tentacles facing forward) really slowly. Won't follow other dinos or survivors. When you dismount it after slow moving it for awhile it just rubber bands you back to where you started. On your screen you see it move, other see you just sitting on it in the same place. Also tried claiming and reclaiming it. Seems like some sort of server stasis issue. We all logged out of stasis range...still no joy. Waiting for a server restart to see if that fixes it. (Center Map, Un-official server 4x Exp, 3x T, 3x R, Mods: CS, S+, Fabulous Hair Mod (for the ladies on the server...), Egg Collector Mod) </TEXT>

You're probably thinking "You can't build a military base that big that is ridiculous." And you would be correct. But on paper you can. No why would you need a paper base thousands of miles wide along the boarder? Think Trump. What is the greatest patriot of all. He never sleeps, he never hungers, he is perpetually vigilant and on guard. Willing to give his live at a moment's notice to protect our great nation. The humble landmine. But wait! Geneva convention! Ohhhh paper military base...it's not a minefield, it's a ordnance disposal yard. Now your thinking Trump. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funny, but fake. Look at the source of the poop emanation. And remember that a dogs anus is at the base of the tail and not well below the hip. The angle of the poop shot is all wrong based on the body position of the dog. The sputtering effect of the fluid is indicative of pneumatic pressure drop of a non-compressible fluid. AKA there is a pipe filled with chocolate pudding behind and slightly underneath the dog. A person blew into the other end of the pipe to shoot the stream out. The reaction of the dog helps to confirm this. First he looks to the rear at the source of the sound, than he turns directly forward toward the location where I am guessing the "pipe blower" is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Teleporter/replicator are based on the same basic tech just implemented for different purposes. Transporter limit is generally 40,000 kilometers. I think the limit would be on the energy side and practicality. Why not have a 1000 industrial replicators and a 1000 teleporters working in unison. Replicate the part, then teleport it in place. Rinse and repeat until the ship is built. Since replicators can pre-determine temperature why not replicate a beam with "hot ends" that when teleported to the assembly in orbit automatically welds into place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a store thief. Poor-ish family. Used to steal Lego kits from stores. I'd say about 80% of my Lego's were stolen. I used to yell "Mama" and run through the checkout lane sneak grab a bag. I was misdirecting before I even knew what it meant. Then go to the toys section load it up and just walk out with it. I also stole Uberraschung Eier by the shit ton (I mean we literally would dump a full tray of them in a bag and walk out). Looking for those mini monster truck windup cars and the Metal Medieval figures. Stole so may of those I actually started to throw the chocolate away (got sooo sick of it). Eventually my racket came crashing down when my parents got suspicious of all the new toys I had and a friend of mines father came into the store and caught us in the act. In the end I probably stole $1K of Lego's, a couple hundred of misc toys, and about $400 of Kinder Uberraschung Eier.  </TEXT>

For 8th grade graduation Ben shaved his eyebrows, dyed his hair orange, and wore a burnt orange suit. Good times. Last I heard (a year or two ago) he was in prison for slinging dope.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> These images are actually of the first effects shots for Star Wars. When George saw them he was appalled at the poor quality and cheesy look that he reshot all of them. He said if he left them in they would have ruined the movie. He scrapped all of the effects shots and started from the ground up supervising the entire process. This eventually lead to the development of ILM.

I'm freaking out and without even thinking I dab her chest with a napkin apologizing profusely. Then I freak out and start apologizing even more realizing I had basically just groped her. She was so sweet about it. Didn't think anything of it. Here I am a lowly 3/10 in a place I don't belong speaking to the most beautiful woman I have ever meet and we are totally hitting it off. And then, just like in the movies, her boyfriend Chad comes up and that's it. What did you actually think the nerd gets the girl? get the fuck out of here.

<TEXT> I call this the Smiling Asshole. 
First off the person making your sandwich is hard of hearing and possible doesn't speak English. It does not matter if the artist was born in Wisconsin and enunciates the English language perfectly at a proper volume, to you they are deaf and foreign. Therefor you must speak loudly and repeat everything twice with emphasis. 

Flat bread, make sure to mention your intolerance for gluten, Pepperoni, South West Sauce, no Cheese (the treatment of cows in the dairy industry is atrocious be sure to mention this loudly and look around to make sure everyone heard you). Add as many jalapenos that is legally allowed to be placed on a flatbread. Lettuce, and then insist on having it toasted. You like hot welted lettuce.

Then ask for another piece of flatbread on top, look them square in the eyes, and say now make it smile with sriracha. Ask them to draw a smiley face on it. Never break eye contact. Never look at the sandwich. When they ask "Is this enough?" you say "More...MOOOREEE." Never break eye contact. This is war. There can be only one winner. Push that sauce to the limit. You want that flatbread to look like Sansa's wedding night sheets. When it's all set and done proclaim, "I guess you really are an artist." Pay with change if you are a guy, or slightly moist dollar bills pulled from your bra if you're a woman. 

Edit: Oh forgot to add. After you are done paying tell them you that you know that you can be a pain. Pull a $20 bill out of your pocket, look like you are about to put it into the tip jar. Then use your thumb to slide a penny out from behind the bill and let it drop into the tip jar. Pocket the twenty and walk away. </TEXT>

Opie asked him "What did you just say?" The homeless man replied "If you really had a time-machine why didn't you just get the lottery numbers?...dumb asses."

They should have all been in prosthetic and makeup to look like Jeremy (played by the Ginger guy), James (the German woman), and Richard (the guy from Friends). The should have lip synced to recordings of their voices from old shows (all things the BBC can do since they own the rights) and do terrible impressions of their voices. Totally pretend like this is what they are going to do from here on out. Kinda like Chef from South Park. Do the news like this, and a little something else (don't let the crowd in on it, let them stay in the shock they would have been in). Then do some kind of reveal like "Ok guys, this isn't going to work" and tear off the makeup and prosthetics "its way too hot in all this crap. Can't we just do a show about all the ridiculous sports cars we are all passionate about?" Then just walk it off like it was a bad idea. And go on with the show a new. Skip all this shit about "reliving" past episodes with the laser crap and the Reliant Robins. That is British comedy. That would have been amazing to see.  </TEXT>

Asking "Hey how do I get this to work?" the answer usually is "Oh that's been broken for a while now, no joy compare." Example being Range Finder, nope don't work. Spending 4 hours getting burlap strips just to find out the Net Spawns are bugged (1 spawn per server that randomly jumps around every 15min...) Getting a vehicle running and not even 30sec later it's glitched. Spinning wheels...get a friend to reset it. Then a couple minutes in going to get fuel boom battle-eye DC...YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME...dead of course. So yeah it's all the pain of the MOD with none of the cool shit like helicopters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A long time ago I used to game on terrible laptops. My frame rates were low, my temperatures high. Then a mod to Arma II came out called DAYZ. I watched in envy all the true ascended on YouTube playing this glorious game. I purchased Arma II on Steam, but my integrated graphics laptop could not handle the glory. I cried console peasant tears that night. The frame rates where too low, the temperature too high. So I waited until tax season rolled around and I got a meager tax return stipend. I purchased a refurbished PC from ebay for the parts (the entire ASUS PC was less than the cost of just the i7 K spec CPU in it, I could not refuse.) So I used the lowly pre-true-ascension rig and slowly built upon it over the next few months. Now I stand high atop the mountain shoulder to shoulder next to my PCMR Brothers in the shining glory of the light. My frames are high, my temperatures and low. All hail Gaben for I am ascended.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up in a pretty poor family. My sister wanted nothing but a Sony CD player for christmas. My parents took turns every year with us who would get a big gift (in relative terms). And on Christmas day we opened our presents. My sister opened her CD player box and to all of our surprise it was not a box with one CD player in it. It was a case of them. 5 CD players. What a Christmas we each got one. It was awesome. With my grandparents money I got my first CD. The Fifth Element Film Soundtrack lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Zah slung his battle rifle up to to his shoulder and fired point blank at the marauding Krytolian towering over him. The massive hulk of the warrior slumped silently over the rubble. Zah cursed the invader. He wouldn't even give him the satisfaction of a scream of terror or pain. Zah snapped the magazine from his rifle and tapped it on the butt-stock. A hollow ring confirmed he was almost out. He would make these last rounds count. He slipped the magazine back into the battle rifle and heaved himself from his rubble cover. Krytolian warriors littered the battlefield their neon green blood illuminating the ground in an eerie phosphorescence. Zah staggered he tried to push the image of the many Zardonians soldiers he lost that day to the back of his mind. His friends, his command all dead. He had a job to do. Mega City four had already fallen earlier in the day. His last chance was to make it to what was left of city five's command center. He would have to cross 2600 feet of open enemy territory.

12 Hours Earlier. Planet Zardon Mega City 4 Command, 0800 hours.

Commander Zah stood behind eight inches of armored glass looking over the dimly lit landscape of his home world of Zardon. In the distance he could faintly see the warheads of the anti-ballistic missiles glowing red through the rolling morning fog. Today was the day. The defenses of planet Zardon would fall and the invasion of the Krytolians would begin. This was the last day Zah would stand in Missile Command. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the image annotated "The Kaiser's heir, inspecting the troops." That is the father of Obergruppenfhrer Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia. He was essentially third line of succession from Hitler (in a more ceremonial sense more than anything). The Obergruppenfhrer and Prince was held in the Flak-Kaserne Ludwigsburg across the street from my Grandmothers/Great-Grandmothers house by the Allies after the war awaiting Nuremberg trials. The US Military didn't feed the SS officers very well so my Grandmother used to throw apples over the fence. She never liked to see anyone go hungry prisoner or not. She also let the Prices' wife stand on the toilet in her bathroom and yell out of the window. The prisoners weren't allowed visitors but there wasn't much the US Army could do about wives yelling out of bathroom windows.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My great-grandfather's (conscribed Wehrmacht Heer soldiers) did not want to be involved in the war. They both had families that were depending on them and very young children. They were not S.S. and had no idea about the death camps. The death camps were a well kept secret. And if anyone reads anything about history and the Nuremberg trials will know that not even Hitler himself ever wrote a single order on paper regarding the camps. And when he did speak about them with those who knew it was always in euphemisms like "the final solution". They only ones who knew about the full picture knew from verbal orders or the ones actually perpetrating the crimes. 

A little background first. I am half German and half American. My mother's grandfathers both fought for the German military. Both were conscribed. My Great-grandfather Fischer died from Allied bombing of a German train station. He was a communications operator and had dropped his radio in the scramble out of the station. He went back for it when the bombs hit and was killed. My great-grandfather Beisswenger survived the war. He fought on the Russian front. He was shot and knocked unconscious (Russian side of a river I can't remember which one). When he woke he found that he was separated from his unit. He knew staying meant being killed so even though he couldn't swim decided to try to swim across. Needles to say he nearly drowned. A Russian soldier spotted him and took aim...the soldier took pity on my Great-grandfather. He lowered his rifle and instead threw him a tire. Considering how bloody and horrendous the Russian front was for this to happen was nothing short of a miracle. At the end of the war my great-grandfather Beisswenger had to walk from front home all the way to the outskirts of Ludwigsburg, Germany. He traveled with 2 fellow comrades sleeping hidden away during the day and traveling at night. They purposely avoided towns and cities due to rumors that the Russians were shooting unarmed German soldiers on the spot. Hunger eventually got to them and his two comrades decided to head into a town. He never heard from them again. He eventually made it home. His family did not know if he was alive or dead. My other Great-grandmother did not know the fate of my great-grandfather Fischer until the late 1960's when a comrade of his visited her and told her what happened. 

This is what the families knew. The area they lived in did not have a lot of Jewish people. A few Jewish neighbors did disappeared overnight. One was a doctor and everyone was quite upset about this since he was the only one in town. They were told they had moved away quite quickly due the animosity brewing towards Jews in other parts of Germany. They knew about the Ghettos being built, but all the propaganda they got basically said that these we just staging points to eventually move the Jews out of germany and into Poland and other places. They did not know about the death camps until American soldiers told them about them and eventually the Nuremberg trials. Across the street from my great-grandmother Fischers was a German military base that was conscribed by the US forces at the wars end. This base was converted into a German POW camp and eventually a prison for SS and the likes awaiting trial in Nuremberg. This included the S.S. Obergruppenfhrer Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia. They were pretty much starved by the US soldiers. My great-grandmother Fischer would throw the prisoners Apples over the fence. And would allow the prisoners wives to speak (more like yell) at their husbands from her bathroom window. 

My grandparents (who told me all of this) were both Hitler Youths at the start of the war. They were quite young during the war (16 at the end of the war). My grandmother still knew all the songs they taught her. They were both very Christian and never showed any hate towards anyone. A few years ago my grandfather for the first time went to a death camp. He went to Dachau with my step-father. My step-dad said my grandfather broke down in tears and could barely stand. My grandfather was overwhelmed by all the memories of what he had heard after the war and to see it in person just crushed him. He could not comprehend how his countrymen could do the things they did and call themselves humans.

<TEXT> Douglas Adams stood in complete shock in front of a red sofa. The sofa, to even most learned observer, appeared quite ordinary. It's armrest slightly worn an faded and the cushions seemed to sink lower than one would expect. It was indeed not the sofa itself that left Douglas in a shock. It was the fact that a mere moments before the red sofa had been his Irish Setter. Douglas leaned closer and cautiously called the dogs name "Biscuit?" Somewhat to his relief the red sofa did not reply. A pair of  pensioners strolled by nodding at Douglas and carefully sidestepping the red couch in the middle of the walking path. They took a wide path around Douglas who was still holding the leash attached to the couch. They stopped to further examine the situation. The elderly man then asked "Taking the old davenport for a stroll eh?". "Not...um exactly?" replied Douglas. The old couple turned and mumbled something about all the crazies and continued on their way. What Douglas did not know is just a few minutes before the pensioners came across a man wearing nothing but a bathrobe and towel laying in the fetal position in the middle of the path eating a packet of crisps complaining about a sodium deficiency. That man was none other than Arthur Dent. Who was now fully recovered, from whatever ordeal left him with far less sodium that he would like. Douglas first meet Arthur when the two collided on that same path. Douglas was cursing at the red couch with his back turned whilst Arthur was busy cursing the sky for no known reason running full speed. Luckily for both the red couch with less than the desired amount but still ample cushioning broke both their falls.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone recommended a book or story to me (it may have been a film but I doubt it) about 15 years ago. I can't seem to be able to find it. Basic plot: Alternate History WWII Nazi's won the war. The story takes place 100-200 years in the future. Nazi's have conqured the entire world and killed all non-white races and erased all mention of them from history. No one in general public knows anything about the true past or anything other than the Nazi empire. The story is the point of view of a college student in Tokyo (I believe this is the city, it is an Asian large city for sure) when he hears rumors of a strange race of people that are hidden in the mountains. Turns out they are Asian Survivors. Anyone know what this story/book w/e it is was called? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The old Sage sat in his rusted metal and ripped fabric strung together seat. His wrinkled right hand shifted like sand dunes, resting atop of what seemed like an even older cane. It looked to be forged from the roots of an ancient tree whose last leaves fell thousands of years ago. His patch work cloak seemed to cast his figure into the shadows. The lights from the torches set around him occasionally would dance bright enough to reveal his aged face from under the sunken hood. His eyes sparked like cold blue stars. The young children all jousted for front row seats on the ground. Their clothes all hand-me-downs repurposed from old rags sewn by mothers with more love than material. The children finally settled and waited eagerly for the Sage to speak. Long ago our ancestors crossed the Cold Black in their great sky ships. The Sage raised his root wood cane into the air and pointed toward the ceiling. They came as gods. Gods they did not remain for long. A great war tore them from the sky like falling stars. Stripped of their powers leaving them but stones to try and destroy each other. Our home is the bones of the old gods great sky ships. Like the ribs of the beast we slay, we live under the protection of the sky ships bones. The tools our ancestors once used to ascend to the power of gods now lay dormant in the sand. The sage outstretched his left hand like a bare tree branch quivering in an unperceivable breeze. Leaning on his cane he delicately snatched at a faint blue glowing pendant slung on one of the childrens necks. He cradled the pendant shaped like a tear in the palm of his open hand. The soft blue glow highlighting the deep wrinkles in his fingers. He then spoke looking away from pendant and into the distant dark. Like the necklaces all you children wear. The last remnant from the immortal ages of man. Its power fading like the suns at dusk. The sage pointed at a boy in the front row with his cane. That is why I am still around to see my great grandson of ten generations grow like a weed. Some of the children nearby playfully poked at the grandsons ribs tickling him. His relation to the great Sage was well known to them. And quite an honor for the young one. The little boy poked back at the others and as they all began to settle back down he asked his Grandfather How old are you exactly grandpa Sage? The sage dragged back his cane and drew his hand in thought to his white glowing beard. Well he paused. Using the time of the ancestors I will be 800 years old. The children all gasped. I am the last of the fallen stars. The power of the necklaces will not sustain me for much longer. The light glows dim, my life will near an end soon enough. The Sage could see this unrest the children. Fear not. I will live on in you. The lesson I have taught all these years. And even with only the faintest glow, the necklaces will keep you children safe. Now I must rest. The children looked forward to this nightly ritual of stories from the great past. The Sage would tell unbelievable stories of worlds with forests and water as far as the eye could see. Worlds free of the desert storms that sing in the night. The Sage, the last of the fallen stars, rested his eyes. Remembering the night so long ago when he was that young boy that fell into sand from the sky.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm from Maine just a town over from Bangor where Stephen King has his house. During summer vacation in high school a group of friends of mine and I decided to go to his house at 1am on a Saturday (in a semi stoned state) we had this great idea that if we went to his house that late and asked for a sandwich he would invite us in and make us one. Once we saw his wrought iron fence and gate (and to be honest quite ominous victorian style house) we got scared and resorted to one of my friend urinating in Stephen Kings driveway. Just a few months after school started the friend who urinated in his drive and I were heading to studyhall a bit early after lunch. As we cornered into the english wing there was Stephen King standing there with our English teacher (and the #2 most popular author from Maine) Mr. Sanford Phippen. My urinating friend turned to me and whispered "Oh God he's found us!".  </TEXT>
