<TEXT> As a developer, I know these types of comments. They're snide remarks about how a developer "probably doesn't understand [a difficult subject]" and that they only really know "trivial stuff." There's no way around it; that's an insult. These insults have been seen throughout the years: C++ devs looking down on web developers, full stack engineers dismissing app devs, systems engineers scoffing at the "simplicity" of consumer-level applications, etc. It's unnecessary, negative, and diminishes the work that a developer is actively working on.

Further, insults are more than crude death threats or things that a 16 year old says on XBL. I would *love* to believe the /r/emulation community recognizes that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ....it's obvious if you understood how insurance works. Those who take on unnecessary risks (tanning beds) end up paying more for insurance. That's because they're most likely to need it. Similarly, people with more money pay into the system to help those with no money. That way, poor people can have a better shot at life while riskier people and those more well off help cover the costs. Welcome to the real world. </TEXT>

Realistically speaking, people here are venting more than anything. I can guarantee none of the people saying that *truly want people to die*. It's cathartic to say "you guys got us in this mess and it's just deserts that you're going to be affected most by it."

 I just don't want to die, but people in here want me to.

The point is that while they can bump the internals of the 7 and sell it for the normal price tag, they can also get heavy users to spend more money on the "Pro" line. It wouldn't cannibalize sales because even if less people buy the iPhone 7s, that's because they'll be spending *more* money on the iPhone Pro. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  He was talking openly about meeting me in the Reswitched group, because he genuinely thought that it was absolutely fine.

No offense, but if it was implied that you would be hooking up when he sees you than that means he would be breaking the law. Not only that, but I personally have a hard time believing someone who's 22 doesn't know their age of consent. As someone in their 20's, I would feel very strange about flying to another country and meeting someone who is under the age of consent that has been drilled into my head since I was a child. It just sounds strange to hear that someone casually didn't know they'd be breaking the age of consent laws.

 So, please, tell me what is unhealthy in our relationship, since I lack one year for it to be legal in the UK ?

That, that right there. You might not like the law but that doesn't mean you should be able to break it because you are different. Extending your logic a bit, would you be fine with a 40 year old meeting a 14 year old in France? 

I'm not trying to tell you that you're wrong or that Dazzozo is some crazy pedophile, only that laws should be followed. Especially laws concerning older people having sex with minors.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  if the choice is between making more NES Classic or Switch, they are going to go with the Switch

What world are you living in where there's only one assembly line? Nintendo mass produces many things such as cartridges, disks, switch, joycons, 2ds, 3ds, 3dsxl, the New versions, amiibos, 3ds face plates, pokemon merchandise, etc. Saying that them halting production on one low yield product to bolster Switch manufacturing doesnt make sense. It would be like saying they're not gonna make 8bit Mario Amiibos anymore to boost the amount of joycons being created. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're asking a very general question so I'll try to give a concise answer. The answer is yes and no. Vulnerabilities are found in many parts of consoles (or computer systems in general) so it matters how well each of those parts are emulated. For example, theoretically, the Switch's Webkit exploit should work in a Switch emulator because the browser itself had the bug and the emulator should be able to emulate userland execution. On the other hand, there are other exploits such as the recent Broadcom exploit that can hack devices by hacking into the processor/OS *inside* the WiFi chip. This exploit most definitely wouldn't work in an Android emulator (like BlueStacks) because they don't fully emulate the Broadcom WiFi SoC hardware.

With all of that being said, look no further than the Wii U's vWii for proof that you can fully hack an emulated system. I believe you can even use Smash Stack on it to get HBL running :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The two most expensive real estate markets in the US are San Francisco and Manhattan, in that order. This might be a controversial statement but "you pay for culture" is the motto for American real estate. You can buy a huge house in rural Nebraska for $30,000 but you won't have much around you beyond farmland. Conversely, you can pay $2,500 a month in Manhattan to split a small place with a few people and have the freedom to party all night, go to one of a million restaurants, see Broadway plays, etc. Also, while the rent is high in metropolitan areas, wages are usually higher to compensate. So a salaried job that makes $50,000 in Nebraska might make $80,000 in New York or LA.

(These numbers are made up but adequately reflect the American job/housing markets) </TEXT>

<TEXT> When connecting to a secure server, the server gives the device its signature to validate that it's legitimately secure. A hacker can change the "nameConstraints" part of that certificate to crash Apple's certificate parser. The crash happens because the logic that decodes that part of the cert doesn't manage its memory properly. See, for a program to find a specific place in memory, it needs a pointer to a specific address. Pointers are dangerous because they need to be properly recycled when that memory is cleared. When iOS/maOS parses the "nameConstraints" field, it creates some empty space in memory and stores the pointer to it somewhere. When the error handling code starts, it clears the memory but doesn't erase the pointer. This leads to "unexpected behavior" aka the huge potential for a crash. With some finagling with the cert, the researches said they could use the pointer and memory to execute code.

All in all, this is a pretty bad bug, security-wise. I'm not saying it will lead to a jailbreak but the fact that any https web connection could serve a malformed cert is, well, not great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, you're not missing anything. It doesn't vindicate him at all. In fact, every news anchor including Bill O'Reilly said the revelation still doesn't prove his wiretap claim. Unfortunately, most Trump supporters don't care about facts or what experts say; they care more about feelings. To them, the news that "the government... collected data... on Trump..." is enough.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would agree if this were 2007 but the Republican party no longer represents standard "conservative platforms." 

Instead of focusing on fiscal responsibility, small government, and "wholesome values," the party has instead focused on racist policies, tax cuts for billionaires, cutting welfare/aid programs, big government on social issues, spending billions on a stupid wall, questioning what truly "constitutes rape," obstructionism, anti-American privacy, surveillance, pro-Russia, anti-education, etc.

Sure, Democrats also push some of those things (surveillance, especially) but my point stands. Going forward, the GOP needs to actually start converting Democrats and it'll be hard to win over a generation that has largely grown up with them as cartoon villains. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're getting at the answer; the GOP no longer needs to please any demographics. Young people overwhelmingly dislike them so the GOP knows that courting them will lead nowhere. The elderly love them but they're dying off every day. In five years, their voting bloc will literally have died off so why should they care what the elderly thinks anymore? It's obvious their party won't be around in 10 years so they're cashing in as much as possible right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  a webkit exploit doesnt really mean much

Why do I keep seeing people parroting this nonsense? Hacking a system requires a chain of  exploits and this is the first link. With this exploit, hackers now have the ability to read and write memory and make syscalls. Thats huge. I could be mistaken, but from here, we need more exploits to be able to write to non-modifiable memory pages and full code execution to successfully get homebrew up and running. Fortunately, the Switch seems to be running an OS very similar to the 3DS which means hackers already have an idea on how it's structured.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem to have a fundamental lack of understanding of how software development works. 

Let's say 1-2 Switch took 6 months to make. That's pretty quick in regards to a start-to-finish polished game with translations and voice acting but I digress. Let's say they pay their software engineers ~$100,000 a year. So, to reach your number, they would only have had two engineers conceptualizing, designing, programming, testing, localizing, marketing, acting, filming, directing, pressing, and finally shipping. In actuality, they definitely had a team of engineers, a team of designers/creative types for art direction, voice actors, video actors, etc. 

Software products cost $$$ to make. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're making *very* wild assumptions. 

The wikileaks article said that the arsenal has been "recently compromised" by security contractors and former government hackers. If we view that assertion in a vacuum, that hardly implies that nefarious hands have the tools. Thinking critically, though, these tools were probably stolen. There's absolutely no reason to believe that the CIA's former employees stole all of the agency's malware and documentation and then forwarded it to an obviously US-hostile entity. Further, your assertion that the CIA hacked and released Podesta's emails is ridiculous. The CIA hacked Podesta, released his emails, got Trump elected, and is now waging war with him? That makes absolutely no sense. You could argue that an ex-CIA employee did it with these tools but that's a claim based on a site that pushed anti-America propaganda and has heavy ties to Russia. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was written three weeks ago; so much has changed since then. Since the women's march, there have been *tons* of protests across the country. There have been people overrunning town halls to make sure their representative knows their feelings. Congress has been getting hundreds of thousands of phone calls (at least*). The article maintains a tone of "yes, marching feels nice, but people are gonna have to do more than just feel" and it seems like people have.


All of this has brought out a lot of change from the Trump administration. The LGBTQ executive order hasn't arrived (yet) thanks to a *huge* public outcry. The House Republican plan to gut the Congressional Ethics Office was cancelled. The bill introduced to sell off 3.3 million acres of national park land was stopped due to protests. The immigration EO appeal was denied and "public opinion" was mentioned in the court opinion. 


From the article:
 If the anti-Trump forces are to have a chance, they have to offer a better nationalism, with diversity cohering around a central mission...

I would argue that identity politics *is* that "better nationalism." The author's perspective on identity politics seems to be that it's defined as minorities screaming over each other. From the outside in, sure, it could appear that way. For those who are actually interested in identity politics, it's different. Every minority group is fleshing out their own identity and expressing their experiences as a means to connect with other groups. In turn, they learn about others' identities and experiences. You see, identity politics isn't about dividing us; it's about bringing us together. Think of a society where other groups aren't defined by caricatures on TV or stereotypes but rather their experiences and opinions. That's the world many of us are living in today thanks to identity politics.

Finally, I'd argue that identity politics is one of the most effective platforms for change because it's inclusive. When you have white people saying they'll sign up for a "Muslim registry" because they feel for Muslims, that's a huge win. When you have white people marching against police brutality, that's a huge win. When you have straight people calling their representatives to protect LGBTQ rights, that's another huge win. Going forward, identity politics is going to be extremely important in bridging the gap between cultures. 

(With that being said, there are a lot of people who go overboard with it. Though, that could be said about anything political, imo)

*I base this off of http://5calls.org. They say they've helped make 477,000 calls and that's just one site. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have like 30 min to an hour I'd suggest reading the whole opinion. The whole *29 page* document was savage. The court basically said "The administration has said we can't review their decisions. That's wrong for these 12 reasons. The government verbally said they'd refine a part of the Order. The court finds no reason to believe that will happen and it's suspicious that they haven't already altered the Order." and much more.

Really worth your time, imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You must be really young

Really? Must we always resort to shit like this? I'm 25. 

 Selling out is selling yourself out when you choose to purchase a brand strictly for the ego and recognition that comes with it. 

I'm sorry, but what? There are different ways to "sell out" but I'm not quite sure I understand yours. Are you saying "selling out" is when someone buys a hypebeast brand? That has nothing to do with the Supreme brand "selling out." The term (when used towards public figures/entities) usually means "selling yourself to the man." When I think of the term, I think of when people say independent artists "sell out" and are signed by Interscope. 

 Luxury fashion will never be dead as long as people are willing to pay.

Well, obviously. I wasn't saying the brands would fade away and no one would buy them anymore. Where did I imply that people would stop buying luxury goods? I literally have no idea how you read my posts and thought I implied that. 

 Letters do not mean luxury. Luxury is the quality and materials and craftsmanship.

I agree in regards to Supreme. I don't own any Supreme pieces because (imho) they lack imagination, individuality, and style. With that being said, do you even know what Louis Vuitton is beyond their 15 year old line of purses? How dare you say Nicolas Ghesquiere is "all name and very little quality."

<TEXT> I never said fashion is dead, that would be ridiculous. I said luxury fashion is dead because the majority of high end brands are owned by the same company and thus can prop up prices and influence trends.

 If you think that's selling out, then maybe wearing a garment strictly for letters written on it is selling out.

If selling your company to *the* fashion conglomerate doesn't constitute "selling out" then what does?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  As with any OS, as more bugs are patched, it gets more secure. 

This is true but not really for the reason you attributed. (You're not wrong, it's just more complicated than that). 

Patching an exploit doesn't really mean there is a dwindling supply of vulnerabilities. Software is constantly changing and every time Apple adds code to their OS then there's a new opportunity. The real reason the OS is getting more secure is that after a literal decade of learning about the attacks of each jailbreak, Apple probably has a much, much higher standard for code safety. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something I've noticed growing up is how much power we have simply through clothing. At the end of the day, it's just fabric and thread. When we put it on it's just as easy to take off. As a man, wearing a dress, skirt, choker, drag, crop tops, etc. can actually cause other people to act in such hateful ways that it's unbelievable. To me, that means you have a certain power over the people who don't understand that cotton is cotton.

<TEXT> 1. It was only an hour long protest.
2. The NYC taxi industry is predominantly Arab so this was a move to show solidarity with Middle Easterners.
3. Protests are meant to disrupt normal life. If they didn't then we'd hardly even know about them. This was a low-risk move for them (losing fares to/from JFK for an hour) that also got the message out. I mean, here we are talking about it two days later.

Yeah, it probably inconvenienced some people for an hour but I'd argue that temporarily forcing people to take an Uber/Lyft/Train to the airport to loudly protest an unconstitutional and discriminatory act is worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I said to another commenter:

Honestly, they took it back because I taught him what IP67 meant. He initially went to the back to talk to his supervisor about covering it and came back saying "It looks like we will cover it for you under AppleCare but you'll still have to pay $99. See, the ads say 'AppleCare doesn't cover water damage' and 'iPhone is not water proof' so it's your fault." Calmly, I asked if the guy knew what water resistant meant and he said "It means water can get on it without damaging the device." I replied "IP67 rating actually means you can submerge the phone in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes without breaking. Can we agree that the video I showed you wasn't over one meter of water?" "Well, sure." "And can we agree that I probably didn't leave it in the glass for over 30 minutes?" "Probably." "So then can we agree that there was probably a defect in the phone that would have shown up sooner or later because the phone apparently isn't 'water resistant?'" He agreed and then went to the back to talk to the manager and came back to the front ten minutes later and said "Well, it looks like we're going to cover it for you because something must've been wrong with the device."

Sure, maybe they covered it to see what's wrong with it but I literally had to break down what IP67 was to get them to cover it. You make it sound like the Apple Store employee initially said "Wow, that's not right! We'll go grab you a new one immediately! Sorry about this!" Which couldn't be further from the truth.

Beyond that, he truly cares about seeing people grow and acheive their dreams.

<TEXT> Once again, I am not the one arguing that no one should wear dreads. 

With that being said, I think trying to reach all the way back to a culture that many of us know nothing about just because there's an example of a hairstyle that many of us know as Bob Marley's hair is a bit contrived. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe the reason people get mad at hair styles is because "when white people wear them, they're fashionable, whereas when POC have worn them, they've historically been fun of for it." Not saying I totally agree with the point but I see the perspective. 

An example I've seen is that when Kylie Jenner wore dreadlocks many people thought they were really cool. On the other hand, many black people are told to shave their dreads because it looks like "they smoke too much weed" or "they don't shower/bathe." This extends outside of high school and also into the job sphere where they're warned not to have hair from their culture if they want a job.

Once again, I understand the perspective but as things progress and these different cultures' symbols become accepted, I can't imagine the sentiment lasting. Theoretically, one day (soon) black children won't feel bad for wearing their culture's hair and I think that's when it would stop. </TEXT>

A similar observation you might be interested in is that celebrity deaths this year have been terrible but they will only get worse going forward. Many of our culture's icons are baby boomers so as that group dies off, so will our heroes. It's sad but it's healthier to view it from a logical perspective rather than "this is so sad, all of my childhood heroes are dying!!!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, I'll try and take a stab at this

One major pain point is that it has been around for so long that it has many vestigial UI's. Throughout the last five years or so Apple has played with a couple UI designs and seems to have settled on a Frankenstein's Monster UI that's not really seen anywhere else. There's a drop down menu/tab bar/web browser button bar on top. There's the tab bar on the left that delves deeper into each of the sections selected by the top dropdown menu. The music UI has been constantly shifting and has never felt right since the initial song list UI. Recently Added and albums share an Album UI (that used to have adaptive color which has since been removed). Artists and Genres feature UIs a-la the Mail client. Songs has the old songs list UI. Playlists have the own UI, as well. That's *just* the "Library" tab of the Music sub-menu.

Another issue is that Apple Music was just shoe-horned into an already bloated app. Search now makes you pick "Your Library" or "Apple Music." If you "add" a song from Apple Music, it puts it in your Library. If you cancel Apple Music, those songs are still in your Library but are unplayable. On top of that, iTunes Match is a *separate* $20/year fee so paying for Apple Music doesn't even let you listen to "Your Library" on your phone without syncing it. 

Oh yes, device syncing. iTunes houses all of the iDevice syncing stuff which would be better suited in a separate app. Why do I have to open up iTunes to back up my iPhone? Why do I need to open iTunes to put a document in the Pages app on my iPad? 

Honestly, there's a bunch more. "iTunes" for some reason selling movies, tv, ringtones, audiobooks, iTunes U, podcasts, and phone apps. The multiple rating systems per-track. How slow it runs on Windows computers. The twice-failed Ping/Connect "social network." Not offering over 256kb music (in this day and age!). Not offering 4k content. Etc, etc, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not really a feasible solution for a handful of reasons:

1. That limits development to places where you have the internet.
2. Apple would need an unbelievable amount of servers to make this work because developers can't wait for one to be free to compile the build.
3. The time it would take to upload large projects to be compiled and then download all of the compiled files once done would be a large waste of time.
4. Trade secret issues with having to send Apple your code.
5. The servers would have to be configurable for each developer because no two projects are alike. That means Apple would have to let devs pick which compiler, libraries, runtime, etc. are in each of their dedicated slice.

Those are just off the top of my head </TEXT>

<TEXT> As it stands, MacBook Pros aren't as fast as many devs would like them to be. Moving development over to ARM processors would make compiling take f o r e v e r. 

Beyond the obvious speed issues, I could not stress enough how *fucking stupid this move would be.* Sure, they can *try* to move iOS development to iOS. What about Android development? What about web development? What about open source/UNIX development? What about all of the developers who use boot camp to work on Windows projects?

At the moment, Apple has made HUGE inroads into the enterprise business because every developer uses their machines. Dropping development support means every developer would just go back to using a Windows machine and thus (presumably) boost other ecosystems while simultaneously drying up the iOS ecosystem.

There is absolutely no way that switching to iOS-based development would work out for them. </TEXT>

Instead of launching the dsiware hack which enables the 3DS downgrade you can now launch FBI. Since you don't have a CFW, though, you can't patch the sig checks to install pirated or homebrew cias. You can still install legit cias though because those basically lack a signature so the 3DS treats it like it was preinstalled on the device </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I do not take genetic responsibility for anything and it's racist in this context for you to try and make me.

Listen, no one is talking specifically about _you_ when they discuss "white people" in the context of society. You didn't write the laws. No one is asking you to take "responsibility for anything." Please learn to separate yourself from the discussion regarding how society treats minorities.

I'm sure you're a great guy. I'm sure you try hard to be a nice person and I'm sure you say hello to strangers and hold doors for them, too. Nobody is saying that _you_ are the one oppressing minorities nor that you have to apologize for it! Honestly, it's not about that!

In 2015, hate crimes towards Muslims [rose 67% year over year](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf). Similarly, the FBI [has reported](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/home/topic-pages/victims_final) that in 2015, "59.2 percent of the victims were targeted because of the offenders bias against race/ethnicity/ancestry." Of that percentage, "52.7 percent were motivated by anti-Black or African American bias."

No one is saying you did that. Nobody is asking you to apologize or take ownership of those terrible actions. Honestly, we just want these issues to be _acknowledged._ </TEXT>

It's shocking to me that there are people who adamantly believe that white people aren't given more of a leg up in America than blacks, hispanics, arabs, native americans, etc. I'm not saying that white people are good, bad, perfect, evil, better, worse, whatever. I'm just saying that society has historically been nicer to them than other races. For example, the sentences for cocaine (a drug historically done by white, middle-to-upper class people) are far more lenient than the sentences for crack (a drug historically done by black, lower class people) despite being nearly the same chemical compound. Heck, there was a _5 year mandatory minimum_ on simple _posession_ of crack cocaine. 

See: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act

For what it's worth, I'm a white male in his mid-20's whose father had a crack addiction for 10 years </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Rape culture" not only relates to the actual act but (unsurprisingly) the culture that allows it to occur so freely. Here are some random instances:

* "Of course she was raped, why was she alone?"
* "Did you see what she was wearing? She basically asked to be raped."
* Instagram banning content with female nipples but allowing male nipples and butts. (This preserves the "sanctity" of the female body).
* "Blurred Lines" a song about a "good girl" saying no but a man knowing what she really wants being the runaway song of the summer. 
* "A key that works everywhere is a master key, a lock unlocked by any key is a shitty lock."
* Any "coming of age" film surrounding a boy who is trying to "get lucky" by fucking a drunk girl

These instances and many, many more help create "rape culture;" a social enviornment where it's encouraged to sexually demean women. Yes, most people agree that rape is bad but many people also find nothing wrong with the above. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  just because I tell VMWare to allocate 4GB of RAM to my main Windows admin VM, doesn't mean that VM is actually just going to take 4GB of RAM and never give it up until it shuts down. Like anything, it's dynamic.

As an amateur emulator developer, I'm not sure how that's possible. If you were to run 3 separate VMs in parallel and allocate 4GB of RAM for each, then wouldn't those three "machines" need an addressable 4GB range of memory? I could see using the disk to cache some of the memory but that would really degrade performance, no? This is a genuine question :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, I'll break the situation down a little bit if you don't know. 

America and Saudi Arabia are political allies for largely 2 reasons. One is that SA is positioned in the Middle East and, frankly, America needs as many friends there as possible. The second (and most important) reason is oil, of course! SA is the largest contributor to OPEC and its de facto leader. We need to be nice to these people so we can get a great deal on oil to power our grid, cars, planes, etc. The US is the number one importer of oil in the entire world so keeping its price down is obviously very important to our economy's health. Recently, we have been working towards addressing this issue by fracking. The short term results have been generally positive for the US because the price of oil has dropped (which has had devastating repercussions elsewhere [see: Venezuela]). Long term, we hope to be able to solely rely on our oil in the next 20 years.


If we were to piss off SA (which we are due to "suing them for funding 9/11") then the cost of oil is going to skyrocket. That would translate into expensive gas on the way to work, increased bus fares, higher electricity bills, more expensive flights, etc. All of that would _greatly_ harm the economy because people couldn't afford to commute or travel as much. We really do need to move to more alternative energy sources...

This isn't a dystopia, really. It's just that macro politics are complicated and everything has a butterfly effect. </TEXT>

2. No one knows who the winner is because RPDR films all outcomes and then airs the real winner. That way there are no leaks about the winner. That means the girls learn who won at the same time we do.

<TEXT> Columbus actually has a pretty great gay scene. I used to live there a few years ago before moving to SF and the gag is that Columbus might have a better scene imo.

Columbus is actually a very, very gay-friendly city. It doesn't have the sheer amount of gay clubs SF has but that works in its favor. There's pretty much a designated bar (or two) for each part of gay culture. Want to dance through the night with college twinks to pop? Axis. Want to catch a drink and meet a lot of 20-40-somethings? Union. Want to go to a nice little gay dive bar to chill and potentially sing karaoke? Local Bar. Want to go see the bears and fetish-types? Exile. The reason this works so well is that the gay community is able to go wherever they feel they fit in without truly splintering. In SF there are multiple bars, clubs, cafes, etc. for each faction and that really splits up the whole community, imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For your purposes, I would learn C, Cbj-C and (most importantly) ARM assembly.

Please note that security research is much, much harder than just learning a language. Before understanding assembly, you have to know how a processor works (at a fundamental level, that is). Once you understand what registers, memory addresses, clock cycles, etc. are then you can learn assembly. This is important because assembly is basically the language that tells the processor specifically what it should do. Once you have assembly down, then start learning exploitation techniques. This covers buffer overflows, rop chains, and more. To understand how these work you need to know how computer hardware works (which is why you learned it earlier). Finally, you can begin to reverse the code use IDA Pro (if you like) and are able to deduce how the logic flows. While going through the logic, you should eventually be able to find holes in the logic which might lead to exploits.  </TEXT>

Writing Camera2 support back when the only supported phones were the N5, N6, GS6, and LG G4 was a nightmare. IIRC, the N5 didn't support all of the advanced controls, the N6 dropped support for exposure compensation in a .0.1 update, and the GS6's hardware basically reported lies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, a lot of these responses are either unhelpful or intentionally lacking a real explanation.

The bootrom contains the instructions that prepare the hardware to load the operating system when the device first turns on. These instructions are in a **R**ead-**O**nly **M**emory which means they can't be altered after they were set in the factory. There are many reasons for this but it's mostly for security reasons. If one were to find an exploit in the bootrom, they would be able to have control of the device _before_ iOS even boots. Not only does that mean that it's unfixable but that also means one could patch iOS as it boots to remove a lot of security checks. Even if Apple updates the OS to include more security we could disable it because the exploit runs _before iOS even starts._ 

Hopefully that helps :) </TEXT>

1. An emulator written in BASIC will be *extremely* slow.
2. There's no way the emulator can open the iso, load the boot screen, and play the video that quickly.
3. A gamecube emulator written in BASIC would have to be written from scratch. While feasible, it makes little to no sense to write one from the ground up in such a limited environment.

There are many more reasons this is fake but those three at least should be enough to disprove this video. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, it is. In regards to older/less advanced systems, video decoding tends to be more of a CPU-bound task. The GPU and the CPU both differ in how they handle tasks. The CPU (neglecting multi-core architectures for simplicity) only processes one piece of information at a time. That means if it has to do a math equation then it can only do one equation per cycle. GPUs, on the other hand, are kind of like a collection of a lot of dumbed-down CPUs all running at once. These cores are really fast but there's a catch; they're specialized and they can only do *one thing at a time.* That means if you need to grayscale an image, a CPU would go through every pixel, convert its value to the proper grayscale value, and then move on until it's done. That's pretty slow. GPUs, on the other hand, can segment the image into 100 different sections and find the grayscale value of each section in parallel. That makes the (repeatable) process _much faster._ On top of that, the hardware of each core is very specialized for specific calculations. This math could center around things like drawing polygons, generating fog, light effects, etc. Having the dedicated hardware to generate this stuff is both power-efficient and optimized for speed. This is a gross over-simplification on how everything works but it should illustrate how the hardware works at the simplest level.

So let's switch gears and talk about how this applies to the 3DS. The [GPU in the 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICA200) is specialized to do a lot of 3D-centric computations. Also, it's (sadly) single core. That means that anytime the 3DS needs to render something, it passes the data to the GPU which works like a separate 3D-optimized core. That allows the CPU to continue chugging along doing what it does best while the GPU chugs along doing what it does best.

Many modern GPUs have video decoding built-in to their instruction set but the GPU the 3DS uses was announced in 2005. According to the [Wikipedia article on h.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC), the initial standard wasn't agreed upon until late 2004. There's no way the GPU that was being worked on in 2004 has built-in hardware to decode h.264. While it was _technocally_ announced after h.264, the hardware to optimize encoding/decoding didn't show up for a few years.

And that's why the 3DS can support advanced 3D graphics but not modern video formats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> See, playing video is actually a _very_ processor intensive task. It's not as simple as "show each frame and play a song," which some might think. To get the file size down as much as possible, the source frames and audio are heavily compressed. For many formats that means there are "reference frames" and each subsequent "frame" is the difference between the current frame and the reference frame. To stitch this all back together on the fly requires a lot of arithmetic that pushes the hardware. Now, imagine all of that on top of playing and syncing an audio stream at the same time. Fortunately, most computer/mobile processors nowadays have specific hardware devoted to decoding videos like h.264. This increases both the power efficiency and speed of encoding/decoding videos.

I could be wrong but I've never read about h.264 hardware in the 3DS.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both, honestly. Creating an emulator involves knowing many obscure concepts such as binary reverse engineering, how a computer's motherboard functions, how to properly set up a large project, many code optimizations, a strong familiarity with assembly, graphics experience in regards to video out, audio programming experience, an understanding of how dsps work, and much more. 

Writing an emulator involves much more than what the average CS degree covers regarding hardware systems. With that being said, it also involves much more in terms of programming than what most EE degrees cover.

(Then again, I might be biased because all the EE/ECE students I've ever met think they know how to program anything because they've learned Matlab and took two semesters in C heh) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great question!

There are many ways to write an emulator but they mostly involve implementing a software-based CPU, RAM, DSP, GPU, etc. at varying levels. A normal emulator tends to take short cuts when implementing each of these because it's much, much easier and takes less time. A cycle-accurate emulator aims to implement each of those subsystems perfectly with regards to keeping each of them perfectly in sync.

An example would be how a CPU reads/writes from memory. Let's look at a pretty easy system:

1. The CPU uses the Program Counter (the point in memory that the CPU is currently executing) to fetch a command.
2.  Upon reading that command, it executes the command. We'll say "Load the contents of memory address 0x3 into memory address 0x1." Thus, the CPU stores what's in memory at 0x3 into memory at 0x1.
3. The PC is incremented and thus repeat part 1.

So, a normal emulator would do this:

1. Have the CPU class read from an array of integers (the memory subsystem) at the index of the Program Counter.
2. The CPU class analyzes what the command is.
3. Once figuring out the command, the CPU executes the function by setting the integer at index 0x1 to the integer at index 0x3.
4. The CPU class increments the Program Counter, loop.

This is great but it doesn't take into account many real-world hardware issues like memory latency, how fast it takes to read from memory as compared to writing, bus speed, etc.

A cycle-accurate emulator would function similarly to how the actual hardware works:

1. Fetching the command takes 1 cycle so begin 1 cycle to read the command from memory.
2. Executing this command is supposed to take 2 cycles. Begin the second cycle.
3. First, read the contents of memory address 0x3 into a register. (A temporary cache in the CPU thats really fast). This takes a cycle.
4. Next, start the third cycle. Write the register's contents to memory address 0x1.
5. Increment the PC, loop. 

The actual hardware is timed so each moving part has a proper state for each cycle. Emulating each of these states allows the intricacies of the hardware to be nearly "cycle-accurate." It takes a lot of time and power to execute things this way, though. 

Hopefully this helped explain it a bit. It's hard to convey such advanced concepts to an unknown audience :/ Also, this wasn't the _best_ example but it allowed me to quickly describe the CPU fetch/execute cycles without going into too much detail on how the hardware works. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yikes, some people seem to be confused by this so I'll try to break it down a bit.

This appears to be a wireless memory debugger for the 3DS. To use it, you need to have NTR booted on your console. From your computer, you're able to write or download python scripts that can connect to your 3DS and read/write memory values. 

This enables developers to debug memory values more easily, change a value in memory without recompiling (a feature most "official" IDEs support), and potentially search the memory of a game for exploit purposes.

As for the average user, this could enable a script sharing site for on-the-fly tweaks to the system. One day, there could be a gallery of tweaks for things such as "Make Ness always cause 9999 damage," "Change the home menu text to such-and-such," or potentially more CFW-based tweaks such as region free.

The only downside, imo, is that it has to be run from a computer :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I is for intersex and A is Asexual/Aromantic.

In simplest terms, intersex is when one's genitals aren't specifically male or female. This is probably what most think of when they think "hermaphrodite." Asexual/aromantic are people who either exhibit no sex drive or romance. I know it sounds *extremely* cliche at this point but asexuality is just a spectrum, not an orientation. So a guy could watch a lot of straight porn and jerk off but not necessarily care for sex in real life. Similarly, a woman could be attracted to another woman but not feel any particular romance for her.

<TEXT> Ok. Wow.

Let's try to work through this. 

There's a difference between someone working with IS to commit an atrocity and someone doing it in the name of IS. One implies a terrorist organization has cells throughout the world and is actively using them to coordinate attacks. The other implies there are individual terrorists around the world who want to cause harm in the name of IS. I hope that we can agree that one situation is much worse than the other.

With that noted, the Orlando shooter called 911 dispatchers saying he was about to murder in the name of IS. In the same phone call, he also claimed solidarity with al-Nusra. Al-Nusra is another organization that is actually at odds with IS. From this, we can *most likely* gleam that he wasn't directly connected to either orgs but was instead "killing in the name of."

There's *far more* at play here than just "rah rah religion!" As it stands, the Orlando massacre is far more an lgbt-related hate crime than it is an Islamic terrorist group attacking the West. </TEXT>

3. More people go out at night.
4. People stay out later because of DST.

These are just some of the reasons that crime/homicide spike during the summer. There are more hate crime-related reasons, too, like June being Pride month. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the more tech savvy people do not llike to pay twice as much for the same hardware, don't like to pay 250$ for 32 gigs of storage and most importantly they do not like to overpay just to be put in a cage.

That's a very gross simplification. Beyond the fact that Mac OS is now [the platform of choice for devs](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016), this whole argument that "tech savvy people don't buy/use iOS devices" is played out. I can't believe I have to point this out but there are over [1.4 MILLION apps in the App Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_\(iOS\)#Number_of_iOS_applications). 

Anecdotally, I'm an Android engineer in the Bay Area and it's much harder to find an Android developer than an iOS dev. Not only that, but it's extremely hard to find an Android developer who truly knows what they're doing with the platform. </TEXT>

The first point has nothing to do with emulation and your second point is actually not really true. The iPhone's SoC has [mostly](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9686/the-apple-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review/6) [been](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8554/the-iphone-6-review/5) [rated](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8554/the-iphone-6-review/6) [best](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7335/the-iphone-5s-review/7) [in class](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7335/the-iphone-5s-review/5).

How can the line be corny if it directly fed into one of the most political moments of the album? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nahh, it's usually used for a "non-blocking call," at least on mobile/PCs. An example is how your mail client has to parse through all of your mailbox the second you open it. Instead of doing this on the main/UI thread, the developer uses a second thread to load the database. Once it's ready, the UI thread merely updates the window with content. That way you can scroll/use the application without it locking up for awhile. It's also used to half work at times. As in, if two threads can be used to process two halves of an image at a time, then why not? Though, parallelized computations has largely gone out of fashion due to GPU computation frameworks like CUDA and OpenCL.

Also, just an fyi, RAM has nothing to do with this :) RAM only dictates how _much_ data can be processed at once. With less RAM you can't store as much info in memory. That translates to slow downs because the CPU has to spend more time pulling data from disk, putting it in memory, working on the data, pulling more data from disk, etc. etc. That's also why less RAM leads to slow OS'. A running application's state has to be held somewhere and if there's not enough room in memory, it gets stored on disk. So returning to that app means the CPU has to free up memory and move that state from disk back into memory. That's most of the speed increase you'll see. There are other things like how fast the memory can be read but that's mostly imperceivable, imo.

....sorry if that was unwarranted haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, don't let everyone else scare you. Multithreading in _most_ cases really isn't that bad. In mobile development you only need to use it for non-user-facing tasks like loading an image or making a network call. That's pretty simple and very rarely screws things up. Beyond apps and simple client-side applications, it can get hairy. Server-side multithreading is made especially difficult due to the severity of fucking up a web service. Fortunately, though, there are many languages and libraries to help mitigate these issues. It's still really annoying, but it's not the disaster people make it out to be.

The hard part about multithreading is that it takes patience and time to learn how to do it right. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is not a problem we need solved.

I respectfully disagree. 

By framing it as removing dejected people from public transportation, then yes, it sounds bad. Framed another way, BART was not meant for half of the capacity it's experiencing and we need to solve its space issue. People who use the train as a means to sprawl out and sleep are exacerbating these issues. We need to actively work on these problems to see solutions. 

Are penalties the solution we need? No. In my opinion, BART's current testing of cars with less seats is the way to go. Note, though, that this would inadvertently lead to less people sleeping in seats.

All I'm saying is that something has to be done to help our infrastructure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> poorly.

From the GitHub page I just found:

 * Tap Wheel: Tap the wheel as a directional trackpad to move the mouse pointer (8 directions allowed)
* (Pressed) Select button: Mouse Left Click
* (Pressed) Rewind: Mouse Right Click
* (Pressed) Forward: Mouse Right Click
* (Pressed) Menu: In-Game Menu
* (Pressed) Play/Pause: number 6 (to enter the codes and skip the protections, i.e. Monkey Island 2)
* Hold: Esc/Skip 

 How to right click on objects:

 1) Just press Forward or Rewind on the hotspot. Be fast as the tapping will move the pointer at the same time.

or (better)

 2) Press the Select Button over the object (that equals to the Left Button) and THEN add the Forward or Rewind button. The controls have been designed to stop the Tap Wheel moving the pointer when the Select Button is pressed, so while you prepare to press Forward or Rewind, the pointer will stay in place. Use this tecniques to "anchor" the pointer to an hot spot. Compatibility

<TEXT> SF guy who has recently lived in Tokyo for a month checking in. Tokyo is just as expensive as a Western big city (New York, London, SF, etc) if not a little more. If you really, really plan ahead you can find decently-located hotels for ~$120 a night but I imagine that's shot during the Olympics. Food is cheaper there but only marginally. Though, you can skate by by spending ~$8 per meal at a local 7/11 or Circle K. Taxis are unbelievably expensive. The train system, while expansive and timely, are also expensive.

IMO, I wouldn't call Tokyo "reasonably priced" in regards to anything. That's just my opinion, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the phantom app would be theoretically be possible but would involve a lot of work. It would mean patching the Snapchat binary with new functionality, which sounds hard. Tethering is interesting. There are multiple ways to initiate tethering so that's where it gets complicated. 

One is to enable the built-in OS-level tethering/hotspot. That's how TetherMe works. That's not gonna work.

Another way is with MyWi. I believe this is an app but it used its own bluetooth/wifi stack or something like that. This most likely won't work.

Finally, there's an app approach that can create a local server and forward the internet through a port. This is how pdanet and apps that snuck tethering in to the App Store works. This is the type of app that will work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 0day is the security industry term for a vulnerability that's previously unknown. Basically, if a virus were released with a brand new entry point, then that is the first day (0day) that the exploit is known to the world. They're pretty hard to come by (relatively speaking) and are worth a lot of money either thru a company's legitimate bug finding program or on the black market. The reason being that it's guaranteed to work on every system and that it will go unnoticed for a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 3DS has support for ARM7, ARM9, and ARM11, I believe. When you boot a GBA VC, DSiWare title, or a DS cartridge, the 3DS actually reboots itself. For the GBA titles, it boots into AGB_FIRM which uses ARM7 just like the GBA and is able to run the game on-metal. For DS games, the device boots into TWL_FIRM and is similarly able to run the games on-metal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What exactly are you trying to do? To boot rxTools with sig-patched SysNAND, boot it in rxMode. To do that, select rxTools from HBL and hold the L (or R, I can't remember) bumper while launching. You should be treated with a menu with a bunch of options. In fact, whatever you might be trying might be accessible there!

Also, make sure you have the firmware files in the rxTools folder.
 If you are using an Old 3DS or 2DS, ensure you have Python 2.7 installed on your PC and run /Tools/o3ds_cdn_firm.py. This should download 3 files into a folder named /firm. Copy this entire folder and place it into SD:/rxTools/

<TEXT> Yes you can though it seems a little redundant. To launch the HBL via, you need to run sig patched SysNAND. To get to that state, you need to have an exploit that can boot pasta, mini pasta, rxmode, gateway mode, etc. At that point, you might as well set up the exploit to load CtrBootManager and have it point to one of the above AND HomeBrew Channel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks to A9LH, what you've learned so far is, well, outdated. The reason people are switching to SysNAND is because:

1. A lost less hassle
2. Faster
3. Much easier GBA/DSiWare installs
4. Don't have to deal with "CFW-stuff" unless you have a probelm
5. It's all fixable anyway!

SysNAND with a recovery partition is the future. Sure, it's rough around the edges and barebones atm, but we need people to be early adopters :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> They've done multiple OS X/iOS betas at once, so this is pretty normal tbh. The reason they have multiple builds is that 9.2.1 will be released well before 9.3 solely to fix bugs. iOS 9.3 will include the final bug fixes from 9.2.1 but will take much longer to test all of the new features. Plus, if there a new bugs when 9.2.1 is released, they can be fixed with 9.3.

This is a pretty common thing in software engineering, imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it's totally possible. When it comes down to it, the Wii U Home Menu is just another Wii U executable. That means if we can get the emulator to properly emulate Wii U executables then it should work. There may be some tricky things that need to happen before running the Home Menu but it couldn't be too difficult. This would be something like loading it into memory at a specific address, figuring out the executable's structure (if it differs from games), and more. Also, I could forseee some potential issues when launching games from the menu but that's all part of making a proper hardware emulator. 

Note: I have no idea how cemu is structured (no one does) but I have experience writing/porting emulators. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It would be like creating a tweak that flashes the screen white when taking a FFC photo. Sure, it looks like Apple's new Retina Flash feature, but it's really just a cheap imitation. 

Apple's Retina Flash analyzes the camera input, decides what two colors to flash to correct the lighting, determines the timing of those flashes based on a multitude of real-time variables, and then fires it.

The hypothetical tweak would flash a white screen when the user clicks the button.

I hope that explains my thought process a little more.  </TEXT>

Without supporting the actual file format, this is just some lipstick on a pig. If users can't share the LPs to iOS 9 users and have it work the same then this isn't Live Photos. That would be similar-looking functionality but that wouldn't really make it useful, IMO.

<TEXT> Ok, wow.

* OP (heyyoudvd) said "that single core score is higher than that of an Intel Core i7 920 processor," NOT a Haswell/Haswell-E-based chip. 

* For those who don't know (I'm sure ShinyTile does), the 920 came out in _2008_. 

* Thus, all OP said was the iPhone 6s scored better than a 7 year old desktop proc.

* Heck, you even acknowledge that the scored roughly the same as a 2013 mid-tier mobile proc. Yes, they're not the same and benchmarks aren't cross-platform, but still.

* Why tf would you pull out k-line processor benchmarks? Those are the highest-end processors that are a niche product for (presumably) gamers/creative types/hobbiests. All OP said was it could beat a 7 year old i7 and your response is to say no because it's not as good as today's high end desktop processor.

The A9 looks like a fantastic mobile processor and there's no reason to think an embedded CPU can't be better than a 7 year old PC. It's also important to remember that Intel has stalled out on performance increases in the last few years in exchange for power improvements. Just as Intel has been working to make x86 chips ARM-efficient, ARM has been gunning for x86-performance. Neither are there yet but you guys should probably stop writing off embedded processors soon.

Fortunately, my friend is moving and his apartment sounds great for you! It's in Glen Park, costs $900, includes a female roommate, and they're looking for a roommate ASAP! :)

I know it doesn't mean much but I can vouch that they're both sane, normal people and aren't scamming you heh.

Good luck!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh, wrong.  They are *not* doing "flat."  Repeat after me: "iOS 7 is _not_ flat."

In fact, the whole ideology of iOS 7 is depth, AKA the opposite of flat.  They went with a minimal design (note: there's a difference) but include different  layers to show the user where they are in a faux-3D space.  This is why the folder animation zooms, the highest possible panels are glass, and the wallpaper follows parallax movement.  All of these come together to give the user context into where they are in the OS and what their actions do in that context. </TEXT>

I don't understand this viewpoint.  There are so many NFC-based Android phones in America but it's still yet to "take off."  After a certain point, you can't just blame that on Apple for not using a hardware feature that has obviously been unpopular with consumers and businesses and start asking other companies like Samsung or HTC to create the solutions you mentioned.

"Apple should start making Segways!"

"Why?  No one bought those nor do they think they're useful..."

If I were to release it, it would most likely be closed source and for $.99.  Though if I clean the source up a lot, I could foresee myself releasing the source and using the Play Store app as a donation.  Sadly, ad revenue wouldn't work with this UI. :(

You don't have to line the photo up to the lines; they're [all random](http://imgur.com/a/OCz8U).  In fact, there's even a random number of band distortions per image!  I hope you don't mind me using your (fantastic) photo here!   </TEXT>

Here are a few more images of the GB Camera effect on some of my (admittedly stunning) friends:

<TEXT> I'm being 100% honest when I say that I lost the code last night to this and a cool VHS effect I was working on.  My computer randomly shut off (thanks old Apple battery...) and Eclipse (yes, this was written in Java, sosueme) decided to zero out the source code :(

[Here's an example](http://25.media.tumblr.com/08e56c8fc039317a3f0b2502b5b38248/tumblr_mjrcrpr4np1s89vx9o1_500.jpg) of what I had going with the VHS effect.  This is my take on the bottom band artifact that happens on worn down tapes but it was applied to the whole photo.  I like the look of it; it reminds me of the original Tron movie! </TEXT>

Arms/Back Days:

1.  Bench Press
2.  Curls with the EZ-Curl bar
3.  Dips
4.  Low Row
5.  Behind the head barbell shrug... thing (my roommate showed it to me)
6.  Concentrated curls

Legs/Abs Day:

1. 125 sit ups
2. Plank-typed exercises
3. Glute kickback
4. Leg Press
5. Leg Extensions
6. Calfs on the leg press machine

Any suggestions are more than welcome and would be taken to heart! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Reddit usually hates it when women aren't 100% verbally clear about their intentions with no reliance on hint, body language, or normal social protocol, but suddenly it's take the compliment, bitch?

This.  I'm so tired of redditors (and more abstractly, guys) say, "It was obvious we were flirting but she never told me she had a boyfriend; what a bitch!" and then see things like this.  What OP said was a bit off hand, but if a guy came up to a girl and said "I like your shirt, gorgeous," then it's obvious that he's hitting on her.  She would be doing the right thing by telling him that she's seeing someone because he wouldn't feel strung along. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  We do however celebrate the dead on Nov. 1st (All Saints), but it's a somber Catholic festivity

As someone who's taken a lot of Spanish and Italian classes, can I point out that, while yes, both holidays share the same roots and deal with the dead, they're really not similar?  All Saints or Dia De Los Muertos (Mexico) is actually about remembrance and celebration whereas Halloween is more of a commercial holiday.  There's literally 0 remembrance going on; it's a day to buy costumes, buy candy, buy decorations, etc.  

Don't get me wrong, it's my favorite holiday!  I've just always been fascinated by All Saints and am actually saddened something of that nature isn't celebrated here. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm blaming both sides for this.

What?  God, not everything has two sides.  Ryan used a charity in a swingstate as a photo op.  He was called out on it and, in his defense, conservative supporters have pulled donations.  That's what happened.  There's nothing about Democrats politicizing this (which they should have; this shows how much of a scumbag he is).  This is all his fault, and honestly, he should offer to donate to them due to the fact that his presence harmed the charity and the city. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way HD gifs work is they flatten the scenes so they only encode what's different in each scene.  So, if a man was waving but everything else was still, it would only be like 1 frame and 4 "frames" that only encode the hand moving.  This scene is unable to have an HD gif because the camera shifts, every person is moving, and it's unbelievably long.  Well, you could have one, but it would literally be an uncompressed file containing 120 images.  It would be a pain to load. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from, but I think you're misplacing blame. Universities don't force people to do anything; if a student doesn't like their major, they should switch it. Also, you shouldn't ask someone about classes they've taken or school. This is a mistake that many students make; they list class projects or courses on their resume without realizing that every CS student in the world has to take some form of that class to graduate. These sound like ill-prepared students or graduates and it's no wonder you're constantly finding duds.  Also, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, I swear, but try looking for personal projects, actual work experience, or contributors to open source projects. Those all imply passion and drive when it comes to CS. Anyone can get a degree, but it takes a certain type of student to actually work outside of class , none-the-less for free. Just my two cents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> UNINFORMED OPINION ALERT!

I believe swimming works most of the muscles in your body in some even fashion.  Also, there's much to be said about calisthenics versus weights.  Swimming is probably extremely useful here because it strengthens the core more naturally.  Though, I'm sure weightlifting is good as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a substantial difference, though.  While there are different feature sets, All iPhones/iPod Touches (beyond the newest generation) can be one section, all iPads can be another, and then there's the new generation of devices.  Since those devices are "retina" their resources just need to be a quarter of the size for their non-retina counter parts and the app should work with very little redesign.  That's hardly  the same as dealing with MDPI, XHDPI, HDPI, LDPI, different processors ranging from 600 Mhz to 2 Ghz QuadCore, 128 MB RAM to 2 GB RAM, and more.  

Also, the cameras, cell network, and GPS might seem like a lot, but it really isn't.  If there weren't GPS or cell network available, the OS would just automatically use WiFi and AGPS (IIRC) instead.  Also, if a device is lacking a camera, it's not exactly a huge issue for apps revolving around photo taking; those apps just won't support said devices.  The same happens with Android apps in the marketplace.

Though, I don't actually know the process of game design and dealing with different resolutions, so that might be different.

<TEXT> A lot of people will call you shallow, but I think they're being defensive in some manner.  Being effeminate is a large attribute to someone's personality and you're not "shallow" for finding a part of someone's personality a turn off.  Replace "effeminate" with "rude," "cocky," etc. and people will rally behind you.  (That's not to say I'm equating it with a negative descriptor, but I'm using those words to prove that you're allowed to be turned off due to someone's actions). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sigh, this makes me sad.

Beyond the whole "meeting a guy on WoW" thing, you did nothing wrong.  So you barked up the wrong tree, who cares?  How many times do you think guys hit on girls only to find out they're dating someone else?  How many times does a guy talk to a girl only to find out she's a lesbian?  How many times has a girl hit on a gay man thinking he's straight?

The straight guy should take it as a compliment.  If not, then there's something wrong with *him.*  Think about it, all you did was show interest in another human being; if they're mad about that, then they have issues, not you.  Also, never feel bad about making someone uncomfortable.  We learn and grow from discomfort.  Staying comfortable and complacent is boring and reminiscent of death, IMO.  That guy now has a story to tell, an interaction with a gay man, and you have a lesson.  None of that would've happened if you were quiet.  

Seriously, don't feel like a dick, man.  To catch a fish, fishermen have to cast countless lures and wait hours.  To find a guy, you have to put yourself out there and just hope good things come. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been using the same beard trimmer for, well, 6 years now.  It looks similar to [this](http://s4.hubimg.com/u/1369231_f520.jpg).  I use the lowest guard and then just go through the whole thing.  Next, I shave my neck using pre-shaving cream, shaving cream, and then after shave.  

This might be common knowledge/how everyone shaves, so I apologize if I'm telling you what you already know haha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're now venturing into Android OEM territory here.  Apple doesn't add things to their devices just because.  I know the original Xoom had a barometer (pressure sensor) but it didn't really have a purpose.  Adding these sensors into devices should add a benefit for their costs rather than being another bullet point on a spec sheet.  There aren't many other sensors to add in to the device that everyone would use; would a medical-based sensor be cool?  Sure.  Would it only help 1% of the iOS owners out there?  Yes, so it should be an accessory.  Why should 99% of people pay for hardware they won't use? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you understood the intricacies of processors (not saying you don't), then you would see the difference.  Adding a core is very standard today, especially because ARM processors are basically already designed and it's up to the manufcturer/designer to adopt the design and alter it.  That's what the A5 was; it was a pretty standard design that could be found elsewhere.  The new iPhone's processor is a reworking of the internal layout of a dual-core processor.  This is the first time Apple actually designed their own proc beyond looking at a specification and going from there.  The result is that it's remarkably faster than most quad-core processors because it's exceptionally designed and Apple optimized its software to use it specifically, rather than the scores of Android OEM's buying Tegra 3 from NVIDIA. 

The camera is *not* the same.  It has a much wider field of view meaning it can take more focused images up close (macro) and allow for better far away images.  Sure, it's not a large improvement, but it's an incremental improvement over the 4S, which had one of the best cameras in any smartphone.  

I don't understand how you can pick 3 improvements from the 4S and say it's a much larger improvement over the 4 while neglecting the scores of improvements the iPhone 5 has.

EDIT:  Sorry, you edited to add more.

I understand your point on the software, but the ICS point is moot.  The SII was updated to ICS around the time the SIII came out (hell, xda had it long before).  I know this because I own the SII and use it as my daily driver.  The SIII added many new software features, among them S-Beam, S Voice, Dropbox integration for international, the whole "bring it to your face to call the contact," the "flip to shut up," popup video, and more.  These features are widely believed to be useless for the majority of the population.  Though, if you want to point out the minute additions, we could count improved Siri, Do Not Disturb mode, 3D maps, PassBook, etc. which Apple actually gave to other phones/devices rather than Samsung which made SII owners purchase the SIII to get new software features.  Also, I laugh at your Jellybean point.  Not only do I have an SII that runs JB, I own (and love) the Nexus 7.  JB is the EXACT FUCKING THING iOS 6 IS.  It was used as an incremental update to speed up the software while introducing nice tweaks to make Android seem more cohesive and put together.  Though, it did add Google Now, which is just a response to Siri, which was found in iOS 5.  That's not to speak negatively of Now, though, seeing as it's mind-blowingly fast.  JellyBean did NOT bring a new interface or "a ton of features," it brought a new font, smoother animations due to Project Butter, new wallpapers, a new Phablet UI, a new Shazam-esque widget, and a nicer notification menu, IIRC.  That's hardly "an entirely updated interface and a ton of features."

I ignored the SIII's software features because they're meaningless.  You ignored iOS 6's features because they're now found across the board and are meaningless.  It's funny how we're similar, no?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And then the 5 comes out and is even more incremental

Except not.  Software-wise, yes, nothing is new.  Hardware-wise, every single part of it is different.  Better WiFi hardware, larger screen,  insanely fast processor, 2x RAM, new port (for better or for worse), much thinner/lighter, exceptional GPU, and more.  The 4S was "incremental" because it improved the camera a bit, added a second core, and Siri.  This phone much more of an improvement.  Sure, there's nothing new that your old phone couldn't do, but the same can be said about every Android phone in the last year.  We've plateaued in terms of what we can do with the power of cellphones.  The SIII has a quad-core processor (internationally), a bigger screen, and new software features which were mostly junk (including their Siri "competitor").  There's nothing spectacular about the update from SII-SIII beyond the large screen. </TEXT>

Once again, I'm not telling people to vote only Democrat or Republican; you're allowed to vote for whoever you want.  I just thought I'd point out that I disagree with the mentality of "every vote is meaningless so fuck it."  Vote green if you want.  Abstain from voting if you don't think you align with any of the candidates.  Either way, you're making an informed decision based on the views of the candidates and how they resinate with you which is a lot better than saying "every vote is meaningless." </TEXT>

Telling 500 people in Florida "that since one vote is useless, you should take voting lightly" could drastically alter the course of history.  The point is, if we're looking at this as 1/300,000,000 people, then yes it's meaningless.

<TEXT> Erm, no, no it's not.  I'm a developer, I know what it's like to develop for multiple devices and supporting a 15.98:9 device is the exact same as a 16:9 device.  Values aren't hard coded so it shouldn't matter the display size and if images were formatted in 16:9, the OS would most likely clip 1 pixel row off the end or "letter box" it by a pixel or so, which would be unnoticeable.  Though, if these images were 16:9, they would look pretty meh on a 3:2 screen, so 15.98:9 is actually much better in that situation.  Once again, for all intents and purposes, 15.98:9 = 16:9. </TEXT>

Remember that Macs are the same as Windows computers at the hardware level and Apple hips laptops that have i7 processors, 8 GB DDR3 RAM, and nice GPUs.  Basically, they're fast machines.  Are they cheap?  No.

EDIT:  Maybe you're talking about OSX availability?  Rebooting to Windows 8 from OSX takes all of 25 seconds.  It's really a non-issue. </TEXT>

The Nexus 7 is basically sold at cost and the 8 gb to 16 gb jump is $50.  I can only imagine the 16 gb to 32 gb is more expensive.  Obviously there's a mark up, but it's not to the point that it's price gouging. </TEXT>

* Mad Men
* Community
* Dexter
* The Walking Dead
* Archer
* Always Sunny
* Louie
* American Horror Story
* 30 Rock
* The Office (well, the older seasons, at least)
* Girls
* Veep
* Parks   Recreation
* Curb Your Enthusiasm
* Modern Family
* Boardwalk Empire
* Breaking Bad
* ~~Downton Abbey~~ Sorry about that, I haven't watched DA, so I didn't know it was British.
* Game of Thrones
* HIMYM
* Children's Hospital

And a lot more.

EDIT:  Seeing as everyone seems to have read over the "and a lot more," here is a list of shows other people have noted:

* Workaholics
* Homeland
* Sons of Anarchy
* Suits

Please try and remember this list is for shows that are currently running or just ended.   </TEXT>

Welcome to the trap many guys fall into when they think they're confident.  Confidence means you believe in your actions and who you are and don't care about what others think about it.  Confidence is the ability to go on a dance floor and move your hips without having the fear that someone, somewhere will think you're a joke.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously, congrats Derferman and all involved!  I've been following the progress of the game since the beginning and have had my doubts for awhile, but you've seriously quelled all of them!  As a developer, I take my hat off to you and respect you and other developers for getting through many difficult things many other developers would've given up on.  These include creating your own levels/maps, having to redo sprite sheets multiple times, implementing systems for new characters, etc.  Sure, a lot of it comes down to creativity and being able to accurately predict how Community would've done it, but you've done a fantastic job so far!  I look forward to every bit of progress! :)

Good luck guys! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That makes sense.  I have a friend who's going to school for homeopathic medicine, and I have a hard time grasping the concept (I'm an engineer).  It's interesting to me, but I've never once thought to use one of the alternative forms of "medicine" when I could just go to a doctor.  Though, it's crazy to think that there's an entire field of medicine that could actually be useful in some way but the majority of people turn away from it! </TEXT>

In workplaces, people with such leverage and pull are allowed to act any way they want to (bosses, actors, even consumers in certain situations).  They're not any more special than anyone else, but without Chevy Chase, they would've lost a very large name attached to the show which undoubtedly brought in viewers.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the reason I stopped watching Modern Family was because I was tired of Cam and Mitch.  I'm gay and I found it enfuriating that they fought every. single. episode.  My roommates say that every other family does, too, but the difference is that Cam and Mitch never resolve their issues; they sweep them under the rug at the end of each episode.  So then the writers decided they should get a *second* kid, which made no sense to me because all they ever did was fight and introducing another child would only make it worse.

<TEXT> In the years since the riots occurred, the death of gay icon Judy Garland earlier in the week on June 22, 1969 has been attributed as a significant factor in the riots, but no participants in Saturday morning's demonstrations recall Garland's name being discussed. No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although Sylvia Rivera recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, p. 190191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, "When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing." 

Wikipedia seems to disagree with you.  I'm not personally saying you're wrong, just that this note was there.  Though, thanks for educating me on the Stonewall Riots!  Now I know why Pride is in June! :) </TEXT>

This is all beyond the point.  Being a "first world" country has nothing to do with your personal happiness or your situation.  You have running tap water.  You have a job.  You have income.  You have a family.  You have a means of transportation.  You have shelter.  You have clothes.  Our country isn't any less of a developed country because people are unhappy while others are happy.  Also, the millionaire business men and engineers don't exactly sleep all day.  They have to work, too, and presumably harder than most; you can't just wake up one day at the top of the corporate ladder.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an internship in a few weeks with one of the largest tech companies in America and I asked (for #5) "Honestly, do you enjoy working for [NAME]?"  I think it was a great question because it showed that I was truly interested in *how* it feels to work there rather than just wanting to work there.  Plus, the guy seemed excited to be able to talk about his point of view on where he works.  Would you say this is a good question?

It really isn't that hard to be charismatic or engaging; just ask people about themselves.  If you allow someone the opportunity to share *their* experiences with you, I've found they'll like you 100x more than if you talk about yours. </TEXT>

Yes, the megarich are hurting the country, but to say it's not a "first world" country if you're poor is wrong.  Even if you're poor, you have access to more food, water, power, clothing, and shelter than 90% of the world. </TEXT>

Oh, who cares.  Learning about Flatland *never* gets old! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's what I said about the deleted comment:

It was originally like "Yes, tell that to every poor person in the crappy areas that try hard but can't help being poor and in shitty areas." Though, much more vulgar. He then responded to me with a lot of ramblings about how many people aren't individuals, how the American Dream is stupid, and then quoted Oscar Wilde (the irony was lost on him, apparently). Though, once again, he was much more vulgar.
I'm tired of people being too combative and litteral on reddit. 

Every quote here WILL NOT apply to everyone. Also, there will always be poor people trying to get out, but can't. It's sad, but detracting from other things because of it is a waste of time. I wonder if the original commenter hated his birthday because AIDS is prevalent in Africa? Hell, why celebrate Christmas when the housing market is in shambles?

<TEXT> That's great, but maybe that's why you're not an extremely well-paid higher up at one of the world's largest corporations.  People in business, especially higher ups, tend to put their jobs before anything and everything.  If he truly didn't want to go, he could've said no.  Sure, there would've been repercussions, but that's a result of not doing what needed to be done as a higher up. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My gripe with every programming book I've ever owned  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-10-16 20:07:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I love reading programming books; it's so easy to go to a Half-Price Books and buy a C++ book for $6 and absorb it's information in a few days time.  In fact, I have around 25 books thanks to this, but it just seems like every book I buy always has 7 intro chapters on an "if" statement and what a String is, it's ridiculous.  Is there an easier way to learn other programming languages without having to deal with this?  I just sat down to read my new Assembly book (which I paid $60 for... sigh) and apparently the first 200 pages are about the theory behind assembly, computers, programming, and more without even getting to a Hello World.  It's just a little ridiculous that I paid so much for a book that's one third basic knowledge.

<DATE> 2011-04-19 05:22:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a broke college student who has a Kindle for books and text books.  While it's an amazing little device, the small screen size makes textbook reading a huge hassle.  So, I could sell the kindle for ~120 and I have the rest (I'm not THAT broke haha) and then buy the G-Tablet for $280.  Now, my question is, is it worth it?  It's extremely cheap for a Tegra 2 10" Android device so I'm wondering about quality.  I know the screen view angles suck but is it enough to say the device is worthless?  I would love to start hacking it and then eventually putting HC on it when the source is available :)  Though, I'm afraid the dev community might not be that active?  Any thoughts would help!  Thanks guys! </TEXT>
