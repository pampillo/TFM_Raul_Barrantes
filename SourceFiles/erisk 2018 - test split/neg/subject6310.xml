<TITLE> More Connective paths between cities and other refuge areas </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 23:50:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TL;DR subway tunnels or other connections could be used to make short range weapons more viable when travelling from city to city.   

 nbsp;

So this is the conversation i've been hearing happen on the front page. 

Person A: Not enough loot with the new update can't find an AR within the city.  
Person B: You just have to search more, this is a looting battle royale game, try going to other cities.   
Person A: Yeah but to get to other places to loot i have to cross over wide open expanses and unfortunately the mini uzi and shotgun i found don't have the range or accuracy to suit the chance of a battle in that kind of environment.     
 nbsp;

I changed the wording up a bit to fit my need, but you guys get it. In this case with the new patch loot is right where it needs to be. AR's are rare and subs are not. What is not on point is the map. Besides some little clusters of cities with CQC area's, usually AR/Sniper rules the land. There are way too many open fields and expanses between cities that suit rifle play and not shotgun/smg/pistol play.   
 nbsp;

What i am suggesting for the next map is there should be more inter connectivity between the hotspots. 
Some examples could be
 nbsp;

-subway network underground that connects the cities as an alternate means of travel  
-more ridges and hills that can give cover while moving from city to city  
 nbsp;

These different networks connecting the cities could be help for any player not lucky enough to find a long range rifle in their first drop point and travel where their weapon that they picked up would be viable.   

To make these areas not so OP we could have the subway tunnel flood in certain areas (kind of like the red zone)  
   
 nbsp;

<TEXT> ah i see, i did misunderstand just a bit but you cleared it up. Originally you were playing in that style where you hunted people down, but just weren't able to find someone or got killed by someone just hiding in a corner using 3PP. So begrudgingly you decided to go with the flow of the game instead. Thanks for explaining that! What do you think they can do to quicken up that mid game? im drawing a blank </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you didn't already know, changing your characters appearance for 3k will reset your crate prices back to the original 700 price. My suggestion would be to get up to the 4200 price and pay 3k to reset your character and rinse and repeat the process. Also if you're asking, Yes you do keep your clothes that you earned. 

Bonus tip: you can right click and sell your items that have been earned </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok then there is your answer, TC stops people that are unauthorized from building in and around it. What my guess is that someone built up to your window, broke it down with tools. took your loot and jumped out and replaced the window and destroyed whatever build up they had. 

The reason for doing this is they hope you think its just a glitch that you lost all of your stuff and don't address your base flaw. Basically double dipping into your loot with the same base design. 

My suggestion Build a TC, always.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you have an accessible TC? if so they might have accessed the TC and rebuilt your base after breaking through. If not there could have been a way to jump into your base through a window. I would suggest not putting up windows unless you can afford metal window bars and they're on the 3rd floor or higher.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not quoting it out of context. You were literally talking about vending machines being used as storage. Also was the 4th comment down. Didn't have to "drudge" far. You used that word incorrectly too. For someone that uses big words i suggest looking up what they mean before using them. Using diction without knowing the correct connotation just makes you look ignorant. 

Also what law is there to not use Vending machines as storage units?

<TEXT> to combat the limited stack issue, i will be using a token system.   
- 7k sulfur for an ak  
- put my own skull in the vending machine for sale for 1 k sulfur  
- have a skull in each one of the vending machines  
- they then grab all of the skulls and place them in a shareable box  
- check the skulls and place the ak in the box  

its tedious and i have to be there for it, but hopefully they up the limit for items to 100k. Really want to sell some higher end gear.

<TITLE> (Suggestion) Master Code for code lock </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-09 16:46:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> - Code locks currently only take one code
- Have a master code that you can place in by holding the 'use' key
- Master code can only be placed by the person placing the lock
- Master code can only be applied when the lock is first placed
- Cannot remove lock without putting in the master code
- Does not matter what regular code is changed to. Master code will still unlock the door 
- 5 digits so less chance of guessing master code.


I believe if they implement the master code this will be a good QOL change. Even if someone guesses your regular code you can still use the master code to get into the doors. This could avoid people getting code raided. Also an extra level of security for players.

<TEXT> IMO, i don't think having a gun show up on a nakeds back will make me kill them less. People are going to kill for killings sake. Its what makes up a huge part of the game.  

The 2 routes this could go is:  
1. See a gun on a nakeds back and deal with the threat.   
2. Not see a gun on the nakeds back and kill him for whatever loot he could have possibly picked up.  

My proposed solution is Xray Goggles with 6x zoom and night vision. possible heat signature detecting software can be added for 1 tech trash and 6 metal frags. EZ solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> of course its a valid way of playing, but the real question is "are the majority of rust players playing that way?". I don't believe they are. So his opinions or views are skewed just a little bit.  
 nbsp;  

A good analogy is a CEO wanting to change things according to his lifestyle and not his employees even though they are living a much different life than he is and there are much more of them. </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Suggestion) Being able to ALT look around while downed. Also being able to pick yourself back up with the right medical tools. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-19 22:43:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So here is my expansion on the idea. 

1. So the timer for being down should be 20 seconds.  
2. You should be able to alt while down.  
3. If you have the right medical tool, maybe something different than the syringe to be able to dress your wound. Maybe Adrenaline shot? made with water and a new medicine component plus the usual syringe ingredients.   

Now here are the stipulations/balancing things. 
  
1. No more RNG getting up  
2. ALTing is a lower sensitivity and more restricted while on the ground (maybe fuzzy vision/blurry)  
3. the self dressing/healing takes 15 seconds to complete.  
4. Using the syringe (new medical tool) does not restart your 20 second timer while down, so there is a potential that you don't get it off in time if you're ALT looking for too long while you're down.  

Let me know what you guys think or if you have any improvements on this suggestion. 

My thinking is this will vary combat a little bit more with PVP, It will also make it so there is a lot more actual killing happening so you can see who killed you instead of them just letting you writhe on the ground and die.

I've been tracking it for the last couple of days and it seems to alternate between 2 hours and 3 hours. Somewhere in the day that changes and sometimes it comes an hour early or an hour late. 

Also what are you best tips for taking on the chopper? weapons/strats/base builds </TEXT>

<TEXT> since you're trying to be discrete, here is my advice. Now i don't know the limitations of your projects or if you're only allowed to use one shared document. I would send it to your superiors saying something along the lines of here is my portion, the others will be sending theirs in separately. If they haven't touched the shared document and expect you to do the work this is a decent way of showing that 1. you are taking owner ship for your work and 2. you can feign ignorance and say that since they did not touch the shared document you assumed they were using their own document to turn in.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So here's the trend i've been seeing since this years ToO launched. Guardians begging and pleading for a win. Messages such as...  
 nbsp;  
"we've never been to the lighthouse before, can you let us win so we can get there?"  
"just looking for a quick run through, could you guys jump off and let us through to the next match"    
"we're on our 8th win! never gone flawless before! could you please give it to us?"    
 nbsp;    
is this what its coming down to? I've replied to them with a courteous "sorry but we're also trying to get to the lighthouse"  and get messages back like     
fuck you  etc  
is anyone else getting these messages? are you ok with it?  
 nbsp;  
I know the difference of teams that have gone flawless letting people through when one of the other team's players disconnects but that decision is based on that team.   Asking guardians to step aside in the Trials of Osiris is not how its supposed to be.
