<TEXT> [Source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-blames-russia-putin-wikileaks-rele/) - honestly, where do you get your news?

On Oct. 7, however  the same day WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta  the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement that said, "The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations."

The statement added that the recent hacks "are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process."

The statement also said the intelligence community believes these attacks are directed from top levels of the Russian government, as Clinton said.

"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities," the statement said.

The U.S. Intelligence Community is made up of 17 agencies, forming the basis of Clintons claim.

The 17 agencies are: Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> if you don't trust various (17 iirc) intelligence agencies of the united states both civilian and military who have mixed political affiliations (both sides of the aisle, axes to grind in either direction) that agree on this there's literally nothing i will be able to do to convince you. so i see your 'complete speculation' and raise you seventeen intelligence agencies in consensus - your move. provide some hard evidence the russian's didn't do it (or of who did), i guess? </TEXT>

<TEXT> what influenced the voters were private emails not meant to be seen by the public. you saying the DNC has no right to privacy? a lot of what 'came out' of those emails was shit talk that you and i do all the time in emails privately. there was little in there that was newsworthy and even if there had been something truly damning and critical it should have come out legally, not through foreign interference.

setting that aside, russia hacked both sides. they could have released a ton of dirt on the republicans too, but they didn't. the had dirt on *both sides* and released only the dirt they thought would swing the campaign toward their pick (trump). this swayed the election. surely you can connect those dots. without russian involvement, the emails wouldn't have been leaked. so even if you 'blame clinton' russia remains a *critical player* in the action.

how well did it work? we'll probably never be able to quantify it, but it's fucked up from start to finish. trump *asked* a foreign power to hack us, then *reveled* in the spoils of that hack. so we have russia doing trump's dirty work. everything about his is ugly and depressing.

as an aside, if you approve of other countries hacking our systems then god help us all.

tl;dr russian hack - selective emails leaked - election influenced </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'll assume you're not joking and outline it for you. the rest you can go look up and fact check on your own. 
* (1) they hacked the DNC and the RNC, so they could have really fucked with both parties, but instead 
* (2) they released some pretty boring emails from the DNC with a few hot/controversial topics, derailing one and only one campaign in the process,
* (3) these emails became a rallying cry for critics of the clinton campaign and probably one of the most talked-about 'scandals' of the election by any reasonable metric (appeared in all media channels, debates, etc...). tl;dr they steered people from clinton toward trump

if you don't think that influenced any voters i'm sure you can go out and find some people who will tell you otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> see this is precisely what i mean. you make allegations but i'm going to go ahead with facts instead. first off, if you read the article whose headline you quoted: they meant it couldn't *literally and directly* be hacked by russia - not that russian hackers couldn't sway the election indirectly.

meanwhile, before election CNN: ["How Russia is trying to rig the US election" - 11/02](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/opinions/kremlin-trying-to-rig-election-nimmo-opinion/) or how about ["US finds growing evidence Russia feeding emails to WikiLeaks" - 10/24](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/russia-us-election/) - these are about hacking the DNC and using what they find to 'hack' (sway) the election.

If you just do a [date range Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=us+election+cnn+russia biw=1600 bih=799 source=lnt tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A9%2F1%2F2016%2Ccd_max%3A11%2F3%2F2016 tbm=) you'll find such headlines as "Vladimir Putin is trying to hack the election. What should US do ..." and "US blames Russia for targeting election systems"

the fact that you think (or hopefully now: thought) that cnn wasn't talking about russians hacking the elections in advance of the elections suggests to me you are reading fake news sites. the irony intensifies.

tl;dr you're either intentionally or accidentally conflating two uses of the term 'hacking' without actually reading the contents of the articles in question which clearly show there is no contradiction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it reflects a broader philosophy of broadly cutting federal spending, including spending on science. maybe private companies will pick up the slack but personally i would like to see a return to the 60s-era mentality that space is a priority.

i really appreciate a lot of libertarian ideals but this is one place i think there is value for the whole country (and all of humanity) to put serious amounts of resources and effort. they payoff may be less immediate or obvious but it still exists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i don't feel that safe biking in cities, but i've been meaning to try and get over that fear. it really is also a function of the kinds of distances and places you need to go and what routes are available to get there.

anyway, my larger point is that per the original example (twice a year for vacations) there may only be a few times a year that someone needs to go longer distances than their normal vehicle will allow, and usually these are planned in advance, so renting vehicles for those trips is pretty straightforward. plus on a per-mile-used basis you would get a better deal than you would for renting a car regularly for local-only travel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> on days where i'm only driving a few miles locally (or not at all), owning is cheaper. on days when i'm going to put hundreds of miles on the car in a day, it's cheaper to put those miles on a flat-rate rental vehicle, saving on periodic maintenance costs. part of how they make money on rentals is on the assumption you won't drive them that far. people who do drive them far get a better deal out of them. i also don't trust my own car as much to not break down on a long drive day. plus it takes time to pick up and drop off a rental. fine sometimes but not every day of course.

while the purpose would be a bit different i'm suggesting something similar could be done by people with lower-range "everyday" cars renting for one or two long trips a year (just without the fuel efficiency reason). </TEXT>

<TEXT> this is probably unusual but i actually rent a car for longer trips a few times a year even though i own a car. my own car is old and guzzles gas so it ends up being cheaper to rent for long trips (since they charge by the day not the mile but i still have to pay for gas *versus* adding thousands of miles and paying more for gas for my own car). </TEXT>

<TEXT> i think it's probably worth pointing out that we could be arguing over nothing, at least on the legal side of things, since a lot of countries put civic things (flags, symbols, and so on) in the public domain, and i don't know much about german copyright law anyway.

also her work isn't an exact copy. it's a partial copy, and put in a new context and medium, framed in a different way on new material. there is i think a case to me made that even if we consider the old piece art and even if it is legally or just morally protected that the new piece is art too. it could go either way.

aside from that, i get your problem is mostly about that one piece from the set, but the artist has done a wide array of pieces, so maybe she didn't think that through or maybe she got permission. again, i just don't think we know enough, hence my wanting to focus on the technique/approach and broader series.

we could argue all day about when art begins and copying ends, but this is the nature of art, isn't it? it causes us to think and discuss and debate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i've done a fair bit of printmaking in my time and i have two things to suggest you consider: [1] each woodblock print is somewhat unique due because you reink each time, [2] anyone could take a woodblock once it is carved and make a new print. so tell me: since these prints are reproducable (more or less, minus [1]) does your ability to recreate them cause you a problem in considering them art? increasingly we probably can reproduce almost any art closely (3D scanning/printing?), but we're opening up a can of worms (or soup) and i'm just not sure why exactly. meanwhile, i guarantee if you go out to reproduce these prints, there will be slight variations, too.

i also want to know the following about your last two paragraphs: are you referring to the skyline manhole cover or the rest of the work? if you're just focusing on that one, i'd grant you it could be considered 'theft' of some kind (but it could also be fair use, since the medium, context, approach and purpose are all different). but i am not trying to defend those specifically. for all we know though those covers could be public domain. but that aside.

i am just point out that there is some creativity and depth to this overall approach and series that goes beyond just going somewhere and copying something. i've done my best to explain what that "more" is to me and it sounds like we will have to agree to disagree. i like the way it bridges printmaking, stenciling and street art. i think it's creative and interesting. you don't have to and i do understand your points even if i disagree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> not trying to put words in your mouth. so you take issue with one of the pieces of the set, right? that's fine. i see the entire project as a series and am trying to point out that most of the rest of that series is not sourced from anything approximating art, so focusing on that one small piece seems like a distraction to me.

also, artist merit is not always a linear function of effort put into making art. banksy's stencils are often low-effort. the soup cans i mentioned were also low effort. a minimalist modern abstract painting can arguably have low effort. we could probably also sit down and reproduce a lot of those kinds of art. not sure how that diminishes their value.

some of the effort may also be more invisible, made up of the time spent thinking up a project, gathering materials, selecting the exact things to frame, waiting for a safe time to make the piece (in this case) on the streets. i mean if this is low effort and therefore not art, most supposedly artistic photography falls into the same category, no?

to me the art is in all of these steps and more and perhaps in the willingness to take risk. the artist is finding subjects that would make good relief prints, then sitting down and risking arrest while making the prints. art to me is often about the story of thinking of and making the thing. it is different things to different people.

PS i also like the way this plays on ideas of street art stenciling. instead of bringing a stencil to the streets, it is like they are using the streets as a reverse stencil of thoughts. in other words i like art that makes me think about other art and the relationship of art to places and different mediums. we are allowed to appreciate different things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> some of those manhole covers might qualify, but i seriously doubt the person designing barred sewer gates feels like thy were making art. also the person who designed the soup can may well consider that their artwork. also, repurposing [found designs and objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_object#Artists) is part of many types of art by many notable artists. see also: andy goldsworthy. not all art is a beautiful painting on a wall or a fancy marble sculpture. </TEXT>
