<TEXT> *Hey guys. So, I got a strange email from someone called TheMidnightRinger on gmail a few days ago. I didnt recognize the name (none of my friends are that cliche), and I assumed it was just spam, but I decided to open it a few hours ago out of boredom. The email was blank, with the Subject Line only saying LeavenedBread.01. There were audio files attached, however.  I had my computer scan them for viruses, and after deeming them safe, I gave them a listen.*

*Theyre really freaky, honestly. So freaky, I had to transcribe them and put them on here for you guys to read. Let me know what you think of them.*


Diary 1: Monday

Uh, lets see. Guess Ill introduce myself. Im John. John *unintelligible*. I go to *unintelligible* School. Thats uh, in North Carolina. We dont have much, just lots of trees. Im not a nature person, but its cool if that suits your fancy, I guess.

Now, what am I doing here? Well, Ms. Weathers, my teacher, has my English class doing this extended project. We all have to make audio logs about our daily lives, something about recording our trends and any anomalies in our otherwise consistent schedule. Yeah, I dont really get it, either. Nothing much happens here. But were allowed to talk about anything we want, no holds barred. I dont want to toot my own horn, but Im a straight A student, so I cant *not* do this assignment, you know? Its actually worth a good portion of our final grade.

Anyway, these will probably be short. Like I said, nothing much happens here, except the *unintelligible*. Otherwise, its rather boring. Lets see, today in school, I had gym, English, Geometry, and AP History. UhI ate a bologna sandwich for lunch. I walk home, I dont take the bus. No one takes the bus.

Thats it. WellactuallyLiza Brown got sick in Geometry, today. Barfed chunks everywhere. Ive never actually seen someone projectile vomit before. It was kinda cool to see, except she passed out afterward, and her nose started bleeding. Then the nurse came, Mrs. North. She *unintelligible* Mr. Humphrey was really scared, and we didnt stop talking about it until after school ended. I think shes fine, though. Shes our best tennis player. Strong, you know?

But yeah, thats about the only interesting thing to happen today. Maybe the rest of the week will be as exciting. Stay tuned, I guess.


Diary 2: Tuesday

Hey guys. Its John, John *unintelligible*. Im in my room right now to record this. If you hear any loud noises, please excuse me. There have been a lot of cars going by our street lately.

Anyway, something *interesting* happened today. I mentioned a girl named Liza Brown in my previous recording, and how she got sick. Well, rumor is apparently she got hit with some really weird bug, and she may have been contagious. We got the whole works: announcement by Principal Rogers over the intercom, a lecture on washing our hands. We even got sent home early, and told not to touch any weird plants or substances we didnt recognize. I havent seen anything strange lately, so I think Im okay.

Anyway, I called my mom and told her about what happened. She just told me to stay inside. Its kind of boring, staying inside, you know? I guess I get to play video games, but all of mine are pretty old. Everyone has the new Playstation, but Ive still got the second one. They dont really make games for it anymore.

Ms. Weathers told us to continue making these diaries. Today will be a great anomaly for you to discuss in your recordings, she said. I think Im going to keep it brief though, to save you the trouble. If you found my recordings, Im sure youve found someone elses. Theyre probably more interesting than me. 

I dont think Ms. Weathers knows about Liza. The principal told us not to talk about her, so she mustve been out of the loop. Im sure its common knowledge though, *everybody* is talking about her. 
I dont know how shes doing. I hope shes okay.

Stay tuned, I guess.


Diary 3: Wednesday

Hi. Its John. Im still in my bedroomyeah. I havent been able to leave the house. Like, literally. I was watching the news this morning, when I was eating my cereal, getting ready for school. The mayor has the town basically on lockdown. Theres a curfew at 6 pm, and the only ones allowed out past that are people with Class 3 clearance. Ive never heard that term spoken on our news station before, it was kind of spooky. Like were in some kind of sci-fi movie. I then found out that all schools are closed for today.

Thing is, my mom manages the Research Lab at *unintelligible*, the local university. She called me at around lunchtime, and told me she wouldnt be home for a while. She got an immediate job upgrade, which would be exciting if under some different circumstances. Shes Class 3 now. She wont tell me what that means. She couldnt even tell me about what her old job entailed. I guess its all hush-hush.

My English class has been emailing each other, non stop. Graham *unintelligible* is refusing to do this assignment, but the rest of us think hes overreacting. Hes freaking out over Liza, and thinks what happened to her is connected to whats happening around the city. I mean, no ones allowed to enter or leave.  But, shes just one girl. I dont know how she got sick, but I havent heard of anyone else exhibiting the same symptoms. Im sure its just the flu, or something.

Which is weird, because we havent had a flu bug around here in two years.


Diary 4: Friday

Hey, its John. I know, I skipped a day, but, someinteresting things happened. My mom is still at *unintelligible* University. My dad has been missing for seven years. Sorry, that doesnt matter. Um, what Im getting at is that Im currently alone in the house.

Yesterday, the cable news ran all day instead of ending at 11, its usual time. They reported some people getting sick. Projectile vomiting, bloody noses, and a new symptom, swelling in the throat and brain. It sounds like Liza. I know I told you guys that I hadnt heard of anyone else coming down withwhatever this is, butits happening. Not going to lie, Im scared. So scared, I did some research.

Im friends with a few people in Geometry, so I texted them, and theyre all feeling okay. They dont know of anyone else getting sick, either. Those guys on the news are all over 40, but come from pretty different backgrounds and cultures. Liza is the only young one that I know of. Not only that, but her name wasnt listed on the news report. That caught my attention.

Shes like, Patient Zero, right? Or at least, I think she is. She was the first case I know of, but its actually more likely that someone somewhere else came down with this illness before her. Question is, how exactly did Liza get it? And is it really contagious?

Only time will tell. But now, another anomaly. Its like 11 in the morning, right now. The news has been talking about the weather for the last two hours. Yes, the weather. There has been no rain, even though theres a 79% chance of it. The sun has been shining, there hasnt been a hint of a cloud. Its very benign, yet strange. And highly annoying. I want them to talk about this sickness, or this lockdown. ANYTHING else. 

I want this curfew to be lifted. I want to leave the house. I CAN leave, but my mom told me not to. Im not going to leave the house. When will she be home?


Diary 5: Saturday

Its John. The news hasnt been on all day. Ive been watching Tom and Jerry since 7 this morning. Its weird, I havent woken up that early to watch cartoons since I was a kid. Heck, I havent woken up that early on a Saturday period.

Im honestly so bored. I tried to play video games, but staring at the screen for so long hurt my eyes. I then tried to take a nap, but my mind was racing. So, I decided to record another one of these. Im not going to lie, Im kind of terrified. I dont know whats going on outside. Every time I look out the window, I see an empty street. I havent heard any cars going by. A dog used to bark, but now it doesnt. I dont even hear my neighbors opening their front doors or garage doors anymore. Its almost like were under lockdown in our homes, too. 

I want to leave. I can leave. But my mom told me not to. I think I should listen to her? I should, right? 

I think she came home late last night. I fell asleep at around 2 am, playing around on my phone. Im upset I missed her. She made me a bowl of cereal and left it on the coffee table. She mustve been in a hurry. I havent eaten it yet. Im not hungry. I should eat it soon, before it gets all soggy. I wish shed called me.


Diary 6: Sunday

We havent gone to church since my father went missing seven years ago. I dont remember the experience, much. I dont know why I keep bringing my dad up.

My mom called me today, finally. She apologized for not having been home. I told her it was fine, she must be really busy. She still cant tell me whats shes working on. She sounded tired. I told her to make some cereal and she laughed, called me weird. Then she had to go. She only gets short breaks. 

She came home again last night, though. I never ate the cereal, and I never moved it. This morning I found it in the bathroom, just chilling in the bathtub. Shes playing a joke on me, Im sure. She has to be. All the doors and windows are locked. I havent gone outside yet.

I tried texting a few people today, but most of them didnt answer me. Graham and Marcila did, though. I probably shouldve mentioned Mar before. Shes one of my best friends. I dont know why she hasnt come up yet. Maybe because of this sickness business.

Well, two drastically different conversations. I should note that my wifi is painfully slow. I only have enough patience to write and upload these, browsing any other site is just not worth the time and effort. Grahams wifi is much faster than mine, since he lives in *unintelligible*. Its a nice place. Smelly, though.

Hes been finding out as much as he can about the sickness. So far, there havent been any other documented cases. He thinks there are more though, but THEY arent telling us. I asked him to tell me what THEY he was referring to, but he just told me The Other Ones. Grahams always been kinda quirky, so I left it at that.

He asked me if Id been by the school yet. I told him I couldnt leave the house. He asked me why not. I told him *unintelligible*. He started to cry, and then he didnt reply to any of my other texts. I dont know what happened. Honestly, remembering our conversation makes me exhausted. Think Ill take a nap.

Ill tell you about my friend Mar, tomorrow.


Diary 7: Monday

Its John. The news finally came back on, again. Much to my chagrin, all they said was that the schools would reopen tomorrow, but the curfew was still in place. Then, the weather. I couldnt stand another three hours of them discussing the high chances of snow despite it being Springtime, so I turned it off. Im happy things will be getting back to normal.

Oh yeah, Marcila. When I talked to her, she was just as freaked out as me over the turn of events. She and her family were told by their neighbors not to go into town to buy anything. I have enough in my house where Id be okay, especially since I live alone, but she has parents and siblings who must be taken into account. They need to eat. Her older brother went into town to buy something, apparently, but he has yet to come back. Yeah, I talked to her not too long ago today, as well. He still hasnt been back. No calls, no messages, anything. Her folks are worried sick.

When I told her not to go outside, she told me to stop being ridiculous. I told her that if she went outside, she needed to stay on her property. I dont know if she took me seriously, but I hope she does. Maybe it will be okay, now that the schools will be open. But my mom hasnt told me to leave the house yet. I dont want to leave the house yet.

I dont know why she wont just wake me up when she comes home at night. Its like a game, now. I havent touched that bowl of cereal, and my mom is just moving it around the house. Yeah. Today I found it in my closet. Oddly enough, the milk is still pearly white, and the frosted and dried flakes of wheat arent soggy at all. Its almost so perfect that I dont want to eat it even if me and my mom werentdoing whatever it is were doing.


Diary 8: Tuesday

My mom called me, just before I was about to leave for school. She told me not to leave the house. Then she hung up. I didnt leave. I havent left the house, yet. Im doing what she told me.

I got the worst anxiety attack today. I had to sit in my closet, in the dark, for a while to calm down. I took the cereal with me. I havent eaten it yet. For some reason, it comforted me immensely. Ive never noticed it before, but it smells a lot like lemons. I like lemons.

Anyway, the news keeps talking about the weather. I dont know where they get off on this stuff. Its been sunny and perfect all day every day since last week. Theres been no hail, or snow, or rain, or an intensely thick fog. Its so annoying I can hardly stand to watch it, anymore.

I talked to Mar about my frustration. She told me that her younger sister went outside to play in the backyard the other day, and came back soaking wet, and gaunt, like she hadnt eaten in weeks. She was only outside for fifteen minutes. It really freaked her out. I mean, it sounds freaky right? But Ive seen her sister, and she was already pretty skinny. I think shes overreacting. Anyway, I told her not to go to school, and she said she couldnt go anyway, since her sister recently came down with something and she had to help take care of her. She wont tell me if that something was the same as what Liza had.

I spoke to Graham, too. He said he went to school today. Thats it. I asked him how it went, how he was doing. Then he told me, Just come to school. Now THAT started to freak me out. Hes a paranoid conspiracy theorist, and he hasnt addressed me that calmly sinceI dont even know when. I dont know whats changed in him. I asked him if he researched anything else. 

All he tells me is to come back to school.


Diary 9: Wednesday

Today I found the bowl of cereal in the strangest place yet. It was in my drawer, stuffed inside one of my socks. Yeah. I didnt think they could stretch that much, butthey can. It wasnt wet or anything. When I pulled it out, carefully mind you, the cereal was still pretty perfect. Im sure it would be spoiled by now, right? Yet its not. Still smells like lemons.

Anyway, I spent the majority of my day wondering what to do with my time. Ive read every book in this house. Played half of my games from start to finish. Im probably going to do the other half tomorrow. Youd think a week without school would be more enjoyable. Maybe its because I cant leave the house.

I tried to call my mom today, but she didnt answer. Its been a while since we talked. I dont know why she wont just speak to me when she comes home? Maybe she wants me to get my sleep. I think Im going to stay up all night, and wait for her. Maybe then we can eat the cereal. Maybe then she can tell me why I cant go outside.


Diary 10: Thursday

I tried, I really tried. I even took a nap yesterday to make sure I stayed up all night. I dont know what happened. I sat in the living room, watching cartoons, waiting for my mom to get home. The front door never opened. I thought I saw the headlights of her jeep through the window at around 3 am, but I guess it was something else.

I STAYED AWAKE ALL NIGHT. I know I did. The sun came up. The newws came on. I even sat through the boring weather until 1 pm. I was so tired. So tired. But before I gave up and took a nap, I looked around.

The cereal bowl, which I left on the kitchen counter, had been moved to the basement. Just sitting thhere, on the dirty floor. I dont know how my mother doees it. Not only is the basement door just a few feet away from the back of the couch, but its super squeaky. I would have heard it if it opened. I didnt hearr anything, at all. I wish shed stop doing this to mee. She wont answer my calls or texts. Im worriied.

I dont know if sshes the one moving the cereal. I dont know why it hasnt spoiledd yet. I dont know why I cant go outside. I waant to try, but I cant. I cant.

Ddoes anyone else experience this? Or am I going crazy?


Diary 11: Friday

I feel like Im the only one alive. I texted Mar today, just to feel sane. Her sister has gotten worse, apparently. Right before the news started reporting nonstop about the weather, we were warned to call a hotline about any friends or family members whod come down with those strange symptoms. Mars family doesnt want to report her sister, because they think shell get taken away. I understand their fear, as they have yet to hear from Mars older brother. But Im worried about them. They might get sick, too. Theyre steadily running out of food. 

Mars father wants to go into town and buy something, but Mar and her mother keep him from leaving. Thats smart. They tried dialing the neighbors for help. No one replied. Theyre at a loss.

I tried texting some of my friends and classmates. None of them reply. Not even Graham, anymore. I checked my email today, and the last two were from Ms. Weathers and Nurse North. Ms. Weathers is worried about my attendance and wants me to come back to class. I didnt know what to say, so I havent replied yet.

Mrs. North sent out a more generic message, that I think she sent to all the students. All about the importance of washing our hands. Except, theres something weird with it. I cant put my finger on it. For one, shes the only other adult Ive seen mention the strange sickness, which Ive come to call the D-Disease. Second, her word choice is just plain strange. Here is her email:

Greeting students!

   Hello, this is Mrs. North. Each of you will be receiving this email. Lately, you may have heard about a few people catching the flu. Please do not be alarmed about this news, but do take it seriously. 

Remember to keep up your personal hygiene! Everyone has germs, and we must do our part not to spread them. Allergies go absolutely haywire at this time of year. Dont forget to cover your cough!

Teachers, dont think that excludes you! Half of the work lies on you, as well. Educate your students on the proper way to clean their possessions, and their hands. You are responsible.

Hopefully, this email has reached your ears. Encourage your friends and family to stay healthy and wash their hands. Always remain steadfast in the fight against germs. Read this email carefully!

-North.


We havent been told to wash our hands so many times since elementary school. Im sure theres more to all of this. I just have to figure it out.

In other news, I cant find the bowl of cereal. Its hidden somewhere real good this time. Do I even want to find it? Im not sure. Itll pass the time at least.

I want to keep these up. They help me keep my sanity. Who knows, someone might find these, and be able to give me a few answers. Every day is getting harder and harder. Hopefully things will get back to normal, soon.


*Thats that, for now. I dont know what to make of them. TheMidnightRinger sent me these yesterday, so maybe hell send more later. It sounds like John has more to tell us, and honestly, Im curious as to whats going on. My cousin was vomiting nonstop two days ago and its really worrying me.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, it's human nature to look at something. Plus didn't Monokuma tell Naegi about the "attacker" before the despair hypnotism set in? I imagine that'd make any FF member curious enough to take a second look.
Plus, I think a very select few even knew about the possibility of getting hypnotized. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even though anime Chiaki was more of a Mary Sue, and her living for so long after being literally speared in multiple places, I think her dying words are more realistic. She still wanted to help people (reminiscent of game Chiaki) but it's more real and relatable with the "I don't want to die" line. But that's my opinion on it. Regardless, I think anime Chiaki's Mary Sue personality also made her confident (like still wanting to see her friends even after Chisa said she could turn back, plus her whole arc with being introverted and then being the class rep who played games with everyone and organized events). Sure it's not as similar for the game Chiaki we know, but it's still confidence. </TEXT>
